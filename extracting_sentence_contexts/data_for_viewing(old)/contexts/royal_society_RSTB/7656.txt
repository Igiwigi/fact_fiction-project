considerable size (figure 4). This trunk gave off the internal carotid and ascending pharyn-
geal arteries and then divided, the major branch passing on towards the cranium, which
it entered between the atlas and the occipital bone. Within the skull on the upper surface
of the basi-sphenoid the occipital artery of each side supplied a large arterial plexus which
had, in addition, connexions with the vertebral arteries. This basi-sphenoidal arterial plexus
communicated directly with the posterior part of the carotid rete of each side (figure 28).

The circle of Willis

Apart from the fact that the circle of Willis receives part of its blood supply from the
internal carotid arteries and from the occipital arteries via the basi-sphenoidal plexus, the
vessels related to the circle are essentially similar to those seen in the sheep and the goat.
The basilar artery is again a relatively insignificant vessel, diminishing in calibre caudally
(figure 29).

PIG, Sus scrofa
(Figures 5; 31, 32, plate 18; 33, plate 19)

In the pig the carotid rete is situated intracranially within the cavernous sinus, but it
lies more posteriorly than in the other artiodactyls. When compared with the latter
animals, however, certain marked differences are found in the vessels which supply the rete.
