+ It can also be shown that K, contains five general -surfaces ; so that of the fifteen planes of V,°, ten
correspond to the planes joining the ten chords to P and five correspond to @-surfaces lying on Ks.

t In fact if we take the coordinates of a point in S, to be (a, 6, ¢, fg, h) we can take the Veronese surface

to be given by

The six quadrics through this surface are then given by the minors A, B, C, F, G, H of this matrix, and the
symmetry arises from the fact that the minors of

are proportional to a, b, ¢, f, g, h.
