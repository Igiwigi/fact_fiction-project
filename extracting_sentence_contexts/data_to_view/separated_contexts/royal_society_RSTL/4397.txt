So, likewise, with the teeth : the same individual tooth cannot be traced
from fish to fish, or from reptile to reptile; the teeth in the cold-blooded classes differ
too much in their number in different individuals, and too little in their development
and snccession, to yield the requisite characters to the homologist who keeps his
faculty of comparison under due control. In those Mammalia, likewise, as e. g.
the Cachalots, Dolphins and Armadillos, in which the teeth are very variable in
number and often very numerous, but without any definite order of shedding and
replacement, no particular tooth can be identified and traced from one species to
another. AND A DENTAL NOTATION. 493

The elass Mammalia presents, in fact, two primary conditions of the dental system,
according to which it might be divided into,—

1st. Those that generate one set of teeth, or the © Monophyodonts *,” and

2nd. Those that generate two sets, or * Diphyodonts +.”

The © Monophyodonts* include the orders Monotremata and Bruta (or the Edentata
of Covier) and the Cetacea vera of CuvIgR.
