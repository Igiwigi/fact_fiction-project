5 to every two impulses. The possibility of such a causation for the production of the
A half-rhythm is shown by the fact that eurare or muscarin, when applied to the ventricle
alone, does ultimately cause that muscle to beat synchronously with every gecond
auricular beat, without any alteration of the rate of the auricular contractions.

It is, however, to be noticed that these poisons never produce this effect until they
have acted 80 powerfully upon the muscular tissue of the ventricle as markedly to lower
the strength of its contractions ; that, in fact, as one would expect, any method by
which the excitability of the muscle is lowered to such an extent that it is only able to
respond to every 8econd impulse, must at the same time greatly diminish the strength
of the contractions of that muscle.

This fact that a diminution of the contraction force accompanies the production of

the half-rhythm when it is clearly due to a diminution in the excitability of the ven-
trieular musele, points unmistakably to the conclusion that the half-rhythm caused by
clamping, in which, as has been shown, the ventricle contracts with greater force than
before the clamp was tightened, is nob due to any diminution of muscular excitability
caused by the action of the clamp. This is further shown by the following facts â€”
