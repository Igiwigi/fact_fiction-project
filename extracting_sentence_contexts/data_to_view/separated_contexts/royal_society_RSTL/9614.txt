It was long doubtful whether or not these lapel to the supposed
Peronosporites, but T have now no doubt as to their doing 80, Their diameter is about
the same as that of the oogonia, of the branching specimens, and I found one in a_small
cluster of these objects which had developed into the state corresponding to that
represented by fig. 37. T have occasionally found long branching hyphe without any‚Äù dilatations, and which,
being associated with the branching ones, I presume belong to the same plant, since
they differ in no respect from the shorter hyphz of the latter. From these facts it
would appear that this organism began as a single spore-like cell within the cells and
vessels of other plants. This cell threw ont from one to three short hyphe, each of
which developed a capsule like an oogonium at its extremity, which, in turn, repeated
the same process until a complex branching structure was produced. But under some
other cireumstances longer branching hyphee, either devoid of oogonia or only bearing
them at much longer intervals, were produced.
