viz. when 9 is fractional there is the discontinuity of law, inasmuch as the term changes

from EE to == but when 9 is integral this discontinuity disappears. The like

considerations, using of course the proper formula for the attraction of the disk, would
apply to the case q=0 or negative.

25. Or again, we might use the formulee which belong to the case of a uniform (s+1)-
coordinal spherical shell (see Annex No. IIL.), viz. we decompose the surface as follows,

surface=disk +residue of surface ;
and then, considering a spherical shell touching the surface at the point in question
(0 that the disk is in fact an element common to the surface and the spherical shell),
and being of a uniform density equal to that of the disk, we have
disk=spherical shell—residue of spherical shell ;
and consequently
surface=spherical shell— residue of spherical shell+residue of surface ;

and then, considering the attracted point as passing through the disk, it does not pass
through either of the two residues, and there is not any discontinuity, as regards the
prepotentials of these residues respectively ; there is consequently, as regards the pre-
potential of the surface, the same discontinuity that there is as regards the prepotential
of the spherical shell. But I do not further consider the question from this point of view,
