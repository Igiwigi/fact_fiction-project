It is best to
assume that M is globally hyperbolic, as this ensures that PV is a Hausdorff (5-real-dimensional)
space [11]. If we include a (null-vector) momentum p (index form p,), pointing along each ray and
parallel-propagated along it—to give what I call a scaled ray—then we get a 6-real-dimensional
space p\, whose points represent these scaled rays. In fact, pN is naturally a real symplectic


6-manifold, with symplectic potential 1-form ® and closed symplectic 2-form Z, given [2] by
G=pidx", L=db&=dp, A dx"

(where, in coordinate notation, ‘dx*’ stands for the coordinate 1-form basis, and in abstract
indices dx“ is just a ‘Kronecker delta’ translating the abstract index on ‘p,’ to conventional 1-
form notation). When PV = PN, so our symplectic 6-manifold is the canonically given pN(=pV),
we can apply twistor notation, finding

® =iZ"dZy =-iZ,dZ", EY =db =idZ% A dZy. Equality of the two expressions for follows from the nullity of Z%, since 0 = d(Z%Zq) = Z¢dZ +
ZqAZ.
