How do we meet three central challenges of the Anthropocene: mitigating and
adapting to climate change, protecting biodiversity and ensuring human well-
being? A major part of the answer lies in addressing these interdependent
challenges together; to do otherwise invites negative consequences and unin-
tended feedbacks. Indeed, the ethos of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable
Development Agenda is one of connectivity, inclusivity and partnership; it
acknowledges interdependencies of the 17 social, environmental and economic
goals and encourages actions that promote synergies among them [1]. Yet,
despite the importance of taking account of synergies and trade-offs between
these goals [2-4], there is little evidence that this is happening in practice. As
a direct result, many goals are unlikely to be met by 2030. In particular, the fail-
ure to stabilize and adapt to climate change (SDG 13) [5] or protect biodiversity
(SDGs 14 and 15) [6,7] has been exacerbated by the fact that these issues are
being treated separately when in fact they are deeply interwoven and share
many of the same drivers.

It is against this backdrop that nature-based solutions (NbS)—solutions to
societal challenges that involve working with nature (box 1)—are emerging
as an integrated approach that can reduce trade-offs and promote synergies
