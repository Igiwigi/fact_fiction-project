the equation whereof may also be written

97+4y+5=(y—1)V25—99.

297. This is a cubic curve, viz. it is a divergent parabola having for axis the line
9: +4y+5=0, and its ordinates parallel to the axis of #; and having moreover a node
at the point &==—1, y=+1, that is, at the node-cusp of the bicorn ; the curve is thus
a nodal cubic; we may trace it directly from the equation, but it is to be noticed that
qua nodal cubic it is a unicursal curve; the coordinates a, y are therefore rationally
expressible in terms of a parameter 4}; and it is easy to see that we in fact have

whence also
