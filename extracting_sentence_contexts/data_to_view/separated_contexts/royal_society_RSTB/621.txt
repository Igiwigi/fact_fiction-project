6, section at 4th dorsal, shows that the degeneration is not limited to
the side of the lesion, although that is much more extensive. Perhaps this
may have been due to the pressure of the fibrous nodule found at the seat
of the lesion adherent to the cord. The interest of this case lies, however,
in the fact that on the side of the lesion, and where the greatest amount of
degeneration existed, there was anesthesia and analgesia (vide p. 9 and
fig. 4, Plate 3).
