S five crops alternated with fallow, the five intermediate crops of beans have, in addition

© to this, themselves carried off more than the same amount of Nitrogen as the wheat—

= namely, 244-5 lbs.

S The general result is, then, that pretty nearly the same amount of Nitrogen was taken

5 from a given area of land in wheat, in ten years, whether ten crops were grown Ccon-

E secutively, five crops in alternation with fallow, or five crops in alternation with beans.

z In fact, the crop of wheat was increased fully as much when it succeeded Deans, which

S carried off a large amount of Nitrogen, and of mineral matters also, as when it succeeded

S fallow, which conserved the stores both of Nitrogen and of mineral matter.

It will be seen, by the illustrations given in the next sub-section (C.), that the experi-

-2 mental results thus far adduced are perfectly consistent in character with those obtained

E under cireumstances more nearly allied to those of ordinary farm practice.
