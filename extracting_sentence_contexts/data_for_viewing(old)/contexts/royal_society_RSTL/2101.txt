and plate, —the intensity which can be excited in each by a
given inducing source—the quantity of that inducing action
which can be transmitted through the interstices of the
screen—the time each body takes to acquire and give up
electricity—before we can attempt accurately to predict the
result of any proposed arrangement.

There is another circumstance in which the above expla-

nation agrees well with the observed facts ; since the motion
communicated to the needle is the difterence of two forces,
each of which is very small, it must itself be 'smaller than
either; and in case of any approach to equality in those
opposing forces, it will become exceedingly minute.

With respect to the action of heat in encreasing these rota-
tions, I am inclined to conjecture, that the distribution of
electricity on the metallic plate is altered by the application
of heat; that the part under the needle becoming electrified,
produces in it induced electricity ; and thus the plate being
made to revolve, the rotation of the needle follows from the
explanation previously given. It may, however, happen,
