The resistive term can be simplified using the identity —V x (nV x B) = noV2B — Ving x (V x
B) with V.B = 0. The thermoelectric term can be simplified with the same identity, along with the
fact that V x VT, =0.

The final form of the induction equation is therefore composed only of an advection term, a
diffusion term, the resistivity gradient term and two source terms that are still active even when
B=0[9],
