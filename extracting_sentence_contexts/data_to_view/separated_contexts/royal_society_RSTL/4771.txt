It is quite certain,
from my own previous observations and those since made by M. Acass1z's directions
on the glacier of the Aar, that the movement thus shown to have continued seventeen
days without a saltus would have continued the whole season in the same manner. In fact, the deformation or flexure thus observed being sufficient to account for the
whole excess of the central above the lateral motion, is in itself an explanation, and a
proof that the explanation is adequate, and leaves nothing residual to be accounted
for by saltus√û. I have more to add on this subject, but shall first give an account of an extension
of this experiment on the actual flexure of the ice, upon 80 elaborate a scale as I
scarcely ventured to hope would prove successful, especially as the time I could devote
to watch its progress was small, and the circumstances of weather excessively un-
favourable. Having succeeded s0 well with the thirty feet station in the transverse line, I
thought of multiplying the points of observation till further, s0 as to obtain a polygon
of flexure more nearly approaching to a curye.
