Assuming

from other behavioural parameters and demonstrate that an shows that the observed fitness advantage of N2 over npr-1
advantage of npr-1 remains under patchy food conditions if worms is in fact dissociable from their collective phenotypes

not for its lower feeding rate. [22]. Indeed, we show that N2’s better foraging performance


may be more attributable to its higher feeding rate than to its
foraging strategy. Therefore, even though our strain-specific
model suggests that collective foraging is not a more efficient
strategy, at least under our tested food distribution conditions,
our minimal model and modified strain-specific model (with
equal feeding rates and smoothly varying inhomogeneous
food) indicate that this remains a theoretical possibility.
