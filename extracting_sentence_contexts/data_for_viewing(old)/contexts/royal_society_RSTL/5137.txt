Ethan is the case with mere white paper*. This phenomenon was attributed by Sir
SJonx to a peculiarity in its reflecting power, and was considered as a proof of the
Svisibility of the ultra-violet rays. The colour of the prolongation of the spectrum
Ewas yellowish green. Sir Joan appears to have been in doubt whether the greenish
gyellow colour was to be attributed to the mixture of the true colour of the ultra-
violet rays with the yellow of the paper due to diffused light, or to the real colour of
the ultra-violet rays themselves, which on that supposition would have been incor-
rectly termed © lavender.”

88. The fact of the change of refrangibility of light having been established, there
could be little doubt that the true cause of the extraordinary prolongation of the
spectrum on paper washed with tincture of turmeric, was very different from what
Sir Jonn HerscneL had supposed, and that it was due to a change of refrangibility
in the incident light, which was produced by the medium in a solid state. Tincture
of turmeric has already been mentioned as a medium which possesses in a high
