The cells of the notochord are consider-
> ably vacuolated; but the segmental duct is still without a lumen. The posterior nerve-
S rudiments are elongated, pear-shaped bodies of considerable size, and, growing in a
S\entral direction, have reached a point nearly opposite the base of the neural canal.
& They till remain attached to the top of the neural canal, though the connexion has in
each case become a pedicle s0 narrow that it can only be obseryed with great difficulty.
Â© It is fairly certain that by this stage each posterior nerve-rudiment has its own
S 8eparate and independent junction with the spinal cord; their dorsal extremities are
S nevertheless probably connected with each other by a continuous commissure. A The cells composing the rudiments are still round, and have, in fact, undergone no
important modifications since the last stage. The important feature of the section figured (fig. D b), and one which it shares with
the other sections of the 8ame embryo, is the appearance of connective-tissue cells around
the nerve-rudiment. 'These cells arise from two sources; one of these is 8upplied by
the vertebral rudiments, which at the end of the last stage (Plate 16. fig.
