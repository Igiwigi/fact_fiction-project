bones which were transmitted with that armour by Sir Wooppixg Parsn, M. Lau-
RILLARD had recognized a calcaneum, an astragalus and a scaphoid, differing from
those of the living Armadillos only by their size and by some merely specific modifi-
cations þ.

But that which Baron Cuvier and M. LaumiLarp had ventured to regard as
very possible, and Dr. BuckLand as probable, M. ps BLaixviLLE a few years later
announced to be a positive fact. He communicated, in 1839, to the Academy of
Sciences of the French Institute, a statement that bones of the Megatherium had
recently been discovered, accompanied with fragments of a carapace belonging in-
dubitably to the same animal; and he adds that the association of a bony armour
with the internal skeleton of the Megatherium can be demonstrated as surely by
@ priori reasoning as by the & posteriori fact; but he adduces no observations or
arguments from the skeleton in addition to those of which Dr. BuckLaxd had pre-
viously availed himself, simply affirming that © the Megatherium is proved to have
been certainly covered by an osteo-dermal carapace, by the disposition of the spinous
processes of the vertebra, by the angles of the ribs, by the articulation of the pelvis
with the vertebral column,” &c.; and he concludes by announcing © that the Mega-
therium was a gigantic species of Armadillo, most nearly allied to the diminutive
Chlamyphorus \.”
