i The large proportion of root and its gmall proportion of Nitrogen, as here exhibited,
are equally remarkable. Whether this great power of the plant to develop root be due
to the fact that the process of cell-formation in the root requires less of the nitrogenous
protoplasmic compound, or to the fact that, floating in water as these roots generally
were, that fluid facilitated the withdrawal of the nitrogenous constituents resulting from
the decomposition of protoplasma from the old cells, to form new protoplasma for the
more actiye cells, is a question which, though foreign to our present subject, is of con
siderable interest in a physiological point of view. The fact that the roots from the
base of the stem penetrated the oil, giving off very few branches into it, but immedi-
ately on reaching the water at the bottom of the pot exhibited such a remarkable deve-
lopment (se Notes on taking up the Wheat Plants, Appendix, p. 560), is in fayour
of the inference that the water afforded the necessary conditions for the character of
growth referred to. J
