The main growth of the trunk now concerns the dorsal portions
of the segments, and these grow very rapidly for about two days or less, until they are as
broad as are the ventral portions. Most of this growth centres in the dorsal mesentery,
which is obviously very short when first formed by the meeting of the tapered dorsal
extremities of the segmental blocks. Mitotic division stages are very numerous in
sections of the dorsal mesentery at this time, text-fig. 18, but it is a very puzzling fact

that no division stages have been observed in the ectoderm of this dorsal region during
the period of rapid growth, although a considerable number of larve have been studied. One can only conclude that the ectoderm is here increasing in length by changes in the
shape and position of the cells on either side of the mid-dorsal line. As cell boundaries
cannot be distinguished with any certainty, it has not been possible to prove this.
