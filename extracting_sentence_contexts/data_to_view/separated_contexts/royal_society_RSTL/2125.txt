44 Mr. x1NG's Account of a

curious fas, which he permits me now to mention in
this paper.

. On paſſing through the ftireets of London in his
walks, before the ſign-irons were taken down, he per-
ceived, that on the broad ſtone pavements, whenever he
came juſt under any fign-irons, his cane gave a different
ſound, and occaſioned a different kind of reſiſtance to
the hand, from what it did elſewhere; and attending
more particularly to this circumſtance, he found, that
every where, under the drip of thoſe irons, the ſtones
had acquired a greater degree of ſolidity, and a wonder-
ful hardneſs, fo as to reſiſt any ordinary tool, and gave,
when ſtruck upon, a metallic found: and this faCt, by
repeated obſeryations, he was at length moſt thoroughly
convinced of,

Taking the hint, therefore, from hence, he thought
fit to make ſeveral experiments; and, amongſt the reſt,
placed two pieces of Portland ftone in the fame aſpe&t
and ſituation in every reſpect, but waſhed the one fre-
quently with water impregnated with ruſty iron, and left
the other untouched: and in a very few years he found
the former had acquired a very ſenſible: degree of that
hardneſs before deſcribed, and on being fruck gave the
metallic ſound; whilſt the other remained in its original
Mate, and ſubject to the decays occaſioned by the changes:

of his having found on the ſea-coaft near Scarborough,
many years ago, part of an horſe-ſhoe incruſted with ſea
S ' ſand, which was ſo concreted as to have acquired the
5 hardneſs of common grit ſtone, and retained the colour
S of the ſand, with very little tincture of the iron ochre:

jt appeared moſt probable, that the Horſe-ſhoe had not
