chance of exceeding any assigned rare value nearly p times. Thus for x = 13, 0-6
will not be judged significant, even for a single variate correlated if p exceed 2, 0-7
ceases to be significant if p > 7, and 0:8 when p exceeds about 54. When we consider
that p may be very great, since not only is the number of meteorological elements avail-
able for selection large, but also since many writers allow themselves to use complicated
functions of the instrumental data, involving adjustable weights, special conventions
of sign, and allowances for periods judged to be unusual in their effects, so that these
artificial meteorological data may be calculated in an enormous variety of ways, it is
clear that the conclusions we have drawn as to the dangers of applying multiple corre-
lation formule to small samples, are very much to be emphasised when a choice is made
as to what meteorological elements to correlate.

In view of the foregoing facts it would seem worth while to lay down the following
conditions for arriving at unprejudiced. results :â€”

(i) The meteorological variates to be employed must be chosen without reference
to the actual crop record.

(ii) If multiple variates are to be used allowance must be made for the positive
bias of R*.

(iii) Relationships of a complicated character should be sought only when long
series of crop data are available.
