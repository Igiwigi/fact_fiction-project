In all cases, these measured interferences were negligible. Mass discrimination was
corrected using the double spike, as detailed previously [3,17,19,54]. All the double spikes in our
laboratory are cleaned of other elements before use, by passage through equivalent columns to
those we use for samples, and to allow spiking of the same sample for multiple elements despite
the fact that for example the (uncleaned) Zn spike contains small amounts of Ni impurity, etc. All
Ni and Zn isotopic compositions are given in standard notation as follows relative to the NIST
SRM986 and JMC Lyon Zn standards, respectively:

Long-term reproducibility of isotopic analyses was +0.06%o for both isotope systems. This was
assessed over the course of this and parallel studies, through repeat measurements of primary
JMC and NIST standards as well as a secondary standard each for Zn (IRMM-3702) and Ni (USGS
Fe-Mn nodule, Nod-P1, digested and passed through the Ni column chemistry).
