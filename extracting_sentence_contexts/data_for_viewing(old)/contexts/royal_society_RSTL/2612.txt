views which are prevalent,â€”it is difficult to avoid suspecting the propriety of
opinions that have been thought to rest on the sure basis of correct obserya-
tion, or doubting the accuracy of analyses conducted by chemists of the highest
reputation. The era of brilliant discovery in chemistry appears to have termi-
nated for the present. The time is arrived for reviewing our stock of infor-
mation, and submitting the principal facts and fundamental doctrines of the
science to the severest scrutiny. The activity of chemists should now, I con-
ceive, be especially employed, not so much in searching for new compounds or
new elements, as in examining those already discovered ; in ascertaining with
the greatest possible care the exact ratio in which the elements of compounds
are united ; in correcting the erroneous statements to which inaccurate obser-
vation has given rise; and exposing the fallacy of opinions which partial ex-
perience or false facts have produced. Considerable as is the labour and dif-
ficulty of such researches, they will eventually prove of great importance to
chemical science by supplying correct materials for reasoning ; and will some-
times, even in the most familiar parts of analytical chemistry, lead to the de-

tection of errors that had escaped notice, and which vitiate many analyses pre-

viously regarded without suspicion. An instance of this kind I shall have

occasion to notice in the present communication.

The foregoing reflections haye been more immediately elicited by circum-
