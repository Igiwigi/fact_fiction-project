These equations are to be treated just as they were before the constants « were
introduced—the same elements remain undetermined as before, but at each stage the
quantities found presumably contain «”',

We see at once from equation (1) that the coefficient of a. in y, (the first element
being excepted) is simply y%. In fact, it can be shown step by step that the coefticient
of a» in ¥,4, (the first element always excepted) is exactly that part of y, which is
independent of a with 0, increased by 1; and therefore the coefficient of «” in Y,.1,
when the values of y,”... as far as they are known are substituted, is equal to that
part of the left-hand member of Y, which is independent of «”, 0,’ being increased by
unity.

Now Y;, is independent of a” and of 6, and vanishes, thus Y, is independent of a",
