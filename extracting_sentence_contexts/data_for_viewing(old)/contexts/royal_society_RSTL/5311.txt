62 MR. T. H. HUXLEY ON THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE CEPHALOUS MOLLUSCA.

The chambers of the venous appendages, then, in the Cephalopoda answer to a
* contractile sac,” in which the secreting power and the contractile faculty have
become restricted and localized in a portion of the organ#®.

I have here touched mainly upon the less commonly understood portions of the
internal anatomy of the Cephalopoda and Gasteropoda, but they clearly tend to
strengthen the conclusion to be derived from embryology and the more generally
known anatomical facts, viz. that the Cephalopoda and Gasteropoda are morphologi-
cally one, are modifications of the same archetypal molluscous form.

On the other hand, I have made no reference to the Acephala, nor is it my inten-
tion to go into that part of the subject ; but, for the sake of the zoological bearings
of the question, I may shortly express my belief, that of the two families of the
Acepbala, there is abundant evidence, both anatomical and embryological, to show
that the one, the LamellibranchiataF, is modelled upon the archetype of the Cephalous
Mollusca.

Such evidence as we possess with regard to the Brachiopoda, however, is purely
anatomical, and (though I am aware that a great weight of authority lies upon the
other side) yet Mr. Haxcock's opinion, that they are rather to be considered as allied
