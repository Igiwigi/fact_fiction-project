the interesting range 2 to 10 m., and take ¢ = 5 and ¢ = 10>! for over land, and ¢ — 80
and ¢ = 107! for over sea. We then evaluate D, from (6-16) and (6-20), and plot for

each case a curve of
D,+D,—20log,[ f(|7|)] against hA-§.

These curves will eventually all join up into the single curve for D, + D, where the
upgoing wave predominates. We thus get a single curve fanning out into a series of
curves as hA~§ approaches zero, as is shown in figs. 8 and 9, In using these curves we
have to remember to add on the value of 20 log,,[ /(| 7 |)] appropriate to the wave-length
and conditions we are considering, and to help in doing this the values to be added on
in this way are tabulated on the graph. In computing these curves p was assumed equal
to p, in all cases, but account was taken of the fact that it is not really justifiable to
assume that 2odc is >e, e.g. for A= 2m. and ¢ = 1073, ¢ = 5 and ode — 1-2. The
