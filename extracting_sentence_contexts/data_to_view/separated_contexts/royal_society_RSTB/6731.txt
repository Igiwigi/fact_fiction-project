Change of shape of the nucleus does not
involve mutual displacement of the chromosomes, for even at late prophase the
polarized arrangement of the previous telophase is preserved (compare upper nucleus
in figs. 1 and 4). From the point of view of spiral structure, the detailed views of middle prophase
(fig. 24, Plate 17) and late telophase (figs. 27, 28) are the most instructive, for in them
the spirals can be clearly perceived, even in sections of the ordinary kind. This is
certainly owing to the fact that the coils, at these stages, are less closely packed than
at metaphase and anaphase. Quantitative estimate of the number of coils is not
practicable at telophase, owing to the flattened state of the nucleus and to the impossi-
bility of determining where one chromosome ends and another begins. This difficulty
is not present at prophase, and at the stage shown in figs. 3 and 24 whole chromosomes
can be followed throughout their length with complete certainty.
