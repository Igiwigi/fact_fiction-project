CONDUCTIVITY OF SODIUM HYDROXIDE IN AQUEOUS SOLUTION. 293

On correcting the conductivities shown in Table XIII. for the changes of viscosity
shown above, a series of values was obtained for the intrinsic conductivity, and these
are shown in contrast with the values for the molecular conductivity in the last
column of the same table. A graphical comparison of the two series of constants is
given in Diagram [X. The values for the intrinsic conductivity show a remarkable
increase of conductivity in concentrated solutions which is entirely masked in the
specific and molecular conductivities. The minimum value occurs at about 8 per cent.
NaOH, and in a 50-per cent. solution the intrinsic conductivity is nearly half as
great again as in the most dilute solutions. This increase of conductivity we
attribute to the fact that sodium hydroxide is an autolyte, that is to say, an
electrolyte when fused, and may therefore be able in concentrated solutions to
conduct the current quite independently of the ionising properties of the
solvent.

Although it was obvious that the conductivity of concentrated aqueous salt
solutions might be in part autolytie, we had hitherto been able to obtain no direct
experimental evidence in support of this view. The case of sodium hydroxide is,
however, especially favourable for the observations of this property, since its high
solubility and low melting-point combine to produce in the concentrated solution a
condition approximating unusually closely to that of the fused salt. Thus the
minimum value in the intrinsic conductivity of zine sulphate, to which attention has
been called by SurHeRLAND (â€˜ Phil. Mag., 1902, VI., vol. 3, p. 171), is reached in a
