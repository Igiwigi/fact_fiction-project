This means a realization of a stochastic resonance. Figure 3 presents an example
of the manifestation of this effect in a numerical simulation. The equivalence of the stochastic pulsation of the mass and increasing the stiffness relative to
the averaged motion is a fact of not only principle but also practical significance. The knowledge
about the structure of the averaged equations shows a way to tune the operating frequency to
keep the system in resonance. This tuning can be provided even though the characteristics of the
stochastic excitation in this system are neither theoretically known nor directly measurable.
