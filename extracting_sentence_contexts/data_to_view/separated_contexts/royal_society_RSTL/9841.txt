Trans., Part ITI., 1881. 1028 DR, W. H. GASKELL ON THE RHYTHM OF THE HEART OF

that the protoplasm does not form the explosive snbstance directly, but that there are
intermediate stages corresponding to the zymogenic stage in the gland. According to
this view there would be in the cardiac muscle during its normal activity three pro-
cesses going on : the growth of the protoplasm with the aid of the raw material from
the nutritive fluid surrounding the muscle fibres ; the transformation of the protoplasm
into intermediate products, which are non-explosible, or at least explosible with diffi-
culty ; and the formation from these of eagily explosible material; in fact, a gradual
succession from stable to more and more unstable combinations, If, then, the formative
activity of the muscle be distributed over these three stages in the right proportion, it
follows that impulses passing to the musele at equal times must all cause contractions
of equal force, Tf, however, that activity be exclusively directed towards the forma-
tion of the muscle protoplasm or the intermediate non-explosible substances ib is con-
ceivable that no contractions shovld be able to take place, because no suitable material
was ready for the impulses to act upon, though as a.natural consequence of this greater
activity in the formation of the intermediate substances the ultimate effect would be
that the snbsequent contractions would be very much greater than before. On this
view, then, the force of the contraction at any time depends upon the relative rates
at which these three processes proceed. In this way I can imagine standstill to take place, and it is also quite conceivable
that in certain conditions of nutrition of the heart it may oceur more easily than in
others ; thus, as we have scen in the heart cut out and suspended, complete quiescence
may in s0me cases be easily obtained, in others not at all ; 80, also, in the heart through
which salb solution is flowing I have often obtained standstill upon stimulation of the
vagus, thus confirming Lupwic and LUcasNGER,* while in other cases I have only
obtained acceleration, thus confirming Scnrre.t

Again, if the whole heart or the ventricle alone be beating in the apparatus described
on page 1019, while alt solution is flowing through it, it will beat regularly and well
for a long time with the salt solution, and if while it is still beating, whether strongly
or weakly, blood solution be sent into it under the same conditions of pressure, &c., as
the alt solution, then it often happens that as s00n as the blood is een to reach the
heart or the ventricle the heart stops still in the relaxed condition, sometimnes for a
considerable length of time, and snbsequently begins again to beat with the improved
beats due to the blood solution.
