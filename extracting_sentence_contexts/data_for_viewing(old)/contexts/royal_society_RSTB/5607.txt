anterior nucleus of the fasciculus longitudinalis medialis in its fasciculus connection,
but not, however, in its relation to the tectum and tegmentum.

The ventral nucleus resembles no discrete nuclei in reptiles or birds. It is related
distinctly with the striatum by the strio-subthalamic system, and with the lateral
olfactory areas and certain amygdaloid nuclei via the ventral olfactory projection tract
and via the peduncle of the medulla. Possibly the ventral nucleus is a differentiation
of the dorsal portion of the hypothalamus, and might be so considered, if it were not
for the fact that it lies a little dorsal to the general region and upon the same level with
the lateral group.

Looking at the medial group, as opposed to the lateral, the connections of the medial
nuclei are similar to those of the lateral with the following exceptions: the lateral
nuclei are related to the olfactory projection tract of Casax, while the medial (i.e.,
the ventral) connect with the ventral projection tract; the lateral nuclei (7.Â¢., the
lateral proper) in part receive the accessory optic tract and the posterior commissure ;
and the medial nuclei (both dorsal and ventral) give origin to large descending tegmental
and peduncular pathways. The lateral nuclei foreshadow the mammalian development
of the subthalamic centres, and the medial recall the great importance which the
generalised pathways from this region play in the motor adjustment of lower vertebrates.
It is probable that the medial group in Platypus manifests a differentiation unusual
