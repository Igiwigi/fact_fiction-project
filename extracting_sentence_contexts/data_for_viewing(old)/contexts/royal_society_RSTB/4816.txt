THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN ESTHERID CRUSTACEAN. 419

that it is strictly homologous with the ventral ccelom of Peripatus. This is entirely in
agreement with the view that the maxillary gland of Crustacea is the homologue of the
excretory organs of Peripatus. Although this view is adopted here only with
certain reservations, it must be pointed out that, up to now, this interpretation of the
maxillary gland has rested chiefly on adult anatomical comparisons. â€˜The development
of the maxillary gland and its relation to the coelom has not before been thoroughly
worked out. From the work described here it is now seen that not only does this gland
show a structure similar to that of the segmental organ of Peripatus, but that its
development is also strictly comparable. The fact that in Estheria the connection
between the dorsal and ventral parts of the maxillary mesoderm persists longer than
it does in any segment of Peripatus may indicate a condition even more primitive than
that found in the latter form. ;

With regard to the relation between the maxillary glands and the antennal glands,
it can be safely stated that these two glands are usually taken as being homologous
structures. There are certain points, however, that indicate that possibly this is not
so, or, at least, that indicate that while the end sacs of both glands may be the remains
of coelomic cavities, the ducts may be of different origin, and hence not homologous.
Until the development of the antennal gland has been fully worked out, it is not possible
to settle this point with any degree of certainty.
