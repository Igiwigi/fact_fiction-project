or the tails of the endpoint distributions. One important quantity is the quenched variance of the
endpoint distributions

For polymer models with translation-invariant random potential, the disorder-averaged variance
is linear in ¢ [11,12], ie.

where C is some model dependent constant. This fact can also be understood through the ‘tilt
symmetry’. Let us consider the tilted partition function

additivity argument implies the existence of the limiting free energy
