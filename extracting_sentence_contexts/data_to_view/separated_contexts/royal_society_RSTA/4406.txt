There is also the potential for an energetic advantage in organisms that use anaerobic
carbon fixation pathways, such as the rTCA cycle. Under aerobic conditions, the Calvin cycle uses
7-9 ATPs per mole of pyruvate fixed, versus 1-5 ATPs in the rTCA cycle [89,90]. Several of the
sequences detected in this survey are deeply branched, which could be a reflection of the fact
that these genes have not been robustly examined in environmental samples or, alternatively, the
lineages detected in SLW may represent novel groups.

(e) Redox chemistry and thermodynamics : =

Thermodynamic modelling based on redox chemistry and Gibbs free-energy estimates provides : ‚Äù
a link between the aquatic chemistry of an ecosystem and the metabolic structure of the microbial ae
community present. The classical view in aquatic geochemistry is that the order of oxidants used :
in the remineralization of organic carbon follows a predictable sequence based on decreasing [4
free energy returns (i.e. the electron tower or thermodynamic ladder; [94]), which is paralleled DNS
by an ecological succession of organisms [95]. This view probably holds true in many marine [=
environments that contain a near-continuous excess of organic carbon raining down from the [3S
surface as a result of photosynthesis.
