When TOA is computed off-chip, we assumed that processing
speed is not limited by the TAC/TDC used but by intrinsic I/O speed. This is why the design
of Niclass et al. [65] is penalized in the table with respect to the two previous designs, as the
integrated TDCs are the bottleneck. In this design in fact, only one row can be operational at each
time, whereas each four columns share a TDC. Thus, the overall TDC bandwidth of 10MSs~!
must be divided by 4 times 128, to reach the reported value. In the design of Gersbach et al. [46], a bandwidth of 1 MS s-! in TCSPC mode can be achieved,
whereas a much higher count rate is possible, thanks to an on-pixel six-bit counter.
