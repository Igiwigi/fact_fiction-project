enhancements at around 4mHz. Instead, this is most likely due to these observations sampling
the quietest solar region in our sample. In fact, it was found that these two quiet datasets (i.e. D6 and D9) had smaller surface mean magnetic fluxes, by 1 — 3 orders of magnitude (averaged
over their entire FOVs; also, similar flux ratios at chromospheric heights), compared to the other
eight observational fields of view (table 2). Furthermore, the Dé and D9 datasets have the largest
oscillatory power compared to the other image sequences.
