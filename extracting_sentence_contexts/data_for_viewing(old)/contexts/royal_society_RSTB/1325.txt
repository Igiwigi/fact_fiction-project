In 1883, Munrer-Cuatmas and ScHLUMBERGER (25) communicated to
Académie des Sciences the fact that the phenomenon of dimorphism occurs also
several species of the Miliolide. Thus, in Biloculina depressa, v'Ors., there are t
forms (see wood-cut, p. 405): A, with a large central chamber 200-400 p in diame
and with an outside diameter of the shell of 2°10 millim.; and B, with a small cent
chamber 20 in diameter, and an outside diameter varying from 1°5 millim.
2°64 millim. The interesting fact was also brought forward, that in this group the:
is a very marked difference in the mode of growth of the two forms. While in ti
form A, the arrangement of the chambers following the central one is biloculine fro:
the first, in the form B the chambers. following the minute central chamber ai
arranged at first on the quinqueloculine plan, the biloculine arrangement not bein,
attained, in B. depressa, until the eleventh chamber is formed.

A similar dimorphism is stated to exist in the genera Dillina, Lacazina, Fabulari
Triloculina, Trillina, Quinqueloculina, Pentellina, Heterillina, and Alveolina amo
the Imperforata, and among the Perforata in the genera Nodosaria, Dentali
Siphogenerina, Rotalina, and Amphistegina.
