This example is given as typical of the structure of the alloys lying between the
eutectic alloy and a tin content of 20 per cent. In all these alloys the primary
crystals of lead appear as dendritic crystallites of the type shown in this figure,
appearing embedded in typically laminated eutectic. A special feature of these alloys
is the fact that the lead crystallites are surrounded by zones of pure tin, ze., of
eutectic whose lead constituent has coalesced with the lead of the crystallite. This
feature is of considerable importance, because it explains the manner in which the
sheaths of pure tin isolate the free lead of the crystallites from the lead constituent

of the eutectic.

diameters) containing 62Â°97 per cent. of tin.
