ledge of that world. The action of the immediate organs of the sensorial power, we
have seen, being thus excited by one vital part acting on another, and by its vital pro-
perties alone, all analogy with the operations of inanimate nature here disappears.

While the other functions of the living animal are the results of inanimate agents
acting on living parts or living parts on them, in the sensorial functions we see the
effects of vital parts acting on each other and that by their vital properties alone,
Hence the analogy between the former and the operations of inanimate nature, and,
with the exception just pointed out, the total loss of all such analogy in the latter.

Whenece is it possible to conceive that such analogy can arise except from the
operation of some of the agents of the inanimate world? When the phenomena of the
living animal are carefully compared with the preceding facts, it will be found that
in every instance, in which any analogy between its functions and the operations of
inanimate nature can be traced, the interference of such an agent may be detected.

WE have now considered individually the various powers of the more perfect living
animal. We have found in it, beside the mechanical powers which, it will be ad-
mitted on all hands, it evidently possesses in common with inanimate nature, four
distinct powers ; three of them vital powers, properly s0 called, that is, powers having
properties essentially different from those of the agents which operate in inanimate
nature, In the fourth alone we recognise one of those agents; for we find it can extst
in other textures than those to which it belongs in the living animal, and that we can
substitute for it one of the powers of inanimate nature without deranging the func-
tions of life, ;
