298 D. C. LLOYD ON THE CHOICE OF HOSTS AND

It is probable that the most profound change following the killing of a host and/or
its contained parasite stage is chemical, and the figures given in Table XVII seem
to indicate that the usual reaction of the parasite females to hosts containing a given
stage of the parasite can be duplicated by killing hosts containing an earlier stage of the
parasite. Thus hosts with early larvae, if killed by immersion in hot water, have an
attraction similar to that of normal live hosts containing advanced parasite larvae.
Whether one can infer a similarity in the nature of the hosts from such figures is very
doubtful. This is indeed highly improbable, for it is very difficult to imagine that a
host containing a dead advanced parasite larva is of similar chemical composition to
a host containing a live parasite pupa. But such hosts have in common the fact that
they are very unsuitable for the development of the parasite’s progeny. It is clear from
the present results that any possible advantage accruing from the absence of disturbing
movements on the part of the parasite larvae is wholly counteracted by other more
repellent characters possessed by the dead larvae. It seems impossible to assess the
importance of movements of the parasite larvae by the present methods; any effect
they may have is obscured by the change in the chemical composition of the host
after death.

This leads to the second suggestion that the quantity of host material is positively
correlated with the gradation in the oviposition response. The first point to be decided
is the exact nature of the so-called “host”? material. It has been shown that until the
onset of the fifth and final instar of the parasite the hibernating gipsy moth larva can
