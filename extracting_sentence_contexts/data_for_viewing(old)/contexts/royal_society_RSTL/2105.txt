believed, the cause of the appearance of metals from metallic
s0lutions. These valuable observations ought to have: ex-
plained distinctly the source- of the appearance of acid and
alkaline substances at the two-extremities of the pile, yet the
Paper was never translated into English; nor at all attended
to; and one of their facts was contradicted by the assertion
of, generally, a very accurate observer, Mr. CRvicKsHANK,
who in his early experiments mentioned that he had not been
able to decompose' muriate of lime in the circuit,

In 1805 various statements were made, both in Italy and
England, respecting the generation of muriatic acid and fixed
alkali from pure water. The fact was asserted by MM. Pac-
CH1ONI and PEELE, and denied by Dr. WoLLasTon, M. Biot,
and the Galvanic Society at Paris,* Mr. SyLvzsTER, who

Â» Some writers have very incorrectly referred the origin of these researches to
the observations of His1NGER and BERZELIVUS ; Annales de Chem. Vol. 51.1 Cap.
pag. 167; but these observations were never quoted by any writer of the day on
the pretended production of muriatic acid and alkali; and I was not acquainted
with them till after my fundamental experiments were finished; and, when in
drawing up an account of them, I looked back through the whole series of peri-
odical publications to find accounts of experiments bearing upon the same question,
and I believe I first directed the public attention to the yalue of those researches.
