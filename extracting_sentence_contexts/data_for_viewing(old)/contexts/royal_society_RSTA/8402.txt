the observations of the Ist, 2nd, etc., calibrations in the apparently most suitable pro-
visional positions. Next, the differences n, — 7”, %, — %, etc., between the individual
values 7, %, etc., and ”, the mean of them all, are inserted. Underneath are » times
these differences, 7.¢., m (n, — 7), ete. The horizontal summation of these two rows gives
the numerical values to insert on the right-hand side of the determinant.

Passing to the solution of the latter (‘Table XIII) it will be seen that the equations Nx
and N& derived from the Nth calibration always have large coefficients for the two
unknowns Ay and Bx, while the values of the remainder of the coefficients approximate to
fixed quantities for the A’s and B’s respectively. Advantage is taken of this to obtain
a solution by successive approximations. The first step, given on the right of the
initial determinant, consists in the elimination of each By between each pair of equations
Na and Ng. On account of the fact that one such pair of equations is redundant (see
Section I E), equations 6x and 68 are omitted. Since the B’s are only of the order of
1/30 of the A’s, the coefficients of B,, B,, etc., have all been divided by 100, so that the
unknowns are 100 B,, 100 B,, ete. In order to see what terms are negligible com-
pared with others, it is only necessary to multiply the coefficients of 100 B,, ete., by 3
and to compare these figures with the coefficients of A,, etc.

It is clear that the first step has reduced the equations to a form in which the B terms
are quite small in comparison with the A terms. To obtain a first approximation to the
A’s, the former are neglected pro tem. and the equations solved in the straightforward
way, introducing at the correct stage the equation of condition,
