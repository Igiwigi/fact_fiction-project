In this problem the discs are circular electrodes fixed to two infinite
conducting planes, which are themselves connected together by the earth or by a wire at
infinity. If the axis of z is that of the two co-axial discs, and perpendicular to the infinite
plane conducting sheets, the electrical potential V satisfies LAPLACE’s equation at all
points between the plates, and the further conditions

where A is a constant, 2a is the distance between the plates, bisected by the origin,
e, is the radius of either disc, and ¢ is the distance of any point from the axis of z. In
fact (z, 9) are the two cylindrical polar co-ordinates on which V can alone depend. By pre-supposing the existence of a form for V of the type

clearly satisfying Laptacr’s equation when z is between +a, RreMANN was able to
determine ¢ and & in such a way as to make the derivate dV/dz take the prescribed
values all over the plane z =a, and thus automatically over z= —a also. For the
Bessel-Fourier theorem gives at once an integral of the form
