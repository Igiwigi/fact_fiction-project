From these experiments, as well as many others of a similar kind which it
is unnecessary to detail, it appears fair to presume, that in ayailing ourselyes of the
reducing agency of feeble currents, or at least of those elicited by a single pair of
plates, it is necessary that the positive electrode should be composed of a readily
oxidizable metal: thus using a kind of battery of wo cells, in which the wires form-
ing the electrodes, and the fluid submitted to experiment, form the contents of the
second cell.

7. But few metallic s0lutions yield s0 readily as those of lead to the reducing agency
of weak currents; and where a longer time and continuance of action is required to
effect the reduction, the decomposing apparatus of M. BecquerEL will be found a
usefu] addition to the little battery (4.), with the substitution of a plug of plaster of
Paris for one of clay. This piece of apparatus is, in fact, a counterpart of the battery
itself, consisting, like it, of two glass cylinders, one within the other, the smaller one
having a bottom or floor of plaster of Paris fixed into it: this smaller tabe may be
about half an inch wide and three inches in length, and is intended to hold the me-
tallic 8olution submitted to experiment, the external tube in which it is immersed
being filled with a weak solution of common salt *, Into the latter solution a slip of
amalgamated zine, (for the poxitive electrode,) soldered to the wire coming from the
copper plate of the battery (4.), is immersed, whilst for the negative electrode a slip
of platina foil, fixed to the wire from the zine plate of the battery, passes through a
