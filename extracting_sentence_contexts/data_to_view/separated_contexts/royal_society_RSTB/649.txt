In the case of the Skate genus, the pro-
bability is that the smaller species (¢.g., R. radiata or R. circularis) found in our
waters more closely resemble the ancestral forms than the large FR. batis or R. alba. In other words, it is more likely that the Skates have sprung from small generalized
Selachians than from extinct forms as large, e.g., as Lemargus, which implies that
R. batis, and other still larger species, do not owe their great size to the fact that
they are large Sharks flattened out, but rather that they are Skate whose ancestors
have continued to produce large varieties, which have best succeeded in the struggle
for existence. If this is the case, if the ancestors of the Skates were comparatively
small forms, it will, it appears to me, be impossible to account for the existence of the
electric organ by looking upon it as a vestige of a large useful ancestral structure—a
view which neither seems to be warranted by the developmental history nor the
behaviour after development. From an embryological standpoint, P. radiata appears »
to be in various aspects more Shark-like than either 2. batis or R. clavata.t Further,
according to the observations of Howes, recently communicated to the Zoological
Society,} A. radiata is, in structural points, more primitive than other Skate.
