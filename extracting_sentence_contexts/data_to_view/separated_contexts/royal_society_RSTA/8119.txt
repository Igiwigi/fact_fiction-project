A number of functions were tried,—among them the linear function which is the
actual form of U in the problem of this paper. Rayteicn’s conclusion was that the
steady motion is stable or unstable (for a fluid of vanishing viscosity) according as U,
regarded as a function of y, has a curvature which is or is not of one sign throughout the
breadth of the field. In the nature of the case, no question of a critical speed (or value
of ReyNoLps’ number) arises.

* Equation (1) with the term in y suppressed may in fact be regarded as expressing the constancy of €
for a particular element of the fluid.
