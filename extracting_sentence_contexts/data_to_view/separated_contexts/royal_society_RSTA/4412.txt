Schroder’s staircases used in the experiments reported in [29].

call here inconsistent connectedness (or violations of marginal selectivity), and it should not be
confused with the meaning of contextuality as defined in §§1 and 2 and indicated by the sign
of AC.

4. Schréder’s staircase illusion (a cyclic system of rank 3)

Asano et al. [29] studied a cyclic system of rank 3, using as ‘objects’ q1, 42,43 Schréder’s staircases
tilted at three different angles, @ = 40°, 45°,50°, as shown in figure 1. In fact, these three angles
formed the middle part of a set of 11 angles ranging from 0° to 90° and presented either in the
descending order (context c,), or in the ascending order (context cz), or else in a random order
(context cz). Each context involved a separate set of about 50 participants, and each participant
in response to each of 11 angles had to indicate whether she/he sees the surface A in front of
B (+1) or B in front of A (—1). From these 11 responses, in each context, the authors selected
two.
