arrangement prevails in young specimens.

Each wing is provided on the outer side with numerons excessively fine parallel
ridges, whose structure will be described presently ; these ridges follow every curve
and inequality of the snrface, so that their sections present various appearances.

The consequence of this arrangement is that those parts of the wings which are
turned back or folded show only the layer of medullary fibres, and are therefore white,
while the parts which are not reflected, snch as the posterior wing and the upper part of
the dorsal wing, show the minute ridges which give these portions a pinkish colour in
the fresh state, and cause the minute striations which gave occasion to the comparison
with the convolutions of the cerebrum of Mammalia ; we shall see presently that they
have nothing to do with these conyolutions, but that in fact, they belong to quite
another part of the brain.

I have not given figures of the external aspect of the brain of the Mormyride,
because MAROUSEN's? illustrations are very good, although his drawings of the 8ections
and of the microscopic anatomy leave much to be desired.
