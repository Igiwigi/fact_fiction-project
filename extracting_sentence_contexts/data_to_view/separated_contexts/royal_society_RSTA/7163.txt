The next series to this, which has infra-red-active frequencies only in the odd-numbered
n-paraffins, has been assigned to a nearly constant frequency near 1175 cm~!. The polariza-
tion data for n-nonane and n-nonadecane show that these absorption bands arise from
perpendicular vibrations, as expected for CH, twisting modes. In general, the CH,
twisting modes give rise to weaker bands than the wagging modes, a fact also corroborated
by observations of the n-alkyl and polymethylene halides (Brown & Sheppard 1953,
unpublished work). It should be noted that the limits chosen earlier in this section rely on the correct
identification of the series in the early members of the n-paraffins, and that, if these
correlations are not accepted, other schemes are possible. A number of such schemes have
been tried, but they all gave patterns which were either irregular or did not conform with
the infra-red measurements on oriented crystals.
