explanations* may satisfy some of the conditions in particular cases, but none of them
atisfy all, whereas I think it will be found that the submergence hypothesis not
only meets the requirements of each particular case, but that it also shows them
all to be concordant, and such as would pertain to one common and general cause.
Another important conclusion hinges upon this question. I have beforet pointed
out the bearing that the position of the Rubble-drift should have in limiting our
estimate of the time elapsed since the close of the Glacial period. In a paper already
eferred to I had shown cause why that time was not to be measured by Dr. Croxt’s
eckoning of 80,000 years, as not being supported by the facts of geology. The
position and character of the Rubble-drift show that the transition from the
so-called Post-glacial beds to the recent Alluvial deposits is very abrupt, and that
there is an absence of sedimentation or of anything indicative of lapse of time
etween those two series. This conclusion is confirmed by the sections of the Belgian
caves. There, as we have seen (ante, pp. 927, 928), the Quaternary cave deposits are
separated by only a few feet of Rubble-drift from deposits of the stone or Neolithic
ge. Nowhere are there any intervening sedimentary beds, or any deposits requiring
Hength of time for their accumulation—the only subsequent work requiring time being
comprised in the alluvial accumulation of our great rivers.
Besides, on Crouu’s hypothesis, Man must have remained comparatively stationary
during a vastly long period. But how does this accord with the facts. Take
the earliest works of Man with which we are acquainted—the rude implements
