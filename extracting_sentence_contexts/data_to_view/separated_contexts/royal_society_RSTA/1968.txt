The
different a posteriori corrections proposed in the literature to account for this error will be derived
in the next subsection.

(b) Correction of third-order diagonal components of EDF

Given that the EDF of equation (2.20) is equivalent to the fourth-order Hermite-expanded
EDF, only the Hermite expansion-based EDFs will be considered for the theoretical analysis of
this subsection. A simple CE analysis shows that at the NS level, to match the viscous (non-
equilibrium) stress tensor for the continuous Boltzmann equation, moments of orders two and
three of the EDF must be exactly recovered. Integrating in phase space, the following continuous
second- and third-order moments are in fact recovered [42]:

FIND = puri tig + 0C%5i, in” (2.21a)

and
TINS, = Puli, Mili, + Ce [11,5i,2” Ley , (2.21b)

while one gets the following moments with the second- and third-order discrete EDFs:

I) = puri tig + p25, 0 (2.22a)

and
WD? = oe (ui, Sixisleye? (2.22b)

and
Oo ») = pitty + 1035), 10" (2.23a)

and
OF = PCB ins [irdizisleye +P (1 Siiais) (MisMittis +02 [144 55" Jeyehs (2.23)

The discrete EDF of equation (2.20) recovers the same second- and third-order moments as the
third-order Hermite expansion. To further illustrate the errors in the moments of the discrete
EDFs, they are plotted in figure 1 as a function of the non-dimensional temperature. Given the
focus of the present manuscript on thermal effects, the velocity-dependence of these errors is not
shown here.
