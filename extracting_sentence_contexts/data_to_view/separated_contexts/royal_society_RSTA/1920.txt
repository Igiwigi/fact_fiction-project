In a stratified environment, however, the volume flux Q(z) closely follows equation (1.10) in
the region below the neutral buoyancy height, and so equation (1.10) provides an approximation
for evaluating dQ/dz in the integral equation (1.7). This leads to the approximate result

aa gNH, (1.11)

in which H is the maximum height reached by the plume (see equation (1.3)). Full numerical
solution in fact leads to the value
8, =0.58N7H. (1.12)

We deduce that the average buoyancy of the entrained fluid is approximately equivalent to that
of the ambient fluid at a height 0.58 H above the source in a stratified layer. As a result, we expect
that in the event that all particles sediment from the intrusion, the buoyancy of the intruding fluid
will be

Qo 2
Shin = Sh On + 0.58N7H, (1.13)

where g7, corresponds to the buoyancy of the source fluid relative to that of the ambient fluid at the
level of the source, Qo is the source volume flux and Qy is the volume flux at the top of the plume. In this paper, we consider descending plumes (which relate to deep-sea mining operations) in
which the particles add to the total buoyancy of the plume, and also ascending plumes (with
relevance to volcanic eruptions) in which the particles reduce the effective buoyancy of the plume.
