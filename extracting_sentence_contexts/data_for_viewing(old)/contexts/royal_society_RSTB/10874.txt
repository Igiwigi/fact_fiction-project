severely. A rapid rise in cases over the summer of 2014 was
followed by a fall in cases towards the end of August 2014,
and control by the end of October. The behaviour of the epi-
demic in Lofa mirrors what has been observed across many
regions of West Africa, and a better understanding of this
behaviour can yield important lessons for investigating the
epidemic elsewhere. Here, we analysed the impact of differ-
ent clinical and community-based interventions that were
put in place at different times, in an attempt to pinpoint
what exactly turned the epidemic around.

The main clinical intervention was the expansion of the
ETC in Foya from a capacity of 10 (although in fact used for
up to 40 patients during periods of overcrowding) to 100. We
have estimated that the provision of isolation enabled through
the expanded ETC reduced the reproduction number of those
who entered the ETC by about two-thirds and thus made a
strong contribution to the substantial decline in case numbers
observed in the three weeks following the opening of the
expanded ETC. Without the expansion, the outbreak would
have continued to grow for weeks longer, and we estimated
that hundreds of lives were potentially saved by this measure.

The national government imposed a state of emergency in
