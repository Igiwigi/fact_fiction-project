The best evidence about
the course of a decline is given by Green & Evans (1940). Their study began at the end of
a period of increase, maximum numbers being found in the 1933 estimates of spring
abundance. On 1 square mile of the area, however, the peak year was 1935, and it is
possible that spring densities of population during 1933-5 were, in fact, rather similar
over the rest of the 5 square miles. Whatever the truth of this it is certain that at least
between 1935 and 1938 there was a rapid and continuous decline; also that this was
largely because of an annually increasing death-rate among the young. We must therefore account for the fact that although abundance (and presumably
competition) was much reduced, yet the population continued to decline for at least three
and possibly five consecutive years.
