with nitrogen, when the small negative or the large positive ball was rendered in-
ductric, the effects corresponded with those which in oxygen were produced when
the small poxitive or the large negative was rendered inductric.

1688. In such solid bodies as glass, lac, sulphur, &c., the particles appear to be able
to polarize in all directions, for a mass when experimented upon $0 as to ascertain
its inductive capacity in three or more directions (1690.), gives no indication of a dif-
ference, Now as the particles are fixed in the mass, and as the direction of the in-
duction through them must change with its change relative to the mass, the constant
effect indicates that they can polarize electrically in any direction. This accords
with the view already taken of each particle as a whole being a conductor (1669.);
and, as an experimental fact, helps to confirm that view.

1689. But though particles may thus polarize in any direction under the influence
of powers which are probably of extreme energy (1686.), it does not follow that each
particle may not tend to polarize to a greater degree, or with more facility, in one
direction than another ; or that different kinds may not have specific differences in
this respect, as they have differences of conducting and other powers (1296. 1326.
1395.). T songht with great anxiety for a relation of this nature; and selecting cry-
stalline bodies as those in which all the particles are symmetrically placed, and there-
fore best fitted to indicate any result which might depend upon variation of the di-
rection of the forces to the direction of the particles in which they were developed,
experimented very carefully with them. I was the more strongly stimulated to this
inquiry by the beautiful electrical condition of those crystalline bodies tourmaline and
