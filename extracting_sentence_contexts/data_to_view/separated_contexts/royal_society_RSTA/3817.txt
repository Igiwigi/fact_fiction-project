The dynamic tensile strength
was calculated analytically using the information recorded in the strain gauges. Results show very
uniform values for almost all of the specimens which reached tensile resistances up to 15 MPa
depending on the strain rate. Although this was not a fact considered in this work, it is important
to give a relationship with the strain rate, as it influences significantly the values of dynamic
tensile strength reached. In this way, the aim was to have a constant projectile velocity and so a
constant strain rate at the moment of fracture, but controlling this magnitude was not an easy task
as it depended on different parameters such as gas pressure and friction between Teflon discs on
the projectile and inner part of the cannon. Even if gas pressure was adjusted to a constant value,
the existing friction changed in each test due to the wear of Teflon modifying the velocities that
reached at the exit of the cannon.
