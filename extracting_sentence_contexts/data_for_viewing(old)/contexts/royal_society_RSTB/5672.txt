This family includes the largest proportion of biochemically interesting genera and
species of any investigated in this paper, and if a renewal of the collection of carbon
balance sheets is contemplated, it-seems advisable to collect a number of species of this
family, and of the specified genera, for investigation.

It is evident from the above facts that the biochemically interesting fungi
are by no means confined to the commoner genera and species—such as species of
Aspergillus and Penicillium—but that investigation of some of the rarer species, many
of which grow well on purely synthetic media, is bound to lead to results of interest
and to the isolation of interesting, and possibly new, types of metabolic products.

Summary.

Carbon balance sheets are given for a wide variety of species of fungi belonging
to different orders, families and genera. A number of these species are evidently of
biochemical interest and should be further investigated. These are dealt with in some
detail in the discussion of results obtained.
