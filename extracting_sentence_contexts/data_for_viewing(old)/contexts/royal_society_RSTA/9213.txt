As supporting the theory of displaced links, the mesh at 26000 (¢ 12 and No. 4) is
interesting. For the link 17256 is easily explained by the displacement in @
disappearing, and the link 17250 by its continuance to the line 22813. In fact the
sum of the two links is 2e—'24. From 26000 the link 14929 is not entered as it
is so small, but there are other examples of this small » in this map and the v
link appears to be a normal associate with an e mesh.

Starting from §, there are four separations close to 17264 or e(—d,). The link
4611°32 is too much out to be introduced on its own account, but it forms part of a
mesh whose corresponding link is evidently c. It is taken as ¢(—d,) = 4610°52. A
displacement somewhere in 42644 producing 3°51 not only makes the long link e
correct, but with the disappearance of the —d, displacement on the preceding ¢ at the
same time makes the separation to 26698 a correct ~ link, The alternative formula
(No. 15) is on the supposition that the displacement is produced in the ¢ by 26,.
Perhaps we should stop at 33345 as the next link 14929, like the one referred to
