But here a very real distinction enters between
the compressible and the incompressible mass. In the incompressible mass vibrations
of order Â» = 1 are non-existent, the displacement being purely a rigid body displace-
ment; in the compressible mass vibrations of order n = 1 can certainly occur, and so
might reasonably be expected to be the first to become unstable. It is in point of fact known that the incompressible mass becomes unstable through
vibrations of orders 2, 3, ... in turn; it is found that the compressible mass also
becomes unstable through vibrations of orders 2, 3, ... in turn, the vibrations of
order 1 failing completely to produce instability. The reason for this apparent
anomaly can, I think, be traced in the following way. Ina displacement of order 1
any spherical layer of particles will after displacement be spread uniformly over
another sphere excentric to the first.
