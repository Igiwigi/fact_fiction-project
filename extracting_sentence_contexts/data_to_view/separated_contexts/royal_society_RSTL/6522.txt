Now there is od ambiguity
whatever in this latter expression. © Fracture” means the breaking and splitting of the
ice regarded as a brittle and crystalline s0lid, and could never be intendes to have the
slightest reference to viscosity. In fact the expression is altogether inapplicable to any
body which can be called viscous, without what I should regard 858 violation of scien-
titic language. Still this, it may be 8aid, may be onlya want of striot accuracy of expres-
Sion, rather than of accuracy of conception. But if a notion of cracking and breaking, 80
foreign to any idea of plasticity, should be admitted, it could not be said that a glacier
moved as it is observed to move because it was plastic, but merely that it moved as if
it were plastic.
