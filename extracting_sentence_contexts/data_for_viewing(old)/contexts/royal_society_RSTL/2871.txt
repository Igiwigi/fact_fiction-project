mechanical cohesion. It seems to follow as a consequence from such a structure that
their density must increase from their circumference towards their centre. Now it is
worthy of remark, that Sir Davip Baewsrer has discovered very similar phenomena
by polarized light in the crystalline lenses of certain fishes, which are known by direct
experiment to increase in density towards the centre. Indeed the figure which he has
given of the lens of the codfish in the Philosophical Transactions for 1816 (Plate Ãž,4 f X
fig. 1.) is 80 like the appearance of one of the crystals which I have described, that it
might be supposed to have been intended for a representation of it.


MR. TALBOT ON THE OPTICAL PHENOMENA OF CERTAIN CRYSTALS. 27

Having pointed out this resemblance, I may also mention another class of facts to
which I think those I have described possess a considerable analogy. I mean the
optical figures which BrewsreR has discovered in spheres of glass whose density was
rendered variable by heating them.

He says* that, * if we take a cold sphere of glass and immerse it in a trough of
hot oil, placed in a polarizing apparatus, we ball observe @ black cross with four
sectors of polarized light. If the sphere is turned round it will exhibit in every posi-
tion the very same figure. If we now suppose the trough to be filled with such
spheres they will exhibit the same phenomena in whatever direction the polarized
light is transmitted through them, and eyen if they were in a state of motion. A
fluid composed of such spherical particles would exhibit the same polarizing struc-
ture in every possible direction, and even if it were in a rapid state of gyration. If
