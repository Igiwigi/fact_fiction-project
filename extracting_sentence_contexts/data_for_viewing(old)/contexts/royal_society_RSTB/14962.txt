Moynihan in a universal fashion are, de facto, inaccurate. Never-
theless, we assessed citations of this type separately, in two
regards: 1. Does Moynihan provide any empirical evidence,
even if not universally true, that fits the attribution? 2. Does Moy-
nihan contain any ideas/hypotheses that fit the attribution? In
each of these cases, we classified the support that Moynihan pro-
vides using the same three-point scale used above, i.e. supports,
partially supports and does not support.

It is important to point out, however, that we have taken a
generous view of support for attribution in the case of ‘research
finding’ and ‘fact about nature’ categories: we have counted an
attribution in a text segment as being fully supported when it
contained information that Moynihan only stated was supported
by the study, without actually providing any evidence. For
example, we assessed text segments that said that nuclear species
have an effect on flock formation as fully supported because
Moynihan stated that some identified nuclear species have a
role in flock formation, even though the role wasn’t empirically
demonstrated.

While assessing text segments for their attribution of Moynihan,
we noticed that segments in the partially or not supported cat-
