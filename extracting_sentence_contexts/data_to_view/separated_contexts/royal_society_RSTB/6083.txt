On the whole, too, it would appear that the
labyrinths of some frogs are inherently more lethargic under gravity test than those
of others. One clear conclusion is that the utricular otoliths are not set, as one might, for
example, set a piece of mechanical apparatus, to respond at particular fixed angles
of inclination. This fact may be illustrated in another way. We sometimes used
the following method of measurement. The frog is tilted first, say, to its right, until
a response occurs ; then in the leftward direction, until a reaction of an opposite
kind is registered.
