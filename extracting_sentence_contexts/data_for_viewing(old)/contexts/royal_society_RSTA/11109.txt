292 MR. G. UDNY YULE ON THE ASSOCIATION

to note that apparently, from Mr. Garron’s figures, there is a negative correlation
between the artistic character of parentage and fertility ; thus :—

When both parents are artistic, number of children to fraternity is 4°93
», one parent is » ” ” » 5°15
» neither ,, % » 9 9 5°28

This would not, however, affect the association between artistic faculty of parentage
and offspring, as increasing or decreasing the frequencies 296 and 372 in any con-
stant ratio would not alter the ratio of the cross-products. The interest lies in the
fact that artistic faculty is apparently a heritable attribute associated (negatively)
with fertility, and hence (as Professor PEARSON has pointed out) would tend to dis-
appear in the absence of opposing causes.

§ 48. Assortative Mating according to Stature.—I give this example as an instance
of the fact that the association between attributes depends very largely, in some
cases, on what I have called the choice of axes, 7.e., the strictness of definition of the
attribute. The following are the data giving the number of observed cases in which
a tall, medium, or short husband was mated with a tall, medium, or short wife
(“ Natural Inheritance,” p. 206).
