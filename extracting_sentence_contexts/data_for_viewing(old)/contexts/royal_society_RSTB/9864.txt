the best-studied of all the primitively eusocial wasps. Thanks to
its remarkable social biology, combined with the accessibility of
its nesting sites, Polistes dominula now offers an extraordinary
depth of insight into the evolutionary drivers of behaviour in
eusocial groups where helpers truly have an option to breed
alone. The picture that emerges is one of a eusocial insect society
that has more in common with cooperatively breeding ver-
tebrate groups, in which the presence of non-relatives is
widespread [38,39], than had previously been conceived. Like
their vertebrate counterparts [39], cofoundress associations are
shaped and maintained by both direct and indirect fitness com-
ponents. Unrelated helpers are therefore more likely to be
symptom of the fact that direct fitness benefits can maintain
cooperation [38] than just a maladaptive by-product of kin rec-
ognition errors. Moreover, such direct fitness benefits may well


have played a role in precluding the evolution of a committed cofoundress associations. The work discussed above has con- 5 |
