Nonetheless, the SDN is three to five times larger
in males than females, and many years later, we know this is
because the majority of neurons in this small region die in
females very early in life because they are deprived of the oes-
tradiol that the male generates locally in the brain by
aromatizing his testicularly derived androgens [22]. There are
probably more publications about the SDN than neurons actu-
ally in the SDN, yet its role in any functional difference


between males and females remains elusive, a point further
elaborated on below.

5. Sex differences in the human brain: fact

or fiction? The SDN did serve the important purpose of kickstarting the
search for sex differences in the mammalian brain. A prolifer-
ation of ‘volumetric sex differences’ followed, in which either
an area, nucleus, cell layer or fibre track was found to be
bigger in one sex.
