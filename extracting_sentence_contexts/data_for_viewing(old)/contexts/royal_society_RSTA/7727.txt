not sufficiently advanced to make an attempt at a detailed analysis worth while
at present. Other maxima given by Menrzt are at about 304 for NaCl and for
KI; now both these maxima lie above the harmonic of the main vibration ; it is

possible to explain these maxima only if the higher order terms in the energy are
taken into account: A quantitative discussion is hardly feasible at present in view
of the small number of these maxima recorded.

c—Absorption in the Far Infra-Red—We shall confine ourselves mainly to the question
of the difference tones. As outlined above, it seems that as long as the frequency
branches are separate, we have a lower limit to the difference vibrations and hence
after a certain point the absorption should go to zero. Of course, the terms of higher
order will again modify this conclusion, as will the fact that combination between
similar branches is allowed ; but it seems justifiable to expect an appreciable drop

on the absorption after a certain value of the frequency. At present the systematic
measurements of CzerNy and his school have reached 300» but no further, and
the other measurements at isolated points are too few to allow definite conclusions
