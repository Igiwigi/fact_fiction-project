ON THE EVOLUTION OF THE MAMMALIAN PALATE 325

admit a common mesenchyme condensation. The separate existence of the bones in
the adult is very easy to understand. At the 28 and 122 mm. stages described by
de Beer and Fell, the premaxillae are well ossified, meeting in a strong symphysis
which bears the “os carunculae” and egg tooth. In the adult animal the symphyseal
region has been resorbed, and the isolation of the palatine processes would follow
directly. The frequent existence of separate ossification centres in the palatal processes
of the premaxillary of mammals is not, in itself, good evidence that these parts
represent once separate elements; in the pig (as summarized by de Beer 1937, p. 336)
the maxilla ossifies from no less than five separate centres including two in its palatine
process. In point of fact fragmentation of dermal bones is rare and the assumption
that it occurs in Ornithorhynchus must be based largely on the relative simplicity of
the resulting interpretation, set against the difficulties which arise if it is denied.
There is some precedent to be found in the parietals of man which, unlike those of other
mammals, ossify from two pairs of centres which occasionally fail to fuse in the adult.

So far evidence about which there is important difference of opinion has been
avoided or discarded, but there is one set of observations which takes on a new
importance at this stage. A slender splint of membrane bone, lying well behind the
vomer and closely applied to the basisphenoid, has been recorded by Parker (1885,
plate 37, figures 6, 8; plate 38, figure 7; plate 39, figure 8; see also p. 260) in Galeo-
pithecus “ phillipensis”, and its presence has been confirmed by van Kampen (1922,
p. 54). Both authors regard the bone as a parasphenoid. Fuchs (1910, p. 48, figure 14)
