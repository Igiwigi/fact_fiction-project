Casax (10) at first described the cells of the enteric plexuses as being all of one type, but
later (11) described, in his ‘ Histologie du Systéme Nerveux,’ cells of two types, similar
to those of Docter’s Types I and IT, although he does not accept Docie1’s interpretation
of their significance. He believes that the processes of the cells of Docirt’s Type II
are all similar (axonic), and that accordingly the cells cannot subserve a sensory function.
He describes both types as occurring in the myenteric plexus, but in the sub-mucous
plexus, he maintains that the cells are all of Docre1’s type II with long processes. His
view has received corroboration in the work of L. R. MtLiEr (52), who states that the
cells forming the sub-mucous plexus possess dendrites similar in form to the axone.
In the myenteric plexus, MULLER describes two types of cells distinct from those forming
the sub-mucous plexus. Both these types of cells possess short dendrites which end
either on the neurones in the ganglion of origin or in club-like expansions on the muscle
fibres. From these facts, MtLirr suggests that the intrinsic fibres forming the fibre-
tracts in the myenteric plexus are axonic, whereas in the sub-mucous plexus they are
chiefly dendritic.

Err Miuier (51) also supported the view that the neurones of the myenteric and
sub-mucous plexuses conform to two morphological types and described cells similar
to two of the types of Doaren. He believed that cells of Type I are vagal in origin,
those of Type IT (and in this category he included the “ interstitial cells of CasaL”’),
sympathetic. He did not, however, accept Docret’s interpretation of the functional
relationships of the neurones of these types, and believed that there exists in the gut-wall
a primitive type of nerve-net.

But the view that the enteric ganglia are made up of cells of two types is not uniformly
