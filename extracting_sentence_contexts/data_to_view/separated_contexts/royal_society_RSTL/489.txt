Now, in order that such an undulation may continue its pro-
gress to any considerable distance, there must be in each part
of it, a tendency to preserve its own motion in a right line from

the centre ; for, if the excess of force at any part were commu-
__nicated to the neighbouring particles, there can be no reason
why it should not very s0on be equalised throughout, or, in
other words, become wholly extinct, since the motions in con-
trary directions would naturally destroy each other. The
origin of sound from the vibration of a chord is evidently of
this nature; on the contrary, in a circular wave of water, every
part is at the same instant either elevated or depressed. It may
be difficult to show mathematically, the mode in which this
inequality of force is preserved ; but the inference from the
matter of fact, appears to be unavoidable ; and, while the science
of hydrodynamics is 80 imperfect that we cannot even solve the
Simple problem of the time required to empty a vessel by a
given aperture, it cannot be expected that we should be able to
account perfectly for 80 complicated a series of phenomena, as
those of elastic fluids. The theory of HuyGEexs indeed explains
the circumstance in a manner tolerably satisfactory : he Sup-
poses every particle of the medium to propagate a distinct un-
dulation in all directions; and that the general effect is only
perceptible where a portion of each undulation conspires in
direction at the same instant ; and it is easy to show that suech a
general undulation would in all cases proceed rectilinearly, with
proportionate force; but, upon this supposition, it seems to
follow, that a greater quantity of force must be lost by the
divergence-of the partial undulations, than appears to be con-
sistent with the propagation of the effect to any considerable
distance. Yet it is obvious, that some such limitation of the
motion must naturally be expected to take place; for, if the
intensity of the motion of any particular part, instead of conti-
nuing to be propagated straight forwards, were supposed to
affect the intensity of a neighbouring part of the undulation, an

impulse must then have travelled from an internal to an exter-
nal circle in an oblique direction, in the same time as in the
direction of the radius, and consequently with a greater velo-
city; against the first proposition.
