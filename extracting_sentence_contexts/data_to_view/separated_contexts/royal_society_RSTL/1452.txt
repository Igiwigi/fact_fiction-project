When we have been long out of the habit of combining our
muscles in almost any one action of life, as walking, dan-
cing, or playing upon a musical instrument, we in a great
measure lose the combination, and find a difficulty in recover-
ing it, in proportion to the length of time we had been de-
prived of it; but the individual action of each muscle remains
as before. Thus, probably, with the muscles of the eye. A
variety of facts of a similar nature must present themselves to
every person conversant in the science of optics, which may
admit of a similar explanation. I have thus endeavoured, first, to point out the limited action
of the iris, and of consequence the insufficiency of this action
for explaining vision. Secondly, to prove that the lens
possesses no power of changing its form to the different dis-
tances of objects.
