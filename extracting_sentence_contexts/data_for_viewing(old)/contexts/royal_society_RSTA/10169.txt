BoDENSTEN’s Haperiments.

In the year 1899 M. BopEnsrext published the results of experiments on the non-
explosive combination of electrolytic gas during its passaye through a glazed porcelain
tube heated in a lead bath to various temperatures between 482° and 689°. The
author was himself conscious of certain inherent sources of error in his experimental
method, which influenced the results quite irregularly and often in a very annoying
manner (‘in oft recht unliebsamer Weise”). In view of this admission it is difficult
to say what is the precise significance of his work. Whilst fully recognising that he
was dealing with a surface phenomenon entirely, BopENsTerN concluded that it is
impossible to deduce any mathematical expression for his results other than the
equation for a reaction of the third order. ‘This, of course, means that, notwith-
standing the fact that the reaction was entirely confined to the layer of gas
immediately in contact with the walls of the reaction vessel, its velocity was governed
by its “order” in accordance with the law of mass action. We shall, however, have
no difficulty in proving that this conclusion is wrong.

* «Zeit. Phys. Chem.,’ 1904, vol. 47, p. 52. In applying the theory to the special case of catalytic gas
reactions, NERNST remarks, “Da diese Reaktionen wohl ausschliesslich an der Grenafliiche des Katalysators
abspielen, so wird die Geschwindigkeit keineswegs durch den Mechanismus der betreffenden Reaktion,
sondern wenn, was allerdings von vornherein nicht sicher ist, der Katalysator wiihrend des Reaktions-
verlaufes konstante Beschaffenheit behilt und zugleich mit praktisch unendlicher Geschwindigkeit die
hetreffenden Substanzen an der Grenzfliche zur Reaktion bringt, auch hier lediglich durch die Diffusion
der reagierenden Stoffe zum Katalysator bedingt werden,” p. 55.
