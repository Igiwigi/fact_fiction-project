It is seen then that these bacteria have been found in a surprisingly large number
of cases (in fact it is unusual to fail to demonstrate their presence), it must however
be clearly stated that the bacteria are not held to be responsible for the formation of
the sulphates in all these cases. This can readily and adequately be explained on
chemical and physical grounds (see ScHarFER (1981)), and it is not necessary to invoke
the aid of bacteria to explain the oxidation of atmospheric sulphur dioxide. The
existence of organisms possessed of the power to effect the oxidation of lower sulphur
compounds may however assist to explain certain difficult cases where a straightforward
explanation on other grounds is not easily forthcoming.
