Subject Areas: means of a dominant balance in parameter space. The
applied mathematics, mechanics, wave identification of this balance, which is unique, is a
motion, mathematical modelling main new result in the paper, which makes possible

a new type of shell theory based on ‘Poisson scaling’.
The mathematical approach is deductive from the
equations of motion, rather than being based on
kinematic hypotheses. A key finding, accessible via
the Poisson scaling, is that the regime of negative
ting frequency group velocities extends to high wavenumbers, while
being confined to a narrow band of frequencies.
Thus responses localized in space are possible for
near-monochromatic forcing, an important fact for
nonlinear theories of tube dynamics near the ring
frequency.
