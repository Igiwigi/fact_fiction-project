The point is that
Ech a motion in opposite directions must occur, and the ions move with a definite
‘gaverage velocity through any given solution. This is independent of any particular
Ehypothesis as to the nature of the active electrolytic molecule, and need not commit
Bus either to the “ dissociation ” or to the “ chemical ” theory. & In order to explain the facts of “ migration” Hrrrorr (‘ Pogg. Ann.,’ vols. 89, 98,
Eros, 106, 1853 to 1859) supposed that the velocities of opposite ions were different,
Awhich would produce the observed alterations of concentration round the electrodes
according to the obvious and well-known law.
