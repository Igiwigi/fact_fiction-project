It will be seen, however, that there
is good reason to suppose that some “secondary” tin is separated from this solid

considerably complicated the determination of the limiting solubility. The fact that
very gradual cooling would be required to produce this complete equilibrium is borne
out by microscopic evidence, as well as by the cooling-curves described above. Figs. 23 and 24 (Plate 6) are photo-micrographs, at a magnification of 150 diameters,
of alloys containing 10 and 15 per cent.
