state of the webs is indicated to the naked eye by conspicuousness of the blood-yessels. In perfect health
they are quite invisible without the microscope, and in all cases the appearance of any yessel as a distineb
red streak is pretty sure indication of a certain amount of irritation.

* It was believed that the solution of salt abstracted water from the blood as it flowed through the capil-
laries, and that the liquor sanguinis being consequently inspissated, the red corpuscles as8umed an abnormal
tendeney to aggregate together (8e Guy's Hospital Reports, 7oe. cit. p. 40). This view has been more recently


MR. J. LISTER ON THE EARLY STAGES OF INFLAMMATION. 661

From the facts above mentioned, I became convinced that no satisfactory explanation
j had as yet been given of the obstruction experienced by the blood-corpuscles in the
yexels of an inflamed part, and in September 1856 I again continued the investigation.
Mustard being admitted to produce inflammation in any part of the human body to
which it is applied, and also not appearing likely to act by way of exosmoxe, I selected
it as a Suitable irritant, and in order to study its effects accurately, placed a 8mall por-
tion of its moistened flour, about a line in diameter, upon the middle of the web of a
large frog under chloroform. After a while, thinking that I saw stagnation in a capil-
lary just at the margin of the mustard, I remoyed the latter with a camel's-hair brush,
and was surprised to find that throughout the whole area on which it had lain, the
capillaries were crammed with either stagnant or very slowly moving red corpuscles.
2 The limits of the part 0 affected corresponded exactly with the extent of the applica-
E tion of the mustard, although the capillaries of adjoining parts were fed and drained by
