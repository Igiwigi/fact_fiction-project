Parth-worm.—The anatomy of the reproductive system in the Earth-worm has been
made a subject of express investigation by many competent comparative anatomists.

The points in difference between the author and other observers will be indicated as
we proceed.

The anatomy of this system in the Earth-worm has ever been held as almost' an
insoluble enigma. No intelligible clue whereby to unravel the intricate glandular mass
has ever been discovered. Without such a clue the problem never can be consistently
Solved. It is hoped that such a clue or principle is afforded in the succeeding account.
It rests upon the fact that between the reproductive masses and the ciliated segmental
tubes there exists a necessary and regular connexion, and that the glandular masses of
the adjacent segments are distinct from and independent of one another. A knowledge
of this leading principle of arrangement enables the anatomist at once to convert, a con-

fused heap of glands into an orderly system of parts, and moreover, to bring the sexual
apparatus of this Annelid within the pale of definite homologies.

Every ring in the body of this worm (except a few at the head and tail) contains two
segment organs, one on either side of the intestine : they are convoluted, tubular organs,
