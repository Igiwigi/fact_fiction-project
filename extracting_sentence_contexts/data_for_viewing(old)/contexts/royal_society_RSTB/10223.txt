DNA barcoding, species, genomics, biodiversity For more than two centuries, biodiversity science has focused on the inven-
tory of species, on probing their relationships and on clarifying the factors

Author for correspondence: responsible for their diversification. The sheer diversity of life, the fact that

Paul D. N. Hebert millions of species of multi-cellular organisms await description, is a serious

barrier to scientific progress. Moreover, morphological approaches cannot
enable the census of these species in a timely or affordable fashion; the cost
of describing five million animal species has been estimated at $250 billion
and as requiring six centuries [1]. Eleven years ago, Savolainen et al. [2] con-
sidered the possibility that DNA barcoding might allow the encyclopedia of
life to be written in decades rather than a millennium. The present issue con-
siders progress towards this goal and provides a glimpse of the ways in which
DNA barcoding is transforming biodiversity science. The 16 articles included
in this issue derive from plenary presentations at the 6th International Bar-
