we conclude that the relation Ry = vq(Dilg + Duj) would require vg = . In other words, given

length scale. Thus the proof of theorem 3.5 leads to a sequence of approximations of a dissipative

solution of Euler which can be interpreted as solutions to an ‘artificial viscosity’ regularization:
with the latter interpretation, the scaling of this artificial viscosity is indeed the one predicted by
Kolmogorov’s theory.

Clearly, such artificial viscosity misses much of the structure of the actual viscosity in (3.25).
For instance it misses the estimate (3.5). In fact smooth solutions of (3.25) satisfy the stronger
identity

that ¢= aoe 3 is the typical length of the latest correction, vy would have to be Kolmogorov’s

As remarked in [75], if uq converges strongly in L? to some u, then the latter would be a weak
solution of incompressible Euler which satisfies the local energy inequality
