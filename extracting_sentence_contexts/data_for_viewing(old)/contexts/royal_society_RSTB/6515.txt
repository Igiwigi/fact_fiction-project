characteristic of the whole progeny of the cell for several months. Afterwards the
shape became more and more cylindrical. The perizonium was thrown off during the
formation of the valves (fig. 18c, Plate 3). The cell produced by an auxospore is
always considerably broader in diameter than the cell which produced the auxospore,
and given the right conditions divides immediately after formation.

What are the conditions responsible for the formation of auxospores? It was
mentioned above that both lines A and C formed auxospores shortly after the start
of the cultures. This statement should be understood in the sense that the cells were
capable of forming them under certain conditions. If, however, a culture is made from
a big cell picked out from a plankton sample, or derived from a big auxospore, the
resulting population is not capable of forming auxospores for a considerable length
of time. This fact also applies for the pennate diatoms (GEITLER 1932).

In fig. 27 measurements are given of a line (Axp.) derived from an auxospore at
the end of March. On 7 April the average diameter was 94-24. The rate of decrease
in the following months was much greater, the slope of the curve being much steeper
than in lines A and C. In 5 months the diameter decreased by more than half to 43-74

* A similar stage of auxospore formation as on fig. 18a (Plate 3), with the protoplasm extruded half
way out of one arm, has been found by Karsten (1899) in the plankton.
