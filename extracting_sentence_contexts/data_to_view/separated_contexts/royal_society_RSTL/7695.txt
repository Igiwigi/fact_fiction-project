The construction and use of this Abacus have, however, been sufficiently described
both in the © Proceedings of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society” for 3rd if
April, 1866, and more fully in my recently published work, called © The Substitution 3
of Similars,” which contains a figure of the Abacus. I will only remark, therefore, that
while the logical slate or printed abecedarium is convenient for the private study of
logical problems, the abacus is peculiarly adapted for the logical classroom. By its
use the operations of classification and selection, on which Boorz's logic, and in fact any
logic must be founded, can be represented, and the clearest possible solution of any 4
question can be shown to a class of students, each step in the solution being made
distinctly apparent. 4

abecedarium can be reduced to a purely mechanical form, T must first point out that
certain simple acts of classification are alone required for the purpose.
