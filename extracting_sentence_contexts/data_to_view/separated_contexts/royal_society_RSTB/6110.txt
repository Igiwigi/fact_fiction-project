the mean loss, during 24 hours’ starvation at a saturation deficiency of 17-8 mm
(relative humidity 44%). Similar work was done at three other humidities, Table
XII. In spite of the fact that flies under two hours old were used, there is consider-
able lack of uniformity in the mean weights at the commencement of the experiments. The data given in Table XII under “ original weight’? show this.
