In
studying the mechanism by which the movements are brought about at the various
joints, I found that action of the deltoid produced, in addition to the movement at
the shoulder, a passive extension at the elbow joint. This latter might be produced
by the force of gravity, the forearm simply falling as the upper arm is raised ; but on

the other hand, it can be produced owing to the fact that the long head of the triceps
is not long enough to allow the upper arm to be raised to the level of the shoulder
without its pulling on the forearm, and thus producing extension at the elbow. A
more remarkable effect, however, is that which resulted when traction was directly
made on the triceps, for not only was extension at the elbow produced, but extension
of the whole extremity including the digits, all the segments of the limb being thus
brought into a straight line. The way in which this is produced is that the extensor
carpi radialis passes over two joints, viz.:
