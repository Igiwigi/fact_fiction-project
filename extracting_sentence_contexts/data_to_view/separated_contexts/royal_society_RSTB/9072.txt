Expectations are based on past experience. We are disappointed when our favourite author, admired
musician or best-loved car company turns out a product that
underperforms. In summary, we treat value as a relation between an arte-
fact, its creator and its observers and the context in which
creation and observation takes place.

(b) Exploration, transformation and the paradigm shift
Boden [3] also introduces an important philosophical distinc-
tion, between exploratory creativity, where the conceptual space

being explored is fixed (though possibly not all visible, and
possibly infinite) and exploration occurs within that space
(for example, different songs in a particular style), and transfor-
mational creativity in which the space itself is subject to change
(developing from one style to another). Coupled with suc-
cessful persuasion, transformational creativity is what leads
to a paradigm shift in Kuhn's philosophy of science [4]. Boden
proposes that Little-C creativity is exploratory, and Big-C crea-
tivity is transformational, but history is littered with exceptions
to this: Mozart, for example, perfected a style that Haydn intro-
duced, but Mozart is universally regarded as the greater
creator.
