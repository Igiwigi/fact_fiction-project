The approximation is sufficiently near when the difficulty of getting the snbstance
in at all a stable tate is considered. Two views might be taken of the constitution
of this singular compound (1), that it is nitroprusside of sodium with 3 equiys. of
sulphuret of sodium attached—

Fe, Cy,, 3NO, 5Na+3NaS+6HO;
but this would scarcely account for its extreme facility of decomposition ; it may
therefore be supposed that caustic soda is attached to the alt, as we have seen that

it can be, in studying the action of alkalies on the nitroprussides, and that the sulphur
has taken the place of the oxygen, thus :—

Fe, Cy;, 3NS, 5Na+3NaO+6HO. Either of these formula: would suit the analysis ; in support of the latter may be
adduced the fact observed by GrEcory, that sulpburet of nitrogen in the presence
of caustic alkalies acquires a deep transitory amethyst colour, which, on disappear-
ing, evolved ammonia, a description exactly accordant with the present case. Action of Sulphuretted Hydrogen on the Nitroprussides.

30. Sulphuretted hydrogen decomposes the soluble nitroprussides.
