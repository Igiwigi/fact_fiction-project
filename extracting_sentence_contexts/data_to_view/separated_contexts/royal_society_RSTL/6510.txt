This conclusion agrees with that expressed by Principal
Forts in the: last of the preceding extracts; but: the reason assigned is very different. The absence of great fluid pressure within: the: glacier in snch case is not- due to: the
absence of capillarity, but to the particular condition of its duets and crevices being open
in every part, of the bounding surface of the mass: There caw be no expenditure of vis
vive in producing pressure on a Mooth: surface, as is/ well known, though: such pressure
must necessarily be produced in the case before us, as/in all cases of constrained motion
when the constraint is produced by the action of uct surfaces. The fact-of no vis'viva
being lost does not imply that no internal pressure would be produced:

62. But. let us now turn to. the far more important case- inÂ» which the passage of the
water through the s8mall ducts of any mass, as that of a glacier, is impeded by the
friction of. the 8ides- of the ducts. Tt follows, as shown im the preceding explanation,
that, since in actual cases! there is' no overflowing of water from the pores and. crevices,
here assumed to pervade one' part of the mass: as: well as another, the fluid pressure in
all confluent, ducts at. the point of confluence must/ be' the same, and, therefore, inde-
pendent: of the height above that point: at which each! duct may meet the external
gurface of the glacier.
