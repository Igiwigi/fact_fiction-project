this corresponds to a ratio of 2:957 molecules of carbon dioxide to 1 of V, O;, or nearly

Wy
in the proportion of 3 tofl. Normal- or ortho-s0dium yanadate is Na, V O,, or _ O..

Hence there is no doubt that yanadic acid in its normal state acts as a tribasic acid.
It is my intention fully to investigate the constitution and properties of the vanadates
at a future time.

V. VANADIUM OXYCHLORTDES.

1. Vanadinm Oxytrichloride, or Vanadyl Trichloride, V O Cl,, molec. weight 17367
(terchloride of vanadium of Brrzrius).—The fact that the lemon-yellow-coloured liquid
chloride of vanadium prepared by the action of chlorine upon the trioxide does contain
oxygen, contrary to the distinct statements of previous experimenters, was ascertained in
various ways —

(1) A few grammes of the lemon-coloured liquid chloride was placed in a bulb
attached to a long combustion-tube half filled with pure sugar-charcoal and half with
metallic copper. A current of dry hydrogen, purified from oxygen according to the
method previously described, was then passed over the bulb and cold tube until every
trace of air was expelled; the carbon and copper were then heated to redness, and as
800n as the escaping gases had ceased for fifteen minutes to render baryta-water turbid,
Liebig's bulbs containing clear baryta-water were attached. The bulb containing the
oxychloride, which up to this point had been kept cool, was now warmed, and the
