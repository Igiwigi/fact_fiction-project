Parylene is deposited by chemical vapour deposition, during which the monomer absorbs to
a surface and then polymerizes spontaneously to form high molecular weight linear parylene
films. Importantly, this process can take place at room temperature, making the coating process
compatible with pre-fabricated heat-sensitive components [29].

On the basis of differences in contact angle, Delivopoulos et al. [30] hypothesized that
photolithographically printed parylene-C might serve as a cell repellent domain, leaving cells to : =

adhere specifically to a background of SiO. As such, oxidized silicon wafers were patterned with Sy
parylene features using standard clean room photolithographic process, then incubated with fetal 2
calf serum (a standard component of cell culture media), and plated with murine hippocampal aed
cells (a combination of neurons and glia). Although accurate cell patterning was achieved, cells in 22
fact adhered to parylene domains and were repulsed by SiO (figure 3). This unexpected finding : Ss
led to questions about the impact that the photolithographic processes had upon the downstream DNS
adhesive behaviour of the two substrates, and also how the components of serum interact with the : =
two substrates [31]. Subsequently, a number of other cell types (both neuronal and non-neuronal) 73

have been trialled on this platform, revealing heterogeneous patterning behaviours [32,33]. Our
recent work has focused on (i) trying to disentangle the cell adhesion mechanisms at work on
parylene-C : SiOz constructs and (ii) refining neuronal patterning such that meaningful, functional
neuronal networks might be generated.

The hippocampal cells initially tested were a combination of both neurons and glial cells.
We first sought to pattern neurons alone, questioning whether isolated neurons can pattern
or whether they rely on the presence of glial (or another) supporting cell type. Though the
