demonstrated the existence of a neurofibrillar network in these cells, and his observations
were later confirmed by those of his pupil La Vriua (37). This network was in silver
preparations frequently better impregnated than a similar network in the neurones of
Averpacn’s and Metssner’s plexuses. The existence of these fibrille, the varicose
form of the processes, and the fact that they stain deeply with methylene blue, claimed
to be specific for nerve cells, were held by Casan and La Vitxa to demonstrate their
nervous character. But it must be noted that neither Casau nor La Vinxa succeeded
in tracing a connection between them and the neurones and extrinsic fibres of the
enteric plexuses, although they state they were able to trace their processes to the
smooth muscle fibres and to the crypts of LreperKtauy, in relation to which they describe
them as terminating. Tn 1895, P. Scuunrz (59) gave a description of these cells and definitely stated that
they are of a nervous nature, and in 1920 EH.
