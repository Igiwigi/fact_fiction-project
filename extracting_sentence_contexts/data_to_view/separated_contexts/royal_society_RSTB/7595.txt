In an auger traverse at Radford Semele (around 350644 and so just south
of the edge of figure 9), two beds of undoubted Chalky Boulder Clay were interbedded
with red plastic lake clays (section on figure 10), Other examples will be quoted later
when the general implications of the postulated lake are discussed, but it is clear that
the lake facies of the Wolston clay is equivalent to Chalky Boulder Clay and also to the
red boulder clays of the west of the area, and that the glacier which helped to pond the
water also advanced spasmodically over the deposits of its own lake. Pebbles occurring in the clays, in a thin gravel which forms the base of the Wolston
sand, and also in the Dunsmore gravel which overlies the Wolston Series, were retained
from the auger samples and classified with the results shown in table 4. TABLE 4

The figures for flint in the Lower Wolston clay are a little misleading—in fact, the lower
part is normally devoid of flint, and it was the upper half only which yielded this material
and then only in abundance at Wolston; but numerically the sample here was rather large,
with a consequent effect on the average obtained from all the holes. The general trend is clear—the Wolston clay commences with little but Bunter pebbles
and Keuper sandstone as erratics, and ends with these much reduced and flint equal in
importance to the Bunter material. The Dunsmore gravel continues the trend, with
Keuper sandstone reduced to vanishing point, Bunter pebbles down to half their original
importance, and flint now dominant.
