THEORY OF ELECTRO-CHEMICAL DECOMPOSITION. 683

rence an interest surpassing that of any other of its properties ; for the power is
not only intimately connected with the continuance, if not the production, of
the electrical phenomena, but has furnished us with the most beautiful demon-
strations of the nature of many compound bodies; has in the hands of Bzc-
QUEREL been employed in compounding bodies ; has given us several new sub-
stances, and sustains us with the hope that when thoroughly understood it will
produce many more.

478. What may be considered as the general facts of electro-chemical de-
composition are agreed to by nearly all who haye written on the subject.
They consist in the separation of the decomposable substance acted upon into
its proximate or sometimes ultimate principles, whenever both poles of the
pile are in contact with that substance in a proper condition ; in the eyolution
of these principles at distant points, i. e. at the poles of the pile where they are
either finally set free or enter into union with the substance of the poles ; and
in the constant determination of the eyolyed elements or principles to parti-
cular poles according to certain well ascertained laws.

479. But the views of men of science vary much as to the nature of the
action by which these effects are produced ; and as it is certain that we shall
be better able to apply the power when we really understand the manner in
