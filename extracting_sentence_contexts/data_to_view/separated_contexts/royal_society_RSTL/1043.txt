Is the application of the semen to the
vagina or uterus sufficient to stimulate the ovaries to perform
their first procreative operations, without enabling them to
achieve any thing more ? and does it require the permanent and
active energies of this fluid, operating by direct contact on the
surface of the ovaries, to produce the full measure of their ef-
fects? But as these are queries which cannot be answered from
the mere reflexions of the closet, I must engage anew in the
business of experimental inquiry. But the first step that ought
to be taken in the management of this question, is to give full
confirmation to the above fact, bya repetition of the experiment;
I therefore engageda keeper of rabbits to procure me six in high
breeding condition, as s0on as possible. EXPERIMENT,

Within the space of a month, I cut through the fallopian
tube on one side in six rabbits. The season was warm, and
consequently favourable for breeding.
