However, their locations are generally not known in on-the-fly
simulations of real molecular systems. Thus, it is not always possible to cancel the GP of the
adiabatic states [37]. Another drawback comes from the fact that the diagonal elements of the
non-adiabatic coupling matrix, also known as diagonal Bornâ€”Oppenheimer corrections (DBOCs),
are not often calculated in electronic structure packages and are furthermore non-integrable
unless special basis functions are utilized [38,39]. Thus, DBOCs are also often overlooked. Despite
these difficulties, time-dependent Gaussian functions are very often employed in non-adiabatic
dynamics for the advantages they provide in on-the-fly quantum dynamics.
