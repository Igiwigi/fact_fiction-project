Salivary Secretion.—The salivary glands are well developed and oecupy the greater
part of the abdominal cavity. They are filled with a thick secretion which coagulates
in water and is not soluble in spirit. It is poured out on the substratum in the form of
two flattened threads applied side by side, which are very sticky and very strong.
I have indicated their nature in a former paper (1927), p. 122). The salivary secretion
furnishes a substratum for the attachment of the hooks and plays as important a réle
in the fixation of the larva as the hooks on the various appendages. At the point of
attachment these fine silk threads are spread out into a flower-like pattern by the close
application of the appendage.

Pupa.—The pupa is more or less enclosed by the cocoon manufactured by the larva
from its sticky salivary secretion. The pupa lies loose in the cocoon, except for the
fact that the spines on the ventral side are entangled in a number of fine silk threads

arising from the posterior end of the floor. In preserved specimens the pupa can be
easily taken out of the cocoon, but under natural conditions, where the current strongly
presses the dorsal wall of the cocoon against thé pupa, the forwardly directed hooks on
the dorsal surface of the pupa become fixed in the dorsal wall of the cocoon and anchor
the animal. Purt (loc. cit., pp. 330-333) has described in detail the arrangement of
the spines on the body of the pupa. The function of these becomes evident when it is
remembered that the pupa is always found with the head pointing downstream (p. 209),
which condition is essential for the emergence of the fly in a rushing stream. The head
