bundles pass actually into the commissure, although they slant in the required
direction. It is possible that they take a longitudinal course within the white
column. The view of BropEr* and his pupilst that the fibres of the white commissure
run to nerve-cells in the ventral cornu, although opposed by Srittinet and untrue
in the sense in which GerLacu§ advocated it, has much in its favour. In the white
commissure are collected together fibres from and for manifold end-stations, and that
some of these fibres are of the kind described by Binpenr is rendered all the more
probable by the presence of the outlying cells above-mentioned.

Out-lying Ganglion-Cells in the Lateral Column.

The remarkable group of nerve-cells discovered by Bercrr|| in the cord of Alligator
and allied forms still remains, so far as I am aware, an unexplained fact. I have, as
already stated, never seen any unequivocal trace of it in the Mammalian cord. It may
be that a vestige of it does really exist in the shape of a thickened rib in the sub-pial
