In the first place we find the bright termination of the truncated
positive column (to which our theory assigned the functions of a stria) actually taking the form of &
single perfectly formed stria. In the next place we see that this stria, having just the same advantages
that a negative glow has in respect of fixity of conditions, and probably also in respeet of the readiness
with which negative electricity is supplied to it, is like a negative glow, followed by a long negative dark
space. It is in fact in much the same position, electrically and in all other respects, as the negative glow.
of a tube where the negative terminal is a concave metal plate occupying the whole of the tube. Thin)
strongly confirms the view that the negative glow and the negative dark space form a physical unib of
discharge (following the language of our former paper) identical in nature and function with the unib
composed of any stria and its dark space, but modified by local cireumstances; since we find that when
we produce a 8trin under the 8ame circumstances under which a negative glow is formed it is attended by
a similar long dark space.

+ In connexion with what has been above stated about the proportion between the strength of tho Y
main and the interfering discharges, and also with the experiments deseribed in Section IX. of our.
former paper (p. 201, and Plate 18, fig. 16), the following fact deseryes mention. In gome cases "al
two rings of tinfoil were used, and two striw corresponding to them were formed by connecting them
