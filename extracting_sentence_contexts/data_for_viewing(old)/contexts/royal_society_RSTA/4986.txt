Furthermore, the restriction to G® of a representation of G corresponds to the functor x*.
(2) If G is an irreducible object of J(F), then we have a geometric isomorphism

a*S =) Air*F),

where Aj is an irreducible representation of G for each i. Two such sheaves have isomorphic restriction to
V x E, if and only if the respective Aj are the same.

Proof. The first part is a standard fact. To deduce (2), we simply note that from the last part
of lemma 2.4, the pullback z*§ is geometrically irreducible if G is geometrically irreducible. We
then obtain the stated formula from the classification of irreducible representations of a direct
product. a

We now present a first classification theorem that is well suited to cases where all sheaves
involved are self-dual.


Theorem 2.7 (Diagonal classification). Let F be U-generous and let x : V x Ey > U x Fy be the
finite Abelian étale covering corresponding to the surjective homomorphism

1(U x Fp, ij) > G/C?.
