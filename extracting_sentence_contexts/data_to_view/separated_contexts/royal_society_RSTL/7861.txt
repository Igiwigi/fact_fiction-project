The employment of iron and steel, and the improvements which the manufacture of
both is undergoing, fortunately facilitate the concentration of the strength of the ship
in those parts which are subject to the greatest stresses; and to further this object, a
closer knowledge of these stresses than has hitherto been possessed is much needed. Bovevss, the author of the famous * Traits du Navire * (1746), was one of the earliest
authors who gave consideration to the strains bronght upon ships by the unequal distri-
bution of weight and buoyancy. 'The approximate and imperfect character of his theo-
retical investigations will readily be seen from the fact that he asumes the immersed
portion of the ship to be formed of the halves of two equal right cones, set base to base,
with their common axis in the water-line. He then constructs a curye the ordinates of
which represent the areas of the corresponding sections of the cones, and this he calls
the curve of buoyancy for the body. It necessarily comes out a parabola for each cone.
