31 b, have their homologues in the ascending central cavities and
branching tubes of the areolz of the Diplopterus, fig. 20 m. In the same way the
ascending cul-de-sac in each areola of the Megalichthys appears to correspond with
the pulp-cavity, whilst the arborescent tubuli which it gives off represent the dentine-
like tubes of the shagreen. The chief difference appears to consist in the fact, that
in the Ganoid, the areolz, being closely aggregated upon a bony basis, have coalesced,
and been flattened, superiorly, to an uniform level; whilst in the Placoid, each areola
forms an isolated conical tooth, implanted in the soft integument. The different de-
grees to which the same structure may be either flattened, or drawn out and become
acuminate, is seen in the various parts of the exo-skeleton of 1Zacropoma, showing
that the process is a very trivial one, involving no typical change*. *
