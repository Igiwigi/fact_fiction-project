of embryology, it will be admitted to be pretty well proved that the sub-orders
Tetracoralla and Hexacoralla are based on a feature which became gradually in the
course of time removed backward in the life-history of the individual until now it is
presented only in embryonic stages. The diagram of the recent polyp Seriatopora
shows twelve septa bilaterally arranged, correlated with the retention of the primi-
tive feature of a pair of fossule, I have entered the numerals against the mesen-
teries in diagram E according to the same system followed in diagrams A to D, for
the purpose of demonstrating the upholding of the significance of the ‘‘ embryonic
pairs ” in this Recent coral.

10. Brrzr Review or MaprePorARIAN Evo.urion.

It is a familiar fact that many “ radially-symmetrical” Madreporarian corals are
still distinctly bilaterally symmetrical in young stages. Fungia is a well-known
example. The wide-spread occurrence of bilateral symmetry in the polyps of
ecenenchymatous colonies has been frequently drawn attention to in this paper
(cf. p. 271). These are cases of bilateral symmetry among recent corals. As soon as
fossil corals are studied, the number of bilateral types is seen to be very great in the
geological ages between Paleozoic and Recent time.

Bilateral symmetry is much more widely spread amongst Triassic and Jurassic
corals than it has been the custom to admit. Itis a constant feature in many genera,
and in others all stages of transition are seen between bilaterally symmetrical calyces,
even in some cases with a fossular depression, and radially symmetrical calyces.
