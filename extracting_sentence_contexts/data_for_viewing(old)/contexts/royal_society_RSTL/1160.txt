veins, which in other parts of the circulation generally
happens., Between the villi and the muscular coats of the
stomach there is a very fine elastic cellular membrane: it
admits of being drawn out to more than three times its na-
tural thickness ; and it was by doing s0, Mr. Bauer caused
these smaller arteries to be exposed, and, along with them,
small valvular vessels quite empty; the valves were very
numerous, and nearly at equal distances. In tracing these
towards the cavity, they became indistinct just as they en-
tered the villii These appearances are shown in Pl, IIT.
fig. 2, 3, 4 This representation of the valves in these ves-
sels, as well as that of the valves of the vessels in the brain,
may be considered as demonstrations of the fact ; and still
more valuable than preparations, since the appearance can
be better preserved,

To show the course of the absorbed fluids, as well as to give
a clear idea of every thing - connected with s0 important
a discovery, a drawing of the spleen, the vas breve, and
cardiac portion of the stomach, is annexed [PI.IV;Jand as the
trunk of the splenic vein forms one of the trunks of the
vena portze, the Jiquids are directly carried to the liver,
