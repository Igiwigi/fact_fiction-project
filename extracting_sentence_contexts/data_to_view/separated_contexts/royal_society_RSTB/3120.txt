This author also comes to the
conclusion that the irregularity of the nucleus is not an artifact, but is due to the
active participation of the nucleus in the cell-metabolism, and results from an
endeavour on the part of the latter to increase the opportunities for reaction at its
surface with the surrounding cytoplasm. Both these authors, like many others,
describe a partial disappearance of the nuclear membrane, and accept this as a further
indication of the controlling influence exerted by the nucleus on the cell-metabolism. The suspicion that, in these spontaneous movements of the nucleus on the one
hand, and the fixation artifacts I have described for Antedon on the other, we have
to deal with identical phenomena is considerably strengthened by the fact that, as
we have seen was the case in the yolk nucleus, these conflicting accounts have also
been given for the nucleus of Antedon itself. Thus Korscuznt* figures and briefly
describes the nuclear irregularity in the ova of Antedon, and interprets it in the same
way as for other types. Spontaneous amoeboid movements on the part of the nucleus, such as BAMBEKE
Korscuenr, and others have assumed; is not the only explanation that has been put
forward.
