Rather better estimates can be made for mosquitoes. It was found that mosquitoes began
to show a noticeable preference in orientation, by ceasing altogether to fly against the
direction of moving floor stripes, when the stripe movement exceeded about 0-15 m./sec.
At considerably lower stripe speeds flight in this direction was already slow, wavering and
less frequent than flight in the opposite direction. If we take 0-10 m./sec. as a generous
estimate of the minimum stimulatory stripe speed for a mosquito flying against the stripes
and 10cm. above them, and if we take 0-15 m./sec. as the mosquitoâ€™s air speed, then the
minimum stimulatory ground speed will be 0-25m./sec. If so, the minimum stimulatory
ground speed will be 2-5 m./sec. at 1 m. above the stripes, 25 m./sec. at 10 m., and so on.
Hence the maximum height at which the mosquito will receive effective optomotor stimula-
tion, in a 1 m./sec. wind, will be (1+-0-15)/2-5 = 0-46 m.; in a 10 m./sec. wind it will be
4-6 m., and so on. These estimates of the maximum compensatory height for mosquitoes
seem in fact too low, for the writer has observed various midges, mosquitoes and may-flies
swarming up to 2m. away from the nearest fixed object and maintaining their position
against the gentlest breezes, by closely regulating their air speed and orientation.

In place of the optomotor theory of behaviour in wind, Williams (1930), concerned
primarily with butterfly migration, advanced the suggestion that migrants are guided by
an innate sense of direction regardless of the wind. Without details as to wind speed and
height of flight the data on butterfly directions cannot be compared with the locust data,
but Williams has applied his suggestion to other features of behaviour in wind for which
comparable locust observations are available. He quotes two butterfly observers as recording

an inverse relation between wind strength and height of flight, the insects coming low when
