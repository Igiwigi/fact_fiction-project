August the 28th, the former experiments were repeated by
Sir HExnRy ENGLEFIELD, Mr. RAMSDEN, and myself, upon the

-eye of a young lad, and the result was similar to the others, the

motion of the cornea was uncommonly distinct, Sir Henry
now became the subject of the experiment, and changed the
adjustment of his eye from one distance to another in a very
irregular manner, without giving the smallest information,
with a view to embarrass Mr. Ramspex who was the observer,
but without effect, for Mr. Ramspen was able to tell every
change in distance he had made, without a single mistake ;
this exceeded our expectation, and appeared to us $0 satisfac-
tory that we required no further proofs of the truth of our
former observations. Before we concluded our experiments, every mode that
could be devised was put in practice to see how far there might
be any deception ; the eye was moved upon its axis, and in
different directions, but these motions did not give at all simi-
lar appearances to those seen in the adjusting of the eye to
different distances. From the different experiments which I have had the ho-
nour to lay before this learned Society, I shall consider the
following facts to have been ascertained. 15t, That the eye has a power of adjusting itself to different
distances when deprived of the crystalline lens; and therefore
the fibrous and laminated structure of that lens is not in-
tended to alter its form, but to prevent reflections in the pas-
sage of the rays through the surfaces of media of different
densities, and to correct spherical aberration.

2d, That the cornea is made up of lamine; that it is elas-
tic, and when stretched, is capable of being elongated 7+ part
of its diameter, contracting to its former length immediately
upon being left to itself. gd, That the tendons of the four straight muscles of the eye

are continued on to the edge of the cornea, and terminate, or
are inserted, in its external lamina; their action will therefore
extend to the edge of the cornea,

4th, That in changing the focus of the eye from seeing with
parallel rays to a near distance, there is a visible alteration
produced in the figure of the cornea, rendering it more con-
vex; and when the eye is again adapted to parallel rays, the
alteration by which the cornea is brought back to its former
state is equally visible.
