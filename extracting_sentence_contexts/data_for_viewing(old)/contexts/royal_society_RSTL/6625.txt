rests ultimately upon the assumption that the ratio of any term or partial aggregate of
terms in V to V itself is a positive fraction, and as this assumption is satisfied when
@\, Tz..-T, are positive quantities, it follows that the calculated value of the probability
sought will always lie within the limits which it would have had if determined by
observation from the same experience as the data.

But though the test last mentioned is one which must necessarily be satisfied by a
true method, it is of infinitely less theoretical importance than that from which it is
derived, viz. the tes: which consists in the absolute connexion between possibility in
the data and formal consistency in the method.

As the conclusions of Propositions IV. and V. depend upon the form of the function V
and the fact that its coefficients are positive, it follows that if in the application of the
method to questions of probability we substituted any other positive values for unity in
the coefficients of V, leaving the rest of the process as before, we should still be able to
determine @#;, Tz, ... 4, as Positive quantities, or as limits of svch, and the altered value of
the probability sought would still be consistent with the experience from which the data
are 8upposed to be derived. It would, however, properly speaking, be a value of inter-
polation, not a probability.

I will close with a few remarks upon the general nature of the method, and of the
solutions to which it leads.
