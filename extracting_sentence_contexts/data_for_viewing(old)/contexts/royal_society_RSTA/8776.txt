difference of behaviour between Diffuse and Sharp series. Inspection of Table XIII.
indicates that the line 17065 shows very little tendency to change in relation to
\4713 by the action of this Hydrogen—or at least that the change in the Diffuse
series is of quite another order. Moreover, the change among the lines \A7065, 4713,
4121, though comparatively small, is quite definitely present as a combination of two
effects. | For \4121 is reduced relatively to 14718, as by the effect of the trace
of Hydrogen, while 4713, as against 7065, is quite definitely enhanced. It
seems that the Sharp series under these circumstances is just ceasing to show the
first phenomenon, due to the trace of Hydrogen, and commencing to show the second,
so that if the quantity of Hydrogen were increased yet further, the second might
predominate, In other words, the essential difference between the Diffuse and Sharp
series is that in the latter case a more considerable admixture of impurity is needed
to produce the effects observed in the Diffuse series. Sharp series are in fact sensitive,
to an equal extent with Diffuse series, to the influence of a trace of Hydrogen, but
not to a comparable degree to the different mechanism of interaction with large
quantities of Hydrogen. We feel no doubt that the available data can be summarised
in this way, for the phenomena shown by the Parhelium spectrum follow the same
course throughout. ‘

The Principal series of Helium, showing only one member A8888 is not, of course,
capable of test in this manner by the present experiments.

Principal Series under the same Conditions.—The Diffuse series of Didteliinn
contains five members on some of our plates, and we can therefore make by its use a
much more exhaustive test of the conclusions outlined in the preceding section. It
