Now the difference for the two lines in question gives v = 20°28+°41, with
PascueEn’s estimates of his errors. The difference for P, (2) and P, (2) is 18°75+°36,
which is decidedly against the conclusion. In favour of it, on the other hand, is the
fact that a similar relation shows itself under Na. There is another unallotted pair,
4642°35 R. (50 8.) and 4638°6 R., with a separation 17°4044°5 dd, where dd denotes
the wave-length difference error of observation. The first has a wave-number about
P(o)—VD(2), viz, 21534°92+4°5d) as against 215382+7.
