Yet strains carrying more than one sym —
element are rare. Are ‘dual-sym’ strains more common in soil environments—where their symbiosis functions are down- 2
regulated—and does nodulation lead to displacement of one element by the other? =

How do sym elements mobilize through the rhizobial metapopulation? The legume symbiosis is just one of numerous niches that 8
rhizobial populations inhabit, and studies suggest that sym-gene-carrying rhizobia may in fact be in the minority in the popu- 35
lation as a whole. The vast majority of studies have focused on rhizobial strains isolated from plant nodules, but it remains o
unclear how sym elements are shared across the wider metapopulation. For example, are all rhizobia within a population i
potential sym element hosts, or are rhizobia occupying alternative niches maladapted to conversion to symbiosis via HGT? er
