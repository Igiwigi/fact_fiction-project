Tn the accompanying maps the lines of certain metallic vapours reversed in the solar
spectrum are given under the spectrum mapped by the new method. J1# will be scen |
that invariably the reversed lines are simply those which are longest in the 8pectrum. It is not necessary on the present occasion to dwell upon the great importance of this
determination, both in connexion with the fact just stated and the other facts touching
the lines which remain longest in chemical combinations} and mechanical mixtures.
1t supplies us at once with the true test to apply to the reversal of solar lines, and a
guide of the highest value in spectrum observations of the chromosphere and
photosphere. It is one, doubtless, which will shortly enable us to determine the

presence of new materials in the solar atmosphere, and it is seen at once that to the
last published table of solar elements (that of THALEX) must be added, zinc, aluminium,
and possibly strontium < as a result of the application of the new test.

doubtful.
