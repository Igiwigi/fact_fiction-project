be scrupulously avoided.

12. ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE METHOD

A few illustrations follow of the application of the above methods to certain published
phyllotaxis data, though it should be borne in mind that these data were not collected for
the purpose and so do not provide ideal material.

(a) Dryopteris aristata

As a first example may be taken the apex of the fern Dryopteris aristata, which presents a
dilemma when classification is attempted by the method in general use, i.e. the numbers
of contact parastichies in the two directions. The primordia are in fact very far from being
in contact one with another, each being separated from its neighbours by an expanse of
bare apical surface. It has already been pointed out (Richards 1948) that methods involving
the use of plastochrone ratios provide the sole means of classifying and assessing such systems.
Wardlaw (1949, p. 171), however, writes concerning his own text-figures 5 and 6 ‘it would
be more accurate to describe [primordium] J, as originating between [primordia] P, and P;,
rather than between P, and P,, although the latter description is not incorrect’; and again,
on p. 188 concerning his text-figure 44, ‘In a phyllotactic system of this kind some investi-
gators would no doubt regard P, and P,as the “‘contact” primordia. But direct observation
of fern apices indicates that the primordia immediately adjacent to J, are P, and P;.’
Clearly such a position is unsatisfactory; for in dicotyledonous apices there is no guarantee
that the contact system of primordia is the same as the system of nearest primordia, when
distances are measured from their central regions; that this is not always so is readily seen
