Thus for these models, we have the following definition: 1s
areal
XQ
Etotal
PE Ignorable = PE,Non-ignorable = i =. We use the posterior predictive distribution of Pf|Y,R to derive inference on the error rate. Note, we can do this after fitting the appropriate model despite having not observed the latent
variables EMis, To do so, we use the fact that for the ignorable model the following holds:

EPS ~ Binom(R;, pizi)
and
EM's ~ Binom(J; — Ri, pi(1 — 7))-

Similarly, for the non-ignorable model:

EQS ~ Binom(R;, pizt2/)

and

EMSs ~ Binom(Jj — Rj, pi(1 — 72/)).

5. Application

In this section, we consider the black-box study of latent palmar prints presented in Eldridge et al.
[5]. Using the models introduced in §4, we offer a re-analysis of their data to explore the impact
that missing data might be having on error rate estimates.
