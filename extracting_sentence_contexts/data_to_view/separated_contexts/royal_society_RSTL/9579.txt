But n=xa and the snccessive values of n correspond to the snccessive integers

We are now in a position to find the values of the coefficients (A), (B) in the

expressions (40) : for it may be easily shown that, if n;, 1g be bwo different values of
1, 1, 7, two different values of n” from equations (39), then

From these results we may separate the different values of A, B: for since when

B may be found in a similar manner, and Jlikewise also the terms depending on sin mp. Collecting all these results for the value of P (6, p, z) at an external point on the
