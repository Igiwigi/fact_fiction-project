events in the Lesser Antilles suggests that earthquakes occur most frequently in this
region at times of increasing magmatic pressure. The fact that seismic activity has,
in some instances, terminated with the occurrence of a volcanic eruption is then to
be regarded as a consequence of the release of magmatic pressure. It is possible that

such a release of pressure was brought about in the neighbourhood of Montserrat by
the occurrence of the severe earthquake of 10 November 1935.

The most plausible explanation of the local earthquakes in Montserrat is therefore
that they are due to magmatic intrusion. Such a view accounts for the fact that the
disturbed regions are very restricted in area and offers a simple explanation of the
very sharp vertical accelerations which the shocks sometimes produce. One can
imagine that the shocks are produced by a kind of “hammer” blow produced when
the magma, breaking through a barrier which it has weakened by its action during
times of increasing magmatic pressure, is suddenly brought to rest by the opposition
of a new barrier.

At a certain stage in the history of a volcano in this region it is possible that such
intrusive processes may lead to a general strengthening of the volcanic edifice by a
kind of grouting process, so that subsequently the volcano is better able to resist the
incidence of magmatic pressure. Such effects would explain the existence in the
restricted area presented by the island of Montserrat of as many as six old volcanoes.
