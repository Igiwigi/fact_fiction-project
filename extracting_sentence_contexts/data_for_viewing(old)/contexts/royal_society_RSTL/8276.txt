are drawn. It will be observed that the vane will alter its direction very gradually
in the afternoon hours, and rather quickly between 21 and 0 hours; that it will be
almost steady at east from 6 to 9 hours, after which a very rapid movement will take
place, changing its direction 180* in about three hours. Snch movements of the
vane are of yery frequent occurrence at Bombay during most of the year, but especi-
ally during the month of October, when the daily normal wind has a smaller velocity
than at any other time of the year and is very variable in direction. Professor DovE
pointed out the fact that right-handed rotations of the vane at Bombay were more
numerous in October than in any other month of the year; and he snggested that the
operation of local causes might account for the excess, but he left the point to the
decision of the observer. 'The foregoing explanation of right-handed rotations of the
yane throughout the year affords also an explanation of the greater number of rotations
in October, and shows it to be due to the fact that the daily normal winds of that month
are smaller and more variable than in any other month, and therefore lie more frequently
within the diurnal-variation curve. A separate treatment of the daily normal winds, 80
as to show their variability at different times of the year, is now in progress, and it
brings out the fact here mentioned very prominently. Further, whenever the land- and
sea-breeze and also the daily normal are simultaneously almost entirely suspended (which,
however, rarely occurs, and never except during the monsoon months), there will be a
double rotation of the yane in one day, the movement round the compass approaching
more and more nearly to uniformity of progression as the land- and sea-breeze and the
daily normal become less and less.

It will be noticed that the daily normals which blow from different directions will all be
differently modified by the superposition upon them of the diurnal variation of the wind:
