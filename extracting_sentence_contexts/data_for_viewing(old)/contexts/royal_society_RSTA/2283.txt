Then we can show that the equation (3.8) admits a family of solutions labelled by the real
parameter Ao lying in the range [14,15]
0<Ag <min (cro, * po) . (3.12)

In this case, all four functions f(r), p(r), A(r) and B(r) must be positive for r> 0, and A(r)/9? +
B(r)/¢? and B(r) become increasing functions of r. So we have 0 < bo < Ao. Furthermore, we have
B(r) = A(r) = 0 for all ranges, and B(r) must approach A(r) with an exponential damping. Note
that, with the experimental fact sin? Oy = 0.2312, (3.12) can be written as 0 < Ag < epo.

With the boundary condition (3.11) we can integrate (3.8). For example, with A = B =0, we
have the Cho-Maison monopole. In general, with Aj 4 0, we find the Cho—Maison dyon [13].

Near the origin, the dyon solution has the following behaviour:
