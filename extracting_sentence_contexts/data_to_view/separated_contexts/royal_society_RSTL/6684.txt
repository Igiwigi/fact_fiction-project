T doubt if a nerve-cell anywhere exists whose
fibres pass to their destination in the same direction. In connexion with this question
I may revert to the fact T haye already stated *, that whenever any compound nerve-
trunk, large or s8mall, composed of any form or number of nerye-fibres in any part of
the organigm of man or animals, passes into another trunk running at, or nearly at,
right angles to it, its component fibres divide into branches which pass in opposite direc-
tions. This general fact is most important; and I have never seen anything to make
me believe that the disposition is not universal, and therefore essential even to the
simplest nervous apparatus. As the disposition exists in bundles of fibres which there
is reason to believe are purely sensitive, as well as in the case of those which are purely
motor, it looks as if fibres invariably passed in two directions, whether they be traced
from their peripheral distribution or from their central origin. The arrangement spoken
of is represented in fig. 40, which is from the submucous areolar tissue of the palate of
the frog.

'The spiral fibres can be shown to be continuous with the material of which the body
of the cell is composed as well as the straight fibre; but the former are connected with
its surface, while the latter proceeds from the more central part; so that, in the most
