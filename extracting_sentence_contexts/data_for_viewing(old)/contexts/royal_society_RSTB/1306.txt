way to interefere with the success of the experiment. Air-free water gave no bette
results, nor (whether from chance or not) gave results quite so good. In mo
cases rupture appeared ultimately to occur upon the wall of the tube. Profess
Firzceracp, and, in a written communication, Professor WorrTHINGTON, suggestec
that solid objects in air-containing water might, when this was under tension, colle¢
air upon their surfaces and so bring about rupture. Even if this was so for har
solids, such as glass—and the results of our comparative experiments did not point t
it—it appeared most improbable that it could apply to a substance so permeate
and little differentiated from the water as woody cell-wall. To test the behaviou
of this material in presence of air-containing water under tension, we enclosed chips 0
the wood of Taaus baccata, which had been boiled in water to ensure complet
wetting, in tubes and subjected them to tension by cooling. In not one experime
of many did rupture occur at the chips, the liquid appeared, in fact, to break prefe
ably anywhere else. We add particulars of the experiments. .

(1.) A cylindrical glass vessel of 328 cub. centims. capacity was washed first wi
potassium hydrate and secondly with dilute hydrochloric acid, and finally boiled fo
an hour about half filled with water. A beaker of water was also boiled for about
hour, and then let cool to the air temperature, while only covered with a she
of filter paper to keep out dust. The vessel was inserted into this while ebullitic
was going on within it, so that it drew up sufficient water from the beaker to cor
plete its filling. In sealing, a bubble of air was permitted to remain in the tubului
The volume of this bubble at atmospheric pressure was estimated at about 0°05 eu
centim. In this vessel the tension obtained by heating till the bubble disap
peared and slowly cooling, was estimated at about 2°3 atmospheres. There was 2
