area stimulated. As a general fact, it may be stated that the shoulder muscles come

the area, the muscles moving the forearm and wrist when they are applied near the

applied along the posterior border. Here it is sometimes possible also to differentiate
between the different movements of the fingers and wrist, for superiorly the exci-
