and (up to the above degree of approximation) the volume of a “ tetrahedron” on a
“sphere” in hyperspace of four dimensions. In fact, the whole theory of hyperspace
“ spherical trigonometry” needs investigation in relation to the properties of multiple
correlation. Tn our illustrations (viii.) and (ix.) will be found examples of the above formule
applied to important cases in triple and quadruple correlation in the theory
of heredity. I consider that the formule above given will cover numerous novel
applications, for many of which greater simplicity will be introduced owing to the
choice of special values for the ’s or for the correlation coeflicients,
