The signs of the differences in five of the six years are negative, whilst the difference
for the sixth year has a slight positive value. The inference to be drawn thence is that
there is ome probability that the north end of the declination-magnet points at Bombay

January to March and October to December; and the same result exactly is arrived at
if all the disturbed observations are included in the calculation of the mean values of
declination, I cannot regard the evidence as conclusive, however, for two reasons,—first,
because the obseryations at the four stations Kew, Hobarton, St. Helena; and the Cape
of Gocil Hope agree in showing that at those places the north end of the declination-

magnet points, when the sun is north of the equator, to the eastward of its mean annual
position, which is contrary to what is found for Bombay; and, 8econdly, because the
annual variations at Bombay, calculated, as in Table XXT., for each individual year, are
irregular and inconsistent with each other to an extent much exceeding the whole range
of the semiannual inequality.
