This factor increases rapidly for reverse angles larger than 60° (z <
—60°). The highest factor, of approximately 2.3, is obtained at 85°, the highest
zenith angle computed. This rapid increase can be explained by the fact that
at such angles, the observer's line of sight crosses the shadow of the mountain
for most of its trajectory into the atmosphere.
