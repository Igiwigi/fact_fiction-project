in colour.) a

interface isoline of T=3Ty in a way similar to equation (5.2). After the initial transients, the
absolute propagation speed was found to reach a value of 6.25,, whereas the density weighted
displacement speed was found to fluctuate about 1.35,. The corresponding values from the DNS
results [25] are 7S, and 1.5S,, respectively. The difference could be attributed to a number of
factors including the type of grid, resolution, type of diffusion model, etc. Overall, the results
agree well with the DNS [24,25].

6. Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a lattice Boltzmann framework to simulate reactive mixtures. The
novelty of the model lies in the fact that temperature and energy changes due to chemical reaction
are handled naturally without the need of additional ad-hoc modelling of the heat of reaction.
This was possible because of the thermodynamic consistency of the underlying multi-component
model [11], which was extended to compressible reactive mixtures. The species interaction is
modelled through the Stefanâ€”Maxwell diffusion mechanism which has been extended in this
work to accommodate the creation and destruction rates of the species due to chemical reaction.
Computational efficiency has been achieved through reduced description of energy which makes
it possible to describe the physical system by only M + 2 kinetic equations instead of 2M kinetic
equations while retaining necessary physics such as the inter-diffusion energy flux. The model
has been realized on the standard D3Q27 lattice, which not only reduces the computational costs
compared to multispeed approaches but also possesses a wide temperature range, which is crucial
for combustion applications.
