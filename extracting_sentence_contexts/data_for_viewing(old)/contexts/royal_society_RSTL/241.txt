the brain, longitudinally, the intermixture of the 'cortical and
medullary substances form the appearance called Arbor vitz,
in a perfectly natural state ; the texture of those two substances
being firm and natural. The fourth and only ventricle is unu-
sually large; and the portio mollis of the seventh pair of nerves
arises from its inside, as is usual. The anterior rounded ends
of the crura cerebri, present a mass of healthy medullary sub-
stance. The outer surface of the cerebellum is divided into
the parallel layers or folds, and those vermiform processes,
which distinguish its general character.

The narration of these appearances assists and confirms
other facts, in demonstrating, that the formation and growth
of animals in the uterus, are independent of any influence
from those parts of their brain which properly belong to sensa-
tion. We have to regret, that this animal did not live to
shew the phenomena of volitions directed to its limbs, and other
apparatus, without that intelligence from the organs of the
senses which regulates and directs the efforts of perfect animals,
The careful observance of such circumstances may, in future,
bring us to discoveries of the highest value, in that part of phy-
Sology which is now enveloped in deep mystery : the factsat
