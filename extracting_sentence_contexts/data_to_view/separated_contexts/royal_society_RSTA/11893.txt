Mr. Rowan, of the Atlas Works, Sheffield, made use of coloured glasses, two of
ultramarine blue and one of dark yellow, by which the eye was greatly assisted and
the termination of the process rendered unmistakeable. Though Lrexxae first recognised the fact that the spectrum of the Bessemer flame
was not the spectrum of carbon, nor entirely that of carbonic oxide, which gives a
continuous spectrum, it was Brunner in 1868 who first expressed the view that the

spectroscope cannot be considered as a practical indicator of the decarburization in the
Bessemer process, because the lines of the Bessemer spectrum do not belong to
carbonic oxide or to carbon, but to manganese and other elements in the pig-iron
(‘ Oesterreichische Zeitschrift fiir Berg- und Hiitten-wesen,’ vol. 16, 1868, pp. 226, 228). Next, von Licarenrets (“Ein Beitrag zur Analyse des Spectrums der Bessemer-
flamme,” ‘ Dineter’s Polytech. Journal, vol. 191, pp. 213, 215) remarked that the
nature of the several green and blue groups of lines seen in the Bessemer spectrum
was not known; they had been attributed to various substances, but with no
certainty as to their identity.
