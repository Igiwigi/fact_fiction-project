some reliable data to an interesting branch of anatomical science, I have taken the
opportunity recently afforded by the examination of the brains of numerous examples
belonging to three families of Quadrumana of making the following observyations.
The greater number of the specimens described are from animals which have died during
the past 8ummer in the Gardens of the Zoological Society. For their transmission into
my hands while in that perfectly fresh condition so essential to the success of cerebral
investigations, T am indebted to the attention of Mr. BarTLETT, the able Superintendent
of the Society's Collection.

As other considerations besides those of a purely anatomical character have been sup-
posed to be involved in inquiries of this nature, I must state at the outset that these
have been undertaken without reference to any theory as to the transmutation of species,
or origin of the human race; whateyer inferences others may draw from the facts
related, for my own part I see no reason to assign any special importance, in determining
the value of s8nch a theory, to the condition of the particular portion of the cerebral
organization now under consideration, egpecially as the general close resemblance
between the physical structure of Man and the Quadrumana has long been a matter
of common observation.

As it is to the brain of Man that the comparisons instituted in this paper chiefly refer,
it will be necessary in the first instance to call attention to certain points in the struc-
