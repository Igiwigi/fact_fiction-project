becomes less und less as the series is ascended,

In the ease of the dichlorides the compound of higher molecular weight has a
decidedly higher coefficient, This difference is no doubt alected by the same cause
which brings about the wide separation of the curves of the isomeric dichlorethanes.


FETWHEN THE VISCOSITY OF LIQUIDS AND THEIR CHEMICAL NATURE. 593

Tf etbylidene chloride he used instead of ethylene chloride, a negative difference, — 25,
as in most other series, is obtained for the effect of CH).

The fact, too, that methylene chloride is the lowest member of the series, and
contains only one carbon atam, may be important.

The large differences brought about by the values for formic acid and benzene are
farther indications of the abnormal coefficients possessed by the initial members of
homologous series.

Aleohols—This series, as is the case under every condition of comparizon, diflers
from all the others. An morement of OH, not only exercises great influence on the
Wscosity coefficient, but its effect is exeoptianal, inasmuch as the sign changes as the
Wolecular weight increases. ;

The differences between the first three members are positive; all the others are
