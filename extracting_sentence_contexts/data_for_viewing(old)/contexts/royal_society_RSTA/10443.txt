é 24. Before proceeding to the third set of equations, one substantial simplification is
ible. The various quantities that have been obtained are algebraically independent,

far as they occur as solutions of partial differential equations. But there may be
Bitrinsic relations among them owing to the original properties of the quantities which
Fhey involve; such intrinsic relations are known to exist among the differential

variants of a surface.
8 Asa matter of fact, cach of the six equations ®,, O,, Os, O,, O;, 4 ts equal to zero,
a result established* by CayLry in a somewhat different form. The six equations
that thus arise, in the case where the independent variables u, v, w correspond to a
triply orthogonal system, are the well known six relations givent by Lams.

As the six quantities ©,, ©), ©;, ©,, ©;, ©, are permanently zero, we may use this
property to simplify the equations in the next set.

The evanescence of these quantities might have been used earlier, in order to
modify some of the preceding expressions ; but no substantial advantage would have
