Tranſa#tions; which was accordingly done upon the
26th of March #752. And the grounds of their choice
are, and will continue to be, the importance or fingu-
larity of the ſubjects, or the-advantageous manner of
treating them ; without pretending to anſwer for the
certainty of the facts, or propriety/of therreaſonings,
contained in the ſeveral papers ſo publiſhed, which
muſt ſtill reſt on the credit or judgment of their re-
ſpective authors. It is likewiſe neceflary on this occaſion to remark,
that it-is an eſtabliſhed rule of the Society, to: which
they will always adhere, neves to give their opinion,
as a body, upon any ſubject, either of nature or- art,
that comes before them. And therefore the thanks,,
which are: frequently '/propored from the chair,” to: be.
given to the authors of ſuch papers, as are read at
their accuſtomed meetings, or to the perſons, through.
whoſe hands they receive them, are to be conſidered
in no other light, than as a- matter of civility, in re-
turn for the reſpe&t ſhewn to the Society by thoſe
communications.
