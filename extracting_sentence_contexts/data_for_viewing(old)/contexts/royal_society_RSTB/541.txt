As to the explanation, Wotrr does not suppose that free nitrogen is fixed by the
plants themselves ; nor does he favour the view that it was fixed by the agency of
micro-organisms. The plants may take up combined nitrogen from the air by their
leaves ; but he thinks it more probable that combined nitrogen is absorbed from the
air by the soil, and that free nitrogen is fixed within the soil under the influence of
porous and alkaline bodies. He admits that it is not explained why cereals do not
benefit by these actions as well as Papilionaceze ; and he suggests whether the greater
evaporation from their leaves causes greater aération of the soil.

Here, then, the gain of nitrogen by the Leguminose is explained in a very different
manner from that assumed by other recent experimenters. It seems to us, however,
that the undoubted fact that the Graminex, and other plants than the Papilionaces,
do not benefit by the actions supposed, excludes the supposition that Wourr’s results
with Papilionacex are to be so explained. It is true that neither in the growth of the
clover in ignited soil, nor in that of the sand-peas in the washed sand, were the
conditions such as would seem favourable for the presence, development, and agency
of micro-organisms. But if, in the experiments in free air, there was no accidental
source of combined nitrogen, it would seem that the influence of micro-organisms is at
least as probable as that of the actions which WoLrFr supposes.

Professor ArwATER made numerous experiments, both on the germination and on
the growth of peas. In eleven out of thirteen experiments on germination more or
less loss of nitrogen was observed. In all but one out of fifteen experiments on
vegetation, there was a gain of nitrogen, which was very variable in amount, and
