The size of the lobus
anterius must be due, therefore, to the number of cortical connections, but what is
the cause of this one-sided development ? In marsupials and other primitive mammals with a small lobus anterius the pons
is well developed but lies entirely anterior to the entering trigeminal nerve. There
is, in fact, a wide gap between the pons and corpus trapezoideum through which
the fifth nerve enters, and in which the commencement of the lateral lemniscus is
plainly visible (Sroxes, 1911). The trapezoid body is quite unencumbered by the
pons, and the sixth, seventh, and eighth nerves are attached to its superficial surface. This condition is also found in the majority of other primitive mammals.
