ness, in the latter it is exceedingly prolonged and gradual, occupying some four or five
Seconds in its execution, and, from its slow but continuous nature, presenting a graceful
appearance. Lastly, the difference between the two kinds of contraction is shown by
the fact that, while a spasm is gradually passing off, the ordinary rhythmical contrac-
tions may often be sceen to be superimposed on itâ€”both kinds of contraction being thus
present in the same tissue at the same time.

(5) T have thus given a somewhat fuller description of these movements than that
contained in my former paper, because, as the whole of the present section is to be occu-
pied with their consideration, it seems desirable to render a complete account of them
at the outset. Now the point with which we shall be especially concerned on the pre-
sent occasion is one which has already been alluded to incidentally, viz. that in the case
of Staurophora laciniata it is only stimulation of certain parts of the organisgm which
has the effect of throwing it into a s8pasm. These parts are the margin (including the
tentacles) and the courses of the four radial tubes (including the polypite, which in this
species is spread oyer the radial tubes). This limitation, however, is not invariable ; for
