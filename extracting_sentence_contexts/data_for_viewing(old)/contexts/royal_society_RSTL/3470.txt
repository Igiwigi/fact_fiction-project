Mr. Fox's series of intensity results in France, Switzerland, and Germany, were
obtained in the summer of 1838, with a four-inch needle deflected by the weights
Specified in the subjoined Table. The angles are half the sum of the deflections to
the right and to the left, and are corrected for temperature at the rate of 2' for one
centesimal degree, determined experimentally for the actual angles. In reference to
these observations, (and to those of the dip in the Table in page 137.) Mr. Fox re-
marks, that he always waited till the needle was at rest, and then repeatedly moved
it, by turning a little the concentric disk and bracket from behind, reading off again
and again when the needle had settled after the application of gentle friction. This
he generally did at least three times before he noted the results, s0 that in fact the
