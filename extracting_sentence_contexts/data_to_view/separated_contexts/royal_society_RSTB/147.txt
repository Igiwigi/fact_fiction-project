General Statement. The examination of the comparative relations of the carotid and subclavian arteries
in the different groups of Vertebrates throws additional light on the manner in which
these vessels are developed in the Bird. The chief difficulty is to be met with in
connection with the nomenclature, and is to be accounted for by the fact that
accurate comparisons between the arteries of different groups have not been made,
observers having often named vessels from their position in one form without
reference to their relations in others. This is particularly the case with reference to
the carotid system. The carotid system consists of the following parts:â€”(1) The third arch ; (2) its
dorsal prolongation towards the head ; (3) its ventral prolongation towards the head.
