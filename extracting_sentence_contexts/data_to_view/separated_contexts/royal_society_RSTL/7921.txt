Mandible of Chiromys Madagascariensis, natural
8ize (Zool. Trans. vol. v. pl. 20. fig. 9, Memoir of Mandible of © Plagiaulaz Becklesii, magnified four
January 14, 1862). diameters” (after FaLcoxtr, XI. pl. 34. fig. 1).
dence of the herbivority of the gnawing Lemur and his comparison of its mandible with
that of Plagiaulaz, admits that * the condyle looks still more depressed in Plagiaulasz
Becklesii ; but this is, in part, owing to the inflected margin of the angle being broken
off in the fossil, while it is entire and salient in the recent form, thus elevating the con-
dyle above the lower plane of the ramus, and leading to an appearance of a greater
amount of difference than exists in nature”. Here we are at issue on a matter of fact. I affirm that the condyle (6, fig. 10) in Plagi-
aulax would not be 80 elevated above the lower plane of the ramus if the angle (a, fig. 10)
were entire and salient, because the saliency has an inward, not a downward, direc-
tion. The correspondence in this respect, as well as in the low position of condyle, of
Plagiaulaz with the carnivorous Thylacoleo, Dasyures, and Thylacines, and its difference
from the herbivorous marsupials (fig. 6) and larvivorous Lemur (fig. 9) is as clearly
demonstrated in the Purbeck fossils, as if the inflected angle had received no fracture
whatever.
