In turn D is determined by the monopole hopping frequency vp. In a simple
lattice diffusion approximation, we may write [12]

av

where a is the diamond lattice constant (the numerical factor of 6 may be modified
very slightly when the fact that a monopole may only hop in three out of four
local directions is accounted for [17]). Using the definitions Q=2u/a where uw

is the rare-earth magnetic moment, and yc = MoM?/3 VokT,, equations (3.1), (3.2)
and (3.5) may be rearranged to give

D= (3.5)

v= Quor, (3.6)

where g=Xxc/xr =4 in Ryzhkin’s theory but is more generally weakly

temperature dependent and varies between g=1 at high temperature and g = 2
