Similar patterns have been reported from a number
of undated ESA sites in western Central Africa (figure 1c),

among which are the Lunda-Norte sites in northeastern 6. Conclusion

Angola [74]. Comparable technological trends have been The significance of this discovery lies in the fact that it is
observed on other Central African ESA sites such as Baboun- the first time that an ESA site has been dated on the Atlantic
gué in the Sangha River Basin in Central African Republic edge of the Congo Basin, a vast region where research is not

these remain undated, the site of Kontcha offers good accessibility and complicates logistics. Despite hostile climatic conditions that prevent the good
conservation of open-air Pleistocene sites, the lithic artefacts
discovered in the alluvial deposit of Elarmékora have been
dated as old as 650 ka at a minimum by the use of cosmogenic
1Be and *°Al pairs.
