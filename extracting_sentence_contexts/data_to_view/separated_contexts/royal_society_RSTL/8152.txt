Five species
(Cidaris affinis, Echinus melo, Toxopneustes brevispinosus, Psammechinus microtubercu-
latus, and Schizaster canaliferus) are recognized members of the Lusitanian and Mediter-
ranean faunz, and seven (Porocidaris purpurata, Phormosoma placenta, Calveria hystris,


|

 C. fenestrata, Neolampas rostellata, Pourtalesia Jeffreysi, and P. phyale) are forms
which have been for the first time brought to light during the late deep-sea dredging-
operations, whether on this or on the other side of the Atlantic : there seems little
doubt that these must be referred to the abyssal fauna, upon whose confines we are
only now beginning to encroach. Three of the most remarkable generic forms, -Ca/-
veria, Neolampas, and Pourtalesia, have been described by Prof. ALEXANDER AGASSIZ
among the results of the deep-dredging operations of Count PouRTALEs in the Strait of
Florida, showing a wide lateral distribution ; and even a deeper interest attaches to the
fact that while one family type, the EcurxoTuuRIDE, has been hitherto known only
in a fossil state, the entire group find nearer allies in the extinct faunz of the Chalk, or
Sf the earlier Tertiaries, than in that of the present day.
