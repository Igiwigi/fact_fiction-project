If therefore we equate the coefficients ot every term on the two sides of the
equation, we shall have found a solution of equation (xvii.), p. 421, inasmuch as this
equation is now satisfied identically for every value of g, 7, and s.

The process of equating these coefficients leads to a series of differential equations,
in which the time-rate of increase of every coefficient is given explicitly in terms of
the other coeflicients and of h. If, therefore, we suppose the coefficients to vary with
the time in the manner given by these equations, the value of x so obtained will be a
solution of equation (xvii.) for all time. Since the equations involve h, and h varies
with the time, one further equation is required before we can express the co-ordinates
at any time in terms of the initial values of the co-ordinates and the time. This
additional equation is supplied by the fact that N, the total number of molecules,
remains constant.

We have (see ยง 23, equation (xiii) ),
N= \uF 2 Veoreonge dpdPdu. . . . . (xviii),

and the equation dN/dt = 0 is the equation required, With the help of the other
equations, it can be written so as to give dh/dt explicitly as a function of h and the
other co-ordinates.
