an angle 0 with v, and in a plane at right angles to a, is

ie (58.) Concluding Remarks. —IT have now said enough, I think, to explain the
nature of the proposed symbolization, and the general rules which regulate the
Zapplication of the two translation-products. I have based the whole theory simply
ana exclusively on the conception of translation, taking my clue from the three
Suuggesting instances, the parallelogram, the couple, and work, As regards the lateral
Zefect of translation, the theory is nothing but a general development of our geometrical
notion of multiplication ; for what is a rectangle, ABCD, considered apart from
Earithmetical measure, but the effect or product of the translation of Fig. 24.
