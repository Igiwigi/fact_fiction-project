In other words, the situation of the nerve-cells,
not that of the nerve-fibres, marks the segmental position of the sensory nerve. Grow-
ing out from the ganglion-cells, its fibres wander distally into skin and muscles, and
these trespass, as I have pointed out, considerably beyond the limits of their proper
metamere, for they considerably overlap. Centripetally they extend even more
boldly into regions outside their original metamere, in fact, into segments quite remote. A similar arrangement exists in motor nerves, but I* and A. S.
