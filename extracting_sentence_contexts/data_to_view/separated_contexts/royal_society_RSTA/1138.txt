The latter are related to the famous O(Ma’) errors that are obtained
in the definition of the viscous stress tensor [42]. Hence, the LSA of the DVBE is able to capture
the weakly compressible deficiency of the D2Q9 velocity discretization, as previously reported
for the D3Q19 lattice [67]. In fact, previous studies showed that by adopting higher-order velocity
discretizations, the LSA further leads to shear and acoustic waves that do not suffer anymore
from compressibility errors [12,78]. If we now consider results obtained with methods that are supposed to restore the Galilean
invariance of standard lattices, such as the cascaded and the cumulant-based LBMs [18,19,26],
