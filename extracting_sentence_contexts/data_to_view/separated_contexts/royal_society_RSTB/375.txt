The larve which were found to have pupated by 12 p.m.,
September 4, cannot have passed as much as 13 hours on the frame, and most of them
must have had a very much shorter period of time. The larve of B. and D., on the
other hand, seem to have passed the whole of Stage III. on the frame, and one of the
most curious and exceptional things in all the experiments recorded in this paper is
the fact that the larvee of D., surrounded entirely by black for the whole stage, should
be lighter than those of A. or D., which were also partially exposed to gilt, and
had been on the frame for a much shorter time in nearly all cases. In other respects,
however, an analysis of the few results in which the influences had worked for an
adequate period of time is very satisfactory. | Ver
