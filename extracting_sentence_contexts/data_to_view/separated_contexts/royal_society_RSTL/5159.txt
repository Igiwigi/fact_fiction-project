In microscopic characters the osteal cells closely resemble the granular cells of
temporary cartilage, s0 closely indeed, that the latter when detached from the car-
tilage could not well be distinguished from them. They are for the most part sphe-
rical or oval in form, and lie on the surface of the growing bone in a crowded mass,
held together by an intervening and apparently structureless matrix (Plate IX. fig.
27b). Here and there we find a cell which bas accumulated about itself an outer
investment of transparent tissue, and has in fact become developed into a lacunal
cell destined to become a lacuna*. These points are illustrated in fig. 29 6.
