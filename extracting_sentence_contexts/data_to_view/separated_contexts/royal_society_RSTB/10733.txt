The universality of this classical notion of sex-specific
mammalian reproductive strategies was subsequently modi-
fied by recognizing that it can also pay for male mammals
to be choosy under certain circumstances [13,77—80], if only
by strategically allocating sperm [81], and that females can
also compete with each other over mates and reproductive
opportunities [1,82—86]. Hence, the fundamental sex roles
of mammals are obviously constrained by internal, biologi-
cal traits, but there are also interesting cases of intra- and
interspecific variation in sex roles, including paternal care
[87,88]. Thus, mammalian sex roles are generally, but not
invariably constrained by a fundamental life-history trait,
and models attempting to predict this variation among
mammalian species need to take this fact into account. Moreover, species-specific life-history traits, such as the
length of gestation and lactation, can also affect sex roles
through their impact on OSR. Specifically, a bias in the
OSR can create frequency-dependent selection favouring
increased mate guarding and reduced parental care by the
sex facing more intense completion for mates [4,89,90].
