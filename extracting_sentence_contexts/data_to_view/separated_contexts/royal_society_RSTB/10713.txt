Uganda in 2000-2001 with 425 cases and 224 deaths (Sudan strain has also been identified in pigs with asymptomatic
strain) and DRC (Kikwit) in 1995 with 315 cases and 250 deaths transmission to at least six humans in contact with pigs

(Zaire strain) [6]. reported in the Philippines [6]. Box 1. Ebola virus disease—key facts about the virus, illness, management and prevention. (Adapted from CDC [9].)

¢ Outbreak emergence =

— EVD is a zoonotic infection—outbreaks begin in humans following a spillover event from an animal to human.
— The animal reservoir for Ebola remains uncertain, but current evidence suggests that bat species may be a natural reservoir,
with other species acting as intermediate hosts, particularly non-human primates [10]. The evidence to support this includes:
(i) Experimental inoculation of animals epidemiologically linked with outbreaks of Ebola virus demonstrated viral

replication in fruit and insectivorous bats without fatalities [11] =

(ii) Trapping studies have found wild bats with evidence of Ebola infection and immunity (RNA fragments and $s
Ebola-specific antibodies) in areas which have had human and non-human primate Ebola outbreaks [12]. However, s

live Ebola virus has never been isolated from a bat in nature, which makes the picture less clear [13] ~

(iii) Ebola virus has been isolated from other animals, including non-human primates and duikers, but these species =
appear to be unsuitable reservoirs because they have high case fatality rates during outbreaks [10,13].
