Of the two ketones, the symmetrical compound has slightly the lower temperature.

At slope 0,987 the temperature differences obtained on making comparisons of the
L given in the preceding tables are practically of the same order as are there
esented, This result follows from the fact.that the ratios of the absolute tem-
