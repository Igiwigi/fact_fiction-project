Considering re-formulating the Paris equation, see equations (2.2) and (2.3), in terms of G
rather than K, then at first sight the most obvious and corresponding parameter against which


to plot the measured rate of the FCG, da/dN, is the range of the applied energy release-rate, AG. However, as shown in equation (2.1), K is proportional to VG. Indeed, recent work, for example
by Jones et al. [24,26,27], Rans et al. [36], Pascoe et al. [37], Simon et al. [38] and Yao et al. [25,39-41],
has confirmed that the logical extension of the Paris FCG rate equation in terms of G, rather than
K, is in fact to express da/dN as a function of AVG, where

AVG = /Ginax — VGmins (2.4)

where Gmax and Gin are the maximum and minimum values of the applied energy release-rate
in the fatigue cycle, respectively. The values of Gmax and Gmin may, of course, be calculated from
the maximum and minimum loads, Pmax and Pmin, respectively, in the fatigue cycle and the R-
ratio may be defined by R = Pmin/Pmax. (The value of the R-ratio may also be given in terms of
the maximum and minimum displacements, 5max and min, respectively, and the R-ratio may now
be defined by R = 3min/émax)-

The Paris equation, either in terms of AK or AVG, gives a linear expression when plotted
as logarithmic da/dN versus logarithmic AVG. However, while the central portions of the
FCG relationships that are experimentally measured do invariably follow this linear expression
relatively closely, the experimental results for the FCG relationships over the full range of values
are usually sigmoidal in shape, for example, see figures 1, 4, 7 and 8 below.
