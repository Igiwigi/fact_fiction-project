Climate engineering, if it works
and is used wisely, would reduce the climate risk from—and therefore the marginal social cost
of—additional emissions. This would mean that the morally optimal level of mitigation, in the
presence of effective, wisely used climate engineering, would be lower than the optimal level
of mitigation in the absence of climate engineering. That is, the fact that me <img does not
necessarily mean that (i11ce, Ace, Cce, Sce) Yields a worse outcome than would (119, 49, Co, So). Thus,
if research led us to expect climate engineering could be used wisely and effectively, we might be
justified in reducing mitigation efforts. The wisdom of reducing mitigation depends partly on how much of the reduced climate risk
comes from CDR and how much from SRM.
