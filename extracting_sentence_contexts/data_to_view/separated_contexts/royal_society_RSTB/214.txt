Although we here give a list of the localities at which we have observed combined
simultaneous movement of all the toes, we wish most particularly to remark that, on
a@ priori grounds, it is not to be expected that such simultaneous movements should be
as constantly localised as those of a highly specialised segment, like the hallux;
further, we wish to draw attention to the fact that it may well happen that occa-
sionally in those localities where the movement of the toes succeeds that of the
hallux the time-interval may be so short that the movements are practically synchro-
nous. For example, we have several times cbtained, first, synchronous movements of
all the digits; and, later, by carefully repeated minimal stimulation, discovered that
occasionally there was a distinct interval between the movement of the hallux and
the rest of the digits. It might have seemed justifiable to ignore those instances
where the time-interval was exceedingly short, but we have thought it more accurate to
record all the movements exactly as they occurred.
