“Immunity against a third infection.

**(1) Accumulation of immunizing effects.

“* Most of the mosaic diseases applied in the writer’s experiments give no immunity
against infections with the white mosaic or the ringspot necrosis. But after a second
infection with the ordinary mosaic the plants with e.g. the severe mosaic or the distort-
ing mosaic will not attract the other viruses on a third infection. The explanation is to
be found in the fact that the ordinary mosaic will enter into all parts of these plants.
...We have to suppose that the plant cell with different viruses keeps the immunizing
effect of each of these. By the following data it appears probable that these immunizing
effects of two viruses in one plant strengthen each other. Plants with a combination
of the severe mosaic and the ringspot necrosis as also plants with the distorting mosaic
and the ringspot necrosis are not susceptible to the white mosaic, whereas none of
the three itself affords immunity against the white mosaic.
