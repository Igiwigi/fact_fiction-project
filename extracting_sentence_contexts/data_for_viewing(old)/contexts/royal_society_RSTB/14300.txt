to find in the offspring two sorts of individuals in approximately
equal numbers, under normal conditions, that exhibit marked
differences in structure. A careful consideration will suggest
that nothing but sexual characters thus divides the members of
a species into two well-defined groups, and we are logically
forced to the conclusion that the peculiar chromosome has
