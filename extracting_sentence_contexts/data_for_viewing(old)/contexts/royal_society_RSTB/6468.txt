and laterally (figs. 18A, 18B) with the general ectoderm of the arm, and orally
(fig. 17) with the distal end of the nerve cord, where it is expanded into the optic
cushion. The aboral and lateral connexions are effected through lappet-like
foldings of the ectoderm (figs. 17, 18A, 18B, ab. lap., lat. lap.), which form a hood
within which the tentacle can be partially retracted.

The ectoderm of the azygos tentacle is made up of epithelial cells with supporting
fibres, sensory elements, and glands, and is covered by a thin cuticle. Glands are
not numerous on the azygos tentacle and are practically absent from the sucker.
The primary sense cells are very asymmetrically distributed, for while the oral and
lateral faces of the sucker are supplied with sensory endings in even greater numbers
than are the suckers of the ambulatory podia, the aboral ectoderm is practically
devoid of them. To this uneven distribution may be related the fact that the
starfish, in life, bends the ray aborally and so presents only the oral face of the

tentacle for the reception of stimuli, the aboral surface being thus hidden under
the hood,

Consequent on the asymmetrical disposition of the sensory elements is an uneven
development of the subepithelial fibrillar plexus. The thickness of the epithelium
and plexus is indicated by the blackened areas in figs. 17, 18A, and 18B. Fig. 17
clearly shows that the plexus is very much more extensive on the oral than on the
