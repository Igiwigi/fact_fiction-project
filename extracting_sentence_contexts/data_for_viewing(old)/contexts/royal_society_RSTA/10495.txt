[ Note, added June 30, 1903.—Since the present paper was written Mr. H. A. Witson
has made some experiments on the conductivity produced by hot platinum at low
pressures, in which he finds that by carefully treating the wire the current can be
reduced to about one two hundred thousandth of the value found by the author at
the same temperature. Mr, Writson also shows that the current is greatly increased
by admitting hydrogen into the apparatus, and concludes that the high values found
in this paper are due to hydrogen absorbed by the wire, which is only given off very
slowly, if at all, by mere heating.

These results are not, however, inconsistent with the view that the effects are due
to electrons shot out of the metal. ‘To obtain the observed facts we have only to
suppose that the occlusion of hydrogen diminishes the work which a corpuscle has to
do in escaping from the surface. Mr, Wrirson’s own results are in agreement with
this theory, for he finds that raising the pressure of hydrogen from 0 to 133 millims.
reduces the value of the work in question in the ratio of 155 to 36. It might be
thought that on this view the constant A which determines the number of ions per
cub. centim. of platinum should be independent of the pressure of the hydrogen
outside. The numbers found by Mr. Wixson do not support this supposition, but the
numerous practical and theoretical difficulties demand that little weight should be
attached to the difference.

Tt is possible that Mr. Witson’s process of removing hydrogen from a wire by
oxidation may, as it were, overshoot the mark by leaving an electrical double layer
