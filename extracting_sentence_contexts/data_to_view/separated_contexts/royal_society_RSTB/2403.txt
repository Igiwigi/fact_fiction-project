They show that the mixed
â€˜& condition of the sorus, with no definite orientation of the sporangia, and with the
6 annulus not complete, but interrupted at the insertion of the stalk, is the type for
& the bulk of the Leptosporangiate Ferns. This being so, a correspondingly greater
-2 importance must be attached to the fact that in certain tribes the sequence is
a regularly basipetal, the orientation definite, and the annulus complete, and oblique in
2 position. The occurrence of exceptions, such as that in Plagiogyria, cannot in my
S opinion be admitted as discounting the weight of these facts. If, as I shall suggest, the
& Ferns which have an oblique annulus, and a definite orientation of the sporangia,
4 produced in basipetal succession, gave rise to those with vertical annulus, indefinite
& orientation, and mixed sori, what could be more natural than that the transition from
3 the one type to the other should in some cases have been incompletely carried out ?
3 In such exceptions as these I see rather a support of my view, than a reason for

discounting such characters for purposes of comparison with a view to tracing probable
& lines of descent. MorPHoLoGy OF THE Sorus.
