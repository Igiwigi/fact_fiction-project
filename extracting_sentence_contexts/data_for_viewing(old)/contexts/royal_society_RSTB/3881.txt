& As regards the recoveries in Kitvineron’s animals, he puts forward as evidence
§ chiefly the ability of the animal to walk on the plantar surface of the foot. Where
E he had retained the external popliteal for the supply, the result was unsatisfactory,
fal but where he had made the internal popliteal the nerve of supply, he reported the

recovery as satisfactory. In 139 days one of the dogs did not walk on the dorsum
of the foot at all, and a similar result was recorded in his other experiment of the
same kind.

In connection with this it is important to bear in mind how difficult it is to judge
of recoveries of voluntary movements in the case of the hind limb. This is due to the
fact that, although the entire hind-limb below the, knee is completely paralysed, the
animal continues to make use of the limb for walking. This I found to be the case
in a former research (6), in which the sciatic nerve was divided at the level of the
trochanter. Practically the only indication of paralysis which is in evidence is the

turning back of the paw, so that the animal rests on the dorsal surface of the
paw, and, having no sensation, scrapes along until the skin of this part of the
paw is rubbed off. If precautions are taken to fix the paw in position with a
bandage, the defect does not occur. In some dogs the paw, even soon after the
section, is not invariably placed with the dorsal surface down. This was also
