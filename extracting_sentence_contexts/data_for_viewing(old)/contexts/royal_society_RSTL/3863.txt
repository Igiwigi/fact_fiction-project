acquire a considerable preponderance in bulk over those of the periphery. Subse-
quently to these changes the cells assume a special arrangement, they become aggre-
gated into a small oblong mass, which is curved at each end, and is not unlike the
embryo of higher animals, while a space is formed between the trunk of the little
mass and the membrane of the egg. The next stage would seem to be the rupture
of the egg-membrane and the expulsion of the embryo, but this process I have not
observed in operation, although I have seen on the one hand embryos which ap-
peared to be just released from their inyesting membrane, while on the other I have
detected egg-membranes evidently cast off by ecdysis. In some few of the ova I
have observed adipose cells, some large and some small, mingled with the germinal
cells.

It is a curious fact, that in the development of the Entozoon folliculorum, a re-
markable embryonic form is met with which is peculiar to the long variety of the
animal, and is not met with in the shorter kind. This embryonic body is elongated,
rounded and bulky at one extremity ; smaller, somewhat tapering and blunt-pointed
at the other, and enlarged towards the middle by the development from one of its
sides of two oval-shaped prominences which subside gradually into the larger end
and join the smaller end, either at a right or at a receding angle. This peculiarity of
form enables us to divide the embryo into a body, which comprises the larger end
and these two oval prominences, and a tail, which is the smaller and shorter end ;
the principal changes in its form taking place, in the course of development, being
the elongation of the tail and the enlargement or snbsidence of the oval prominences,
The dimensions of the embryo are zz to 23+ of an inch in the long, and ++ to 35
in the short diameter, In structure the embryo presents a close analogy with the
