Similarly, the radial structure has not yet featured much in research on electron
vortex beams [35]. Although much of electron vortex research is inspired by concepts and techniques in optical
vortex beams, due to the equivalence of scalar Maxwell equations in free space and the
Schr√©dinger equation for a free particle [17-20], electron vortex beams are characterized by
a number of different properties [20]. These are attributable to the fact that electrons have
finite mass, carry electric charge and have half-integer intrinsic angular momentum (spin). Furthermore, there are considerable differences in scale. Electron vortex beams created inside
contemporary electron microscopes have de Broglie wavelengths in the picometre range and
are therefore capable of probing much smaller features than is possible using optical vortex
beams for which the typical wavelength is in the hundreds of nanometres range (visible light).
