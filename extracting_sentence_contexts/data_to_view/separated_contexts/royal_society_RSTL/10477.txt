Thus the
section S, having been determined, it is easy to ascertain the section after any amount
of stretching. For example, the section of the wire last used was before stretching
-0183 8quare centim., and the resistances before and after the stretching were 1-056
and 1080 respectively, therefore the section of the wire after stretching would be
1-080?

the means between the resistances observed at the commencement and gnd of the
times during which the velocities of increase were noted, and the wire was allowed
to run down for some time (about 20 minutes) before the observations of the velocities
of increase commenced,

larger, and we might expect to find some relation between the decrease of velocity
of increase of resistance and the difference between the breaking-load and the load
actually on the wire. A further examination of the results given in Table XII. shows
that a relation does exis6 of an extremely simple nature ; in fact, if we denote the
breaking-load and the actual load on the wire by P and p respectively, the decrease
per unit of the velocity of increase of resistance is inversely proportional to Pâ€”p. The value of P was carefully determined by loading pieces of the wire by moderate
amounts at a time, and allowing each load to remain on the wire ome ten minutes
before each further addition, and measuring the diameter close to the point of breakage
by means of a wire-gauge graduated to '01 millim. The mean of several trials gave a
value for P of 2625 kilogs. per square centimetre.
