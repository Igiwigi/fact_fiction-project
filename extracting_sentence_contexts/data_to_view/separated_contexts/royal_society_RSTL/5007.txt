The years which Dr. Lawoxr infers from the Munich observations to have been
those which include the half-period of the inequality of the diurnal range, (or that
portion of the period which is comprised between the epochs of minimum and maxi-
mum,) are precisely the same years over which my discussion of the disturbances
has extended, and from which I have been led to infer the probable existence of a
periodical inequality in those phenomena also, having the very same epochs of mini-
mum and maximum. Dr. Lamont confines himself entirely to the diurnal inequality
of the Declination, leaving untouched the subject of the disturbances (or, as they are
more usually termed in Germany, the magnetic storms). Whether the progressive increase 80 distinctly marked in the two classes of phe-
nomena between the years 1843 and 1848 be or be not the result of causes which
bave a periodical action, in a cycle which may be either of regular or of variable
duration, the fact of the progressive increase being concurrent in both classes is of
no slight importance. It tends to indicate a causal connection suþsisting between
the disturbances and the diurnal variation ; which latter, in addition to the laws
which point directly or indirectly to the sun as the origin of its every-day phenomena,
has other phases which mark unmistakeably, and at stations very variously situated
in geographical and magnetical respects, the equinoxes as epochs of periodical change. The investigation, of which the results are contained in this paper, has 5hown that the
disturbances have also a law of diurnal action, depending like that of the regular
