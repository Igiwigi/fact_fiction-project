two fixed points x‘L, the FFT calculation of the frequency shows no peaks, i.e. no periodicity. For
the rest of the regions, it is important to notice that the amplitude does not correspond to the peak-
to-peak amplitude A as before. On the contrary, this amplitude M is calculated as xy — x*, where
xm is the maximum amplitude value and x* is the stable fixed point. To better show the difference
between the amplitudes A and M we have depicted figure 3. In the legend of the panels, we show
the values of the maximum amplitude, Mmax, of the peak and the corresponding frequency, @max,
which is the frequency of the delay-induced oscillations.

Now, we want to go further and explore the effect of the time delay on the dynamics when
the damping yu # 0. In figure 1b,c, we can observe the amplitude variation with t for the damping
parameter values 4. = 0.02 and py = 0.04. As in the case 4 =0 described above, a similar pattern
of regions for the amplitude versus t is observed, though for higher values of « the dynamics
changes. As a matter of fact, we can see how the high-amplitude oscillations, corresponding to
Region IV, either disappear and the system remains at rest at a low energy as in the case 4 = 0.04
or it happens for a few t values as in the case jz = 0.02. To stress out this damping effect, we show
in figure 1d a zoom of Region IV for the 4 = 0.02 case.

In order to provide analytical support for the numerical results presented above, we perform a
linear stability analysis [17,18] for the fixed points x* = x, = +3.606. Even though the analysis
