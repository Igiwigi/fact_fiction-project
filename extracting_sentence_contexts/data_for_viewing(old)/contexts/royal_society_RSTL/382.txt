each brain was invested, in the usual way, by its own proper
coverings; but the dura mater which covered the cerebrum of
the upper brain, adhered firmly to/ the dura mater of the lower
brain: the two brains were therefore separate and distinet,
having a complete partition between them, formed by an union
of the dure matres.

When the contents of the double $skull were taken out, and
this union of the dure matres more particularly examined, a
number of large arteries and veins were Seen passing through
it, making a free communication between the blood yessels of
the two brains. 'This/is a fact of gonsiderable importance, as it
