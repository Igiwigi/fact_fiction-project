The summary of the facts of these crossing experiments with ¢ snails is then
(1) E-ness has a similar relation to A-ness as K-ness, 7.e., E-ness behaves as a reces-
sive ;
(2) H-dextrals are genetically equivalent to E-sinistrals and have no genetic dex-
trality. (9) The character of the E and K broods which appear in F', Fy and Fy, of x x © and
« x « erosses.—The precise character of the segregating recessive in A x E crosses is
of considerable importance in trying to come to some conclusion as to the nature of
E-ness. The chief question is—Does the E-ness put into the cross reappear as such ?
