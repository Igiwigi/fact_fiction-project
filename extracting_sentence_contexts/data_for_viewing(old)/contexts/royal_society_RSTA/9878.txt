When the molecules repel one another according to the inverse fifth power of the
distance, the last equation becomes

ul hy = 6/ 90,
which was obtained by MAXWELL.

Experiment shows that the second formula (generally known as SuTHERLAND’S
formula) agrees far better with the actual facts than the others. MaxweE..’s two
hypothetical laws, « « 6" and «0, are obeyed (even approximately) by very few gases.
The law »« 6 (where s = (n+3)/2 (n—1)) represents the variation much better in most
cases, but even this applies only over a small range of temperature, after which a new
value of n is required. On the other hand, SurHERLAND’s formula applies universally
so far as it has been tested.t It will be sufficient to mention the cases of helium and
hydrogen. Scurrr§ gives tables showing that the law agrees with the observations
of these gases from —60° C. to 185° C.; below —60° C. the agreement ceases to be
good. Thus this evidence tends to confirm the hypothesis that the molecules behave
for our purpose like attracting spheres.

The value of C has been shown in Part II. (pp. 457-460) to be a multiple of the
mutual potential of two molecules in contact with one another. This was shown by
