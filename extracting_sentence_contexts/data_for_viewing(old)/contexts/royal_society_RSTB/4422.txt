Text-Fia. 1.—A comparison of the arrangeme nt of the ovulate cones in the new species and in B. Morierei,
both natural size. A, B. albianus sp. noy. The part filled in with unbroken lines represents the part
of the cone preserved in the specimen, the dotted lines indicate the probable extension of the actual
cone. Lines A to G represent the series of transverse sections, and area AR the longitudinal sections
on which the restoration is based. B, B. Morierei. View of the cone taken from LiGNIER’s
description (1894). :

Judging from the ordinary type of Bennettites cone the fact that the seeds are all
cut transversely would make it appear as though the sections must have been cut
tangentially to the surface of the cone, but the longitudinal sections of the stalks show
the impossibility of this. Taking into consideration all the structures revealed by the
sections, it is clear that the transverse series is really transverse to the cone. As the
stalks were all running nearly vertical and the seeds all standing upright, we must be
dealing with the top of the cone, which, as WIELAND (1906) showed, is the only place
where the seed-stalks are vertical and the seeds upright. W1eLAND mentions that
the cones of the group are “egg-shaped” and the lateral seed-stalks curve outwards,
carrying the seeds at an angle. As the arrangement of seeds, stalks and inter-
seminal scales is identical in the present new species with that found in other members
of the group, one must assume in it also the existence of a symmetrical cone
built on a broadly similar plan. In that case, the minimum size it must have had
