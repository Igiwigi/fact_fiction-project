90 PROFESSOR W. C. WILLIAMSON ON THE ORGANISATION

of this plant; e, the outermost cortex, composed, in transverse sections, of radiating
bands of sclerenchyma, g, alternating with parenchymatous areas, f At k, k we find
two bundles of tracheids, like those at d, forming the centre of the cortical structures
of a petiole of Rachiopteris aspera, 7, 7, which petiole is organically united to the
cortex e of the Lyginodendron. The two bundles k, & are assuming the oblique
relative positions seen in the similar bundles of the free petiole of 2. aspera, repre-
sented in fig, 2. Other sections in my cabinet, similar to fig. 1, demonstrate the
same facts, viz., that the pairs of bundles, fig. 1, d, which form so characteristic a
feature of transverse sections of the middle cortex of Lyginodendron Oldhamium, pass
outwards, through the outer cortex, to become the trachegal* bundles of the petioles
of the plant, and which petioles I had previously designated Rachiopteris aspera. I may
state that my friend Grar Soums-Lausacn, who has obtained numerous specimens
of the Lyginodendron associated with others of Rachiopteris aspera from a locality
on the continent, agrees with me in the conclusion at which I have arrived respecting
their unity. The more perfect specimens of the Lyginodendron obtained during the
last seventeen years have thrown yet further light upon those figured in 1873. In
the latter, as at fig. 1, ¢, no traces of the middle bark were preserved ; but examples
from Halifax, for which I am indebted to my friends Mr. Cas and Mr. Spencer, of
Halifax, have supplied what was wanting. Fig. 3 is a transverse section in which
this inner cortex, ¢, is shown to consist of a zone of extremely delicate, thin-walled
