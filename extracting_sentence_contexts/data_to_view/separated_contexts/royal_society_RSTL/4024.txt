That the correspondence should
not have been exact, may be more readily explained, when we consider that the only
generally practicable mode of estimating soda is an indirect one, and therefore liable
to some degree of uncertainty. In the few instances where the amount of chlorine was more than proportionate to
that of the sodium, it was thought consistent with analogy to regard that portion of
the former which was in excess, as held in combination with the vegetable alkali, or
as representing an equivalent weight of chloride of potassinm. This mode of stating the resnlts may appear objectionable, as bleading theory with
fact, but my reason for adopting it is, that it points at an important general conclu-
sion, which it is hoped future inquiries will either negative or confirm, namely that
the base of the soda found in plants commonly enters them in a state of combination
with chlorine, being derived from the common salt, taken up, but not decomposed,
by the organs of the plant. Such an inference indeed cannot be adopted by those who receive the analyses
given by SPRENGEL as correct, for in many of these large quantities of soda are stated

* This double chloride is readily decompoxsed, if first rubbed up with mercury, which flies off along with the
chlorine in the form of calomel, when heated.

+ It seems a defect in the analyses reported by SyrexGEr, that this ingredient is never mentioned in them ;
for although it may not be present as such in the crop, yet its amount in the ash probably represents that of the
organic acids existing in the plant previously to its being burnt, and hence the proportion which it bears in

different samples of the same =pecies to the phosphoric and other mineral acids, may tend to indicate the rela-

tion subsisting between the amount of organic and of inorganic matter, arising from the mode of culture or
other circumstances,

as having been detected ; but, without presuming to bring forward the analyses made
in my laboratory as in themselyes sufficient to justify the public in rejecting the
former as inaccurate, I may be permitted to observe, that it is much more easy to
conceive that the amount of soda present may have been overrated, than that it should
have been estimated below its real amount, supposing anything like an equality of
8kill and attention on the part of the operator.
