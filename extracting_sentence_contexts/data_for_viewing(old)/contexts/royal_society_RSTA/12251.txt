a=] Therefore, weight of residual alcohol alone = 0°92
S Hence the volume of the the mercury alone = 56°5 cub, centims., and the volume of the residual
a alcohol alone = 1:15 eub. centims.
2 The volume of the alcohol used in the stretching experiments was 58°5 cub. centims., therefore
585
& == 50°6, and n —1= 49-6.
a The observed recession of the mercury (a) = 7-22 millims. of tube, as already stated in the text:
A = 22'7 millims, of tube, as read off from the line in the diagram,

| %m = ‘273 millims. of tube (deduced from the value of the compressibility of mercury given in
Lupron’s tables, viz., — per 10° grms, per sq. centim., and the fact that rotor of the

volume of mercury employed = ioe of 1513 millim. of the tube).
Hence
— 50°6 99 _ 90°6 - , 22:7
"= i596 * 722 96 * 13 es
= 7°36 — 0-278 — 0-456.

= 6°626 millims. of tube.
