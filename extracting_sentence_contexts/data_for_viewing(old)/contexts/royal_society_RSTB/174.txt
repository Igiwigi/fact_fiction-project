motor region as if they were sharply marked off from one another, there is no distinct evidence that
this is really the case; but, on the contrary, if we are to accept the results of excitation (and, according to
Lucrant, they are confirmed in this particular by the results of localised ablation), there are no such sharp
lines of demarcation, but every centre and area overlaps to a greater or less extent the surrounding areas.

+ More precise details regarding the character of the movements evoked on excitation of the several
parts of each area are given by Professor Scuirer in an article ‘‘ Ueber die motorischen Rindencentren
des Affengehirns” in ‘ Beitriige zur Physiologie, C. Lupwic gewidmet,’ Leipzig, 1887.

area stimulated. As a general fact, it may be stated that the shoulder muscles come
into play most strongly when the electrodes are applied near the superior limit of
the area, the muscles moving the forearm and wrist when they are applied near the
central and inferior portions of the area, and the muscles of the wrist and fingers when
applied along the posterior border. Here it is sometimes possible also to differentiate
between the different movements of the fingers and wrist, for superiorly the exci-
tation usually produces pronation of the hand with extension of the fingers and
wrist, and inferiorly supination of the hand with flexion of the fingers. The produc-
tion of these movements of the fingers is not confined to excitation of the ascending
parietal gyrus,* but in very many cases the same movements are produced by exciting
the ascending frontal at the corresponding point just across the fissure of RoLanpo.

The supination which frequently accompanies flexion of the fingers on excitation of
