this species during four to five years is, as T1son says, due to the obliquely vertical
course of the trace as it passes through the wood, a circumstance which means that
the increasing diameter of the stem exerts a pressure which is lateral rather than
vertical.

ON THE ARAUCARIEA, RECENT AND EXTINCT. 353

Tn Araucaria imbricata and A. brasiliensis the traces are also oblique in their course,
but less so than in Agathis obtusa, T1son speaks of Araucaria as exhibiting an
unusual persistence of the leaf-trace elements, a fact previously noticed by
Marxkretpt. The French-author mentions a stem of Araucaria brasiliensis with 25
annual rings in which the leaf-traces were intact. Sir Wim11Am THIseLron-DyEr*
has described persistent traces in a stem of A. imbricata with 60 rings of growth,
and it would seem highly probable that in Araucaria the traces may prolong their
existence indefinitely.

We have examined the leaf-traces Araucaria imbricata, A. brasiliensis, A. excelsa

and Agathis robusta. The tracheids formed during the first year contain not only
spiral and annular elements as stated by Markretpr, but also tracheids with
bordered pits.t Plate 24, fig. 21, a, represents a leaf-trace of A. imbricata as seen in
a radial longitudinal section of a branch two to three years old. A strand of thick-
