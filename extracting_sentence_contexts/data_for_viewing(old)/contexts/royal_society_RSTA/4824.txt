A more picturesque approach was brought forward by a participant in a blog discussion:
imagine that both Alice and Bob carry with them a cage, and in it a mouse, and some grain to
feed it. Just before making her decision about the angle a, Alice counts the number of droppings
produced by the mouse in her cage. If it is even, she chooses the angle a to be 0, and if it is
odd, a= 45°. Bob does the same by inspecting his cage. Now, the function (7.2) tells us that the
polarization angles of the two emitted photons have to be correlated with the way the bowels of
these mice work, long before they produced their droppings! Would that not be a disgusting theory?

Let us first note that strong correlations are ubiquitous in our models [20]. For example,
in our ‘neutrino’ model, §3, the dynamical variables take the form of flat sheets, which show
strong space-like correlations even though their dynamical equations of motion are local, as was
explained at the end of that section. And then, given the fact that we have these correlations, what
exactly is the mathematical definition of disgusting?

More to the point, the correlation function (7.2) is still not quite in line with our theory
of the Cellular Automaton Interpretation (CAI) of quantum mechanics. The correlation has to be
complete! According to the principles of our ontological interpretation of quantum mechanics [6],
the universe is always in a state where all beables 6;(t) at all times t, take precisely defined values.
Therefore, the photons emitted by the source « must have well-defined polarizations in exactly
the same basis that is later employed by Alice and Bob, already when they are emitted, at time
t=fp in figure 1. This feature is an evident fact of all explicit models that we can produce, and
is the central assumption of the CAI, but now it is also clear that it is exactly here that we have
