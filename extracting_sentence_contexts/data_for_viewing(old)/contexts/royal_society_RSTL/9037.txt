(2) A thermoelectric current does not usually attain its maximum strength imme-
diately, nor does it cease altogether immediately after the withdrawal of the source of
heat. In these experiments we have invariably found that, on interposing a screen in
the path of the beam of light, the current immediately ceased, and on withdrawing the
screen, the current was at once renewed in its original strength. The phenomena
noticed are exactly similar to those observed when a tangent-galvanometer and a
galyanic cell are joined up by a key in simple circuit. On closing the circuit, the
needle 8wings at once up to, and then oscillates about its ultimate position of rest, and
stays there while the current is passing. On breaking the circuit, the needle at once
returns, oscillates on either side of, and then stops at zero.

During these experiments we were frequently struck by the analogy of the two cases,
and impressed with the idea that cutting off the light was, in point of fact, removing
the electromotor of the current.

In these investigations we have seen :â€”

(1) That a slight increase of temperature of a piece of annealed selenium is accom-
panied by a large increase of electrical resistance,

(2) That on increasing the strength of the current through the selenium, there was a
diminution in its resistance, which seems to be due to a kind of polarization which is
