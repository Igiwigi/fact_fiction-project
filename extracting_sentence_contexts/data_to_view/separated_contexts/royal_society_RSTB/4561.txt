They usually take the form of what is apparently the late arrival of
a second zoospore after the first has begun to penetrate the epidermis. Provided
penetration has not advanced too far, fusion is effected, and the zygote nucleus is
formed. The fact that two zoospores have already fused does not act as a deterrent
to a third, and cases have been found in which a zoospore is firmly perched on the
top of an entering zygote. No real membrane is formed round the zygote, but a slight condensation of
protoplasm takes place at the surface, and, should plasmolysis occur, this outer layer
remains in position, while the protoplasm within contracts (fig. 107). Fig. 102 shows an aggregation of zygotes in a depression on the surface of a
tumour.
