181. Internal Structure.—By the fortunate contingency already adverted to, I have
been enabled to study the internal structure of this remarkable type, not merely by
examining thin sections of the shell taken in various directions, and by comparing the
appearances they present with those obtained by laying open its interior by fracture ;
but also by swbmitting to microscopic examination siliceous © casts ”* of its cavities and
channels, which appear to represent with the utmost fidelity the forms and connexions
of the various parts of the sarcode-body which occupied those cavities and channels in
the living state of this organism. Between the results of these two modes of study I
have found the conformity to be 80 exact, that the account of the structure of the
animal which I should have given from examination of the shell alone, has not needed
to be modified in the slightest particular by the information more recently furnished by
these © casts ; ” and, in point of fact, the ideal representation in Plate XVIII. fig. 1, which
was entirely based on the former source of information, has not needed the least altera-
tion to bring it into accordance with the exact delineations of the latter class of objects
which are given in figs.
