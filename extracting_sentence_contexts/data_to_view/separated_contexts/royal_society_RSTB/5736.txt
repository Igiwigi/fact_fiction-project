It will be noted that the idea of segregation contains two parts: first, that the
process gives rise to parts with new potentialities, as Hoapiry concluded, and secondly;
that it involves a restriction of potentiality from a general to a particular. Liniie

(1929), who has discussed the concept from a general standpoint, defines it as the “ process
of origin of parts of the embryo possessing irreversible prospective value as tested by
self-differentiation,”’ and characterises it as being a process of segregation. The
difficulty here arises that self-differentiation techniques do not in fact test irreversible
prospective value. In Triton the ectoderm can be shown to possess the capacity to
self-differentiation to epidermis, and probably to neural plate, at a stage before it is
restricted to this fate. True irreversible prospective value can only be tested by
interchange experiments.
