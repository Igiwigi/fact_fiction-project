from Fiji and Tonga, have been separated as a distinct variety, named
“laciniata” (Brapy). So far as I have seen they are all microspheric. I may further recall the fact that the peripheral annuli of the full grown disc of this
form are often found to be not divided up into small cubical or columnar chambers,
as are those lying nearer the centre, but are composed of spacious chambers extending
vertically through the whole thickness of the disc, and circumferentially round a
considerable portion of its circuit. These may be called the brood chambers (fig. 43). In specimens which Brapy obtained from the reefs of Fiji these chambers contained
multitudes of young shells, consisting of the “ primitive discs” of the megalospherie
form.
