Consider the right-hand
sides div R, in the equation (3.16) produced by the iteration scheme described in the previous
paragraph. How far is such div R, from vg Av,? Recall that the solutions produced by the scheme
are in fact smooth, and so if we were able to produce them so that div Rq = vgAvg, we would in
fact get a sequence of smooth solutions of Navier-Stokes. At the qualitative level, there are some remarkable similarities between the terms div R,
generated by the proof of theorem 3.5 and what the K41 theory predicts for the viscous dissipation
vgAuq. A first elementary observation is that vg Avg = div vq(Dug + Duj) and that vg(Dug + Dvj)
is a traceless symmetric tensor.
