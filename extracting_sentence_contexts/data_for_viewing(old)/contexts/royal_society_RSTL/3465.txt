432. The principal observations hitherto published on the contents of the unfecun-
dated germinal vesicle throughout the animal kingdom, were made by Professor
Rupouyx WacxgRF, to whom we are indebted for the discoyery of the germinal spot.
1 am truly glad that it has fallen to my lot, as I venture to believe, to show the im-
portance of this discovery, which has been questioned.

433. In the ovum of some animals the spot is single,—in that of others there
are many spots ; this being the apparent difference above referred to (par. 431.).
R. WaeneR observed that the ova of certain animals in which originally there is only
one $pot, at a later period present a number ; and he conjectured that this might be
referable to a division of the primary spot into several parts}. It will be seen from
what takes place in the mammiferous oyum, that this conjecture was very near the
truth ; and facts about to be made known, will serve to explain another observation
of the same physiologist, namely, that the number of spots in some instances increase
as the ovum ripens.

434. © In Birds,” says Wacxen, © the germinal vesicle has always a germ-nucleus
[germinal spot], which often forms a tolerably compact mass of finer molecules, but
frequently consists of a very transparent and delicate tissue, and may thus be easily
overlooked.” In scaled Amphibia the germinal spot is © at first single, but dissolves
into several scattered points or globules, which adhere to the inner surface of the
germinal vesicle||.” In naked Amphibia, © instead of a single germ-nueleus or spot,
there are always—even in the very youngest ova—several shining globules having a
high refracting power. In maturer ova these become more numerous, but they are
relatively and absolutely smaller, and often pressed together, being everywhere
