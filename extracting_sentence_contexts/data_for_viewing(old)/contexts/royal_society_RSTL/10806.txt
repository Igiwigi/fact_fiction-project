and approximately perpendicular to the axis in air. I firsb fixed ib in its place
with soft, wax, adjusting it with my eye ab the telescope, and then gecured it
firmly by pouring in electrical cement behind it, AÅ¿ter this was attached, it;
was only necessary to bring its normal into the plane of measurement to secure
that the diametral chord was being measured. Plane B then may be defined as
paxsing through this normal and being approximately perpendicular to plane A.

The firs6 ring was considerably broader and less sharply defined than the
others; yeb in obtaining the diameters recorded in the tables below I have relied
on a single reading of each side even of the first ring. For during a long course
of preliminary measurements I had found, that two readings of the first ring
would seldom differ more than }', thongh I could not be confident that the true
reading lay within 4' of either. Ib seemed in fact to be easier to bring the
needle back to the same point in the band than to make snre of that point being
the middle of the band. To obtain real accuracy I relied on varying the conditions
as much as possible. Thus the four sets of measurements recorded in Table I.
were made on four different days with different positions of the polariser, analyser, and
plate of quartz.

IT also made a number of measurements of the larger rings in Plate 1, but these,
I regret to say, have proved to be useless. The formule, which are compact enough
when the plate is ent truly perpendicular to the axis, become hopelessly complicated
when the deviation of the axis has to be introduced. Since the deviation of the
axis was 8mall I tried approximations, carrying them as far as the squares of
the deviations in the two directions. But the diserepancy between the results
