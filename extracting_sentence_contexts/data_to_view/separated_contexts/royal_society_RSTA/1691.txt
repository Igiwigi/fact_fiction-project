The purpose of the present work is twofold: firstly, in §2, we give a simple exposition of the
feedback theory of regular linear systems. To this end, we mainly use operator theory to facilitate
the task to the semigroup community. In fact, the interaction between semigroups and the theory
of feedback of regular systems [20] theories lies in perturbation theory [26, Chap. III]. For example,
the case of Miyadera—Voigt perturbation can be seen as the feedback of a system (A, Ix, C), where
C is an admissible observation operator for A, while the Desch-Schappacher perturbation as a
result of the feedback of a system (A,B,C), where C is a bounded operator from X to U and
B:U-— X_, is an admissible control operator for A.
