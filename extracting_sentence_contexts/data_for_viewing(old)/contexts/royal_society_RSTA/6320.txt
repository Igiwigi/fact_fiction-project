Figure 8. Spatial patterns of biases in reconstructed surface pCO, (average 2009-2018) as calculated from the two pCO,
products minus the original FESOM-REcoM p(0,, for MPI-SOM-FFN (left) and CarboScope (right) in the sampling schemes SOCAT
(top) and bgcArgo (bottom).

varying between —4 and +1 atm in MPI-SOM-FEN and between —4 and —1 patm in CarboScope
(figure 7).

The maps of the mean pCO, bias (figure 8) illustrate that the pCO, biases are only partly
co-located with the CO flux biases (figure 6). In fact, CarboScope pCO, biases (outside of the
Arctic) stem mostly from the Weddell and Ross Seas and a small region in the northwest Pacific.
These Southern Ocean regions are usually ice-covered and it is unlikely that pCO, biases in these
regions lead to substantial biases in CO2 flux. In MPI-SOM-FEN, the negative pCO, biases are
more equally distributed in the Southern Ocean, but are also not co-located with the CO) flux
biases (figures 6 and 8).

In summary, we conclude from the analysis of CO2 flux and pCO, biases that more and
regularly spaced observations can cure or substantially reduce biases in the temporal evolution
of the observation-derived CO flux estimates. However, even with regular 6° x 6° sampling
schemes, a discrepancy in the mean CO) flux between FESOM-REcoM and MPI-SOM-FFN
persists in the Southern Ocean, which suggests a methodological origin (figure 4). The pCO,
comparison (figures 7 and 8) suggests that the generally larger CO? flux in the pCO, products
