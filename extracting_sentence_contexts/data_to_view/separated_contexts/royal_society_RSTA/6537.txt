Preface

Published online 5 May 2004

There is currently a great effort amongst biologists, geneticists and mathemati-
cians to understand the mechanical properties and spatial deformations of the DNA
molecule. These deformations do in fact play an absolutely crucial role in allow-
ing DNA to perform its functions of replication and transcription. This effort has
generated a lot of deep collaborations between biologists on the one hand and math-
ematicians on the other. Writers from each camp here describe their latest research,
making a great effort to make it understandable to their counterparts in the other
area.
