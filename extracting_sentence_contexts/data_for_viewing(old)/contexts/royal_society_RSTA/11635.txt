The rigorous treatment of the problem of ocean currents, as affected by variations
in the density of the water, appears to be hopelessly beyond the powers of mathe-
matical analysis, and I will therefore leave the subject with the brief indications
already given in this section, and will conclude the paper with an example illus-
trating another means by which possibly ocean currents are in part maintained, and
which is instructive in showing the very important part played by the rotation of
the earth in rendering effective a cause which otherwise could give rise to no
sensible currents.

§ 15. On Currents due to Evaporation and Precipitation.

A cause which has been advocated* in explanation of ocean currents is the
fact that in equatorial regions the amount of water evaporated into the atmosphere
largely exceeds that precipitated in the form of rain in these regions. The excess of
water in the atmosphere is carried away to be precipitated in temperate and polar
regions, thereby giving rise to an excess of precipitation over evaporation in the
latter regions. It has been urged with some reason that, as the actual amount
of water in equatorial regions does not diminish nor that in polar regions increase
from year to year, there must be a continual flow of water from the poles towards
the equator. The fact that this flow of water is in the opposite direction to
that observed at the surface, which for the most part sets from the equator towards
the poles, is explained by attributing the counterflow to undercurrents. If however
we subject the question to the test of mathematical analysis, we shall find that
though such a flow towards the equator must necessarily exist, it is so slow as to be
completely masked by larger currents due to other causes. ‘The flow in question
