The total hydrogen extracted exceeds that required for charging by 0° 26 eu
centim.
This is due to the fact that a slight leakage into the pump occurred at the pressu
264°5, so that the quantity pumped off at this pressure (0°59) is certainly too high,
The platinum black exhausted at the ordinary temperature gave off 13°14 cub. cen
= 35°13 volumes of hydrogen when heated to dull redness. We are, therefi
in a position to draw up the two following tables, which show the effect of diminish
pressure on the absorption of hydrogen by platinum black. In the first series
experiments the mean of the hydrogen absorbed and hydrogen exhausted is used.
