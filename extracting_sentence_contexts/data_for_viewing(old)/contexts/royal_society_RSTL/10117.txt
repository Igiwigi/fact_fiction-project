Htal residue. The amount of potassium in the quantity of powder exploded is known
Som the analysis of the powder, and as the whole of this potassinm must reappear in
Me 8olid residue, it is easy to find the total residue if the weight of potassium in a

Sie explosion.
2 This mode of calculation requires that the exact composition of the powder used in
@ch experiment should be known. Messrs. NoBLE and ABEL assume the composition
If the powders of Waltham Abbey, P., R. F. G., and F. G., to be constant; they also
Snsider in their firs memoir that of R. L. G. to be 80, but in their second memoir
ey base the calculations of the later experiments on the second analysis of this
ription of powder. This ass8umption is, as a matter of fact, nob correct ; on the
TSontrary, we may take it as highly probable, that in any two experiments made by
YoBLE and ABEL with the same class of powder, the powder used in the one experi-
ent was not exactly of the 8ame composition as the powder used in the other.
ccordingly the weight of the solid residue as calculated by NopLe and ABEL will
ave been found in some experiments too high, in others too low, and as a consequence
of this the total weight of the gaseons products cannob have been exact. The correct-
ness of this is proved by the differences between the composition of the powders
calculated from the products of combustion, and the compoxsition deduced from direct
analysis (86 pp. 530, 531). These errors will, however, compensate each other if we
take the mean of the analytical results of all the experiments.
Before. we proceed to do 80 it will be desirable to consider another cireumstance
which is not without influence on the final results of Messrs. NoBLE and ABEL.
