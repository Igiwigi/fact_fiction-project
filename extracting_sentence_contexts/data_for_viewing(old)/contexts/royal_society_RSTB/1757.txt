In Heterangium, the former distinctly belong to the cortex, while in Lyginodendron
they are usually limited to the pericycle. The vascular bundles in Heterangium
leave the pericycle early in their outward course and pass gradually outwards through
the cortex, while in Lyginodendron they keep within the pericycle until they
approach their exit from the stem.

2. Course of the Vascular Bundles.

The main facts as to the course of the vascular bundles in Heterangium Grievit
have always been understood, since the first description of the plant was published in
1872. A series of eight transverse sections from a piece of stem nearly two inches
long, figured in Part IV., Plate 30, affords conclusive proof that the vascular bundles,
which are found in the cortex, pass gradually outwards and enter the bases of the
leaves, each of which receives a single bundle. At the same time the lower ends of
these bundles were traced downwards to their point of union with the central
cylinder.*

It has only been necessary for us to consider two points :â€”

1. What light does the course of the bundles throw on the phyllotaxis of the
a.plant ?
