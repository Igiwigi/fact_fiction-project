The vertical furrow connecting the sulcus postcentralis superior with sulci of the
supramarginal gyrus lying posterior to the posterior end of the fissure of Sylvius, as
seen in ยง.13.R., occurs in nine other hemispheres, eight of which are on the right side
(C.2.R., S.1.R., Q.2788.R., Q.1905.R., Q.1487.R., S.6.R., Q.2640.L., $.5.R., and
S.8.R.). In the majority of these cases the width of the inferior postcentral gyrus is
reduced. In S.1.R. the cortex of the temporal lobe has been destroyed, but sufficient remains
to establish the fact that the inferior parallel sulcus is closely connected with the long
vertical sulcus passing up to the sulcus postcentralis superior. Posterior to this,
the pattern of the sulci of the inferior parietal lobule is H-shaped. The sulcus occi-
pitalis anterior forms a complete arcade parallel with the sulcus lunatus.
