By examining natural symmetry structures that arise from the algebraic
analysis of discrete models of biological and related biochemical systems, we aim to begin to
answer these questions. Our main goals are thus twofold: (i) to identify and understand mathematically the natural
subsystems and hierarchical relations inside discrete models of natural systems and (ii) to use
insights we find there to define a new model of computation driven by interactions that is useful
for both biology and computation. Despite the fact that symmetry structures in biological systems
continually degenerate (but are also renewed and replaced), we demonstrate here that nature
may be using symmetry computationally in hidden ways. This leads us to consider dynamic
ensembles (such as cell assemblies) whose constituents and interconnections change based on
interaction and whose constituents have a rich structure of natural subsystems internally. The remainder of ยง1 reviews necessary background on algebraic theory of automata, automata
networks and algebraic structures associated with them, while motivating the ensemble viewpoint
on multiple interacting systems that is developed further throughout the article.
