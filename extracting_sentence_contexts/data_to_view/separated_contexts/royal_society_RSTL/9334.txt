It may here be stated that these peculiar
bodies are found in very scant numbers throughout the various 8ubjacent layers, but
towards the lower realms of the spindle layer they again congregate in larger numbers,
become especially abundant along the blood-vessels which course through the medullary
strands at the confines of the cortex. It is evident from this distribution that they
are more especially limited to the regions of the greater vascular channels, and do not
intrude upon the regions of capillary distribubion. This fact I regard as significant,
when we also take into consideration their reappearance in Man as morbid elements
in those diseases of the brain which are regarded as closely connected by a causal
relationship with extensive vascular legions. > The pia mater is nob only thickened, but
is strongly attached to the cortex by means of these bodies, and over certain regions,
as the two lower parietal convolutions, the adhesion is 80 strong that the pia cannot
be separated without destroying the subjacent layer. In these regions of firm
adhesions betwixt the pia mater and cortex the processes of these cells are extremely
coarse, and often form a dense felt of fibres immediately beneath the pia. Such a
condition I have not observed in Man except as the result of retrogressive changes in
diseased regions.
