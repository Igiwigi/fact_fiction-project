Equally important are vegetationâ€”climate dynamics, which for
example determined the end of the African Humid Period. In the middle of our
current interglacial (warm period) ca 5.5 kyr ago, the Sahara suddenly dried out
and became the extensive desert we have today. The fact that vegetation changes
can happen at the time scale of decades is illustrated by modern data from Lake
Chad. In 1963, it was the sixth largest lake in the world; by 2001 reduced rainfall
had shrunk it to the tenth largest in the world. Ice sheets are also not as stable as once was thought which is significant for the
future of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets.
