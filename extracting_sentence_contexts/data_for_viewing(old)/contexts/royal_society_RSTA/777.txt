flight spectrometer consisting of a dispersive fibre and an avalanche photodiode [32]. In the first
case, there is essentially only one spectral mode, while in the second case, there is a distribution
of spectral modes with decreasing Schmidt coefficients. The Schmidt decomposition of the anti-
correlated JSI shows modes which resemble Hermite-Gaussian modes. Those modes could now
be addressed individually by the QPG. This way we could operate on individual squeezers or
perform operation on several to produce a large entangled state.

The important question is how much squeezing could we generate using such a source? From
the photon number of the states versus pump power, shown in figure 5 as well as the full photon-
number distribution presented in [18], we believe that the spectral properties do not change at
least up to mean photon numbers of 20, corresponding to 19 dB of squeezing. The time-ordering
effect should show a deviation from the curve in figure 5, which does not happen. This might be
explained by the fact that we use a broad spectral filter with a width very close to the generated
spectrum: since time-ordering predicts a spectral broadening of the down-conversion modes, a
spectral filter might suppress this effect. Nevertheless, even below this regime of up to 20 photons
we expect very strong squeezing producible from the waveguide. In the implementation of [18],
the squeezing would be limited by the total losses of around 35%, as other limiting factors such
as noise can already be excluded from the clean photon-number distribution. These losses so far
are mainly due to optics and couplings outside of the waveguide. In an integrated solution or an
extremely loss-optimized set-up, the squeezing would ultimately be limited by the loss inside the
waveguide. For KTP, even low loss waveguides still have losses above 0.2 dB cm7!. One might
expect that this sets a bound on the achievable squeezing similar to cavity-based systems where
