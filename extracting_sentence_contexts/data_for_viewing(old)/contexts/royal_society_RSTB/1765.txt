extreme from Selaginella, where the sporangia are axillary. There is a certain
analogy with the insertion of the synangium in Psilotaceze, especially 7’mesipteris,
but this comparison is of doubtful value, so long as the homologies of the Psilotaceous
synangium remain uncertain.t If Professor Bower is right in believing that the
synangium represents a single, elaborated sporangium, then the comparison with
Spencerites may hold good. But if, as GorBrn} supposed, the synangium corresponds
to a fertile branch, or if, as I have ventured to suggest in a previous paper,§ it
represents the sporangiferous pedicel in Sphenophyllew, then the structure is no
longer comparable with that of our fossil. However this may be, the Psilotacez
appear to be too remote from the strobiloid Lycopods to throw much light on a
fructification like that of Spencerites.

In the fact that the insertion of the sporangium is broader in the tangential than
in the radial direction, the new genus differs conspicuously from Lepidostrobus, and
resembles some living species of Lycopodium, such as L. clavatum and L. Selago.||

The distal insertion of the sporangium—reminding us of Cheirostrobus and the
Sphenophylleze, otherwise so remote—may perhaps be an indication that Spencerites
