As our feasible region of the
QP is compact, we can apply quadratic programming theory (see [31]). It follows that there exists
a polynomial time algorithm for (3.11) that provides e-exact solutions. As â€”A has exactly one
negative eigenvalue, this polynomial time is in fact quadratic. However, to our knowledge, there
is no algorithm for QPs with EDMs available so far where this property has been proven. Still, it
is fair to assume that any reasonable algorithm available for solving (3.11) will benefit from the
aforementioned structure of the problem.
