Notes.—(1) The angles in column 2 are the difference between the normal divergence angle (taken as
136°-5) and the angles P,-wound, to which 3°-5 has first been added to allow for the fact that these angles,
as measured, were about 3°-5 too small (see footnote to section 5).

(2) Columns 5 and 6 are calculated from columns 2, 3 and 4, the are of the presumptive area of I, being
taken as 124°.


374 M. SNOW AND R. SNOW: EXPERIMENTS ON PHYLLOTAXIS.

experiment not yet mentioned, No. 26, in which bracts arose on both sides of the wound.
It can be seen from the table that the imperfect leaves all covered arcs that were larger
than those of the bracts, though less large than those of normal leaves. For their arcs
ranged from 88° to 115°, whereas those of the bracts ranged from 60° to 82°. It can also
