The adductor muscle is thus
almost completely encircled at the margin of its attachment to the scuta by large blood
vessels in the form of a reversed C. At the level of the top of the attrahens muscle there is a watch-pocket valve, allowing
the blood to pass from the scutal vessel into the lateral but not vice versa. There is a valve,
in fact, which controls the passage of blood back from the capitulum, and hence peduncle,
into the body. This in itself would not necessitate a different name for the two parts of the
apparently single vessel above and below the valve. But in the preliminary study of
Conchoderma auritum I have found that the lateral vessel consists of the sheath of the attrahens
muscle, or, to put it another way, the lateral vessel contains the attrahens muscle.
