Palmula sagittaria Lea, he has studied.

Lea referred to two specimens on which he proposed to found the genus, but figured
only one, Howe’s figure 2. This shows a form which would certainly be referred to
Frondicularia, since nothing more than a slight asymmetry of the first two chambers is
shown, the protoconch being represented as a large, more or less ovoid, chamber. Of
this specimen Howe states ‘its thickness is slightly greater near the initial end than in the
fan-shaped later portion, and it is evidently coiled, but the shell material was too cloudy
to make out the exact chamber arrangement. I made camera lucida drawings of the
chamber arrangement of both specimens which are given as figures 1, 2.’ The only
evidence, therefore, that the figured type specimen has a coiled initial portion is Howe’s
statement quoted above (my italics), since his figure shows none. If, however, he be
correct in his statement, then the specimen, depicted as megalospheric, must in fact be
microspheric. The second, larger, specimen referred to by Lea is figured by Howe as
microspheric, with a small initial coil, though again it seems not clear enough to
figure without some broken lines.

The genus Frondicularia is described by Cushman (1933, p. 182) as ‘. . .in the early
stage in the microspheric form, sometimes partially coiled, megalospheric form not
coiled. ...’ As the generic position of Lea’s Palmula sagittaria is not yet wholly free
from elements of doubt, it seems at present preferable to continue the use of the well
established name Flabellina.
