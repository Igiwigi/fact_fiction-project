amended later, shows 553, for m = 4, 6, 7, and 384, for m = 5, the lines for m<3
being outside region of observation. The evidence points to a normal rule that the
differences for the orders beyond the first in any spectrum are the same, but different
from—in general greater than—that of the first.

The Order Differences——The order differences change very considerably with a
change in the value taken for the limit, 7.¢., in the value given to & No doubt with
unlimited choice of ¢ it would be possible to arrange a set of denominator differences
all multiples of the oun within error limits, for a series of values of ¢ could be found
making the first difference a multiple. Out of these one or two would probably give
the second such a multiple. After the second the error limits as a rule come to be
E very large, in fact larger than half the oun itself, except in case of very high atomic
weight. No conclusions could be drawn from any such arrangement. But in the
26 present cases the choice of ¢ is bounded by very narrow limits, for the relation
D(#)=S() is supposed to hold, and, as a rule, the values of S(c) are known

6 with very considerable accuracy, and the possible limits of variation are known.

They were given in [I.] and [IL]. Before proceeding to draw general conclusions
from Table IL., it will be well to consider in more detail the data for the different
z elements on which the table is based.
