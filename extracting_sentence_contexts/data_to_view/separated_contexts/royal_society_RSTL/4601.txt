The ease with which the animal
becomes separated from this organ is no objection to this view; the necessity there
seems to exist for the reproduction of the latter rather confirming my opinion.” It is highly desirable that more information should be gained about this extraordi-
nary respiratory organ, which, if it exist, will not only be quite $47 generis in its class,
but in all animated nature. And in a physiological point of view, the development
of a vascular network, many times larger than the animal from which it proceeds, in
the course of balf an hour, will be a fact equally unique and startling.

86. As to the zoological relations of Appendicularia, its discoverer, as we have een,
considers that © it may possibly be allied to Cestum,” a conjecture in which no one
can possibly coincide. MR. HUXLEY ON DOLIOLUM AND APPENDICULARIA.
