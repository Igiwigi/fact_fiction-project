All of these equations reflect conservation laws. With the notable exception of elastic solids (which
we shall elaborate on below), all equations are strictly mathematically equivalent and have the
form of a generalized Laplace equation

V-(aVf)=0 (1.2)

for a scalar function f(r). Upon performing a coordinate transformation according to r—> r! =
r'(r), one can arrange the problem into a Laplace equation of the same form; however, the scalar


Figure 1. The concept underlying coordinate-transformation-based cloaking can intuitively be explained by a square grid
of streets in a city. Distorting the original city in (a) on a computer by software, e.g. PHorosHop, leads to an apparently
inhomogeneous and anisotropic distribution of car velocities in (6). The trick of transformation optics is to turn this fictitious
velocity distribution into a real one by introducing a corresponding material distribution. Adapted from [3]. (Online version
