work is done in loosening the chemical bonds—work which Berruetor ealls “ le
travail de désagrégation moléculaire qui précéde la décomposition.” Of the fact ot
the partial dissociation of carbonic acid and steam at the temperature of the detona-
tion-wave, Mr. H. W. Smirn and I have found. direct proof in the unburnt gases
left on cooling. t

Liverne and Dewar} showed in 1884 that the flame of an explosion of gases in a

_ glass vessel exhibited with marked brightness the lines of sodium and of calcium.

When the explosion ot electrolytic gas was made to pass along an iron tube about
3 feet long, closed at one end by a plate of quartz, a spectroscope placed in a line
with the axis of the tube revealed the fact that the light was largely due to iron
lines. When metallic salts in the form of powder were introduced into the explosion
tube, the corresponding lines were visible in the spectroscope. These experiments
showed how quickly the ignited gases could detach and volatilise solid matter from
the side of the tube. But as regards the nature of the detonation-wave itself, the
most interesting observation made by Livninc and Dewar was the reversal of the
red lithium line when the explosion was made to travel towards the spectroscope.
The natural interpretation of this reversal was that “there are gradations of tem-
perature in the flame, and that the front of the advancing wave of explosion is
somewhat cooler than the following part.” I would observe on this conclusion that
in the many hundreds of photographs taken by me, the front of the detonation-wave
is always shown as exceedingly sharp, and that probably the reversal observed was
due to the wave reflected back from the quartz plate.
