This work, while promising, :
raises some key questions, notably regarding the robustness of the finding and the extent to fA
which it generalizes to other kinds of stimuli. In this paper, we briefly review the White et al. Dw
[8,9] research, including the QP principles that underlie the model, before describing the novel :
empirical directions that are the present focus. :3

(a) The constructive effects of affective evaluation

In White et al.â€™s [8,9] experiments, fictitious adverts for insurance and mobile phones were created
that had positive or negative content. Either the valence of images was confirmed in a pilot study
or images were selected from the Geneva Affective Picture Database (GAPED) [10], a database
that contains images whose valence has been externally validated. In a within-subjects design,
participants were asked to view two images, which were displayed sequentially in either a
positive and then negative order (PN condition) or vice versa (NP condition; figure 1).
