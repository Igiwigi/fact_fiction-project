We have repeatedly referred to the absence, in the early stages of Monotreme
development, of any such ectodermal “shield” differentiation, in front of the
primitive knot, as is to be found in reptiles, On the other hand, we have seen

* In this connection it has also been pointed out that in the neurular Specimen H the structure of the
blastoporic region and intact portion of the archenteron are practically identical with those of the post-
gastrular stage. Yet in Specimen H there has meanwhile occurred an extensive differentiation of definitive
notochord throughout no less than 17 millims., associated with a reduction in length of the primitive
streak behind the knot to about 1°5 millims. This fact strengthens the necessity for the assumption of a
further backward migration of the posterior end of the archenteron, this time at the direct expense of the
primitive streak. And, if this be so, the presumption will be strengthened, that the greater part of the
elongation of the archenteron which has taken place since the period when the primitive knot was situated
well in front of the primitive-streak area, may have been effected by the operation of a like process. OBSERVATIONS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ORNITHORHYNCHUS. 107

that an area of apparently analogous character does arise, at an early period,
altogether behind the primitive knot ; and that this is traversed by the autogenous
primitive streak.
