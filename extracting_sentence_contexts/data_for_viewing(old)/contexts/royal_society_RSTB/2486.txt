(1.) Diminished loss of heat, by better insulation, or less evaporation from skin and
lungs.

(2.) A lower body-temperature.

(3.) Failure to maintain a constant body-temperature.

T have already ‘shown that none of the animals maintained a constant body-
temperature throughout ‘the experimental range. The Marsupials, however, kept
their temperature more constant than the rabbit, though less so than the cat.
Imperfect homeothermie adjustment cannot explain this relative economy on their
part. It is, I believe, largely due to their better insulation, though the fact that
their average body-temperature is 2° lower than that of Mammals will account for
it to a small extent. This explanation certainly does not explain the small heat
production of Echidna, which is covered with spines and coarse hairs which do not
afford a good insulation, One must accordingly look to their low temperatures
(under 30°) and defective homeothermism for an explanation. Fig. 6 is a graphic
representation of the relation of CO, production to the difference in temperature
