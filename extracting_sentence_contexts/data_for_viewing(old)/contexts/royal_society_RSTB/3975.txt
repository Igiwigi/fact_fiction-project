For my own blood Pounron (13) and I worked out a relationship between the CO,
pressure to which my blood was exposed and the value of K for me; this relation is
shown in fig. 9.

Taking my normal value for K as 00029, the value at over 10,000 feet would be
approximately ‘000267, the difference K being ‘000023. At this portion of the
eurve such a decrease in K would correspond to an increase of the order of 3 mm. in
the alveolar carbonic acid. This is a very rough measurement, for the curve in fig. 9
is only based on a few determinations of K, still it probably gives an indication of the
order of change in the hydrogen-ion concentration of the blood at high altitudes.
Such a change would of course tend to increased ventilation. It is not necessary to
go into the literature of this question, the increased ventilation is well known to exist
and is in fact the counterpart of the decrease in the alveolar CO,. ‘The actual
amount of CO, which leaves the body is not reduced. The whole question is discussed
in a paper by Campseti, Doveras, HALDANE and Hopson (‘ Journ, Physiol.,’ vol. 46,
p- 316), to which the reader is referred. These authors conclude that the difference
in reaction of the blood at Pike's Peak and at Oxford should correspond to the
addition of 0°8 mm. CO,. In this there are considerable individual differences, but
it is at least satisfactory to find that two methods so widely different should have
given. results of the same order. It seems clear that in the blood of the resting
individual there is a trifling increase in hydrogen-ion concentration at high altitudes,
but this is small as compared with the change that can be induced by exercise.

Though no actual measurements of hydrogen-ion concentration were made by us on
Monte Rosa, Perers undertook the task of investigating whether or no any relation
