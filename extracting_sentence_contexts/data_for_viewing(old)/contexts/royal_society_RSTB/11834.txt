us to position this European version of rewilding in relation
to the US 3C’s version.

Rewilding Europe has developed three facilities to support
these initiatives and the wider European Rewilding Network:
the European Safari Company (an online booking platform),
the EWB and REC. The latter two facilities are of particular
relevance to this special issue.

Scaling-up the restoration of natural grazing dynamics is
constrained by the limited supply of herds of wild horses and
bovids. The EWB is a response to these constraints and the
fact that many rewilding initiatives lack the funds to buy
animals. The EWB enters into 5-year custodianship contracts
with recipient landowners or area managers. On maturity of
the 5-year contract, half of the herd must be ‘paid back’ to
grow the EWB’s ‘wildlife capital.’ Usually, the size of a
herd triples during this contract period. Furthermore, the
contracts are structured to enable the EWB to maintain
control over the development and quality of ecologically
functional breeds of bovines and horses, without doing the
daily management.

Since 2011, the EWB herd has grown from less than 300 (a) A rewilding action philosophy
