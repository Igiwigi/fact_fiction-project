noted. To make the form of the fossil scales clear we must consider them in radial

section. In text-fig. 15, c and p, the pad of tissue previously mentioned is shown as
it appears in sections cut transversely across the scale, that is, ina tangential direction
as regards the whole cone. They are cut in that very narrow region where the flap
of tissue is developed, and as a result it appears to have a far greater importance in
relation to the whole scale than it has in actual fact. In a view of the surface of the
whole scale, the flap would be seen to be actually a very small structure which lies
only in the immediate region of the attachment of the
seeds. As Cunninghamia is not a very accessible genus,
and we know of no such figure in the literature, a radial
section of the scale showing the true relation of scale and
flap and the position of the vascular strands may be useful
(see text-fig. 17). This diagram represents also the
essentials in the fossil scale.

Sacus, and later Ercuier, have described the case in
