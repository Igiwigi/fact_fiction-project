field potential (at <1Hz) similar to those observed in vivo (figure 2c), and the
strong dependence of the slow oscillation frequency on membrane polarization
(see [2]) strongly argue for the slow oscillation in TC and NRT neurons as
being a pacemaker activity. In fact, it results from the membrane potential
bistability that is generated by the interplay of [Leak and the window component
of the low threshold Ca?+ current Fp (Itwindow) [36-39], such that the UP state
essentially corresponds to the condition when Ipyindow is active and the DOWN
state to when Ipwindow iS inactive [40,41]. Other membrane currents that are
essential for the expression of the slow oscillation in TC and NRT neurons include
Tcan (Ca?+-activated, non-selective cation current) and J, (hyperpolarization-
activated, Na*/Kt current) [2], which in the absence of synaptic inputs are the
