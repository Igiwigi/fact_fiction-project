at the time
when segmentation commenced, at the end of siz hours and thirty:five minutes. In
the most submerged it did not take place until sx hours and forty-five minutes had
elapsed. In nearly the whole of the eggs of this mass which had been fecundated by the
natural union of the sexes, I was struck with the fact that the quantity of sperma-
tozoa which had penetrated into every part of their envelopes was very considerable. Very many of these had arrived at, and were sticking by their larger end into the
vitellary membrane, from which they projected like spines from the head of a thistle ;
while there were many others which had not arrived at this part, their power of
penetration being exhausted, ana their progress inwards being arrested before they
had passed more than half-way through the outer gelatinous coverings. Others,
again, had penetrated to scarcely more than their own length into them, while a till
greater number were simply in contact with, and adhering to the external surface.
