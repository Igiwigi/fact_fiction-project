not more than 40 centims. diameter near its base, which dimensions are not far short
of the theoretical limits. All these facts afford strong indirect evidence towards the
necessity of the presence of active living elements in the conducting wood of tall
trees, but, of course, leaves it an open question as to whether these living elements
exercise a direct pumping action.

Section 20.—Critical Velocity for Stream-line Flow in Wood Vessels.

PorsEvILLe’s formula for the flow of liquid through tubes only applies when the
motion takes place in straight lines. If the speed is high the motion becomes
turbulent, and the resistance increases as a power of the speed, rising to 1'8 or 2.

* A point of some interest in this connection lies in the fact that the modulus of elasticity varies much
less than the breaking strain in different woods, and even in the wood of the poplar, the same is shown,
though to a less degree. Thus :—

Pine. Beech. Maple. Poplar. Birch. Oak.
E in kilogrammes per square millimetre . 1113 980 1021 517 917 921
Breaking strain in grammes . . . . . 4150 3570 2710 1480 4300 5660

The modulus of elasticity depends mainly upon the properties of the walls of the wood-fibres, which are
relatively constant, whereas the breaking strain depends largely upon the structure of the wood as a
whole, which varies to a much greater extent.
