spikes of fructification, which, being modified branches, might be expected to retain a.
branch-structure in their central axes. I have shown in my last memoir the existence
of exogenous layers in the axis of a Lepidostrobus, and I have in my cabinet specimens of
Volkmannia Binneyi which have a similar radiating external woody eylinder. - Hence
there is no impoxsibility inyolved in the supposition that similar conditions may have
prevailed in Dictyoxzylon. 'These, however, are purely hypothetical suggestions; and the
further fact remains, that we have hitherto discovered no fruits that could, with reason-
able probability, be correlated with the stems in question.
+ Whatever may haye been their functions, these branches throw a clear light upon the
origin of the irregular vascular medullary cylinder seen even in very young Dictyoxylons,
and which . only remain, in a fragmentary tate, as detached buttresses supporting the
inner 8urfaces of the exogenous woody zones. But we must further study this subject in
the light of the facts described in my last memoir on Lepidodendroid plants. I there
showed that the compact central vyascular axis of each young Lepidodendroid twig first
expanded into a vascular cylinder, through the rapid fusion and multiplication of some
of the more central cells located amongst the vessels, and which thus developed into a true
cellular medulla, the growth of which was synchronous with that of the vascular cylinder.
Efurther demonstrated that this compound axis became invested, at a till later period, by
