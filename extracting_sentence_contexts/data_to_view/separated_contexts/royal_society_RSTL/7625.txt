GrorGnt CLarkx of Mah6bourg, in Mauritius, we have had the advantage of
Sstudying at the same time a series of Dodos' bones (the fruits of his remarkable disco-
Sqery) more extensive even than that which furnished the subject of Professor OwEN's
Etreatise, and this by the Kkindness of the latter we have also had an opportunity of ex-
Zanining. Further, we haye been indebted to yarious other friends and naturalists for
"other specimens tending to illustrate the subject, to Professors REINHARDT and FRITSCH
Ffor casts of Didine remains existing in Copenhagen$ and Prague respectively, to Pro-
Sfesor ALpnoxsr Muxe-Epwarns for models of the Pezophaps-bones in Paris, and to Sir
SWiLLAN JarvixE for casts of those in Glasgow; while we have also to express our
Enoknowledgments to the authorities of the Royal College of Surgeons of England for
CI liberality im lending us the precious skeleton of Didunculus strigirostris | from

* We have certainly never made a close study of euch an extensive series of the bones of any ons other
species as we have done of the Solitaire, and therefore we are perhaps not in a poxition to form a true compa-
rison ; but it does 8eem to us that the amount of individual variation both here and in the Dodo is extraordinarily
great. The pozsible explanation of this fact, if it be a fact, will be discussed in our concluding observations.

$ The Copenhagen Dodo's head is often spoken of as © mutilated,” and by one writer as * lacking the lower
Jaw.” Its s0le imperfections are the absence of the left pterygoid, and the enlargement of the foramen mag-
