The partial heat- and work-exchanges are additive according to (4.1), whereas the entropy
exchanges are not additive because of the different contact temperatures of the subsystems and
the partition between them

Q'+0?+QP=Q and (4.58)
A proof of the inequality (4.58)2 can be found in [8] and more detailed in appendix B (B11). The
fact, that the entropy exchange of the undecomposed system is not equal to the sum of the entropy
exchanges of the compound system according to (4.58), is called the compound deficiency of the
entropy exchanges [8,9]. Compound deficiencies will be treated in more detail in §5f.

The power exchange was decomposed into its external and its internal part according to (4.46)
and (4.47). A similar decomposition is true for the heat- and entropy-exchange which is based on
the following statement: the sum of the internal heat exchanges vanishes and each partial internal
heat exchange vanishes with vanishing quantum mechanical interaction. We now consider the
sum of the first terms of (4.55)3 and (4.56)3
