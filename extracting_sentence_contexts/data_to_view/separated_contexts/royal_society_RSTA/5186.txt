which determines the ratio of 7, to 7, in the steady motion; and then the value of
gives the period of the rotation. For example when the electrons are equal and opposite e,; = — é, L,= = L,, and
7, = 1: thus the square of the velocity of either, ($w7r)?, is equal to V2/(2Lr — 4),
For the case of a spherical nucleus of radius a, L = 87/3; thus the velocity of eithe
must be considerably less than +V, which is small enough to allow this method te
approximately represent the facts for that case. It may be observed that in the general problem of the dynamics of a system of 3
electrons, the equations of conservation of momentum assume the forms
