ance of wrought-iron plates to a force calculated to.burst. them, follows; a, different
law to that of oak, the resistance of the former being directly as the depth and-of the
latter as the square of the depth. Reasoning from these facts, it may be! interesting to

ternal pressure increases in the ratio of the squares of its thickness ; and, where great,
strength is required, it will be necessary, in the construction of vessels, to consider
the nature of the service and the required thickness of the planks.
