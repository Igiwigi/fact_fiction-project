over those of E. miliaris. Whereas, however, in 1909-11 the larve in all cultures
showed the same inheritance, in 1912 the general rule just stated was occasionally
departed from, a few experiments yielding hybrids of a mixed type. The reason for this change in inheritance from one year to another, a change which
seems to be without exact parallel, we do not know, but a number of facts seem to
point to some altered condition of environment having influenced the germ cells of
E. miliaris during the period of growth and maturation. Artificial changes in inheritance have been described in Echinoderms by
Doncaster (21), Herpsr (39), and ‘lennent (90), and in Insects by TowzEr (93).

VeRNON (95) observed a seasonable change in the inheritance in Echinoid crosses
at Naples. Doncasrer (21) was able to bring this change about artificially by
