From Dr. Locks of Cincinnati I have received the result of a very extensive series
of observations of the Inclination and Force, on which he has been engaged for eight
years (1838 to 1845 inclusive), comprehending the determination of both elements at
about 100 stations, distributed in longitude from the seaboard of the United States
to the Mississippi River, and in latitude from 38* to 48%. It is in fact a magnetic
survey of the Inclination and Force over the north-western and north-eastern States
of the Union, conducted by an individual on his own unaided resources, and is one
of the many notable instances of private research elicited by the impulse and syste-
matic direction which have been given of late years to the study of terrestrial mag-
netism. The full account of these observations is designed to be published in the
Transactions of the American Philosophical Society ; but in the mean time the re-
sults have been spontaneously communicated to me by Dr. Locks (with whom I had
not previously the pleasure of being acquainted), with full permission to make sach
use of them as I might deem advantageous to science.
