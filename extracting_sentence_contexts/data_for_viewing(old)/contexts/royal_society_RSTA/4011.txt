can be detected in tear fluid by means of MS [91,98]. Protein content as well as the presence of .
therapeutic drugs in eye-derived specimens are also of great interest [43,99].

(e) Skin excretions

Human skin is coated with a film containing numerous compounds, which can altogether be
regarded as ‘skin excretions’. Some of these compounds are secreted by specialized glands
(predominantly, eccrine (sweat) and sebaceous (oil) glands), while others are produced during the
breakdown of proteins in the outermost layer of the skin [100]. Sweat fluid is mostly composed
of water. However, it also contains mineral elements (e.g. sodium and potassium) and organic
compounds such as proteins, amino acids, lactic acid and urea [101,102]. The typical sweating rate
(without stimulation) ranges from approximately 300 to 700 ml d™! [3]. Sebum is an oily substance
mostly composed of lipids. In fact, different compounds present on the skin surface have diverse
distributions (influenced by skin cells, microbes and daily routines) [103]. The main function of
sweating is to protect the human body from overheating. Skin excretions (including sweat) also
moisturize the skin, and protect it from evaporation of water.

It is difficult to collect pure sweat, separately from other skin excretions. Thus, usually a
mixture of all skin excretions, lifted from the skin, is analysed. However, in many reports, this
mixture is inaccurately referred to as ‘sweat’. One standardized method of pharmacological
stimulation of sweating is used to collect sufficient volumes of sweat-rich fluid (more than
50 wl) [35]. As we mentioned earlier, at first, sweating is induced by pilocarpine iontophoresis.
Then, the so-called Macroduct is employed to collect sweat. Smaller volumes of sweat and
skin excretions can be collected using various accessories, such as a semipermeable skin patch
(the most widely used), cotton swab, cellulose wipe, textile [104], silica plate [105] or hydrogel
