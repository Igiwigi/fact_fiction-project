Lastly, of the Medicago sativa soils, we have samples only in the sixth year of the
growth, which had rapidly increased to an enormous amount in the fifth year, 1884,
and yielded very large, though somewhat less, produce in 1885. Under these
circumstances the mean percentage of nitrogen in the surface soil is 0Â°1219, or higher
than in the case of any other plant or year, excepting in the 7 rifolium repens soil of
the same year. This is the case notwithstanding that more visible crop-residue had
been separated from the Medicago sativa soil samples than from any of the others ;
and in fact about three times as much as from the Zrifolium repens soils of the same
year. Indeed, it was estimated that the separated residue from the Medicago sativa
soil-samples, the nitrogen in which was determined, represented a removal of about

100 Ibs. of nitrogen per acre. Without relying on the exact figures as representing exact gains or losses of nitrogen
by the surface soils, we think it will be granted that the results are too consistent to
leave any doubt
