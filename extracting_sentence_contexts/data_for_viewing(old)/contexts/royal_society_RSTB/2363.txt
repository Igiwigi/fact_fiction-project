the two halves, anterior and posterior, of the eyeball, but at once was met with the
difficulty that the injury and compression incidental to the division of the eyeball into
two halves greatly modified the phenomenon. And whereas in the case of light the
contrast between effects of light upon the two halves was generally sufficiently well
marked by reason of there being no distinct effect at all on the anterior half, the
a similar contrast between the effects of electrical stimulation of the two halves was far
a less absolute ; I generally obtained a comparatively small effect upon the anterior
2 half of the eyeball, and, but by no means in every case, a comparatively large effect
2 upon the posterior half; but in at least two instances I find noted that the anterior
B % gave a larger effect than the posterior half. I therefore concluded that whereas in
S the seated response to light the retina is the principal, if not solely, effective
r factor, tissues of the eyeball other than retinal are coeffective in the electrical
a response to strong electrical stimulation ; and I recognised i in this fact an indication
ep that blaze currents might be expected to occur in other living tissues. The conse-
s
‘€ quent investigation* to which this gave rise will be reported on in due course; my
S present paper deals exclusively with the phenomena as witnessed upon the eyeball.
At a later period of the investigation I made careful comparison between
2 alterations of response to light and of response to electrical stimulation (vide infra).
3 The conclusion I arrived at from such comparisons may be expressed in the
a following apparently contradictory propositions to the effect that: (1) There is a
& degree of parallelism between response to light and response to electrical stimulation,
% indicating that the retina is concerned in both kinds of response; (2) There is a
= defect of parallelism between response to light and response to electrical stimulation,
