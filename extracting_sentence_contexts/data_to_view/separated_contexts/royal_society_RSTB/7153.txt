At 97-5Â°%, R.H. almost all
the larvae of X. cheopis and X. astia (tables 23, 24) were reared into adults in a period not
statistically longer than at 80% r.u. But at 100% R.H., even when the mixture was often
disturbed, its choking effect was felt prominently towards the end; consequently, a large
number of the males of X. cheopis and X. brasiliensis died, perhaps of suffocation. This is also
borne out by the fact that though the active larval life of these species was shorter, yet the
combined larval and pupal life of the males was longer at this humidity than at the other
favourable humidities. At 100% R.u. there was an appreciably better success in the
development of the larvae of X. astia than in the other two species, when kept under
identical conditions.
