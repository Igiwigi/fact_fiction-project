No. 2. p.m. 1! 45”, —Thirty-nine ova were treated in precisely the same way, except
that the interval between the application of impregnating fluid and the solution of
potass was only five seconds. The ova were removed, after the first day, to a room in which the average tempera-
ture was about 60* Fann., and at the end of the eighth day twenty-one embryos, ad-
vanced to near the end of the fourth period of development, had been produced in No. 1,
and to embryos, at a similar stage, in No. 2. This, at first thought, appeared to be an
extraordinary fact, seeing that the solution of potass 80 quickly decomposes the sper-
matozoa, and even renders the ovum sterile, as was afterwards found ; but, on exami-
nation of the details, the experiments admit of explanation :—first, the seminal fluid
was employed immediately it was obtained, and before the application of the potass,
which was not used, in the first case, until after a lapse of fifteen seconds, and in the
second case, of five seconds ; next, that in both instances the solution of potass was, as
quickly as possible after its application, diluted and removed by repeated washing of
the ova with water. Neyertheless, these experiments prove that the ovum becomes
impregnated very quickly after the application of spermatozoa, and, in these cases,
even within the short interval of Fifteen seconds in the one, and five seconds in the
other, the difference in the number of embryos produced in the two apparently in-
dicating the extent in each of the deleterious effect of the solution. THE OVUM IN THE AMPHIBIA.
