And it has been
generally supposed, that their agencies are, in some measure,
connected with the different powers of the metals to conduct
electricity. But I have Å¿ound that an accumulation of GaLvanic
influence, exactly similar to the accumulation in the common

pile, may be produced by the arrangement of single metallic

plates, or arcs, with different strata of fluids. The train of reasoning which led to the discovery of this fact,
was produced by the observation of some phenomena relating
to the connection of chemical changes with the evolution of
GALVANIC power. It appeared, in several experiments, that series of double me-
tallic plates, incapable of acting as GaLvanic combinations, when
arranged in the proper order, with portions of water, were rea-
dily made to produce GaLvanic effects, by being alternated with

acids, or other fluids capable of oxidating one only of the metals
of the series. Thus, double plates, composed of silver and gold,
(metals which have been supposed to differ very little in their
powers of conducting electricity, ) produced GarLvanic action,
when placed in contact, in the common order, with cloths
moistened in diluted nitric acid.
