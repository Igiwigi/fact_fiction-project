In figure 21 the absolute amplitudes are plotted logarithmically against R/R,, and though,
on account of the irreproducibility of absolute amplitudes already discussed on p. 28, the
scatter of the points is even worse than in figure 20, it can be seen that a straight line of
slope —h/PHr, loge 10 does not fit too badly, if 7) is given the value found from figure 20. There is some indication that the points for the indium alloys lie systematically below those
for the mercury alloys, but it is not clear whether this has any fundamental significance or
is merely accidental.

Although the changes of x with impurity are in good qualitative agreement with the
view that x changes linearly with 1/r, the fact that the linear plot of figure 20 does not pass
through the origin shows that part of x must be due to some other cause than collision broad-
ening, for if x was due to collision broadening alone it should vanish with R/R). The residual
value of x—about 1° K—must be due to other causes and Dingle has suggested that it might
be associated with a broadening of the energy levels caused by the lattice electric field; no
quantitative development of this suggestion has yet been made.
