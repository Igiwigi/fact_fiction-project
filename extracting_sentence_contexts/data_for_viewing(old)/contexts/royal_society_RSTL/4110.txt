DR. DAUBENY ON THE ROTATION OF CROPS, ETC. 181

As I proceeded however in my experiments, I began to find, that both the postu-
lates on which I had built were unsound, for neither was I able to detect any foreign
organic matter in the soil, referable to the excretions of the crop which had grown
in it*, nor did I find that uniform difference between the shifting and the permanent
crop, to the disadyantage of the latter, which I should have expected upon the prin-
ciples of Dz CanvoLLE's theory.

Moreover, the researches of Bracoxxor, which have since been made known to the
world, tended till further to throw doubt upon the truth of the facts on which the
doctrine of excretion reposed, and when no longer swayed by the authority of the
distinguished author of the theory in question, I perceived more clearly the difficulty
of reconciling it with many facts or opinions that seemed current amongst agricul-
turistsâ€”8uch, for instance, as the growth of repeated crops of the most exhausting
plants in certain rich alluvial, or newly settled countries; the continuance of a plant
in a state of nature for ages in the same locality ; and lastly, the views of L1gBrs,
which went to prove, that the food of plants, so far as their organic constituents are
concerned, is derived in all instances from the elements of air and of water.

No s00ner, therefore, had I become suspicious as to the truth of the opinion which
I bad previously entertained as to the excretions from the roots of plants being
capable of explaining the falling off of a crop after repetition, than I felt desirous of
