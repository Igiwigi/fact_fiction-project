The whole brain is small, shrunk by prolonged immersion (36 years) in alcohol,
which renders the outlines of the sulci difficult to photograph, but it has been
beautifully preserved in the Hunterian Museum. Its examination was greatly
facilitated by the kind assistance and advice of the late Professor CHARLES Stewart,
F.R.S., Curator of the Hunterian Museum, Royal College of Surgeons of England.

Adopting the principles laid down by Professor G. Rerzius (see No. 6), the present
account will consist in a systematic description of the sulci and gyri, with but
a few remarks on any apparent correlation between the cerebral morphology and
Mr. Bappaae’s psychical characteristics.

At the same time, attention may properly be here drawn to the fact that the
important neurological method of collecting systematic records of the brains of
distinguished men, which was commenced in this country by the late Mr. Joun
MarsHatt, F.R.S., requires the support of the learned Societies for its adequate
execution. Until such organised and combined action has resulted in the collection
of a large number of facts, it is impossible to make deductions of scientific value on
the relation between special mental characteristics and cerebral development.
