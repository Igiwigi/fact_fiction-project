These values are given for cobalt and nickel in a table below.

Our ignorance of the molecular state of a solid is so great that we cannot even
speculate on how it is that when 1 gramme of cobalt at 50° C. rises in temperature
to 51° C., whether it is allowed to expand freely or is subjected to great hydrostatic
pressure which prevents expansion, the energy ‘041 enters it as what may be called
the real sensible heat, and the energy ‘062 (or one and a half times as much) enters
it as some kind of energy of disgregation necessary because of change of temperature
and having nothing to do with change of volume or pressure. The facts are not
explainable by assuming that the atomic weights are wrong, because as we see from
cobalt and nickel, K approaches the value ky at low temperatures.

A table of temperatures may be made out at which for all metals the product of
atomic weight and specific heat has any constant value. Thus we take it that at
—273° C. this product is the same as it is for hydrogen or any elementary gas. At
the following temperatures the product is 2°6 times what it is for hydrogen, and the
product of K and atomic weight is in every case 6°28.
