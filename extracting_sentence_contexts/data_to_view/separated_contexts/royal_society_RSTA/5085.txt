P1-DG
discretization) and continuous piecewise quadratic polynomials are used for the pressure field
(i.e. P2 discretization). A well-known difficulty in representing solid structures as immersed in an
extended computation domain is the fact that sharp fluidâ€”structure interfaces are smeared on the
computational cells. This affects the accuracy with which forces, and hence boundary conditions,
are represented on the structure surface. A related issue concerns the computation of diagnostic
variables.
