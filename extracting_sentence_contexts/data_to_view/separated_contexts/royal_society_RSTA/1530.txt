In figure 9, we
present a comparison of our simulations and the experimental results of Ellis et al. A difference
in the wavelengths of the peaks is noticeable. This may be attributed to the fact that in their
experiments the separation between pillars is 500nm, which implies there are coupling effects
that in our simulations are not considered. First-order correction. Since our simulations do not take into account coupling effects in an array
of prisms, we cannot strictly match the conditions to validate our solver.
