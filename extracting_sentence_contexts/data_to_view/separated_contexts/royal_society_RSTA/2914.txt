Evidence of this is given
below. As will be seen later, there are indications that a form D = m+p+e/(m+a) may
be the true form, at least for certain series. These indications will be mentioned in
due course, but as the metals of Group II. are not discussed in the present communi-
cation, the case may be further illustrated from a special series in Mg, which will at
the same time serve to show that too much stress must not be laid in favour of a
particular formula on the mere fact that it reproduces the observed lines, unless the
observations are very exact, or comprise the first members and a considerable number
of the others. The series in question was first discovered by Rypperc7 in K.R.’s
observations, and consists of six observed lines contained between 5528 and 3987,
which he called a+‘ new kind of series” of the Mg spectrum. Neither his own nor
K.R.’s formula reproduce the lines, and he suggested a combination of the two, viz.,
