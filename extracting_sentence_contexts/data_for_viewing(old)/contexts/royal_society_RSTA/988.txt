various biological groups in and around the pond contributes to an overall high biodiversity
value. It is known that Green and BGI help to improve habitat connectivity and provide wildlife
corridors through urban landscapes [5,13]. There is strong evidence that the area around the
RBGE pond functions well in this respect, as many native vascular plant species have been
recorded alongside the planted exotics. Also, despite the acknowledged problems with the
water quality, the pond accommodates a number of algae, zooplankton and macroinvertebrate
taxa. Furthermore, in the area around the pond the diversity of habitats due to plantings and
landscaping, and the availability of microhabitats with elevated and relatively stable humidity,
appears to be beneficial for the species richness of native bryophytes. Application of hydrological
modelling tools is helpful for understanding the biodiversity of the site and planning further
management actions.

It should also be noted that a relatively low water quality is indicative of the fact that the pond
is trapping pollutants from the runoff. It is, therefore, acting as a retention pond, thus providing a
safety buffer for the downstream ecosystems of the Water of Leith. Further work should address
