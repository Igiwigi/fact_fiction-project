Fuchs and Schack are very explicit about how they interpret probabilities, whereas Bohr, as we DN
saw, did not give it much thought, and, if he had, he would probably have been a frequentist. But [Go
being either a proponent of personal probabilities or a frequentist does not affect what kind of iB
belief one acquires while perceiving the same outcome. ,

7. Conclusion

In many ways, Copenhagen and QBism are on the same side of the fence. Neither of them
accepts that we can have knowledge of a reality-in-itself by virtue of those cognitive mechanisms
and dispositions Nature has given us as perceptual agents. Both positions build heavily on the
evolutionary and pragmatic virtues. Bohr understood the important distinction between subject
and object, between experience and the content of experience, whereas QBism rightly points to
the fact that in the light of our Darwinian heritage the assignment of probability values is always a
matter of personal information and expectation. A compromise been Copenhagenism and QBism
could be that most of our personal beliefs are about external matters and that evolution has made
it such that our genes do not allow us to see many things too differently. Thus, our experience
in quantum mechanics is a result of information about experimental data. However, such a
compromise is not possible so long as QBism holds that the quantum state represents our personal
beliefs instead of being a tool for predictions of possible outcomes.
