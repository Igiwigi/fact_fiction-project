From the data given below Curves V. and VI. the average temperature change which
will account for a can now be calculated. ‘The mean percentage change in loss of weight

. ina is 0-018 x 100/0-41 = 4-4 per cent., and in e 0-030 x 100/0-45 = 6-7 per cent. Hence, the temperature change required is

1-31 X 0-81 x 4°4/6-7 = 0°-70 F. The agreement between this and the 0°-65 for Curve b is very close—closer, in fact,
than there was reason to expect, because the two values are for different incubators. Curve c is also for different incubators to a ; and there is besides a correction necessary,
as ¢ is for the top temperature only of the eggs, and it is the average temperature over
the whole shell that is required. DR.
