may have fully formed in a common ancestor of the six
species in which it has been found, or may have been intro-
gressed like the S. invicta supergene [55]. Recent evidence
suggests that this supergene may also regulate social poly-
morphism in many other Formica species [56]. In the
socially polymorphic sister species of L. acervorum, the
regulation of social polymorphism has not yet been studied.

Many supergenes have (like the Solenopsis supergene)
been introgressed between closely related species, including
those regulating mimetic colour morph in Heliconius [124],
floral morph in Arabidopsis [125] and apomixis in Pennisetum
[126]. The fact that a derived supergene haplotype can
spread but not fixate in one species, and then spread but
not fixate in additional species indicates the presence of
strong evolutionary forces maintaining polymorphism at
the supergene.

6. Conclusion

The regulation of social polymorphism in ants illustrates
several important evolutionary principles. Supergenes have
been repeatedly recruited to control social polymorphisms.
This may be because polymorphisms are more likely to
be genetically determined when environmental variation
