taneously takes place after the tangential dislocation is a motion of rotation about G,
the centre of gravity of the element, by which that point is not affected ; whereas the
motion with which we are here concerned, as that which alone can possibly produce any
finite differential motion, is the motion of the centre of gravity (G) itself, arising from
the general onward progress of the whole mass. Any real differential motion between
two particles must, in all cases (whatever, in fact, may be the directions of tangential
dislocation), take place in the actual direction of the motion of the particles. 'Thus, if
the directions of tangential dislocation be not parallel and perpendicular to the axis of
the glacier, as in the aboye case, the true differential motion of two particles must still
take place in the actual direction of their motion.

38. In the above case we have assumed the rupture to be complete and simultaneous
on every side of the element, and also the absence of friction between contiguous
elements. If it be otherwise, as it doubtless will be, the same reasoning will be appli-
cable; but the relief of the constraint of the mass, or of any element, at each disloca-
tion will be only partial, and the consequent differential motion will be somewhat less.
In such case the facility with which the central portions of the mass move faster than
the other parts will be diminished.
