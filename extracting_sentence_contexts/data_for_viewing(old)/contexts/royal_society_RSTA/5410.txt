Quantum-coherent energy transfer: implications
for biology and new energy technologies

The important thing in science is not so much to obtain
new facts as to discover new ways of thinking about them.

Sir William Henry Bragg
Nobel Prize For Physics, 1915

There is a growing body of scientific evidence that light-initiated reactions in
he molecular components of photosynthetic organisms can display quantum-
coherent behaviour in their dynamics at ambient conditions. In the simples
picture, quantum-coherent contributions to the dynamics of electronic excitations
imply that excitation transfer can be accompanied by superpositions of quantum
states sustaining well-defined phase relationships for times long enough to affec
ransport at the molecular scale.
