angles, so that there was no mutual induction between the members of one pair and
those of the other pair.

After the complete ampere balance was set up at the National Physical Laboratory,
further magnetic tests were made on the stand and surrounding parts by sending a
current of 1 ampere (approximately) round one of the suspended coils only, and
observing whether the rest-point of the balance was affected thereby. The same test
was made with the current reversed, and the whole repeated on the other suspended
coil. In neither case could any change in the rest-point be detected. Experiments
were also made by bringing masses of iron in proximity to the balance when the
suspended coils were carrying their normal current. â€˜The effects of these masses were
much smaller than expected ; in fact, the iron had to be placed very near a current-
carrying coil to produce any observable change on the rest-point. It may, therefore,
be concluded that there can be no appreciable error in the balance due to magnetism
or diamagnetism of the phosphor-bronze support.

Magnetic tests on marble were made at the Central Technical College in 1897,
using the large marble cylinder employed in the Lorenz apparatus constructed by
Messrs. Natper Bros. & Co. for the McGill University, Montreal.* Its permeability
differed from that of air by an amount too small to be detected.t This fact, together
with the high specific resistance of marble, decided the material to be used for the
cylinders of the proposed current weigher.
