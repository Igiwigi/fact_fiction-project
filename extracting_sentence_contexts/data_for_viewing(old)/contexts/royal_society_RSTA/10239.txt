tendency to be uniformly northerly.* The cross-section in fig. 3 of Plate 14 shows an
excess of mass to underlie Kaliinpur (Station No. 24), and this excess is possibly a
contributory cause both of the southerly deflections of the second region and the
northerly deflections in the parallel strip. The continuance of similar deflections both
to the east and to the west of Kalidnpur lead me to think that the pendulum
observations of the future will furnish on all Himalayan meridians cross-sections
similar to that given in the figure.

Geodetical observations have shown that the density of the earth’s crust is
variable, but they have not given any positive indication of the depths to which these
observed variations extend. All calculations of the effects of subterranean variations
in density and of mountain-compensation have, therefore, to be based on arbitrary
assumptions of depth. The fact that the plumb-line seems generally to respond
readily to results given by the pendulum, perhaps justifies the inference that the
observed variations in the density of the earth’s crust are not deep-seated. If an
abnormal amount of matter exists in the crust near the surface, it will exercise direct
effects upon plumb-lines and pendulums in the vicinity, but if it lies at a great depth,
its effects, especially on plumb-lines, will be less perceptible.
