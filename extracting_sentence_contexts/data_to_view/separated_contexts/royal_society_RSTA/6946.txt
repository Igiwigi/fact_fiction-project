Any finite-difference method in which
‘golutions do not steadily improve in accuracy cannot be regarded as satisfactory, since we
ave i in general no means of determining the ‘best’ interval to use, and in any case we
deannot estimate the accuracy of our ‘best’ solution.
= We note also that in all our approximate solutions the error is an oscillatory function of x. Inspection of the integral equation gives the reason for this, in that f(y) could have oscillatory
Yariation without causing great changes in the g(x). Accurate estimation of f would thus
Be expected to be difficult, and this fact has led other workers—for example, Bullard &
“Alooper (1948) and Kreisel (1949)—to consider the evaluation of some suitably smoothed
‘Zunction of f. We do not pursue these methods here, since we are concerned throughout this
