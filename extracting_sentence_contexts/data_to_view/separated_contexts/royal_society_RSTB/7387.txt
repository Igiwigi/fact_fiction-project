In the section on
‘The species of tobacco cultivated in New Guinea’ it is seen that this species is grown
by the Nogullo who live on the northern flanks of the Nassau range, and by the natives
of the Utakwa river who live up to 8075 ft. in the Nassau range, south of Carstensz
Top. So this difficulty no longer exists. The fact revealed by Van Nouhuys that J. de Menezes wintered in Geelvink
bay in 1526-7 has already been referred to, and it is possible, though there is
no evidence for it, that smoking and tobacco growing were then taught to the
natives. At all events, as Van Nouhuys points out, Schouten found that tobacco
was smoked and cultivated in that area in 1616. The piteeapnes is that this tobacco
was N. tabacum.
