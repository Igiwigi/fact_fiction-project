been expected, although less than that of a frog’s retina, Fig. 37 (1724) gives the
series of responses to light, obtained upwards of 9 hours after excision. The same
eyeball exhibited a trace of response (negative) 24 hours after excision.

The absolute value of the electromotive force of response is considerably lower on
the. mammalian eye than on the frog’s eye. I have not seen it exceed ‘0001 volt
in the former, whereas in the latter I have frequently found it to be above ‘0010 volt.
T attribute the difference to the greater size of the mammalian eyeball, and consequent
shunting of the galyanometer.

TV. Conciustons.

As regards the facts themselves, the principal conclusions are set forth in the para-
graph headings which precede, and which may be recapitulated as follows ;—

A fresh normal eyeball manifests positive current, which gradually declines to zero,
and becomes reversed (p. 126).

On exposure to light the normal current, whether positive or negative, undergoes a
positive variation (p. 127).

The magnitude of the response to light increases with the duration ot illumination

(p. 129).
