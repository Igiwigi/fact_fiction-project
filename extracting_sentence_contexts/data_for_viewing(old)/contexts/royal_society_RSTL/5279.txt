Contractile Sac or Urinary Organ (c, figs. 2, 3) —Between the rectum and the heart,
and therefore bathed by the returning venous blood, there lies an elongated,
flattened, delicate and transparent sac, whose walls are usually very much wrinkled
and sacculated.

This sac opens by a ronnded aperture in its upper part upon the right side of the
animal, and is of course continually filled by the surrounding water. As the ac is
incessantly contracting, however, this water must be continually renewed, and hence ,
the organ, simple as its structure appears and small as its size may be, is probably
a very efficient depurating agent®.

Considerations to be stated hereafter, lead me to the belief that it is in fact the
nrinary organ, at once kidney and urinary bladder.

Reproductive System.—Firoloides is dicxcious. The male may be distinguished at
once from the female, by the peculiar penis (p) attached to the right posterior
inferior angle of the body (fig. 4). It consists of two portions ; the larger is cylin-
drical, but enlarged at its extremity into a globular head, from one side of which a
small pointed process projects. The globular body contains many large cells as a
sort of lining, and within these there is a cavity which communicates with the exte-
rior through the pointed process. A vast number of small oval fatty-looking particles
may be made þy pressure to pass out from the cavity.
