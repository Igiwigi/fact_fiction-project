e method adopted by him is, as here, to find the cause of electrical phenomena in
e motion of ions. He considers them merely as volume distributions of electricity
nfined to limited spaces, and with this guiding idea determines the extension of
(XWELL's fundamental equations that will most conveniently cover the extension of
e problem to include their movements. By transforming, as in § 14, to axes of
-ordinates which partake of the uniform motion of the material system, various
esults relating to the independence between electrodynamic phenomena and such
xotion are deduced, and FREsNEL’s formula for the effect on the velocity of radiation
j shown to be involved. The conception of a molecule, electrically polar by reason of
s positive and negative electrons, of its magnetism due to the orbital motions of
ese electrons, and of its diamagnetism due to changes in the orbits, and the
Znception of conduction by a quasi-electrolytic separation, do not however occur-
And in consequence of the absence of recognition of the fact that in an unelectrified
ement of volume there are present equal numbers of positive and negative ions, the
‘lation between electromotive force and ponderomotive force is not attained.
Krofessor LoRENTz’s conclusions from his system of equations as to the untenability of
AXWELL’S scheme of stress are in agreement with the results of the present theory ;
But fiom the indications given, it is not clear that he would admit the form here
Seduced for the mechanical forcive exerted by radiation. As this memoir of Lorentz
ily came to hand after the greater part of the present paper had been developed,
phe agreement, so far as it goes, may be taken as additional evidence in favour of the
Salidity of the method of investigation that has been employed.
According to the present views, there is nothing paradoxical in the existence of
turated atoms or ions in which the tivo kinds of electrons do not compensate each
er; and the properties of these ions will be very different from those of neutral
