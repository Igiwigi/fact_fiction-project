This species, from Cretaceous (Cenomanian) rocks of Moravia, was founded by
Krassert for some fern fronds with a Matonia-like habit. M. Wiesneri agrees
closely with the Malayan fern in the form of pinnules and in the occurrence of
anastomosing veins below the sorus; the sorus appears to be indusiate and circular. KRaAssEr gives figures of a pinnule of the recent species,{ but, like other authors, he
overlooks the fact that the lateral veins are often connected by arching branches. The Moravian species differs from M. GÃ©pperti and agrees with Matonia pectinata in
the small number of sori on the fertile segments. Without entering into further discussion as to the taxonomy of Mesozoic ferns allied
to Matonia, we may briefly summarise the distribution of probable representatives of
the Matoninew.
