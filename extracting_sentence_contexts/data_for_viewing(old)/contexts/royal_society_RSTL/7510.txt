In terms of the micrometer measure we have for @ and /,
@a=103:85 turns, a'=95:7T5 turns.
The resistances were determined by Mr. HookiN as follows :

R=1 102 000 Ohms.
G=115 4612204 55

The experiments were made for two days, using a small battery charged with bichro-
mate of potash. The current due to this battery was found to diminish so rapidly that
a set of GRove's cells was used on the third day, which was found to be more constant
than the great battery. A proper combination of the two batteries would perhaps pro-
duce a current which would diminish according to the same law as that of the great
battery. Another difficulty arose from the fact that when the connexions were made,
but before the key was pressed, if the micrometer was touched by the hand the disk
was attracted. This I have not been able satisfactorily to account for, except by leak-
age of electricity from the great battery through the floor. When the micrometer was not
touched, the disk remained at its proper zero. Tn certain experiments I kept my hand
always on the micrometer in order to be able to adjust it more accurately. These expe-
riments gave a value of v much too small, on account of the additional attraction. When
I discovered the attraction, T took care to make the observations without touching the
micrometer, and took advantage of the attraction to check the oscillations of the disk.
The experiments in which these precautions were taken agree together as well as I could
expect, and lead me to think that, with the experience I have acquired, still better re-
sults might be obtained by the same method. It must be borne in mind that none of
the results were calculated till after the conclusion of all the experiments, and that the
