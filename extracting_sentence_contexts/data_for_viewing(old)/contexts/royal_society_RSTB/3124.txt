and the masses of pollen which adhere to their summits are freely exposed. In this
stage the surface of the cone is distinctly “sticky” to the touch. The pollen-masses
are held together and attached to the top of the anther by some adhesive substance,
and adhere to the finger or to a pencil brought into contact with them. It seems
unlikely that the grains are ordinarily removed by the wind. The origin of this
adhesive substance has not been investigated. It is not unlikely that it is excreted
by the papillee which stud the surface of the stigmatiform plate in which the
elongated micropyle terminates.* At times the whole inflorescence is surrounded by
a swarm of small flying insects which seem to be very definitely attracted to the
cones. Insects, apparently of the same species, were seen on the cones and also
around the female inflorescences. Attempts to capture specimens were unsuccessful.

These facts favour the view that Welwitschia is partially, if not entirely, insect-
pollinated. In further support of this opinion may be adduced (1) the narrow
entrance to the micropyle of the female flower, which is ill-adapted to catch wind-
blown pollen ; and (2) the large number of pollen-grains, which reach the top of the
nucellust (fig. 17). Hooxert found it “reasonable to suppose that impregnation
is effected by insect-agency,” though this conclusion was no doubt based upon a
misapprehension as to the condition of the ovule when pollination normally occurs.
SrrasBuRGER,§ on the contrary, was convinced that Welwitschia is at present
anemophilous, but he regarded the structure of the male flower as indicating that the
hermaphrodite flower, from which it is presumably descended, was entomophilous ;
and he even admits that, in its present condition, the conspicuous plate-like “ stigma”

“ of the male flower may be a source of attraction to insects.
