But invoking such measurement-induced disturbance was actually making quantum randomness : S
very similar to classical randomness. In both cases, the ‘real’ states are hidden at the microscopic : s
level, and the information on these states is irreversibly lost when reaching the macroscopic : 3
world. In this view, quantum measurement appeared as some sort of coarse-graining, calling 8

for the search of hidden variables and the attempt to get rid of what was called the ‘measurement
problem’ [1].

Since then, local hidden variable models have been discarded through the multiple successful
experimental violations of Bell’s inequalities [2-8], and for many quantum physicists it is now
well established that the world is non-local. In such a non-local world, quantum randomness
has a clear justification, for it prevents parties from communicating faster than light and
protects Einstein’s causality [9]. Actually, the fact that nature is intrinsically random is taken
for granted in various reconstructions of quantum mechanics, which is envisioned within the
framework of generalized probability theories [10,11]. However, the causes of randomness in
the quantum world—as well as the very impact of quantization and discreteness on the nature
of quantum randomness, are rarely discussed. Actually no alternative, physical explanation has
been proposed that would replace the Heisenberg’s microscope.

Just like non-locality, the idea that the quantum world is contextual spread since Kochen—
Specker theorem [12]. It is the purpose of the present paper to explain randomness in such
a contextual world. In particular, we aim at unveiling the causes of quantum randomness and
investigate its essential differences with classical randomness. Answering these questions is
challenging. After all, apart from fundamental indeterminism (that appears, for instance, in the
antic example of the clinamen), randomness is most often attributed to some ignorance on the
