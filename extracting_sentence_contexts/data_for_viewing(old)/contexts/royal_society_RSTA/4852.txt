with a connection to string theory noticed [7].

In retrospect, these investigations were over-influenced by the objective of finding explicit
compact contours for all channels, defined for finite-normed external fields. It would have been
more productive to concentrate on the formal momentum-space expressions, independent of
channel, which had in fact been introduced in Penrose’s original discussion of twistor diagrams


[5]. These expressions embodied a vital feature—that of manifest gauge invariance. Penrose’s
original Compton scattering diagram showed strikingly that a single diagram could embody a
gauge-invariant expression requiring the summation of two Feynman diagrams in the normal
representation. Exploration of the four-field pure gauge-theory amplitudes had extended this
observation. The extension to more than four fields was attempted and in fact the right expression
written down for five gauge fields, but verification by full summation over Feynman diagrams
seemed too daunting. Only a simplified version of this problem, double Compton scattering, was
pursued [8]. Although, indeed, the manifest gauge invariance of these diagrams was notable,
the very limited range of examples offered too slender a base on which to build a general
picture. Unfortunately, these twistor-theoretic investigations were pursued in ignorance of the
contemporary work by advanced field theorists on gauge field interactions. By using insights
from super-string theory they had found important results which completely by-passed the
summation of Feynman diagrams, and opened a much wider arena. : =
