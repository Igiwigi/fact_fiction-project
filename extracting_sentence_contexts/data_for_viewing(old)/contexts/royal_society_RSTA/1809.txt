in the frequency range of the Nottingham experiment, represented by the faded red rectangle
in figure 5, the reflection coefficient for m= —1 and m = —2 essentially vanishes. This behaviour
differs from the experimental spectrum. Indeed, in fig. 2 of [1], we see that the reflection coefficient
of the counter-rotating modes asymptotes a constant value. This value depends on the azimuthal

number and is about 0.2 for = —1 and smaller than 0.1 for m = —2. :
This observation can be explained if one does not consider the vortex core to be a purely [3
absorbing membrane, as a rotating black hole, but rather reflects parts of the waves. We therefore : =

where S denotes the fact that we have taken into account the extra reflections between the 1
reflected wave from the vortex core and the saddle point. The spectra obtained for a non-purely : §
absorbing vortex are represented by the dashed curved in figure 5 for Z=0.25. The value of : 8
Z is arbitrary and is chosen only to illustrate the result. We can see that when we consider a 1m

reflecting vortex core, the reflection coefficient spectrum does not vanish at high frequency but
rather asymptotes a constant value, determined by the value of Z.

This observation suggests that the vortex flow of the Nottingham was not a purely absorbing
boundary in the manner of a rotating black hole. From the experimental spectrum of [1], we can
also infer the value of the reflection at the vortex core for the various azimuthal numbers. In
particular, we read that Z,—-1 © 0.2 and Zm=_2 ~ 0.07.
