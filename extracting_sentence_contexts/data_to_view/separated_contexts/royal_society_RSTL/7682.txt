The difference appeared truly surprising as regards the two methods of obtaining the
same magnifying-power, especially the increased light with diminished aperture. In both these cases the greatest pains were taken to properly adjust the index collars
of the objectives for the finest possible definition of an uncoyered object. A new fact had appeared highly suggestive of further inquiry. Accordingly, distribu-
tion of power was now varied by employing differently constructed eye-lenses, especially
© crossed lenses” *, and inserting, midway between the objective and eyepiece, conver lenses
of great variety. It was now seen that these lenses, intermediately placed, developed
an entirely new aberration of a negative kind.
