diet and 29-0 °% when on raisin alone. The percentage of females in the individuals emerging
without passing through a state of diapause is 38-4 °%, compared with 59-9 % on cane-
sugar and raisin and 46-4 % on raisin alone.

With those individuals that emerge without arrested development there is a definite
difference of average developmental time betwen individuals whose mothers were fed on
cane-sugar only and the rest. The average developmental time for progeny of cane-sugar-
fed mothers was: males 17-35 days, females 18-93 days; when cane-sugar and raisin was
their diet: males 18-23 days, females 20-44 days; when raisin alone was fed: males 18-27
days, females 19-79 days. Thus with a cane-sugar diet alone both males and females showed
a definitely shorter developmental time.

These facts obviously indicate that, with all other conditions identical, the diet of the
parent female has a marked effect not only on herself but also on her progeny. Addition of
raisin to the female diet increases the length of life and total eggs laid by the female, and
also causes a greater number of her progeny to enter diapause, with a correlated increase
in the developmental time of those individuals that develop without arrest. The effect of
a different diet on the sex ratio is more complex and varies during the life of the individual
parent females, but in general addition of raisin to the diet favours the production
of more females.

(c) Variation in larval diapause with age of female at the time of oviposition

It is seen from table 8 that there is a definite variation with the age of the parent female,
not only in the oviposition rate, but also with regard to the subsequent development of her
