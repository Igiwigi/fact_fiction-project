be understood as the number of such sacrificed units when
the one unit increase can be obtained by any individual in
the group, including the focal individual (i.e. sampled with
replacement from the group, hence the superscript R). This
stems from the fact that public good production benefits all
individuals equally within the group, including the focal
actor. Since x and x® are both monotonically increasing func-

in similar ways to relatedness (i.e. decrease with dispersal
and group size; electronic supplementary material, figure
S1). From this observation and equation (3.1), we thus see
that helping and common good production evolve to greater
levels under directional selection when dispersal is weak
and group size is small, which is a standard result across
many incarnations of this problem in the literature
(see [43,44] for reviews).
