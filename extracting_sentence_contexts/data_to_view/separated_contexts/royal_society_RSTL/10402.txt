This seems natural if we are correct in 8upposing that the
energy is 80 propagated, and if we therefore cease to look upon current as merely
something travelling along the conductor carrying it, and in its passage affecting the
surrounding medium. As we have no means of examining the medium, to observe
what goes on there, but have to be content with studying what takes place in
conductors bounded by the medium, the hypothesis is at present incapable of
verification. Its use, then, can only be justified if it accounts for known facts better
than any other hypothesis. The basis of Maxwerr's Hlectromagnetic Theory. Maxwerr's Electromagnetic Theory rests on three general principles.
