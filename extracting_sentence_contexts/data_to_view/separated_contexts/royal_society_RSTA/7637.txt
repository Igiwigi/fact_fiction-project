This was done in turn with all three fluxgate
detectors placed in turn at the same position at the centre of the H coils. The values of
the compensating currents so determined were found to agree to within 0-1 mA, which
corresponds to a field of about 10y. Thus it can be concluded that the fluxgates do in
fact compensate the field as least to about 10y. This is nearly sufficient, according to the
above calculation, to keep the systematic error due to the induced magnetism of the
cylinder down to about the acceptable limit. Since the earthâ€™s field changes during even a quiet day by up to 507, and much more on
disturbed days, it is desirable to keep the field continuously compensated during an experi-
ment by means of the fluxgate.
