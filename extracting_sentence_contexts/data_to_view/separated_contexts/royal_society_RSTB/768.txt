three ribs are united to it by joints, and a fourth by fibrous tissue (p. 87; Plate 16,
fig. 217). In Stage G there is the normal number of four sternal ribs in connection
with the sternum. These facts seem to show that the costal sternum does not
originate by the union of the ventral ends of all four sternal ribs, but that it extends
backwards independently of the third and fourth ribs; meeting them in turn and
becoming united with them by joints. MDCCCXCI.â€”B, Q
