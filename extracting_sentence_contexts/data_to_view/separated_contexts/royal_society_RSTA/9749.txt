Returning now to the equation (14), and supposing that s is confined to the
interval (y, 6), we see that

f)=-feovoa/| sua. Hence, since both the numerator and the denominator on the right are
differentiable, and the latter does not vanish in (y, 8), the function f(s) is
differentiable in this interval. In fact, by applying the ordinary rules, we obtain

f'(s)=0 (y=s38). But this is impossible, because by our hypothesis f(s) cannot be constant in any
interval. We conclude, therefore, that x (s, ¢) is a definite function.
