This outer zone shows signs of having been a soft
fleshy layer outside the inner persistent one, but is too poorly preserved to describe.


STRUCTURE AND AFFINITIES OF CRETACEOUS PLANTS. 71

The inner zone consists entirely of very thick walled elongated fibres which run
partly horizontally and partly vertically in the wall. In all the sections these cells
have much thickened walls, which seems to point to the fact that the ovaries were all
approaching maturity. In one of the sections the solid centre of the ovary is well preserved and shows
a triradiate mark where the carpels join. This axile portion consists of small cells with
much thinner walls than the rest ; among them can be recognised the vascular strands.
