For this reason his
argument, that the dolomite must have been deposited in water absolutely free from
plant débris, appears to us invalid. It is true that in the bulk of the dolomite stone,
plant tissue is not recognisably preserved, and that at first sight it appears entirely
free from such structures except for very decomposed coaly fragments ; but such an
appearance is no proof whatever that plant structures were not present and
decomposed during the formation of the mineral concretions. In fact, a number of
cases can be observed illustrating this in an ordinary “ coal ball,” where the process
has taken place on a smaller scale, and in the midst of a stem otherwise preserved so
that each cell is recognisable small concretionary masses may be seen with no trace
of plant tissue in their purely crystalline structure. In such cases we know that
the water in which the mineral was deposited could not have been free from plant
débris, none the less the mineral appears now to be free from it. We need not
follow the argument further: enough has been said to show that there is strong *
evidence on the side of the view that the Wirral dolomite was deposited amidst
plant débris at the same time that the coal was being formed.
