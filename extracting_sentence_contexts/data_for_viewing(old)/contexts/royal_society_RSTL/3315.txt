Bearing this in mind, the most obvious s0lution, but I very much doubt whether
the correct one, is, that no force excepting the uniform expansion of solid matter
from heat, could raise 80 equably the surface of a great fragile mass, as the district
of Lochaber must be considered. I doubt this solution, first, because a very great
expansion is necessary, especially if we include in these movements the elevation of
the erratic blocks, now lying more than 2200 feet above the sea. Secondly, because
the movements appear to haye been of the same kind as those in the not distant
country of Sweden; and there it has been shown by Mr. Lye, that near Stockholm
an alternate movement of more than sixty feet has taken place within the human
period; and one is strongly tempted to believe that there is some relative connexion
between the areas in Northern Europe which are rising and those which are quietly
subsiding. These facts to be explicable on the theory of expansion, require, as it ap-
pears to me, far too capricious an action, in s0 s/owly and far-pervading an influence
as heat, to be admitted ; whilst on the supposition. of mechanical displacement such
difficulties are not presented. Thirdly, because (and it is my chief reason for reject-
ing the agency of expansion by itself) the movements appear to have been of the
8ame order with those now in progress in South America; and in that country the
elevation of certain wide areas, as I endeavoured to show in a paper lately (March 7,
1838) read before the Geological Society, cannot be attributed to any other cause
than an actual movement in the subterranean expanse of molten rock : to speak only
for example sake, such as would result from a change in position of those inequali-
ties in the ellipticity of the earth's surface, which seem indicated by the measurements
of arcs of meridians. It may also be inferred, from the facts given in that paper, that
the fluidity of the nucleus must be tolerably perfect. In the yolcano, even the lava
