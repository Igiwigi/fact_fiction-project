65 germs. for each of these experiments.

Upon examination I found both of these alloys to be malleable, so that the difference
between these results, as regards brittleness, is probably to be accounted for by the
fact that the slow cooling enables a fine network of crystals to form with resulting
toughness. 5

The process adopted for the determinations in the platinum-palladium series of
alloys was the following :—
~ Of each portion of the alloy to be analysed fifty grain determinations were taken
fd dissolved in nitrohydrochloric acid and evaporated nearly to dryness, these
rgsulting chlorides re-acidified with hydrochloric acid and again evaporated nearly to
Fryness.

@-The re-evaporated chlorides then dissolved up in water and the respective solutions
@ each determination diluted to about 150 ¢.¢, liquid capacity ; when cold the palla-
Gum was precipitated by mercury cyanide. The precipitate thus obtained was
