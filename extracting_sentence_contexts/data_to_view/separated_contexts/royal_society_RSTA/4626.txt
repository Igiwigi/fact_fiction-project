of B. This will continue until the
remaining liquid attains the concentration represented by b, but as soon as this
concentration is exceeded, the remaining liquid will solidify as eutectic. This will
only happen if the rate of cooling is rapid, or if the rate of diffusion is very slow, and
the concentration (x) of the alloy not far below the saturation point of the solid
solution. Once, however, that a small proportion of eutectic is formed in this way,
the meta-stable equilibrium thus established can only be abolished by the process of
diffusion through successive solid layers, and it is reasonable to suppose that this
diffusion would be still further retarded by the fact that in the formation of the
eutectic some of the B constituent has been mechanically separated ; diffusion thus
has a larger task to perform in overcoming this separation as well as in obliterating
the concentration gradient existing in the mass of the solid solution itself. On the basis of this consideration it is possible to account for the divergence
between the results of Roperts-AUSTEN and those given here. In the experiments
of Roperts-AUSTEN the rate of cooling was probably such as to allow of the formation
of layers of solid solution differing widely in concentration, with the result that alloys
lying in reality well within the limits of solid solubility showed the presence of small
quantities of eutectic.
