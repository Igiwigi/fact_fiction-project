Different curvatures of different lines are marked in the case
of bismuth, and are not easily explained, except by assuming the presence of different
kinds of molecules having different masses, the lighter ones diffusing more quickly. We have thus established a method which is likely to prove of extreme value in
separating the effects of different molecules. Our experiments also allow us to draw another important conclusion, When two
lines of a metal are of unequal intensity, it is not always due to the fact that at
any period of the discharge the vibrations which appear the strongest are really the
most intense. Our eye or the photographic film only perceives the total energy sent
out, and the time of luminosity is in many cases very different for different lines. A vibration which is weak but persists may appear stronger than one of greater
intensity which only appears for a very short time.
