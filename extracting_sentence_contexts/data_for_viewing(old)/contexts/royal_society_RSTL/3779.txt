Size is not greater than would allow of their entering by the valvular aperture; and
that in those species where the aperture is large and free, as in Palinurus, the grains
are coarse in proportion, while in the other species, where the valve is closer, they are
correspondingly fine. The circumstance of a natural structure being supplied by
artificial means is not without its parallel in the animal kingdom, and can hardly fail
to suggest the familiar example of the stomach of granivorous birds, into whick stones
are taken for the purpose of supplying the office of gastric teeth, and become essential
to the due performance of the function of that organ.

Such being the nature of the apparatus, little of explanation appears to be required
with regard to the function of its several parts.

The fact of the delicate nerve having a separate origin from the supra-cesophageal
ganglion, and being distributed in the form of a plexus around the sac, seems to pro-
claim this a nerve of special sense, more particularly as the lesser antennal nerye
passes 80 close to the sac in its course through the antenna (Plate IX. fig. 10. b.) that
for ordinary purposes the sac might have been most readily supplied from it. 'To
this sac, however, the antennal nerve sends off only one or two delicate twigs, and
those apparently for the purpose of supplying the tegument. or muscles immediately

surrounding the sac, and thus increasing the analogy between this and the portio
dura and mollis of the seventh pair of nerves in the higher Vertebrata.
