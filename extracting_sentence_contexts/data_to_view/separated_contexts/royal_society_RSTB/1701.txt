We have figured part of a remarkably fine longitudinal section from one of the
Dulesgate specimens, showing the bases of three adventitious roots, placed one above
the other in a vertical row (Plate 27, fig. 28). This specimen has the central cylinder,
including the pericyele, preserved in great perfection; the cortex, however, is almost
destroyed, so that at first there seemed to be some doubt whether the main axis
was a root ora stem. That the latter is the case is proved by the persistent cortical
sclerotic masses (sc.), which are quite characteristic of the stem, and also by the fact
that another part of the section shows a leaf-trace bundle, passing through the
pericycle. One of the three adventitious roots is seen in exactly median section. â€˜The con-
nection of its trachese with those of the primary wood of the stem is quite clear;
the root lies exactly opposite one of the protoxylem strands of the stem. The base
of the root has formed some secondary wood, which is continuous with that of the
parent stem.
