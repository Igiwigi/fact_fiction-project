to be certain of the number of segments. It is, however, unlikely that the larva
should have thirteen segments, while closely allied forms have only twelve, the
typical number in the Mycetophilidae.


BIOLOGY AND MORPHOLOGY OF THE MYCETOPHILIDAE 59

Scumrrz failed to see the six groups of sensory hairs, which are placed in direct
relationship to the imaginal discs of the legs and which have been described by
Keruin in several families of Diptera. I have found them to be constant in all
Mycetophilid larvae, including S. leptogaster. Every group consists of four small
sensory hairs of equal length. They are so minute as to require a high magnification
(oil immersion lens)—a fact that may account for Scumrrz having overlooked them.

The labium and hypopharynx are described together in Scumrrz’s paper. The
labium is said to be rudimentary and completely hidden within the head. The
description of the hypopharynx and the figures given agree with mine, except that
the membrane supported by the anterior portion of the horizontal processes is
considered as forming part of the labium. I consider this structure as entirely
belonging to the hypopharynx. The labium may be seen from the ventral surface
of the head as a semicircular chitinous plate, articulating with the free ends of the
vertical processes of the hypopharynx and supporting the opening of the salivary
duct.

Respiratory System—According to Scumrrz, the integument in Speolepta is so thin
