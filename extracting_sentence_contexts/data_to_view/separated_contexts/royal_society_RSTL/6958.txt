(43) Thus we ee that the two quantities G, T*, which are both rational integral
functions of the degree 36 in the coefficients of F(w, y), cannot one vanish without the
other, at all events when L is not equal to zero. This is sufficient to show that they are
identical to a numerical factor pres, whatever L may be, zero or not zero(®), and con-
sequently that the quantity called G, proved to be positive upon the supposition of L
not being zero, must also remain positive when L is zero, because it is in fact the square
of a rational function of the coefficients. But we may also prove this independently
by virtue of the supplementary reduced form au*+5eur'+fv* applicable to the cage of
L zero. For when L=0, G becomes JK*; s0 that the condition © G not negative” implies
8wply that J is positive unless K vanishes.
