The fact just stated, namely, that our theorem-con-
tains within itself the requisite conditions for investigating the
limits, or presumptive impossibility, of the roots, demonstrates
its sufficiency for effecting the developement of the 'real
roots, independently of any previous knowledge of R. For this
purpose, we might assumeR =0;7, 7, &c. = 1 or, 1 &c. and
adopt, as most suitable to these conditions, the algorithm of
Theorem 1I, until we had arrived at R*, an unambiguous
limiting value of z. But since these initiatory researches

seem more naturally to depend on the simple derivees, a, b, &c.
than on A, B, &c. their aggregates ; and since, in fact, as long
as 7is assumptive orindependent of R, our system of derivation
offers no peculiar advantage ; I should prefer applying the
limiting formule in the usual way ; passing however from
column to column (Woop, F 318.) of the results, at first by
means of the neat algorithm suggested in the note on Art. 7,
and afterwards by differencing, &c, as recommended by La-
GRANGE, (Res. des Eq. Num. $ 13g), when the number of co-
lumns has exceeded the dimensions of the equation.
