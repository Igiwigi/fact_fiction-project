Her appearance remains stupid, and her movements lethargic; she is still
7 savage towards her fellow Monkeys; her attention is not easily attracted, either by
» sights or sounds, although an abrupt movement or a sudden and unusual noise will
» produce signs of perception. She usually takes her food up with her hands, but is still
» markedly greedy, taking, when she can get it, much more food than a normal Monkey
- of the same size.
a After being kept under observation for more than eight months, during which she
‘pwas exhibited to numerous visitors and to the Neurological Society, the animal was
“gkilled and the brain examined.

= Autopsy.—Both superior temporal gyri are completely removed, and their place is
“occupied by a large fissure in which the island of Rett can be seen. The rest of the
Sbrain is, to all appearance, normal,

5 The brain is shown in Plate 50, figs. 12a and 12b.

= Remarks.—What is most remarkable in this case is the fact that a comparatively
SSlimited bilateral lesion of the cerebral surface should have produced so considerable a
“change in the general cerebral functions. The case of Monkey No. 6 is far less
Sstriking in this particular, because the bilateral lesion there was very extensive ; more-
over, the loss of intelligence was far less persistent, although at first not less distinct.
‘3 The experiment is quite conclusive against the localisation of auditory perceptions
gin the superior temporal gyri alone. In this case there was certainly no trace
e. remaining of either convolution, and the animal could unquestionably hear, even slight
sounds.
