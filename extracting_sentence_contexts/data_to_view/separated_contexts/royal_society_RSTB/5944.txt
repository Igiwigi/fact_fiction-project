And all this could happen without serious interference with the functional activity of
the old diffuse placenta, but as the new organ gradually became perfected in course of
time, more and more of the umbilical blood-stream would be directed into it and so it
finally came to supersede the old. That, then, is our idea of how the substitution of the more complex type of placenta
for the simpler ancestral type may have been accomplished. We must leave it to the
advocates of the simplification-hypothesis to find another explanation of the facts
established by us, and to indicate more precisely from what variety of hemochorial
placenta they consider the process of simplification to have started. By most authorities
