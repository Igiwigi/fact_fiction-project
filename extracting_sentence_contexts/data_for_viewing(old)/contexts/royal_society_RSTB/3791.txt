The chromosomes are somewhat club-shaped, with ends constantly wider than the
intermediate parts (figs. 19 and 20). The straighter portions of the chromosomes were

alone measured. Mrrk measured chromosomes from. odgonial and primary oécyte
divisions and obtained a uniform result of 0°83 as the width of the chromosomes.

The measurements for our paper were taken from first segmentation divisions. The
largest number of measurements (14) are recorded at 1°24, but nearly as many (13)
at 1'3y. Indeed, as the graph clearly shows, there is a good deal of variation in the
widths of the chromosomes of this animal. This may be partly due to the fact that
the chromosomes themselves are large, and hence the differences are more striking
and more easily estimated. It is perhaps not necessary to say that in making the
measurements we were alive to the difficulty which the form of the chromosomes
imposed,

The result of measurements of a few of the higher animals (and we might easily
have extended the list) suffices to show that the constancy of width attributed to the
chromosomes within the range of the higher forms can hardly be admitted.
