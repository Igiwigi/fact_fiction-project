but cl, approaches the corresponding co values. This is a consequence of the fact that, for small 1,
the solution at the boundaries is larger than the machine precision.
To connect these results with the theoretical analysis of (3.4), figure 5 shows the dependence of

where a is defined in (3.11). To compute f; in (6.9), we use cg, i.e. the value of c at which H’(c) = 0;
however, for determining a we calculate the eigenmodes at ch, as this value corresponds to the
point where we are closer to a quadruplet of zero eigenvalues. Table 1 shows the numerical
