Let us then consider a single electron represented by a charge ¢ moving along the
direction of the axis of « with velocity v. The components of rotation in the medium
due to its presence are at any instant — e (d/dwx, d/dy, d/dz) r~', and those of the
displacement current are derived from them by operating with the factor — v d/dzx. This displacement current is the curl of the velocity of the medium, whence it may
be easily verified that this velocity is ev (0, — d/dz, d/dy) 7—', being a circulation round
the line of motion of the electron.t The kinetic energy is thus 4 (ev)*J(y° + #) 7° dr;

* Professor FrrzGeratp remarks that it might, conceivably, resist absolute linear displacement, A

pothesis of this sort, which is on a lower plane than those mentioned above, is in fact involved in the

nal expositions of Fresnen’s dynaraics of double refraction.

which is equal to 47/3«.(ev)®, if the nucleus which bounds internally the straine
medium is spherical and of radius @ The potential energy of elastic strain in
medium is, on the same supposition, by the ordinary electrostatic formula, 4 (eY)/a
where V is the velocity of electric propagation. We assume that the nucleus of
electron has no other intrinsic inertia of its own, and no other potential energy of
own; under these circumstances its potential and kinetic energies will be of
same order of magnitude only when its velocity is comparable with that of radiatior
In that case the present formule are not applicable, except merely to indicate
orders of magnitude ; but we can conclude that, in a steady molecular configurati n
of electrons, where there must be an increase of kinetic energy equal to the potential
energy which has run down in their approach, the velocities of the constituent
electrons must be comparable with that of radiation, just as the above estimate from
magnetic data suggested.
