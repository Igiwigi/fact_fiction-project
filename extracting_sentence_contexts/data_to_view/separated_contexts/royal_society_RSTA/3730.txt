The question as to how patterns are formed is in fact at the crossroad of several fields, including
biology, chemistry, physics, theoretical mechanics, mathematics and computer science. Efforts to
rationalize their occurrence in nature date back to 1917, when Dâ€™Arcy Thompson published his
pioneering book On growth and form [1]. He unravelled some of the generic principles at work in
shaping living structures, e.g. the role played by surface tension in promoting area-minimizing
surfaces.
