and sinking of the cervical ampullae and also by the spiny papillae of the embryonic
cuticle (vide supra), serve to rupture the egg-wall in the thoracic region, and the
embryo slowly emerges out of the egg. During hatching the embryo is often bent
at right angles. Hatching has been said to depend on several external factors, viz.,
temperature, humidity, and light, but exact experimental evidence is wanting for all
of these. I might mention here an interesting observation which throws some
light on the influence of humidity on hatching. A partly hatched egg was exposed
to the room atmosphere on a dry glass plate. Owing to the rather rapid drying up
of the egg, the hatching movements soon stopped, but recommenced on moistening
the egg. This was repeated five or six times until the nymph hatched out. KinKer
D’Hercurais (1893-1905) claimed that light was necessary for the hatching of the
Moroccan Locust, and La Baume (1918) maintained that the intermediate moult
does not occur in darkness. The fact that in Locusta and in Schistocerca gregaria I have
observed both these processes to occur in complete darkness (in an incubator which
had not been opened several hours before and after the occurrence of these processes)
would appear to discount the observations of the above-mentioned authors. It
seems certain that light is not one of the stimuli which initiate the process of hatching
and intermediate moulting.

III—Summary

The development of the coelomic cavities is described in detail. Transient labral
and intercalary coelomic cavities are formed. The labial coelomic cavities resemble
the three pairs of thoracic somites in their division into a dorso-rostral, a dorso-anal,
