® reason to doubt its generic association with the less perfectly preserved skull

are both too much crushed and too imperfect to admit of the necessary

ate of this type, like that of every other described African Theriodont,
hrinaxodon, has hitherto been unknown. But it is upon the characters of
late that the order will be established, as distinct from the Bidentalia or
lontia. The palate has therefore been excavated at my request, in the
ops of the British Museum, by Mr. Ricuarp Hawt. It now shows the
fact that this type, with small and slender conical curved molar teeth, does
