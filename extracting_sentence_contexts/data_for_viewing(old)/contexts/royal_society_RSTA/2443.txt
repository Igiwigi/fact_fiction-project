blending, these reports clearly demonstrate that manipulation of the density of states might also
be a valuable path for going beyond the state of the art.

5. Broader scope opportunities

The power factor versus o plot demonstrated that meta-studies incorporating large data volumes
can lead to a deeper understanding of the materials. Going a step forward in this bearing, we
believe that high throughput screening and data science methodologies will also play a role
in the development of organic thermoelectrics. This is already becoming a reality in organic
photovoltaics, where combinatorial screening [60,61] and machine learning algorithms [62-64]
are being applied.

Stability is also a key issue that affects all organic related devices. The fact that organic
light emitting based TV screens became commercially available a few years ago suggests that


there is not a fundamental limitation that would prevent real-world application of this class of
materials. However, important issues still need to be understood and addressed depending on
each technology and its requirements (e.g. in terms of encapsulation and operation conditions).
In the case of organic thermoelectrics, perhaps one pressing need is to obtain stable doping levels,
particularly stable n-type materials. Stability here should be checked upon thermal stress, as two
of the main concerns are thermally assisted de-doping and oxidation.

Another area that may soon become important is the assessment of the different organic
thermoelectric categories through life cycle analysis (LCA) methodologies. While a somewhat
