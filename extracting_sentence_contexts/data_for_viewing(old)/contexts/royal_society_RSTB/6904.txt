at a time when the flagellate is still active, before it becomes rounded off (see
p. 460).

Penard (1921) has described the appearance of B. exilis when it is leaving the house,
one flagellum being carried forward, the other trailing. This was also described by
Kent, who states that the trailing flagellum of the free-swimming form is the
feeding flagellum of the sessile form, and that locomotion is due to the smaller of
the two anterior flagella. Penard states quite definitely that the anchoring flagellum
is trailed as a rudder in the case of B. exilis. He is here referring, however, not to the
division product, which was observed by Kent, but to the vegetative form abandoning
its house. Earlier suggestions by James-Clark that the posterior flagellum was a
contractile thread arising at the posterior end were already doubtful from Stein’s
figures. Figure Lf, sketched from life, shows that the posterior flagellum is in fact free
to its base, which lies in the vicinity of the anterior flagellum. My observations do not
confirm James-Clark’s description of a permanent groove from the base of the
anterior flagellum to the posterior end. This I regard as a misinterpretation of the
origin of the posterior flagellum.

Observations made at intervals of about 20 minutes frequently showed that the
position of the organism in the house is constantly changing. Rotation about the
axis of the posterior flagellum takes place, so that the anterior flagellum is continually
fishing in new waters. This movement does not occur continuously; the animal throws
out the flagellum in a slightly different direction on emerging from the cup after
contraction.
