of specimens, I found them in every possible stage of development, even in the same
field of the microscope. I think the last class of specimens was the largest. Now the inference I deduce from these facts is, first, that the animals from which
the first set of specimens were taken had some time prior to their being slaughtered been
placed under circumstances favourable for the production of Cysticerci (most probably
the food had contained the germs of these animalcules), but had for a certain period
been withdrawn from them, s0 that all the younger animalcules—those constituting the
vermicular stage—had been, as it were, used up to produce the adult ones; secondly, that
those from which the second set had been taken had only been recently placed under
such circumstances, and had remained 80 circumstanced up to the time that they had
been slaughtered; and thirdly, that those from which the third set of specimens had been
taken, had, both some time previously, and immediately before they were slaughtered,
been placed under circumstances favourable for the production and development of Cys-
ticerci. Now, as to the determination and discovery of what these favourable circum-
stances are, it would be necessary that the history of infected animals, giving similar
microscopic indications, should be most minutely inquired into, especially in relation to
those different periods of the disease, and that the investigation of all these circumstances
$hould be tested by a series of careful experiments upon living animals and by examinations
of their food, and all the cireumstances under which they are placed, both during the
period these animalcules are being developed in the muscles and afterwards; s0 that
negative as well as positive evidence might be obtained on the subject. In concluding this paper, the author thinks it right to append a brief reference to
the views at present entertained as to the nature and relations of the Cystic entozoa, in
order that the bearing of his own researches may be more clearly apprehended.
