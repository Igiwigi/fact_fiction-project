send out lateral branches which contain the lateral nervous offshoots ; the latter pass
out of the ambulacral pores in company with the pedicels which they serve to enervate,
a delicate nerve running along the whole length of each pedicel to terminate at its
distal end in a tactile organ.

FreDERICQ considers it probable that in their passage through the ambulacral pores
the nerves also send branches to the spines and pedicellariz ; these branches, however,
he failed to detect. The radial or ambulacral nerve-trunks terminate in the ocular
plates. The latter, however, show no histological evidence of supporting any structure
resembling an ocular apparatus; and FRepERICQ could obtain no physiological evidence
of sensibility either to solar or to artificial light, He does not state clearly what his
experiments in this connexion were, and 80 we infer thab they cannot have been the
8ame as ours. He regards the pigment spot as a * fiction.”

The nerve-ring sends off, in addition to the ambulacral trunks, the nerve-cords to
the intestine. In the ring and trunks there is no differentiation into ganglia and
fibres, but the whole is in structure uniform and in function central. The brown
colour is due to elongated and irregular cells having conspicuous nuclei filled with
pigment, and supposed to betoken connective tissue. The nervous tracts are them-
