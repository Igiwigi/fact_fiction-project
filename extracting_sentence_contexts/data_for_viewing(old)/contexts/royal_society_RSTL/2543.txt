above the sea, where it was 1004, mean temperature 78*8. My own careful obser-
vations at Poona furnish a similar anomaly. At 1823 feet above the sea the mean
oscillation for a year was greater (1166) than at Bombay, where for nine months the
mean was *0765 at the Engineer Institution ; and in my occasional visits I found it
respectively 0836 in April 1827, *1123 in March 1828, and *1141 in December 1828.
At Madras, in a lower latitude than Poona, at the level of the sea, I have shown it
to be only 0790; whilst at Calcutta, in a higher latitude than Poona, the means of
three years make it *1100. Proceeding to higher levels, however, we find a marked
diminution in the extent of the diurnal tide. At Mahabuleshwur, at 4500 feet, the
means of eight months reduce the oscillation to 0694 ; at Hurreechundurghur, at
3900 feet, the oscillation for the three hottest months was 0969 ; whilst at Kota-
gherry, at 6407 feet, it was for five months from noon to sunset only 0498. The oscil-
lation at Mababuleshwur, at 4500 feet, was in fact /ess than HumBorLpT's oscillation
at Mexico of 0708 at nearly 7000 feet.

When we pass to the other tides we find the same puzzling anomalies. The mean
rise from 8unrise to 9â€”10 a.v., whether at Hurreechundurghur, at Mahabuleshwur,
or Kotagherry, instead of being less than at Poona, is in fact greater. The mean of
three years on the level of Poona gives :0445, whilst the first place gives *0488, the
second place 0476, and the last 0490. The maximum night tide, on the contrary,

* g=m-8g, +/0592-90, 4 29m-70.
