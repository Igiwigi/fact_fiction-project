I do not wish, however, to press this
too far; if we keep in view, for purposes of comparison, the case of the
a, it will be remembered that the distinction between the seta and the
is not always a very distinct one, and this may also have been the case in
itors of the Lycopodinous series. ng now considered the first means by which greater spore-production
be promoted, viz., by increase in number of sporangia produced in ordinary
>, and having seen that it has probably been exemplified in Lycopodium and
we may consider the second, viz., increase in size of the individual
m. This may involve any one or all of the dimensions* of the sporangium ;
ie sporogenous tissue might be extended («) in a radial direction, as regards
e strobilus, or (b) in a tangential, or (c) it might be deepened, while
hg the same area on the sporophyll; or there may be various combinations
hin the genera, Lycopodium and Selaginella, the depth (c) of the sporogenous
Smains more constant than the other dimensions of the sporangium, and the
rium is, with the exception of a few abnormal cases, defined by the first
wall. There is apparently a physiological explanation of the fact that the
‘of the sporogenous mass is almost uniform; the limit is probably imposed
8 difficulty of transmission of nutritive materials upwards from the sub-arche-
= pad throughout the developing sporogenous mass: this point will not
re be considered further at present. g radial («) and tangential (b) dimensions are, however, less constant, and the
s in the genera in question are of importance as leading to a comparison
