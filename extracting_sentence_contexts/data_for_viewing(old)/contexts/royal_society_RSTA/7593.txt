being located at much lower energies. There is little certain evidence on which a detailed
comparison of theoretical and observed shapes can be made. The cross-sections fall so rapidly
from the maximum as the electron energy increases that it is very difficult to exclude
contributions from secondary effects.

Photon emission rates are extremely difficult to determine accurately, and reliance cannot
be placed upon the data presented by Thieme and Lees on absolute intensities. At 100 eV
the cross-section for the transition 1 \S' 3! P is 0-397a?, according to the measurements of the
former, and 0-497a?, according to those of the latter. In spite of the reasonable agreement
between them it is difficult to accept these values. Both would appear to be too high, since,
at the same energy, the contribution to the total cross-section from all discrete excitations is
estimated to be only about 0-37a?;+ indeed, the amount by which they are in excess would
seem to be considerable in view of the fact that the transition concerned is not the major
one, its cross-section being certainly several times smaller than that of 1 1S > 2'P. However,
it is worth attempting to extract as much information as possible from the results, as they form
the most comprehensive set that have been published; and even though the absolute scale
is untrustworthy the relative measurements on the different spectral lines should be approxi-
mately correct.

To facilitate comparison with theory the excitation functions derived from the intensity
data were reduced in magnitude so as to bring about coincidence at moderate energies in
some particular case; the transition 1 1S'â€” 3'D was chosen as most suitable for this fitting.
Table 7 gives the maxima of the cross-sections thus obtained together with the corresponding
calculated values. As can be seen there are serious differences between the columns relating
to Thieme and to Lees; and, quite apart from the presumed inaccuracies in the basic experi-
