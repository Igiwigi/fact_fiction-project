More- 3 Continuous decisions are open-world
over, the mosquito will change its behaviour based on what ;

the dragonfly does, and the dragonfly can exploit its knowl-
edge of that fact to improve its foraging. While such complex behaviour may be conceptualized as a
series of discrete choices—one choice at each moment—this
conceptualization is both facile and reductive. It misses some
of the most important aspects of continuous decisions, such
as the fact that each choice opens many new doors and closes
many others. Alternatively, one could view the choice as the
selection of an overarching strategy, but this just ignores the
important moment-by-moment nature of continuous decisions. It is best to view the decision as encompassing the entire process,
from the continuum of motor adjustments to the selection of
flight control strategies.
