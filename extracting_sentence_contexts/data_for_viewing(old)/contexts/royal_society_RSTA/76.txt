where the critical threshold is captured in terms of Vo and its initial divergence do :=
infxesupp(oo) div u(x). The main difficulty here is to control the remaining terms in Vu, beyond
just div u itself. We measure the size of those additional terms, setting

Bo:= sup max{2|dx,Uo2|,2|4x,Uo1|, |x, 401 — Ax, M02\},
xesupp(o)
and we prove that if Bg is sufficiently small then, in fact, all terms of Vu, except for div u, remain
equally small.

Theorem 2.10 (two-dimensional critical thresholds in a non-vacuum region). Consider the two-
dimensional CS system (2.5). There exist upper threshold functions o,¢ such that, if dy > o4(Vo) and
Bo < ¢(Vo) at t= 0, then Vxu(x, t) remains bounded for all (x, t) € supp(p).

On the other hand, there exists a lower threshold function o— such that, if dy <o—(Vo), |dx,Uo2\
and \dx,Ug1| are large enough at t=O, then there exists a finite-time blow-up at T,>0, where
infyesupp(p(.)) div u(x, t) > —co as t > T.—.

Remark 2.11. The smallness assumption on Bo guarantees that the terms in V ug remain small
relative to div u(-,t). Put differently, theorem 2.10 states that if the vorticity, a) and the spectral
