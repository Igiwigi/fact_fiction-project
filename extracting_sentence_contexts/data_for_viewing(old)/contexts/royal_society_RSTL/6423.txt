the male generative organs, but not in the lateral sacs. They do not, however, appear
to have any relation to the spermatozoa, and seem rather like a product, of excretion.

CHILOPODS. ;

Tithobius (Plate XVI. figs. 8-13) —In the genus Zithobius I have examined three
species—L. variegatus, L. pilicornis, and L. Stoanet.

The vulva is, as probably in all the Chilopods, situated at the posterior part of the
body; and the ovary is in the form of an elongated sac, which extends for a longer or
Shorter distance towards the head. Besides having the orifice at the posterior instead
of the anterior end of the body, the female generative organs of the Chilopods differ
from those of the Chilognaths in the important fact, that the ovary lies above instead
of below the intestine.

The eggs arise singly, each in a separate follicle, and, as L have already mentioned t0
be the case in Chilognaths, project into the general cavity of the ovary, instead of from
its external surface. They occur in the same individual in all stages, and without any
regularity, the largest and smallest lying side by side in the most complete confusion.
The ovarian wall consists, as usual, of an outer structureless membrane, while the small
epithelial cells are confined to the single stroma and the ovarian follicles.

The smallest Purkinjean vesicles which I met with were rather less than 135oth of
an inch in diameter. IT did not see any cells intermediate in character between the
ordinary epithelial cells and the smallest Purkinjean vesicles, but I am inclined to think
