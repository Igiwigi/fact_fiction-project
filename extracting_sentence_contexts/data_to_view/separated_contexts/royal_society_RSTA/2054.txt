The transformation of a certain
physical quantity, say Q, generated by the weak invariant A is defined by

AcQ={(Q,Ge}p, (3.5)

where xo
Ge =| dxe(x, t) A(x, b), (3.6)
00

with ¢ (x, t) being an arbitrary infinitesimal function on a compact support so that the integral in
equation (3.6) converges. Then, taking the action in equation (2.5) as Q, one finds

Acl={I,Ge}p
tf poo 00
= -| ar| dx (“ 5 + LILAC, 1) x | dx'e (x, t')T exp (-| ast) 5(x — x’)

Since the initial probability distribution function is fixed, the last term vanishes. Therefore,
from equation (2.11), it follows that equation (1.1) in fact holds. Consequently, the action is seen
to be invariant under the transformation generated by the weak invariant. This result offers a
reinterpretation of the variation in equation (2.10) in terms of the symmetry principle.
