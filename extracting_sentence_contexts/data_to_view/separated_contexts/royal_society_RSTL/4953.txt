that in invertebrate animals there exist two distinct
Z nutritious flaids, dissimilar in their anatomical relations, and different in their
s chemical and vital compositions ; that, in the animal series, a gradation from the
= simple to the complex is observed in the fluid as well as in the solid elements of the
> organism ; that these two constituent parts of the animal body bear towards each
: S other, whether in simplicity or complexity, a constant and direct proportion ; that
ie the true blood-system does not begin at the beginning of the animal series, but that it
arises out of (what in this memoir will be called) the chylaqueous fluid, of which the
-2 blood-proper is the perfected eyolution ; that the chylaqueous fluid is as much less
= vitalized than the true-blood, as the solid structures of the animals in which the
Z former exists are less complex than the analogous parts of those in which the latter
S is found; that the containing system of the blood-proper is distinguished, with the
E single exception of that of the Echinodermata, by the absence of vibratile cilia from
g its internal lining membrane, while that of the chylaqueous fluid is provided in the
& 8ame Situations, almost invariably, with these motive organules ; that the contents
6 of the former system are propelled by the contractile force of its muscular parietes,
S while those of the latter are circulated chiefly by ciliary vibration ; that below the
= Echinodermata the blood-proper is wholly snpplanted by the chylaqueous fluid ; A that above the Annelida the latter fluid in the adult animal is superseded by the
true-blood ; that in the Echinoderms and Annelids these two systems of nutrient
flaids co-exist, bearing always to each other, in the same individual, an inverse
quantitative proportion; that in the Mollusca these two are united into a single
system, in which the essential characteristics of both are legible; and that these
facts, hitherto unrecognised in their physiological connection, and unappreciated in
their separate meaning, are calculated to elucidate, with new clearness, the processes
of digestion, sanguification, and respiration, more especially in the lowest classes of
invertebrate animals; and finally, that they suggest inquiry from novel points of
view, into seyeral important questions in z00-chemistry. MDCCCL1I. 4H
