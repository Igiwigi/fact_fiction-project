of the bar’s gradual settlement into a cyclic state through successive loadings. After
the recovery has become fairly perfect, this considerable diminution in the total elonga-
tion obtained by a second application of the testing load does not occur. This was
clearly shown in the table on p. 29. In the present diagram Curve No. 6’ (shown
dotted) was obtained immediately after No. 6, and it shows almost no change in the
total elongation produced.

The tests made immediately after treatment at 45° C. are shown by columns
2 and 8 of the table above to have given slightly greater total elongations than
those obtained from the loadings performed immediately before warming. This is
perhaps contrary to what might have been expected, since increase of tempera-
ture has been shown to hasten recovery. But although the total elongations
are greater, the process of recovery really has been aided. This is shown by the fact ©
that distinctly smaller yieldings are obtained with low loads after the bar has been
heated to 45°C. But though the bar is more perfectly elastic under low loads, under
higher ones the yielding which occurs has not been decreased ; so that, as the specimen
is subjected to a gradually increasing load, there is a transition from more elastic
behaviour to less, which is suggestive of a yield-point.

To return again to Diagram No. IX., the specimen, after being warmed to 45°C. in
