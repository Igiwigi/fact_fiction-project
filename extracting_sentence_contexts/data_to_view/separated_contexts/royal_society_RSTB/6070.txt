For this reason,
and also because I, was united so closely with I,, it is doubtful whether in these four
apices it should be considered as an independent leaf. Instead it may be suggested
that one edge of I;, which was already at rather a high level, had extended over the
top of the central part of I,, and on the farther side had enlarged itself and organized
its own vascular strand : indeed in No. 107a, fig. 15, the vascular strands of I, and I,
formed a continuous band. This suggestion is supported by the fact that in both
the previous series of experiments on Lupinus albus (1931, 1933) it was found that
stipules which extended over the tops of wounds were often enlarged on the far sides,
while in two apices of Lupinus albus a stipule of this kind became completely separate
a little way above its insertion (1933, p. 362, and fig. 5). Or if this suggestion is not
correct, at least it is probable that in some way or other it was the close union of
I, and I, which made possible the peculiar position of Ij. VOL.
