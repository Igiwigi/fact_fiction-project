Throughout Central Africa the end of the Miocene was marked by the renewal of
earth movement accompanied by rifting. In the Rudolf area in particular it was the
cause of the folding and faulting of the Miocene sediments and lavas, thereby giving
rise to the Lake Rudolf Basin on its present site. That such movements took place at,
or just after, the end of the Miocene in the Rudolf region is known from the fact that
the whole succession of Miocene volcanics was heavily fractured after the extrusion of
the rhyolites and before the deposition of the early Pleistocene beaches, which are
locally found banked against certain of these fractures. I have therefore come to
regard the Pliocene in the Rudolf Basin as a time of earth movement and not one of
deposition, or of very marked volcanic activity. Beginning with the Losidok Range where the date of the deposits is known to be
lower Miocene from the mammalian fauna, it is proposed to give brief descriptions of
those areas, visited by the expedition, which are of particular interest.
