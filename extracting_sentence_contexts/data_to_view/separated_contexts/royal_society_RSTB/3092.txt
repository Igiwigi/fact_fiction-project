The latter figure represents one of the two sections available in this plane. It
shows the form of the wide border, and enables one to realise how similar the whole
structure must have been to a winged seed. Whether there were any biological
significance in this is not easy to estimate, but the view receives support from the
fact that special appendages occur, as Mrs. Scorr points out,* in the megaspores of
Lepidostrobus foliaceus. These admirable photographs, taken together with those of the tangential sections
already referred to, enable one to obtain a clear conception of the form and structure
of these mature sporophylls. The insertion of the sporange and ligule, the form and
scope of the velum, the course of the vascular bundle, the embryo-sac with its beak
and contents, all are revealed to us with a perfection that will surprise anyone who
recalls that we are dealing with a plant that is only known to us from the Paleozoic
rocks.
