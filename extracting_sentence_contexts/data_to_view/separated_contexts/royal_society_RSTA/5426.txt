In the field of IoT, a layered approach
can be used to decompose functional aspects. In particular, a layer known as middleware can be
used as an application enablement platform, i.e. to integrate external applications and ensure
requirements such as interoperability, persistence and analytics, context awareness, resource and
event handling, etc. In fact, loT devices are normally unable to perform resource-intensive tasks. To that end, some researchers have introduced the concept of the cloud of things, extending
the IoT with cloud computing services [30]. As already mentioned in the previous section and
highlighted in reference [30], using cloud services to enhance CPS resilience via DT requires
taking into account issues related to bandwidth, connection unavailability, latency, data validity,
security, etc.
