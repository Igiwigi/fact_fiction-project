of oxygen,
has no affinity for C, but at 1g or 20 per cent. has a very pow-
erful affinity for it, then may the oxide 4 lend a part of its
oxygen, in order to favour the combination of B, at 15 or 20 per
cent. with the solvent C. Indeed, as s00n as I saw the phosphoric
acid assume gradually a blue tinge, and the undissolved pow-
der begin to wear a more brilliant appearance, I imagined I
Should not fail to recognize the same fact in this case. When
phosphoric acid has remained long enough upon the pulverized
ore to dissolve all it can, the oxygen is concentrated, as it were,
to the amount of 20 per cent. in the part which is dissolved;
and all that which could not be dissolved has (through the two-
fold affinity of copper for oxygen, to the amount of 20 per cent,
and of phosphoric acid for that oxide of copper, at that degree
of oxidation,) yielded up its entire share of oxygen, to favour
the combinations which take place in a new order, the only one
which can exist among the substances now present.
