§ 6.—Location of Zero on the Volt Scale for COCI,.

A knowledge merely of the shapes of the characteristic curves does not enable us
to say much very positively about the kinetic energy of the liberated electrons, owing
to the uncertain and changeable contact potential difference. In fact, it is necessary
to find the position on the volt scale which corresponds to zero electric field between
the electrodes, either by a determination of the contact potential difference for some
particular case or by something which is equivalent to this. In principle the position
of the zero on the volt axis can be found from a study of photo-electric data. _Hxperi-
ments by the writer and Prof. K. T. Compron,* in which a structure similar to that used
in the preceding experiments was employed, namely, a small photo-electric source at
the centre of a large spherical electrode, have shown that the photo-electric characteristic
curves have the form shown in fig. 10. They consist of a flat part AB joined to a sloping
part such as AC or AD, whose slope diminishes with diminishing wave-length of the
monochromatic exciting light. The sloping portions all converge to a common point A
of the saturation part of the characteristic independently of the wave-length used.
A is the position of the true zero of potential difference, and, in fact, these small currents
