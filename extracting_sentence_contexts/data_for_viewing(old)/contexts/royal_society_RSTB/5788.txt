(13) The Behaviour of the First Younger Primordium.

The fact that the centre of the first primordium after the isolated primordium was
never displaced, can readily be understood. For the central part of that primordium
was situated in a depression between two older leaves (see fig. 9), and the parts of these
leaves with which it was in contact were not touched by the cut. Consequently, the
centre of the first primordium would not be expected to be displaced. On the other
hand, the stipule of the first primordium might be expected to extend beyond its normal
position towards the region above the wound, in the same way as did the stipule of the
second primordium after isolation of I,, as a result of the shift of the growing-point and
the relative lowering of the wound. And actually it was found that after isolation of I,
the next primordium (I,) was asymmetric in 13 out of 17 apices that were examined,
its stipule towards the wound being the larger (see Table II). After isolation of P,,
the next primordium (I,) was asymmetric in one only out of 20 apices examined,
probably because, as already explained, the relative lowering of the wound was not so
