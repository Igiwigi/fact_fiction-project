contractions when stimulation is made. The mixed nitrite (I.) containing a relatiy
larger proportion of pure «-amyl nitrite than (II.), was distinctly stronger than (IL
approaching near to the pure a-amyl nitrite in its action.

So far the series is regular, the effect declining with the introduction of B-nitrite; bi
on examining another nitrite (III.), containing even more (15°4 per cent.) of -nitrite
it was found that it is more active than (II.), approximating to, though feebler than
(1.), in its effect.

We are not justified, therefore, by taking the series as it stands, in recognising
relative reduction in the proportion of a-nitrite, or the relative increase in
proportion of A-nitrite as the sole cause of diminished action. Up to a certain poin
the series appears to follow this rule, but the body which, from the fact of its
containing the largest amount of B-nitrite, might be expected to prove weakest, turn
out stronger in its effect than the body containing somewhat less of A-nitrite.
examination of the relative degree of contraction produced by #-amyl and other bodie
of the nitrite series shows the former to be inferior to all the butyl (tracing 33) 7
propyl compounds, but stronger than ethyl (tracing 46) and methyl nitrites, bis:

it is to be regarded as weaker than tertiary, but stronger than secondary amyl ne i
It is also low in the series when rapidity of production of primary effect is considered.
In this respect it is equal with B-umyl nitrite, more active than normal and iso-but,
nitrite, but inferior to the rest of the group.

Tertiary Amyl Nitrite.
