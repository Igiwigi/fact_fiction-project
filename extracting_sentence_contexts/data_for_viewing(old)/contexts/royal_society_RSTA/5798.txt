temperature. The liquid films do not migrate at temperatures close to the solidus temperature,
since there is no supersaturation and thus no driving force for melting.

The formation of a typical microstructure during LFM, referred to as the particle free zone,
is reproduced by the CA simulation. It is found that the migration direction of the liquid film is
triggered by the concentration fluctuations that set a concentration gradient which in turn leads
to diffusion away from the trailing (solidifying) interface towards the leading (melting) interface.
The liquid droplets ahead of the leading interface are absorbed by the liquid film when the liquid
film sweeps through the solid matrix. The liquid solidifying at the trailing interface forms a region
free of liquid droplets. The simulated microstructure behind the migrating liquid film showing
a particle free zone agrees well with experimental observations. It is also found that the solid
concentration in the particle free zone is lower than the initial composition; essentially it is the
equilibrium solid concentration, due to the fact that the resolidification at the trailing interface
occurs with local equilibrium. Simulated concentration profiles across the migrating liquid film
agree well with experimental quenched liquid films.

CA simulation calculations are performed regarding the evolution of microstructure and
composition field for an Al-4wt.%Cu alloy with an initially equiaxed grain structure in a
temperature gradient. The LFM effect is considered in the simulation. The simulated grain
structure becomes coarser and highly elongated during annealing. LFM is considered to strongly
contribute to such grain structure changes. The lateral grain width increase is solely controlled by


LEM, while the grain elongation in longitudinal direction is attributed to both LFM and TGZM.
It is found that the grains with higher concentrations are swallowed by the adjacent grains with
