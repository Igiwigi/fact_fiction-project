362 MR. J. BARCROFT AND OTHERS: OBSERVATIONS UPON THE EFFECT OF .

Apart, however, from small differences such as might be attributed, rightly or
wrongly, to experimental error, the main facts stand out: (1) that there is no
suggestion of oxygen pressures of 90-120 mm., such as have been alleged to exist in
dwellers at high altitudes ; (2) that the pressures of oxygen in the arterial blood are
such as would naturally be brought about by diffusion, but which would only be
produced accidentally by any other mechanism, It is very improbable that so many
consecutive accidents should occur.

The low order of oxygen pressures ruling in the arterial blood is in general agree-
_ ment with the low percentage saturations of oxygen found in blood withdrawn by
direct arterial puncture.

Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the Table given below is the high degree
of unsaturation of the arterial bloods of those native to the mountains. The three
