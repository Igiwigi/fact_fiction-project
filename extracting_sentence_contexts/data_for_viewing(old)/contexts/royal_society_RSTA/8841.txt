The interpretation of the effect of Dioné and Rhea on the inner parts of the ring
is not clear. From the theory one would expect that any satellite could affect a
clearance of particles from the origin up to a radius given by a/a’ = 01712. In that
case Titan, the largest of the satellites, should dissipate the whole of the existing
rings, for this ratio carries us far beyond the outer radius.

There are therefore two facts to explain. First, the existence of the Crépe Ring
within the dissipative area of Rhea, and second, the existence of the bright rings
within the dissipative area of Titan. In connection with the first, LowEit has noted
a definite black band within Ring B, so that there is a clearance of particles between
the Crépe Ring and the bright rings. It would appear as though the dissipative
power of the satellites was only effective near the outer boundary of the unstable
area about the origin. To discuss this, let as examine the analytical results.

It has already been pointed out how very small the exponent ¢ is, as given by (18),
indicating a very slow rate of dispersion. Consider, instead, the numerators of the
expressions (24), the vanishing of the denominators of which causes the instability.
The numerators are small because of the quantities O,,, and 0,,,,. In the case under
discussion, m = 1. From (5)
