Compared with the higher apes the anterior contour
of the frontal lobes is somewhat blunter and the orbital margin appears fuller ; never-
theless from this aspect the cast of Sinanthropus is distinctly simian. Unfortunately
the edge of the orbital margin is missing in Pithecanthropus except for a small part on
the right side. It is probable, in virtue of the fact that the lateral contours are so
similar, that there was a frontal keel as pronounced as in Sinanthropus. The anterior
view of the cast of Pithecanthropus is definitely blunter in appearance than that of
Sinanthropus. There is an antero-external angle placed only very little behind the
level of the most anterior point of the cast; this angle is only very faintly indicated
in the cast of Sinanthropus where the superciliary margin passes uninterruptedly into
the orbital margin.
