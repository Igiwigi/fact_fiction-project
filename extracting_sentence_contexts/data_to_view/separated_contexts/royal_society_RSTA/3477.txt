In the first curve, starting from the left of the
diagram, each unit of the ordinate represents 10° ampére; in each succeeding
curve as we pass to the right the value of the ordinate is successively multiplied
by ten, so that in the last curve each unit is equal to 10~> ampére. To obtain the
saturation current per unit-area the values on the curve have to be multiplied
by 2°5. The curves show that the negative ionisation increases very rapidly with the
temperature of the wire (in fact the saturation current varies roughly as the 70th
power of the absolute temperature). It will be seen that the current never vanishes
absolutely, but only in an asymptotic manner, so that it should be observable at any
temperature provided sensitive enough instruments are employed. As a matter of
fact at low temperatures it would of course be masked by other effects, which become
large by comparison.
