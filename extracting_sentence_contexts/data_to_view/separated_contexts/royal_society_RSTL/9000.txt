That is to say, I arrive at this conclu-
8ion regarding the cases in which such apparent coordination is observable only because
in other cases such apparent coordination is 20t obseryable, and also, I may add, because
my experiments in section have not revealed any evidence of neryous connexions capable
of conducting a stimulus-wave with greater rapidity than a contractile wave, I there-
fore consider this conclusion an uncertain one ; and its uncertainty is perhaps still fur-
ther increased by the result of the following experiments. If a covered-eyed Medusa
be chosen in which perfectly synchronous action of the ganglia is observable, and if a
deep radial incision be made between each pair of adjacent ganglia, the incisions being
thus eight in number and carried either from the margin towards the centre or vice
vers, it then becomes conspicuons enough that the eight partially divided segments
no longer present synchronous action ; for now one segment and now another takes the
initiative in starting a contractile wave, which is then propagated to the other segments. And it is evident that this fact tends to negative the above explanation ; for if the dis-
charges of the ganglia are independently simultaneous before section, we might expect
them to continue 80 after section. It must be remembered, however, that the form of
section we are considering Is a severe one, and that it must therefore not only give rise
to general shock, but also greatly interfere with the passage of contractile waves, and, in
general, disturb the delicate conditions on which, according to- the 8uggested explana-
tion, the previous harmony depended. Besides, we have before seen that for some reason
or other segmentation of a Medusa profoundly modifies the rate of its rhythm.
