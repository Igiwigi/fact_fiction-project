There is again no indication of any close affinity between the Dipnoi and, at any
rate, existing Ganoids. Like the Ganoids, the Dipnoi are no doubt remnants of a very primitive stock ; bub
in the conversion of the air-bladder into a true lung, the highly specialised character
of their limbs? their peculiar autostylic skulls, the fact of their ventral nasal openings
leading directly into the mouth, their multisegmented bars (interspinous bars),
directly prolonged from the neural and hamal arches and supporting the fin-rays of
the unpaired dorsal and ventral fins, and their well-developed cerebral hemispheres,
very unlike those of Ganoids and approaching the Amphibian type, they form a very
well-defined group, and one very distinctly separated from the Ganoids. No doubt the Chondrostean Ganoids are nearly as far removed from the Teleostei
as from the Dipnoi, but the links uniting these Ganoids with the Teleostei have been
8 fully preserved in the existing fauna of the globe, that the two groups almosb run

* As instances of this we may cite (1) the spiral yalye; (2) the frequent presence of a spiracle; (3)
the frequent presence of a communication between the pericardium and the body-cavity; (4) the hetero-
cereal tail,
