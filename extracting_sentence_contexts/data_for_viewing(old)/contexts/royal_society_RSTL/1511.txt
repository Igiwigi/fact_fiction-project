85, or as 2 to 1. And though Arcturus still remains a star
that moves with great velocity, yet in the XIth Table we
have 4, or 5 stars with nearly as much motion ; and 4, with
more.

Our solar motion also removes the deception by which the
motion of a star of the consequence of  Orionis is 80 concealed
as hardly to show any velocity ; whereas by computation we
find that it really moves at a rate which is fully equal to the
motion of the s1m.

I must now observe, that the result of calculations founded
upon facts, such as we must admit the proper motions of the
$tars to be, should give us some useful information, either to
satisfy the inquisitive mind, or to lead us on to new disco-
veries. The establishment of the solar motion answers both
these ends. We have already seen that it resolves many dif-
ficulties relating to the proper motions of the stars, and
reconciles apparent contradictions ; but our inquiries should
not terminate here, We are now in the possession of many
concealed motions, and to bring them still more to light, and
to add new ones by future observations should become the
constant aim of every astronomer. _

This leads me to a subject, which though not new in
