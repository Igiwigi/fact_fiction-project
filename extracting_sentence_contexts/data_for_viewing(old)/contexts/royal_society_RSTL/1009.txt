ammonia.

I made a similar experiment with a portion of the same
water in the tubes of agate that had been $0 often used, and


chemical Agencies of Electricity. 9

I had the pleasure of finding | the‚Äù results precisely the
same.

To detail any more operations of this kind will be unne-
cessary ; all the facts prove that the fixed alkali is not gene-
rated, but evolved, either from the solid materials employed,
or from saline matter in the water.

I have made many experiments in vessels composed of
different substances, with the water procured by very slow
distillation : and in almost every instance some fixed alkali
appeared.

In tubes of wax the alkaline matter was a mixture of soda
and potash; and the acid matter a mixture of sulphuric,
muriatic, and nitric acids.
