10. Equation (25) is derived from the boundary conditions (20) by elimination of the
arbitrary constants A, B, C, D,—i.e., of the three ratios B/A, C/A, D/A. Any three of
the boundary conditions will serve to determine these three ratios, and the fact that (25)
has been satisfied implies that the fourth boundary condition will be consistent with the
values so found. Thus it was a straightforward (although lengthy) matter to determine
the ratios appropriate to any point in the curves of fig. 6, and thence to determine the
appropriate forms of Vy and ‘Vy.
