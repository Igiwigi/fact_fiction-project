music across cultures that may be challenging for traditional
symbolic models.

One interesting feature of vector grammars is that they are
computationally more expressive than their symbolic
counterpartsâ€”in fact, they result in an entirely different


class of complexity that is not comparable with the models of
the CH from which the models originated (this is due to the
large amounts of information that the large real-valued vec-
tors may carry). For instance, Rodriguez [157] demonstrated
that a right-branching vector grammar (or, in fact, its special
case, the Elman network [150]) can generate several context-
free languages, even though it is well-known that right-
branching symbolic grammars are finite-state. The reason is,
Rodriquez argues, that small displacements in a continuous
vector space can be used to implement a counter. We may
expect that also other classes of symbolic grammars can be
approximated by vector grammars with very simple structure
(even if the non-terminals are in some sense more complex).
While much theoretical work exploring their expressive
power is still necessary, they provide another motivation to
move on to probabilistic, non-symbolic models that move
beyond the constraints of the CH.
