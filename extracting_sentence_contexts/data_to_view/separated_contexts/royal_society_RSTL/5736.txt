Hamiron of Santa Cruz, that when the autumn set in there below in November,
as it had done above in September, it brought S.W. wind, rain, and snow with it, and
80 much electricity, that a house in Orotava was destroyed by lightning.

(9.) Alta Vista Storm of September 14th. From August 30th a decided change from the long-continued routine of the summer
weather took place; a cirrous cloud formed on the Peak that day, immediately aboye -
our heads at Alta Vista; and the appearance of the fibres of misty cirri dissolving, |
reforming, and driving over the mountain top, was dazzlingly beautiful. IT have had |
abundant experience of ordinary clouds on mountain tops, under 6000 feet in height;
but they were always dull foggy mist, in fact Newrox's © grosser clouds;” and I can -
therefore 8peak positively to this * cirrous ” cloud on the Peak being something unusual
in its nature and mode of composition. A strong S.W. wind blew subsequently for
three days; and though the weather settled again, we could not but be struck with the
change that had occurred in the N.K. cloud. Still it formed its usual stratum at about
4000 to 5000 feet high, but its long rolls of cumuloni were broken up into separate and
distinct cumuli ; and on the south side of both Teneriffe and Grand Canary we could see
sImilar bodies of clouds advancing from the S.W., climbing the steep sides of the island,
and contesting the possession of the ridges day after day with the N.E. clouds.
