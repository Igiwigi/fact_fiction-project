The arm
Length, however, increases steadily in value with the temperature. The effect
raising the temperature from 11°4 to 159, or an interval of only 4°°5, is
most remarkable, as the arms are thereby nearly trebled in length, The Echinus
plutei appear to react differently from either of these species, as in them the body
ength reaches a maximum at 20°-4, whilst the arm length is but slightly affected by
the rise of temperature. Probably the body length is as a matter of fact affected to
bout the same extent as that of Strongylocentrotus plutei, the differences in the
ult at 20°°4 and 23°7 in the two cases falling within the limits of experimental
Arror. This difference in the reaction of growth to temperature which is so marked in the
ease of the Strongylocentrotus and Spherechinus plutei must obviously be another
powerful check to the complete fusion of the parental characteristics in the crosses
between the two forms, though it would probably not be so great a difficulty to over-
come as that of the difference in rate of growth under constant conditions.
