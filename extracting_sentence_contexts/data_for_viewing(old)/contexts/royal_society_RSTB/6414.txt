(1926), Storry (1928), and others. Their viruses, however, appear to have a
different type of relation to their vectors (see p. 484). The suggestion of an incubation
period in the insect for Hy. III made in my previous paper Hamitron (1932) was due
to small numbers of plants having been used at a season of low percentage infection,
so that only their periods of maximum infection at 24 and 48 hours gave positive
results.

Hocean (1933), using cucumber mosaic, did not find any difference in percentage
infection for feeding periods of from } hour to 24 hours on the healthy plant. This
may be due to differences in the nature of cucumber mosaic and Hy. III, but it is
also possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids, 10 or 20 per
plant, were used so that the increase per hour would be relatively small.

The shape of the curves is of interest in that the upper pair of lines are straight and
probably do not pass through zero ; the regions corresponding to the shortest times
in the lower pair are curved and might conceivably do so.

In order to find out the effect of shorter feeding periods another series of experi-
ments was carried out between September, 1934, and January, 1935. The treatments
consisted in culturing groups of 1 and 5 aphids on to batches of 5 plants each and
allowing them to feed for periods of }, 4 (for single aphids only), 1, 3, 6, and 12 hours.
Some short term infections had already been done for 5 aphids in the summer of
1934 and these are included in the 5-aphid results. The results are given in Table IX
