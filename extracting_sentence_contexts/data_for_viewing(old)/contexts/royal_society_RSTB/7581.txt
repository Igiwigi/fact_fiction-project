forty-one recaptures were made between November and June 1938. In the same period
sixty-seven recaptures were made from the forty-seven animals, of lower average age,
which were released in September. The total recapture rate is 1-4 for both samples,
although the older animals had been exposed to risk for an extra 7 weeks. Moreover, the
September sample included thirteen August-marked animals and if these individuals are
separated from the thirty-four new animals the contrast is greater. Table 13 compares
recapture rates in this way between voles first caught in August and those captured and
released under identical conditions each month. Periods for which the relative rate of
recapture of August animals exceeds an arbitrary ratio of 1-5 are shown in heavy type.
The odds against getting any one of these results by chance alone are not very great, and
since none of the comparisons is independent the results of y? tests may not be pooled.
Therefore by familiar statistical tests these differences are of no significance. Nevertheless,
it would be incorrect to dismiss the view that the survival rates did in fact differ and that
by January there were relatively less survivors from the later samples. On block Â£,
where the whole population declined more rapidly (tables 12 and 17), six out of eight
August-marked voles were retaken in November compared with only eight out of the
nineteen new animals also released in September. Other data are too scanty for analysis.

Sex. Table 14 shows that fewer males than females were recaptured from those released in
March, the difference almost being statistically significant (y2= 3-81, + 0-05). In addition,
fewer males than females were recaptured from those released in February and May,
