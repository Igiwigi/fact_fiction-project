purchased, Any irregularity in the annealing, or any imperfections analogous to
what workmen call pins in pieces of steel, will thus be rendered yisible to the eye, by
their action upon light, The places marked out by these imperfections, are those
where the glass almost always breaks when unequally heated, or when exposed to a
Slight blow, Hence, glass-cutters would find it of advantage to submit the glass to
this examination before it undergoes the operations of grinding and polishing.

Â®* Since the preceding Jetter was written and sent to Sir Joszyn Banxs, I have
learnt that M, SeeBEeck has published in a German Journal for Dec. 1814, an account
of some experiments similar to those contained in Sect, II, of this Paper. As there is,
$0 far as I know, only one copy of this Journal in England, in the possession of Dr,
THomsoN, I haye not been able to obtain a sight of it, in order to compare M. Sex-
BECK*s reSults with mine, I understand, however, that he has discovered the fact,
that a plate of red hot glass often acquires, in cooling, the depolarising structure, and
that the tints depend upon the mode of cooling the glass. This result, however, has
no connection whatever with the new properties of heat unfolded in the first Section
of the preceding Paper, and does not anticipate the developement of the phenomena
contained in the Second Section, 'The discovery of the new property of heat was made
by me early in 1814, and an account of it was read before the Royal Society on the
19th of May, 1814. See Phil, Trans. 1814s p. 436-
