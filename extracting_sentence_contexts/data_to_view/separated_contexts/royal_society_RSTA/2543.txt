These experiments
cannot be regarded as conclusive, for there is a possible cause of the electron emission
which has not been considered, namely, that it arises from an action between the
metal filament and gases contained in it. In testing the second hypothesis mentioned
above, RicHarpson considers only the possibility of chemical action between the
metal filament and the gas surrounding it. The fact that the thermionic emission
from a hot wire in a good vacuum decreases on driving out the gas by long continued
