i In this case the ratios are such as to show that the rate of flow 1s more nearly
proportional to the square of the radius than to the radius itself. The fact that
in the first column of ratios an increase is shown from above downwards, but in the
second a decrease indicates that the rate of flow varies as a power of the radius
lying between one and two, and nearer to the latter than the former. Since,
however, the force impelling the water in each case cannot be estimated, and was
not always necessarily the same, some such divergence is to be expected. Section 8.—The Relation between the Length of the Stem and the Rate of Flow.
