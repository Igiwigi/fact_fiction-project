problem: given a nonlinear partial differential equation, can we fit it into the context above (or an
analogous context) and solve it for arbitrary initial data by solving the corresponding three linear
equations above in turn?

Briefly and formally, keeping technical details to a minimum for the moment, a simple example
that addresses these issues, answers these questions positively and outlines our proposed
procedure is as follows. Suppose Q is a closed linear subspace of L7(R;R?) and that P is the
complementary subspace to Q in the direct sum decomposition 1?(R;R*) =Q oP. Suppose for
each t €[0,T] for some T >0 that Q= Q(t) is a Fredholm operator from Q to Q of the form
Q=id+Q’, and that Q’ = Q(t) is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator. Further we assume P(t): Q— P
is a Hilbert-Schmidt operator for t € [0, T]. Technically, as mentioned above, we require Q’ and P
to exist in appropriate subspaces of the class of Hilbert-Schmidt operators. However, we suppress
this fact for now to maintain clarity and brevity (explicit details are given in the following
sections). With this context while they exist, Q’ = Q’(f) and P = P(t) can both be represented by
integral kernels q’ = q'(x,y;t) and p = p(x, y;t), respectively, where x,y € R and t € [0, T]. Suppose
that D = 02 and B = 1 so that the base and auxiliary equations have the form

p(x,y;t) = dzp(x,y;t) and aq/(x,y;t) = p(x, yt).

The linear Riccati relation in this context takes the form of the linear Fredholm equation,

We can express this more succinctly as p=g+gx«q' or p=gx(5+q'), where 5 is the identity
operator with respect to the * product. As described above in the ‘abstract’ operator-valued
