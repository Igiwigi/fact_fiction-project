When this experiment is made
in a glass tube hermetically sealed, no gas is liberated if
the tube is opened under mercury ; but when it is made in a
tube connected with a mercurial apparatus, a small quantity of
sulphuretted hydrogene is evolved, so0 that the phenomena
are similar to those produced by the union of sulphur with the
metals in which sulphuretted hydrogene is likewise disengaged,
except that the ignition isstronger.* When the union is effected

* The existence of hydrogene in sulphur, is rendered very probable by the ingenious
researches of M, Berthollet Jun. Annales de Chimie, Fevrier 1807 page 145. The fact is
almost demonstrated by an experiment which I saw made by W, Clayfield, Esqat Bristol,
in 1799, Copper filings and powdered svIphur, in weight in the, proportion. of three


by of the fixed Alkalies. 17

in the atmosphere, a great inflammation takes place, and sul-
phuret of potash is formed. The «ilphuretted basis Iikewise
gradually becomes oxygenated by exposure to the air, and is
finally converted into <ulphate. The new substance prodaces some extraordinary and beau-
tifal results with mercury.
