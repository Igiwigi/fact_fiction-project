In the first place it appears that, in a general sense, the number of the spores
is not always inversely proportional to their size. It may at first sight be assumed,
without reference to sequences of descent, that there is a constant inverse proportion
between the size of the spore and the number produced; as evidence it may be

quoted how RauwENHorr* states that the spores of Gl. flabellata are the smallest
which he has measured, while we now see that this same species has the largest
numerical output observed hitherto among Leptosporangiate Ferns. But the fol-
lowing facts show that an inverse proportion of size and number is not constant.

The smallest spores measured were those of Trichomanes pinnatum (0°026), which
has only 32-48 per sporangium; while conversely the largest, e.g., those of Lygodium
pinnatfidum (0°08), and Javanicum (0°075), Mohria caffrorum (0:077), of Hymeno-
phyllum dilatatum (0°06), and Trichomanes reniforme (0°054) are produced in numbers
which equal, or even exceed considerably the output in other allied cases where the
spores are of smaller size, such as Lygodiwm dichotomum (0-063), Anemia phyllitidis
(0°049), Hymenophyllum Wilsoni (0°033), Trichomanes radicans (0°03), and spicatum
(0°033). But though from these cases it is sufficiently proved that this inverse
proportion will not apply in a general sense, still in specific cases, and within circles
of near affinity, such an inverse proportion may at times be clearly traced, and
there can be little doubt that it is a factor in the problem; it is, however, closely
