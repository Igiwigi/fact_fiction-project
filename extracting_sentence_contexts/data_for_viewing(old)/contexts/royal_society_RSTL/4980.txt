I may observe that this change of state in the endochrome, although striking at firs
Sight, is not uncommon in the sporidia of Spherie, and it is a circumstance which
must always be carefully attended to when the form and structure of the sporidia are
resorted to for distinguishing species. In this instance the difference between what
may be called the nucleate and the granular sporidia is 80 great, that they might at.

The fact of these cilia being invisible in the ascus might seem to point to germination

almost preclude this supposition. L

The above varieties in the sporidia are not,” however, the main peculiarity the
fructification of this Spheria, for I have found its perithecia producing in lieu of the
