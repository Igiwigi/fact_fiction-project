activated cell sorting (FACS).

The length of the transcriptome, T, in base pairs, is calculated as follows:

(i) The amount (nanograms) of added spike-in standard was converted into molecules
spike-in in nt using the molecular weight and nucleotide length of the spike-in and the
Avogadro number.

(ii) The total amount of mRNA to which the spike-in was added was converted into nt using
the molecules of spike-in (nt) and the sequencing reads mapped to the transcriptome and
spike-in standard.

(iii) The total mRNA length (nt) was divided by the cell number quantified by FACS to
calculate the total length (T) of the trasncriptome per cell. 1.81 x 10° + 2.4 x 107, 7.84 x
108 + 1.21 x 107, 1.52 x 10° + 2 x 107 and 4.72 x 108 + 7.3 x 107 was the total number of
cells in LB, MM, under heat or osmotic stress, respectively.

(iv) Finally, to calculate the copy number of each gene, we multiply the rpkMd values of each
gene C;/CL by T (equation (2.1)).

(g) Differential gene expression and GO analyses

The number of raw reads unambiguously aligned to ORFs in both RNA-Seq and RPF datasets,
for each condition, were normalized by the median of the total number of reads aligned to all
ORFs, which gives more stable normalization [20] and is more suitable for differential expression
