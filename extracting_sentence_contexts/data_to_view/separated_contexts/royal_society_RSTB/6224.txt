RICHARDSON ON THE SECRETORY

In the first place, BRAMBELL assumes that all the epithelial cells are ciliated and
similar in type throughout the uterine secretory cycle. He fails to distinguish the
basal cells as passing through a short phase of special secretion (probably associated
with cuticle formation) during which vacuoles and heavily staining pro-secretion
granules appear in the cytoplasm. In an addendum to his paper, he refers to his
disagreement with Turcuint (1924) that two separate cell-types are present and, in
fact, states elsewhere that the entire epithelium of the oviduct is made up of one
type of cell which may degenerate and desquamate during the passage of the egg. More recently, Braptey (1928) has independently shown the existence of the non-
ciliated gland cells in the cranial portion of the uterus, as elsewhere in the oviduct. Quite apart from his non-recognition of the existence of two cell-types with distinct
glandular phases in the uterine epithelium, BRAMBELLâ€™s view that the Golgi
apparatus is extruded from the cell is difficult to confirm.
