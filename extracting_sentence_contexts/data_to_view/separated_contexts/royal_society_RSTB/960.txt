The weak chemical union between the nitrites
and certain constituents of blood and muscle, of which their physiological action
affords indications, although substantiated to some extent as regards the blood by the
eexperiments of GAMGEE, requires detailed chemical study with respect to the nature
â€˜we the compound, as well as to its modes of decomposition. 2 In conclusion, the following are the principal facts which have been established with
Zeference to the connection between the various phases of the physiological action of
Ahese nitrites and their chemical constitution. S In respect of all phases of the physiological action, the secondary and tertiary
Sitrites are more active than the corresponding primary compounds.
