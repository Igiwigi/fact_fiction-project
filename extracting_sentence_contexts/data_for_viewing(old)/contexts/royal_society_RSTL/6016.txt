or, reducing by the equation z—oy=0, a;=ay(a*—2), y=—y(@a*—2?), 2=0, or, what

is the same thing, z,+oy,=0, 2z,=0; that is, the point (#,, y;, 21) is one of the points of
inflexion. This is the construction of the sextactic points obtained by PLUCKER and
STEINER.

40. Reverting to the equation of the line joining the point of contact of the five-
pointic conic with the point of simple intersection, this meets the cubic in a third point,
and Mr. SALMON has shown that this third point is in fact the second tangential (tan-
gential of the tangential) of the point of contact, or, what is the same thing—


CONTAOT AT ANY POINT OF A PLANE CURVE. 391

Theorem. —The point of simple intersection of the cubic and the five-pointic conic is
the third point of intersection with the cubic, of the line Joining the point of contact,
with the second tangential of this point.

41. I have not sought to yerify this theorem by my formulee. IT remark, that com-
bining it with the before-mentioned theorem, the five-pointic conic is completely deter-
mined as follows ; viz.—
