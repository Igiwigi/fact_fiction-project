On-bottom stability design of subsea pipelines
One contribution of 12 to a Theme Issue transporting hydrocarbons is important to ensure
safety and reliability but is challenging to achieve
in the onerous metocean (meteorological and
oceanographic) conditions typical of large storms
(such as tropical cyclones, hurricanes or typhoons).
This challenge is increased by the fact that industry
Subject Areas: design guidelines presently give no guidance on
ocean engineering how to incorporate the potential benefits of seabed
mobility, which can lead to lowering and self-burial
of the pipeline on a sandy seabed. In this paper,
