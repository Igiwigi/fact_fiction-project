buted by them to a supposed difference in the length of the fibres compoxsing the different
portions of it, rather than to the position and direction of the fibres themselves, which
appear to me to afford the true explanation. The fibres of the second layer further
differ from those of the first in their arrangement at the base, most of them being con-
tinuous in this direction with the fibres of the sixth layer (Plate XII. fig. 6, 0 n). The
continuity of the fibres of the second external layer at the base with corresponding
internal fibres, is strictly analogous to the continuity of the external fibres with the
internal ones at the apex—the only difference being that at the apex the external fibres,
in order to become internal, involute or turn in, whereas at the base the internal fibres,
in order to become external, evolute or turn out. That the same principle which turns
in the external fibres and secures their continuity with corresponding internal ones at
the apex, also turns out the internal fibres and renders them continuous with correspond-
ing external fibres at the base, is probable from the fact, that the borders formed by the
union of the external with the internal fibres at the base and at the apex are convex, and
identical as regards structure ; in other words, the fibres composing both borders advance
spirally, the external fibres winding from above downwards and bending oyer the circular
edge, forming the apicial orifice in a direction from without inwards (Plate XII. fig. 11, kt,
and Plate XVI. fig. 55, ef), the internal winding from below upwards and bending over
the convex border surrounding the auriculo-ventricular or basal orifice in a direction
from within outwards (Plate XII. fig. 7, n/, and fig. 8, o'). The borders which limit the
ventricle towards the apex and the base when the first layer is remoyed are consequently
compoxed of loops or doublets of fibres (Plate XVI. fig. 55, ef, and Plate XV. fig. 47 d).
Dr. Jonx Rm, in speaking of the left apex, says, © when the point is removed the
circular edge is left entire, and is formed of another series of fibres, which, like those
taken away, adyance spirally from the base to the apex, and turning over the edge ascend
