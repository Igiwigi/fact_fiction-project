derivatives had very strong impact on the way of thinking in fractional calculus, that even
fractional integrals were routinely discretized on equidistant grids, too. However, it is clear
that for fractional integrals it was not a necessity at all. On the other hand, it was unclear

Second, solution of fractional differential equations in large time intervals is a computational 1
problem due to the fact that the number of points taken into account in computations grows with : >
the growing value of the time variable. This is caused by the non-local character of fractional- :3
order differentiation. So far, the only aid in this respect was the ‘short memory principle’ 18
[1]. Methods known from classical numerical solutions of integer-order differential equations, : s
especially variable-step-length techniques, were not available for fractional differential equations. ied

The systematic and continuous development of the ‘matrix approach’ [2] allowed us to
find some answers to both challenges, and in this paper, we present them as two mutually
related methods for solving problems of discrete fractional calculus on non-uniformly spaced
discretization grids. Moreover, we extend this approach to distributed-order operators and
distributed-order differential equations.

We start with demonstrating how the matrix approach can be extended to numerical
