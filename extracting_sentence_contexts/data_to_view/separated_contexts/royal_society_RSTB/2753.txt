The tapetum is not to be looked upon generally as a morphological constant, not-
withstanding that it shows some constancy of character in certain circles of affinity. It originates from different sources : sometimes it is not differentiated at all, in other
cases it may appear as a more or less definite band of cells, which originates from the
tissues surrounding the sporogenous cell, or group of cells, sometimes from the
sporogenous group itself. f

In Psilotum,{ Tmesipteris,§ and Ophioglossum|| there is no definite tapetum ; it is

true a broad irregular band of tabular cells, surrounding the sporogenous groups,
becomes disorganised, but without assuming the glandular characters usual for a
tapetum, On the other hand, a large number of cells of the sporogenous groups in
these plants act like a diffused tapetum, becoming absorbed during the development
of the spores ; this fact may have its bearing on the absence of a definite tapetal
layer outside. In quisetum, however, both a diffused tapetum of this nature is
found, and a definite single-layered tapetum, which originates outside the sporogenous
group.* The large spores are thus amply provided for.. A tapetum originating
outside the sporogenous group is found in Lycopodium,+ Phylloglossum,t the Marat-
tiaceve,§ and in Helminthostachys|| and Botrychium.
