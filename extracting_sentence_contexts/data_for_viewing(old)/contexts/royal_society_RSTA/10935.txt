series do not differ much in the mean number of bands, but the difference of variability
is very significant. I should take it to be a very fair measure of the relative range
of environment in the two cases. When we turn to the Shirley series the
difference is almost too great for any comparison. While the Hampden series had
some twenty-five capsules, on an average, to the plant, the Chelsea series numbered

only about three! In fact, besides being extremely crowded a process ofâ€™ selection
had gone on in the transit. From examination of the uninjured plants, I think that
five capsules a plant would be more than the average of these poppies before packing,
and that at least one to two capsules per plant were destroyed on the journey. |
Accordingly, I do not consider that much weight should be given to the results of
this series, but I felt bound to include it as I have included all the series dealt |
with, even when I hold them to be really unsuited to the present investigation.
If we consider the two methods of dealing with Series (ii), i.e., that of including

Aall possible pairs, and that of including pairs in which no capsule was repeated, we

Sifind that no very sensible change is made in the mean or variation, but a rather
