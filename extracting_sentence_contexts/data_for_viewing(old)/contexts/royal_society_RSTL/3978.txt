THE term Hrduced contractions was applied in England to a physiological fact
discovered by myself, and described in the tenth chapter of my treatise on the Elec-
tro-physiological Phenomena of Animals. I shall henceforth adopt this denomination,
since it has the advantage of expressing the phenomenon with brevity, and, to a certain
degree, its nature.

I will begin by explaining, in a few words, in what this fact consists, together with
the principal researches which I made in the commencement for the purpose of dis-
covering its laws. Having prepared a galvanoscopic frog, I laid its nerve upon one
or both the thighs of a frog prepared in the ordinary manner ; this done, on applying
the poles of a pile upon the lumbar plexuses of the frog, at the same time that the
maseles of the thighs were contracted, contractions were excited in the galyanoscopic
leg, the nerve of which reposed upon the thigh of the other frog. I discovered the
