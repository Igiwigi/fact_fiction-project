EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF THE STREAM-LINES FOR AN INnviscrip FLurp.

20. The apparatus employed for the experimental determination of the stream-
lines for the perfect fluid was that designed by Mr. E. F. Renr.f It depends upon the
fact that the equations giving the stream-lines in a non-viscous fluid and the equipo-
tential lines in an electric field are identical. The apparatus consists of a concrete tank
5 ft. long, 2 ft. 6 in. wide, and 1 ft. 3 in. deep, filled with water and having thin sheets
of aluminium mounted on the two longer sides. An aluminium model of the aérofoil,
of 3-in. chord, was placed vertically at 10 degrees incidence in the centre of the tank,
the upper end being above water ; a reproduction to scale of the large model in position
in the Duplex tunnel was thus ensured, so that the wall interference should correspond.
An alternating potential difference could be maintained between the two side plates by
means of an oscillatory valve circuit with a frequency of about 200 per sec. In parallel
with the tank was a potentiometer wire, employed for the purpose of defining exactly
the quantitative spacing of the stream-lines. A selected point on the potentiometer
wire and the movable electrode in the tank were connected to a three-valve low-frequency
amplifier. By listening in the head-phones connected to the output side of the amplifier
