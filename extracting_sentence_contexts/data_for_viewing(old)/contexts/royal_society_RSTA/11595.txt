studies showing the bubble opening quite centrally round the emergent column, and
the fact that the base of this does not photograph shows how completely the original
milk drop is collected at the top of the column. Sub-group B illustrates what
happens when, as in Photograph 18, the top of the bubble is struck by the column
and burst at one side. Under the influence of the surface tension, rotundity of form
is soon regained, and by the time the stage of Photograph 21 is reached all traces of
previous irregularities have disappeared.

Examination with a lens of Photographs 3, 4, and 5 shows how the drop, on first
entering, punches a very sheer-walled hole.* From the fact that these early stages
photograph so well as compared (see next series) with corresponding stages when the
drop is of water and the liquid is milk, we infer that the first liquid thrown up is
milk drawn from the fringe of the drop itself. It must be remembered that owing to
the closeness of the camera, front and back parts of the crater cannot be quite in
focus together. The first flow of the liquid appears to be very much along the
surface, afterwards it is much more perpendicular to the surface, and this alone
appears sufficient to account for the sharp curling-over of the edge of the crater
(Photographs 4 to 6); for superposition of the photographs seems to show that in the
early stages each particle continues to move for some distance in the straight line
along which it was first projected from the surface. As to the reason of the closing
in of the crater we shall make some remarks in connection with the next series.
