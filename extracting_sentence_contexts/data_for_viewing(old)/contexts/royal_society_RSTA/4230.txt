model that can be estimated from time-series data of each subject. It is noted that the inclusion
of HR as a third input does not alter the PDMs of the other two inputs obtained by use of the
two-input model. This is additional evidence of the independent influence of HR changes.

An important question that arises from critical contemplation of the proposed approach is
whether the obtained PDMs (being singular vectors derived from SVD of the kernel matrix,
and not statistical estimates) reflect actual physiological entities or they are simply by-products
of the computational method. This valid concern can be addressed through statistical analysis
of the ANF coefficient estimates that are associated functionally with the PDMs, because these
coefficient estimates (obtained via least-squares regression) directly define the contribution of
each PDM to the model prediction. When we performed the traditional analysis of statistical
significance (p-values) on the obtained ANF coefficient estimates, only a subset of these
coefficients were shown to be statistically significant (table 2) despite the fact that nonlinear
models were found to satisfy the BIC as discussed above. This may imply that a larger sample of
subjects and/or longer data records may be required to demonstrate the statistical significance of
some of these coefficient estimates (because the statistical hypothesis testing is a sufficient but not
necessary condition). It may also indicate that the presence of possible system non-stationarities,
which has been investigated recently [26,27], may affect the results of traditional hypothesis
testing (p-values).

Examination of the relative contributions of the three inputs (in terms of their average RMS
values over all subjects) to the prediction of the output reveals that ABP makes the largest
contribution (RMS mean = 1.78) with the ETCO2 second (RMS mean = 1.37) and the HR third
(RMS mean = 0.93). The importance and independence of the contribution of HR changes to
the dynamic changes in CBFV is illustrated in figure 5 for one subject, along with the relative
