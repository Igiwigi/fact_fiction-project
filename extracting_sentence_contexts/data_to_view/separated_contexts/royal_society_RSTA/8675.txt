This figure is about ten times greater than measures of ¢ at a height of a few
hundred meters, deduced by various authors. If the air which forms the top of the
cumulus had really started from a height of 1 km. instead of from the ground, as we
have supposed, then the numerical value of ¢ would have to be divided by four. Reasons have already been given (Part VII.) for supposing that ¢ derived in this
way from cumulus clouds is a measure of frictional effects, but not of the diffusion of
entropy, because the linear term in (Part V., 3) does not vanish on taking the mean,
owing to the fact that the eddies are produced by variations of entropy. To put it in
another way: In G. I.
