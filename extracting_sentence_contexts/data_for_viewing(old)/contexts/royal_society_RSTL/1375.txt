function. It supposes likewise (and which by the way, is not
true), that anatomists are perfectly agreed upon this matter;
and that those who make their appeal to anatomy, have ad-
mitted a common standard of comparison, by which they allow
their experiments to be judged ; but no position is more remote
from fact. It is sufficient tosay, that some think ultimatenervous
fibres are constructed to act by tremors, whilst others believe
them to be hollow tubes. Nor is the difference of opinion less,
respecting the appearances which they exhibit on being viewed
by a microscope. One eminent physiologist* observes, that
the ultimate neryous fibres are © serpentine and convoluted,
« very much resembling the winding of the seminal ducts in
< the testicle, or epididymis:” but having extended his micro-
scopical observations to other parts, he finds a similar disposI-
tion of fibre; nay, even neutral salts, in a state of crystalli-
zation, and metals, when microscopically examined, have
convoluted fibrous appearances, corresponding with those of
nerves. Another ingenious inquirer, + having subjected the
