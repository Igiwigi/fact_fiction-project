This schematic figure is reproduced in
text-fig. 7, p. 55. In this figure contour-lines have been plotted out, marking the
limits of (@) an area of entoderm whose cells are much less heavily yolk-laden than
those of the entoderm round about it ; (b) the area of extension of mesoderm ; and
(c) an area of more or less thickened ectoderm, merging, beyond the limit thus
indicated, in the attenuated layer of flattened cells, characteristic of the “ extra-
embryonic” vesicle-wall,

The entodermal area (a) whose limit is defined in the figure by the contour-line
a.0.p. may thus be identified as defining an “area pellucida,” over against a
surrounding “area opaca.” In the sections these two regions are marked off from
one another with tolerable abruptness, in the same manner as in the succeeding
stage, the “postgastrular,” to be described later. That the differentiation in

question was not more clearly manifest during examination zn toto, is probably due to
the fact that the more or less accidental presence of a layer of yolk-spheres, adherent
to its deep surface, had masked the distinction between the entoderm of the area
pellucida and the surrounding more heavily yolk-laden entoderm.
