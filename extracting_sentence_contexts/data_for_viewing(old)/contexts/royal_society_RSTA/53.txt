body, the notion of external power requires an extension to that of relative power, specified
below. For it, we require the invariance with respect to a class of rigid-body-type changes
in observers, including the reference space.

(6) We can get balance equations from discrete schemes through homogenization procedures
(e.g. [36,37]). A fruitful, challenging portion of this path is the evaluation of the
continuum limit of the Boltzmann equation [23].

The second group of possible paths involves the choice of the list of state variables, so that we put
on the same conceptual level the derivation of the balance equations and the (at least preliminary)
assignment of the constitutive equations.

(7) We can evaluate, in fact, the first variation of some energy, even including dissipation
potentials (in this case, we have expressions of the so-called dâ€™Alembert-Lagrange
principle).

(8) We can impose a balance of energy and require its covariance in the case that bulk forces can
be dissipative.

(9) We can assume an appropriate version of the Poisson brackets, even including dissipative
brackets (they are connected with a dissipation potential).

(10) We can decide a version of the second law of thermodynamics (even including the relative
power) and require its covariance.
