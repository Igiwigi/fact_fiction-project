The Permeability of the Wood to Air. Von Houvet greatly over-estimated the resistance to the flow of air along open
narrow tubes, which plays little or no part in the maintenance of negative tensions
in the vessels. The latter is, in fact, due solely to the relative impermeability of the
moist walls and pit-membranes of the vessels. SrRasBuURGERT confirms Von
HO6xHNeEtâ€™s observation that a stream of air-bubbles escapes through branches of the
Maple and other trees closed at their outer cut surfaces and subjected at their inner
ends under water to a pressure 60 centims. or more of Hg less than an atmosphere. The stream ceases when the difference of pressure is less pronounced and, according
to SrraspurGer, dry wood allows air to pass more readily than wet wood.
