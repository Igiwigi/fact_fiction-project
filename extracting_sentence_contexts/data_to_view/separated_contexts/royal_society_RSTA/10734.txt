It would appear to be much
easier to modify a single character of the skull by selection without altering other
characters than can be the case with other parts of the skeleton. The measurements considered in this paper are: L the greatest length, B the
greatest breadth of the skull, H the height measured from the auricular line, I the
= cephalic index = B/L, and C the capacity. In choosing the material several points
2 had to be borne in mind :
§ (i.) A sufficiently large series must be used.
& Asa matter of fact, 50 to 100 skulls are considered by craniologists to be a fair
© series, but such numbers are small from the mathematician’s standpoint.
‘© (ii.) Material must be drawn from as widely different races as possible, if we are to
“= measure the legitimacy of applying results obtained from one local race to another,
S  (iii.) The capacities must have been determined by competent observers using
S approximately like methods of measurement.
‘= The data which seemed to me to approximately fulfil these conditions are the
2 following :—

5 (a.) A series of Bavarian (Alt-Baierische) skulls measured by Professor J. RANK»,

3 and given in his ‘ Beitriige zur physischen Anthropologie der Bayern.’ In
2 this case there were 100 ¢ and 99 ? with L, B, H, I, and C available.

e (b.) A series of Aino skulls measured by KoGaner, a craniologist trained in
> German schools, and given in the ‘ Mittheilungen aus der Medicinischen
£ Facultiit der Kaiserlich-Japanischen Universitiit, Tokio, Bd. ii., 1894. In
g this case L, B, H, I, and C are given for 76 d and 52 % skulls, and there
& are 11 ¢ and 11 ? skulls for which L, B, H, and I only are given.

3 (c.) A series of Naqada skulls discovered in Egypt by Professor FLinpEeRs Perrin,
8 and measured by Miss C.
