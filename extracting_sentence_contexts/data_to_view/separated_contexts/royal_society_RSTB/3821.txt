Thus it is apparent that the
effect of cutting out the central representation of one group of muscles is to increase
the length of time required for a recovery to a very marked degree. As far as can
be ascertained the two sets of experiments corresponded in all other details, so that
the conclusion is inevitable that it is the fact of causing the one central representation
to do the work of two, instead of causing the two central representations merely to
exchange functions that causes the delay in restoration of function of the muscle
groups affected. This increase of time necessary for recovery is due apparently to
the reduction of volume of the nerve supply, and possibly also to the fact that the
central representation must needs take on a double function, which may involve a
more complex change than a mere alteration of function of the entire centre. (b) Comparison with the Experiments on Nerve Crossing published by Others.â€”
Rawa (2), Srerani (3), and Cunnrycuam (5) have published experiments on nerve
crossing. With those of Rawa and CunniNGHAM no proper comparison can be
instituted, because in the former the crossings were made in the hind-limb, and in
order to prevent confluent reunion, involving a restoration of the normal paths for the
impulses, Rawa had excised widely the central segment of the one nerve and the
peripheral of the other, securing thus a certain pure union between the two other
non-corresponding segments.
