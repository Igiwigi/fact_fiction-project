Dismissing respiration, we may next consider the much more dificult and debatable
question whether these structures can be regarded as in any way subsidiary to the
function of audition,

Our knowledge of the pliysiology of hearing is mainly confined to the higher air-
breathing Vertebrata, and ljut comparatively little is experimentally ov certainly
kuown at present about this function in Pishes. The conditions of subsaqieous
audition are in several respects very different trom those in air, Nob only do sound
Vibrations in water travel with more than quadruple the rapidity with which they are
transmitted in an, but they cun be appreciated at far greater distances. ‘There is, in
fact, u closer analogy between water and solid bodies than belween water and air, so
far we the transmission of sound vibrations is concerned. ‘These facts may, Lo some
extent perhaps, be physiologically imstrated by the statement Ulut the relations of
the Miditory organ of a Fish to w sounding body in water are not very dissimilar to
