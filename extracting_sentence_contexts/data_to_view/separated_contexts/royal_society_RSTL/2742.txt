We now see that this is merely an accidental result of the true rule. 27. The different epoch of the diurnal inequality in different parts of the world is a
very curious fact ; and the more 80, 8ince it is inconsistent with the mode hitherto
adopted of explaining the cireumstances of the tides by conceiving a tide-wave to
travel to all shores in succession. In accordance with this view the tide on the
$hores of America had been considered as identical with the tide on the coasts of
Spain and Portugal, which occurs about the same moment ; nor does it appear easy
to imagine the form of the tide-waves $0 that this shall not be the case. Yet we find
that the tides on these two sides of the Atlantic cannot be identical in all respects ;
for on the 9th, 10th, and 11th of June, when the diurnal inequality was great in
America, it was nothing in the West of Europe; and on the 18th and 19th, when this
inequality had vanished in America, it was great in Europe, It would seem as if the
tidal phenomena on this side of the Atlantic corresponded to an epoch (of the equi-
librium-theory) two or three days later than the same phenomena in America ; and
we may perhaps add, that different kinds of phenomena do not appear to travel at
the same rate, And thus the equilibrium-theory, though it may explain the general
form of the inequalities, cannot give their epochs and amounts by any possible ad-
justment of constants.
