Assuming a given probability distribution of the fibre strength it is possible to
analyse properties of studied material and its behaviour under loading using advanced methods
of statistical physics. Among other things one can evaluate the failure strength, critical properties
of the dynamics for different types of fibre strength distributions and analyse in detail the fracture
and failure dynamics. From our point of view, the most important fact is that the FBM method is also based on the
discrete representation of the medium by a set (bundle) of fibres. Additionally, when comparing
the FBM method to the DEM particles interaction model used, one can easily recognize that the
FBM fibres are almost direct counterparts of the bonds joining the DEM particles. Almost directly,
because the fibres in FBM and the bonds in DEM have a stochastic distribution of their strength
and both can be regarded as ‘springs’ with given, constant in time ‘spring constant’ but they
are differently arranged.
