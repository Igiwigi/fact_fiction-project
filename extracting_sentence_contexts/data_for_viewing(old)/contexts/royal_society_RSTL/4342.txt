49. So far as the structure of the inner and outer membranes is concerned, the
testis resembles the ovary. But the spermatozoa are contained in ovoid or pyriform,
thick-walled sacs, about &;th of an inch in long diameter placed between the two, fig.31.
In one individual the sperm-sacs were more ovoid in shape, and did not appear to have
any particular attachment to either membrane, but in the rest they were all connected
with the inner membrane, and when its inner surface was turned towards the eye, the

* It appears to me that M. Miuxz-Evwanns must have had a young individual of Rhizostoma before him,
when he says (Obseryations sur la Structure de la M6duse Marsupiale), © Nor does the plaited membrane, which
forms a eort of partition between the central and the four lateral cavities, appear to be an organ of reprodue-
tion. If we examine one of these membranes superficially with the naked eye, we see towards its upper part a
kind of woollen fringe, which at first sight might be taken for a series of glandular sacs, but bythe aid of the
microzcope it is found that this appearance is due in fact to a multitude of suckers (ﬆupoirs), having the greatest
similarity in form to those appendages which are observable in certain parts of the body of different Zoophytes,
8uch as Vitella, Actinia, &&. From this it would appear that these membranes are much more fitted for
absorption or respiration, as is the opinion of M. Eyszxnanvr, than for the formation of ova.”

openings of the sacs could be perceived : the sacs were filled with spermatozoa with
triangular heads, about 33th of an inch in diameter, and very long, fine, delicate
tails, fig. 31a. The course of their development appeared to be as in Phacello-
