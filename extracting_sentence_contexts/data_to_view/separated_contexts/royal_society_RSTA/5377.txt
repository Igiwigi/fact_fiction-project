It is a rule of thumb that time delays typically cause instability in dynamical
systems. This phenomenon is a primary source of oscillatory behaviour in
delayed systems. What makes time delay effects even more critical is the fact
that the induced oscillatory behaviour typically involves complex combinations
of unstable periodic motions. In mathematical terms, the destabilizing effect of
time delays usually lead to subcritical Hopf bifurcations, where unstable periodic
orbits are born. Not surprisingly, these complex dynamical systems often exhibit
chaotic or transient chaotic behaviour locked in the jungle of unstable periodic
motions permanently or temporarily (see introductions by Guckenhiemer &
Holmes (1990) or Thompson & Stewart (2002), and the review of corresponding
delayed mathematical models by Campbell (2007)).
