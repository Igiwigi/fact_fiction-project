from which I suspected an unfavourable result, I am not in
possession of a single fact which is not perfectly consistent
with the theory I have adyanced,

There is, however, one circumstance stated by HALEs and

emitted, in the night, from pores situated on their edges ; and. on evaporating this
liquid obtained from very luxuriant plants of the yine I found a very large residuum
to remain, which was similar in external appearance to carbonate of lime. It must,
however, have been evidently a very different substance from the very large portion,
which the water held in solution. I do not know that this substance has been ana-
