revascularization (figure 9). The panels illustrated in this figure demonstrate that the maximum
velocities in all the considered areas of the left coronary artery (In, Out1, Out2) are associated with

the diastolic part of the cardiac cycle, that is, after the closure of the aortic valve. On the contrary,

the minimum velocities occur at the beginning of the left ventricular systole, ie. immediately after
excitation of the myocardium. Such a restriction for blood flow is directly related to mechanical
compression of the distal parts of the coronary arteries located in the thickness of the heart wall

and is directly related to the contractile function of the myocardium.

Figure 9b also shows a retrograde blood flow in all arterial branches after stenting at the
very beginning of the left ventricular systole. This fact coincides in time with the isovolumic
contraction phase of the left ventricle, when the heart chamber volume does not change (all
valves are closed). At the same time, an increase in mechanical stress in the myocardium and
the associated increase in intramyocardial pressure in the heart wall create excessive pressure in
blood vessels. This phenomenon is commonly known as the ‘intravascular or intramyocardial
pump’, which is first discussed by Spaan [47] and discussed in detail in a review paper [48].

It is generally accepted that the intramyocardial pump makes a positive contribution to the
myocardium blood supply and is mainly realized in the distal parts of the coronary vessels,
moving blood towards the capillary stream bed. In large arteries, located mainly on the outer
surface (epicardium) of the left ventricle, this phenomenon is not pronounced and manifests itself
in a retrograde blood flow. The degree of such a flow largely depends on the anatomical features
of the coronary network, i.e. how deeply the branched arteries are immersed into the wall of the
