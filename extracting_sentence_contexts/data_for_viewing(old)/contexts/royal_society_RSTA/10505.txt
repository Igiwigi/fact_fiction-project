: blank spaces of the solar spectrum where the lines are weaker than 0, and only a few
of the very weakest lines in the table coincide with solar lines with an intensity less
than 2.

As a corollary to this, it may be stated that in general the greater the intensity of
a dark line in the solar spectrum, the more probable is its presence as a bright line in
any given image of the flash, and in the long range of spectrum covered by the
spectra under discussion, \ 3500 to A 5000, the dark lines of intensities exceeding 7
are all present as bright lines, except in two or three instances where they are
obviously obscured by strong hydrogen or calcium lines.

In the tables of flash-spectrum lines published by Frost and by Mrrcuett, the
same general fact is apparent in the large number of identifications made with
prominent Fraunhofer lines. Professor Frost concludes that ‘‘at least 60 per cent.
(and probably many more) of the stronger dark lines of the solar spectrum are found
bright in a stratum not exceeding 1” in height above the photosphere.”*

It will probably be generally admitted, therefore, that the flash spectrum as
photographed hitherto is a reversal of the more prominent of the Fraunhofer lines,
