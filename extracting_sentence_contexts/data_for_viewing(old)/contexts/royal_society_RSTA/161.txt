Taxonomy as an eScience 955

versions are rare (since they become outdated as soon as, or before, they are
printed), accessibility is often restricted to those with access to comprehensive
libraries and new information gets published mostly as one-off papers
independent of the consolidated monograph. Ink-on-paper survives, however,
because its permanence renders it an attractive medium to a discipline as
dependent on legacy literature as taxonomy. The legacy archive in taxonomy is
crucial for it allows taxonomists and others to locate not simply factual
information about a species, but also the taxonomic sense (concept) applied to
that species by an author—that is, how did the author delimit the species in
terms, say, of the specimens examined, its distribution and the set of characters
on which it was defined? Botanists use the word ‘protologue’ for the publishec
outcome of this holistic exercise.

The limitations of ink-on-paper combined with the existence of the Interne
means that Web-based taxonomy has become inevitable. The need for
access to biodiversity information in collections of natural history specimens
and natural history libraries (particularly their inherent time dimension
provides the major driver to digitize the content in individual institutions anc
in networking the resultant distributed databases. Already large quantities
