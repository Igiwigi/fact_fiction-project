This proves equation (34).

That the present theory (and Maxwett’s), so far as H and A depend upon I and C,
thus leads exactly to the ordinary theory is of some importance. One consequence is,
that the mechanical action between bodies carrying currents and the induction of
currents by the variation of position and magnitude of other currents and magnets,
must necessarily be independent of the nature of the medium separating them, so long
as that medium is non-magnetic. This is in direct contrast with the known large
influence the medium separating two charges of electricity has on the mutual actions
of the bodies bearing the charges. On the present, as on MAXWELU's theory, this is
simply owing to the fact that the ordinary theory of magnetism is in the puints just
mentioned, accurately true, whereas the ordinary theory (action-at-a-distance, with
consequently no difference of specific inductive capacity for different media) of
electrostatics is not even approximately true. [Whether or not the theory I have
called the “ordinary” theory has actually ever been formulated is of little conse-
quence. I haye, in the above, accurately enough described what I mean by the
term. |
