Murray for having thus afforded me
Â£ the opportunity of studying the zooids of Millepora in the expanded condition, and I
SZ do not think that I should ever have succeeded in arriving at a satisfactory knowledge
S of their structure without this aid. Mr. Murray further, who had had better oppor-

S central zooid of each system had a mouth. No species of Millepora appears hitherto
to have been known to occur on the reefs of the Society Islands. In DaxAa's work on
Corals* no Millepora is mentioned as occurring at Tahiti, and this locality is not given
