and if 80, may we not learn something
from this of the recent outburst of the star in Corona ?”

Before the paper was written I had diligently swept round the solar disk in search of
evidence of the red flames, but without result. This want of success I attributed to the
excessive brilliancy of the spectrum of the circumsolar regions in the field of view of the
instrument employed. I found in fact (although I did not discontinue my efforts) that
both for these observations and for those on sun-spots more dispersion Was Necesary ; in
one case to weaken the atmospheric light, in the other to widen the spectrum. I therefore represented my requirements to the Government-Grant Committee, and
was at once 8upplied with funds to procure a spectroscope of the requisite dispersive
power. The construction of this instrument was commenced in the beginning of 1867 by
Mr. Cooks, on a plan which had been arranged between us, but unfortunately it was
never finighed.
