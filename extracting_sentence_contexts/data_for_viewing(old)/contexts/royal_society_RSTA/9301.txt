a Thus, when the molecular masses are very unequal, the range in the value of D,,
"3 should be very great. No such large variation is found to exist, however, according
= to the results of experiment.

‘2 Meyer's theory took no account of the tendency of a molecule to persist in motion
cs along its original direction after collision: as JEANS has shown in connection with
& viscosity, however, “ persistence of velocities” is a very important fact, the neglect of
% which leads to grave error in the mean-free-path theory. Kurnen || has shown that
= when taken account of in the theory of diffusion, it largely removes the discrepancy
—& between the small observed variations of D,,, and the variations theoretically
* calculated by the method referred to.

3 An earlier modification of Mryer’s theory by Gross! may also be mentioned. This
° predicts variations of amount similar to those observed, but generally of the wrong
5 sign ; its merits are not such as to demand more than this brief historical reference.
