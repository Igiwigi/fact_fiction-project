On the Veined Structure of Glacier 1ce.

= This structure has been indifferently called the © veined structure,” the © banded
Sructure,” the © ribboned structure,” and the * laminar structure” of glacier ice. In a
gpmmunication to the Geological Society of France assembled at Porrentruy in September
F838, M. Guyor gave the following interesting description of the phenomenon :—* Since
Ho word layer has escaped me, I cannot help recording as a subject of investigation for
ture observers a fact, regarding which I dare not hazard an explanation ; especially as
-Þ have not encountered it more than once. It was at the summit of the Gries, at a
RSeight of about 7500 feet, a little below the line of the first or high nev6, where the
ED passes into a state of granular mow. . . . . In ascending to the origin of this latter
Fthe glacier of Bettelmatten), for the purpose of examining the formation and direction
ER the great transverse fissures, I 8aw under my feet the surface of the glacier entirely
Zovered with regular furrows, from 1 to 2 inches in width, hollowed in a half snowy
Mass, and separated by protruding plates of an ice more hard and transparent.
