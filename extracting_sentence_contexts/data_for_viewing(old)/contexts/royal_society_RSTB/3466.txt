Africa.{ On the north and north-east it is bounded by the southern extension of the
Guinea region and on the east by the woodland formation§ of the mountainous
districts of inner Damaraland. It has been shown§ that, in spite of the remarkable
development of endemic and peculiar forms in the desert strip, there are, nevertheless,
indications that its flora is allied to that of the Acacia region, which itself is probably
connected with that of Guinea through Ovamboland and the lower and intermediate
slopes of the Angola Plateau. The geographical evidence is therefore not opposed
to the view that the floras to which the African Gneta and Welwitschia respectively
belong are descended from the same phytogeographical stock. At the same time, the
physical geography of the coastal area of Damaraland,|| together with the unique
characters of the dominant elements of its flora, indicate that the conditions which
have led to its differentiation have persisted through an enormously long period.
The fact that Welwitschia diverges so widely in its external characters, as probably
also in the details of its reproduction, from species which, for geographical reasons,
may be supposed to be more nearly related to it than any other living plants, is
therefore not remarkable. If forms intermediate between Gnetwm Gnemon and
Welwitschia still exist, they are to be looked for in G. Bucholzianum and
G. Africanum, or in other species occurring in the same phytogeographical region,
and at present undiscovered.

[It is due to the author to state that, during the last few months, he has been
conducting a Sladen Botanical expedition in different parts of Africa, and has therefore
had no opportunity of noticing the most recent literature bearing on the subject of
this paper.—A. C. 8.]
