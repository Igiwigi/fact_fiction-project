In the dissection of the sound heart of the adult, depicted in the drawing No. 2,
entitled © The ganglia and nerves at the apex of the left ventricle of the sound
human heart,” the additional neryes at the apex of the left ventricle are more clearly

nying the apicial branch of the posterior coronary artery: there is also a well-marked
angular enlargement at the point of junction of four nerves near a neighbouring
