Of these 14:94 parts of total dry increase, 13:2 were fat, 1:62
| 'nitrogenous compounds, and 0:11 mineral matter. Against these numbers we have.
aking the average of all the other estimates (twenty-four in number, and comprising
80 animals), 17-27 total dry increase for 100 of dry food ; of which 15:81 are exti-
mated as fat, 1-44 nitrogenous substance, and an insignificant amount of mineral matter. It is admitted that the estimates in Table XIV. relating to the Sheep, show a higher
proportion of mineral to other constituents, stored up, than was probably the fact. On
the other hand, the estimates of assimilated mineral matter in the case of the Pigs are
probably in error in the other direction. It is true, that Pigs, though young, if put upon
Shighly fattening food will grow comparatively little in frame, whilst Sheep, fed as they
anow generally are at a comparatively early age, will develop more of hard bony struc-
Sture.
