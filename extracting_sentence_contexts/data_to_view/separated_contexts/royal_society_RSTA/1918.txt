Dark minerals were abundant and were originally
represented by hornblende which was quite allotriomorphic, not idiomorphic as in the
basic granite. The hornblende is now entirely replaced by chlorite in the specimens
examined. In fact the minerals in the “heathen” always present the appearance of
being more “ weathered” than the corresponding minerals in the matrix. The plagio-
clase is, curiously enough, represented by albite or albite-oligoclase clouded by
secondary products and possibly itself being of secondary origin. Along the junction
with the normal granite large orthoclase crystals may extend from the matrix into
the “heathen,” and then become packed with small inclusions of plagioclase and of
ragged chlorite after hornblende.
