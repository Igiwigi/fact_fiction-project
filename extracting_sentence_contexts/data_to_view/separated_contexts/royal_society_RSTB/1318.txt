eric young are produced by megalospheric parents, while it is no less certain that
Fijian specimens, as described by Brady, and in Tongan specimens, as I have

the two forms to one another will be discussed at the end of this paper. *

lt may be pointed out here that, in the Tongan specimens, the nuclear characters

the two forms agree fairly well with those of Polystomella.
