1. Specific heat and heat produced by mixing ; for by dividing the number of units
of heat evolved by 5 grms. of any mixture by 3411, the elevation of the specific
heat of 8nch mixture above the theoretical specific heat is obtained.

2. Boiling-point and capillary attraction, which in a similar way can be calculated
from each other.

Deviize and Hogx have shown the specific gravity and index of refraction to be con-

nected with each other.

Whether these relations hold good with other similar substances, whether in fact
these experiments have brought forward one example of a general law, or only disco-
vered a singular anomaly, must be left for further research to decide.

Curve 1 gives the specific heats; the vertical lines represent the percentage by weight of
alcohol in this and all the following curves.
The horizontal line gives the specific heat, water=100.
