Bleeding of the uterine wall, I find to be
extremely slight; but it is in the majority of cases, as I shall subsequently show,
present to some degree. External bleeding during procestrum takes place with many
of the domestic animals, and its occasional occurrence â€˜in the sheep has been noted
by Wixtsaire (1883) and other authors. The flow of mucus from the vaginal
opening, although primarily a characteristic of procestrum, may continue during
cestrus, or even for a very short time during metcestrum.}

This is due to the extreme shortness of the processes of procestrum and cestrus in
many domestic sheep, the mucus not having had time to escape, although the

* The longer duration of the cestrus periods of Scotch Black-faced sheep under more extreme conditions
(e.g. of climate and altitude) may be taken as evidence that in the perfectly wild state on the high
mountain, sheep have a still more prolonged cestrus which does not recur.

+ A sheep breeder tells me that in Dorset Horn ewes in the south of England the cestrus may recur as
often as every eleven days, each cestrus lasting for only about two hours.

} That cestrus does not generally commence with bitches until external bleeding is over is a fact well
known to dog breeders. But a slight flow of mucus, accompanied by a little blood and a swollen vulva,
may continue for some days during cestrus, or even after. Such, at least, was the case with a Dandie
Dinmont terrier, in the possession of the present writer, for nearly a week after the performance of
artificial insemination.
