However,
the Couette loss was as high as that encountered in a length of pipe equal to 100 diameters. See figure 15, where n denotes the length of a pipe, in terms ofits diameter, which would have
caused the same pressure loss as that lost at the inlet of the pipe at the same value of v/D. For
ordinary liquids n is of the order of unity. The second abnormality arises from the fact that inside the pipe ordinary liquids flow in
concentric laminae of increasing rates of shear. These liquids, on the present theories, would
tend to migrate across the stream tubes. As the migration is a function of Ã©?~*, approximately,
with c<1 the abnormal effects will show more in the outer layers than in the inner layers.
