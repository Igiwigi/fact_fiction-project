5. Far-non-equilibrium rate-controlled constrained-equilibrium extension
of Onsager reciprocity

As shown in [74,107] in the QT framework, for states belonging to a constrained maximal entropy
manifold, such as within the RCCE approximation, any SEA evolution equation (i.e. regardless of
the particular form of the dissipative metric operator G,) entails a natural extension of Onsager’s


reciprocity theorem beyond the near-equilibrium realm. In fact, when equation (2.6) holds for
the functional derivative of the entropy, equations (4.2) and (4.3) become, in terms of the ‘non-
equilibrium constraint potentials’ x; and the ‘projected functional derivatives of the constraints’,

The natural properties of symmetry and positive definiteness of the non-degenerate metric Gy
grant automatically (no additional assumptions needed) its invertibility (Gy 1) and the symmetry
and non-negative definiteness of matrix Lx. In both cases, we have

where we emphasize that the relations between rates /7,, and affinities x, are nonlinear because
the Lj,’s depend on y which in turn (in the RCCE approximation) are nonlinear functions of the
Xx’s. For a number of references and important comments on the history of internal variables
(here, the y’s) and variational formulations of non-equilibrium thermodynamics that lead to the
quasi-linear structure of equations (5.6) and (5.7), see [101].
