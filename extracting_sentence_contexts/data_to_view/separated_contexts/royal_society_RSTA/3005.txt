The viewpoint of the SA thus makes a straightforward discussion of correlations (such as
entanglement) in systems of identical particles problematic, because of the difficulty in formally
separating the real part of correlations from the unphysical one arising from labels. Moreover,
such a description hinders the use of a partial trace and the von Neumann entropy, as normally
done for non-identical particles [16]. In fact, indistinguishability implies that the particles are
not individually addressable and so the common reduced density matrix obtained by the partial
trace is meaningless. This issue has originated different treatments for a faithful quantification of
identical particle entanglement [16-33].


3. Non-standard approach to many identical particles

Here, we consider a recently introduced approach to deal with identical particles that does not
adopt unphysical labels to mark them [32].
