water leaying no time for the small vent to exert any decisive influence upon the
results,

It should be stated that the disintegration of the shells by 1 ounce, and even 4 ounce
of gun-cotton, through the agency of water (as shown in Table LIL), is far too complete
to be of practical value, as the large number of very small fragments produced would
be of no use as missiles. The fragments furnished by employing only 0-25 ounce of
gun-cotton in the particular sizes of shells used were of much more serviceable nature.
Even with this very small charge the shells were not merely burst into very numerous
fragments, but these were also projected with considerable force.

The powerful effects obtained in those shell-experiments in which gun-cotton was
employed, and the fact that detonation was transmitted from one mass of compressed
gun-cotton to another through small water-spaces under the conditions described at.
page 372, led me to attempt the transmission of detonation from one mass of gun-
cotton or dynamite to another in a tube, with the intervention of water. The tubes
(of wrought iron, 1:25 and 1 inch in diameter) were fixed in a yertical position ; the
lower extremities were closed with plugs of wood and of clay, and in some instances
with strong metal screw-caps; the gun-cotton or dynamite was placed at this extremity,
and the initiative charge, consisting of 2 ounces of compressed gun-cotton or of dyna-

mite, enclosed in waterproof material, was just immersed in the water at the upper
extremity and was detonated in that position. The distance between the two charges
of explosive material was reduced to 2 feet without detonation being transmitted ; and
it was evident that, under the conditions fulfilled by these experiments, the intervening
