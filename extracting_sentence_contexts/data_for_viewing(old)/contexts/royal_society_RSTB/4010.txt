Besides the cases referred to above of artificially produced changes in inheritance,
there are one or two cases in which no causes are known to explain the observed
alterations.

Kextoe (46) described what he called “individual idiosyncrasy” in the behaviour
of certain silk-worms when crossed with one another.

In one experiment, Italian silk-worms (with salmon cocoon) ? X Bagdad (white
cocoon) ¢ gave F, all with salmon cocoons.

In another experiment all the F, individuals formed white cocoons. This may be
compared with the fact that in 1912 most of the experiments showed a dominance of
E. esculentus ov E. acutus characters over E. miliaris; in a few cases the inheritance
was otherwise.

ArnoLp LANG (51) crossed the closely related species of snails Zuchea hortensis
and T. nemoralis. Sometimes he got hybrids which followed the usual Mendelian

laws, at other times all the offspring were maternal, When more distinctly related
species, such as 7. hortensis and 7. austriaca, or T. nemoralis and T. austriaca, were
hybridized, only maternal offspring resulted. Lane suggests that when purely
