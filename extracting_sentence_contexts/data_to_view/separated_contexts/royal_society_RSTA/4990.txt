Many additional observations on the experimental implications of the solutions in discrete lattices
are contained in [21]. In all these analytical solutions, the central quantity obtained from the analytical methods is a
relationship between the external load applied to make a crack move and the speed v at which
the crack travels. In fact, the speed v of the crack enters the theory as an input parameter, and
the calculations give the load as an output. For subsonic cracks, one can equivalently say that one
obtains Kj(v), the stress intensity factor as a function of crack speed. For supersonic cracks, the
end result is the external system strain ey, as a function of crack speed [14].
