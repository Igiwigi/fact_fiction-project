8, 9, Plate 34). That union is not due primarily to the expansion of the plates was finally proved by
the experiments described in Part III, in which the ventro-lateral body wall containing
the sternal plates was grown in vitro with the result that the plates moved to the mid-line
and fused. Displacement of each plate as a whole was demonstrated by the fact that
the distance between the outer (costal) margins diminished as well as that between the
ventral margins; had union occurred by expansion alone, the latter distance only
would have lessened. (2) The elongation of the ribs. The ribs fuse with the sternal plates fairly early in
development, and their growth keeps pace with the downward movement of the plates.
