each zone probably does not exceed +100 fathoms. This would give an uncertainty in the
calculated value of gravity of +5 mgals. To account for the whole of the observed scatter,
we should have to assume a mean error of +15 mgals at each deep-sea station. Even
allowing +-5 mgals due to uncertainty in the Eétvés correction, +5 mgals for errors in the —
isostatic anomalies and an error of +3 mgals in the gravity measurement, we get an overall
mean error of only +7-5 mgals. It appears, therefore, that most of the observed scatter is —
really due to variations in gravity. 4

The results of pendulum observations in Devonshire and Cornwall show that changes of ‘
the order of 10 mgals may often occur over distances of a few tens of miles. This is confirmed —
by gravimeter observations in south-west England. The scatter in the submarine measure- —
ments in the shallow parts of the area therefore seems quite normal. The fact that almost
twice as great a scatter should be found over the oceanic part is surprising, particularly
when it is remembered that these observations are made at a height of some 5 km. above the
sea bed. One must conclude that the earth’s crust under this part of the Atlantic Ocean is
even less homogeneous than below the mouth of the English Channel.

These changes in gravity occur within distances which are certainly not greater than
100 km. and probably considerably less. Their cause must therefore be near the upper
surface of the crust. Assuming that the inhomogeneity arises from a complex structure in
which rocks of different density are present, an idea of the order of magnitude can be
obtained from the fact that two semi-infinite horizontal layers of rock 3 km. thick separated
by a vertical interface and differing in density by 0-2, would give a gravitational field at a
level 5 km. above their upper surface, having a maximum gradient of 1 mgal/km. directly
