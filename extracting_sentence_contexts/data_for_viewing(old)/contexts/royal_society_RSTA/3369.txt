phenol is transformed into benzene. Two oxides widely used in these processes are titania and
zirconia. Although the oxide catalysts (ZrO2, TiO2, etc.) work also without any pre-treatment,

there is evidence that a pre-treatment in hydrogen, with the reduction of the oxide, increases the : =
catalytic activity. : S

The scope of this work is to rationalize the experimental observation of a larger activity of : 2
reducible compared to non-reducible oxides, and to identify the active sites that are generated in : &
the course of the pre-treatment in hydrogen of the solid catalyst. To this end, we have performed : _
extensive density functional theory calculations using the DFT + U approach to take into account :W
the semiconductor /insulator nature of the oxides under investigation, TiO2 and ZrO; we also : =
included dispersion forces that are essential when organic molecules interact with a solid surface. : 3
Starting from the fact that the actual catalyst, at least at the laboratory scale, consists of Ru : &

nanoparticles deposited on titania or zirconia, we have considered models of Ru aggregates
supported on the (101) surfaces of anatase TiO2 and tetragonal ZrO.

The first step consisted in the study of the two key processes in the upgrade of bio-oil:
ketonization and DDO. In both cases, the behaviour of stoichiometric a-TiO and t-ZrO2 surfaces
has been compared with that of the corresponding reduced counterparts, a-TiO2_, and t-ZrO2_.
Ketonization of acetic acid has been considered on the surface of ZrO, while deoxygenation
of phenol has been studied on Ru/TiQ). In both cases, we found evidence that the presence of
Zr>+ or Ti+ ions or of oxygen vacancies leads to lower reaction barriers or the stabilization of
intermediates that have little or no stability on the stoichiometric surfaces.
