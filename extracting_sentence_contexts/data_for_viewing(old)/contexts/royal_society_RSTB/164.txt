—namely, by the rheotome method. The presence of the induction shock during the
first three hundredths of a second is, however, a serious difficulty in the prosecution of
such rheotome experiments. It is, however, quite easy to determine the relative
values of the effect as disclosed by closures of from ‘03” to ‘05’ and from -05” to ‘07” ;
and it appears that the effect is always visible during these periods, but, though quite
appreciable, it is not so strong as the nerve-organ response would be at the periods in
question, especially when we take into consideration the magnitude of the total effect.
Thus the largest nerve-organ response was imperceptible with the galvanometer
(zd shunt) after an interval of one second. In the experiment to be next given the
after-effect was so large that after an interval of one minute it was perceptible with
the galvanometer 7} shunt. There should, therefore, be a very large effect if the
galvanometer circuit be closed for from -03”—05” after the excitation. As a matter
of fact, the effect is small under these conditions.
