§ 27. It is instructive to show the identity of Lesescun’s geometrical definition
with that of § 24 (S being a finite segment) directly. At the same time it should be
remarked that the argument is independent of the fact that 8 is a finite segment, so
that we have some general theorems with respect to the geometrical representation of
the processes of integration with respect to a set of points to which I shall return
in § 32,

Lemma 1.—If at every point of a measurable set G on the x-axis of content I we
place an ordinate of length p, the plane set constituted by this set of ordinates, or,
as I shall call them, for definiteness, this set of blocks, is measurable and has
content pl. For we can enclose G in a set of non-overlapping intervals of content less than
I+e. Erecting on these rectangles of height p+e, we have enclosed the whole plane
set in a set of rectangles of content as near as we please to pl.
