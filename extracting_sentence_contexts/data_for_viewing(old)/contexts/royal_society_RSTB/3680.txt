with the exception, perhaps more seeming than real, of Ophioteresis (see p. 57), by
possessing a completely closed radial canal (text-fig. 28, 7.c.). This canal is situated
well above the middle of the vertebra, and in its neighbourhood the main articular
processes are grouped. There can be little doubt that it lodged the radial nerve-cord
and water vessel. Its presence was first noticed by Meek and Worruen, but has
recently been denied by Scu√©nporr. A second and spacious canal (m.c.c., figs. 1A
and 28) also traverses each vertebra in a vertical direction in the median line,
opening by a wide aperture on the dorsal surface and apparently ending blindly just
above the level of the radial canal. Probably it lodged diverticula of the ccelom, the
encroachment of the vertebra upon the ccelom being thus somewhat less complete
than in modern forms. The length of the vertebra is considerably less in its ventral
or lower region than in the neighbourhood of the main articular processes, and this
fact, together with the nature of the joint, accounts for the power possessed by the
arms of Onychaster of rolling in a vertical plane towards the mouth.

The distinction into a thicker middle portion or body involved in the articulation,
and wings which serve as surfaces for the attachment of muscles, is not so sharply
marked as in modern forms. A low ridge or wing extends freely at the sides and on
to the dorsal surface of the vertebra. In its more ventral region the wing is a simple
ridge, more dorsally it is divided longitudinally by a groove (Plate 8, fig. 2). A pair
of great grooves running vertically excavates the body below the level of the main
articular processes, and lies to the inner side of the articular ridges which we shall
describe presently. It is probable that both the wings and the grooves served as
surfaces for the attachment of muscles, which we may perhaps call respectively
upper and lower intervertebral muscles.
