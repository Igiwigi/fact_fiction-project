| the 8m from those not traced; and to this end I requested my assistant, Mr. R. J.
b Friswerl, to prepare two lists showing broadly the chief chemical characteristics of the

þ elements traced and not traced, This was done by taking a number of the best known
' compounds of each element (such, for instance, as those formed with oxygen, sulphur,
chlorine, bromine, or hydrogen), stating after each whether the compounds in question
© were unstable or stable. Where any compound was known not to exist, that fact was
© indicated.

E Two Tables were thus prepared, one containing the solar, the other the more important
S non-80lar elements (according to our knowledge at the time).

5 These Tables gave me, as the differentiation s0ught, the fact that in the main the
j= known 8olar elements formed stable oxygen-compounds.

&b T have said in the main, because the differentiation was not absolute ; but it was sut-

'Z ficientlystrong to make me commence operations by searching for the outstanding strong

E The result up to the present time has been that srontium, cadmium, lead, copper,
© cerium, and uranium®, in addition to those elements in THALfx's last list, would seem
S with considerable probability to exist in the solar reversing layer. Should the presence
Ss of cerium anduranium be subsequently confirmed, most of the iron group of metals will
