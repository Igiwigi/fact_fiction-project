difference of temperature between the calorimeter and the surrounding walls, and I
therefore omit the details of the determination of their fixed points, &c., although I
must add some other facts which are of importance for the present purpose.

The bridge-wire scale was so fixed that the mark 60 centims.* fell exactly in the
middle. Had the bridge-wire been uniform therefore, and had the coefficients of the
two thermometers been always the same, then when both were at the same tempera-
ture the bridge-wire reading would necessarily have been always 60 centims. I
have stated that the thermometer resistances might be regarded as practically equal
when both were in ice. The bridge-wire reading, however, was found to be 598째35
Gillims., when AB and CD were both in ice. At first sight this appeared to indicate
