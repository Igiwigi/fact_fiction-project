From (46) we see that the electric force varies inversely as the square of the
distance for any given direction, but that for any given distance it gradually increases
as 0 increases from 0 to }a. As the speed increases the electric force tends to become
more and more concentrated about the plane through the origin at right angles to the
axis of x, When u = , there is no electric force except in that plane ; we have, in
fact, a plane electric wave moving forward at the speed of light.

The expression for H shows that at low speeds, where 1/v® may be neglected in
& comparison with unity, the magnetic force is the same as that attributed.by AmpiRn’s
8 formula to a current element of “moment” ug. By the moment of an element is
§ meant the product of its length by the strength of the current in it. When the
8 speed of light is attained, the magnetic force is confined to the plane yz, and the lines
of force are circles in that plane with their common centre at the origin.

Mr. Heavisipe has stated* the result when w is greater than v, but has not up to
= the present (March 14, 1896) divulged the manner in which he has obtained the
2 solution in this case. I confine this paper to the case in which ~ is not greater than v.
As the charge moves along, the electric displacement at each point varies, giving
