Another emerging field wherein pharmaceuticals and their derivatives
such as metabolites and degradation products are quantified using MS is environmental science,
especially water analysis. Furthermore, MS is also used in pharmacokinetic studies, drug
discovery, biopharmacy and radiopharmacy [132,158,159]. In fact, in more than 95% of all
cases quantitation of pharmaceutical products is done using MS when complex matrices hinder
a reliable spectrophotometric quantification. For this reason, the use of MS for quantitative
pharmaceutical analysis is a well discussed subject in the literature. Electronic supplementary
material, table S2 provides a general overview of recently published review articles in which
different topics are discussed.
