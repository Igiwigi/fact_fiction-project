Vide the © De Eliminatione,” section. 5., | The investigation of the
arithmetical connexion between the Q of this note and the fundamental Co-bezoutiants must be als0 similarly
reserved. [I believe it to be generally true, and have verified the fact for the case of two cubic functions, that
F.Q gives a quadratic form zuch that the corresponding matrix is the inverse to the matrix' of Q. '/The calon-
lations necessary for extending the'verification/ of this 'remarkable proposition for functions /of \2;,/y exceeding
the third degree (notwithstanding that they are much abbreviated by the application of the rules of the cal-

culus) till remain exceively laborious. The abbreviation alluded to consists in confining tlie verification in

question to the comparison of either 'one of the two unreiterated terms at opposite 'corners 'of the matrix to

E.Q with the corresponding' term in the inverse matrix of Q;"if these| coincide, It is easy to prove that every

other pair of correspondiig terms/in the two matrices must also coincide respectiyely with one another,
