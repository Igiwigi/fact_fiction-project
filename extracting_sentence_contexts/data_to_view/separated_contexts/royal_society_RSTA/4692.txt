Distorting the original city in (a) on a computer by software, e.g. PHorosHop, leads to an apparently
inhomogeneous and anisotropic distribution of car velocities in (6). The trick of transformation optics is to turn this fictitious
velocity distribution into a real one by introducing a corresponding material distribution. Adapted from [3]. (Online version
