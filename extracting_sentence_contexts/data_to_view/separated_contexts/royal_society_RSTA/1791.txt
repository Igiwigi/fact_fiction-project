On
a scale which preserves \5876 with intensity 10 in each case, the intensity of \4471
is 19°5 in pure Helium, but only 11°2, or only half as great, when a trace of Hydrogen
is inserted. Moreover, \4026 falls in intensity from 8°69 to 1°63—or less than half. In fact, it falls even relatively to \4471, so that the result implies a definite energy
transfer of considerable amount towards the members of low term number in the
series, and more especially towards \5876. ‘This is precisely the converse phenomenon
to that found in Hydrogen itself when mixed with a large quantity of Neon or
Helium. The Sharp series of Helium behaves in the same manner, and to an extent which
is nearly equivalent, in the quantitative sense.
