The change in the value of L (when L is the latent heat of evaporation of
graven) i is small as compared with the changes in @. In fact, an accuracy of an order
Qf 4! yo of a degree would be sufficient when determining the actual elevation. 8 The heat was supplied to the calorimeter by means of a wire whose ends were kept
St a constant potential difference.
