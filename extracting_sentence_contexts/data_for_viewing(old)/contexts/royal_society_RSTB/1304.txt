ch that author, after very many trials, succeeded in causing a transpiring branch
-yaise a column of 90 centims. of mercury. The precariousness and difficulty,
wever, attending the carrying out of this observation, has precluded other experi-
_ amenters from repeating it.
_ Although osmotic actions may be concerned with the evaporative function of the
| leaf, i.c., in the transference of water into the protoplasm-filled cells ; still it is very
| probable that surface tension forces developed upon the surfaces of walls coming in
direct contact with air diffusion currents are responsible princjpally for the tensile
= forces displayed by the leaf. The fact that transpiration is not only accelerated by
direct sunshine but even more influenced by warm dry winds, supports the view that
éyolution of vapour at the leaf obeys the general laws of evaporation from a moist
surface.
_ It has, we believe, before now been pointed out that spontaneous evaporation at
the surface of a liquid into an unsaturated gas, such as the atmosphere, is of the
“sorting demon” class of molecular actions. For the more energetic molecules at the
surface of the liquid, or approaching it from beneath, have the greater chance of
freeing themselves from the sphere of molecular attraction of their fellows, and
BP ecsping into the air, This involves a cooling of the surface layer, for this is con-
& tinvally tending to a state of decreasing mean vis viva, which would at length result
*@ in the freezing of the remaining liquid if heat did not flow in, radiated or conducted
‘from surrounding objects. Hence the evaporating layer becomes a sink of energy,
