In V the “all” and “quiet” day phenomena are vitally different. The fact that
quiet” days was barely
40 per cent, of that for “all” days prepares one for a material difference between the
phenomena in the two cases, but hardly for the “all” day mean yearly value of }
being more than six times the corresponding “quiet” day value. The “quiet” day
value of a for summer is not much less than the “all” day value, but in the

‘c

the mean diurnal range during the 11-year period for the

equinoctial and winter months the latter greatly predominates. The value of b is
greatest at the equinox in both “all” and “quiet” days; in fact, in “all” days the
summer value of ) falls short of the winter value, notwithstanding a marked
depression in December and January. The variation of b/a throughout the year on
“quiet” days is somewhat irregular. In “all” days we have the fall in summer and
rise in winter seen at Kew, but there is a prominent depression in December and
January. As regards the absolute magnitudes of b and b/a, the “quiet” day data
are much closer than the “all” day to the Kew results.

Table V. gives only “all” day data for I, as no “ quiet” day data for this element
seem to be published.

Here again the phenomena resemble those observed at Kew, b being conspicuously
small in winter and b/a small in summer, The values of « and b are, on the whole,
