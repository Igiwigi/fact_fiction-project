loped in the poles, or along the apparent axes of the crystal,
descends in the scale of colour, as the thickness of the plate
increases, and vzce versa. In very small thicknesses, the tints
approximate pretty closely to NeEwToN's scale, or wholly
coincide with it, while in very great ones, the tint developed
in the poles is the composite white of the extremity of the
scale. The angular distance, however, of the virtual poles
from each other and from the axes, remains absolutely un-
changed for all thicknesses; and this striking fact, which I have
proved by numerous and satisfactory experiments, was first
suggested for examination as'a result of theory, and would
equally hold good, as will presently be proved, for every con-
ceivable law of double refraction. |
The substances which I have examined most attentively, are
sulphate of baryta, nitre, mica, and Rochelle salt, and the sub-
Joined tables of tints developed for different inclinations in
plates of the first and last of. these, may serve as examples
of the mode of action of the respectiye classes to which they
belong on light, and will afford data for some calculations
to follow. The first two columns contain the inclinations
corresponding to similar tints of the incident ray 'on the
