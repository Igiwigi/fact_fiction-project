vary between partial accordance and complete opposition to the above. It is not our
object to endeavour to reconcile this apparently conflicting evidence, but we may
point out that great difficulties are involved in the application of the tests necessary
to determine the sensibility of animals. In our own experiments, which have been
made upon Cats, and which involved hemisection of the cord, the application of the
water and other tests to the skin indicated that the afferent stimulus was conveyed
from both hind legs up the cord, but with much greater certainty, and, judging by
the quickness in the evoked movement, with much greater intensity, on the uninjured
side than on that corresponding with the lesion.

It ig evident that the flaw in all these methods is the fact that, owing to the index
of the arrival of impulses above the lesion being some movement, the central struc-
tures of the nervous system must be sufficiently excitable to be capable of responding,
and the stimulus used must be intense enough to arouse discharges of sufficient
magnitude to evoke definite muscular movements.

Whilst the same flaw in the classical experiment is also present in the case of
efferent tracts, its presence here does not produce such a blurring of the result, since
the method can always be checked by a concluding experiment involving division of
the cord below the medulla, and excitation of its distal portion, with observation of
the amount and character of the movements of the lower limbs. Although acknow-
ledging to the utmost the value and precision of the experiments carried out in
Lupwieâ€™s laboratory, we must express our conviction that, as regards the conduction
