In these passive
techniques, the flow field—originating from syringe pumps or from the channel's local slope—
promotes the natural growth of the most unstable mode of interfacial deformation. In turn, the
instability growth eventually triggers a singularity, typically yielding a topological change via
pinch-off, so that a drop is generated. Note that, while it is a singularity that generates these
drops, it is in fact the instability that provides the drop ‘blueprint’, deciding the size of each
droplet thereby ensuring the monodispersity of the emulsion. Surfactants, although not strictly
necessary to generate drops, are crucial in the process as they prevent the coalescence of newly
formed droplets—thereby stabilizing the emulsion and allowing for its packing in crystals such
as that shown in figure 18. Similarly to some of the patterns discussed throughout this article, it is an interfacial instability
that sets the size of the droplets produced in the aforementioned microfluidics processes.
