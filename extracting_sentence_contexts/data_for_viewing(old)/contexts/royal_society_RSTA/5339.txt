Compared with the times shown in the bottom half of table 3, execution is around 20% faster, [=
for the same type of source data. A similar 20-30% improvement occurs when count queries iB
are measured. The difference is accounted for by the fact that the FM-INDEX for English-200 is 2
171 MB, whereas that for English-2108 is 10 times larger, at 1875 MB. Even though the cache on 78
the test hardware is only 6 MB, it is big enough that some parts of the index that are frequently [yw
accessed remain permanently present in cache while English-200 is being searched, but to a lesser :
extent when English-2108 is being searched. That translates into measurably different execution 73
times. Large data structures are also intrinsically slower to access on most modern architectures 8
because of translation look-aside buffer misses when memory addresses are being computed. :
Gog & Petri [5] provide detailed experiments that address this issue.

To undertake valid experiments, it is thus important that the test files that are used are at a
scale that fully reflects the hardware and, conversely, for referees to be sceptical of results that
are demonstrated on datasets that are small relative to the hardware. For example, it would be
inappropriate to test a mechanism designed for secondary storage (disk or SSD) using ‘just’ 10 GB
