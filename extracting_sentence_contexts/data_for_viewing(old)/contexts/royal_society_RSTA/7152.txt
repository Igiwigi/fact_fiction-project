We consider the mapping y of H into G defined by
= ay Oi b= 6 a ic
As in G obviously aba = bF = (62)
ro one

the relations corresponding to (21-3) and (21-4) are satisfied by the maps under y. Also

bie = aba! = b
and du = (by 1c" -1bh ec’) pz = bebe = 1.
Hence the relation corresponding to (21-5) is also satisfied, even as a consequence of the more

stringent d’v = 1. The mapping y then generates a homomorphism of H into G; but this is
in fact on to G, because a, b?, c generate the whole of G. Thus we have shown:

Tuerorem. The groups G and H defined above in terms of three generators with two and three de ining
relations, respectively, are not isomorphic, but are homomorphic maps of each other. (21:6)

Ifwe combine the homorphisms of G on to H and of Hon to G, we obtain an endomorphism
of G on to itself. This maps a on to a, 6 on to 62, c on toc; its kernel is D — {d}°. Thus the
factor group G,=G/D
is isomorphic to G; but it is a proper factor group because D is not trivial. Thus we also see:

Corottary. The group G defined above in terms of three generators with two defining relations is
isomorphic to a proper factor group of itself. (21-7)
