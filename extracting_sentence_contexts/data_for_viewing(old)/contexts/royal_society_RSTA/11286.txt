briefly treated. It refers to a spiral aggregate with a central solid nucleus, and
is not of great interest. The case F uniform and f« ~ is treated more fully. If

The most striking and remarkable fact brought out is that with increasing para-
meter A, we get a periodic system of families of aggregates. The members of each
family differ from one another in the number of layers and equatorial axes they
possess. I have ventured to call them singlets, doublets, triplets, &c., in contra-
distinction to the more or less fortuitous and arbitrary compounds dealt with later,
and which I have named monads, dyads, triads, &e. Of these families two are
investigated more in detail than the others. In one family (the d, family) all the
members remain at rest in the surrounding fluid. In the other (the , family) the
