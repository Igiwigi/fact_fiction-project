This corresponds to conventional caloric effects. Nevertheless,
in some regions of the space of thermodynamic parameters, eh can be positive and, then, the
caloric effect is denoted inverse, which means that entropy increases when the field is applied
isothermally, whereas temperature decreases when it is applied adiabatically. This behaviour can

!Maxwell relations are a consequence of the fact that the generalized vector for {yj} is conservative.

ferroic properties, or associated with frustration effects, or a combination of both [6,32]. Let us now discuss multicaloric effects induced by application of more than one field. We 3
summarize here the thermodynamic development published in [33].
