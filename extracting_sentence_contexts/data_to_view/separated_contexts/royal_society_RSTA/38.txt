+ The clockwork arrangement must have interrupted the current at least ten times in one second. {Later experiments showed that the diminution of the effect of an interrupted magnetic stress as the
interruption-frequency increased arose from the fact that the difference between the vibration-frequency
of the wire and that of the interruptions increased. |

} The increases of the logarithmic decrement are ‘00346 and ‘00024 in the two cases respectively. [September 25, 1887.—It was afterwards found that the results of Experiment III. are to be attributed
almost entirely to differences between the vibration-frequency of the wire and the interruption-

frequency.
