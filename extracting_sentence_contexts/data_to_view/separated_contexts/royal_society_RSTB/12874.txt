Remarkably, well-documented biases of

One contribution of 17 to a theme issue aversion, do not apply to experience-based decisions. Here, we argue that
‘Existence and prevalence of economic the description-experience gap represents a major challenge, not only to
behaviours among non-human primates’. current decision theories, but also to the neuroeconomics research framework,

between human and non-human primate research. In fact, most non-

neuroscience, behaviour, cognition that share features of both description- and experience-based choices. As a
consequence, it is unclear whether the neural mechanisms built from non-
human primate electrophysiology should be linked to description-based or
experience-based decision-making processes. The picture is further compli-
cated by additional methodological gaps between human and non-human
