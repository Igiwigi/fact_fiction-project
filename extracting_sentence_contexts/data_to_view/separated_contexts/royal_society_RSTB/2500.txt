Schizwacee.—There is considerable variety of stelar structure in this group. — Its
anatomy has been studied by Prati, and more recently by Boopte (“On the
Anatomy of the Schizeeacew,” ‘Ann. Bot., vol. 15). A number of illustrations have
been prepared for this order, but the admirable recent work of BoopLE cited above
makes their publication unnecessary, since, in regard to the facts of structure and
development, my results are in agreement with his. In Lygodium the cauline central cylinder is protostelic, i.e, a non-medullated
concentric strand. In Anemia phyllitidis the adult stem is characterised by the
presence of so-called polystelic structure.
