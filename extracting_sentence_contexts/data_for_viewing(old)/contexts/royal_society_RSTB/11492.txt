distinguish, opening up the possibility of mistaking gameto-
phyte for sporophyte and vice versa. Examples of fossils of
ambiguous nature include some attributed to Cooksonia from
the Lower Devonian of Eifel, Germany [76]. These particular
specimens possess numerous 4 cm long bifurcating axes arising
froma central point. Each terminates in an expanded head inter-
preted as a sporangium, implying that it was a sporophyte.
Alternatively, this fossil could equally plausibly be reinter-
preted as a gametophyte [77]. The putative sporangia are
highly variable in shape, with the better developed ones resem-
bling cup-shaped gametangiophores. Furthermore, spores—a
diagnostic feature of sporangia—were not observed. Here, fea-
tures originally interpreted as sporangia might in fact be
gametangiophores fossilized at different developmental stages.

Within the current circumscription of the genus Cooksortia
[67], some fossil are undoubtedly sporophytes because
spores have been observed in situ. Others with flared, trum-
pet-shaped ends might plausibly represent a more or less
isomorphic gametophyte phase. One of these is Cooksomia
paranensis from the Early Devonian of Brazil [69]. This was inter-
preted as a sporophyte that developed from a minute thalloid
gametophyte [77]. Bifurcating axes (0.3 mm-1.1mm wide)
with flared ends (0.58mm-3.84mm wide) (sporophyte;
figure 7d) developed from a small carbonized layer at the base
