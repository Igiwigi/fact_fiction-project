Pathway Complexity has an upper bound of Ny â€” 1, where Ny is the number of vertices on the
graph. This represents joining two fundamental graphs in the first step, and then adding one more
ata time until the object is constructed. One lower bound of Pathway Complexity is logy Ny, which
represents the fact that the simplest way to increase the size of an object in a pathway is to take the
largest object so far and join it to itself, e.g. we can make an object of size 2 with one join, 4 with
2 joins, 8 with 3 joins, etc. An illustration of the upper and lower bounds of Pathway Complexity
can be seen in figure 4, with the orange regions being forbidden due to the above boundary
conditions. The green portion of the figure is illustrative of the location in the complexity space
where life might reasonably be found.
