The ellipsoidal shapes of the moons are all accurate, but are expanded by a factor of 10 relative to the orbits. :3

Hippocamp might actually be a fragment of Proteus, which was broken off by a cometary impact
early in the history of the system. Hippocamp migrates very slowly, so Proteus would have left it
behind as it migrated to its current location. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that Proteus
has one especially large crater, called Pharos, which likely ejected approximately 50 times the
volume of Hippocamp itself [39]. The history of orbital migration has been recorded in the orbital elements of some of the inner
moons. With seven moons each migrating at their own individual rates, moons must have passed
through many orbital resonances with one another [35,38].
