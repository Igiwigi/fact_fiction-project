quantity of heat radiated into space from the long, over that radiated from the short ;
$uch being the case, it was to be expected that the readings of a thermometer would
yary with every variation of the length of grass upon which it was placed, and snch
was found to be the case.

In fact, the readings of thermometers placed on grass were found to differ with
every variation of length, fineness and closeness of its blades. My experiments
have been made on that differing only in the length of its blades, and the differences
arising from this cause were found to vary with every variation of the excess of the
temperature of the air over that of long grass. The following are the mean results
of experiments in this respect :—
