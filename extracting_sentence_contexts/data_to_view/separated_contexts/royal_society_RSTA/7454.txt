BORGARS ON THE

platinum spiral. The determination of the carbon monoxide content—by removing it
with a liquid absorbent—was not possible because absorbents for carbon monoxide
also absorb oxygen. Attempts were made to remove oxygen by acid solutions of (a) chromous salts,
(6) vanadous salts, but these absorbents were useless owing to the fact that they
decompose slowly with the evolution of hydrogen. Acid solutions of titanous chloride
were found to be unsatisfactory because of their slowness in action. A satisfactory liquid absorbent for oxygen was finally obtained by substituting
trisodium phosphate (Na,PO,) for caustic soda in the normal oxygen absorbent.
