These other influences would appear to have sometimes opposed the influence in
virtue of which a sunspot pulse is followed by a magnetic pulse, and so long as the
nature of the other influences and the various inter-relationships are unknown, it
would be unsafe to assume that years of sunspot maximum always behave in the same
way as 1892 to 1894.

ยง 20. One of the possibilities suggested by Tables V. and VII. was that there might
be a periodic fluctuation in magnetic properties, which was in phase with sunspot
variations to a much greater extent in some years than in others. Various such
periods have in fact been advanced by earlier investigators. A 26-day period has
been suggested by several magneticians, including Hornsrery and Broun. Dr.
