At the same time cells which have to provide long tubes
before conjugation can take place, must suffer a considerable loss of energy in the
production of the tubes, and the surrounding conditions must make it very difficult
to replace that loss. In consequence of this one would expect to find many eases in
which the further development of the tubes had ceased after a certain amount of
growth, and also cases in which fusion of the tubes had occurred, but no spore-
formation had taken place on account of exhaustion. The observed facts suggest
this view. These considerations, then, explain both the increased length of the tubes and also
the decreased spore-formation of cells under the less favourable conditions, that have
been noted. They help to explain, moreover, the irregularities of the cells under
such conditions.
