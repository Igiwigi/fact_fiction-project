Briscoe et al. (2005) have proposed
701 using an edge-based deployment of congestion notification, which may enable
702 oartial deployment in managed networks. However, the lack of progress on
703 implementing such a price-neutral mechanism illustrates some of the technical
704 yarriers to implementing congestion pricing, let alone philosophical or economic
705 yarriers.

706 One of the areas currently under discussion in Next Generation Internet is
707 charging and economics. Users appear to have a strong preference for predictable
708 charges, such as flat rate charging, despite the fact that most users would benefit
709 rom more flexible pricing schemes (typically the majority of traffic is created by
710 a minority of users, reflecting quoted 80-20% behaviour, symptomatic of the
71 1eavy tailed traffic nature of Internet traffic). The challenge is whether more
712 usage-, quality- or congestion-based charging is desirable, and whether it can be
713 combined with simple tariffs. This is a contentious issue where strong differences
714 of opinion exist.
