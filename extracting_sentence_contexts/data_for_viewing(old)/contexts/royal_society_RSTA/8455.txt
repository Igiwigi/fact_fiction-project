(a) this correction, (6) the density correction, (c) a correction arising from the fact that
the static pressure reading was not accurately }pv,2, and (d) the swirl correction. The
pressures given represent the normal pressure divided by $V, where V is the speed of
the centre of the spheroid, and is constant for all attitudes of the spheroid when the
angular velocity of the arm is constant. It should be noted, however, that as in ยง 15


NORMAL PRESSURES ON A PROLATE SPHEROID, 245

it was not possible to repeat accurately any particular speed : the speed quoted is, there-
fore, the mean of a number, each of which approximates very closely to the mean. The
actual speed has, of course, been used in calculating the coefficients. Further, in view of
the fact that the pressures have been divided by V* and not by v*, there area few points
where the pressure coefficient exceeds unity.

20. The method of procedure may be expressed symbolically as follows :

p is the pressure at a point P.

V and v the speeds through the air of the centre and of P respectively.

V, and v, the speeds over the ground of the centre and of P respectively.

V, = 2, the speed of the static pressure tube over the ground.
