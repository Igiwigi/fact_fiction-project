mical relation between the oxygen and potassium, in the same way as a negative
and positive electricity are related to each other. The same is true of the relation
between any other two particles of the system. Hence chemical decomposition is an
essential condition of chemical combination ; 80 that when we see one of these eyents
we may infer the other.

On the other hand, where this polar division of the substance cannot take place,
there is no chemical action, or at any rate it takes place with greater difficulty ; thus
anhydrous sulphuric acid may (as has been shown by M1LLox) be distilled off carbo-
nate of potash without alteration, and generally the s0-called anhydrous acids have
none of the combining properties of the hydrates to which they correspond. The
reason of this being, that when these bodies combine they do not decompose, and
that it is by the very fact alone of the decomposition of the substance that the com-
bining power is developed in the particles of which they consist, s0 that in the che-
mical change which is thus representedâ€”
