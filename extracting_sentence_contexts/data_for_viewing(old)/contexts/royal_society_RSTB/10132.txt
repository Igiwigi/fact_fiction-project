Even leaving aside the fact that it ignores the archaeological
studies that also refute the hypothesis, there are two reasons to
reject this criticism. One is that most of the hunter-gatherer popu-
lation size estimates [46-49] were obtained in the same way as the
ones for the food-producers [6,7]. Given that the latter support the
hypothesis, there is no reason to think that the former are biased
against finding an association between population size and
technological complexity. Significantly, proponents of the popu-
lation size hypothesis have repeatedly cited the results of the
food-producer studies in a positive manner [26,53].

The other reason to reject Henrich’s criticism relates to the
fact that several of the hunter-gatherer studies indicate that
technological complexity is negatively associated with environ-
mental productivity [46-50]. Because the population size
hypothesis predicts a positive association between toolkit com-
plexity and population size, Henrich’s criticism only works if
the ‘real’ population size estimates track the negative relation-
ship between toolkit complexity and environmental
productivity. That is, for Henrich’s criticism to work, hunter—
gatherer population sizes need to be negatively associated
with environmental productivity just like toolkit complexity.
Obviously, this is counterintuitive. Based on first principles,
we expect to see larger populations in more productive environ-
ments. Indeed, this is the relationship that has been identified.
