species of animal in the representation in the nervous system of respiration and
phonation respectively.

The need for efficient respiratory action on the part both of the larynx and the
thorax is much greater in the younger animal than in the adult, and is greater, as
LeGALLoIs more especially has shown, in the Cat and the Horse than in any other
animal, especially more than in the Dog. The present part of our paper will be
devoted to summarising the facts that we have observed and the differences noted
according to the age of the animal, and we shall group the results, as before, according
to the species, beginning again with the highest.

(a.) Monkey.—In the Monkey we have only incomplete observations owing to the
difficulty of obtaining many Monkeys, but all our observations went to show that
phonatory adduction was less represented in the young animal than in the older adult.

().) Dog.—In the Dog these differences are also marked. In the young Dog even
with strong currents we have frequently only obtained from the focus of laryngeal
phonatory representation a high degree of acceleration of respiration with marked
diminution of abduction, but no complete adduction ; in fact in the cortex of such an
animal, while respiration is most efficiently represented, phonation is only imperfectly
