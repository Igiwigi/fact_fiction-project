tree. Darwin’s goal was to define a theory that was on a par with the other greats of science.
In the remaining chapters of the Origin, Darwin was faithful to Whewell’s ‘consilience of
inductions’ [5].

One can think of Whewell’s philosophy in lay terms by comparing it to a hypothetical murder
investigation [5]. Imagine a prosecutor in a murder trial who makes his case by showing that we
have motive, means, a blood stained carpet and a murder weapon that links the accused with
the victim. With all this evidence, who needs a body or an eyewitness to the crime? So it was for
Darwin and Mendeleev. Each martialed and organized masses of empirical evidence into simple,
graphical models—a tree and a table. Each of them did so long before there was full empirical
evidence to show that their constructs were correct. The facts that followed are not what defined
their accomplishments as so fundamental to their respective disciplines. Rather, the reverse is
true. Their contributions, built on imperfect and incomplete facts, synthesized those facts into
coherent organizing principles that guided the efforts of those who followed.

I will close with some comparisons between the periodic table and the theory of evolution in
the history that followed their publication.


5. The impact of new discoveries

The growth of knowledge in biology, chemistry and physics after the key publications of 1859
(Darwin) and 1869 (Mendeleev) filled fundamental gaps in knowledge that had the potential to
prove that both proposals were wrong. In the end, both of these organizing principles survived
the challenges because their foundations were correct. Both of them evolved as they absorbed the
