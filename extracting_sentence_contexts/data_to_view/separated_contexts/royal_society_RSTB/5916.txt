40 and 41). The other (J. L. S.) was impressed by the remarkable likeness to the endocranial cast
of Sinanthropus of the brain of the Bushwoman, described in 1865 by Professor Joun
Marsuauti. The recognition of these facts adds particular importance to the con-
sideration that both the authors of this communication have served an apprenticeship
to the task by examining large series of primitive brains, aboriginal Australians (J. L. S.)
and Sudanese negroes (G. H.8.), and have devoted some attention to the comparison
of the brains of the anthropoid apes and primitive men. In attempting to interpret
the significance of the endocranial cast of Sinanthropus special attention must obviously
be paid to comparison with the casts of Pithecanthropus and Eoanthropus. The com-
parison with the brains of the larger apes is also important, throwing light as it does
upon the characters one ought to expect to find in extremely primitive human brains.
