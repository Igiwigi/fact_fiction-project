Above, Sâ€™(R?) denotes the space
of tempered distributions, the dual to the space S(R7) of smooth, rapidly decreasing functions. The significance of the space BS oo in turbulence was already noted by Eyink [50] in the context
of the Kraichnan-Batchelor theory of two-dimensional turbulence. In fact, if u solves the two-
dimensional Navier-Stokes (respectively, Euler) equations, then its (scalar) vorticity # =curl u
satisfies (2.1) (respectively, (2.3)). The Navier-Stokes and Euler equations in vorticity-velocity
formulation have active transport, since u depends on w via the Biot-Savart law (for recent results
on renormalizing certain active transport equations we refer to [51]). We recall that the enstrophy
is defined as the L?-norm squared of vorticity, so formally the problem of anomalous enstrophy
dissipation is equivalent to the problem of anomalous scalar dissipation.
