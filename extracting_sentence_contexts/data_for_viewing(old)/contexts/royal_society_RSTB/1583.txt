posterior walls of each sac seemed to be closely attached to the corresponding
margins of the bony recess, in which the sac itself is partially enclosed, while the
inwew wall is similarly adherent to the lateral surtace of the complex centrum, to the
triangular ventral process, and to the dorsal lamina. The rigid skeletal attachments
of Hie two air-sucs are stihstantially similar to those of the similarly modified air-
bladders of Bagarius and Glyptosternum, and, probubly, as we shall point out more
particularly in our description of the last-mentioned genus, are capable of strict
comparison with the attachments of a normal anterior chamber, or, at least, present
only such differences as are necessitated by the constriction of the bladder into two
distinct lateral divisions. Although obvious enough elsewhere, we could detect no
definite disposition of fibres in the dorsal wull of either of the two air-saes, neither
could we trace the usual convergence of fibres from the antero-lateral and outer walls
towards the crescentic process of the tripus; in fact the dorsal wall of both sacs
appeared to be represented solely by an extremely thin stratum of connective tissne,
We ave inelined to regard this stratum as belonging to the inner tunic, the tunica
; externa of the dorsal wall having completely atrophied. We were unable to discover
any trace of an investing epithelium, but failure in this respect was probably due to
the ill-preserved condition of the specimen. It is, of course, possible that the apparent
degeneration of the proper fibrous portion of the dorsal wall may also he the result of
the same cause, but from the undoubted existence of similar structural lesions in
other abnormal Silurids we prefer, provisionally at any rate, to regard this condition
as normal so far as Akysis is concerned,

The possibility that structural defects in the connection of the walls of the
: air-bladder with the tripodes might be correlated with the existence of similar
