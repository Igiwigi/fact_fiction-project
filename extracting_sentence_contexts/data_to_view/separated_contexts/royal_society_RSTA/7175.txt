It will be seen that at tem-
peratures between 140 and 205째 C the rate of crystallization is too fast to be measured with
any accuracy by the density balance technique, and that around 180째 C the crystallization

processes are rapid. The flat portion of the curve between 220 and 230째 CG may be con-
nected with the fact that the heat of crystallization raises the temperature of the crystal-
lizing sample by as much as 4째 C above that of the surrounding Silicone oil. This was
ascertained by inserting a thin thermocouple in the polymer in the annular space in the
gauze container. A similar phenomenon has been described by Tamman (1926) in non-
polymeric crystallizing systems.
