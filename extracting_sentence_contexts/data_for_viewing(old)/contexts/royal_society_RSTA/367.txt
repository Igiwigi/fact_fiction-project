it would be wrong to neglect them as abstractions resting upon precarious
rypotheses’.

The responses to the paradox mentioned at the end of §3 are similarly
dissatisfying—they address the relevance of the problem and argue that it would
never really arise, but they do not resolve it. As the paradoxical aspect is the
sehaviour of real people, however, these arguments are valid, and all means of
disposing of the paradox could be similar in character.

While Bernoulli’s observations of human risk aversion and even the functional
form he proposed for modelling these are ‘correct’ in a specific sense elaborated in
86, these behavioural regularities have a physical reason that Bernoulli failed to
point out. In fact, it appears that he was not aware of this physical reason, which
justifies only ug(w) =In(w). Bernoulli {1, p. 33] did not consider the anit’
form of utility essential and wrote of Cramer’s work, which uses uc(w) = /w:
‘Indeed I have found his theory so similar to mine that it seems miraculous that
we independently reached such close agreement on this sort of subject’.

5. Ergodicity

The question of ergodicity in stochastic systems is concerned with a conceptual
choice in giving meaning to quantitative probabilities. It can be argued that it
is meaningless to assign a probability to a single event, and that any decision
regarding a single event must resort to intuition or morals. For mathematical
guidance, the event has to be embedded within other similar events. Fermat and
