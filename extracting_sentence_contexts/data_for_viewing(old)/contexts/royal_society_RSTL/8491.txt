72. The modular equation for any value of » has the property that it may be repre-
sented as an equation of the same order (=n+1, when » is prime) between u, v or
between 47, v*, or between v!, v', or between uf, 2%. As to this, remark that in general
an equation (2, v, 1)"=0 of the order m gives rise to an equation (2, #*, 1)"=0' of
the order 2172 between ?, v*; viz. the required equation is

(u, v, 1)"(u, —v, 1)*(—u, v, 1)"(—u, —v, 1)"=0,

where the left-hand side is a rational function of 4, v* of the form (u?, v*, 1)"; or
again starting ſrom a given equation (#, v, w)"=0, and transforming by the equations
w:y:2=0e: 2:17, the curvein (2,y, 2) is of the order 292; in fact the intersections of the
curye by the arbitrary line ar+by+c2=0 are given by the equations (#, v, w)"=0,
an*+br+en*=0, and the number of them is thus =2m. Moreover, by the general
theory of rational transformation, the new curve of the oxder 212 has the same deficiency
as the original curye of the order mz. The transformed curve in a, y, 2, =1?, v%, w* may
in particular cases reduce itself to a curye of the order m twice repeated; but it is
important to observe that here, taking the single curve of the order m2 as the transformed
curye, this has no longer the same deficiency as the original curve; and in particular
the curves represented by the modular equation in its four seyeral forms, writing therein
8uccessively wu, v; 4, v*; W, v*; w, v*, =o, y, are not curyes of the same deficiency.

73. The question may be looked at as follows: the quantities which enter rationally
into the elliptic-function formule are *, *=1f, v5; if a modular equation (#, v)"=0
