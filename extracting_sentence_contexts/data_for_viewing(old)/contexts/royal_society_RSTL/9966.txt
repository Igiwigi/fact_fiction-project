It will be observed that the iodide of lead, as in the case of the iodide of mercury
(vide p. 1142), has three coefficients of expansion, viz. :—(@) a coefficient 80mewhat less
than that of chloride of silver up to 253 C.; (b) a coefficient during 12? C., nearly


HALOID COMPOUNDS OF SILVER, MERCURY, LEAD, AND COPPER 1145

eight times greater than the preceding; and (ec) finally a coefficient s0mewhat more
than twice as great as that between 0* and 258 C., at temperatures above 265® C,
Undoubtedly the iodide of lead, as in the case of the iodide of mercury, undergoes a
molecular change, while rapidly expanding between 253* C. and 265® C., and before
assuming the higher coefficient. This is supported by the fact that the highly brittle
and crystalline rod showed itself capable of bending after having undergone the rapid
expansion. Tt will be remembered that the iodide of silyer, which is very crystalline
and brittle below 145* C., becomes amorphous and plastic above that temperature.
The familiar example of sulphur will also recur to the mind.

Q If we suppose a mass of iodide of lead to be heated from 0* C. to the melting point,

(383? C.) the following will be the volumes at the respective temperatures ;—
