The resulb was the same in each case.

Reference to the curve will show that, as we anticipated, the solubility of sodium
Sulphate does increase again when the temperature is carried high enough.

The peculiarities of sodium sulphate in regard to its solubility have always formed
an interesting problem, but we venture to think its interest is enhanced by this

discovery, because it seems impossible, by appeal to the commonly received theories of
golution, to find a satisfactory explanation of all the facts of the case. If we admit that
sodium sulphate, placed in contact with water ab temperatures below 34®, dissolves
in virtue of its power of entering into union with water to form liquid hydrates,
the diminished solubility above that temperature must be due to dissociation of
these hydrates, and production of the anhydrous salt, which is apparently much less
soluble. What then is the cause of the much greater soJubility of the ordinary
crystals in which the salt is already united with a large quantity of water, and how
can we explain the fact that the anhydrous alt increases in s0lubility in accordance
with the common rule when the temperature is raised? The explanation appears to
be found in the difference of fusibility of the two compounds, Na,SO,10HzO melting
at 34®, and Na,SO,, which melts at 860*.

There is nothing new in the idea that readiness to melt by heat is associated with
