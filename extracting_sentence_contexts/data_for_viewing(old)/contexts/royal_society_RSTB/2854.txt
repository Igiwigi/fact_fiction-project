in homosporous forms ; the capacity of increase is thus structurally evident in them.

(3). The Archegoniate sporophytes illustrate by numerous examples the sterilisation
of spore-producing cells, so as to form temporary nutritive cells, or permanent

vegetative tissues. The converse, .¢., the transformation of normally sterile into
fertile cells, exists, but it is of rare occurrence. These facts indicate a prevalence of
progressive increase of sporogenous tissue, coupled with progressive sterilisation.

(4). An inerease in spore-output demands an increased vegetative system for
protection and nutrition, and for mechanisms of dissemination ; the tissues which
result from progressive sterilisation contribute to meet this demand.

The above theses apply to all homosporous Archegoniatee.

In addition to the features above noted there are four further primary factors, which
may be recognised as involved in the structural advance of the sporophyte from
simpler beginnings to such conditions as we see in its more elaborate forms, viz. :
