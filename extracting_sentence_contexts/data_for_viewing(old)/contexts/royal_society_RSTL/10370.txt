S owing to the partial disappearance of the cells of the primary medullary rays. The

£ 13 jus referred to; but at b we have a hypodermal zone of specialised bundles of
D what seem to have been prosenchymatous cells. Each bundle has a triangular section,
© the apex being centripetal, and is from *012 to *008 from base to apex. The onter-
S most bark, c, appears to have been a thin epidermal layer, some *003 to *002 in thickness.
:= The peripheral border of this zone is sharply defined and entire, being wholly devoid

S those outer surfaces possessed neither longitudinal flutings nor nodal constrictions.
