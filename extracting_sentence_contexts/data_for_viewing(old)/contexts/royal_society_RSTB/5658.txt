renders this a probable explanation, and it is further supported by the fact that
various fungi are known to store reserve carbohydrates and utilise them later as
occasion demands, e.g., glycogen in yeast, trehalose in A. niger.

A definite proof was obtained that kojic acid itself is produced from xylose, and is
really responsible for the colour reaction with this carbohydrate, by growing A. effusus
on 500 ¢.c. CzaPEK-Dox solution containing 5 per cent. of xylose. This medium was
distributed in two 750 c.c. conical flasks, and incubated for eleven days at 23° C. The
liquid was filtered from the mycelium, evaporated to small bulk and extracted with
ether in a continuous extraction apparatus. The crystals separating from the ether
were recrystallised from acetone, and had then a melting point of 152°C. Total yield,
