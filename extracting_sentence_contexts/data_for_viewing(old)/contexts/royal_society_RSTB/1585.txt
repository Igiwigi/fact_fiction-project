of the root of the creseentic process of the tripus, and is in close contiguity with the
< elnilar insertion of the radial fibres of that ossicle. As the contraction of these
% muscles would probably have the effect of tightening such fibres, and, therefore,
© restrict the lateral movements of the tripodes, we venture to suggest for each the name
® of “tensor tripodis.” The radial fibres of the tripus are strongly developed, but
QB otherwise ave normal.
S Apart from the outer stratum of the anterior wall of the bladder, which is dorsally
6 wttached to the complex centrum, to the radial nodules and to the dorsal lamina, as
2 well as to the transverse processes of the fourth vertebra, we could detect no equivalent:
% to the transverse membrane of other Siluroids. It is possible, however, that the outer
@ stratum includes, not only « portion of the tunica externa of the anterior wall, but
‘2 the troneyerse membrane as well; at all events, such an explanation is suggested
E by the fact. that the outer stratum has the characteristic attachment of the transverse
3 membrane to the dorsal laminte, which is, apparently, never the case with any
= portion of the proper tunica externa in other Siluroids. “All the normal Pimelodina:
2 that we have examined resemble Platystoma in this respect.
2 A amiall cxeeal appendage is closely attached to each of the lateral walls of the
= snterior chamber, and is partially overlapped by the great compressor muscle of' its
& side (figs, 33 and 34, al.c.), The cavity of this curious appendage communicates witli
5 that of the anterior chatber by means of a number of slit-like apertures in the outer
3 wall of the utter (fig. 34).  Anteriorly, each emcum separates from the wall of the
E ladder, aud expmnds into a pear-shaped enlargement, which is in contact with the
6 inter surfice of the dorsal extremity of the clavicle, The cavity of the appendage is
broken up inte « series of intercommunicating spaces by a network of fibrous bundles,
and the tunica interna is prolonged outwards from the anterior chamber through the
