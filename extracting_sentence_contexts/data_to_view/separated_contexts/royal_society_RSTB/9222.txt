Given the involvement of PPC
in unimodal and multisensory attention functions, this region
offers great potential as a neuromodulation target for learning
and attention training interventions [12].

(ii) Reference frame remapping

Because sensory information conveyed by each modality
may be represented in particular spatial reference frames
(e.g. tactile information in body-centred coordinates), inte-
gration of sensory inputs, in particular to guide actions, may
require remapping neural representations into crossmodally
consistent coordinate systems. NIBS studies in humans indicate
that the remapping of sensory information from body-centred
to external coordinates relies on the PPC. Bolognini & Maravita
[13] explored the role of PPC in aligning tactile and visual refer-
ence frames by exploiting the fact that a touch felt on the hand
enhances visual cortex excitability only at visual field locations
coinciding with the stimulated hand’s position in visual space. Using phosphenes induced by TMS [14] as a measure of visual
cortex excitability, Bolognini & Maravita [13] showed that
phosphene sensitivity increases in the right hemifield only
when the touched right hand occupies the same position as
the reported phosphene location. Moreover, if the arms are
crossed and the left hand is positioned to the right of body
midline, touch to the left hand, but not the right, increases
phosphene sensitivity in the right hemifield.
