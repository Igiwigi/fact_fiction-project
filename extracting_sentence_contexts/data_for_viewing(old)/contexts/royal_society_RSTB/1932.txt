motility, there was no ptosis, nor were the opening or closing movements of the lids
in any way affected. The head and eyes were deviated to the right ; both pupils were
dilated, but reacted to light. As the monkey was somewhat apathetic, it was diflicult
to determine accurately the condition as to sensation, but there was no evidence of
tactile sensibility on either side, although it responded to pricking and pinching the
fingers and toes upon both sides. The monkey was killed upon the fifth day after the
second operation without any obvious change having occurred in the symptoms.

The autopsy revealed that both frontal lobes and both angular gyri had been
destroyed, the frontal lobe and angular gyrus being rather more extensively
removed on the left side. The condition of the cerebrum is shown in Plate 1, fig. 2.

The facts qui ocular movements as ascertained from this experiment indicate :â€”

1. That both frontal lobes may be removed without any impairment in the
movements of the eyeballs other than a temporary inability to turn them
to the side away from the lesion ;

2. That in addition to the frontal lobes the angular gyri may be removed without
any further impairment in the movements of the eyes or of the eyelids.

The influence of the lesion upon vision will be considered after the experiment
of destroying the pulvinar thalami has been described.

Some further facts upon the symptoms following removal of the frontal lobes are
