and we have shown that this fraction is equivalent to that portion of the expansi
the fraction
1
2 {l—s(2a+B+4)} {1—t(2a + 28 + y)} {1 —u(2e + 28 + 2y)}
which is a function only of sa, ¢8, and wy.

41. It will now be shown that the fraction

1
2 — 8, (2a, + ay +... + ay) } {1 — 89 (Qe, + 2g +... + ty) }... {1 — 8, (Qe, + Zerg +... + 2m

is, in fact, a generating function which enumerates the compositions of multipa
numbers of order n.

This important theorem will be demonstrated by showing that the aggregate
terms in the expansion of the last written fraction, which is composed entirely
powers of $10), S90), . . . Sy%q, is correctly represented by the fraction

1
| 2 eee
2 1-2 (Zsa, — B s5eytg +... ("71 48q. « . Syeryag. - - on)

which has been already shown to be a true generating function.
