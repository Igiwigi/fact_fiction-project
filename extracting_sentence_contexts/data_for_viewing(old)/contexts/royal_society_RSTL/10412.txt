Brooks was the first, to point out, in the cage of the Oyster, in 1879, that the eggs of
the ame species, or even of the same individual, may normally undergo more than
one mode of development, He described in the Oyster two forms of segmentation,
of which one was clearly derived by an abbreviation of the other. Intermediate
forms were not, however, observed, and the eggs could not be said to exhibit
variation except in one definite direction. In Renilla the eggs vary in many direc-
tions, and the different forms of development must be due to varying sbruetural
arrangements within the egg.

This fact of extremely early variation is, T believe, one of great importance. Tt,

is evident that a structural variation in one of the segmentation spheres must

_ make itself felt, to a greater or less extent, in the structure and development of

* the cells derived from it, and may therefore appear ultimately as symmetrical or
correlated variations in the larva or adult organism,

Leptogorgia, like Renilla, is dicecious, and the eggs are fertilized in the water
after their discharge from the parent. The eggs are slightly smaller (-30 millim.),
d of a rosy tint, but are otherwise quite similar to those of PRenilla. They are
Yischarged in the same manner through the mouths of the polyps, and at the 8ame
