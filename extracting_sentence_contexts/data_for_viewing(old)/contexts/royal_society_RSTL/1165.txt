was a litter of pigs, some of which we observed, with much
surprize, to be stained and clearly marked with the ches-
nut colour which had prevailed in the former litter.

This sow had afterwards another litter of pigs by a boar
of Mr. WEsTERN's breed, and I think, and s0 does my bailiff,
that some of these were also slightly marked with the ches-
nut colour ; but though we noticed the recurrence with sur-
prize, it is 80 long since, that our recollection is much less
perfect than I wish it to be.


24 Daxitr GiLEs, Esq. on a singular fact, &c,

I should observe, that I have known Mr. WxsTzrN's breed

many years, but never in any other instance observed the least
appearance of the chesnut colour.

Believe me, &c.
