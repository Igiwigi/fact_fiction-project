1. Introduction.

Is the last communication which I had the honour of pre-
senting to the Royal Society, I stated a number of facts, which
inclined me to believe, that the body improperly called in the
modern nomenclature of chemistry, ozymuriatic acid gas, has
not as yet been decompounded.; but that it is a peculiar sub-
stance, elementary as' far as our knowledge extends, and
atalogous in many of its properties to oxygene gas,

My objects in the present Lecture, are to detail a number
of experiments. which I have made for the purpose of illus-
trating more fully the nature, properties, and combinations of
this substance, and its attractions for inflammable boates, as
compared with those of oxygene; and likewise to present
