air, and alkalies, quick-lime, and magnesia. His experiments
'also shewed, that many properties of these bodies depended
upon the union and separation of this air. The discovery of
these facts established this elastic fluid to be a peculiar species
of substance.

Mr. CavenDisn, Dr. BRowNR166, Dr. PRIESTLEY, Sir TorR-
BERN BERGMAN, Mr. BEWLEY, Mr. K1Rwan, and other che-
mists, afterwards extended, very considerably, the history of
fixed air. The question, whether it was a simple or compound
body, was discussed ; and by many persons it was believed to have
been proved, that fixed air was.composed of phlogiston and re-
spirable air. But some of the principal facts, upon which this
belief was founded, being afterwards demonstrated to be erro-
neous ; and the production of fixed air being, to the apprehen-
sion of many chemists, more satisfactorily accounted for by the
new principles of chemistry, this doctrine of its composition
became no longer tenable. As the science of chemistry ad-

vanced, many acids were demonstrably proved to consist of a
peculiar basis, and respirable air ; and on the ground of analogy
it was concluded, that all other acids were composed in a si-
