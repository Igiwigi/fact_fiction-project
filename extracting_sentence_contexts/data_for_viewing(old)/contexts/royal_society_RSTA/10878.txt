- while the amount of material ejected was so small, is one of the most interesting

features of the eruptions, and calls for special discussiou when we come to consider
the mechanism of these discharges.

In St. Vincent no fissures are known to have opened on the hill-sides, no flows of
hot mud lava have welled out of the mountain, and there is a complete absence of
fumaroles or minor steam emissions, except from the boiling lake within the crater.
But in Martinique early in the eruption the rivers began to flow full of muddy water,
and on May 5th the Etang Sec broke through its barriers and, discharging into the
Riviere Blanche, sent down a torrent of hot mud which buried the Usine Guérin,
Fissure formation and hot mud-flows did not end here, they are one of the dominant
features of the eruption of Pelée, and some interesting facts regarding them are
contained in the Preliminary Report of the French Commissioners.* Along the course
of the Rividre Séche, and in the district between that and the Rivitre Blanche,
numerous fumaroles have appeared which indicate the presence of a series of fissures
in that quarter. They are probably radial in direction, and may be crossed by
another series (tangential) on which lie certain fumaroles near the sea-shore. On the
north-west side of Montagne Pelée there is, at Ajoupa Bouillon, a fumarole which has
poured out large quantities of muddy water, and this may lie on a prolongation of
the radial fissures on the south-east side of the crater. They are not characterised
by gaping cracks, but rise through the old or new ash deposits, and give evidence of
their presence by emanations of steam and sulphuretted hydrogen. Some of them
are at a temperature sufficiently high to melt pieces of lead inserted into the orifice.
