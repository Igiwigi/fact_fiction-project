In addition to the refined fibre arrangement, the protein matrix in the fangs of C. salei is
also enriched with metal ions. Zn ions in a concentration of up to approximately 6 at. % in the
fangâ€™s tip promote local hardening and stiffening of the cuticle by cross-linking with histidine
residues [14,40]. Interestingly however, abrasion resistance in the fang is comparable with that
in the Mn and Ca enriched claw, despite the fact that the former contains more than three times
the amount of metal ions [15]. The smoothness of the surface of the fang tip suggests that friction
is reduced as compared to the ventral surface of the claw [41]. The smooth surface will allow
the spiders to use their fangs to repeatedly puncture prey cuticle and to retract the fangs, as
observed during prey capture and feeding.
