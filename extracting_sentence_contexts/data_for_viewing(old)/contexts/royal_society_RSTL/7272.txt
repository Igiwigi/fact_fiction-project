organic compound the acid character. We believe, therefore, that its claims to be con»
sidered a compound radical are at least equal to those of any other group of elements
to which that term has been applied.

We propose for this radical the name ozaty!*—a word recalling at the same time it:

We have, in fact, experimentally proved above, that when ethylic oxalate is acted upon
by nascent amy], it is converted into ethylic caproate,

Oxatyl is closely related to cyanogen, the two radicals passing into each other in a
host of reactions; hence the production of cyanides from the ammonium salts of the. |
fatty acids on the one hand, and the synthesis of acids from certain cyanogen compounds.
on the other—a reaction first pointed out by KoLBe and FRANKLANDF, and which has of
late yielded such magnificent results in the hands of MAxwELL S1xesoN4 and of KoLBB
and Hugo Miller. bn
