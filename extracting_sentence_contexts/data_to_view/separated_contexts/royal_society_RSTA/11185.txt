The differences between the coefficients of linear expansion along the three
erystallographical axial directions of any one salt, although only amounting to one-
eighth of the total coefficient, are large compared with the differences between the
values for the same direction of the three salts. S 6. The operation of rule 5, together with the fact that the replacement of one
+;metal by another is accompanied by considerable modifications of the relations of two
‘gof the three values for the original salt, those corresponding to the axes @ and ¢,
Bprevent the coefficients of linear expansion for any one direction of the three salts
“from exhibiting any progression corresponding to that of the atomic weights of the
—three metals. These directional perturbations are, however, mutually compensative,
s, so that the effect of interchange of the metals is clearly exhibited by the solid defor-
6 mation, the cubical expansion, the coefficients of which and their increments have
been shown to exhibit a progression according to the atomic weight of the metal, as
< stated in rule 1.
‘3 7. The increment of the linear coefficient of expansion for the direction of the
E vertical axis ¢ of each salt, is about twice as large as the increments for the other two
‘8 directions a and 5, for which latter the increments are nearly equal.
