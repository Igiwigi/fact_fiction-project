At
any rate no such grey series, of 360 feet in thickness, has yet been recognised among
what are generally termed the productive measures in the Wyre Forest. I have entered somewhat at length into this matter, in order to point out that the
correlation of Claverley, as part of the South Staffordshire Coalfield, should not be
accepted without hesitation. As a matter of fact, as I have shown, there are diffi-
culties in recognising in the Claverley beds either the South Staffordshire or the
Wyre Forest lithological sequence, and judgment on the main point at issue is best
suspended until more evidence is â€˜available. It is quite an open question whether
Claverley does not represent a distinct coalfield. In conclusion, if there is little correspondence between the Transition Measures ot
the Wyre Forest and the Midland fields, there is still less when we compare the beds
belonging to the same horizon in the Potteries Coalfield..
