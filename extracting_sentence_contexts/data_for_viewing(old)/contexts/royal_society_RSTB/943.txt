374 MISS M. GREENWOOD ON THE CONSTITUTION AND MODE

structural change here as in the case of Ameba or Actinospherium.* A polype, j
which fifty successive acts of aggregation have been observed, does not, save fop i,
abundant ingesta, differ from one that is fasting. It is rather on @ priori grounds
then, that I am inclined to localize the formation of viscid matter in the period
periods which precede aggregation. The period of quiescence, which has so dram
an ending, is in itself devoid of obvious event; there is then too great readine
perhaps, to associate with it, in thought, some phasic heightening of obs
molecular activity. As a matter of fact, quiescence tends to vary inversely as
gression, in other words, a fairly constant interval elapses between the moment of
ingestion and the aggregation of ingested particles. And, throughout this interval,
there is typically continuation of “ proper” movement or of Brownian movement with |
undiminished energy, though rarely I have seen considerable excursions of the
peripheral particles in a vacuole round an apparently viscid central mass. I conceive
that the retractile substance does not, when first formed (possibly immature), offer an
effective hindrance to the oscillation of fine particles or the movement of small
organisms, that it may vary in amount and condition, thus offering a varying
resistance to movement, and that it is probably accumulated in the vacuole
of ingestion during the period of quiescence, although the possibility of
earlier formation cannot be excluded.
