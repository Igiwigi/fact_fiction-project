radial tube. Still it mnst here be carefully noted, that in at least three other species
belonging to another genus, viz. Tiaropsis diademata, T. polydiademata, and T. oligo-
plocama, spasmodic movements in no way distinguishable from those of Staurophora
laciniata invariably follow upon stimulation of any part of the organism, or even of a
minute portion of the contractile tissue when excised. Hence the usual failure of
Staurophora laciniata to respond spasmodically to irritation of its contractile tissues is
probably due to their being somewhat less irritable than those of the other species
named,

(c) For my investigation of these spasmodic movements I chose Staurophora laciniata
because, from its large size, it admitted of my performing various modes of section which
would be impracticable in the case of the other naked-eyed Meduse. Moreover, as the
principal point to be inquired into had reference to the fact that these movements were
most readily elicited by stimulating the marginal or radial tubes, this species seemed
particularly well suited to the purposes of my inquiry ; for, as we have just seen, the
degree of its irritability is such as to cause the animal to respond spasmodically to the

Slightest irritation of the marginal or radial tubes, while even to violent irritation of the
contractile tissues the only response is a locomotor contraction. The first point I endea-
vyoured to settle was whether the faculty of originating a tonic spasm in answer to a
Stimulus was absolutely restricted, in the case of Staurophora laciniata, to the marginal
and radial tubes, or such faculty was likewise shared by a s8mall band of the contractile
tissue in the immediate neighbourhood of these tracts.
