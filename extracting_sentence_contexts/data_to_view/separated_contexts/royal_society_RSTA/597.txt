No, because there is no initial pattern to be univocally mapped into a macroscopic change (like the
position of a pointer). The only information-driven interaction occurs between the ‘classical end’
of the instrument with the observer (sensory effect of the macroscopic change in the instrument
on the observer's brain or a human-designed recorder). The important fact for our discussion is that when an ensemble of initially entangled quantum
systems has decohered, it will behave classically, furnishing the same results in an immediately
following succession of identical measurements (neglecting experimental errors). Only then can
we define patterns required for information-driven interactions—such interactions cannot occur
at the non-decohered quantum level, and pragmatic information cannot exist and operate in, or be
extracted from, the quantum domain. A logical consequence is the so-called no-cloning theorem: a
single quantum system in a superposed state cannot be copied, unless the original is destroyed
in the process.
