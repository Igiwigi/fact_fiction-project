Innutritious matter shows quite comp
able accumulation of fluid and subsequent loss with maximum approximation of
particles, especially if ingestion be carried on in the dark. Mounting at this sta,
provokes ejection, but not, as a rule, fresh secretion of fluid. In fact, the gre
majority of experiments support the view that the cell substance is, on the whole, di
criminating in its secretion of fluid with which the solution of food is immediate
associated, but that the formation and clotting of viscous matter in the vacuole
ingestion is called forth by ingesta of all kinds. Since the food ingested naturally by Carchesium is very largely made up
bacteria, and may therefore be actively motile, it is conceivable that there is need
of some speedy and effective action on the prey, and that this necessity has concer
trated the secretion of the potent retractile substance and generated the habit
uniform response to all ingested matter. On the other hand it may be that ind
criminate aggregation is arrived at in quite another fashion; the viscid matter
so intimately related to the actual process of digestion, that no entering vacuol
whatever its contents, is sent on unprovided with its share of so important a factor.
