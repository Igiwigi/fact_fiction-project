We followed that up by replacing CuNi with
pure Ni, and found a somewhat larger, but still rather small, T, difference [61]. Since then, many
groups have contributed to this area, using both F/S/F’ and S/F’/F configurations. There was
some controversy over the fact that either the parallel or antiparallel configuration can have a
larger Tc, which depends partly on the relative importance of exchange physics and stray field
effects. We will not discuss here the many papers addressing that topic. The culmination of this
work is the observation of complete switching between the normal-state resistance and zero
resistance by changing from the parallel to the antiparallel magnetization state, which has been
achieved in an S/F’/F system by a Russian—German collaboration [62], and in a FI/S/FI system
(where FI = ferromagnetic insulator) by Moodera’s group at MIT [63].
