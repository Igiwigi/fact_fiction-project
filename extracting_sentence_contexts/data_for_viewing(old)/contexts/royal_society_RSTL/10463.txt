the most important points, and that, however much those relations may apparently
be disturbed by various localisation of 8ubsequent growth, the changes thus induced
are to be regarded as but of secondary importance. .

In dealing with the leaf this principle is not kept 80 clearly before the mind, and
the explanation is doubtless to be found in the fact that the intercalary growth is
usually localised, at or near the base of the leaf, at an earlier period than is the case
in the stem. Current morphology still retains those obvious distinetions of sheath,
petiole, and lamina, as coordinate structures, independently of the fact that the most,
salient and distinctive characters used in distinguishing these several parts one from
another result from processes of growth in transverse and longitudinal directions,
which, in the treatment of axes, would be freely admitted to be of bub secondary
importance, and certainly would nob be allowed to take precedence of those phenomena
of branching upon which the morphological treatment of the shoot is primarily based.
In the leaf precedence is given to the more obvious results of intercalary growth,
while the branching of the leaf is treated as of but secondary importance. This
inconsisteney demands further investigation. It must be ascertained by a comparative
study of the leaf in forms acknowledged to be lower in the scale, whether there be
