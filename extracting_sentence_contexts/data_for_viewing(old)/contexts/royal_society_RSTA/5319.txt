These and their corresponding datasets are referenced as fibres 1, 2 and 3 in the remainder of this
paper.

Fibre stock was purchased from California Fine Wire. The heat treatment of fibre 2 was in
vacuum at 320°C for 8h, followed by slow cooling in vacuum at about 30°C per hour. Figure 3
shows Q™! as a function of torsional amplitude, observed for these fibres when suspending the
pendulums used in our G measurement.

We have shown [4] that, in the framework of the model treated by Kuroda [1] and Quinn
et al. [2], fractional G error from anelasticity is, to order Q-1, bounded between 0 and 1/(2Q). In
this linear model, Q~! is independent of the torsional amplitude of a pendulum. In preparation
for our G measurement, we made extensive studies of torsion fibre properties at low temperature
[5,6], finding that in fact fibres made of CuBe, tungsten and A15056 all showed a large extremely
linear variation of Q-! with amplitude. The CuBe fibre most intensively studied exhibited
behaviour strikingly consistent with the following predictions [5,7] of a stick-slip model: (i) linear
dependence of Q~! on amplitude, (ii) linear dependence of torsional frequency w” on amplitude
(after subtracting a contribution from a third-order k30° elastic torque term, determined from
measurements of a sin(3wt) harmonic amplitude), (iii) a ratio (dQ-1/dA)/(dw?/dA) within
2% of the value —4/37w? predicted by the stick-slip model, and (iv) a characteristic pointy
‘Davidenkov’ [7] hysteresis loop close to that predicted by the model. The value of dQ-!/dA
was the same at 77K as at 4.2K, indicating temperature independence of this internal friction
component, whereas the zero-amplitude intercept of Q~1(A) increased by a factor of about 3.4
between 4.2 and 77 K. We established that the observed stick-slip behaviour was associated with
the fibre and not the epoxy used to mount it at its ends, by making measurements at 77 K with a
string of epoxy droplets along the fibre. Each such droplet should contribute the same amount to
