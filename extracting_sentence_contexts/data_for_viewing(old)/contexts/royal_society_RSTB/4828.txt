led MULLER to the assumption that the flow of blood within this vessel is to the rete,
whereas it is almost certainly the other way, from the rete to the lower lateral cutaneous
artery. For what Mier takes to bea single vessel is in fact twoâ€”(1) a trunk connected
at one end with the supra-hepatic rete and the pericardial artery (fig. 15, /.lat.cut.r.)
and at the other directly continuous with the lower lateral cutaneous artery; and
(2) a branch (the anastomosis) (fig. 10, an.) from the lateral cutaneous artery which
enters this trunk almost at right angles.

Are we then to consider the branch from the lateral cutaneous artery, or the trunk
from the rete, or both, to be the source of blood supply to the lower lateral cutaneous
artery ? Ifthe branch from the lateral cutaneous artery is the sole source of supply, blood
would flow along it not only to the lower lateral cutaneous artery, but (as MitieR
thought) to the supra-hepatic rete. Apart from the fact that the branch from the lateral
cutaneous artery may be absent (specimen C), the relative size of the various vessels
forbids this conclusion ; for the lower lateral cutaneous artery and the rete trunk taken
together are four times the diameter of the anastomosis with the lateral cutaneous artery,
and the latter obviously could not carry enough blood to supply both. We can thus
only conclude that the rete trunk is the main source of blood supply for the lower lateral
cutaneous artery, and is thus efferent from the supra-hepatic rete, and not, as supposed
by Miter, afferent to it.

How far the anastomotic branch from the lateral cutaneous artery is also a tributary
of the lower lateral cutaneous artery is not clear. The angle at which it meets the
trunk of the lower lateral cutaneous artery is compatible with the flow being from this
vessel, and the same conclusion is suggested by the fact that in specimen C this
