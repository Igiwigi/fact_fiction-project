larger difference than if one is pinnatifid, the other pinnatipartite.. We have not the
least idea whether the changes in internal construction of the nucleus necessary to
form Jordanian species are in any way different from, or smaller or larger than, those
necessary to give Linnean species.

The differences between many of the very rare endemic Ceylon species are large,
and these species are accepted as well-marked Linnean species by both Tromen and
Sir JosepH Hooker. Even in an endemic genus this is the case, as, for instance, in
Doona or Stemonoporus, where a great number of species are very rare, and only
represented by a few plants each. When we reflect upon the facts that have been
brought forward in this paper it is clear that we have no right to invoke extensive
killing out of intermediate forms.

It is a great deal more difficult to define the difference between a Linnean and a
Jordanian species than one is at first inclined to imagine.‚Äù In sucha plant as D. verna,
where the Linnean species is made by drawing a line round a number of forms at the
point of their greatest separation from allied forms, it is comparatively simple ; but
all the Linnean species are not like this, as we have just pointed out in the cases of
Doona and Stemonoporus.

The species in which Jordanian splitting can be applied are just such species as
D. verna, common species of wide distribution. This we have just seen to imply
