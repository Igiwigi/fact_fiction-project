It will be seen how much the Deflections are reduced by this hypothesis, especially
in the case where the attenuation extends through only 100 miles. In fact, in this case
the upheaval of the mountains and the consequent attenuation below produce a slight
deviation the other way at the two further stations. The snccess of the hypothesis may
therefore, thus far, be considered to be establiched, although it remains an hypothesis
Still; and we must always be in uncertainty, not as to its answering this end, but as to

its being true in nature. The existence of the mountain-mass is a fact indisputable.
Not 80 the compensating cause, which is simply conjectural as to its existence, and
altogether uncertain as to its extent, if it exist. We have no certain and independent
method of determining this; nor of ascertaining, even if the hypothesis be valid, how
far down the attenuation extends, or what law it follows.

14. 1 will now determine the effect of these several results upon the Ellipticity of the
Indian Arc.

The corrections to be applied to the astronomical amplitudes of the two arcs Kaliana
—Kalianpur and Kalianpur—Damargida, are determined by taking the differences of
the numbers in each line of the Deflections above given. Kence we get—
