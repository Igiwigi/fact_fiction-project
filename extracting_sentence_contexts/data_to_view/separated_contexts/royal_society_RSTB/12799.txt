This
implies that the results represent average worldwide trends. Importantly, the sets of control non-VIPs account for mul-
tiple key potential confounding factors (see Methods). Indeed,
VIPs and non-VIPs not only differ by the fact that VIPs interact
with viruses while non-VIPs either do not interact with viruses
or are not known to. In addition, VIPs and non-VIPs differ by
many other factors [8,11]. For instance, VIPs are more highly
constrained, more highly expressed than non-VIPs and have
more protein-protein interactions than non-VIPs [8,11].
