So far, but little
analytical work on serological lines has been done with plant viruses. A common
agglutinin has been demonstrated for all the X strains and shown to be present in at
least as great a quantity in X” as in any of the others. We shall probably not be wrong
in considering this antigen as the equivalent of the radicle A, supported as it is by the
fact that X”¥, X?, and X% all equally protect against YS and X¥. Bawden (1935)
showed that formalin destroyed the infectivity of the X virus strains but left the
flocculation intact, i.e. the radicle M is destroyed and A survives. He did not work
with X”, Spooner and Bawden (1935) demonstrated that when anti X° serum was
mixed with XS juice, 87 °% of the subsequent inoculations failed, but when mixed with
X® or X* juices 100 % failed. Again anti-X* serum when mixed with X¢ juice neutral-
ized 89 %,, and with X* 95 % of the plants, the dilution and procedure in all cases being
