As shown in figure 1, let the size of the black hole in the case where the
radioactive atom does not decay be equal to the radius r(t) of the event horizon #+, where t
labels a family of space-like hypersurfaces which intersect #*. Figure 1 shows a second null
surface lying at a radius râ€™(t) > r(t). If the radioactive atom decays at time f; then while for ft < fy
it appears that this null surface will escape to future null infinity, .%*, in fact after the object has
fallen into the black hole, increasing its mass, this null surface becomes trapped. The second null
surface can be assumed to correspond to the event horizon of the black hole in the case where the
atom decays. Hence at to < fy, the size of the black hole is bigger if the atom decays at f; than if


it does not.
