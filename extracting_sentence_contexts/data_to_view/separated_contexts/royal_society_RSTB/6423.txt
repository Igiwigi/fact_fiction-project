(1926, pp. 122, 123) has wrongly considered the four-chambered larger gonads as
those of the female and the single-chambered smaller ones as those of the male. He was led into this mistake on account of the presence of four ovarioles in the ovary
of L. pectiniceps, which he thought corresponded to the four lobes of the larger kind
of gonads of the larva, although a careful study of Lass’s description and diagrams
(1905, p. 85, pl. v, figs. 2, 3, 4) would have prevented him from making this serious
mistake. I have traced the post-embryonic development of the male gonads up to
the adult stage, and the quadrifollicular condition is retained in the adult, although
no worker has ever mentioned this fact before.

The female gonads—The ovarial rudiments are a pair of pyriform bodies which are
smaller than the testicular rudiments, being only 143 to 179 p» in the larger diameter. Each ovarial rudiment (fig. 59) is unichambered and is surrounded by a peritoneal
sheath (f.s.) in which extremely small nuclei are discernible. The peritoneal
sheath, at the time of division of the ovarial rudiment into ovarioles, becomes
inflected between the lobes.
