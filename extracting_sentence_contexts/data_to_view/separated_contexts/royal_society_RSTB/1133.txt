We have seen that
similar evidence in the case of the nerve fibres in the cord shows that in them also the
fect is propagated from the stimulated region indifferently either towards the centre
or the periphery, and it follows from the combination of these two, that if any fibres
p a nerve are directly continuous with those in the cord, the excitatory changes
following stimulation of these must be propagated along the whole length of the
continuous strand and may thus travel out into the fibres of the nerve. Direct
sontinuity has been shown to exist by the degeneration method between the
ibres of the posterior root and those of certain portions of the posterior
gymns, hence it is not surprising that the stimulation of the posterior columns in
Is cord should eause electrical changes in the posterior root due to the arrival in the

fSrent nerves, evoked by excitation of the columns in the spinal cord, are in

e natural direction, since it seems to be fundamental as regards nerve conduction
ligt fibres can conduct equally in either direction. he fact that in one group of nerve fibres (afferent) the starting platforms are at the
eFipheral end, and the receiving termini at the central, whilst in the other (efferent) the
eBitions are reversed, and that, in consequence, what are called normal nerve
nipulses proceed in the afferent direction in the one group and in the efferent in the

lism in any way) so as to make conduction in the one direction more difficult than in
he other. As far, then, as the directly continuous afferent fibres are concerned,
hgre i is no difficulty either in obtaining electrical results in the posterior roots on
saiting their direct prolongations in the cord, or in interpreting these as indicative
fSthe passage of nerve impulses.
