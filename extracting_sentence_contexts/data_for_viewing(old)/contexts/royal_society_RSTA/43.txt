decompositions and calculated correlations with the corresponding time-varying RSN degree
at all the resulting frequency sub-bands. Because the frequency sub-bands resulting from a
wavelet decomposition are the result of digital filtering and dyadic subsampling, they depend
on the sampling rate of the signal analysed. They were, therefore, different for PETCO2 and HR
because they were sampled at 1/3 and 4 Hz, respectively, as shown in figure 3. Lastly, it is worth
mentioning that the choice of basis function did not make a significant difference in our analysis.
The results presented were obtained by using the Coiflets wavelet basis [30] (figure 1).

(iv) Correlation coefficients

In each case, we quantified the modulating effect of time-varying physiological signal power
for both PETCO2 and HR on the time-varying RSN degree by calculating the Spearman rank
correlation coefficient, which is suitable in our case due to the fact that our results are paired with
respect to time (network degree versus time-varying physiological signal power). We performed
the analysis on all 12 subjects (11 for HR analysis, as one subject did not satisfy the SQI mentioned
above) and then calculated the mean and standard deviation of the resulting correlation
coefficients over all subjects. This was done both for the mask-based analysis (functional and
MNI space), seed-based analysis as well as for different wavelet sub-bands. Finally, statistical
significance for the computed correlation coefficients was assessed by calculating p-values for all
subjects, accounting for multiple comparisons by using Hommelâ€™s correction method [31].
