given choice of model parameters, which is consistent with that adopted in [28,29]. We compare
in figure 2 the plant’s tip trajectories as obtained for the four different growth models introduced
in §3, examples 1-4. We find that the occurrence of the mechanical instability does not depend
on the particular choice of the growth profile. Indeed, all the numerical simulations exhibit
the same qualitative behaviour. For subcritical lengths, the straight equilibrium is stable and
initial perturbations are damped. However, as the rod elongates, the trivial equilibrium suffers
an instability and initial perturbations lead to oscillatory dynamics that produce pendular or
circular patterns of increasing amplitude. This behaviour is vividly exemplified by the electronic
supplementary material, videos S1-S4. In particular, the impact of specific growth models upon
spontaneous oscillations is explored by setting the same initial length &9 = ¢g and overall linear
growth rate 1/tg, such that at any time the rods are equally long. We notice that for the linear
growth profile (example 3), spontaneous oscillations are delayed with respect to the other models
such that their amplitude is smaller. We argue that this derives from the fact that, for the linear
profile, the highest growth rate is at the rod’s tip, and hence the growth zone is effectively less
responsive than in the other cases, see equations (4.5). On the contrary, the other three models
(examples 1, 2, and 4) give rise to similar results, see figure 2a,b,d and electronic supplementary
material, videos 1, 2 and 4.

We extend our analysis by comparing the periods of the spontaneous oscillations that we
observe numerically at different stages of growth. This would correspond to limit cycles of a
dynamical system in which one freezes growth at the time of observation, in order to obtain a truly
