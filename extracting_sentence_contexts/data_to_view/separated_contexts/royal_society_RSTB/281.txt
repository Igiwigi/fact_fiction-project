158 PROFESSOR W. C. WILLIAMSON ON THE ORGANISATION

The exterior of the cortex of this plant was densely clothed with hairs. Though
longitudinal sections through the specimen described present a somewhat obscure
arrangement of tissues and organs, these hairs enable us to distinguish external
surfaces from internal structures. The difficulty of doing this is the greater since
two distinct stems are pressed closely together in the fragment of ganister in
which my specimens are preserved, and also from the fact that the innumerable
small cylindrical organs, d, variously intersected, and each with an ill preserved
vascular bundle in its interior, abound in all my preparations both within the cortex,
and externally to it, as at d,d. Similar structures appear to exist in M. Runautr’s
specimens of Anachoropteris, but that observer regards them as representing
petiolar bundles. Mine, like his, are ill preserved; but they more closely resemble
adventitious roots than petiolar structures. A similar one M. Renavuit himself
regards as a “racine adventif.”
