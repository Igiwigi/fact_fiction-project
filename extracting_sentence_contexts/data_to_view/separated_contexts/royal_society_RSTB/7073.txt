C. MAHALANOBIS ON LARGE-SCALE SAMPLE SURVEYS

32. It was found that in a large-scale survey the journey time was much greater than
enumeration time; in the jute survey of 1941 it was in fact three times larger. It was also
found that the journey time depended upon the number of grids per square mile (i.e. on
their distance apart) but was independent of the size (or area) of the individual grids,
Enumeration time, on the other hand, naturally increased with the size of grids, but was
independent of their density. Time required for miscellaneous work was more or less con-
stant and independent of both size and density of grids.
