time and space. Even at 1500 K, when the expected time between random jumps drops to 340 fs,
the most probable time between jumps drops to much lower than 100 fs.

The most probable distance between jumps are those starting from first nearest-neighbour
positions (INN) at 2.8 A. There are two possible scenarios that lead to INN jumps: (i) an Li*
jumps, leaving behind a vacancy, and its INN immediately jumps into the new vacancy location,
as shown by the black and grey arrows in figure 2b and (ii) two vacancies are close to one


another, such that INN Lit then jump into those separate vacancies (leaving the vacancies as
first nearest neighbours), as shown by the black and red arrows in figure 2. We know that in the
2 V;, simulation there is a high probability of finding vacancies as nearest neighbours (figure 3),
so the second scenario is possible, but the first scenario is far more likely. In fact, the electronic
supplementary material shows that with 1 V_,, there still exists a high probability of finding INN
subsequent jumps between 100 and 200 fs at 1100K, which can only be justified according to
the first scenario. We refer to these clusters of jumps in space and time as ‘hot zones’, where the
balance of enthalpy and entropy at a given temperature transfers to the entropic regime and many
jump events occur [56]. The s-Frenkel mechanism is also an example of an entropic ‘hot zone’.
The second evidence of correlated motion lies in the isolated high probabilities of jumps
occurring at Ar=4.9A (3NN) and At =225fs, and at Ar=6.3A (5NN) and At=200fs in the
2 Vj, 1100 K simulation. These isolated islands of higher probability are evidence of the hot
zone, where jumps are clustered in space and time. Note that there is no probability of jumps
at a distance of 4A until 375 fs, likely due to the low probability of finding Vi; at that distance

and the need to overcome a binding barrier for closely spaced vacancies (figure 2). Interestingly, : =
