The unfiltered input signal, u(Zw, t), is
shown at its near-wall position of z}, ~ 4.3, alongside a long-wavelength pass-filtered equivalent
with 4; > 7000. Per the kernel gain |H|, only the larger scales of the unfiltered input are included
in the stochastic estimate. In fact, the linear transfer kernel is an inherent scale filter since only
the scales that are coherent between the input (zw) and output (z) are included in the estimate,
while the incoherent scales cannot be estimated (|H| ~ 0 for these scales). For one outer-region
location, za ~ 464, we have shown a comparison of the estimated and measured fluctuations
(top of figure 4). Visual inspection reveals that the estimate captures the large-scale content of
the direct measurement reasonably well.
