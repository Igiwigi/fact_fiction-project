The conclusions follow by separately taking limits as Ki — oo and Ki — ov, respectively. a

Of course, the energy may have many critical points. A configuration of interest in this work is
the planar, azimuthal, spool-like configuration n = eg, which corresponds to g = 0. This solution
satisfies the boundary conditions, splay and twist constraints, and the Euler-Lagrange equations
for g (omitted), and thus, the question of whether this configuration has the least energy begs
to be addressed. In theorem 5.7, we show that it does indeed have the least energy among
configurations that we consider.

This result was anticipated due to the fact that the packing is at near-crystalline density,
which leaves little room for randomness in the configuration. Theoretical works done by
experimentalists, such as [11,16,44], assume this configuration without remark. In fact, in
theorem 5.7, we will demonstrate that even with weaker boundary information, as long as it
is satisfied by n = eg, the solution g = 0 will have lower energy than a non-constant minimizer 9”,
such that gj =0, when each is paired with a fixed free boundary p* that corresponds with g”*.


Theorem 5.7. The function ¢ =0 is the unique minimizer in Af for a given boundary function p*.
Moreover, for 0 <0 << K3,v, the minimizing profile corresponding to @ =0 is of the form

pg) = (Sesea +0 (z) . (6.21)

In particular, the spherical profile p() = 10, constant, is the minimizer only in the case K3 =0 =v.
