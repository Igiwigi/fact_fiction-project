thermal stability of lignin. The formation of volatiles during melt spinning of lignin is one of the a)
main challenges related to the melt spinning of lignin which can interrupt continuous spinning or : <
result in the formation of voids in the fibres. Heat treatment has been used as an effective method 3
for the devolatilization of lignin to reduce the volatiles and improve the spinnability of lignin [23]. 1S

For melt spinning, only the heat-treated sample is of interest. Its flow characteristic is shown in : Ss
figure 1. From experience and characterization of a multitude of spinning polymers, the complex :s
viscosity should be in a region of 100 Pas-500 Pas for a good processibility. This is reached for the [&

used lignin in a temperature region from 180°C to 187°C, which is a really small process window.
With regard to the fact, that a temperature deviation of 8°C was measured within industrial
spinning heads [56], this could lead to an uncontrollable viscosity profile from 500 Pas to 1700 Pas
(asm. 180°C is the highest temperature) to 25 Pas—100 Pas (asm. 187°C is the lowest temperature).
In the first case, due to the high viscosities, brittle fractures below the spinneret will occur. In the
second case, due to the low viscosities, the formation of droplets will occur [41].

The loss in possible spinnability can also be seen in the tan(5) behaviour. At an optimal
viscosity, it reaches 10, like for spinning polymer. For lower viscosities, it falls under 5 and
regarding possible temperature deviation even under 2, which means droplets instead of a
defined fibre formation.

To reach a lower diameter, lower viscosities are preferred, so that droplets are more critical
than brittle fractures. In this case, a spin carrier can support the fibre formation. In figure 2,
