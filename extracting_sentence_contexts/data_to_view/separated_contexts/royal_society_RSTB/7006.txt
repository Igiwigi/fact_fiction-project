In the meantime, in order to
discuss the functioning of this muscle system, I have numbered the muscles rather than
named them. Muscle 1 runs from the lateral sheet directly inwards and slightly downwards to attach
alongside the pleats and just above the point of attachment of the anterior section of the
dorsal longitudinal muscles. It is possible that it represents, in fact, the most ventral
constituent of this series. Muscle 2 similarly extends inwards, but slightly upwards,
to attach to the scutum. These two muscles clearly pull in the lateral prosomal walls
directly.
