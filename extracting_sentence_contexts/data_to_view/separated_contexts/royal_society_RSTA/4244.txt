This has been already mentioned as one of the requisite characters of a
satisfactory indicator. Imagine naturally slow Cu ions travelling behind naturally
faster K ions, with Cl ions travelling past both in the opposite direction. If Cu lag
behind K, or K run away from Cu, a region will be established where cations are
deficient, a state of affairs that must immediately correct itself by reason of the
consequent E.M.F. If, on the other hand, they keep pace with one another, as in
fact they do, it must be by virtue of a steeper potential slope in the blue. If now
some K ion accidentally lags behind its fellows, it will find itself in this region and
be at once hurried forward again ; while any ambitious Cu ion, trying to penetrate

* The precipitates formed across the tube by the meeting of Cu ions with CrO, ions and Fe(CN), ions
are of the nature of the semi-permeable membranes used by TRAUBE and PFEFFER in the study of
osmotic pressure.
