By a gentle heat 1,atom of
water may be separated ; and an oxalate of ammonia, as dry
as is compatible with its neutrality, remains,

I have analyzed, by the peroxide of copper, the citrate,
tartrate, and oxalate of lead ; and on comparing the results
thus obtained, with those derived from the analysis of the
crystalline acids, I have come to the above determinations,

Ferroprussic acid, the ferrocyanic acid of the French che-
mists, has proved, hitherto, a stumbling block to me, in re-
ducing the results of my experiments to the atomic theory. I
have subjected it to very numerous trials in many states of
combination, and have sought, with great pains, to-accommo-
date the results to the doctrine‚Äù of prime equivalents; but
hitherto without success. The following facts, however, may
perhaps be deemed of some consequence. In the first place, the prime equivalent of the crystallized
ferroprussiate of potash is 13-125, compared to oxide of -lead

of the former salt neutralize 20.75 of the latter.
