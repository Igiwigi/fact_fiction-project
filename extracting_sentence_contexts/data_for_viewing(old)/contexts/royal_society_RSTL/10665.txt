ABSORPTION SPECTRA OF THE ALKALOIDS. 515

Tb has been shown by the researches of Dr. C. R. A. Wren that the aconitines
all yield apo-derivatives with such facility that to obtain the bases free therefrom is
not an easy matter, and further they undergo saponification by acids and alkalies,
yery readily yielding an inert base in each case. Hence different preparations yield
different absorption curves. The aconitine and japaconitine of Dr. WrIGaT have
practically the same absorption spectrum and yield similar curves, bub that of
Japaconitine is jus what we might expect from a body with a nucleus of a similar
constitution but twice the molecular weight of aconitine, namely, a much greater
absorptive power. Tt has been shown that japaconitine has snch a difference, for it is
ain fact a 8esqui-apo-aconitine.*
S The English aconitine of Messrs. T. and: H. SmrTH and Co. appears to be a modified
form of japaconitine, and it is possible that the modification of the spectrum curve is
1 part due to an admixture of another body.
S Foreign aconitine is doubtless an entirely different snbstance, since it yields no
Sabsorption bands, and it is known to be comparatively inactive physiologically.
[2 On two separate occasions it was found necessary to estimate the strength of
nolutions of aconitine, and this was in each case successfully accomplished by taking a
Series of photographs and constructing a curve therefrom. That the results 80
Sobtained were correc was proved by a discovery of some migzing notes giving
Fartioular of the preparation of the solutions,
