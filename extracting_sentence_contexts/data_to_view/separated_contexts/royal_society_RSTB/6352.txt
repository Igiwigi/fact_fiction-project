For the proper understanding of the behaviour of the starfish, the nature of the
nervous reflexes must be established. An attempt has been made, in this paper, to
explain, as far as possible, some of the simpler reactions of the starfish on a morpho-
logical basis. ‘This has been made possible by the location of some of the motor
centres, more particularly the lateral motor nerves. The fact that only the simplest
reactions are at all explicable on this basis is sufficiently demonstrative of the limited
extent of our present knowledge of the asteroid nervous system. VITI—Summary

The foregoing account includes a description of the histology and distribution
of the nervous and non-nervous elements associated with the nervous system of the
starfish Marthasterias glacialts. As an introduction to the histology of the ectoneural sensory system, the radial
nerve cord has been studied in some detail.
