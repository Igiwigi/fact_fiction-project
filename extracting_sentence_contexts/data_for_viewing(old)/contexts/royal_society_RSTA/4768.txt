with a well-pronounced streamer ‘brush’ at the head of each channel. No increase of emission is
observed at the falling edge of the pulse; no emission is detected after the pulse. It is possible to
assume that the mechanism responsible for the filamentation can be different from the mechanism
responsible for the filamentation a few nanoseconds after the start of the pulse.

Figure 6 gives a review of the images of a nanosecond SDBD at elevated pressures. For all
considered pressures, in the absence of filamentation, a typical ‘optical radius’ R of the streamer
when images is taken in the direction perpendicular to the dielectric surface, is always higher
for a positive polarity discharge. Indeed, at voltage amplitude U = +46 kV for P=1,3 and 5atm,
R,=(14+0.2), 0.9 and 0.8mm, respectively, for positive polarity, and R- =1, 0.5 and 1.2mm
for negative polarity. The R— at 5atm is a distance between the filaments (figure 6 for 5atm
and —46 kV), the distance between the initial streamers being approximately four times smaller.
Let us note that this fact does not correlate with a streamer in the air gap, where the diameter
of a streamer of negative polarity is always higher [24], but does correlate with the smaller
‘near-surface’ gap between the streamer of the negative polarity and the surface in numerical
modelling [14].

Transition to filamentary regime, if it exists in the combustible mixtures, can be extremely
important for redistribution of energy in the discharge. At the same time, the physics of this
transition is not yet clear. Figure 7a presents the so-called x — ¢ diagram (position of a streamer
head as a function of time) for regimes where streamer-to-filament transition in a single pulse
has been observed. After the transition, filaments propagate with a constant velocity, close to
1mmns“!, for a distance of tens of millimetres. The transition point, where streamers slow down
and stop, is indicated in the figure as ‘filamentation’.
