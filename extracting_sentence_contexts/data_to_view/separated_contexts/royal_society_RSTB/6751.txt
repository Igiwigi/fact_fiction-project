Prediction in regard to future
events in Montserrat and the Lesser Antilles is made very difficult by the almost
complete lack of continuous scientific records of past soufriére activity and local earth-
quake shocks, and by the vagueness of many of the accounts of isolated disturbances. We even lack such elementary data as the number and location of active and extinct
soufriéres. Seismo-volcanic phenomena were in fact largely ignored until 1902. To a
large extent they are still disregarded unless attention is called to them by alarming
events. From the facts at our disposal, however, there are important conclusions to be
drawn.
