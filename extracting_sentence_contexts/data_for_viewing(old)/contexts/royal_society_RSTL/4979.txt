ridia is 255th of an inch.

There is another species of Conzothecium almost as common as the last, known by
the name of Coniothecium betulinum, and which is to be found upon twigs and small
branches of Birch. Tt bears a strong resemblance to Coniothecium Amentacearum, and
Thavye some grounds for supposing that, like that species, it is a conidioid form of fruit
of a Sphezeria (Spharia lanciformis) which is not uncommon in this country upon Birch.
T have not yet been able to prove satisfactorily the connexion between the two, but
further observation may poxsibly establish it.

In the plants above described, the two forms of fruit, assuming them to arise from
the same mycelium, must be consider2d as essentially distinct, that is, the secondary
form has no further connexion with the normal fructification, than the fact of being

produced upon the same mycelium ; but other cases occur in which the normal form of
fruit is 80 far modified and altered by external circumstances, as to appear at first 8ght
as if belonging to a different species or even genus.

It is an opinion rapidly gaining ground, that by far the greater number of the plants
composing the genera Diplodia, Sporocadus, Spharopsis, Hendersonia, Phoma and others,
