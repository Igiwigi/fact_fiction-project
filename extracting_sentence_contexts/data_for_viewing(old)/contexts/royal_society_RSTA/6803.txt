by a shearing action S in excess of S,, remains flat. This result too was to be expected
(cf. §18).

43. We have seen that the governing equations, and hence the wanted (equilibrium)
configuration, can be deduced from (87), which in § 42 was obtained from a general
theorem in Mechanics. But (87) also expresses the statement that S as deduced from

1,+4,4+S8], = 0, (90)

is stationary for all permissible variations; so the wanted configuration can be deduced from a
principle akin to Rayleigh’ s.

It is not the fact that satisfaction of the governing equations implies the satisfaction
of (90),—i.e., according to (83), the evanescence of ¥: we have seen that ¥<0 in
the wanted configuration. This circumstance, however, does not invalidate the use in
computation of the principle stated in italics. Exactly similar conclusions were reached
(§ 20) in relation to Example 2.

44. Following our treatment of that example, we may say that in the wanted
configuration yz as deduced from

L4+h4+4;=0 (91)

is stationary, and that S=,pz-L/I,, (92)
