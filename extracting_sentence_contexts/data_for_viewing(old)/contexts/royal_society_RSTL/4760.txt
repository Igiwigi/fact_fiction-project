the places have eastern declination, the one that is south
will be soonest affected, and for the time most strongly,
but will in a period more or less extended, be followed
by the corresponding action at the other place. For as
each needle will have returned from the first half of its
series of changes to 0* by the time the sun is on its mag-
netic meridian, and as it will arrive at this meridian, as
regards the south needle, before it does s0 for the north
needle, 80 the 8outh magnet should precede the other in
its changes. If the declination of both were westerly,
then the north needle would precede the south. $

2943. The hypothesis advanced, besides agreeing with the facts regarding the
direction of the needle's motions, as is the case generally, and if my hopes are well-
founded, will be the case also in more careful comparisons ; should also agree in the
amount of force required for the observed declinations at given hours. I have
endeavoured to obtain experimental evidence of the difference of action of oxygen
and nitrogen on needles subjected to the earth's power, but baye not yet succeeded.
This however is not surprising, since a saturated solution of protosulphate of iron
has failed under the same circumstances. More delicate apparatus may perhaps
yield a positive result.

2944. That small masses of oxygen should not give an indication of that which is
shown by the atmosphere as a whole is not surprising, if we consider that the mass
of air is exceeding great, and includes a vast extent of the curves on which it, by the
