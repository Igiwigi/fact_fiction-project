1. Introduction

A plethora of studies using a large variety of methodological approaches in
animal models and humans have clearly demonstrated that memory is not a
unitary process. On the one hand, declarative memory is defined as our
Julien Doyon capacity to acquire and recollect facts and events. It is known to depend primar-

particular (see [1,2], for reviews). On the other hand, procedural memory is
described as our ability to acquire a variety of skills, including simple and com-
plex motor skill behaviours such as shoe lacing or playing a musical
instrument, respectively. To study this type of procedural memory, researchers
have used a variety of motor sequence learning (MSL) paradigms which test the
process by which discrete, independent actions become unified and performed
effortlessly as a unitary sequence through repeated practice (see [3,4], for
reviews). Changes in performance seen during the acquisition of such skills
are known to be incremental, implicit in nature, long lasting and dependent
upon anatomical and functional plasticity within motor-related brain struc-
tures, including the striatum, cerebellum, motor-related cortical regions, as
