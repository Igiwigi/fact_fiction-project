In 1697 he published in Philosophical Transactions—in Latin—an elaborate
demonstration of Leibniz’ result [29]. Unfortunately, he gave an erroneous derivation of the
correct differential equation. Gregory’s major error lay in his failure to appreciate that it is the
difference between tensions on each end of a small element of chain which balances its gravity:
as Truesdell [23] remarks, this is ‘one more example to show that the local balance of forces,
which we are all taught to regard as the simplest approach to the mechanics of continuous
media, is in fact not an obvious concept’. But once he has stated the correct equation, Gregory
goes on to prove all of Leibniz’ results competently. Gregory’s paper was reprinted in Acta,
July 1698.
