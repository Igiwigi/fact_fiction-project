But in some experiments spaces of more
than this minimum are were provided for certain primordia—for instance for I, in the
experiments in which only I,k arose. The question therefore arises whether in such
circumstances a primordium is determined over the whole of the available arc, as soon
as it becomes far enough below the growing-point, or whether it is first determined over
the minimum arc only, so that it can only occupy the rest by subsequent extension. The second alternative is favoured by the facts concerning I, discussed on pp. 378, 379,
though more evidence is needed. In the normal plant the leaves continue to extend laterally for several plastochrons
after they have arisen, as was shown in section 2, and by the beginning of the P, stage
they have already considerably exceeded the minimum arc of 124°. But the later
stages of this extension must take place through tissues that become available only
after the leaf has been determined, through the growth in length of the apex and axis,
which makes new tissue available above and between the older leaves.
