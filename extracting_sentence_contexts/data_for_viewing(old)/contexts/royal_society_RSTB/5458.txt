laterally to basal cartilage medially ; whereas the mammalian membrane covering the
fenestra rotunda stretches from capsular cartilage to capsular cartilage (the processus
recessus). ‘This opinion is erroneous, and I agree with Rice (1920, p. 152) in regarding
the secondary tympanic membranes of reptiles and‘mammals as homologous, although
in the mammal the membrane is reduced owing to the formation of cartilage (processus
recessus) in the remainder of the floor of the recessus scale tympani.

Gaupr was therefore wrong both in deriving the fenestra rotunda from the foramen
perilymphaticum and in denying the homology of the reptilian with the mammalian
secondary tympanic membrane. It is doubtful whether he would have fallen into
these associated errors if he had realised that the recessus scale tympani, which is
extracapsular in reptiles, is intracapsular in mammals. This is all the more
remarkable because he definitely referred (1900, p. 514) to the fact that the
perilymphatic sac in the mammal is confined to the auditory capsule and cranial cavity,
whereas in the reptile the perilymphatic sac emerges from the auditory capsule into
the recessus scale tympani before communicating with the cranial cavity.

Attention may here be called to what I believe to be a mistake in Fiscumr’s text-fig. 1
(1903, p. 394). FiscuEer describes the processus recessus (not given a special name by
him) and states that the fenestra rotunda is covered by a dense membrane. The
figure, however, shows a membrane covering not the fenestra rotunda but the original
