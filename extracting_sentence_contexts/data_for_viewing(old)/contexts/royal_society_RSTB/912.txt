organisms do not possess this discriminating value. It may be that if a sufficient
large number of micro-organisms were taken, they could be placed in a series
mencing with those which acted towards the cells like indifferent particles,
ingested by the hyaline cells and unnoticed by the eosinophile cells, and ending w
those like B. anthracis or filamentosus, which provokes the most profound activity (
the eosinophile cell while the hyaline cell is incapable of attacking them. Bearing i
mind the complex conditions of the conflict, we are forced to conclude that th
organisms against which the Frog is not immune may be found either at one end
at the other end of the series, or at both.

Yeast, in its most virulent form, represents to a certain extent the middle of
series. Clusters of yeast cells are attacked by the eosinophile cells, just as ar
anthrax chains, aud to these come hyaline cells; in fact, the story is the same
that which has already been related. At the same time hyaline cells will inge
stray yeast cells which have not been attacked by eosinophile cells. The notes ¢

one experiment will illustrate this.

Experiment VII.

Bouillon yeast culture of great virulence when tested on Rabbits. Inoculated lymph drop with thi
Frogs completely unharmed by large doses of this yeast.
1 o’clock,—Watched large mass of yeast. Three eosinophile cells came up and were lost in north en

of mass.
