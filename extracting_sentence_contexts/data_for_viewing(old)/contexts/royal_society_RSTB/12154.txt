can be partly ascribed to the reliance of animal brains on
faster voltage-gated ion channels, such as those dependent
on sodium, which evolved only when rapid responses were
increasingly beneficial (due for instance to the appearance of
predators) [27]. Nevertheless, slow propagation of electrical
activity is still present in modern animal brains. During the
phenomenon of cortical spreading depression, for instance, a
slow wave of electrical activity propagates over brain tissue,
with massive ionic redistribution involving, critically, potass-
ium and glutamate accompanied by a strong metabolic
disturbance. This phenomenon has been regarded as intrinsic
to neurons and is evolutionarily conserved across animal
species [10]. In the light of these facts, it is tempting to see
the potassium-mediated transmission of stress among bac-
terial cells as a precursor of more recent electrically-mediated
information propagation tasks in animal brains. The study of
membrane potential dynamics and electrical signalling pro-
cesses in other bacterial species will be important to further
illuminate this issue.
