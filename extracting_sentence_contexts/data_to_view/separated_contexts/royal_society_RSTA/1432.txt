As a
result, manufacturers had little incentive to sell software separately from hardware. They also had
no incentive to prevent software from being shared widely. In fact, the widespread distribution
of programs for a specific model often led to user-contributed updates, which improved sale
prospects for that model ([32], p. 5). This dynamic affected early corporate motivations for
investment in software development. It also affected how companies distributed source code,
and the relationship they kept with volunteer developers (e.g. users in academia operating the
hardware, typically researchers and technicians).
