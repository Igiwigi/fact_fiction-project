Small resolution runs N < 256 started from random initial data and were evolved until a

statistically steady state is reached where all quantities fluctuate around a mean value and the

energy injection is balanced by the energy dissipation. Larger resolution runs N > 512 started

with initial conditions obtained from smaller resolution runs extrapolated to the new grid. They

were then evolved until a statistically steady state is reached.

A table of the parameters of our runs is given in table 1. Let us also stress that simulations
with values of A on the other side of the transition A < 4, are hindered from the fact that in such a
range one would need to fully resolve also the inverse energy cascade range and this is by far too
demanding for the scopes of this work.

(a) Energy balance relations

Figure 1 shows the time evolution of the total energy, â‚¬, for the smallest value of Ree = 500
examined and for different values of 4. As the value of 4 approaches its critical value 4, ~ 0.3 the
mean (time averaged) energy is increased, as also are the fluctuations around the mean value. This
behaviour could in part be anticipated since by taking the limit 4 > 4, we reduce the efficiency
of the flow to transport energy to the small scales so the amplitude of the turbulent fluctuations
