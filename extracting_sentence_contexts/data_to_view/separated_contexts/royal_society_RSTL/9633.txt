from top to
bottom. Near the apex of the cochlea the scala vestibuli communicates with the
scala tympani by means of an oval opening—helicotrema—formed by the absence of
the bony lamina, which does not extend as far forward as the apex of the cochlea
(see Plate 45, fig. 1). The scala tympani is throughout much smaller than the scala vestibuli, and this is
due to the fact that the osseous lamina encroaches much further inwards on its lower
than on its upper 8ide. The scala tympani is nearly circular in section, and varies
very slightly in diameter, {5 inch or 56 millim. throughout its entire length.
