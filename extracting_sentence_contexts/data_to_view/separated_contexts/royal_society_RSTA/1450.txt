Lewis again. We argue that such a dual trend applies to the DIKW chain as well, at least to the two lower
layers: too much data is just like no data all. In fact, this is possibly still more general: in a finite
world, close to capacity, competitive interactions arise which either annihilate the return on
investment (information per data unit) or even make it negative, thereby destroying information
and productivity, over-communication being a well-known example in point.‚Äù

Of course one can argue that, in actual practice, this depends on where the capacity is, so that

BD can move it upwards and shift the problem away. We maintain that such threshold shifting : =
without due insight is purely chimeric. Unless we can apprehend the logical structures underlying : =
any given phenomenon, we may just keep generating data conflicts that data accumulation alone 1B
will not be able to resolve: in fact, quite the opposite. :2
In science, we strive to go from data-starved to data-rich, yet a blind data-driven procedure, 8

as often advocated by the most enthusiastic BD neophytes, may well take us from data-rich to : o
data-buried science, unless a just dose of theoretical reasoning is used as an antidote [11]. in
More importantly, we all live in a finite world, and sooner or later its finite capacity is going to : =
