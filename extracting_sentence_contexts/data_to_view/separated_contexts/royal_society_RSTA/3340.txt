Thus Freiburg is the highest and Wolfenbiittel the lowest. The absolute maxima
(between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.) are Wolfenbiittel 64, Freiburg 420, Karasjok 384, i.e.,
the same order as before. It is a strange fact that the yearly period should be so marked in Karasjok, while
no yearly period can be detected in either Wolfenbiittel or Freiburg. As stated
above, neither Etster and Gerret nor GockEL have observed after 8 P.M., so it is
impossible to compare the daily periods. It would be exceedingly interesting to
know if there is a large daily variation in mid-Europe, for if there is not, then the
mean winter value of the radio-activity in Karasjok will be very high compared with
mid-Europe, the mean for the winter, when night as well as day observations are
taken into account, being 126 at Karasjok.
