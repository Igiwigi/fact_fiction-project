the question must be taken up afresh and treated in another manner.

10. I hope some mathematician will be found able and willing to execute this task.
But in the mean time I may be permitted to observe, that what has been already done
in the discussion of tide observations, and in bringing to light the empirical laws of
the phenomena, has entirely altered the position of this branch of science with respect
to the mathematical theory. A little while ago the theory was in advance of obser-
vation ; at present observation is in advance of theory. A very few years since, the
equilibrium-theory and the Laplacian theory were in a condition to assign laws regu-
lating the changes of the times and heights under given astronomical circumstances,
and it had not been shown from observation whether these laws were obeyed. We
can now state what the agreement and disagreement is between such theoretical laws
and the facts; and we call upon the mathematician to substitute for these two theo-
ries, both confessedly false, some other, which shall come nearer to the true state of
the case, and, by that means, nearer to the laws of the phenomena. The performance
of this task is requisite for the completion of the Newtonian theory of the universe.

I 2. On the Effect of the Moon's Declination on the Tides at Liverpool.

11. In order to obtain the Solar Inequality, it was necessary to eliminate the effect
of the variations of the lunar tidal forces ; the results of the two sets of forces being
combined in the tides when tabulated according to months, as is done in Mr. Lus-

* While I write this, I am informed by Mr. Buxr that he has obtained the law of the solar inequality of the
times at Bristol. The agreement with my rexults is very remarkable.
