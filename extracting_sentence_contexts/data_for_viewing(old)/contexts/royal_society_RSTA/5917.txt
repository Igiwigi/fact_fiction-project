with a #c indicating there is a discontinuity at p,. We will come back to this point later in the last
section. The data for a and o are plotted in figure 6 for which the above forms have been obtained.

The qualitative behaviour discussed above is again true for both the schemes but the values of
the parameters differ for the two schemes. We observe that the walk for Scheme II takes place in
a more zig-zag manner such that the net displacement is larger for Scheme I. The precise values
of the parameters occurring in equation (3.2) and (3.3) are given in table 2.

We try to justify next why the two schemes give almost identical results for the exponents j1,
v and 8. (y is different for the two walks but it is actually not a critical exponent). The fact is, as
table 1 shows, the difference in the two schemes occurs only when the opinion state changes from
