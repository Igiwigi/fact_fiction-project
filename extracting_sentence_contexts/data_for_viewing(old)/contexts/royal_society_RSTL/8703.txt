at the same time change 7 into mt, the integral becomes

5 PS ole CE LHm(t+f) —2 +) dt—term in :;
and hence writing mf=f+3f or m=1 +, and therefore m?=1 +22, the value is

Hence the term in If is

=df into expression A es ah TE F: ETI(t+f?—2) (+94,

where the factor which multiplies If is, as it should be, the ring-integral ; it in fact
agrees with one of the expressions previously obtained for this integral.

and reducing in like manner, the term in { þ may be expressed in the four forms
