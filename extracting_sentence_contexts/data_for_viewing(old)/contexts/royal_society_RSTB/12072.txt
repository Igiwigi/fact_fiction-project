cerns the sufficient sample size [7]. An example of this is the practical ‘rule of
three’ [8,9]. It gives the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of
the incidence when all of the N sampled hosts are assessed as healthy: Qo; =
3/(N + 1). Estimating disease incidence (denoted q hereafter), or proving its
absence, is of most interest during the early stages of epidemics, i.e. when
incidences are low and containment measures are still promising.

Simple practices like the ‘rule of three’ make the assumption that the
samples are independent binomial draws with probability q and size N. How-
