Fig. 25, Plate 6, from a median longitudinal
section through the leafy stem, shows clearly a sieve-tube (iph) abutting on the one
side wpon a xylem strand and on the other upon the pith (p). It is not possible to
assert definitely that the phloem on the inner face of each xylem strand forms a
complete and unbroken layer. In fact, sections have been met with in which pith-like
cells were seen directly in contact with the xylem ; but such cases are not common. The number of stelar bundles is smaller than in 7'm. Vieillardi, a fact evidently related
to the less crowded leaves.
