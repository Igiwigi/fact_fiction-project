A clearly defined ridge occupies the
middle line of some of the pinnz where the carbonised film has been removed. The
apices of the pinnze, seen in other specimens, are acutely pointed. Cuticular membranes
did not add any facts to those published by Naruorst. The specimen shown in fig. 64
is probably a piece of a young frond in which the pinne are contiguous and more or less
imbricate.
