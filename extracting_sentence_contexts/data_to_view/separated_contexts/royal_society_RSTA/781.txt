No attempt has been made to illustrate the
differing intensities of the branches on the diagram. The combination relations which
give certain term differences in the initial and final states can be read off from the heads
of the columns in Tables XIII-XIX. Owing to the fact that alternate lines are missing
in each branch only alternate values of these differences can be derived from the analysis. ANALYSIS OF THE BANDS

The appearance of the bands under high dispersion can be seen from Plates 7, 8,
which show an enlargement of part of the (0, 0) band. Examination of the spectrum
on large-scale enlargements showed that of the two branches found by Frerichs, each
