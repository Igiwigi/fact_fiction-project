All that can
be expected from one 0 circumstanced is to give a general
outline, leaving the minuter parts to be filled up by those who
have more leisure, but by no means more zeal, for studies of
this kind. As these materials are collected not merely for the present
investigation, but are intended for the use of future enquirers,


of graminivorous and carnivorous Animals. 14r;

care has been taken that every. anatomical fact brought
forward, should be ascertained by actual examination,

It is proposed to describe the internal structure of such sto-
machs as appear to form the principal links in, the grada-
tion between animals which ruminate, and those which, are
truly carnivorous, arranging them in a series, the beginning of
which is that nearest allied to the stomach of the ruminant,
in the complexity ofits parts, and the termination, that, which
is most simple in its internal structure. Before the appearances of these different $tomachs are de-
scribed, it will be necessary to explain the circumstances under
which they were observed. As the object of the present enquiry
is to determine with as much accuracy as possible the. shape,
the stomach puts on, while performing its functions in_the
living body, and the structure, which belongs to the different
parts of its internal membrane, it became necessary to consider
what would be the best mode of making such examinations.
