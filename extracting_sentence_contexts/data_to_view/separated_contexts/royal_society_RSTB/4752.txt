behind the scapula to the level of the pelvic fins, assume
a very peculiar character. Within this area the deep branches form a close-set series
of short trunks, not more than 1 mm. in length, each terminating in a brush of fine
parallel twigs that run directly inwards between the bundles of the trunk muscles
towards the vertebral column. The components of the arterial brushes are unbranched except towards their final
distribution, and lie close side by side, interspersed with corresponding bundles of fine
parallel veins, the whole forming a simple rete, differing from those of MiLLERâ€™s unipolar
type only in the fact that the individual twigs do not anastomose to form a true plexus. The vessels that form the arterial component of this rete are of approximately the
same size (Plate 9, fig. 5), and retain their diameter for a very considerable distance
towards the vertebral column. In structure (Plate 10, fig. 6) they resemble other arteries of small size, but show an
unusually strong and complete elastica interna.
