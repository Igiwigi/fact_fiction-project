Convergence of the Series. In default of a proof that the formal power series (5.13) giving the general solution of
the equations (5.1) are convergent, the investigation of §§ 5-9 is of only formal validity. In point of fact the series (5.13) are in general divergent, but the arguments by which this
may be proved are of an indirect nature.* A new line of attack is therefore needed to
prove the convergence of the series giving the formally periodic solutions. ‘The procedure
is to give a process for the direct construction of these solutions, and then to prove that
the series involved are convergent by the method of “ dominant series.”
