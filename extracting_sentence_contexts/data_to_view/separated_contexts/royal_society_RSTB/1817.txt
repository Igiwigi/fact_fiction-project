Geol. Landesanstalt,â€™ Neue Folge, part 23). The variety of structure of fern petioles there
described is considerable ; it is reasonable to suppose that this variety of vegetative
structure was accompanied by variety of the sorus, and it should at least be a
warning against generalisation in such a case as this from few facts. It is quite
possible that the differentiation both of synangial sori, and of those with separate
sporangia, either grouped in sori or solitary, may have been of much earlier date than
those used as the basis of his argument by Srur. Another consideration will make the conclusion of Srur seem questionable ;
perhaps no feature in the Marattiacese is more remarkable than the persistence of
type from the remote past to the present day.
