Because the
steady states are equilibrium solutions, deterministic transitions between
solution branches for an evolving freshwater forcing u(t) will generally occur
somewhat beyond the bifurcation point; that is, there will be a slight overshoot
(e.g. Berglund & Gentz 2006). The fact that three-dimensional coupled oceanâ€”
atmosphere models produce analogous hysteresis structures (e.g. Weaver &
Hughes 1994; Rahmstorf et al. 2005; Kuhlbrodt et al. 2007) suggests that this
AMOC model captures the essential physics of the advective feedback bistability
(although its predictions cannot be expected to be quantitatively meaningful). In the absence of climate noise, the AMOC regime transitions can only occur if
u is moved beyond one of the fold bifurcations.
