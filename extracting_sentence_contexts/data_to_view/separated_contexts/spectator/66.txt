Steele gave only two lines to it:

    With dread concern, the awful Senate came,
    Their grief, as all their passions, is the same. The next Assembly dissipates our fears,
    The stately, mourning throng of British Peers. A factious intemperance then characterized debates of the Commons, while the House of Lords stood in the front of the Revolution, and secured the permanency of its best issues. Steele describes, as they pass, Ormond, Somers, Villars, who leads the horse of the dead queen, that 'heaves into big sighs when he would neigh' — the verse has in it crudity as well as warmth of youth — and then follow the funeral chariot, the jewelled mourners, and the ladies of the court,

    Their clouded beauties speak man's gaudy strife,
    The glittering miseries of human life. I yet see, Steele adds, this queen passing to her coronation in the place whither she now is carried to her grave.
