Sulphate of magnesia had also been
taken by this patient, 80 that the amount of sulphates is partly owing to the medi-
cine; but that this is not the sole or chief canse of the increase is proved by the fact
that many of the patients with other diseases took the same quantity of sulphate of
magnesia, but the sulphates in the urine were never increased to the same amount. The phosphates, in seven out of the nine cases of delirium tremens, were below the
average. The same fact was stated in my previous paper, but from the diminution

of the phosphates in acute chorea, it becomes doubtful how far this result is owing
to the action of alcohol in the system. Further experiments are required ; meanwhile excessive abstinence from food must
be admitted as a cause of the diminution of the phosphates in the urine, provided
there is no inflammatory action of the nervous structures. In a case of restless excitement leading to self-destruction, the sulphates in the
urine were found to be increased, and the same thing was also observed with a dimi-
nution of the phosphates in a case of delirium and phthisis.
