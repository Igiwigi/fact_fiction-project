Ophthalmidium carinatum was described as common from the opalinus zone (uppermost
Lias or Lowest Bajocian) of Schambelen, Canton Aargau, Switzerland.

Genus Bullopora Quenstedt, 1858

Cushman (1933, p. 192) considered Vitriwebbina Chapman, 1892 to be a synonym of
Bullopora. But if Chapman is correct in stating that Vitriwebbina has a finely perforate
wall, with a polymorphine initial stage, then it is certainly distinct.

Bullopora, on the contrary, has a coiled initial stage followed by a linear series of
chambers; there is a simple, terminal aperture, and the wall is calcareous, and appears
to be imperforate. This, in fact, seems to be the form described by Cushman in 1929 as
Nubeculinella, which thus becomes a synonym of Bullopora.

In B. rostrata the chambers are aludel-shaped, strongly recalling those of Ophthal-
midium, and suggesting that it is really just an Ophthalmidium that has become attached
and uncoiled. Its systematic position is clearly in the family Ophthalmidiidae, sub-
family Nubeculariinae.
