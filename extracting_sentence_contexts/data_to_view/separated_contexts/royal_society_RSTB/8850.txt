The deafferentation and reafferentation
observations demonstrate that afferent nerves carry codes
that produce extensive structural and functional changes in
the postsynaptic neuron. Some of these codes may be electri-
cal, but others may be molecular. Results from cell biology
studies reveal that exosomes do in fact transport and deliver
across synapses precisely the type of molecule necessary to
carry such a molecular code. This would seem to be an unli-
