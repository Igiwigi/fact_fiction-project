This fact is sustained by another fact, viz. that in Nats and Lumbricus neither the ova
nor the sperm-cells have ever, under any circumstances, been discoyered in the general
cavity of the body. On these and other grounds it is then probable that the augmented
size of the ciliated tubes in the © generative region ” may be ascribed to two causes: 1st, to
the fact that they are the roots from which the ovarian and testicular masses arise; and,
2nd, that by means of their open ciliated ends, they may effect the discharge of a larger
quantity of the cavitary fluid from the segments in which they are situated ; and the more
rapid elimination of this fluid from this region is most probably concerned in the more
energetic nutrition characteristic of the generative segments®. Hirudinei.—The segmental organ in the Leech tribe exists under very readily demon-
strated conditions. Two genera of this family will be here selected for the purposes of
illustration, viz.
