From these and other experiments, he concluded © that a

fresh egg has the power of resisting heat, cold and putrefaction in a degree equal to
5 many of the more imperfect animals ;” and he adds, © it is more than probable this
power arises from the same principle [4.e. a living principle] in both*.” Mr. Hux-
= TER'S Pupils generally adopted this conclusion : and the facts on which it was based
Z have formed a chief part of the evidence for the existence of a special vital principle
2 capable of resisting, by a kind of passive opposition, the changes that physical forces

3 produce in dead organic matter. In the course of some inquiries into the nature of the life of the blood, I repeated
: and extended Mr. HuxTeR's experiments, and obtained results which, I venture to
hope, may be deemed worthy of the consideration of the Society. My experiments consisted chiefly in submitting to temperatures near to zero of
Faurgxnerr, fowls' eggs, into which thermometers with slender bulbs were intro-
duced.
