The remaining ascents, which amount to 124, have been arranged thus :—

Group I. Sea-level pressure under 741 mm. (29°17 in.).

The numbers for each group are 6, 12, 15, 30, 41, 20 respectively, so that, excepting
for the group under 741 mm., there are quite enough observations to form a good
mean. But a difficulty occurs from the fact that the low pressures are concen-
trated into the winter months, for extreme values in North-Western Europe
only occur in the winter, and no number of observations can cure this. It is
therefore absolutely necessary, if we wish to compare the temperature conditions that

prevail in cyclones and anticyclones, to allow for the annual temperature variation,
and this has been done by means of Table III. It is true that Table IIL. itself
depends on Table VIL, and therefore Table VII. ought not to be indebted in any way
to Table III. The corrections might be applied by means of Table I. instead of IIL,
but the method of continued approximation seems the more suitable notwithstanding
