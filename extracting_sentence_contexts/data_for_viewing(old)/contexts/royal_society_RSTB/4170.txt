Determination of Water Equivalent of Kata-Thermometer,

We have emphasised the desirability of expressing rate of cooling in heat unit rather
than as “ velocity” of cooling or rate of loss of temperature. In order to do this it
became necessary to determine the. water equivalents of the kata-thermometers that
were employed. This in itself proved to be no easy matter though the difficulties were
eventually completely overcome. It was recognised at the outset that the water
equivalent of such an instrument is a variable quantity on account of gradual accumu-
lation of more liquid in the bulb on cooling and an uncertain amount of leakage of heat
by conduction along the stem. These and other considerations coupled with the fact
2 that rates of cooling were calculated at a certain fixed temperature, namely 36°°5 C.,
6 imposed on any method adopted the condition that the water equivalent should be
3 determined while the column of liquid was in the neighbourhood of the 100 division
5 on the stem. Two methods were used for this purpose.

3) Method I.—This was the ordinary electro-calorimetrie method. The kata-thermo-
4 meter bulb was immersed in water in a copper calorimeter which was enclosed in a
