This range of alloys is not permanently transformed, the original tensile
properties being restored unaltered on return to normal temperature. with no change
in the specific magnetism or dimensions. Finally, among the curious facts noted was that for all those alloys containing nickel,
whose ductility was undiminished or even increased in liquid air, the reduction in area
at the fracture was appreciably diminished, as an average by about 50%. Thus, while
maintaining the extent of their total elongation before fracture, these alloys do so with
a distinct change in behaviour; that is, through a more uniform extension along the
length of the test specimen, and less localized in the neighbourhood where fracture
oceurs. With these interesting facts on record regarding the behaviour of iron and ferrous
alloys at a temperature of — 182° C., it was a natural desire to explore, when oppor-
tunity occurred, still lower down the temperature scale.
