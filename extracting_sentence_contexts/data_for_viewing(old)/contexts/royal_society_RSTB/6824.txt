one, for X° is represented (fig. 47, p. 209), as possessing both M and N radicles,
whilst X% (fig. 47), possesses only N, and X“ only M. It might be thought that as 1 pro-
duces a more virulent and destructive effect on tobacco, and even more so on potato,
than does X°, that it is illogical to suppose that X° is equipped with both M and N, and
X% with N alone. There are, however, arguments of weight in favour of such a view.
It has been shown that it is generally possible to extract a mottle form such as X¢ from
an X% infected plant, and that such forms have not infrequently arisen as mutations;
further, that XS on most potatoes produces a mottle only, all of which point to the
presence of the M radicle. On the other hand, all attempts to extract a mottle form
from X” infected plants by selective inoculation have failed, which is to be expected if
the M radicle is absent. As regards the greater virulence of the XY compared with
the X®% strain which is furnished with both the M and N radicle, this is in fact what
should be expected.

It has been shown that the resultant effect on the host plant of a mixture of two
strains, one of greater and one of lesser virulence, is not a summation of virulences but a
dilution effect, and if this happens when the radicles are in different molecules it is not
unreasonable to suppose that it should happen when both are situated on the same
molecule.

It is, of course, equally possible to regard the difference between X° and X% as
quantitative rather than qualitative. Thus if X¥ is possessed of an M radicle with a
virulence value of, say 10, rather than 5 attributed to X%, and further if this particular
type of M radicle is more stable than those of lower value, then the fact that X” does
