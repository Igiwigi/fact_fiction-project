It is also possible
that faster-X (or faster-Z) effects benefit the homogametic
sex by favouring the fixation of recessive alleles that are
expressed in the heterogametic sex that benefit the homoga-
metic sex. In fruit flies with male heterogamy, for example,
there is evidence of faster-X effects in female-biased_ tran-
scripts [52-54]. In fact, in species with male heterogamy,
there is often a higher proportion of female- than male-
biased expression in sex-linked transcripts [55-59], and in
some species with female heterogamy, there can be an enrich-
ment in sex-linked genes of transcripts with male-biased
expression [60,61]. Could faster-Z effects account for male-biased expression
in X. borealis? Relevant to this possibility is that adaptation
which involves allele frequency changes at many sites
throughout the genome (polygenic adaptation) or beneficial


mutations that appear recurrently or at a high rate are not higher density of transcripts with sex-biased expressionâ€”

necessarily expected to have faster-X evolution [46].
