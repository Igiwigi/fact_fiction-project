polystyrene/poly(phenylene oxide) (PS/PPO) blends. For PS/PVME, the model predictions are
given by the dashed curve and the corresponding experimental data measured in solution at 50°C
by squares (Shiomi et al. 1990). For PS/PPO, model predictions are given by the solid curve
and experimental data measured in solution at 35°C by circles (Weeks et al. 1977). The model
predictions for both systems (PS/PVME and PS/PPO) are derived by fitting to blend PVT data
(parameters available in Tambasco (2006, tables 4.6 and 4.7)), and, in both cases, datasets for
mass fractions of 30/70 and 70/30 were used (Zoller & Walsh 1995).

inherent in such experiments and data analysis. The theoretical predictions are
shown by the curves; in each case the entire parameter set (including g) was
determined by fitting to the blend PVT surface. The theory not only captures
he exothermic nature of mixing in both cases, which is to be expected for
such blends, but in fact appears to provide a ‘home’ for the extremely noisy
experimental data. This analysis gives confidence that the theory will lead to a
deeper understanding of the contributing factors to blend miscibility in systems
‘or which data are scarce.

Figure 6 focuses on the volume change on mixing for the well-characterized
lend PS/PVME. Once again, such data are difficult to obtain, as demonstrated
xy both the very small numbers and the very large error bars. Here the theory
is put to another sort of test. The two curves represent lattice theory predictions
for this blend using two different routes to the characteristic parameters: the
dashed line shows the results applying parameters from fitting blend PVT data,
while the solid line uses results from the fits to pure component PVT data
along with a g-value obtained via a match to the experimental LCST. The
