equation (1.1) or G(u, v) in equation (1.2) was stressed by Pigolotti et al. (2007)
for the case of uniform carrying capacity and interactions depending only on
differences of niche positions, and found to be relevant in an evolutionary context
by Leimar et al. (2008). For that case the positive-definite character of the Fourier
transform of G(u,v) = G(u — v) is a condition implying the absence of limiting

similarity. Species clustering was reported, but for interaction functions rather
different from the Gaussian used in Scheffer & van Nes (2006). In fact, for the
Gaussian interaction case most results are extremely sensitive to details such as
the implementation of the boundary conditions or weak ecological second-order
effects (Pigolotti et al. 2008). Thus, a clarification of the mechanisms leading to
species clustering in LV models would be desirable. In addition, the results in
Pigolotti et al. (2007, 2008) were obtained under the unrealistic assumption of
homogeneity in niche space, whereas the inhomogeneities in the carrying capacity
are known to play relevant roles (Szabé & Meszéna 2006). For simplicity we
restrict our description to the standard situation in which competition is stronger
among species closer in niche space. The existence of studies of LV systems
where non-local interactions beyond that type are considered is worth mentioning
(Doebeli & Dieckmann 2000). That situation can also be described by the
general formalism used here of an integral kernel function, and our general results
