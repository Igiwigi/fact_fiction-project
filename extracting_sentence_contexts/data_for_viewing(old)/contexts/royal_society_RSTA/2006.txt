8. Assuming the properties of the axes of elasticity, find the velocity of transmission
of a wave of light after refraction at the surface of a uniaxial crystal. If the crystal be
bounded by planes perpendicular to the axis investigate the difference of retardation of
the ordinary and extraordinary rays. State briefly how it is shewn by experiment that
plane and circularly polarized light differ from one another.

The results were announced in the Senate-House on 22 January 1841, 10 days after the final
examination. As was common practice, the results were widely reported, both in the national
press—The Times of London regularly printed a full list of the successful students—and in the
local press in which often a ‘local hero’ was celebrated. The reports were also syndicated so that
the same report appeared in different local newspapers up and down the country. Several of
the early reports wrongly claimed that Stokes was the first Senior Wrangler from Pembroke, a
fact corrected in later editions. Many too considered the fact that the Senior Wrangler was ‘an
Irishman’ was a point worth making.

As it happens, the papers that year had been particularly difficult, which resulted in a high
number of failures among classics students. These failures were widely reported, almost more so
than Stokes’ success. The Hull Packet was typical in taking up the story:

The number of names on the printed list, published previously to the examination, contains
145 names; that on the return list is 117. It must not, however, be taken for granted, that all
whose names were on the first list went into the Senate House, and that, consequently,
28 had the misfortune of being ‘plucked’. I believe that 25 is the exact number of these
unhappy ones,—amongst them are some of the best classics in the University, who are
debarred from the privilege of going in for the classical tripos and the medal. For the latter
