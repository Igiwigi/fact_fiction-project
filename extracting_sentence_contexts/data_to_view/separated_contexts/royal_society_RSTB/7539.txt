Hence, so far from providing
grounds for disregarding the wind’s possible orienting influence, the diverse flight-wind
relations demand closer analysis, before any conclusions can be drawn concerning that
influence. This point was made originally by Fraenkel (1932) when he wrote his review of
insect migration. In embarking on the analysis we must revert, therefore, to the simple and fundamental,
but neglected, point made by Uvarov (1928, p. 86) that ‘when there is no wind, or only
a slight breeze, the flight is not affected, though strong winds always carry the swarms with
them.’ ‘Always’ is rather too strong a word, since the locusts often settle rather than let
themselves be carried, but the fact remains that in strong winds, which exceed their own air
speed, locusts must go with the wind if they fly at all. Certain authors (d’Herculais quoted by
de Lépiney 1928; Egypt 1916; Regnier 1926; Zolotarevsky 1929) have long gone further than
this, noting the tendency of low-flying locusts to fly up-wind in light or moderate winds and
to an increasing extent down-wind as the wind speed rises. It has also been known for a long
time that the orientation of flying locusts can vary according to their height above the
ground, for Williams (1933), Predtechensky (1935) and others have recorded instances like
those cited here of swarms consisting of a lower layer of up-wind fliers and an upper layer
of down-wind fliers.
