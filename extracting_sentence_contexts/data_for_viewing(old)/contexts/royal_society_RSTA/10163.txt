(about 1 per cent.), it is not probable that any small amount of impurity present in
them could have materially influenced the positions of the curves. In the case of
aluminium it seems possible that the curve at low temperatures may be a little high,
owing to the small quantity of impurity present in the metal.

The only conclusion which can be drawn from the curves seems to be that the
Lorenz law of constancy of the value of k/«t at different temperatures for each metal
has only a restricted application, and that although the metals which support the law
give nearly the same value, 2°4, for the constant,t the other metals have values of
the constant which differ from 2°4 by amounts far outside the limits of experimental
error.

These facts are not of such a character as to provide strong support for any of the
electronic theories mentioned on p. 439 in their present forms.

A modified. theory has been put forward recently by Professor J. J. THomson§ to
get over a difficulty he pointed out in the older theories, which made the energy
