Participants were then presented with a screen that was described as containing a ‘factsheet’

the website climateinfo.org (see electronic supplementary material, appendix S2, for the full
factsheets, which were in fact created solely for the purpose of the experiment). Each factsheet
contained text describing some of the expected risks of climate change and briefly outlining
possible societal responses to it, including mitigation, adaptation and a third (new) option of
geoengineering. Thus, geoengineering was situated as one of three options for responding to
climate change.
