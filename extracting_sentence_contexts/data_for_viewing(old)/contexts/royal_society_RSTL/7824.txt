VII. 4 Memoir on Cubic Surfaces. By Professor CayLey, P.R.S.

Received November 12, 1868, —Read January 14, 1869.

Taz present Memoir is based upon, and is in a measure supplementary to that by Pro-
fessor ScnLirri, © On the Distribution of Surfaces of the Third Order into Species, in
reference to the presence or absence of Singular Points, and the reality of their Lines,”
Phil. Trans. vol. cli. (1863) pp. 193-241. But the object of the Memoir is different.
1 disregard altogether the ultimate division depending on the reality of the lines, attend-
ing only to the division into (twenty-two, or as I prefer to reckon it) twenty-three cases
depending on the nature of the singularities. And I attend to the question very much
on account of the light to be obtained in reference to the theory of Reciprocal Surfaces.
5 The memoir referred to furnishes in fact a store of materials for this purpose, inasmuch

as it gives (partially or completely developed) the equations in plane-coordinates of the
several cascs of cubic surfaces, or, what is the same thing, the equations in point-coor-
dinates of the several surfaces (orders 12 to 3) reciprocal to these repectively. I found
by examination of the several cases, that an extension was required of Dr. SALMON's
theory of Reciprocal Surfaces in order to make it applicable to the present subject ; and
the preceding © Memoir on the Theory of Reciprocal Surfaces ” was written in connexion
with these inyestigations on Cubic Surfaces. The latter part of the Memoir is divided
into sections headed thus —* Section I=12, equation (X, Y, Z, WY'=0 ” &c. referring
to the seyeral cases of the cubic surface; but the paragraphs are numbered continuously
through the Memoir.
