But, thanks to the bound (2.5) provided by proposition 2.2, for every n € N, we have

Therefore, using the fact that we will select the cubes Qn to be disjoint, it follows that

We conclude that our task is to determine the location of the disjoint cubes Q,, and choose the
sequences {A,,} and {t,} in such a way that
