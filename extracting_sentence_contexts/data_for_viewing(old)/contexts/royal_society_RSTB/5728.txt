the figure depending on the numbers of broods and young: experience puts the lower
limit near 0-02, the figure for a group of E broods with 50 per cent. of dextrals.+
Obviously the lower values of & are reliable only when the breeding has been fairly
ample.

Tf we put together all our « and ¢ groups which are large enough to give fairly accurate
figures, we get a graded series of which some of the members are shown in Table 5.

The whole series of 223 groups is shown in fig. 2. We have a complete gradation of
k values from 0-03 to 1722, i.e., from intensely « groups to almost purely « groups.
There are no obvious gaps in the series, and it is difficult to draw a sharp distinction

* As a matter of fact the dextrals in an < group are seldom concentrated in one or two broods so that i
and the percentage of dextrals generally give much the same relative results.
+ The actual lowest and highest are 0-027 and 15,000.
