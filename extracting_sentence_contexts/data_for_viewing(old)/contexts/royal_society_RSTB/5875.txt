dolichocephalic brains also (cf. the Soudanese brains below) it seldom forms such a sharp
hook.

Another feature frequently observed in brachycephalic brains is the oblique course
of the ascending branch of the calloso-marginalis.

While in the photographs of the second and third dolichocephalic this part of the
callosomarginalis runs nearly perpendicular on the mesial edge of the hemisphere, in
brachycephalics (Plate 39) it frequently approaches the mesial circumference in a
frontally wider arch. This is rather peculiar, as the postauricular shortening of such skulls
is frequently correlated with a steeper parieto-occipital. The more frequent oblique
course of the ascending branch of the calloso-marginal may be explained, however, by the
very fact that the occipital shortness of the brain causes the precuneus to shift forward,
wedging in between the callosum and the ramus ascendens calloso-marginalis and thus
lifting up and stretching the latter.

This shifting of the precuneus may be expressed in another way, suggested by CunNINGHAM, who measured
what he called the parietal and occipital indices by comparing, on the mesial edge, the distance between
the Rolandic and occipito-parietal indentations on one hand, and the distance between the latter and the
lower edge of the occipital lobe on the other.

Applying this method to my Dutch brains I find this relation to hold in the mesocephalics (with great
variation) 5-2 (oce.): 5 (par.), in the brachycephalies 5-2 (oce.): 4-2 (par.), thus showing that the parietal
region in the latter is compressed. As the parietal region extending between the indentation of the central
and the parieto-occipital practically coincides with the precuneus (and a small part in front of it) this also
