ss} The stability of the steady motion of a viscous liquid between two concentric rotating
E cylinders has been studied experimentally by Matnock and by Coverre. These
5 experiments have already been mentioned. The object which both these experimenters
had in view was to determine the viscosity of water by measuring the drag exerted by a
rotating cylinder on another concentric one which was at rest, the space between them
being filled with water. The instability noticed by both of them was inferred from the
fact that the relation between speed of rotation and viscous drag of the liquid ceased
to be a linear one when the speed of rotation was increased beyond a certain limit.
Using this test for instability, Matnock found that steady flow was unstable at all
