be viewed as a distributed system, in which nodes must carefully coordinate
their communication and computation tasks in order to efficiently achieve a
monitoring goal. Lenzen & Wattenhofer [1] highlight the power of distributed
algorithms in solving network coordination tasks, such as carefully scheduling
radio transmissions to avoid interference and synchronizing the clocks of sensor
nodes. They highlight important differences between a wireless sensor network
and an idealized distributed system, and discuss how these differences affect
the design of distributed algorithms and their complexity. They show that the
underlying communication model, which governs how nodes communicate and
interfere with each other, is key to designing distributed algorithms for sensor
networks, and has sparked new interest in the area of distributed computing.

The fact that sensor nodes are embedded within a physical space gives rise
to interesting geometrical structures, and motivates the study of a special class
of algorithms, referred to as geometric algorithms. Gao & Guibas [2] identify
four distinct areas in which geometric structures can be exploited to configure
sensor network operation. First, they can be used in network localization,
ie. to infer the locations of sensor nodes from local measurements, such as
distance and angle estimations between neighbouring nodes. The authors give
an overview of distributed and centralized localization algorithms, explain the
challenge of localization ambiguity (multiple localization solutions that satisfy
the distance/angle constraints) and summarize key theoretical results on graph
rigidity and network localizability. Second, geometrical information can be
used in routing. The authors discuss how physical and virtual coordinates of
sensor nodes can be used to determine the path that a packet follows to a
