histology of fertilization in plants, no one has hitherto investigated in detail the
sytological features of this process in the Abietines.

The oospheres of this group, owing to their large size and the presence of a
quantity of food material, present a strong resemblance to a well-known type of
animal ova. The fact that in this type of ovum the phenomena of fertilization
e usually both much more striking and much more easily followed than is the case
among plants, suggested that the oospheres of the Abietinese might be peculiarly
favourable objects for study. It was with this idea that the work described in the
present paper was begun in 1894,

~ But few observers have concerned themselves with the development of the oophyte
and the process of fertilization in this group. In fact, we owe almost all our know-
edge on these subjects to the researches of Hormetster and STRASBURGER, especially
the latter.

Hormurster (2 and 8),* though he followed out most carefully the development
of the embryo sac and corpuscula in Pinus and Picea, could make very little of the
actual manner of fertilization. According to his observations the nucleus of the
oosphere or “corpusculum” disappeared after a time, becoming dissolved, and in
its place a number of free cells and nuclei made their appearance. It was one of
ese free cells which, as Hormerstrer thought, was fertilized in some mysterious way
y the pollen tube.
