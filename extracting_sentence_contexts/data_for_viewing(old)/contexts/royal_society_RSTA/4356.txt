Many rather (or even substantially) different protein sequences, for example, can perform the :S

same role. Thus, while the ‘meaning’ of a sequence can to some degree be deduced from
homologies, it is not in general the case either that similar protein structures must have similar
functions or that similar functions demand similar structures. Indeed, examples are known
of structurally very different proteins performing the same function, and structurally similar
proteins having different functions [41]. What is more, some proteins have more than one
function, and indeed more than one fold (the so-called chameleon sequences) [42].

It is this delicate balance of robust and optimizable functionality with capacity for innovation
that makes Darwinian evolution possible. This morphology of the phase space is not unique to
proteins and DNA, but applies also to metabolic networks [43] and gene regulatory networks [44].
In fact, it seems to be a general property of complex systems made from permutable elements, and
not even unique to biology [45], implying that it is instead an aspect of how complex information
is naturally organized—albeit one that is as yet poorly understood.

5. Where does causation reside?

A lack of understanding of the ‘logic of life’ [46] leaves many other important questions
unanswered in terms of how DNA fulfils its roles in both development and evolution. There is no
consensus, for example, on whether the genetic system of life on earth is optimized or unique [47].
Certainly, there is no fundamental obstacle to expanding the genetic code synthetically [48]—but
while this can be practically useful in biotechnology, we do not know if it is evolutionarily stable,
or whether completely different systems of informational encoding are viable. And while it seems
clear today that much of the robustness of living organisms—their ability, for example, to adapt to
