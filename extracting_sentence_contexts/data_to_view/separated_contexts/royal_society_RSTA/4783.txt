This positivity principle is so fundamental that
locality and unitarity become derived properties. It should be noted that ‘positivity’ refers to
positive conditions on (generalized) twistor coordinates and has nothing to do with reality or
positive quantities in Minkowski space-time. It is a concept which is based on the simple ordering
of real numbers, on the one-dimensional level, but exploits the fact that this has remarkable higher
dimensional analogues. Notably, this paper refers to on-shell diagrams as the primary objects. They are essentially
the same as Penrose’s original twistor diagrams, though now considered more abstractly and
endowed with a well-defined graph-theoretic structure.
