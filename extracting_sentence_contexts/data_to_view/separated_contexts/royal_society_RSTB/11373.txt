Another interesting aspect that could be inferred from network, the ARACNE network has a low modularity and
the topology is how pluripotency factors are coupled to also a relatively low diameter. It differs from the literature net-
lineage-specific factors in order to regulate the transition work in its degree correlation, which is positive. This fact
from the maintenance of pluripotency to the commitment points towards a hierarchy of nodes, with the highest degree
to certain lineages [34]. nodes connected to the next highest degree nodes, and so on. To derive the network topology, we applied the three The network predicted by partial correlation has the high-
top-performing algorithms and took the top 0.1% of inter- est fraction of nodes with small degree among the predicted
actions across the predicted network. The predicted networks networks.
