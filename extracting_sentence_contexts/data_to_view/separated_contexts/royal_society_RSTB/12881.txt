Indeed, loss aversion con-
cerns the valuation of prospective losses, while the positivity bias concerns the retrospective assessment of past losses. It is important to note that, in humans, although the average values of the behavioural biases are reported as described
above (for instance: inverse S-shape in description-based paradigms and loss neglect in experience-based paradigms; see
figure 3a), their results are further tempered by a high degree of inter-individual variability in the bias parameters. At the
individual level, some subjects may in fact display opposite biases in both experimental settings [72,76]. If inter-individual
variability is equally high in other primates, the fact that monkey studies use very small sample size (figure 2) can contribute
to explaining the comparably less consistent picture observed (table 1).

monkey studies, whenever outcomes and probabilities are con- choices using either model-free or model-based measures
