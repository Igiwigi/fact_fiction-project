a greater conducting power, the latter will tend to draw up towards the place of
greatest force, displacing the former. Such at least is the case with bodies that are
freely magnetic, as iron, nickel, cobalt and their combinations (2357. 2363. 2367. &c.),
and such a result is in analogy with the phenomena produced by electric induction.
If a portion of still higher conducting power be brought into play, it will approach
the axial line and displace that which had just gone there; 80 that a body having a
certain amount of conducting power, will appear as if attracted in a medium of weaker
power, and as if repelled in a medium of stronger power by this differential kind of
action (2367. 2414.).

2799. At the same time that this idea of conduction will thus account for the place
which a given substance would take up, as of oxygen in the axial line if in nitrogen,
or of nitrogen at a distance if in oxygen, it also harmonizes with the fact, that there
are no currents induced in a single gas occupying the magnetic field (2754.), for any
one particle can then conduct as well as any other, and therefore will keep its place;
and it also agrees, I think, with the unchangeability of volume (2750.).

2800. In reference to the latter point, we have to consider that the force which
urges such a body as oxygen towards the middle of the field, is not a central force
like gravitation, or the mutual attraction of a set of particles for each other; but an
axial force, which, being very different in character in the direction of the axis and of
the radii, may, and must produce its effect in a very different manner to a purely
central force. That these differences exist, is manifest by the action of transparent
bodies, when in the magnetic field, upon a ray of light; and also by the ordinary
action of magnetic bodies: and hence, perhaps, the reason, that when oxygen is
