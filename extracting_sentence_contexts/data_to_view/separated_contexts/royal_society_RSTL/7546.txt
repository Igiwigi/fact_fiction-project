by volume, from water to absolute
alcohol; his results, however, differ considerably from those given in this paper. From
the latter it appears that the specific heat of such alcoholic mixtures, up to a strength
of 36 per cent, of alcohol, is above that of water; according to SCHNIDARITSCH the specific

heat of all is below that of water. In fact the specitic heat obtained by him for mix-
tures, up to an alcoholic strength of 60 per cent., is below that obtained in the present
Series of experiments, whilst for all stronger mixtures and absolute alcohol his results
are higher. SCHNIDARITSCH'S paper, though of some length, does not give the requisite data to
check the results obtained by him, inasmuch as the correction applied in each case is
not given. In his statement, however, as to how the corrections were made, there is an
obvious error, as he uses REGNAULT's formula for the amount of cooling observed in his
(Re6xaunT's) calorimeter, though his (ScuxivanIsen's) calorimeter is of different shape
and one-fourth of the size.
