which is occupied by the hydrated ions and molecules of the solute. Then 1-8 will
be the fraction which is occupied by uncombined water. Then the equation
9 = CxBr takes the form n/C = (1—8) 1+ 7’, or

This may be regarded as the fundamental viscosity equation for a simple salt
solution. It may be noted that if we take ras the radion for pure water, we have
its viscosity 7 = Cr, so that for solutions so dilute that the value of the water radion
is not sensibly changed by the addition of the solute we may say

8n = CB (r’—7),

which indicates that if the radion of the solute is less than that of water 8y is
negative. This is in fact the case for KCl, the solutions of which have a less viscosity
than water. Cases of “negative friction” therefore are readily explicable upon the
present hypothesis.
So far the matter is simple, but in applying the above equation in practice we
