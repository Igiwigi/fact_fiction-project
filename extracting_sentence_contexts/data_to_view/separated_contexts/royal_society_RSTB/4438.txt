The unripe seed is an almost perfect sphere, sessile on the apex of the receptacle,
with its axis inclined to that of the receptacle at an angle of about 45Â°. It thus
presents a strong contrast to the condition in Podocarpus, but approaches that in
some species of Daecrydium. The seeds figured by Pricer (1902, p. 117) are all very nearly erect ; this fact may
quite possibly be due to his material being slightly older than that examined by me,
and may suggest that the young ovule is horizontal or even further inclined, as in some
species of Dacrydiuwm. However, in the absence of younger material. these remarks
ean only be taken as conjectures. (See also p. 285, below.) It is worth mentioning
that the seeds here described were collected in March, 1914, on Mount Mou. The surface of the drupaceous seed is covered with bloom and is smooth except for
a slight ridge passing obliquely round the base of the seed, but not forming a
complete circle.
