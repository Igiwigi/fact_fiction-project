The current due to this battery was found to diminish so rapidly that
a set of GRove's cells was used on the third day, which was found to be more constant
than the great battery. A proper combination of the two batteries would perhaps pro-
duce a current which would diminish according to the same law as that of the great
battery. Another difficulty arose from the fact that when the connexions were made,
but before the key was pressed, if the micrometer was touched by the hand the disk
was attracted. This I have not been able satisfactorily to account for, except by leak-
age of electricity from the great battery through the floor. When the micrometer was not
touched, the disk remained at its proper zero.
