144; Count RumrorD's Enquiry concerning the Nature of Heat,

bottom, had full liberty to escape vproards, and to make way for
other particles of colder air to come into contact with the hot
surface, and: be heated, rarefied, and forced upwards, in their
turns; and, under these circumstances, it might reasonably be
expected, that as much heat as possible would be communicated
immediately to the air, by the hot body; and that the heat 80
communicated would of course accelerate the cooling of that
vessel.

It was in fact cooled in a shorter time than the other, No. ,
which was suspended in a vertical position ; but the difference
of the times of cooling was very small ; which indicates, if [ am
not mistaken, that a comparatively small quantity of the heat
a hot body loses, when it is cooled in air, is communicated to
that fluid ; much the greater part of it being sent off through
the air, to a distance, in calorific rays.

The vessel No. 5 was found to cool through the standard in-
terval of 10 degrees in $85 minutes; and No. 6, which was in
a reclined position, in g74 minutes.

It will no doubt be remarked, that the vessel No. 5 cooled
