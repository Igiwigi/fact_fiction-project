Zfinite number of these terms can be utilized, as workable general expressions for the
coefficients in the current function R cannot be obtained. The actual procedure,
S therefore, must be to take a finite number of terms of the Fourrer’s series for p,
Etransform this into a polynomial in cos » (this also, of course, will have only a finite
‘gnumber of terms), and work out the coefficients of R in terms of the coefficients of
& this polynomial to as great a degree of accuracy as is practicable and desirable.
3 This is the course of the work in §§ 18-20, where the terms (a@+) cos o+c cos 2w) of
3 the Fourrer’s series for p are taken, and the expression for R is worked out as far as
concerns the terms in a, b, b®, and c. The resistivity 1/p is introduced into the
A calculations for purely mathematical reasons, on account of certain analytical
advantages which it seems to offer. The results obtained in this way, in terms of
the coefficients of p, might be got otherwise by an extension of the method used by
Scuuster. This identity of results is clear from the fact that if the Fourrer
coefficients of p are small enough the Taytor’s series for 1/p is absolutely convergent,
and the legitimacy of the use of 1/p is in this case immediately evident; the formal
results, however, do not depend on any property of convergence, so that the results
obtained by using 1/p remain equally valid with those obtained in any other way,
even though the series for 1/p should become non-convergent. ‘This is one of many
instances in which it is possible and advantageous to use expressions which may
