Relevance to acoustic radiation of coherent structures in turbulent shear
flows: an outlook

The theoretical efforts have thus far focused on instability modes on laminar flows in order to
provide definitive and self-consistent descriptions. The mathematical procedures and even results
are, however, applicable to coherent structures in the corresponding turbulent shear flows insofar
as the latter can be treated as a wavepacket of instability modes with an amplitude function A. However, two important facts must be noted about turbulent flows. The first is that turbulent
mean flows vary more rapidly in the streamwise direction than their laminar counterparts, and
thus the resulting stronger non-parallelism must be taken into account. Secondly, the coherent
structures are influenced by fine-scale turbulence via the phase averaged small-scale Reynolds
stresses [58].
