This is always true for mutants affecting fecundity (b,(Zm, Z)). For mutants affecting mortality (u,(Zm, Z)), selection strength
is further proportional to the remaining number of offspring
that an individual is expected to produce if it survives to the
next age, 0;,, (ie. the current reproductive value, equation
(3.6)). This quantity may in fact increase with age, for instance
when maturity occurs later in life. Selection on a mutant that
reduces mortality may therefore become stronger as its effects
get closer to age at maturity. These well-known results lay the
basis of the evolution of life-history traits, especially of senes-
cence [49,89,91], and are relevant to age-specific social
behaviour (e.g. [92]).
