From these conditions x and its first derivatives can be computed at all boundary points;
by symmetry only one-quarter of the area need be considered.

The relaxation solution is given in figure 18. The chosen mesh has almost the largest
possible interval, not here because differences diverge at a larger interval, but because at
least two-sixth differences must be obtainable before decisions can be made regarding
the negligibility or otherwise of the difference correction. It was, in fact, negligible. For the
derivative equations at the boundary differences up to the fourth were retained, and the
subsequent correction for higher differences was very small.

The remaining problem is the computation at boundary points of the non-zero principal

stress, given by ae [(X,+-Y,) + /{(X,—¥,)?+4X3}]. (B. 21)

By means of equations (B. 20), Z can be expressed in terms of any one of X,, ¥, or X,, and the
chosen one will be that stress most easily and accurately obtainable from the relaxation

* Cox gave the opinion that the concentration factor would be about the same in the two cases, but that
the point of maximum stress would be nearer to the central section in the case of uniform displacement than
