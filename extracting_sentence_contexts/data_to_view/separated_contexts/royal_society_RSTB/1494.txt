In the case in question there was well-marked lateral nystagmus, and the
eyes were displaced to the side of the lesion as in other cases of transverse section
of the posterior columns on one side, and not to the opposite side as in the cases in
which all the lateral tracts of the medulla were divided and the posterior columns
and their nuclei were left intact. Reflexesâ€”There appeared to be some increased activity of the knee-jerks, though
not to the same extent as after division by the inferior peduncle of the cerebellum
high up or section of the lateral tracts of the medulla. It was exceedingly difficult
to be certain of any real inequality of the knee-jerks owing to the fact that there
always appeared to be a certain amount of flexor spasm of the posterior extremity on
the side of the lesion, while the muscles of the opposite posterior extremity were
much more relaxed during the examination. How much of the flexor spasm in the
posterior extremity on the side of the lesion was voluntary and how much involuntary
