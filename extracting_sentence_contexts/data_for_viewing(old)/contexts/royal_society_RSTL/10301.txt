specimens reached this last stage, and as this one moulted on the last day of the
season I was not able to trace ib any farther, and as I collected no adult specimens of
the game kind, its precise systematic posibion musb at present remain in some
uncertainty. The elose similarity which I shall point out between its larval stages
and those of Zrcifer and Sergestes renders it very probable that it is a Sergestid, and
the analogy of these forms also indicates that the larva shown in fig. 90 has in all
probability nearly or quite attained to the mature form. This larva differs from the
other two forms in the possession of small claws at the tips of the last three pairs of
pereiopods, and as this is characteristic of MiLxe-Epwarps' genus Acetes, and only
three genera of Sergestidze—Lucifer, Acetes, and Sergestes—have been described, T
think we may conclude that we have to do with the development of an American
species of this genus. Ab any rate, whatever the systematic position of the adult may
be, the fact that the Protozoza is in most respects intermediate between the simple
Protozoa of Lucifer and the extremely modified Protozota of Sergestes, gives this form
80 much interest that it seemed best, for the sake of comparison, to embody all that
TI was able to learn about its metamorphosis in the present paper.

At the earliest stage which was observed, the larva (figs. 77, 78, and 79) is a *©Zova ”
16659 inch long, and a comparison of fig. 79 with fig. 44, or of fig. 77 with fig. 43, will
show that ib is essentially like the last Zoza of Lucifer, although the minor differences
are both numerous and conspicuous.

The number of somites and appendages is alike in both forms, and the appendages
are alike in most respects, although each one of them shows distinetive characteristics
of its own.
