‘© _- Equations (11-9) and (11-9a) for the longitudinal displacement agree (apart from a
constant factor) with the equation given by Bancroft who points out in connexion with this
© particular case that the value of u, is independent of the sign chosen in extracting the square
= root when evaluating / and x and that the function /, cannot be complex. These considera-
ep tions hold for all the above equations, and the fact that /,, /,, /3,/, and f; cannot be complex
“= means that each of the quantities £7, u,, u,, #7 and 77 must be in the same phase or in antiphase
+4 at any instant at all points on a cross-section of the bar.
3 Inorder to find the mean values *x and u, of £% and wu, over a cross-section of the bar for
given values of ¢ and a/A it is necessary to calculate the values of f, and /, for different values
