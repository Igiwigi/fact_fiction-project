made the remarks quoted above. Since that time, the mathematics of mock modular forms has, 2 |
in fact, been carried a great deal further and some string theorists now include mock modular

forms in their mathematical toolbox. Unfortunately, it would be too much of a stretch to say “3
that this has brought superstring theory into correspondence with the facts of Nature. It has, oS
however, improved our understanding of one of the best theoretical tests of string theory as a : gS
theory of quantum gravity, namely whether or not it provides a framework in which the entropy 12
of black holes can be understood and computed. In addition, other aspects of Ramanujan’s work : 2
have also had an influence on developments in physics including, in particular, the structure of 1S
conformal field theory (CFT). They have also had great influence on the subject of moonshine, a : 2
still mysterious subject that seems to lie at the boundary of physics and mathematics. I want to :8
give a brief overview of how Ramanujan’s ideas have influenced these subjects. : s

The general topic of this talk is Ramanujan’s influence on physics and physicists and, in iB
particular, his influence on topics connected to string theory. Since I am at the University of : =
Chicago, it seems appropriate to first mention Ramanujan’s influence on the Noble laureate S. : a
Chandrasekhar, who spent most of his career at the University of Chicago. At Hardy’s request, : =
