This second triradiate is situated immediately below the developing spine, and
is the foundation of the future spine boss. While the branches of this triradiate are
elaborating, small processes begin to grow upward from the branches of the plate itself,
and these are met by descending processes. Regarding the formation of the tubercle
TH&EL (1892, p. 52) merely says that, while the plate is developing, “ arms also begin
to grow in a vertical direction from the central part of the plate in order to raise the
tubercle of calcareous network.’ It would seem, therefore, as if he had been unaware
of the fact that the single vertical process which he figures (Plate 7, fig. 97) represents the
first stage in the formation of the tubercle.

2. The Tetraradiate Spine.—It has long been known that, at metamorphosis, the young
urchin (imago) possesses two types of spines, viz. :—tetraradiates which somewhat
resemble those of an asteroid and are transient, and typical, permanent ones. As the
tetraradiates differ so markedly from the inter-ambulacral spines it would naturally be
concluded that their mode of development would also differ.
