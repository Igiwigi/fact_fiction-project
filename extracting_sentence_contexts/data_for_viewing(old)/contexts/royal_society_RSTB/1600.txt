of the tunica externa in relation with the skeletal attachments of the radially
disposed fibres converging from the concavities of the erescentic processes of the
tripodes towards the complex centram, which may either permanently retain their
close fibrous connection with the centrum or become anehylosed thereto. Ramsay
Wuaigat (45) has shown that the creseentic process of the tripus, or at all events the
inwardly curved portion which is imbedded in the dorsal wall of the bladder, is also
formed as an ossification of the tunica externa, and only secondarily becomes con-
tinuous with the vemuinder of the ossicle, The same writer (doc. cit.) refers to the
superficial ossifications investing the sides of the complex and fifth vertebral centra
us ‘developed in convection with the air-bladder,” If this be so the ossifications
ate obyiously due to the conversion into bone of the outer stratum of that part of the
tunica externa of the dorsal wall of the anterior chamber which is moulded and
adherent to the Jateral and ventral surfaces of these centra, aud the fact that the
ossifications are always co-extensive with that part of the dorsal wall which is
represented by little more than the tunica interna, aid certainly appear to replace
the timica externa in that region, confirms this conclusion,* It would seem, there-
fore, a legitimate inference that these ossifications are due to the conversion into bone
of Ube primitively more extensive, purely fibrous attachments of the posterior pillars
to the lateral and ventral surfaces of the complex and fifth centraf im much the same
way that the oblique lateral ridges aod the dorsal lauitnw are ossifications in the
skeletally attached portions of the superficial cont. [t may be also concluded that all
