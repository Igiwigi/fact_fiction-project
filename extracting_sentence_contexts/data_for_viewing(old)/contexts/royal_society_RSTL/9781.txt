and gastric glands. First, that the regeneration of the used-up material takes place
in the pancreas whilst the gland is still secreting, but does not in the gastric glands,
Secondly, that in the pancreas the granules are formed out of the homogeneous outer
zone, and in the gastric glands out of the finely granular cell protoplasm. As to the
first point of difference, we have 8een that in the Frog, Newt, and Toad the used-np
material is regenerated more or less completely whilst secretion is still going on. The
second point of difference chiefly rests on the assumption that the protoplasm of the
fresh cell is finely granular, since in alcohol specimens an increase of protoplasm in the
cell is marked by an increased cloudiness.

The differences which exist with regard to the formation of granules in those cells
which acquire an outer non-granular zone in activity and those which do not we shall
discuss later. We have first to consider what facts we have to support the view given
above as to the changes which take place in the pepsin-forming glands during
8ecretion.

We have to show that (a) the using up of granules, (b) the formation of granules,
and (c) the growth of protoplasm all go on from the beginning to the end of secretion.

(4.) Since it has been shown that the granules give rise to pepsin, and since we
know of no other origin for pepsin, we may conclude that as long as pepsin is formed,
1.e., as long as the secretion goes on, granules are used up.

(b.) We have een that in all cases in the latter half to two-thirds of the digestive
period the granules increase. There can be no doubt that during this time a secretion
