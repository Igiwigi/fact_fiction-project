the conductors are, on the one hand, of non-magnetic metal, 8ueh as copper or
phosphor-bronze, and on the other hand (again as an extreme case) of very soft
annealed iron, kept in a state of vibration. To make a numerical comparison, We
may take wires of 4 mm. diameter, separated by a distance of 20 centims. Then, for
non-magnetic metal,
L=21og 2Z+1=194

And for 80ft iron, under vibration,

= 7=2 log 0-22 20,000=20,018.

Hence, with the assumed data, the iron circuit has one thousand times the solf-
induction of the non-magnetic circuit. This throws light on the fact * that a notable

iron in a line whose electrostatic capacity and resistance are kept unaltered ; and that
the much more rapid electric impulses which traverse a telephone cireuit often become
muffled beyond recognition when iron takes the place of phosphor-bronze. ]
