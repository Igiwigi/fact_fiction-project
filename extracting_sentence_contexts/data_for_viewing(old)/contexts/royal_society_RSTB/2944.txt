Tiidacna, &c.), and on its first formation must be in relation with internal cells,
probably disposed with their edges in contact to form an endothelium. In the
filaments of the adult, however, the appearances presented are those of isolated cells
or groups of cells flattened against the surface of the chitin. A special search was
made for a continuous endothelium in all the sections in which the finer histological
details were to be made out, but in no case were there evidences of more than two or
three cells in continuity. The silver nitrate test, also, applied to longitudinal sections
of Mactra, Ostrea, and Mytilus, failed to provide any unequivocal evidence.

Calcified Rods.

These are calcified structures peculiar to the filaments of the Unionide and
Miilleria. Much confusion has arisen from the fact that some authors, such as
Lancer (49, p. 44), Posner (76), Rast (81, p. 352), and Simpson (94, p. 182)
failed to discriminate between the thickened bands of chitin (Stibchen) such as
occur in the majority of Eulamellibranch gills and these calcareous rods embedded
in the chitin, first noted by RENGARTEN in 1853 (82), and described by Hesstine
in 1859 (33, p. 228) as “ Kalkstiibehen.” The Stiibehen of chitin are but local
thickenings of what must be regarded as a general lining of the filamentar, and

* KELLOGG, curiously enough, does not admit that the intrafilamentar septum is composed of chitin
(42, p. 421, Pecten irradians). He regaids it as cellular—endothelium, in fact.
