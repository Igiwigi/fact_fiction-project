If the lower medium were conducting, we should have had A,C + B, = 0, and the
electric downward traction would be — K,N,?/87, that is — K,A,°/8a + m/4z.
A#*C cos mz. Thus in the equation giving as above the velocity of propagation, the
electric term would be — A,?/4am, or — 470°/K,?m, where o is the density of the
electrification on the interface. The effect of this electrification is thus the same as
that of a diminution of the surface tension by 20°\/K,’, where d is the wave-length.*

81. Relations of Electrification to Vapowr Tension and Fluid Equilibrium.—It
has already been shown (§ 52) that the possibility of mechanical equilibrium between
fluid dielectrics which do not mix requires that the electric tractions on the interface
shall be in the direction of the normal. There are also other dynamical relations
deducible from the fact that such forcives, when integrated round a closed cireuit in
fluid media, must give a null result, in order to avoid the establishment of cyclic
perpetual motions. The earliest example which led the way to relations of this kind
was Lord Ketvry’s establishment of a connexion between the vapour tension of a
liquid and the curvature of its free surface : and similar balances must independently
hold good between vapour tension and other causes of surface traction,

Yonsider in the first place a volume of conducting fluid with a large horizontal free
surface. Let an electric field be established over a portion of this surface ; there
will be a surface density o of electrification induced over that portion, which will
vary from point to point ; while the electric forces will elevate the surface by an
amount /, = 270°/gp where p is the density of the fluid, above the level at a
distance where there is no electrification. The vapour tension over the electrified
