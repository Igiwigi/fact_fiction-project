tubules have a distinct lumen but in others it is occluded.

The second group, figs. 10 and 11, Plates 13 and 14, differs strikingly from the
first, in that the testes appear firm on dissection and are plump and regular in
contour. The tunica albuginea in sections is thin and evenly extended over the
surface of the testis. Within, the spermatic tubules are closely packed together,
the interstices being occupied by interstitial tissue and lymphatic spaces. The
tubules themselves differ from those of the other group of animals in that the zone of
Sertoli nuclei is situated close to the wall of the tubule, without a wide intermediate
zone of cytoplasm. Spermatogonia are much more numerous and there is no trace
of a lumen in the tubules. These testes closely resemble those of young animals in
summer prior to the onset of puberty and it would appear reasonable to assume that
they are in fact prepubertal. The testes of the first type, on the other hand,
obviously belong to animals which have bred previously and which are therefore
in true non-breeding condition. The characteristics of these testes are such as would
be expected when the enormous size difference between those of breeding and
non-breeding animals is considered.

The relation of the diameter of the spermatic tubules to the weight of the testes
is clearly brought out in fig. 5, in which the mean diameters of the spermatic tubules
are plotted against the cube roots of the weights of testes of 91 animals.

It can be seen that there is a linear relationship between the diameter of the tubules
and the dimensions of the testes. A straight regression line was fitted of the form
