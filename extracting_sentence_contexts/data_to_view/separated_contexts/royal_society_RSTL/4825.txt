450 MR. D. SHARPE ON THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE FOLIATION AND

arches along which the foliation is perpendicular. In fact it is not always possible
to distinguish the central axis of the arches, as the slight inclination and numerons
waves of the foliation are most confusing to the observyer near the crown of the arch,
In some places the correspondence between the central axis of the foliation and the
watershed of the district will be an assistance, but in many cases the axis of the arch
of foliation will be most easily ascertained by dividing the distance between the two
vertical boundaries. For these reasons, in describing the geographical arrangement
of the foliation and cleavage through the Highlands, I shall point out in most detail
the lines on which their planes are perpendicular. On the Map which accompanies this paper, the direction of the vertical planes is
marked by double lines as far as I observed them or find them recorded ; these are
continued in double lines of dots to show the supposed continuation of the observed
portions: the central axes are indicated by a single thick line, continued by dots in
the same manner over the unobserved portions of country: the fainter single lines
represent the strike of the foliation over the intervening spaces, the lines being
closest where the dip is the steepest.
