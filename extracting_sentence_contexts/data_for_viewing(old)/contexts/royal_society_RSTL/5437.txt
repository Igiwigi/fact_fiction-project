be supposed, of their resolvability into an acid salt and free alkaline base.

The sulphate of potasb, when strictly neutral, has in different membranes a variable
but always moderate positive osmose, an osmose which the slightest trace of a strong
acid may cause to disappear entirely, or even convert into a small negative osmose.

On the other hand, a minute addition of an alkaline carbonate to the sulphate of
potash appears to give that salt a positive osmose of a high order. It was seen that
the mixed salts produce much more osmose than the sum of the osmose of the two
salts used apart from each other.

This property of sulphate of potash must wait for its explanation, with many other
facts of the subject, till fuller information is obtained than I can at present offer re-
specting the nature of the obscure chemical changes which occur in the membrane
during osmose, and of the mode in which masses of water come to participate in these
changes. The conclusion which has been drawn, that the osmose or movement of
water through membrane is always towards the side of the base, is no theory or
explanation of the phenomenon, but a general description, which appears to apply
with suflicient accuracy to all the observations.

It may appear to some that the chemical character which has been assigned to
osmose takes away from the physiological interest of the subject, in 80 far as the
decomposition of the membrane may appear to be incompatible with vital condi-
tions, and osmotic movement confined therefore to dead matter. But such appre-
hensions are, it is believed, groundless, or at all events premature. All parts of living
