A piece of bees wax, placed in the ſame ſitua-
tion with the albumen ovi of the preceding experiment,
and expoſed to the ſame degree of heat in the ſtove, be-
gan to melt in five minutes: another piece ſuſpended by
a ſtring, and a third piece put into the tin veſſel and ſut-
pended, began likewiſe to liquify in five minutes.

OBSERVATIONS. That heated air ſhould have ſuch a ſpeedy and power-
ful effect in quickening the pulſe, while the animal heat
is little altered from its natural ſtandard; that the human

body ſhould ſo eafily bear to be ſurrounded with air
"heated to 224*; that the albumen ovi, which begins to
coagulate in water at I 50*, ſhould remain fluid in 224";
and that the ſame album? ovi, ſtill placed in air heated to
224, ſhould coagulate if in contact either with tin or its
own ſhell, are facts as ſingular as they are difficult of ex-
pPlanation. From the different effects of heated air on
the pulſe and the heat of the body, do we not diſcover
the fallacy of that theory of animal heat which has been!
adopted by BOERHAAVE and other celebrated phyfiolo-
giſts? They ſuppoſe that animal heat is produced by the
attrition of the 2/0bJes of the circulating fluids againſt
the ſides of the containing veſſels; but in ſeveral of the
preceding experiments, the circulation was amazingly
quickened with little increaſe of the animal heat.
