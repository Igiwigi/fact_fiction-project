Finally, I have to acknowledge the many kindnesses I haye received during this
investigation. Of Professor Sacns' kindness to me it is impossible for me to speak
sufficiently highly. The mere fact that it was ab his suggestion that this work was
undertaken will Â«how how much I owe him. To my friend and former teacher,
Dr. S. H. Vixzs, I am indebted for much valuable advice, Especially must I also
express my most sincere gratitude to my friend, Dr. D. H. Scorr, not only for his
valuable eriticisms and suggestions, but for the many assistances that he has given
me in every possible way during the whole of this difficult work. NorE.
