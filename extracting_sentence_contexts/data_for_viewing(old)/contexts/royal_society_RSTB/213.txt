of the currents from the dorsal to the ventral surface by the shortest route, through
the neighbouring columns.” And further on :—“ However that may be, the instance of
internal adaptation to which we have been now led far surpasses all earlier ones in
ingenuity. It would certainly have demanded the profoundest reflection of a clever
brain to hit upon the idea of making each column as good a conductor for its own
shock as any other animal tissue can be, but comparatively a non-conductor for the
current of all other columns. In connexion with the extremely transitory nature of
the shock, it is not a little remarkable that it is only currents of extremely short
duration that the organ conducts irreciprocally. Of what service would it have been
to the fish if it had become a perfect non-conductor for continuous heterodromous
currents also 2?” *

As a matter of fact, however, each column conducts with equal facility its own
homodromous shock and the returning heterodromous current of the shock of its
neighbours, but in the latter case it is excited, as indeed it is by the current of its
own response. The teleological significance, then, of the phenomena is not what
pu Bors-Reymonp imagines; if anything, it means that a single response has a
reverberating character, due probably to the current of the response acting as a
stimulus to the nerves in the columns, and thus each column reinforces by its echoes

the effect of the primary explosion.
