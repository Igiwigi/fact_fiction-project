distortions [1,2]. This, in fact, severely inhibits their uses and applications. This behaviour is 2 |
generally attributed to the presence of quenched defects like hairline microcracks, interstitials,

dislocations or vacancies in these materials [3]. The defects cause distortion of the stress field 3
around the defects and anisotropy in the field distribution. The local fields at sharp edges of a :8
defect can be enhanced tremendously and may exceed the fatigue limit of the material setting ig
off the defect to grow. In this way, nucleation of fracture occurs even when the applied stress is : a

low [4]. Brittle solids commonly have strength of ojq/100 where ojq is the ideal strength calculated
from the snapping of atomic bonds with common interatomic potentials. Ordinary window glass
breaks at about 10* psi (its ideal strength approaches 10° psi); cast-iron at about 3 x 104 psi.

A first principle analysis of fracture is, however, viable only in very specific cases, like
