Q. E.D.

(®) For if Q*=KT for an indefinite numher of systems of values of a, b, c, d, e, f, of which Q, I are rational
integral functions, Q* and KI? must be abslutely identical; this of course is the case when Q? and KI? as proved
in the text, are known to be identical for all yalues of «, b, c, 4, e, f which do not make L zero.

It may be said that the case of three or more equal roots existing in F (a, y) has been

- turnedintoan operator becomes a%* E -) (! 3) which, applied to the Hessian, viz. 3aeu't*+ ftv" —e, after

multiplying by —75, gives K=—2c&, 80 that D=J?—128K=aif*+2560%, which is capable of easy verifi-
cation, In fact D becomes the resultant, of au'+ev! and v(4eu+fv); v* introduces the factor a* into D; and
further, making u: v::—F#: 4e and substituting in au'+ev!, we obtain the other factor af *+ 2566,

If we adopt w*+5euv* +»! as the reduced form for the failing case (a form analogous to the well-known one,
u+6en?-+v*, for the general quartic), to find e we have J= 4, K=—2p%, Hence =— 29 thus when
K=0, e=0.

(*) By a linear transformation wo may always take away any two (except the two first or last) coefficients of

Qa given quintic, but the yanishing of more than two coefficients always corresponds to some invariantive con-
< dition, Thus, ev. gr., in the form

ae—4bd +3f=0, af—3be+2d=0, bf—4ce+3d*=0.

-SThe three quantities equated to zero are not separately inyariants, but constitute in their ensemble an invarian-
tive plexus.

5 (*) [Tt may here be noticed incidentally that the conditions for equal roots in the biquadratic form are
Sas follows, For two equal roots, of course, the discriminant is zero, for three equal roots the two lowest in-
Evariants are each zero, and for two pairs of equal roots the Hessian (A, B, C, D, EL#, y) becomes to a factor
