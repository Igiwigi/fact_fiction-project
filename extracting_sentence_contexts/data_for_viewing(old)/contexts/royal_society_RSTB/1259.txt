478 PROFESSOR F. 0. BOWER ON THE MORPHOLOGY

proceed it will be shown how this morphology, based on ontogeny, has left per
and erroneous traces, which the modern views of phylogeny have not yet oblit
and that in certain most essential points the two methods are at variance—in
case, views based on sound comparison must take precedence over conclusions
from the mere study of the individual.

During the fifty years which followed the publication of Gorrun’s essay, litt}

was extended, but in the light of our present knowledge it is plain that these
not be properly understood except upon a basis of comparison with the archege
plants. This is amply illustrated in the text-books of the period ; in the conel
pages of the first volume of his ‘ Organographie Végétale,’ Aua.-Pyr. pe Cay
