axon. Two of the others appeared to be giant fibres making contact with the cell body at
the base of the ‘axon hillock’. The end of each fibre was slightly swollen and the bounding
membrane of one, although as usual somewhat indistinct, appeared to be intact, sug-
gesting synaptic contact rather than fusion. The contents of the fibres were stained fairly
darkly, but that of the cell body with which they made contact was practically un-
stained.

A careful search through three other complete series of sections and more brief examina-
tion of many other specimens failed to reveal another neurone in this position. Typically
the nerve cells lie clear of the layer of nerve fibres, which do not make direct contact with
cell bodies. This epithelial position of the neurones may possibly be a primitive character,
but may equally well be neotenous, since vertebrate neuroblasts develop from neuro-
epithelial cells. The fact that a cell may occur deep in the nerve-fibre layer as an abnor-
mality, and then appears to receive synaptic connexions from neighbouring axons, would
agree with the view that the usual condition is neotenous.

(c) Collar epidermis

The five zones into which the collar epidermis is divided, as in other Enteropneusta,
are outlined in figure 7. The first zone has a comparatively thin epithelium and contains
few gland cells (none in its posterior border). Abundant mucus cells are present in the
third and fourth zones, and many elongated mulberry cells lie near the surface of the
epithelium in the third zone and towards the posterior end of the second zone. The fifth
zone contains no mucus cells, but numerous elongated gland cells which are stained darkly
by silver methods. The epithelium is ciliated throughout and so thick and complex that
