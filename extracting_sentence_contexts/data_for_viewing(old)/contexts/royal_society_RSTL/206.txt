against this hypothesis are to be derived from the recent ex-
periments of Mr. Bronte, and those of M. M, DeLarocue
and BERARD.

Dr. BLack's hypothesis appears to me far more satisfactory
than Dr. Crawrord's, and capable of explaining a much
greater number of phenomena; but there are objections even
to this hypothesis which must be removed, before it can with
propriety be received.

The last hypothesis, which I mentioned, that which refers
animal heat to vital action, has many facts in its support, and
especially the results of Mr. Brovrz's curious and interesting
experiments; and the results of my inquiry, as I have already
observed, are not incompatible with it, It may be said, that the
viscera of the thorax and abdomen are of highest temperature,
because these parts are, as it were, the elaboratories of life; and
that the heat of the arterial blood, and of the parts best s8up-
plied with this fluid, is greatest, because they lie deepest and
abound most in the principle of life or vital action. This ex-
planation was suggested to me by my brother Sir H. Davy.
There are some facts which T have observed agreeable to it,
but not more s0 than to the hypothesis of Dr. BLack. I have
found the stomach of the ox, the pyloric compartment, of a
