]. Introduction

For thousands of years, the epidemic spreading of diseases has been one of the greatest threats
to societies around the world. Now, with increased mobility, diseases tend to spread faster and
wider due to air traffic and, in fact, often globally. The resulting pandemics can cost the lives of
millions of people and disrupt social, economic, public, political and cultural life.

These challenges are increasingly countered with new measurement and vaccination
technologies [1]. In particular, digital technologies have enabled data-driven and Al-based
methods [2-4], which have become quite popular. Some organizations even envision a future
with ubiquitous health measurements, using, for example, in-body sensors [5].

Data analytics is also used for non-pharmaceutical interventions to handle an epidemic, such
as lockdowns, social distancing, or the use of face masks. The effects of such interventions
have been studied extensively to understand the possible impact on the trajectory of epidemics,
including the current COVID-19 pandemic [6-12].
