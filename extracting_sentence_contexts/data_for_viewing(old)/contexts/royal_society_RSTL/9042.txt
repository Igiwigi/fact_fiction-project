determine what is the greatest possible deflection of the pole which can be caused by
the removal of given quantities of matter from one part of the earth to another, subject
to the above condition as to height and depth.

14. Problem in Maxima and Minima.

This involves the following problem :—To remove a given quantity of matter from
one part of a sphere to another, the layers excavated or piled up not being greater than
k in thickness, 80 as to make 4/ D*+F? a maximum, the axes being 80 chosen as to make
B==0

If D', Y! be the products of inertia referred to other axes having the same origin
and axis of 2 as before, it may easily be shown, from the fact that D*+F*=D*+F7,
that D*+1? is greatest and equal to E* for that distribution of matter which makes
D'=0 and E' a maximum.

GEOLOGICAL CHANGES ON THE EARTH'S AXIS OF ROTATION. 29]

The problem is thus reduced to the following :—Rectangular axes are drawn at the
centre of a sphere of radius c; it is required to effect the above-described removal of
matter, 80 that the product of inertia about a pair of planes through z, and inclined to
