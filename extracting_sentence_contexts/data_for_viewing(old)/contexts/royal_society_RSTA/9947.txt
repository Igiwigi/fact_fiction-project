(i.) For the lake pressure, the values of 6y);, found directly from the co-ordinates
wandz. They are given in Table IX.

(ii.) For the force at a point 34°74y)., found from the factors 7 and r sin 8, measured
on a large sheet of scale paper. 34°74yy is also given in Table IX. They may be of
use to anyone re-working the problem for a dam of a different shape.

(iii.) A linear function added to the above two in order to make the sum agree
with the values of y on the air surface behind the dam. It would have been simpler
to have altered the surface values to make them agree with the base, but I did not
think of that in time. This linear function is most conveniently specified by its first
differences, which are dy/éx = +9°735, ox/dz = —15°35, and by the fact that it
vanishes where the point-force cuts z= 0. These first differences were calculated
from the first space-rates of the expression —34°7477'76 sin 0 along and normal to
6 = —58° 54’, and were used to calculate the linear function.

(iv.) Finally, —42* was calculated and added.

* By calculation more exactly 1°340.
