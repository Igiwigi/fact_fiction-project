MULLER, too,
found no indications of change in the gases investigated by him. His assumption
that the compressions and rarefactions in his apparatus are adiabatic is so improbable
that we are bound to suppose his results are too low, but the method should be capable
of showing relative changes. In fact, no observer but WÃ©LtNer has ever found any appreciable change of y with
the temperature, and it is possible that the arrangement of his apparatus at least
exaggerated the change he found. Hence, so far as previous observations go, there is a presumption in favour of the
constancy of y.

Independently of this, there is something to be said in favour of choosing some
constant temperature, for as the chief interest of y arises from its relation to the
internal energy, it seems desirable to secure that either the internal, the translational,
or the total energy should be constant, and we can make the translational energy
constant by working at a constant temperature. Consequently it was decided to
work at the temperature of the room.
