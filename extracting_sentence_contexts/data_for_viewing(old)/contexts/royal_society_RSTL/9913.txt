On both plots, 14 and 16, Alopecurus pratensts is plentiful and increasing. With
the mineral manure and the smaller quantity of nitrate (plot 16) there was a larger
proportion of Holcus lanatus, and much more of Avena flavescens, Agrostis vulgaris,
and Festuca oving, especially of the two latter ; but there was a smaller proportion of
Lolium perenne, considerably less Dactylis glomerata, and very much less of both Poa
trivialis and Bromus mollis ; in all, a less proportion of total Gramineae than with the
double amount of nitrate. There was, however, much more leguminous herbage,
especially in the later years, and chiefly Lathyrus protensts. There was also a larger,
but a decreasing, proportion belonging to other orders ; more Ranunculus, both acris
and bulbosus, more Conopodium denudatum, more Achillea millefolium, and more
Rumex acetosa, but much less Anthriscus than on 14.

Tn fact, on plot 16, with the smaller amount of nitrate, a greater variety of grasses
contributed the bulk of the produce, but there was a less proportion of the more freely-
growing species. The herbage was made up in considerably less proportion of
Graminez, and it contained both a greater number of species, and a considerably
greater percentage by weight, of those belonging to the leguminous and other orders.

As already mentioned, the average percentage of mineral matter in the dry sub-
stance is highest in the miscellaneous, lower in the leguminous, and lowest in the
gramineous herbage. The dry matter of the gramineous herbage, again, contains the
lowest average percentage of nitrogen, that of the miscellaneous a higher, and that of
the leguminous much the highest. Hence, we should expect a higher percentage of
both mineral matter and nitrogen in the dry substance of the less gramineous mixed
herbage grown by the smaller amount of nitrate, and this is actually found. And, as
