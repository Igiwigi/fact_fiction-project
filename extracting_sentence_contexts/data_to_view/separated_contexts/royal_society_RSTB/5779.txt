Introduction. The chemical examination of sea water had shown that, as the spring advanced, the
surface water became more alkaline and its phosphate content much reduced. These
changes were shown to arise from the action of the phytoplankton, and the fact that they
were, in these latitudes, mainly limited to the upper fifteen or twenty metres suggested
that lack of light hindered growth at greater depths. It was natural to seek for quantitative information on this subject, and as alternatives
the photographic and photo-electric methods presented themselves. The former had
been used to a considerable extent, notably by Grey (1913, 1914).
