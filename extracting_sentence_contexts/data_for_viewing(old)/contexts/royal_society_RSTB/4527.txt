suggestion which is in consonance with the views expressed by the Zuntz school and
by Benepicr and Caracarr. It is, however, rather a remarkable feature that the
fall of respiratory quotient after the stop of the work only becomes obvious in the
experiments with work of 1056 kg.m. per minute, though Experiment 6 with work of
704 kg.m. per minute actually led to a greater total output of energy, owing to the
longer duration of the work. In the experiments at 1056 kg.m. per minute, how-
ever, the work was done at a greater rate, and the average respiratory quotient was
at a higher level during the work, so the actual effect on carbohydrate metabolism
may have been greater. At first sight, one is liable to suggest that the high oxygen
consumption in the final steady period of Experiment 9 may indicate some trans-
formation of fat into carbohydrate to make up for the depleted stores of the latter,
for this would entail some oxygen consumption without corresponding CO, produc-
tion. Against this is the fact that in our experiments the energy output (calculated
by the Zuntz-Schumburg Tables) is practically identical in the preliminary resting
period and in the final stages of the rest following the work: e.g., in Experiment 9
the calorie output per minute during the preliminary rest is 1°50 calories, and during
the final steady period after work 1°55 calories, and in Experiment 8 these figures are
1°36 and 1°37 respectively.

In Experiment 12 with very severe work of 1232 kg.m. per minute the respiratory
quotient falls to a very low value in the later stages of rest following the exertion,
and for the last 57 minutes of the experiment is well below 0°7. The CO, output
during the whole of this period is extremely low, especially if one considers it in
relation to the oxygen consumption, and there seems little doubt that this is mainly
determined by retention of CO, to make up for the large quantity of preformed CO,
