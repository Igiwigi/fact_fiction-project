In
Stage IT (fig. 2) they have a distinctly Reptilian appearance, and show great simi-
larity to the conditions observed in Cynognathus. In Stage V and VI the charac-
teristics of the Mammalian hard palate are exhibited without the secondarily acquired
Marsupial fenestration. The pterygoids in Perameles are much reduced in size ; in fact, in the young stages
they are mere flakes of bone on the ventral side of the much-enlarged processus basi-
pterygoideus of the ala temporalis. However, in the later stages (fig. 21), in spite
of the reduction in size, the pterygoids exhibit a tendency to form a plate over the
ventral surface of the sphenoid. They also retain their old articulation with the
palatines.
