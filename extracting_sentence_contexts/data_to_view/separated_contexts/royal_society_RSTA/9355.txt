For instance, the
extreme value, 129°2 in August 1893, was preceded by 88°8 in July and followed by
77'9 in September. Thus we should not expect a correspondingly high value of R
unless the influence of previous months is negligible. In considering the significance of Table XLV. allowance should be made for the fact
that some of the groups come entirely from years of sunspot maximum. No value of
S as high as 60 occurred in the sunspot minimum or intermediate years. Again,
sunspot minimum years gave no value of § larger than 205, and so their contributions
a were practically confined to the groups 0 to 10 and 10 to 20.
