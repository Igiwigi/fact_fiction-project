Z cola. T. nebuloss is an elegant Annelid. It is large enough to admit of dissection. In
E the summer months the blood-yascular system is highly developed, the branchiz are
= brightly florid, and the segmental organs (when the worm is opened) present an intensely
2 vascular appearance.
FB Dissected in the usual mode, removing with care the alimentary canal, it will be seen
= that a series of curved elongated sacculi (of which fig. 12 are two specimens) exist on
E either side of the ventral median line. They extend throughout the setiferous portion
of the body (in this family it may be called the thoracic), and seem to be as numerous
<V as the largest setiferous feet, which in T. nebulosa are sixteen in number.
= Although the identity of the segmental organ of Terebella and that of Arenicola is 80
5 evident as to admit of no doubt, yet there are between them several differential features.
In Terebella the organ is more deeply divided by the partition (fig. 12 A. j &) between
the limbs than it is in Arenzcola, a fact which approximates it more nearly to « tube.
The vascular appendage (þ, B) is also differently placed. In Terebella it is in con-

Sexes in Arenicola and Terebella (Comptes Rendus,'xvi. 1843); but long before this, STAxx1vs had concluded
that the sexes were separate in Arenicola, from the fact that in different individuals the contents of the
general cavity of the body were different (Mixzr, Archiv, 1840). STaxxrvus also observes that the parent
sperm-cells leave the segmental organ (his testes) before the formation of the spermatozoa, which are found
only in the cavity of the body. Kron, in Alciopa, confirms this fact (Wiz@xanxN's Archiv, 1845). Put
the great mistake committed by Kron, Frey and LEVOKART is, that they assert that in Arenicola, Alciopa,
Nereis, Syllis, Sabella and other Annelids, the ova and the gpermatozoa © are developed free in the general
