It will subsequently be expressed in terms of the function D(z) introduced into the
& theory of the functions G (z|7) (‘ Genesis of the Double Gamma Function,” § 4). It will be seen later that the algebra of the double gamma function would have
& been slightly simplified had a modified value been taken for this function y,(,, «s),
3 and the analogue shortly to be considered, y2,(w,, @,). I did not observe this fact

cient importance to demand the labour which such a change would entail. A Corollary.—N otice that it has been proved incidentally that

§ 22. As the numbers in m and m’ enter constantly into the analysis, it is necessary
to consider their properties.
