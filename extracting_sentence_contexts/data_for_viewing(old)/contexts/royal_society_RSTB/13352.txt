(c) Quantifying uncertainty in the tree

Finally, the advent of Bayesian phylogenetic inference offers
researchers the advantage of constructing a posterior distri-
bution of possible phylogenies, whereby each unique tree
topology and set of parameter settings is represented by its
posterior probability. Bayesian inference sits in contrast with
previous methods of phylogenetic reconstruction—which
instead produce point estimates of the single best tree—

the rates of horizontal trait transmission simulated by Nunn tree estimate. cs
et al. were unrealistically high, and in fact the results from the S
phylogenetic comparative methods did not perform any N
worse than linear regression. Our recommendation is that cau- 4. Ma pp i ng other cultural features to lexical s

likely to interact with the tree shape and trait rates. Of mechanistic (un)identifiability and model
course, with much higher levels of borrowing, the initial pat- ;

tern of vertical descent can become obscured. For example, in shortcomi ngs

a phylogeny of football [48], geography trumped genealogy. We propose that the cultural trees that best match population
Canadian football appeared closer to varieties of American history are generally those constructed from the basic
