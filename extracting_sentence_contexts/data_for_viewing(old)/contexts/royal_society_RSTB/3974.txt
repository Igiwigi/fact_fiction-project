bone in the lower vertebrates which is at present called pterygoid.

Through the kindness of Profs. J. T. Witson and J. P. Hitt I have been enabled
to examine the condition of affairs in embryos of Ornithorhynchus, and so far as the
facts are concerned I feel compelled to agree with Gaupp’s observations. In
Ornithorhynchus as in Echidna there are two “ pterygoid” elements. On the other
hand I feel inclined to differ from GAurp’s conclusions as to the homologies of the
elements.

The two “ pterygoid” elements are even more strikingly distinct in Ornitho-
rhynchus than in Echidna. Near the back part of the palatine there is seen
a distinct bony element of considerable size lying above it and forming the outer
wall of the air passage. The condition is very similar to that figured by Gaupp in
Echidna, as will be seen by comparing his figure with mine. Farther back the
palatine ends rather abruptly, and its place is taken by the large so-called
“pterygoid.” The smaller upper element becomes much reduced on passing back-
wards. In the figures I give its relations to the “pterygoid” are seen (Plate 7,
