external form and even the venation of the leaf, however, would by themselves carry
_ ho decisive weight, though hundreds of fossil species have been referred to the Ferns
on no better grounds. But beyond this, the internal structure of the le: uf is now
well known in Lyginodendron, and to a less degree in Heterangium, and proves to be
in all respects that of a Fern, as is shown most clearly by the concentric structure of

the vascular bundles in the petiole and rachis. This fact holds good for both genera,
Both in structure and form, then, the leaves of Lyginodendron and Heterangium ave
Fern-leaves, their one point of difference being the occurrence of pitted as distinguished
from scalariform tracheides in their xylem.

Now, as regards Lyginodendron, the distinctively Fern-like character is limited to
the foliage; this, however, is not the case with the other genus. Apart from the —
secondary growth, the stem of Heterangium is essentially that of a monostelic Fern
of the Gleichenia type. The resemblance of the stele of Heterangiwm to that of a
Gleichenia is, in fact, very marked, as regards the distribution of the tracheides and
conjunctive parenchyma, the position of the protoxylem-groups, and the presence of
a wide pericycle. We think the comparison with Gleichenia may prove to be a fertile
one, and hope to pursue it further on another occasion. It is not at all unlikely that
