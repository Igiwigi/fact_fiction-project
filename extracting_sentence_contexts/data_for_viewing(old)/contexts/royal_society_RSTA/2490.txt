going forward and backward even if it is completely reversible. This entropic effect can lead to
‘electrochemical creep’ after many cycles, resulting in roughening of the electrode particles [14].

To compare the y-surfaces from figure 9 more closely, we examine the energy along the dotted
line connecting O3 to P3 to O1 to O03, shown in figure 10. The preferred coordination of the
intercalant in the fault plane at each special point is also shown. For both LiCoO2 and NaCoO2,
the intercalant favours prismatic coordination in a local P3 stacking and octahedral (as opposed
to tetrahedral) coordination in a local O1 stacking. However, the relative stabilities of each local
stacking are different. In NaCoOz, local P3 stacking is more favourable than O1, and both are
local minima. In LiCoOy, the situation is reversed, and P3 is actually an unstable maximum. This
confirms the established fact that Li is too small to stabilize prismatic coordination. The CoO
curve has its lowest value in O1, has a local minimum in a local 03 stacking, and has a maximum
for a local P3 stacking, with smooth transitions in between. By contrast, the curves for LiCoO, and
NaCoO are mostly smooth but both contain a sharp cusp between the O1 and O03 minima that
corresponds to an abrupt change in the intercalant position as the structure is sheared. The smooth
transitions (03 < P3 and P3 < O1) require the intercalant to travel along with either the top or
bottom layer as the crystal is sheared. However, for the O1 < O3 transition, if the intercalant
travels continuously along with either the top or bottom layer it moves toward a tetrahedral
site (black dotted circles in the insets of figure 10), which is higher in energy than the preferred
octahedral site. The presence of this cusp feature highlights an important subtlety of y-surfaces in
layered intercalation compounds in that careful consideration of intercalant site preference must
be accounted for when calculating them.
