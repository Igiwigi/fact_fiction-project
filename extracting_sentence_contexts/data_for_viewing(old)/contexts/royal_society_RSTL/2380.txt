'These considerations induced me to extend my experiments much beyond
the limits which I had originally proposed to myself ; and as these experiments
were made with great care, and I may fairly state, without any consideration
of what might or might not be in conformity with theoretical views,they will
afford good tests which may be applied to any theory of magnetism, as well as
to the laws with which I have compared them. Previously to detailing any of
these experiments, or to entering upon any investigations founded upon the law
which they 80 decidedly establish, I shall briefly notice the facts which I as-
certained, and the general explanation they afford, in conformity with that law,
of the experiments which are considered by their author to be decisive of its
fallacy.

In the first instance, I ascertained that if any bar of steel; uniformly mag-
netized by the method of double touch, have this state of its magnetism dis-
turbed, by drawing the end of a magnet from its centre to the end of the same
