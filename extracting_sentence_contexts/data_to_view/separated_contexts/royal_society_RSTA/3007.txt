Since then, local hidden variable models have been discarded through the multiple successful
experimental violations of Bell’s inequalities [2-8], and for many quantum physicists it is now
well established that the world is non-local. In such a non-local world, quantum randomness
has a clear justification, for it prevents parties from communicating faster than light and
protects Einstein’s causality [9]. Actually, the fact that nature is intrinsically random is taken
for granted in various reconstructions of quantum mechanics, which is envisioned within the
framework of generalized probability theories [10,11]. However, the causes of randomness in
the quantum world—as well as the very impact of quantization and discreteness on the nature
of quantum randomness, are rarely discussed. Actually no alternative, physical explanation has
been proposed that would replace the Heisenberg’s microscope.
