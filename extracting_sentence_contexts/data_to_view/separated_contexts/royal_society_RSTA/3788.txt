At the same time this is not due to
any difference in the nature of the carbons, since the actual experimental values
obtained by Mrs. Ayrron,* and on which her equation is based, fit the Curve VII.
with considerable accuracy. The whole of this large difference between Mrs. AYRTONâ€™S
equation and the experimental results is due to the fact that the equation is based on
the range of are lengths of from 1 millim. to 7 millims., and that the equation no
longer represents the facts if we extrapolate any considerable amount. Even over
the range of from 1 millim. to 7 millims.
