Some phenomenological applications for the current universe

After a good deal of technically difficult efforts aimed at putting the foundations of the RVM ona
sound theoretical basis within QFT in curved space-time, it should now be welcome to bring
forward some phenomenological applications. We may start from the low-energy expression
(5.10), or even from the generalized one containing an additional term ~H and a new coefficient
d which is also possible [57,58]

Pvac(H) = arc + vH? + 5H) + O(H%). (8.1)

The additive parameter cp is the same as in (7.4), fixed by pyac(Ho) = Porc Mind that co cannot
vanish as otherwise the model would be excluded due to the absence of an inflection point
from deceleration into acceleration in the cosmic evolution, see [89-92]. In particular, this fact
alone excludes the simpler model pyac(H) Â« H? asa consistent vacuum model. Within the class of
the RVMs, however, the condition cp #0 is always guaranteed. Let us just note that an additive
constant is always generated from integrating the RG equation associated with the 6-function
(6.13).
