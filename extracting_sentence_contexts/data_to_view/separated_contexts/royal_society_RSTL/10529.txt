REINOLD AND A. W. RUCKER

{ assumptions, decided whether or no evidence of a difference of 8urface tensio!
| exceeding a given amount is forthcoming, we are then at, liberty to reconsider the
probable constitution of the film in view of the facts which experiment has elicited. ]
| In studying the properties of the black portion of a s0ap film, it is also important
to remember that it has a well-defined boundary which indicates an apparent discon-
tinuity in the thickness. It may be urged that if the thickness is less than that of
two 8urface layers there must also be an apparent discontinuity in the 8urface tension_
| at the edge of the black. If this were 80, a free globular bubble, consisting of two
| - parts, a, coloured portion and a black © polar cap,” could not be spherical, but must
| consist of two 8pherical segments which meet at a finite angle.
