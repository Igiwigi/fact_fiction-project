When the observing position of the microscope has been chosen, Â¢ and
become constant. In the present instrument it is found possible to observe so close
to the upsetting position of the lever that the microscope can be set much closer than
the circle can be read. It is because of this fact that we have adopted the plan of
increasing the effective circle sensitiveness by giving the thread three whole turns. The circle has a radius of 7 inches, and with our present experience, we are inclined
to think that it would be better for the future to use a larger circle and reduce the
twist of the thread. The sensitiveness of the instrument to gravitational changes is given by the value
of d6/dg, and from (1) this is
