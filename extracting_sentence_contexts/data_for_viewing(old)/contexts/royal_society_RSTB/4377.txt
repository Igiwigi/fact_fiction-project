this side, accompanied by actual dislocation of neighbouring fragments of bone and
evidence of splintering, is undeniably a post-mortem injury, and is clearly the result of
direct violence. There is, on this side, no indication of the skull having been very
plastic at any time during its mineralisation, and it is highly probable that extreme
plasticity played a very minor part in the production of the distortions present.
Furthermore, in determining the median plane on the undeveloped skull, a straight
plane was marked out. Though the actual process of dividing the skull was
technically faulty, as shown by the overlapping of the saw cuts, the straight plane
determined upon was adhered to anteriorly and posteriorly and divided the skull
accurately in the median plane. Had any marked lateral distortion of the brain-case
been present, a plane cut passing through the prosthion, nasion and glabella
anteriorly would have passed some distance to one or other side of the median plane
posteriorly. These facts suggest that, on the left side, no marked lateral distortion
is present. But there is more definite proof available that the injury to the skull
has affected it on the left side only locally, except in the regions of the occiput and
basis cranii.

The basion, as has been pointed out, is not recognisable, and the fractures in this
region make any direct reconstruction fallacious, so that accurate comparisons by
orientation with reference to the basi-cranial axis are not possible. The inion also
cannot be identified, and therefore comparisons withâ€™ other crania poised on the
glabello-iniac plane cannot be made. This is much to be regretted, since so many
data are available for other fossil skulls referred to this horizon. The base line
suggested by Kerra (3) is, however, available. This line, drawn from the orbital
margin at the fronto-zygomatic suture to the posterior inferior angle of the parietal
