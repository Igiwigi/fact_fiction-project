AcTio0Nn of HEaT UPON Ox1DE of METHYLODIETHYLAMYLAMMONIUM.

When submitted to distillation this compound is decomposed like the analogous
substances, the product being water, pure olefiant gas, which was identified as formerly,
and a very remarkable nitrile-base, containing the three different alcohol-radicals, an
ammonia, in fact, in which the first equiv. of hydrogen is replaced by methyl, the
second by ethyl, the third by amy], and which receives the name methylethylamyl-
amine.

This reaction shows that ethyl yields its place even to methyl, a fact which could
not have been anticipated from analogy, methyl occupying a lower position than
ethyl in the system. The above deportment is moreover remarkable, when con-
sidered in another point of view. The elimination of methyl in the case under
