an atomic weight of 9:2 snited the properties of the metal in the tables of periodicy
constructed by MM. MgxDeLEey and LoTHaR MEvyER, this atomic weight has, up to
= quite recently, been generally accepted by chemists. As a welcome confirmation to
this came a determination of the specific heat of the metal by Professor EK. ReyNoLDs, f
who found that for its atomic heat to be near the normal number 6'0, its atomic weight
musb be 9'2 and not 13'8. Almost immediately afterwards a second determination of the
specific heat was made by MM. N11s0x and PerTERSON,$ who, however, obtained a
result agreeing not with the lower atomic weight but with the higher.

The reasons for these conflicting opinions are to be foundâ€”fbrst, in the anomalous
position of glucinum among the elements ; secondly, in the difficulties which gurround
the preparation of even small quantities of the free metal in a tolerably pure condi-
tion ; and thirdly, in the fact that no volatile compound of glucinum is known of which
the vapour density might be easily determined.

The constitution of the compounds of glucinum cannot be inferred from any physical or
chemical similarities with analogous compounds of other metals. Tts compounds most
closely resemble those of magnesium and aluminium, but also differ from these in the
most striking manner. None are isomorphous with any similar compounds of these
