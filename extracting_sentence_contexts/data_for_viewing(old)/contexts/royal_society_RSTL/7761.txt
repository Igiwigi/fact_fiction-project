ginal right leg of the fork, in the central part of the left-hand lip of the ventricular lit,
while its posterior portion passes off slantingly upwards into the termination of the
original left leg of the fork in the central part of the right-hand lip of the slit. Thus
a twisted hourglass-shaped aperture connects the two arterial infundibula, which
become separated by its gradual closure.

The left ventricular opening of the orifice in the septum, with the upper part of the
right yentricular opening, and the channel between them, remain permanently open,
and develope into the aortic infundibulum.

Conclusions.

The following are the most important new facts at which T have arrived :â€”

1. That in the heart of the common fowl the division of the truncus arteriosus into
the aorta and pulmonary artery does not take place by the formation of two longitudinal
oppoxitely situated ridges along the whole length of the vessel and their subsequent
growth together, as RaTuke states to occur in Reptiles, Birds, and Mammalia.

2. That this process of division of the truncus arteriosus is accurately described as

occurring by the gradual extension into it of the septum between the fourth and fifth
MDCCCLXIX. 3H
