The stability conditions are given by the spectrum G(T) of the matrix T. In fact —T is a Laplacian
matrix with spectrum

G(T) = {0,A2,..-,AN},

where the eigenvalue 0 corresponds to the direction 1=(1,...,1) along the group orbit of the
phase-shift symmetry. This means that stability of Qt + 6° is only determined by the eigenvalues
doy... AN:

Note that none of the eigenvalues A2,...,A) are equal to zero, i.e. zero is a simple eigenvalue
of T. Indeed, let H denote the graph of which adjacency matrix AB is defined by AH ik = Tk for

j#k. By condition (ii) we have All = =0 if and only if A= =0. This means that E(H) = E(H) and
