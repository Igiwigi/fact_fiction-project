required and of the need of very special vacuum vessels if an electro-magnet is to be
used for producing the magnetic fields. Some cryostat, preferably employing liquid
air as the cooling agent, was therefore necessary. It was decided to use the type of
cryostat described by Keyes and Youna,* as this seemed the most suitable for the present
purpose. In this cryostat a bath of pentane is cooled by liquid air in a surrounding
vacuum vessel and the temperature is maintained by making and breaking the current
in a heating coil, a constancy of temperature of one-hundredth of a degree being
obtainable with the modified arrangement here used. Since the outer diameter of the
outer vacuum vessel of the cryostat actually constructed for the present work is about
12 cms., it was out of the question to employ an electromagnet to produce the magnetic
fields. A large water-cooled coil capable of carrying a current of about 20 amps. was
therefore made for this purpose. A definite lower limit was set for the inner diameter
of the coil by the fact that the coil had to pass up round the cryostat, and the question
of ease of handling of the coil set a limit to the weight and hence to the outer diameter
and axial length of the coil, A design for the coil was therefore got out in the light of
these limitations, taking also into account the necessity for H dH/dx being as great
as possible. The coil was very carefully and accurately constructed and its dimensions
