Tye following researches originated from some experiments which were
undertaken to discover an improved method for ascertaining the quantity of nitrate
of potassa existing in crude saltpetre. After several unsuccessful attempts the action
of hydrochloric acid was tried. The fact, that nitrates are decomposed by this acid,
has been long known; but the nature of the resulting compound of potassium has
not, 80 far as I am aware, been hitherto determined. LI anticipated that the nitrate
would be decomposed into chloride of potassium. To decide the question some pure
nitrate of potassa was mixed with hydrochloric acid, and the mixture heated ; while
at common temperatures no perceptible action occurs, but immediately the acid be-
comes hot, decomposition commences.
