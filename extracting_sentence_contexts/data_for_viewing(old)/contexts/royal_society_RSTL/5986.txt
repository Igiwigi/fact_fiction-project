commissure of the cotyledons, and presents in its upper part two irregular lobes,
ing opposite to each other and decussating with the cotyledons (f). These are
by TrEcUuL as the primordial leaves.

In germination the hard seed-coat is opened by the separation of a little lid or cap at 1
point opposite the radicle, and from the orifice thus formed emerges the sprouting struc- 1
tures of the young plant. In the accounts generally given, it is stated that the cotyledons
remain in the seed, and the radicle and plumule emerge together, the latter elongating i
into a kind of stalk between the cotyledons and the first leaf. I cannot reconcile this
account with the facts which I have met with. The cotyledons certainly remain within |
the seed-coats, and, as it appeared to me, s800n undergo decompoxsition ; but IT believe
that, in addition to this, the first leaf of the plumule (the larger of the two lobes visible
in the embryo (fig. 21 F') previously to germination) also remains within the seed-coats. -
In the specimen I examined the radicle had elongated but slightly, pushing off the lid or -
operculum, which remained sticking upon its extremity (figs. 237, 24 A, 25, 0); at the -
side of the radicle emerged a stalk-like process (fig. 25, #1), which at a little distance
from the sced exhibited a blunt lateral protuberance (fig. 25 81), and there became bent
at right angles; beyond the bend a long stalk-like portion succeeded (# 2), at the end of
which the regular stem with undeveloped internodes commenced its growth (fig. 22),
On extracting the germinating plant from the seed-coats (fig. 24), the stalk-like proces
coming out at the side of the radicle was found to arise side by side with the radicle
from a fleshy mass (fig. 25 pt), which appears to be the plumule, and not the cotyledons,
