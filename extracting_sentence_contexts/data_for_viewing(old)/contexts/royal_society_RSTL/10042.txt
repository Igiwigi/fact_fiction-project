Atropin applied to the sinus and auricles only, slows the rhythm both of auricles
and ventricle, With this slowing it causes the ventricle to beat, synchronously with

the auricles, if it has previously been beating with half-rhythm, and increases the
strength of the contractions both of auricles and ventricle. Also as long as the auricles
are beating, the ventricle beats synchronously with them. From these facts I conclude
that atropin 8lows the rate of the discharges from the motor ganglia without making
them weaker; with the slower rate the impulses are therefore stronger than before,
and the contractions must also be stronger, up to a certain extent, of slowing, because
with a certain slow rate of rhythm the maximum contractions of the heart are obtained.
Whether the strevgth of the impulses is absolutely increased apart from the presumably
beneficial effects of the slower rate I cannot say positively, though I am inclined to
Q think they may be, as in some cases it has seemed to me that after atropin has been
given it is necessary to screw the clamp up tighter than usual in order to cause the
i] ventricle to remain quiescent.
