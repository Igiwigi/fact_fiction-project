& i is evident that when cos@ is put equal to zero after the differentiation, only the
Serms i in V which do not contain cosé@ will contribute any result to Y and Z. But
e above equation shows also that these terms always contain sind, so that at
uatorial stations Y and Z change sign in passing from summer to winter.
Gables XI. and XIII. corroborate this sufficiently well, especially when it is
remembered that the stations are not quite equatorial, and that the obliquity of the
magnetic axis also produces a disturbing effect. A further interesting consequence
of the above equations is to indicate that at the equator the terms in X which
depend on sind, 7.e., the seasonal terms in the horizontal force variation, vanish.
This agrees with the known fact that at tropical stations the X variation hardly
changes throughout the year. Table XII. illustrates this, especially for the most
nearly equatorial observatory, Batavia (6° S.).
For comparison with observation we shall write down the values of the ratios
of the amplitudes of the first, third, and fourth harmonic components to that of the

second; for X we take the mean value of cosd in our equations, and neglect the
seasonal changes; for Y and Z the terms in cos @ and sind are taken separately.
The values of the amplitudes of the second component in the several cases are
