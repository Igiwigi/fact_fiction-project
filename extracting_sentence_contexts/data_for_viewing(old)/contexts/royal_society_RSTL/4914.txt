mammiferons ovum, but confine myself to a few remarks.

Dr. Marmix Barsy says, © On one occasion, in an ovum of 5+ hours, I saw in the
orifice of the membrane” (the external membrane of the ovum) © an object very
much resembling a spermatozoon which had increased in size . .. I am not prepared
to say that this was certainly a spermatozoon, but it seems proper to record the
observation.”

Now, whether we believe Dr. Barry to have really seen the penetration of the
spermatozoon into the mamrmiferous oyvum, or whether we agree with Biscnory and
most other distinguished authors, and deny the correctness of Dr. Barry's observa-
tion, as well as the possibility of any such occurrence, the present investigations
appear to be the first in which the fact of the penetration of spermatozoa into the
ovum has been distinctly seen and clearly established, in one of the most highly
organized of the entozoa.

The accuracy of these obseryations is satisfactorily borne out, and will be more
readily admitted, as we continue to trace the progress of the ovule, the changes of
the spermatic particles, and the development of the oyum.

The accompanying drawings present these appearances as exactly as possible,
being taken originally from actual specimens, by means of a camera lucida. In
some we find the broken margin of s8mall extent (figs. 58, 60 c); in others it embraces
nearly one half of the circuinference (fig. 59 c). Some give a faint indication of the
contained germinal vesicle (fig. 60 b); but in most the granules are too opake to
