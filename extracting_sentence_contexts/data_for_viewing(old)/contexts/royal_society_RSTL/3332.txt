riably been sacrificed. For instance, to avoid the brittleness of the best speculum
metal, it had been found necessary, as the dimensions were increased, to use an in-
creased proportion of copper, 80 that the alloy was inferior in brillianey, yellower, and
much more liable to tarnish*. In polishing large surfaces also there were great and
peculiar difficulties, all the defects having a tendeney to augment rapidly with the
size, and proportionately to impair the defining power. I thought, therefore, that were
it possible to discover means of securing, in the construction of large instruments, the
same excellence of material and accuracy of surface, which on a small scale was at-
tainable hy the processes already published, much would be gained; but even in the
construction of small instruments there was no reason to suppose that the utmost
limits of perfection had already been attained. On the contrary, the unequal per-
formance of specula wrought with the utmost skill by the same hand, and with the
same materials, was a fact which clearly proved that certainty of effect, the usual cha-
racteristic of a perfect mechanical operation, was still to be 8ought for. It was evi-
dent, therefore, that there was ample room for experiment with a prospect of some
suecess. With these views, the first experiments were undertaken : they were on a
small scale, the earliest as far back as 1827, and some account of them appeared at.
the time in Sir David BrxewsTER's Journal for July 1828. Since that time, the scale
was gradually increased, till an aperture of three feet was attained, beyond which as
yet I have not proceeded.

I should, perhaps, however, remark here, that although these experiments were ex-
ceedingly numerous, they were not near s0 tedious as might be supposed from the
length of time that has elapsed since their commencement ; for in the midst of other
avocations, long interruptions occurred, s0 that probably more might have been ac-
