The rigorous study of quantum field theories is a very hard problem and has
been slow in development, even for theories much simpler than those that impact
on geometry. Even though quantum field theory is used in physics every day, the

mathematical foundations underlying the standard model of particle physics still
have to be constructed. Even the rigorous treatment of pure quantum Yang-Mills
heory without matter is still open and, in fact, is one of the seven Millennium
Prize Problems of the Clay Mathematics Institute (Carlson et al. 2006).

So, instead of reverting to the origins of these new ideas, mathematicians are
now developing their own axiomatic versions, in particular of topological quantum
field theories, to suit their own ends. This is not unusual in mathematicsâ€”instead
of asking what the real numbers really are, we are happier to characterize them
vy their properties, which we can use on an everyday basis.

This mathematical approach has uncovered a rich structure. For example, a

opological quantum field theory requires a hierarchy of concepts, the lower levels
