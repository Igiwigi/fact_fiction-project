on the foot and hand of Macacus rhesus and sinicus. I find the results much less
open to individual variation than in the experiments upon the spinal nerve-roots
innervating the same region. The figures illustrate the areas of anesthesia obtained
by section of the musculo-cutaneous and anterior tibial nerves, combined on the one

side with section of the both plantar nerves, on the other with section of the
external plantar only. It will be noted that the field of the internal saphenous
nerve in the Monkey reaches along the tibial and dorsal aspect of the hallux very

nearly to the tip of that digit. This is in agreement with the fact that, aa shown
in my previous paper, the Vth lumbar of Macacus rhesus has a skin-field which runs
down upon that aspect of the hallux, 1 ;
In Macacus the nerve seems to descend further along the hallux than it does ie
Man. It is true that in Frower’s ‘ Diagrams of the Nerves of the Human Body
(1881), the area of the internal saphenous nerve is given along the tibial aspect
of the hallux, very nearly if not quite as far as terminal phalanx, and this although
no overlapping at all is indicated, In THanr’s more careful figure of the cutaneous
