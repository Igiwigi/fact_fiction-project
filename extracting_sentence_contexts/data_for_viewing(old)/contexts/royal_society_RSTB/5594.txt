ness of this view. We are not inclined to accept RossENBECK’s suggestion that these
bands are developed from the “completion plate,” a suggestion which implies the
derivation of the cranial and intermediate region of the head-process from this same
plate.

Finally, arising out of the comparison of the reconstructions of the dorsal views of
the human embryos provided in this paper, we may call attention to the possibility
of the existence of two different varieties of embryonal shield : one narrow (text-figs. 4,
5, 7, 8 and 10), the other broader (text-figs. 3, 6and 9). If we compare Srieve’s embryo
(text-fig. 3) with embryo Bi24 (text-fig. 4), we notice that the former is slightly longer,
but very much broader than the latter, at the same time Bi24 is certainly more
differentiated. Again, if we compare Waupryer’s embryo with the Dobbin embryo,
we observe the same fact: the length of both is practically the same, but the former
is much broader than the latter, and the head-process is certainly much less developed.
Again, if we compare the Dobbin embryo with RosseNnBECK’s specimen, we see only a
slight difference in the differentiation of the axial structures, but a very marked
difference in size, especially in breadth. These observations suggest that there may
be two different forms of the human embryonal area: one small and comparatively
narrow (what we may call a dwarf form), the other large and comparatively broad
(what we may call a giant form). In this connection it is of interest to recall that two
varieties of embryonal area are distinguishable in the rabbit, one in which the embryonal
area is short and broad, the other in which it is long and narrow (cf. the figures of VAN

BENEDEN and Rast).
