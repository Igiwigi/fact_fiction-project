would have been chemically impossible to arrive at truth in
analysis. There were already real difficulties enough to be over-
come; and Mr. BERTHOLLET has lately discovered some, which
are not 80 easily answered as those I have just considered. The
position of this chemist, however, has been too generally ex-
tended by him. If the power of masses were as great as he
represents it to be, and if it increased ad infinitum, in proportion
to the mass, it must follow, that, with any given substance, we
could decompose any compound, provided the mass of the
decompounding body were sufficiently great; but this is well
known not to be the case.

* SCHEELE was, in fact, the first who perceived this affinity. See his E55ay on Silez,
Clay, and Alumina.

From the experiments which I have related, it appears to be
proved.
