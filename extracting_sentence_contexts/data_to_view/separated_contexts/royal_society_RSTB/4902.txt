level in the “ whites” than in the “ natives” of the high plateau. The true explanation
of this fact will likely be found in the relatively greater antero-posterior diameter of
the thorax of the natives. It will be noted (see the figure), that the diaphragm holds the same relationship
to the subcostal plane in both “whites” and “natives”; the lower position of the
diaphragm in natives is due to the greater absolute slope of the ribs in them. Dr. Redfield has measured the slope of the dorsal segment of the eighth rib, and
shows definitely that this segment of the eighth rib is more horizontal—has less
slope—in the “natives” than in the “whites.”
