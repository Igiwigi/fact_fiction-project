For the three standard conditions we can therefore use:

(1) Standard normal condition:

kiy = bw = nsiny?

==} k,, is a number like 2; kp, =0.
*siny’ 4 ae a


GENERAL MOTION OF THE AEROPLANE 313

(II) Standard diving condition:

k,,, is infinite. In fact, however, k,,, always occurs with the factor cosy which is
zero. Now
ky COs nt_,

po 1 kp; sin wy

: : k,(i_,) :
cos yk,,, = siny cot yncot ni 7 sin FG; es y = Msn yf

and as i_, > 0 so that y ~ 41, this quantity tends to the limit nk,./kp, a number like
80 or 100 for any conventional aeroplane.

kp, is, on our hypothesis, zero at i
machine.

k,., like k,,,, is infinite; but, like f;,,,
cos yk,, can be written z,/kp, and this is a number like 15 or 20 at standard diving
incidence.

_» = 0; it is in fact quite negligible for an actual

it occurs only in combination with cosy. Now

kp, is ignored.
(LIT) Standard stalled condition:

reps en is very small; kp, = 0. We now proceed to consider the numerical values of «, A, 7, s’ for ordinary aeroplanes.
