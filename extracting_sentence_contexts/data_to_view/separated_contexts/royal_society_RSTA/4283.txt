The resulting performance is surely deteriorated, with
a dark current density two orders of magnitude larger and a significantly lower shunt resistance
(typically smaller than 1 MQ). When it comes to the molecular targets, the mid-infrared region, usually referred to as
‘molecular fingerprint’ region, surely offers a number of interesting possibilities. In fact, many
molecules exhibit strong and narrow rotation—vibration transitions at wavelengths larger than
31m. It is not by chance that the first DBT experiment was performed on ammonia at 10.35 jum. NHg is a pyramidal molecule (symmetry C3y) with three identical N—-H bonds, showing four
fundamental vibrations: the symmetric stretch (vj), the symmetric bend (v2), the degenerate
antisymmetric stretch (v3) and the degenerate antisymmetric bend (v4).
