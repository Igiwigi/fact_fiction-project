the firs method gives a result which should be fairly accurate though it omits Â« from
the thermograph.

If H be taken as known, and if the fiducial line yy y be correct, the limit of the
spectrum would be beyond e; but it is hard to reconeile this with the fact that the
centre of the last red image of the sun seen through cobalt glass would be near (!
otherwise the absorptions shown in the photograph would agree with the breaks of
continuity in the thermograph.

Theoretical deductions.

It has seemed advisable to keep any theoretical deductions to the concluding portion
of this paper, as the first portion contains wholly facts on which no controversy, I can
imagine, can arise ; at the same time, it would be wanting in candour did I not point
out what seems to me to be some evident conclusions which can be drawn from the
experiments that I have made over such a long period.

IT have pointed out that the form of silver bromide which is sensitive to the red and
ultra-red of the spectrum transmits the least refrangible rays to a marked extent, but
it does nob do 80 entirely ; in fact, we may ay it absorbs all rays, the less refrangible
the best, the more refrangible mach less, and the green rays leasb of all. A very
instructive experiment to repeat is to photograph the spectrum of burning coal-gas
with this 8alt. It will be found that the curve of intensity constructed as already
indicated has the following appearance in he prismatic spectrum.
