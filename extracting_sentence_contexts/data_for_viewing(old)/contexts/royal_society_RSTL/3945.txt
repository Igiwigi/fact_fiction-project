E The formation of this snbstance has been already described. It is sparingly soluble
ly in cold, but very soluble in hot water; from which it is again deposited in colourless
5 crystals, often an inch in length. They are anhydrous, decrepitate when heated, and
BD bear a temperature of 190* without being changed.

= The form belongs to the oblique prismatic system, which is in
z fact nothing more than a hemihedral form of the right prismatic
