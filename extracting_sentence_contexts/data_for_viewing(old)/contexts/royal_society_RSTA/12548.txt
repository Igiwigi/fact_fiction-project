Hence the presence of this term would make Q infinite at the axis, where
0=a=th /(l—p.1—/¢).

These expressions, in fact, tell us that where we may have 1 — g? = 0, the terms
of y that involve p, must contain the factor 1 —g*, and vice versd. The loci to
which these values correspond are given on p. 478. They are, namely, for

Ovary spheroid and hyperboloid of two sheets :—
p=lonaxis; at infinity.
= 1 onaxis; 0 at plane of symmefry.
Planetary spheroid and hyperboloid of one sheet :—
p = 0 within ring of foci; io at infinity.
q = 1 on axis; 0 on plane of symmetry beyond focal circle.
