and the lower portion as that, in which the formation of chyle
is compleated. This receives further confirmation from a
more attentive examination of the parts, immediately after
death, by which it was found that before the stomach has been
disturbed there is an evident muscular contraction between
the plicated and lower portion. This appearance was met with
in every -instance that was examined, and these were not fewer
than nine or ten. Added to this the lower portion, on a more
minute inspection, has an appearance somewhat similar.to the
inner membrane of the human stomach : and the surface of
the plice is in many respects different.

From the facts and observations which have been stated, it
appears that in many animals of the class Mammalia, the food
undergoes different changes preparatory to its being con--
verted into chyle, and this last process is effected by a some-
what similar secretion, since the part of the stomach which
produces it, has in all of them an evident similarity of
structure.

The above facts appear to throw some light on the diges-
tion of the different kinds of food, and open a wide field of
enquiry into one of the most interesting parts of the animal
ceconomy, which has been hitherto too much neglected. In
the present very limited state of our knowledge there are
