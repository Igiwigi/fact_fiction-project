Evidently, ECHAM6-
FESOM simulates substantial Arctic sea ice variability throughout the year across a wide range
of timescales. This appears to be rather consistent with observations and is discussed in more
detail in Sidorenko et al. [34] and especially by Rackow et al. [42]. The Arctic sea ice volume in
the uncoupled set-up STOCH_UNCPL is highly correlated to that of REF owing to the fact that
the sea ice has experienced effectively the same atmospheric forcing. However, STOCH_UNCPL
shows a clear increase in Arctic sea ice volume when compared to REF (figure 1, (i)). The first 20-â€”
30 years can be seen as a transient phase during which Arctic sea ice volume builds up slowly.
