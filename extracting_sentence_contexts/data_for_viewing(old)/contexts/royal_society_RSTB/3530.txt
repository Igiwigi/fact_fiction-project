the fundamental agreement of organisation in the two cases. We possess a parallel
series of photomicrographs to those in figs. 29-33, but from motives of economy
we reproduce only one (fig. 34, Plate 7), taken a short distance behind the mouth
of the blastopore, and illustrating the quasi-independence of the knot-tissue from
its environment. At the extreme posterior limit it is less easy than in Specimen P

to differentiate the cellular mass of the knot from the cellular tissue of the anterior
end of the primitive streak. Nevertheless, the posterior contour of the knot visible
in the schematic text-fig. 11, is not merely conjectural, though it is less distinct than
in Specimen P. The distinction, in fact, persists until a still later stage of
development. Text-fig. 12 represents a mesial-plane-reconstruction similar to
