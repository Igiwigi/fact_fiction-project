This has paved the way to a phenomenological picture of MBL 2

systems known as ‘local integrals of motion’ [5,6], which was rigorously proven (under certain
physically reasonable assumptions) by Imbrie [7]. These efforts have led to a rather complete
theoretical understanding of MBL phases and their unique properties (such as the logarithmic
spreading of entanglement in a global quench [8]) in one-dimensional, strongly-disordered
interacting models.

3. Experiments

One of the main challenges lies in the fact that an MBL system can only be stable in perfect
isolation from any thermal environment, since otherwise the environment will, in the long
term, always thermalize the system. The main experimental workhorses for studying many-
body localization have been synthetic many-body systems such as ultracold atoms [9] and
trapped ions [10], which are naturally well isolated from the environment. While trapped ion
systems are intrinsically limited in system size, and cold atoms in optical lattices only allow
for limited observation time, these systems could nonetheless demonstrate many fundamental
aspects of many-body localization, in particular the local memory of the system’s initial condition.
