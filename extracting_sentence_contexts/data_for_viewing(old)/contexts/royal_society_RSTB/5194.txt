been figured by T'uressen (4) and described by him as common in Paleozoic coals,
and as being ‘“‘ woody tissue showing bands similar to those of annual growth rings.”

Prof. G, H1ckiine (5) gives a very fine coloured plate of a lenticle from the Yard
Coal, Wallsend Colliery, which is very similar to the one now under consideration. He
describes it as part of the Myeloxylon cortex of a Medullosa. This cortex is, however,

of the “ Sparganum” type, consisting of parallel plates of sclerenchyma, which do not
anastomose as in the Dictyoxylon type found in Lyginopteris. All such cortex of pterido-
sperms is, however, excluded from consideration by the fact that, both in H1cki1ne’s
specimen and in ours, the thick-walled tissue is seriated and is periderm, whereas in
the pteridosperms it is primary unseriated cortex.

The arrangement of the fibrous strands in the “ cortex band” clearly points to a
distorted and fractured Dictyoaylon periderm. A cortex of the “ Sparganum” type,
consisting of parallel radial plates, could be folded by compression, but would not show
the anastomosis presented by our specimen. In fig. 13 (No. 163) we see two nearly
perfect meshes, and approximations to this condition are not rare (fig. 7) (No. 300). A
common appearance, however, is that of concentric arcs as in fig. 12 (No. 210).

To interpret the macroscopic appearance we require to know the effect of pressure
upon such a structure as a Dictyoxylon cortex, This is less readily observed in petrifac-
