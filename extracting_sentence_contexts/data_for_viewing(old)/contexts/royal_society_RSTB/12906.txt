within species. Instead, we see systematic covariation between
the within-species temperature-dependence and the tempera-
tures in which these species occur. Interestingly, this same
temperature-dependence of temperature-dependent develop-
ment has recently been detected in terrestrial and freshwater

ectotherms [29] and similar patterns have also been noted in
trematodes [48]. Finally, the temperature-dependence of the
metabolic rate also seems to be temperature-dependent in
ectothermsâ€”species living in warmer temperature tend to
have metabolic rates that are less affected by changes in temp-
erature than species living in cooler temperatures [29]. The
fact that these patterns are repeated across a wide variety of
taxa and at least two key rates (development and metabolic)
implies that there is some common factor that drives the evol-
ution of different temperature dependencies according to the
local thermal regime and deserves much more exploration.
For now, we are at a loss to explain this pattern. Nevertheless,
finding that cold-water species have much greater tempera-
ture dependencies than warmer water species has critical
implications for how future climate change will affect
developmental durations and dispersal potentials in the sea.
