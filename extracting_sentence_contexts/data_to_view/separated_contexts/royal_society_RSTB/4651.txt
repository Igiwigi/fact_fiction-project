G. RIDEWOOD ON THE CALCIFICATION OF THE

remnant of the membrana elastica externa and a flattened cartilage-cell, but as a rule
the latter differs from the former in being surrounded by a clear space, owing to the
shrinkage of the cell within the lacunar space in the matrix which it previously filled. There is no occasion to be discouraged by the fact that in some particular section the
remnants of the membrane cannot be recognised; it not uncommonly happens, in
Scyliorhinus canicula, for instance, that such remains are to be seen in one vertebra
and not in that which immediately follows. Large vertebrae, those more than 10 mm. in diameter, were cut with a very fine
saw (dentistâ€™s ribbon-saw, with 25 teeth to the centimetre), and the thin slice was
then ground under water upon a carborundum stone, and finished upon a razor-hone
or water-of-Ayr stone. When thin enough to be transparent, the section was stained
and mounted exactly like a section cut by the paraffin method.
