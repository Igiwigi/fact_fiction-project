ON THE MAMMALIAN NERVOUS SYSTEM. 501

Averaging all the observations together, we find that the excitatory effect observed
in the nerve, when the uncut root was excited, amounted to 237 scale, whereas that
evoked by stimulating the peripheral end was 152 scale. The reduction amounts
roughly to about 30 per cent. of the original value, and is especially marked only in the

case of the posterior roots. This fact led us, at first, to believe that when a posterior
root was excited in its continuity, the spinal centre being of necessity aroused, there
must be a flow of energy from the latter down the root, and that this would provide
the greater effect noted. This view, however, was materially shaken by the small
amount of the reflex discharge obtainable from a nerve centre. We, therefore, regard

the phenomenon from the more general point of view expressed above until further i

research shall make the question clearer.
