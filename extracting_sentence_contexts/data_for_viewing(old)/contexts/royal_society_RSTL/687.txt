to be established in the course of the prevailing winds. If
the wind be from a cold quarter, the temperature of this cur-
rent is comparatively low, and vice vers. This fact is mani-
fest in the effect of the gales we experienced between the
7th and 12th of April, during which time, being south of the


286 Dr. Davy's observations on the

equator, and the wind blowing from the south, the tempera-
ture of the sea was considerably reduced.

Where the sea is shallow, it is now a well established fact,*
that the temperature of the water is comparatively low ; an
important circumstance, highly deserving the attention of the
practical navigator; it may forewarn him of a bank in the
darkness of night, when nothing else would indicate it, and
put him on his guard when approaching low shores and shal-
lows, time enough to avoid their dangers. In advancing to
wards the Cape of Good Hope, and in doubling that pro-
montory, and in making Ceylon, I collected some observations
on this subject, the results of which I shall now introduce.
On making Table-bay, before land was to be seen, there was
a decided fall of the temperature of the water, viz. from above
