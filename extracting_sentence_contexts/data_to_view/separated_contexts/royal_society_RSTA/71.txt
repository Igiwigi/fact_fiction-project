Let us mention that in higher dimensions, for a quadratic c and a logarithmic f, finding an
equilibrium amounts to solve the following Monge-Ampére equation, see [11, section 4.3]:

(0) = det(D?u(0)) exp (-Fivmoy? +0-Vu(0) — 0)

x exp (- [,, ecru, vate dui). 6.4)

Figure 1. The convergence to the distribution of actions v at equilibrium in the case of f(v) = v* with w = 2on the (a) and
at = 5on the (b). Here, p(x, y) = 10(2x — y — 0.4), c(6,x) = |9 — x|*/4 and jv is uniform on (0, 1]. (Online version in

(b) Variational approach
In [11], we observe that whenever V takes the form (5.2) with a symmetric kernel ¢ then it is the
first variation of the energy

We can thus prove that the condition defining equilibria is in fact the Euler-Lagrange equation
for the variational problem

inf (We(u,v) + J(v)}. (5.5)
veP(X)

Mote precisely, if v solves (5.5) and y € I7p(u,v), then y actually is a Cournot—Nash equilibrium. Not only this approach gives new existence results, but also, and more surprisingly, uniqueness
in some cases, because the functional above may have hidden convexity properties. It is worth
noting that in the quadratic cost case variational problems of the form (5.5) play a key role in
the theory of gradient flows in the Wasserstein space of probability measures, see [14] for a
detailed exposition of this powerful theory, in which it appears as one step of the celebrated
Jordan-Kinderleherer—Otto [15] scheme.
