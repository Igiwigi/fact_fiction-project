Since the effective action of the bare theory must equal that of the renormalized theory (in
whatever renormalization scheme), we must have pa + Vzpr = pa(H) + Vzpe(), and hence the
-dependency must cancel on the r.h.s. The MS-renormalized one-loop result therefore reads

which is perfectly finite. As previously warned, this does not necessarily mean that the obtained
expression is a physical result, but at least is a meaningful, finite, expression. As it is well known
from renormalization theory [114], the price for the finiteness of any renormalized result is its
necessary dependence on an arbitrary mass scale, jz in this case. In point of fact, this is the
essence of the RG [114-116]. However, as noted before, scale dependencies (including explicit and
implicit) must cancel out in the full effective action of the theory since by construction we started
from the bare theory, which is of course jz-independent (RG-invariant). Therefore, explicit changes
of (within a given renormalization scheme) in one sector of the theory must be compensated


by explicit and/or implicit changes of in another sector (e.g. from the implicit running of
the couplings and fields). Thus, even though both pieces, the renormalized ZPE (2.10) and the
renormalized parameter p,(j) separately depend on the renormalization scale j, the sum
