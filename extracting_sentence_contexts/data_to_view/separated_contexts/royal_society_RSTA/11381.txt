There does not, however, so far as one can

from hot metals have about the same power as the positive ions produced by Réntgen
rays in air of producing other ions by collisions, and that the other ions so produced
consist, in any given case, of an ordinary positive ion together with a corpuscle.

§$ 4. Hysteretic Relations between Current and Electromotive Force. The numbers given in Table 4, § 3, exemplify the curious fact that in some cases the
current increased with diminishing potential difference. The case cited was not
found to be an isolated instance, as the following numbers, obtained at a temperature
of 826° C. and a pressure of 074 millim., testify :—
