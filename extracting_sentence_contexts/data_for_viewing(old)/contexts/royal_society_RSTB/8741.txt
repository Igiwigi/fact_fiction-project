esis of a common response of all species to climate-induced
changes in temperature should also be tested when climate-
induced trophic cascades are hypothesized [49]. Kirby &
Beaugrand [48] proposed the term trophic amplification,
when climate-induced temperature changes have a signifi-
cant influence on each species, and that this influence is also
exacerbated through the trophic food web.

Other mechanisms have been proposed to explain
observed regime shifts in some exploited marine ecosystems
[52]. These hypotheses generally invoke fishing, which may
unbalance species interactions and lead to persistent ecosys-
tem changes. The prey-to-predator loop is based on the fact
that many prey feed on the eggs or larval stages of their
predators [52]. When the predator declines because of an
external force such as fishing, this can lead to the outbreak of
its prey, which may in turn prevent the recovery of the predator
because of predation pressure at the egg or larval stage. A key
assumption here is the reduction of the predator by fishing.
Note that this hypothesis may also hold if the predator has
been affected by adverse environmental conditions. The pred-
ator pit loop is a hypothesis that is based on the empirical
observation that two opposite states seem to occur for forage
(prey) fish population, one characterized by a low abundance
(refuge) and another characterized by outbreak abundance
