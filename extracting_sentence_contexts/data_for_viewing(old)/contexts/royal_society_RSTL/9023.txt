I tried the effect of a powerful filter upon those particles, and found that they passed
sensibly unimpeded through forty layers of the best filtering-paper®.

The liquid containing them was examined by a microscope magnifying 1200 dia-
meters. The suspended mastic particles entirely eluded this power, the medium
in which they swam being as uniform as distilled water in which no mastic whateyer
had been precipitated.

The optical deportment of the floating matter of the air proves it to be composed, in
part, of particles of this excessively minute character. The concentrated beam reveals
them collectively, long after the microscope has ceased to distinguish them individually.
"They are, moreover, organic particles, which may be removed from the air by combustion.
In presence of such facts, any argument against atmospheric germs, based upon their
being beyond the reach of the microscope, loses all validity.

We are here brought face to face with a question of extreme importance, which it
will be useful to clear up. © Potential germs” and © hypothetical germs” have been
spoken of with scorn, because the evidence of the microscope as to their existence was
not forthcoming. Sagacious writers had drawn from their experiments the perfectly
legitimate inference that in many cases the germs exist, though the microscope fails to
reveal them. Such inferences, however, have been treated as the pure work of the
imagination, resting, it was alleged, on no real basis of fact. But in the concentrated
beam we possess what is virtually a new instrument, exceeding the microscope indefi-
nitely in power. Directing it upon media which refuse to give the coarser instrument
any information as to what they hold in suspension, these media declare themselyes to
