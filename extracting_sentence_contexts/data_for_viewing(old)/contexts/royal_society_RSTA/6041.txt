absorption-contrast CT scans are both faster (c. 10min for CT versus 45-60 min for MRI) and
cheaper than MRIs, and X-ray methods are still the preferred option for visualizing bone and
vasculature (albeit to a lesser extent). MRI is also contraindicated for specific patient groups
(e.g. patients with implants or medical devices) and can be less tolerable for those prone to
claustrophobia.

The prelude to any such clinical application of XDS-CT techniques is thus the demonstration
of its feasibility in imaging mammalian tissue and biomaterials, a term that is broadly defined as
a material (either naturally occurring or synthetic) engineered to interact with biological systems
in a therapeutic or diagnostic manner. Biomaterials with an inorganic component such as bone
and dentin [142] have been favoured in proof-of-concept studies, but successful experiments have
also been performed in soft tissue. It is argued that the lack of broader medical interest is partially
attributed to the fact that despite frequently being touted as a non-destructive three-dimensional
imaging method, XDS-CT methods are not truly non-destructive in the case of biological samples,
which are generally subject to excision and extensive sample preparation prior to imaging. To :
date, the majority of XDS-CT studies focus on technique validation for a particular class of :3
samples. Uptake of DS-CT in biomedical communities will likely benefit from studies that move 1p
beyond proof-of-concept and instead demonstrate novel biomedical insight, with some examples ZR
including mechanistic understanding of disease processes or preliminary intervention studies. are
