example, the luminous rays, but the dark rays of the swn which s8weep the 8nows of
winter from the slopes of the Alps. Every glacier stream that rushes through the
Alpine valleys is almost wholly the product of invisible radiation. It is also the
invisible solar rays which lift the glaciers from the sca-level to the summits of the
mountains ; for the luminous rays penetrate the tropical ocean to great depths, while
the non-luminous ones are absorbed close to the surface, and become the main agents in
evaporation,

It is often stated, without limitation, that ether might be exposed at the focus of a
concave mirror without being sensibly heated; but this can only be true of a sifted
beam. At the focus of the electric lamp, not only ether, but alcohol and water are
speedily caused to boil, while bisulphide of carbon, whose boiling-point is only 48? C.,
cannot be raised to ebullition. In fact exposure for a period sufficient to boil alcohol
or water is scarcely sufficient to render bisulphide of carbon sensibly warm.

If any one point came out with more clearness than any other in my experiments on
gases, liquids, and yapours, it was the paramount influence which chemical constitution
exerted upon the phenomena of radiation and absorption. And seeing how little the
character of the radiation was affected by the change of a body from the state of vapour
to the state of liquid, I held it to be exceedingly probable that even in the solid state
chemical constitution would exert its power. But opposed to this conclusion we had
the experiments of MELLON on chalk and lampblack, and the far more extensive ones
of Mass0N and CouRTEEPEE on powders, which seemed clearly to show that in a state of
extremely fine division, as in chemical precipitates, the radiant and absorbent powers of
all bodies are the same. From these experiments it was inferred that the influence of
