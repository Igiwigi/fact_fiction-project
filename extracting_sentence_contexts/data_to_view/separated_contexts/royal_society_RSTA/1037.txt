Ay and therefore the proportional error is -- 1-4
parts in 10°, so that the estimated probable error of the mean value of refractive index
is + 0-000,000,014. The mean values of (u9 — 1) obtained from determinations of
Xy and Xy were 291-841 x 10~° and 291-861 x 107° respectively, so that the actual
difference was well within the estimated range of the probable error. Reference has already been made to the fact that the determinations in air were
generally accomplished with different samples of air. On two occasions, however,
observations were made by different observers on the same sample of air. Thus the
determinations XVII, XIX, and XXI of Xy, indicated by “ daggers” in Table XII,
were made in this manner, and it will be seen that they happen to cover a range very
