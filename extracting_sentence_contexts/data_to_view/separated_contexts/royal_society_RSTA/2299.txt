Thanks to this proposition, the quest for a global truth valuation becomes a much easier task. This, in turn, makes the problem of detecting disagreement significantly simpler. In fact, we can
reformulate it as an inference problem. Given a knowledgebase {¢1,...,@n}, it is sufficient to solve
the problem

(61 ® ... ® oy) (6.2)

for all 1<i<n. Then, the knowledgebase agrees globally if and only if the solution to each
problem is ¢;.

(c) Complete disagreement

Let $1, ¢2 € ® be two valuations of an adjoint information algebra ®, and let d(¢) = S, d(¢2) =T,
with SN T 4.
