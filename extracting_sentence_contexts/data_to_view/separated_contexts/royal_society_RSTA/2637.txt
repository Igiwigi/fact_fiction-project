After correcting the global trend, a striking anomaly emerged in the muon data, as shown in
figure 13. Comparison to the expected anomaly from simulation of the known deposit indicated
good overall agreement between data and expectation. Differences between the simulation and
data likely arise from the fact that the actual density distribution within the ore body is highly
variable, whereas in the simulation, the deposit is modelled as uniform density. Comparison of
the three-dimensional density inversion from muon data to the simulation is shown in figure 14.

4. Conclusion

Muon geotomgraphy was first envisioned as a tool for resource exploration and monitoring
by Malmgqvist [42] in the 1970s, and is only now being realized due to advances in charged
particle detector technology that allow for reliable and cost-effective measurements, as well as
low-power, fast computing to facilitate automated muon track reconstruction in remote sensors.
