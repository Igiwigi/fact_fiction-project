It follows that liberal and conservative ends of the political-worldview spectrum, and that part of

participant samples in Ecker and Ang may have differed the reason that evidence rejection has been predominantly


demonstrated in conservatives is that researchers have predo-
minantly looked at rejection of evidence that is consistent
with conservative worldviews. However, this presents future
research with a conundrum, because a number of studies
have now aimed but failed to find rejection of scientific evi-
dence on the left (e.g. [78-80]). For example, Lewandowsky
et al. [80] reported that vaccine-hesitancy and endorsement of
alternative medicine—both anecdotally associated with a lib-
eral worldview—were in fact more prevalent in right-wing
libertarians and conservatives. Based on additional evidence
from a task that required reasoning about scientific evidence
‘dilemmas’ that featured both worldview-consistent and
inconsistent aspects, Lewandowsky et al. concluded that parti-
sans on both ends of the spectrum show biased processing of
evidence, but that science denial was nevertheless a mainstay
of the political right. Future research, therefore, needs to shed
light on the catalysts that turn omnipresent information pro-
cessing biases into actual evidence rejection and science
denial.
