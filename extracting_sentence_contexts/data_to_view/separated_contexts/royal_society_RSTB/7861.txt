PERRY ON THE

80 cm a few days later, less than that of the smallest calf or the largest foetus in the present
series. Furthermore, although Dicksie was not weighed at the time, her first owner reports
that he could lift her clear of the ground, which indicated that she could not have been
much, if any, heavier than at birth. In fact, the estimate of 6 to 9 months was based on the
belief that the animal must have been born during the preceding dry season, and it has
already been shown that mating, and therefore calving, may occur at widely different
times of year. Thus this animal could not have been much over 9 years, and certainly
could not have reached 10 years of age, when measured in May 1949. The smallest, and
apparently the youngest, adult female in the present material (E147) was pregnant,
probably for the first time, and nearing mid-pregnancy.
