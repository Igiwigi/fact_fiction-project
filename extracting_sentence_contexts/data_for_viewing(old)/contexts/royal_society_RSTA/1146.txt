valley through it, which is forty or fifty miles long. At the entrance of the valley wait some ig
men who offer themselves to carry the baggage, if they are well paid. They use sticks to : a
drive the passengers on their journey; for any stoppage or rest would be fatal to the traveller, :2
in consequence of the irritation which the ammoniacal vapours of this valley produce on : S

the brain, and on account of the heat. The way becomes more and more narrow till the
travellers come to the end of their perilous passage. Here are pits with water, in which they
throw themselves, to obtain relief ... When travellers arrive in the Chinese territories, they
are beaten as in passing (to counteract the congestion of blood in the brain) (translated by
Sprenger [19], pp. 359-360).

Caution is needed with regard to the comment of al-Mas’tidi about effects of niishadir on the
brain. This may reflect the fact that the Chinese term, nao sha, includes a component referring to
the brain, so that nao sha was sometimes termed brain salt (see [20], pp. 446-447), for which there
are several possible explanations.

(b) Early ammonia science and philosophy

While the above examples illustrate the historic importance of ammonium in trade and air Dw
pollution, these were probably not the earliest applications. Pliny the Elder (Natural History 28: 19
19, 149) was already familiar with use of the fumes of deer horn and hair to make people breathe :8
naturally when choking with hysteria. This use is directly analogous to the eighteenth century 8
popularity of ammonium carbonate as ‘smelling salts’; these liberate gaseous NH3, which acts as :
a vasodilator in the airways. Ammonia and ammonium were also known in scientific circles, if
not always openly. In particular, they were at the heart of alchemy, well-known as a ‘reserved’
