{Sp
Jns examination of the phenomena of the flow of liquids through capillary tubes, as
-Srell as the discovery of the fact that chemical composition influenced the rate of flow,
:Were the work of M. PoIs8mIULLE,* who, in the paper referred to, gave the results of an
xtended series of carefully conducted experiments, illustrating the laws regulating
e rate of flow as affected by the length and diameter of the tube, the pressure acting
pon the liquid, and also, within a certain range, by the temperature. His work
Was carefully examined, in an experimental manner, by a commission of chemists and
Dhysicists, and found to be very exact.
