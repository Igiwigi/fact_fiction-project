' That urine does contain sulphur, not
in combination as sulphate, is evident from the smell of sulphuretted hydrogen which,
mixed with that of ammonia, is evolved from it whilst undergoing spontaneous decom- =
position, also from the blackening which white lead paint suffers when exposed to the
gases arising from putrid urine, and likewise from the fact, that urine allowed to putrefy
in a glass vessel containing oxide of lead as one of its contituents, permanently blackens
the glass. To set the fact beyond doubt, two portions of urine, previously deprived
of mucus by acetic acid and filtration, each consisting of four fluid ounces, were mea-
sured ; the one simply evaporated and burnt, the other eyaporated and afterwards de-
flagrated with nitre. Each portion was then dissolved in dilate nitric acid, leaving a
minute insoluble residue, and the sulphuric acid precipitated by chloride of barium;
the results were as follows :â€”
