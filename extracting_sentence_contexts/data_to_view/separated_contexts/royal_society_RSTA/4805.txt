Mazumdar 2014, personal communication). We therefore believe that the PA band in PDA film
that is formed in the sub-picosecond time domain originates from TT pairs, rather than from
isolated triplet excitons. It is worth mentioning that the lowest lying state in the TT manifold of
PDA is in fact the 2Ag, and therefore the picosecond PA dynamics unravels the internal conversion
1By > 2Ag [16]. The 2Ag dissociation into two separated triplets may occur at a longer time, and
being endothermic might need a defect on the polymer chain, such as chain twist for example. In conclusion, we investigated the singlet exciton fission process in both luminescent and
non-luminescent polymers using a variety of steady-state optical spectroscopies; most notably,
EXPA(q) spectroscopy and the MPA(B) technique.
