Figure 11. The optical gradient force versus the thickness of the waveguide core at a separation distance g = 200 nm and
refractive index n = 2.5 (Ao = 1.55 pum). (b, c) The mode profile corresponding to the last and the first simulation point in (a),
respectively. (Online version in colour.)

In figure 10a, we plot the optical force between two coupled slab waveguides as a function of
their separation distance. The highest forces are obtained for the smallest separation distances,
which is in agreement with the fact that the interaction between one waveguide and the
evanescent tails of the other waveguide is higher at small distances, as shown in figure 10b,c.
The force decays exponentially with increasing gap distances.

(iii) Discussion

The magnitude of the gradient forces between two slab waveguides depends strongly on the
geometric parameters and refractive indices of the waveguides (figures 10-12). In general, the
magnitude increases as the interaction between the evanescent tails and the waveguides becomes

stronger. The interaction strength is largest when the separation distance and the waveguide
thickness are small. Therefore, realistic set-ups, that aim for measurable displacements, typically
