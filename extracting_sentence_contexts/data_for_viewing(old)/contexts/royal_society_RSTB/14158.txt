too, such as shoulder shrugging with a cute face or rolling
eyes [123]. Addressee facial ‘displays’ can also serve the
grounding process, such as wincing in response to someone
describing a painful experience, or a facial expressions of con-

standing of the message (as well as empathy), and possibly
more unambiguously so than ‘generic listener responses’ (e.g.
‘mhm’, nods).

While gaze may not function as a grounding signal in
itself, the significance of visual signals for grounding is
underlined by the fact that speakers actively elicit them by
looking at the addressee, thus creating brief time windows
of mutual gaze during which the addressee responses occur
