In order to clarify the reasons for this behaviour, we considered the average
properties of the magnetic field in all three runs. The horizontal and temporal average of the vertical and horizontal components of the
magnetic field are displayed in figure 5. It shows that differences between the three models
are present only in the layers above the surface, in agreement with the fact that both Hall and
ambipolar effects are negligible in deep layers. This figure confirms what was already seen in
figure 3c,d, i.e. that the magnetic field is weaker in the upper layers of the AMBI run, and stronger
in the AMBIHALL run. Figure 5 demonstrates that this is true for both vertical and horizontal
magnetic field components.
