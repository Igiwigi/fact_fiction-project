WHEWELL ON THE EMPIRICAL LAWS

It is tolerably manifest that these sums decrease faster for the Jarge declinations
than for the small ones; and we shall probably see the law more clearly by referring
the correction to declination 0* than to the mean declination. For this purpose sub-
tract from each sum the correction for declination 0®, and we have

It appears that the numbers here are not yery remote from the ratio of the squares
of the sines of the declinations, In fact, if we take the formula — 3168 sin? 3, we
have

which may pass for a first approximation to the observed result, when it is considered
how much the errors are increased by addition. Dividing by 24, this gives — 132" 8in*8
for the correction to be applied to each result calculated for declination 0. When 3
is about 16*, the mean value, this correction is 11”, Hence 11” — 132" 8in*3 is the
correction to be applied to the mean yalue.
