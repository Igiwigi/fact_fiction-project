The FE displacement fields were extracted at corresponding nodal positions
including the edges of the sample. Then, sequences of deformed synthetic grid images have
been obtained by imposing the corresponding displacement fields on a reference image. The
procedure used for image deformation represents a critical stage in the simulation process due to
the fact that no numerical method is completely error free and in particular FE displacement fields
have to be interpolated onto imaginary pixel positions as discussed in [55,56] and can introduce
numerical errors that additionally influence the errors in the material parameters extracted with
the identification procedure. In the present work, sequences of deformed images were obtained
starting from a reference grid image simulating an acquisition of an ultra-high-speed camera. The reference grid image is obtained from an analytical description of a periodical grey-level
function using a pixel supersampling technique and down sampled to the desired resolution.
