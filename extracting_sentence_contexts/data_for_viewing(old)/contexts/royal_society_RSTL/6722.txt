equation, 7. e. from any solution of it involving a number of constants equal to the
number of the independent yariables, all the integrals of the dynamical equations can be
deduced by processes of differentiation. Hitherto, however, the discovery of the com-
plete primitive of a partial differential equation has been supposed to require a previous
knowledge of the integrals of a certain auxiliary system of ordinary differential equa-
tions; and in the case under consideration that auxiliary system consisted of the
dynamical equations themselyes. Jacopr's new methods do not require the preliminary
integration of the auxiliary system. They require, instead of this, the solution of
certain systems of simultaneous linear partial differential equations. 'To this object
therefore the method deyeloped in my recent paper on Simultaneous Differential Equa-
tions} might be applied. But the systems of equations in question are of a peculiar '
form. They admit, in consequence of this, of a peculiar analysis. And Jacopr's methods
of solving them are in fact different from the one given by me, though connected with
it by remarkable relations. He does indeed refer to the general problem of the solution j
of simultaneous partial differential equations, and this in language which does not even |
