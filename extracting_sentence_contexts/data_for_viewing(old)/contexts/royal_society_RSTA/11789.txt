fissures, the thickness equals 1 » to 5 p, or a mean thickness of 2°5 p. Generally speak-
ing the condition of these joints appears to be closely related to the mechanical
properties of the alloy (table, p. 418.).

Conclusions—We do not contest in any way, as our previous publications abund-
antly prove, the importance of the part which may be played in the mechanical
properties of the alloys by the residues which remain liquid after the main mass of
the alloy has solidified, the alloys being tested either at the ordinary temperature or
when heated. But, in order that it may be possible for such cements to intervene
and affect the mechanical properties of alloys, the cements must at least have a real
existence. Nothing indicates that they do exist in ten out of twelve of our alloys, but
we would not even express ourselves too positively on this point, for some new method
of etching may reveal new facts. The impurities which are sought for may happen to
concentrate themselves beyond the particular region which has been sectioned. These
are, however, for the present gratuitous suppositions. Polishing only indicates the
presence of cement in two cases. The little secondary crystals which we have already
described might readily be mistaken for cements of definite or indefinite composition
if they were found only in certain specimens and then in such proportions as could be
accepted, But we meet with them everywhere and in all cases their appearance is
constant in forms and dimensions, and moreover we see them collect into crystallites
which pervade the whole mass. These crystals are therefore usually and indubitably
due to the crystallization of gold itself, although the alloying substances sometimes
(indium and probably potassium) join up the crystals in question. For the same
reason the dark lines of the joints, traced as furrows by the etching, are very rarely
the empty tracks of cement which has been dissolved away by aqua regia; their
