|tr F| <2. (1.7)

It is remarkable that this algebraic condition (1.7) admits (under the asymptotic
assumptions stated at the outset) a physical interpretation of the centrifugal force
exceeding the gravitational force in the sense of (1.3). This is a symptom of a previously
hidden role of geometry in averaging theory. Some recent progress in exploring this
connection will be outlined in this brief survey.

Example. High frequency and small amplitude do not automatically guarantee stability:
stabilization must be strong enough to overcome the destabilization, in the sense of (1.3). As an
example, with! =1, g=1 anda=wsinaot (high acceleration, high frequency, small amplitude) the
condition (1.3) fails, and with it does stability, no matter how large w is: the centrifugal force of
the fictitious constraint in figure 1 is too weak to overcome gravity. Intuitively, the mean square
velocity v? is not high enough.

Let us, therefore, increase the acceleration (and thus the velocity), keeping the same
frequency—take, for instance, a = @°!? sin wt. The choice of power guarantees that the amplitude
is still small, namely w '/? (but not as small (w~!) as in the preceding example of instability; this
increase is unavoidable since we kept the frequency and increased the acceleration). The stability
criterion (1.3) now becomes

58 or w > 2gl.

Our heuristic discussion relied on the asymptotic assumption of high frequency and high
acceleration, and so an earlier remark applies here: this condition alone does not guarantee
