A number of metaphase plates from the first
division were measured and their diameters compared with a similar measurement of
those of the second. The average diameter of the metaphase plate in the first division
was 1-6 Â», while that of the second division was 0-8 wu. This fact was also clearly
brought out by a comparison of Plate 19, fig. 6, with Plate 19, fig. 8. We feel, therefore,
justified in maintaining that a meiosis does occur in the nuclear divisions prior to the
formation of spores, which have, therefore, the haploid chromosome number. The stages in the second division are essentially similar to those of the first division,
