Numerous experimental data on the rapid
solidification of eutectic systems exhibit the formation

One contabution or 15 to-a theme issue of metastable solid phases with the initial (nominal)

“Transport phenomena in complex systems chemical composition. This fact is explained by

diffusionless (chemically partitionless) solidification
Subject Areas: beginning at a high but finite growth velocity of
Materials science, mathematical modelling, crystals. In the present work, a model is suggested
thermodynamics for the diffusionless growth to analyse the atomic
