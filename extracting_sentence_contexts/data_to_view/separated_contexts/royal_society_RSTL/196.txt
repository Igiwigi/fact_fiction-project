Although the grinder‚Äù of the boar differs in appearance, as in
extent of surface, from those of all the recent animals that have
been mentioned, yet, upon comparing it with the large fossil
teeth found on the banks of the river Ohio in North America,
belonging to the animal incognitum, they are-s0 much alike,
both in their external appearance and internal structure, that it
is evident they are teeth of the same kind, only of very different
SIZES. This resemblance led me to examine the mode of dentition
of this unknown animal, as far as could be done from the
specimens preserved in this country, to see if any resemblance
could be traced between it and that of the wild boar. From the different specimens of these fossil teeth deposited in
the Britich Museum, the collection of the late Dr, WiLLI1am
HouNTER, and the HunTERIan Museum, together with one in
my own possession, presented to me by Sir Joszpn Banks, the
following facts have been ascertained. The first grinders are small, when compared with those which


of the wild Boar, and Animal incognitum, 325

are afterwards formed, being scarcely more than half their size :
they have three transverse projecting ridges, completely en-
crusted with enamel, as well as every other part of the masti-
cating surface. |

Two of these grinders, and probably more, are present on
each side of the jaw at the same time, As the animal increases
in'size, and the jaw extends itself, a larger kind of grinder is
formed in the posterior part of the jaw, exactly similar to what
happens in the elephant; and, as this large tooth, which has five
projecting transverse ridges .on the masticating surface, becomes
completely formed, it comes forward, and occupies the principal
seat-in'the jaw, and the others drop out. When the smaller grinders are examined, the greater num-
ber of them have their fangs all bent-in- one direction, in con-
Sequence of the- bodies of the teeth having been pushed for-
ward, bythe large posterior tooth coming into their place,
as was observed in the temporary grinders of the young Sus
Ethiopicus.
