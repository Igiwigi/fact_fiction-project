which tends to corroborate, in a great degree, Dr. ProuT's statement,—* that uncom-
bined agents of the alkaline or acid kind are ill-calculated to act as s0Jvents for cal-
culi; and that solvents are to be sought for among a class of harmless and unirrita-
ting compounds, the elements of which are s0 associated as to act at the same time
with respect to calculous ingredients, both as alkalies and acids*,”

8 DR. HOSKINS ON THE DECOMPOSITION OF CALCULI,

«At present,” continues Dr. ProvuT, *no such class of compounds of a decided
character are known, or appear likely to be discovered; yet, as no chemical fact can
be stated & priori, we know not what remains in store among the arcana of nature.”

The conviction I had acquired of the truth of these observations induced me to
abandon all attempts at positive or direct solution, but rather to try the effect of in-
direct means, namely those of decomposition and disintegration ; as preliminaries to
s0lution by some bland fluid, or to mechanical remoyal, by the injection of a con-
tinuous stream of liquid through a double current catheter.

It appeared, hitherto, to have been the object, to act on calculi by single elective
affinity only ; that is, to dissolve the base before it was disengaged from its associated
acid. This mode having failed to produce agents sufficiently active on the one hand,
and mild on the other; it seemed more in accordance with chemical principles, and
