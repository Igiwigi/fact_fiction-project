Lepidosiren and Protopterus lay a large number of heavy yolky eggs in a burrow in
the ground under a very shallow sheet of water. In this burrow the male remains on
guard for a considerable time. The eggs hatch and the young larve stop in the burrow
until in Protopterus the internal gills become functional, the lung is fully formed, and the
external gill begins to show reduction. In Lepidosiren the larve remain in the nest for
a long time, perhaps till after the establishment of a functional lung. metamorphosis
takes place, the external gills undergoing a very rapid reduction. ;

The function of the external gills thus appears to be to secure the necessary supply of
oxygen to the developing larva in the dangerous period before the internal gills and
lung become available. That the problem of aération of a fairly large egg is difficult
under the conditions in which Protopterus develops is vividly shown by the fact that
two of the associated teleosts, Gymnarchus and Heterotus, develop a functional external
gill by the great elongation of internal gill filaments.

Ceratodus does not make a nest but lays its eggs much as a newt does, scattered
through and attached to the plants in fairly deep, permanent water. They thus develop
under normal conditions in relatively well aérated water, and obtain a sufficient gaseous
exchange through the skin and yolk sac until the lung and internal gills become
functional.

Thus, it is natural to suppose that the external gills arose as a special accessory
respiratory apparatus to carry the larva over the early stages of development. They
must have arisen under the conditions which led to the production of a lung, and may
