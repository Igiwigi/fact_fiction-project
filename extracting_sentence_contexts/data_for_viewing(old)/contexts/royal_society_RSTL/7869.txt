its vapour absorbing the same rays indicated that the absorption was not molecular.
We were thus driven to conclude that it was atomic* ; and this conclusion was fortified
by the consideration already adverted to,â€”that were the absorption the act of the mole-
cule as a whole, no mechanical ground could be assigned for the falling asunder of its
atoms. Thus actinic action itself pointed out the seat of the absorption.

A wide, if not entire generality was anticipated for the proposition that the same rays
are absorbed by a liquid and its yapour. I have now no reason to retract this anticipa-
tion; but when it was expressed I believed that liquids in general would be found 80
destructive of the effectual rays as to render transmission through moderate depths of
them sufficient to rob a beam of all power to act upon their vapours. This idea, enter-
tained though not expressed, has not been verified, and the deportment of iodide of
allyl may be taken as representative of a class of facts which contradict it.

Glass cells were employed varying from one-eighth of an inch to an inch in width.
Filled with the transparent iodide, these cells were placed between the electric lamp and
the experimental tube charged with the iodide vapour. The rays after traversing an
inch of the liquid produced copious decomposition in the tube. A marked distinction
was thus proved to exist between the liquid iodide of allyl and the liquid nitrite of amy].

But the same distinetion extends to their vapours. The exceeding absorbent avidity
of the nitrite-of-amyl vapour, and the rapidity with which it deprives a powerful beam
of its effective constituents, have been already noticed. It is quite different with the
jodide of allyl. A tube 5 feet long was charged with the iodide vapour, and after it, in
the same line, was placed another tube 3 feet long charged with the same vapour. On
