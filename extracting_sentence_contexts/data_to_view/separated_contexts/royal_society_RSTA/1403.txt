Put « = exp (4xt) ; this equation becomes

a* — 623 —62 +5 = 0. The solution of this is c = 6-1376, giving ¢ = 1-732 and d= 0-144. This suggests
that the exact solution is ¢ = 1/3, and, in fact, if we put = 1/3 andd = 4 a simple

consideration shows us that w(0,—c) is zero. If a diagram is drawn for the case

t=/3,d = ey , that is a = 1/3 p, b= 6p, ¢ = 3\/3 p, where op is. some constant,

we see that the configuration is such that any two consecutive vortices on one row
subtend an angle of 120° at that vortex, on the other row, which is opposite the
centre of the interval between these vortices.
