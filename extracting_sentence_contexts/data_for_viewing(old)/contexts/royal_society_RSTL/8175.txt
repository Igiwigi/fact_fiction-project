T, 8uch that the anharmonic ratio {A B C D} is given, the locus of D is a conic section.

160. If we take any point P on one of the four nodal lines of Z, then through P can
be drawn two lines of Z, say L, L/ ; let these meet the other nodal lines of &; in the two
triads of points a, a', a", Þ, 0, b"; then, since the lines of & are divided equianharmonically
by its nodal lines, the two ranges are equal, Pa'a”, Pbh'b”, Hence the lines are con-
current, ab, &t', a't", the point of concurrence, being the yertex of the tetrahedron oppo-
site to the plane of the node on which is taken the point P.

161. If we denote the four nodal conics of Z by N, N', N”, N"”, and if J be the section
of the sphere U made by the face of the tetrahedron on which N lies, P the point where
a common tangent PP! of J and N touches N, then the lines of & which can be drawn
through P are coincident; in fact the section of Z made by the plane of N consists of the
conic N repeated twice, and of the four common tangents of J and N, the equations of
the common tangents being

(see SALMON'Ss © Geometry of Three Dimensions,” p. 161). Hence it follows from the
last article that the common tangent PP' meets each of the remaining nodal conics
N', N”, N”', and that the tangents to N', N”, N"', at the points where PP' meets them,
are complanar and concurrent, the point of concurrence being the opposite vertex of the
tetrahedron. Hence we easily infer the following theorem :—The three nodal conies
N', N”, N"" pass respectively through the three pairs of opposite intersections of the tetragram
