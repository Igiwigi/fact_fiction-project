But to those who fully recognise how greatly the outline and character of the leaves
of modern living ferns may vary within the single genus, this point would seem to be
over estimated, I see in it no sufficient reason for separating the Asterotheces from
Kaulfussia. In any case the correspondence between the sori seems to be a peculiarly
close one. It may be noted that Asterotheca is a relatively early form,{ a fact which
has its importance. Ptychocarpus (= Diplazites, Goer.) hevastichus appears to have sori of a similar
type to Asterotheca,§ but the sori are placed “in several rows on both sides of the
median nerve in each pinna,”|| a condition which has its interest for comparison with

Kaulfussia.
