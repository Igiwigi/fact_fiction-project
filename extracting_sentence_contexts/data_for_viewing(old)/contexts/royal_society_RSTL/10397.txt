Thus, by observing deflections right and left and taking the mean, we get a value
for the ratio of p/q which is independent of an error in the azimuth of the scale, much
greater than anything possible in the actual experiments.

If the magnet be not parallel to the mirror the angle turned through by the mirror
is 8t1ll that turned through by the magnet ; the fact that the magnet and mirror were
very nearly parallel afforded a ready means of setting the plane of the coils in the
magnetic meridian,

The time of a complete vibration was measured in the usnal way by noting the
times of. 8 or 10 transits of the resting point over the cross wire of the telescope,
then waiting for the period occupied by some 10 or 12 oscillations and again observing
the times of 8 or 10 transits. The value thus determined requires reducing to that
for an infinitely small arc.
