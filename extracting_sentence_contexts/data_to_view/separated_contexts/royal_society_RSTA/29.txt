The former can be explained by the fact that the VI solution is
obtained by minimizing a function of the posterior similarity matrix, and as each posterior sample
corresponds to an arbitrary partition of the data points into convex sets, each pair of data points
may have a relatively high probability of being clustered together. These examples highlight that the choice of estimator can greatly affect the number of clusters
and clustering solution. In fact, while most asymptotic theory focuses on the behaviour of the
marginal posterior on the number of clusters, quite a different behaviour is observed when
estimating the full clustering solution. As practitioners are interested in the full clustering
solution, this is an important aspect to consider. There are a number of interesting directions
to expand this study, including further investigating the performance of the different estimators
in the misspecified setting, as well as the case when the clusters are not well separated (Rajkowski
[157] finds that MAP tends to underestimate the number clusters in this setting), and sensitivity
to hyperparameters.
