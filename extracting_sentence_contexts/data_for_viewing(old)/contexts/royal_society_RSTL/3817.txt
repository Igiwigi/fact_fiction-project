8till less capable of being introduced into scientific language appears such a term as
invisible light. Whether the rays to which such terms have been applied $hall or
Shall not turn out, on inquiry, to be identical with my © parathermic” rays, can only
be decided by experiments to be instituted for that purpose ; but at all events I feel
strongly disposed to insist on the distinction between these rays and those of pure
heat, and in referring them to a peculiar region of the spectrum (though without
denying their more sparing distribution over every other part of it), I consider them
at all events as snfliciently identified by their characters, there eminently developed,
to become legitimate objects of scientific discussion.

241. The action of the calorific rays, as szck, demonstrated by the rapidity of eva-
poration of water or alcohol which takes place under their influence, is traced (in
addition to the facts brought forward in the notes on my first paper on this subject)

in the experiments described in Arts. 205, 208, in the latter of which a chemical
action, distinet from the calorific, seems also traceable. I may here also mention
that the rays which operate the change of colour in muriate of cobalt from rose colour
to green appear to be the calorific rays generally, and the effect to be one of sinple
evaporation ; Since under the action of the spectrum I find the green colour not re-
stricted to the © parathermic” region, but to extend far beyond the red, and to be, in
fact, commensurate with the calorific spectrum, 80 far as it conld be traced in an ex-
periment made under unfavourable circumstances.
