origin. This suggests that much of the value of any ESD comes from smoothing over a period of
10-15 min, where this value is near-uniform for all the designs plotted. This is because Brownian
variance is linear in time, and hence any losses proportional to the standard deviation are
proportional to the square root of the time interval.

Diminishing returns are seen in figure 4 to increase for both the capacity Qmax (continuous, left
to right on the horizontal axis), and the charge/discharge rate Lc = Lp (successive vertical jumps
in the vertical axis direction). Taking Qmax = 1, ARgsp = £11500 year}, Le =Lp = 250 kW as an
arbitrary datum point for comparison, more value is added by quadrupling the charge/discharge
rate to Lc = Lp = 1 MW than by quadrupling the capacity to Qmax = 4. The nonlinear response of
gross system value V to changes in Qmax and Lc = Lp permits quite complex economic trade-offs
between Qmax and Lc = Lp. The optimum ESD design maximizes the (positive) NPV of ESD net
earnings minus the capital cost of installing the ESD. The fact that there are sharply diminishing
