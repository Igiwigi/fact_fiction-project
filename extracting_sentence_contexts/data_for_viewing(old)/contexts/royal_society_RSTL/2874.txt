to the surface of which it firmly adhered. Around the reduced silicon, and suspended
in the fluid, was a dense gelatinous cloud of silicic acid. On quickly withdrawing
the slip of platinum, dipping it in water, and then pressing it between folds of bibu-
lous paper it was dried, and freed from any adhering solution. The silicon was
nearly black and granular, under a lens, exhibiting a tendeney to a crystalline form.
It was not deposited on the platinum in a confused or irregular manner, but in lon-
gitudinal striz, which appeared to follow the direction of certain lines of minute
eminences on the surface of the piece of platinum, produced apparently by scouring
it with fine sand and a piece of cork before being used for the construction of the
negative electrode.

13. The silicon thus procured becomes of a snowy whiteness when ignited in the
flame of a spirit lamp, and falls off the platinum in thin flakes, being in fact converted
into silicic acid. It is not very easy to oxidate the whole, in consequence of the flakes
of the acid forming an incrustation over the subjacent silicon, and protecting it from
the oxidating influence of the air even at a red heat. A portion of the silicon re-
moved from the platinum did not appear to dissolve in hydrochloric acid ; but when
the platinum itself with the firmly adhering silicon was immersed in the acid, slow
action ensued, bubbles of hydrogen being eyolyed from the exposed surface of pla-
tinum, the silicon very slowly disappearing ; the solution being probably occasioned
by the formation of a simple voltaic circle, the silicon and platinum being the metals,
and the acid the exciting fluid. When an aqueous solution of hydrofluosilicic acid is
s$ubstituted for the fluoride of silicon, the metalloid is reduced, but slower and in
