* The theory of Pavy, repeated in nearly every text-book, that the liver is “a sugar destroying, and
not a sugar forming organ,” rests on so unsubstantial a basis and has been so completely refuted by the
work of Srecey and other inyestigators that it need not be considered.

+ Payy’s position, of course, necessitates the conception that hepatic glycogen has a fate other than
sugar,

To draw such a conclusion from the former fact shows a want of appreciation of
the relationship of glycogen to the sugar, so clearly recognized by BERNARD. Itig
when a supply of glycogenie (7.c., sugar yielding) material exists in the liver thatit
is stored as glycogen, just as in a resting gland cell, when there is no call for mucin, —
or the special zymin, an accumulation of mucinogen or of zymogen occurs. If the
demand for sugar in the organism is urgent, the liver is deprived of the material for
the formation of this substance. To argue the non-relationship of sugar to glycogen |
for this reason is as absurd as to argue the non-relationship of mucin and the zymins
to the mucinogen and the zymogens, because, in the prolonged activity of the cells,
these latter bodies are not accumulated and stored. ‘

Against the experimental basis of the second objection must be set the observations”
of Boru and Horrmayn (‘Pfliiger’s Archiv,’ vol. 23) and of Grrarp (‘ Pfliiger's”
