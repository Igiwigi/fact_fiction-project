The Totten Glacier contains roughly
the same amount of water as the entire WAIS—equivalent to at least 3.5m of global sea-
level rise—so adding the melting of Totten to the melting of WAIS would double the amount
of sea-level rise globally to 7m. That sea-level rise would of course endure for millennia—
from a human perspective, forever. This despite the fact that the amount of atmospheric


CO» that launched the melting was ‘corrected’ later by negative emissions. Can we count on
nothing like this hypothetical scenario happening? That is the gamble taken by less ambitious
mitigation.
