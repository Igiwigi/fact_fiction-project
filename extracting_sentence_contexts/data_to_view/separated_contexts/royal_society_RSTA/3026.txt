Furthermore, their results showed that vertical mixing was more important in the productive
shelf regions, where we find greater imbalance between new and export production.

4. Conclusion

Taken together, our results add to a growing body of literature showing that new and net
community production are high in the WAP, but that they are not balanced by the sinking flux of
particles measured by sediment traps or 75U :?54Th disequilibrium [27,44,47]. Our specific result
of good agreement between "NO; uptake new production measurements and O> : Ar-based NCP
measurements (cruise averages always agreed to within a factor of 2), give us good confidence
that the new production-export imbalance results not from a methodological bias, but in fact
reflects the reality of an ecosystem in which other processes (vertical mixing, active transport
by vertically migrating zooplankton, removal by migratory whales and seabirds) are important
components of the biological pump. Quantifying these alternate mechanisms of export, along
with their spatio-temporal variability and differential responses to secular warming in the WAP,
should be considered a priority for further research. Data accessibility.
