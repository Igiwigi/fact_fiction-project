If a

a major subset of the cells had been discharged indirectly, s

then a right-skewed distribution with scattered long-latency a

values would be expected. The short and symmetric firing © 2

latencies of the light-responsive neurons suggest instead that Ss

the discharging cells were activated directly. This interpret- S

ation is further supported by the fact that spike latencies =

were substantially longer (between 16 and 30 ms) when MEC = S

2mm cells were activated by photostimulation of presynaptic ©

fibres, in the alveus of the hippocampus, and it is consistent >

(b) with the finding that backfiring of MEC neurons from the | =

angular bundle or perforant path led to fast discharge, at yy

latencies just slightly longer than those obtained with light 2

pulses in the MEC itself [27]. Synaptically induced activity &

was occasionally seen also after stimulation in the MEC, a

expressed either as secondary spikes at longer latencies w

(fig. S9C and S14 in [27]) or as longer firing latencies for the =

primary spike (bottom rows in each panel of figure 3 of this |S

paper, as well as in fig. 6D of [27]).
