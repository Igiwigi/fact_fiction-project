ELLIOT SMITH ON A COMPARATIVE

The Occipital Region. The region of the occipital poles is so clearly modelled that its features can be identified
without any uncertainty. The interpretation is further facilitated by the fact that
this part of the brain conforms to a pattern which is well known in the Orang-utan,
fig. 1, Plate 53. The sulcus lunatus (18) coincides with the lambdoidal suture, fig. 2,
and its prominent posterior lip clearly defines the limit of the great occipital operculum
which marks the boundary of the area striata. The occipital or lunate operculum, fig. 3, Plate 53, forms a triangular elevation on
the posterior aspect of the cast.
