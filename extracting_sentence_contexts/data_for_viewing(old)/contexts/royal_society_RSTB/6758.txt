apparent that the structure of the coast is nearly constant for a distance of about 10
miles north of the gorge. The sections shown in figs. 12 and 13 are typical of this shore,
the former showing the folding which has affected the yellow tuffs underlying the
lavas. Unfortunately, it was impossible in that case to make out the relationship of the
overlying lava to the faulting. These yellow tuffs become a very familiar sight, for they
appear from beneath the basalts at innumerable points north of Sirima Gorge and also
on Hoéhnel Island. Sometimes they are fossiliferous, sometimes quite barren, ap-
parently according to whether they were subaqueously or subaerially deposited. In
general appearance and from the fossils that they contain, they are similar to the great
pile of yellow tuffs that form the base of Pullo, itself a nest of late Pleistocene ash cones
contemporary with those of Sirima, Hohnel Island, and Nabuyatom. Indeed, it is
likely that the early explosive phase of Pullo was responsible for scattering these tuffs
over the surrounding country. The fact that they have been faulted and folded suggests
that they were formed before the movements at the close of the Middle Pleistocene,
though those occurring on Héhnel Island appear to be post-faulting.

About 10 miles north of Sirima Gorge the section shown in fig. 13 was seen. There

the normal lake shore section has been altered by the intrusion of a much later basalt
through yellow tuffs and the debris derived from lavas that overlie them to the east.
