In other respects
their carbon balance sheets are very similar. Another instance is given in Part Il
for different strains of A. nidulans Epa. We have at present no explanation to offer for
what is undoubtedly a very definite biochemical fact, since it must be remembered that
in all of these experiments identical cultural conditions were followed. On the other
hand there are several instances in which different strains of the same species of
Penicillium, obtained from different parts of the world, give carbon balance sheets
which are almost indistinguishable from one another. Notable examples of
these are to be found in Table II for five different strains of P. (Citromyces)
glabrum Wexner, and in Table XID for three different strains of Scopulariopsis
brevicaulis (Sacc.) BAINTER.
