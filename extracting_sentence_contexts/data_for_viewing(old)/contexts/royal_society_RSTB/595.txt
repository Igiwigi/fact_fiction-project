On comparing this description of the cingulum with the account given by various
authors on human anatomy, it would seem that, although communications have been
traced along the annectant gyri from the cingulum to other convolutions, they are
described by Fovitte and Huauentin (p. 142) as fibre arciforme and resemble the -
fibree proprize of other parts. In the Marmoset, on the other hand, the fibres of the
cingulum have a definite direction ; they are quite distinct from the superficial fibree
propriz, and with the exception of the calcarine fibres, they have an arrangement
special to themselves; they end deeply in the centrum ovale, and are not part of the
superficial connecting fibres of the cortex.

The peculiar arrangement of the cingulum in the gyrus fornicatus is of especial
interest, when considered with the fact found out by Professors Horstey and
ScHArer,* that whereas the marginal convolution was excitable, no movement was
produced when the gyrus fornicatus was stimulated electrically, and moreover that
loss of sensation on the opposite part of the body was produced in Monkeys when
parts of this convolution were removed, thus showing that it was associated with the
function of sensation. It is here suggested that in the Marmoset the cingulum may
form internuncial fibres between the gyrus fornicatus—the sensory part of the
cortex —and the part of the centrum ovale in connection with the so-called motor
cortex. q

Calearine Fibres.—In describing the cingulum frequent allusion has been made to
a system of fibres which I have called calcarine, from the fact that they are found in
that part of the cortex which is involuted to form the calcarine fissure.
