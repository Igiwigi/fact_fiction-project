Each bundle has a triangular section,
© the apex being centripetal, and is from *012 to *008 from base to apex. The onter-
S most bark, c, appears to have been a thin epidermal layer, some *003 to *002 in thickness.
:= The peripheral border of this zone is sharply defined and entire, being wholly devoid
2 of the crenulated contour 80 long supposed to have characterised the exteriors of sec-
F tions of the Calamites. Every definite fact hitherto discovered demonstrates that
S those outer surfaces possessed neither longitudinal flutings nor nodal constrictions.
8 Whether the fibrous bundles just described are the beginnings of the prosenchymatous
& zone shown in figs. 14 and 15 of my ninth memoir, or whether they are peculiar to
s gome gpecial form of Calamite, cannot now be determined. The specimen described
Z has a diameter of '25.

£ Lepidodendroid plants. Z In 8everal of my memoirs T have called attention to the gradual growth that took
<= place in the diameter of the Lepidodendoid medulla owing to the multiplication of
Z the medullary cells, and also to a contemporaneous increase that took place in the size
A of the surrounding non-exogenous vascular cylinder or © 6tui medullaire” of BroNG-
NIART, as well as in the number of its component vessels.
