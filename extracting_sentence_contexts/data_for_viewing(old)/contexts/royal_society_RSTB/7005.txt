Cc. W. WARDLAW ON THE SHOOT APEX OF DRYOPTERIS 345

The first step was to ascertain the practicability of the operation. The manipulative
difficulty lies in the fact that the treatment has to be applied to a minute region, the
meristem, the tissue of which is soft, delicate and readily injured. Thereafter it remained
to be seen whether a meristem so treated would prove capable of further growth. .

The successful outcome of such experiments seemed likely to throw light on: (i) morpho-
genetic processes at the shoot apex and the development of the leafy-shoot type of organiza-
tion; (ii) the problem of translocation of nutrients to the shoot apex, i.e. whether this takes
place by way of the undifferentiated vascular tissue or by upward diffusion over the whole
cross-sectional area of the shoot; (iii) factors influencing the differentiation of the vascular
system, i.e. whether the effective stimuli proceed basipetally from the apex or acropetally
from the older preformed parts; and (iv) the physiological dominance normally exercised
by the shoot apex over lateral buds or bud primordia.
