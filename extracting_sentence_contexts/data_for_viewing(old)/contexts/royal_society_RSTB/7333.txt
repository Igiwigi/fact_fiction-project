Experiment shows that it is impossible to select three primaries so that no negative values
are required in any part of the spectrum. Abney (1895) took considerable pains to reduce
these negative values as far as possible, the wave-lengths he selected being 6500, 5300 and
4600A. From the matches which were made by ten observers with normal colour vision,
using these selected rays, the average negative values for the four spectral regions were
about 2 % in the red (7500A), and in the yellow-green (5500A); about 14 % in the blue-
green (5000A); and about 4 % in the violet (4000A). The negative values are not large,
except in the case of the blue-green, but all of them are too large to be accounted for as
being due to experimental error.

Three explanations of these negative values have been offered: (a) that the red, green
and blue sensations are purer, that is, more saturated than any spectral colour; (4) that the
negative values are due to central inhibition; (c) that vision is, in fact, polychromatic and
that in consequence three primary colours when mixed do not match all the spectral
colours (Granit 1945).

With regard to the first explanation, it is thought that the retinal receptors, which are
responsible for arousing the three primary sensations, are stimulated to some extent by
rays from all parts of the spectrum. Thus, the green receptors not only react to rays near
the middle of the spectrum, but also slightly to red rays and blue-violet rays as well. In
consequence, a mixture of red rays and green rays, which causes a sensation of yellow light,
also causes a sensation of blue at the same time. Since the latter is complementary to
yellow, the result is that the yellow appears to be diluted with white. Yellow rays, on the
other hand, which stimulate the red and the green receptors, affect the blue receptors
hardly at all, so that these rays appear to possess a greater degree of purity than a mixture
