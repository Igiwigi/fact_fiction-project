Experience with integrated water management in recent decades has sometimes been very time-
intensive but with limited output. The optimal degree of cross-domain collaboration needs to be
assessed. The extent of complexity and relevance of water and sanitation to diverse domains is
illustrated by the fact that the number of UN entities engaged in water issues now exceeds 30.

5. Conclusion

The broad water security definition, combined with the human right to water and sanitation,
has the potential to provide a sound policy base for sustainable improvement of the human
condition ina fragile environment. Much detailed exploration of the implications of this approach
is required, and its implications for the way targets are set and monitored.
