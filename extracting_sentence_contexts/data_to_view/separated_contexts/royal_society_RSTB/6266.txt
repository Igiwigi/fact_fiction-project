A fuller investigation of this will be made later. The temperature in relation to moon phase shows (as has already been mentioned)
warmer conditions at full moon in 1933 ; at no moon in 1934 ; and at intermediate
moon in 1935. On the three years combined there is still a bias of about 0-3° F. in favour of the
full moon, so that the results obtained are not due to any accidental temperature
effect, and, in fact, if temperature had been normally distributed the effect of the
moon might be expected to be slightly greater than that shown. ACTIVITY OF NOCTUR

“* intermediate
“no moon—inter-
mediate cloud ”’, so that the inconsistence of the catch figures for the former division
is at least partly explained. To sum up—the ratio of catches in the Noctuidae in the three years combined
is shown to be about 2-7 : 1 when no moon is compared to full moon (in spite of a
small temperature effect in favour of full moon) ; and 1-75 : 1 when cloudy nights
are compared with clear nights, this being associated with a temperature difference
of about 4° F. in favour of the cloudy nights (owing to reduction of radiation by the
clouds), and possibly explicable on this basis alone.
