control for exposure time: recorded material could be replayed
multiple times while the live session was only live once.
Studies that controlled for content and exposure time across
conditions found a significant improvement in learning of
medical students during social interactive lectures compared
to recorded tutorials [75,76].

The studies reviewed above did not directly control the
social factor during learning. In a study from our group [27],
we designed two repeated-measure yoked-control experiments
and tested learning of over 50 adults during online sessions in
different conditions designed to specifically test different social
factors. People learned some facts about uncommon items
(musical instruments, ancient objects, exotic food and animals)
in interaction with a teacher (experimenter) and some other
facts from videos of another participant attending to the pre-
vious experimental session. Results robustly showed that
performance was better for items learned in live-interaction
with the teacher, and such advantages remained a week later.
In this study, all conditions were social: however, while in the
recorded-video condition, the student took part in observational
social learning (learning by watching a video of another tea-
cher-student interaction), during live sessions the student
directly engaged with the teacher (interactive social learning).
