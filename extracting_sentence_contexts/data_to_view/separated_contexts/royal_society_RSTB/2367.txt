vascular supply. The micropyle is tubular to the one, slit-shaped in the other. In
fact, the two things are in every respect different, the true Cardiocarpon being a
typical Gymnospermous seed, while the fructification of Lepidocarpon is, as we have
seen, the integumented megasporangium of a Lycopod. Carruruers’ C. anomalum,
like Bron@nrArt’s specimens, doubtless belonged to the Cordaitese. W1.t1Amson’s
Cardiocarpon anomalum, our Lepidocarpon, belongs to the Lycopodiaces, and has no
affinity with BRon@NrArt’s genus,

At present, Lepidocarpon stands isolated.
