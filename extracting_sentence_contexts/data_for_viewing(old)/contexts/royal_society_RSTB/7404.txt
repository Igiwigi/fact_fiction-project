female series of any of the modern apes. The height of its lingual face does not deviate
significantly from the corresponding measurement of the male orang-outang and female
gorilla, but is less than that of the male and female chimpanzee, the male gorilla, and
the female orang-outang. The maximum transverse dimension of the labial face is signifi-
cantly less than that of the male and female chimpanzee and the male gorilla. It is smaller,
but not significantly so, at a level of P<0-02, than in the male orang-outang, but does not
differ from the female orang-outang. The labio-lingual breadth is less than in the male or
female chimpanzee, the female orang-outang, and the male gorilla, but only its deviations
from the male gorilla and male orang-outang are significant at a level of P<0-02.

Senyurek (1941) claims that the upper lateral incisor of Plesianthropus is smaller than that
of the living apes, and that in the extent of its reduction, it parallels later stages of human
evolution. In view of the facts revealed by the present study, his first statement seems to
have no foundation. The upper lateral incisor of Plesianthropus is not significantly smaller
than that of the modern female gorilla, and very little, if at all, smaller than the female
orang-outang.

Upper canine. Both upper canines of Plesianthropus correspond in size and shape with the
female chimpanzee. The second specimen also agrees with the male chimpanzee and
female orang-outang. The index of neither specimen deviates from the male or female
series of any extant species of great ape.

The first specimen is narrower than in the male chimpanzee and both shorter and
narrower than in the female orang-outang. None of these differences is, however, significant
at a level of P<0-02. This specimen is significantly shorter and narrower than in both
