We drew attention for the first time to this differentiation of cortical representa-
tion of the eyelids in our second paper just referred to, where we described the
opening of one eye before the other. Since writing that paper, we have been engaged
in investigating the cortical representation of closure of the eyes, and we have found
that there is a nearly horizontal zonular strip of the cortex just below and slightly
overlapping the lower border of the upper limb area of representation, in which the
single movement of closure of the opposite eyelids is represented.

In some cases this is imperfect, i.e, the eyelids of the side stimulated closed
as well as those of the opposite side. It is clear, therefore, that this movement is
only imperfectly bilateral, a fact of the greatest importance, as is evidenced by the
fact that we have been able with this observation to correctly diagnose that the

homologous portion of the cortex in man was the seat of an irritative lesion.

Hence we were not surprised to find that in the internal capsule there were fibres,
excitation of which produced closure of the opposite eyelids only.
