It will also be important to establish the underlying mechan-
ism of the early cognitive and neural changes produced by
antidepressant treatment. Cellular and molecular accounts of
antidepressant action have tended to focus on relatively slow-
acting effects; however, it is clear from the neurocognitive
model that more immediate effects on brain chemistry or struc-
ture must also be important. There is some evidence that
short-term antidepressant treatment may increase expression
of neurotrophins and produce synaptic remodelling in the hip-
pocampus [108,109], suggesting one possible molecular locus
for early behavioural and neuroimaging changes. However, it
remains to be seen whether these or any other early molecular
effects do in fact underlie changes in emotional processing.

Finally, another challenge is whether we can harness early
change in emotional processing as a measure of response that is
useful for clinical decision-making. A marker of response after
a single dose or after 7 daysâ€™ treatment would be faster than
standard clinical practice and may speed up finding the right
treatment for a particular patient. Whether making this infor-
mation available to prescribers improves speed to remission
will need further empirical testing.
