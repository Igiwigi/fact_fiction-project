In conclusion I have much pleasure in acknowledging the great care with which
my assistant, Mr. A. G. G. Leonarp, A.R.C.Se.1., has photographed and accurately
measured all of the vapour spectra of benzene and its homologues under different
conditions, and the precise account he has rendered of the numerous analyses of the

vapours, which were performed in different ways.
