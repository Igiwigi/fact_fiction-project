it “‘even the seeds, notwithstanding that at first sight they have not the

«that the stamens also are in their nature simply leaves. In one word,

ed with the parts of the flower, did not distinguish sporangia as a separate
y, but as modifications of leaves or parts of leaves.
3 same was essentially Goxrrir’s view, arrived at by a distinct course of
sing. Gorrurt (1790) at the outset drew attention to the fact that certain
or parts of plants sometimes “change and pass into the form of adjacent parts
wholly or in greater or less degree.” Of this change or “ metamorphosis ” he
nishes three kinds, regular, irregular, and occasional; the third, since it
