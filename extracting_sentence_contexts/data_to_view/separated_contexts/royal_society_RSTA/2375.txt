1; and, secondly, because it
shows that changes in the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere are propagated
upwards in the same way as changes in temperature. Bends in the humidity curve
occur at the same heights as bends in the temperature curve. ‘This is in fact to be
expected, for it is evident that the reasoning which was used to deduce the lang

kite ascents which were made from the “ Scotia,’ and most of them did have bends in
them.
