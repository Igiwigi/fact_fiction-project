176 PROFESSOR KARL PEARSON, MATHEMATICAL

The formule for stature reconstruction, whether obtained with a consciousness of the
theory of regression, as in the present paper, or indirectly by taking the means of
small groups, as by M. Manouvrtier, are based upon averages, and involve the
standard-deviations, the variabilities of distribution of each organ. Hence, the fact
that individual variations may be greater than ethnic variations does not touch the
real point at issue, for the formulee depend on the proportions of macroskely and
microskely in each race, and these undoubtedly change. The individual variation
being greater than the ethnic, is not a valid argument for applying a formula based
on the observation of one local race straight away to a second. :

The validity of applying the formula for one local race to a second depends, I
think, upon very different considerations. In the first place, the validity is not
general. If we endeavoured to reconstruct the radius, for example, of Aino or
Naqada races from the femur or tibia by a regression formula obtained from measure-
ments on the French, the results would, we might @ priori expect, not be so
satisfactory as for stature.*
