Study of the voltaic arc under various circumstances, while employing different sub-
stances as electrodes, both in the air and in a vacuum ; I shall then proceed to exa-
mine the action of a powerful electro-magnet on this voltaic arc, and I shall conclude
by describing some remarkable experiments also illustrating the influence of magne-
tism on conducting bodies, of whatever nature, traversed by interrupted currents.

I 1. Some Phenomena concerning the Yoltaic Arc.

Davy was the first who produced the phenomenon of the voltaic arc with two
points of charcoal. More recently, Messrs. Grovs* and DantsLL4 employed with
success the points of different metals, and arrived at interesting results : I also
published some experiments I made on the voltaic arc} in 1841. Subsequently
MM. Frzeav and Fovcavrr observed some remarkable facts of the same kind on the
occasion of an investigation into the intensity of the light emitted by charcoal in the
experiment of Dayyh. The researches made up to the present time, have already led
to many results, of which I shall consider only the most important.

1. That the voltaic arc may be produced, a pile of greater tension is required than
that which is necessary for the ordinary calorific and electro-chemical phenomena.
The necessity of this condition proves the great resistance presented to the passage
of the electric current by the minutely divided matter, whatever it may be, which
connects the two poles.

2. The luminous arc cannot exist, unless contact be previously made between the
electrodes, and unless these, or at least one of them, be terminated at the point of
