Art. 24. The relation
nw —(2"-1l—o)=n—1

will be established, and this leads to the conclusion that the redundant form, when

possible, is always of a (n — 1)

infinite character.

Art, 25. The fact, subject to the above-mentioned conditions, that there is an
infinite flexibility in the redundant forms is of great importance in the Theory of
Numbers, because the potentiality of arithmetical interpretation would appear to

have no finite limit,

Art. 26. Observe that
on
denotes the number of identical relations or syzygies connecting the coaxial minors of
a general determinant of order n.

Art. 27. The discussion of the theory of the first few orders forms a convenient
method of approaching the general theory.
