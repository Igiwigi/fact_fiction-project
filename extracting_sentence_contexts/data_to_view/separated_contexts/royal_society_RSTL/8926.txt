In this case both
hypotheses are equally tenable, and we haye no means of giving a preference to either. But there is another case : both hypotheses may include all the facts, and s0 far either
may 8erve our purpose ; but one of the two may also do more than we want, covering
more ground than is required, and indicating improbable results. In this case that
hypothesis is to be preferred the consequences of which most exactly coincide with the
facts, namely, the more restricted hypothesis. As8uming, then, that we are in possession of the symbols of the units of ponder-
able matter constructed, with logical precision, upon these two several hypotheses,
let us consider the consequences to be deduced from the expressions thus assigned to
them. To simplify the problem, let us take the case of the compounds of hydrogen, chlorine,
oxygen, carbon.
