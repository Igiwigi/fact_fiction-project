This was an error which for some
time kept me off the right track. The question of the permanence of the periodicities is one of vital importance, and I
s have endeavoured throughout to keep my mind free from all preconceived notions. Every one thus looking with unprejudiced eyes at the main facts must feel himself
‘2 drawn in opposite directions. On the one hand there is the evidence of the periodo-
gram which indicates almost decisively a new departure at the beginning of the
nineteenth century ; on the other hand we have the remarkable fact that WoLrer,
making use of all the data since 1610, deduced 11°124 years as the most probable
‘g period—a result identical with mine. Similarly Newcoms,* after a most careful
examination of the same records, arrives at a period of 11°13 years.
