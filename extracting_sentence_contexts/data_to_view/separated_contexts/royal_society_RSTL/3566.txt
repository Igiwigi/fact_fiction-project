It is further to
be remarked, in connection with these plants, that Salisburia fruit not only presents
no trace of coniferous tissues, but abounds in scalariform annular and subspiral
vessels, which are supposed to be very rare in the order to which it belongs.

* These analyses are added in the hope that they may aid others in the investigation of this interesting 8ub-
ject, should any one be s0 fortunate as to detect any contents within the cavity of Trigonocarpon. We have also
at fig. 12 figured some loose eclerogen cells that are found occasionally on the inner wall of the crustaceous
integument, and at figs. 13 and 14 ome modifications of the cellular tissue in the inner coat. CONTAINED IN NODULES OF LIMESTONE. 155

The abundance of these Trigonocarpons in the nodules, and the fact of their
- lying at all angles and in all positions, suggests the probability of their having fallen
from a height into a soft or spongy mass of decaying vegetable matter; and it may
be noticed, that the very similar fruits of Podocarpus ferruginea, a New Zealand
drupe-bearing Conifer, are in like manner $hed in profusion from the lofty trees
that produce them, and become imbedded in the swamps out of which the trees
grow ; and that the latter are often coyered with Ferns and Lycopodia in great pro-
fusion, the decay of all which produces a spongy bog, in consistence not unlike that
of the mass in which the Trigonocarpons are imbedded. Such comparisons cannot,
however, be carried far; for whereas these New Zealand bogs, and the clay upon
which they almost invariably rest, are everywhere traversed by woody roots of coni-
ferous trees, we find in the substance of the limestone nodules and in the underclay
of the coal no trace of these, but in the latter Sigillaria roots abundantly (viz. Stig-
maria ficoides).
