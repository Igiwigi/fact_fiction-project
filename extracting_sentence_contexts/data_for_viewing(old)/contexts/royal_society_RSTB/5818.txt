branching was a sort of modified repeated dichotomy, the basal segments clasping the
rachis. Each pinna is deeply cleft down the middle, this first dichotomy being already
initiated in the vascular supply long before it emerges from the petiolar cortex. The
further branching of the two halves is not so regular, the segments towards the outer
side tending to become thinner and also more and more confluent, sometimes forming
continuous expanses of lamina, as Srenzet has already pointed out. It would be
difficult to reconstruct the exact form of a pinna without examining a close series of
sections, but the available facts seem to indicate that the basal segments of the two

* No case has yet been observed where a definite peripheral loop is formed such as we now know in
several species of this genus, namely, in 2. Tubicaulis (BerTRAND, 1909, p. 144), E. Bertrandi, Scorr

The pedate type of branching is strongly suggested by the basal (clasping) segments
