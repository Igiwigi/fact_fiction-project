we assume the region to be s0mewhat in adyance of it, the latter would be in that place
where it could exert its maximum eastening effect; and therefore after that, as it
recedes westwards, would let the needle return from east to west, as it does, following
it. The needle continues to go west, passing its mean place for the month about 7b;
in the meantime, before that, at a little after 6 o'clock, the sun has left, the western
segment by passing the magnetic equator; it has not yet set to Greenwich, and if it
have any action, it will, because of the segment it is now in (2979.), still be to carry
the needle end westward. The end in fact continues to go westward, slowly only, after
10 o'clock, gaining a little from 10* to 15h; and then, as the sun comes up, passing
more rapidly west, as it ought to do, until 19%, and finally making the great swing to
the east as before. The whole progression here is very simple, and apparently a
natural result of the ass1med cause. Effects of cooling no doubt come in; but the
cold region has diminished in intensity and extent (3006.), has retreated northward,
and its action appears in combining with the former to produce only variations in the
velocity of the change.

3023. Then for the winter, let us consider January; and, as the eastening is a
maximum in all the months at 1 o'clock, after the sun's passage across the meridian,
let us begin the cycle there. At 1" the upper end of the needle is at extreme east,
and the amount of the variation not half what it was in summer, the sun being now
