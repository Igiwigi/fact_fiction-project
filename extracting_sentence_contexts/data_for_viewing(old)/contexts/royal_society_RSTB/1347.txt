abundant, though fewer than in specimens collected in summer.
How are these bodies to be regarded ?
qt appears probable that they are either of nuclear nature, or that they are food
@uterial in some stage of metabolism.
In favour of their nuclear nature is the fact that with the reagents which I have
iged they have the same staining reactions as the nuclear elements.
<.0n the other hand against their nuclear nature many considerations may be urged.
2 They are generally (at least in four cases out of five) absent altogether from speci-
fens in which the large nuclear elements are well stained, and their presence or
absence appears to be entirely independent of any change which may be seen in these
waiclei. They may occur in both microspheric and megalospheric forms, whose large
Biclear elements are so strongly contrasted, and in both young and old specimens.
2In favour of the view that they are food stuff are the facts that they are always
B abundant in the terminal chambers, through which the greater part of the food
‘@ken in must pass before it is elaborated into protoplasm, and that, as above stated,
Bey are to a large extent absent from specimens kept under conditions unfavourable

£ In the Infusorian Balantidium entozoon (Eur.), which inhabits the rectum of the
0g, bodies which appear to be of a similar nature are often present (fig. 4, « and b).
preparations (made in March) killed with osmie vapour, and stained with picro-
@rmine, the macro-nucleus is deeply stained, and what appears to be the micro-
Sucleus may generally be detected lying in a depression in it. In some specimens no
®her stained bodies are present, but in most cases numbers of round bodies with a
p red stain are thickly scattered through the protoplasm. They vary in size
m 1 to 5 or more in diameter, and while many are uniformly stained, in others
