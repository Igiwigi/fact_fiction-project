30° C. for each addition of CH,. The tertiary nitrites boil at lower temperatures th
the secondary nitrites and these in their turn at lower temperatures than the cor
sponding primary compounds. With the exception of methyl nitrite, which is a
all the nitrites used are liquids at common temperatures. It is conceivable that +}
more volatile nitrites might act more rapidly than those which are less volatile, wh
the effect produced by the volatile nitrites might be expected to be more transito
than that of the less volatile, and therefore less diffusible compounds.
All the nitrites examined belong to a homologous series the composition of who
members is representable by the general formula CyHyn,,NO, from which it follo
that as the series is ascended with increase of molecular weight, the amount «
nitroxyl contained in each molecule decreases. This fact has an important bearin
on the elucidation of the chemical cause of the physiological action of these bodi
For if their physiological activity is conditioned by the presence of the nitrox)
group then this activity should be most powerfully exerted by those compound
which are richest in this constituent, viz., those of low molecular weight, which sta
at the commencement of the series; whereas those nitrites which contain propot
tionately less nitroxyl, viz., those of high molecular weight, which stand last in
series, should be the weakest in their physiological action. That the presence of tl
nitroxyl group is the principal cause of the characteristic physiological effects of
these compounds there can be no doubt, since the inorganic nitrites (sodium ané
potassium nitrites) have been observed to give rise to many of the phenome
described in the former part of this paper as arising from the administration o
organic nitrites. This being so the question to be elucidated is to what extent, and
