extra trouble.

But .the greatest advantage of this method of reduction. is that it avoids the

accumulation of superfluous and meaningless figures, and thereby escapes that fictitious â€”
accuracy which is so seductive and treacherous in all physical investigations.

Corrections to be applied to the Air Thermometer.

Air does not follow exactly the equation of elasticity of a perfect gas pv/@ = mk.
| Since, however, it follows this law very approximately, its true equation of elasticity
may be written
