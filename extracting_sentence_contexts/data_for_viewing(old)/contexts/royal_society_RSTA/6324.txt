quickly dropping to almost zero between April and October/November (figure 4b). We therefore
limit our analysis to the months from October to March.

We find little difference in the average sea-ice drift in the selected area between the different
simulations (not shown). A greater difference is visible when looking at the 20th percentile of drift
speed, which is of the same order of magnitude as the average drift speed. This is consistent with
[23], ie. the impact was mostly an increase in mobility of fragmented ice when the drift is slow.
The greatest increase in the drift speed for this percentile is found for LFXST, with drift velocities
12% higher than in REF, likely because a lower ice strength increases the amount of ice break-up.
However, the increase in ice drift does not exceed 6% in DMG, where the wave attenuation and
ice break-up are the same as in REF. Overall, the impact is therefore not significant on the sea-ice
evolution in the model. This does not contradict [23]: waves can affect sea-ice mobility, but their
impact remains limited in time and space. The fact that we still find an increase in low drift speed
means that the updated neXtSIM rheology [33] used here compared to [23], with more resistance
to convergence, does not prevent waves from affecting sea-ice deformation.

4. Discussion and conclusion

We have compared the wMIZ extent in a coupled wave-sea-ice model with observations from IS-
2, showing satisfying results for our reference simulation. We have suggested two quantitative
metrics, So, and S19, for assessing whether the modelled wMIZ extent is underestimated or
overestimated. These metrics, Sj9 in particular, have to be considered in combination with a
qualitative assessment of the wMIZ. Using our methodology, values of S19 above 0.66, such
as for REF in winter, mean that the model does not overestimate the extent. Our method of
comparing a wave-ice model with WAF observations provides a simple but robust way to
