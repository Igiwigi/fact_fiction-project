rere observed and the observations repeated on more than thirty occasions with
Sarying rates of rise. Nearly half of these observations were taken with the alloy
Bire, whose resistance did not increase as the temperature rose, the remainder with
2 platinum wire. During this series of observations the weights of water were
ifferent, the supply of heat was trebled, the exterior temperature was shifted from
Bhe bottom to the top of our range, the pressure changed from 1 to 760 millims.,

, in fact, all the conditions were altered. The times of rising 10 millims. under

‘gil these different circumstances were thus determined at 42 points in our range, and

“ghe results plotted; the mean path in each case was, of course, different, but the

Seviations from it were regular in their occurrence and similar in their nature.
