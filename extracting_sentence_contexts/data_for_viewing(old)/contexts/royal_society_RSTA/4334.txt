“For systems with complex phase-space topology, equation (2.5) can be violated, see example in §2b, where the phase-
space regions corresponding to clockwise and anticlockwise motion become disconnected for supercritical energy values.
Such topologically peculiar systems do not thermalize in the traditional sense. However, for the most commonly considered
standard classical Hamiltonian systems, equation (2.5) is strictly satisfied.


In this context, it is worthwhile to note that any subsequent attempt to decouple the two ls |
systems results in non-microcanonical distributions for the separated systems, since the exact
individual energies are not known any more due to the permanent energy exchange during _
the equilibration phase (i.e. thermal coupling is irreversible). This means that, without further :
manipulation or measurements (or the introduction of a Maxwell demon), the total entropy
remains $142(E1 + Ez) after separation, a fact that has been missed by authors [23], who recently
criticised the Gibbs entropy. Unsurprisingly, this basic error led to paradoxical conclusions [23],
such as an apparent violation of mathematically exact inequalities.

For completeness, we mention that previous studies rarely focused on the third law,
mainly because it is well known that many classical systems (including the ideal gas) do
not obey the third law. Typically, verification of the third law requires a consistent quantum- 1g
mechanical treatment.° Evidently, the Gibbs entropy satisfies Sc(Eo) = kg Ingo with go denoting :
the degeneracy of the ground-state energy Eo and hence fulflls the most basic version of the =
third law. :F
