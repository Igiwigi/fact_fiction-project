The formula log F (z) = wz! — log (272*) is thus asymptotic exactly as the Maclaurin

m—l
series for m!and & x*, from which it is derived, are asymptotic. That is, for large
n=1

values of |z|, the expression 2~" {log F (z) — wz! + log 272*} for all values of n tends

to zero as |z| tends to infinity. There is, in fact, Porncars’s arithmetic asymptotic

dependence. The preceding example will serve to show the nature of the asymptotic expansions
which we can now proceed to obtain.

§ 52. We consider first the function P, (z) = Tl [1 oF zi. where p > 1.

n=1
We have

log P, (z) = (m — 1) logz — p= logn
