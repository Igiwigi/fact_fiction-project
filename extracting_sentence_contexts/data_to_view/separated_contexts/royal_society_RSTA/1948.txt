It is distinct from the errors


associated with discretization of the traction and numerical quadrature which we will consider
shortly. Regularization enables a particularly convenient discretization of the single layer boundary
integral equation; this simplicity however comes at a cost. The Nystrém method (3.2) corresponds
to using identical discretizations for the traction f<(y) and Sjx(x,y) when considered as functions
of position y € B (the latter for fixed x), despite the fact that the stokeslet kernel varies much
more rapidly than the traction, as shown in figure 1, the variability becoming more rapid as ¢ is
reduced (figure 2). The number of degrees of freedom of the system 3N and hence the 3N x 3N
matrix size is tied to the discretization for the traction, and so reducing the regularization error
via reducing ¢ entails rapid growth in memory and computational requirements associated with
system assembly and solution. Cortez et al. [24] initially suggested a quadrature error O(i?/e3)
where hi is the discretization length; more recently [42] this estimate has been improved to
O(h? /e) + O(Pe~V/Ph-?) for any integer P > 3.
