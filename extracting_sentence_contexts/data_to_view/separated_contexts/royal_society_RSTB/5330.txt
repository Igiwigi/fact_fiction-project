The present
investigation has fully substantiated such a conclusion, nuclear divisions being only
very rarely found. We were unable to correlate any particular conditions, such as
temperature, humidity, time of day or night when the material was fixed, with any
special tendency towards nuclear division. Recently Gurwirscs (22) has suggested
that “ mitogenetic rays” induce mitosis; the theory which he puts forward might
easily explain the fact that all the nuclei in a plasmodium divide together, but such
an idea is not supported by two associated but distinct plasmodia being found, one with
resting nuclei, while in the other the nuclei are dividing. (b) Akaryote Stage.—When the supply of food material fails, or when the plasmodium
completely fills the host cell, growth ceases, and the organism is stimulated to produce
spores.
