fraction of several samples were kindly undertaken by Mr R. Allen. The results given below
are expressed in the usual way as the Sr/Ca ratio. In calculating the ratio, the small Mg
content of the rocks has been neglected and the soluble fraction taken as CaCO,:

Sr/1000Ca Sr/1000Ca
laminated limestone, Dorset 0-38 normal marl, Dorset 2-00
laminated limestone, Dorset 0:38 normal marl, Dorset 2-00
normal limestone, Dorset 0-38 normal marl, Glamorgan 2-00
normal limestone, Dorset 0-80 Sutton Stone, Glamorgan 0:38
normal limestone, Glamorgan 0-38 primary calcite, Dorset 0-80

The most interesting feature of the results is the consistently higher Sr content of the
marls, a fact for which no satisfactory explanation can be offered. Many more results of
this type are needed to confirm whether this is a normal feature. The Sr/1000Ca ratios of
the limestones are consistently close to the average (0-71) determined for a large number
of limestones of different ages by Kulp, Turekian & Boyd (1952), and are similar to that
determined for a specimen of calcite from a drusy cavity in one of the Blue Lias lime-
stones. The results for the marls, though notably higher, fall well within the range
established by Kulp ef al. (1952). All the results are consistent with the CaCO, having
been precipitated originally as calcite; but, as the Sr content decreases markedly when
aragonite recrystallizes into calcite (Revelle & Fairbridge 1957), the possibility cannot be
excluded that the CaCO, was originally aragonite. If, however, this were the case it might
be expected that strontium would be retained within the rock as strontianite or celestite.
