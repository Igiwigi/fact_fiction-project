Since the above was written, I have ascertained, on a recent visit to Bristol, that the
large steam-ship* now building there is double-riveted, the plates being three-fourths
of an inch thick over the bottom and bilge, and five-eighths thick up to the water-
line. These plates are joined together with double rivets of 1 inch diameter, and in-
serted at distances of 3 inches apart. The proportions appear to be good ; and con-
ceiving the workmanship to be equally 80, I should infer that this fine vessel would
fairly establish the principle, that iron, in all the ramifications of ship-building, is
an article of paramount importance to the war as well as to the mercantile navy.

In the pursuit of the foregoing inquiry, I was naturally led to the consideration of
the best proportions and best forms of riveting plates together. T investigated this
subject with great care, and from my own personal knowledge and that of others,
I have collected a number of practical facts, such as long experience alone could
furnisch. From these data I have been enabled to complete the following Table,
which for practical use I have found highly valuable in proportioning the distances
and strength of rivets in joints requiring to be steam- or water-tight.
