It is not the homologon of
S the peritoneal space of the Asteriadz, as maintained by physiologists, for this space
S as well as this organ exists in Zolothuria. It will be afterwards proved, unquestion-
© ably, that if the office of this © tree” be respiratory at all, it can discharge this function

Z only in a secondary and incidental manner.
2 In the peritoneal space of the Sipunculide there exists a large volume of opalescent
Z fluid, holding in snspension corpuscles of definitive organization ; and yet the bulk
= and basis of this fluid also is salt water (figs. 6 and 7). 'They exhibit a pink hue, like
= those of the blood-proper, figs. 4 and 5 of the Sipuncles.
> They are flattened, irregularly oval cells, bearing a single minute nucleus. These
Z cells, in fact, correspond in every minute particular of colour, structure, figure and
2 dimensions, to those found in the blood-vessels of the same Sipuncle. Wherefore this
FI identity? The question cannot be eluded.
