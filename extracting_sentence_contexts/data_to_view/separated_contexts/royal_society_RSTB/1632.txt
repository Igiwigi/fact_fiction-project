After the shot the pressure rises and subsequently exhibits a tendency to
parallelism, but not so markedly as in the case of the femoral. On examining the ratio between the central and peripheral pressures, we find the
following averages :â€”

| Before shot. After shot, 2-6 mins.

|
Cardiac pressure. 176 253

Peripheral carotid pressure. 1 i

This establishes the fact, above described as being elicited from inspection of the
tracings, that the fall in the peripheral pressure is greater than that of the central,
whereas, in the case of the peripheral femoral, this was not the case. The general
character of the carotid fall, especially the suddenness, suggests strongly to us that
it is in part due to the simple effect of the bullet opening the skull, and also to the
wounding of the branches of the carotid. D.
