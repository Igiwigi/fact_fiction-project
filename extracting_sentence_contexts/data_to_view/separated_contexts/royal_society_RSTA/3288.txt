spanned by all structural (positional) degrees of freedom. The amorphous phases live on a subset
of this surface (a subspace) defined by a limited set of configurational variables accessible inside
this amorphous phase. This is due to the fact that ergodicity is hindered globally in both cases, for
the amorphous phase and for parts of the phase diagram in the supercooled liquid state. However,
the amorphous state is just a part of the overall disordered states free energy surface that is again
locally hindered from exploring the whole disordered free energy surface. Figure 1 shows a limited range of thermodynamic anomalies obtained for the BeF,2 RIM
(i.e. a =0â€”(b)) and the same model with a =5au (c).
