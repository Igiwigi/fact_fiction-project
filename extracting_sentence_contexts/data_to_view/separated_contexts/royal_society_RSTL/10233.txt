The former does not possess the power of creeping but attaches itself
at an early age to 80lid objects in situations where ib is nob likely to be buried. Precisely as we should expect under the foregoing view, the buds of Leptogorgia do
nob appear at, an early period. In my specimens, in fact, they had not made their
appearance at the end of nearly two months (!), whereas in PRenila they appear at
the end of three days. As the buds become older and more fully developed they gradually cease to perform
the function of imbibing water. It is however assumed by younger buds and is in
turn lost by the latter as they become older.
