A moist wing was, therefore,
polished, to see whether the effect would be like that observed in Plusiotis resplendens
(see p. 31). No matter at what depth the surface was exposed, so long as the wing
was kept moist, the colour, strange to say, did not vanish. In fact, a piece of wing-
case was polished until its end was ground to the form of a sharp chisel, exposing the
entire thickness of the chitin. As soon as this was moistened with any fluid it became
intensely metallic and golden. This piece was mounted in glycerol and examined
microscopically, when it was seen that not only was the surface golden, but any cracks
in other planes were metallic also, as if carved out of solid gold.
