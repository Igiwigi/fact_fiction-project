They either fork at their apex into equal
halves, or bear a terminal cupule, in some species they bear a pair of bract-like
structures which will be termed bracteoles, and they often give rise to further branches
lying in the same plane, which are not subtended by bracts and which may have an
opposite or alternate arrangement. These ultimate divisions terminate in cupules. The complete structure must then be described as an inflorescence, but it resembles
a sporophyll both in the restriction of the lateral branches and appendages to one
plane, and also in the fact that the epidermal cells of the axis, as indicated by the
cuticle preparations, often differ on the two sides. The exact structure of the cupules
is difficult to determine. Nearly all the specimens have been compressed and flattened
out in the plane of the branching and they appear to have been basin-shaped, cam-
panulate, or urceolate structures springing from the ultimate branches or pedicels
with their mouths or openings facing the base of the inflorescence.
