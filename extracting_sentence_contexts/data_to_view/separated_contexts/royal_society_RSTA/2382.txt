This suggests that as we increase
y(0) the difference between up- and down-drift further decreases. We show this numerically in
figure 2c,d. In fact, the values of the up- and down-drift change continuously until they coincide
at the balance point y(0) = 6 ~ 0.514 (figure 2e). For larger values, the order of the drifts is reversed
and coarsening leads to another ‘winning’ phase of the solution (figure 2d). Note that throughout this process of the change of y(0), the function fr satisfies (H1) and
(H2), and as a result fy satisfies (H3).
