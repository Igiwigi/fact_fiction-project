Absorption of Atmospheric Oxygen.—This organism is a greedy absorber of gaseous
oxygen. In one experiment a 25 cubic centims. broth culture sealed up in 250 cubic
centims. of air, deprived the atmosphere of all but a trace of oxygen during seven
days’ incubation. The analysis of the gases gave the following :—

A slight film is furmed at the surface and the broth is tinged a

In another experiment made side by side with the next-described organism the
results were, for seven days :—

The diminished rate of absorption is not easily explainable except by the fact that
e second experiment was sown from an older and perhaps weaker culture.

2 This organism, evidently a variety of the one last described, was isolated from a
ralture of that organism which had repeatedly passed through plate culture, and which,
$rorefore, was undoubtedly pure. On making a fresh plate cultivation from a streak
“ube it yielded two varieties of fluorescent colonies, each of which retained its character
£ subsequent cultures. ~The organisms are strikingly alike in their fluorescent power,
‘But distinct. in their gelatine cultures and in microscopic preparations.
