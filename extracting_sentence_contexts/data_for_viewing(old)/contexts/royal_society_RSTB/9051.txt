R . o| A critical point in mammalian development is when the early embryo
eview CrossMark implants into its motherâ€™s uterus. This event has historically been difficult to

study due to the fact that it occurs within the maternal tissue and therefore
is hidden from view. In this review, we discuss how the mouse embryo is

Developmental plasticity, cell fate specification directing and coordinating this crucial event. Prior to implantation, the
and morphogenesis in the early mouse cells of the embryo are specified as precursors of future embryonic and

combination of factors including cell polarity, position and cell-cell signalling
