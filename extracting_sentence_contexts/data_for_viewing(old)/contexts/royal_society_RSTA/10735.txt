& to minimise the objection that has been pointed -out.
3 Before passing to other considerations, two possible causes of error require inves-
$ tigation. If what Smonucnowski bE Smotant has called the discontinuity of
temperature—the equivalent of what is known to electricians as contact resistance —-
& exists between the enclosure and the contained gas, the observations will give results
too low.

This effect, however, is inversely proportional to the pressure of the gas, and
above 1 atmosphere would correspond to an effective increase in the radius of the
enclosure of less than 0:00001 centim. It need not, therefore, be brought into
consideration.

A more serious cause of error lies in the fact that the walls of the enclosure being
2 centims. thick, the inside surface might be considerably above the tempera-
