practice the rapid forward stroke and the slow return stroke can be arranged so that they do
not differ greatly from constant-speed strokes except at the ends, and by making a small
correction for the deviation it is easy to find the time corresponding to any given abscissa
on the record. With the values of the resistances, etc., given in figure 9, 1 msec. corresponds
to about 15 cm. on the photographic plate in the case of the rapid sweep, and to about 1-5 cm.
in the case of the slow sweep.


STUDY OF THE HOPKINSON PRESSURE BAR 401

The photographs of figures 10 and 11 show the types of records obtained when working
on the fast forward stroke and the slow return stroke respectively. In both photographs, the
spots and the lines on the c.r.o. screen are initially at the left of the photographs, and, in fact,
the initial positions of the spot and the line are visible in figure 10. In each case, the forward
stroke is from left to right and the return stroke from right to left.
