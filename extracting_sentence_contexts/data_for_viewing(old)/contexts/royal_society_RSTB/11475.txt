There are two common arguments for why language is not
more iconic than it is. The first is that resemblance between
words and meanings is only possible for a very small range
of meanings, e.g. imitations of sounds in speech and imitations


of shapes in gesture [113]. Although it is certainly true that
some meanings can be ‘resembled’ in gesture and speech
more easily than others (what would an iconic form of democ-
racy look or sound like?), the iconic potential of language is
substantially greater than what is realized in natural
languages. This iconic potential is evidenced by the fact that
people are highly adept at creating and interpreting novel
vocalizations for expressing a wide range of meanings [107].
The second argument against more widespread iconicity
is that if word forms resembled their meanings, then similar
words would have similar meanings, leading to confusion.
That is, widespread iconicity would lead to an increase in sys-
tematicity, which is defined as ‘a statistical relationship
between the patterns of sound for a group of words and
their usage’ [7, p. 604]. Systematicity is distinct from iconicity
in that something can be systematic with or without being
iconic [114]; however, if an iconic crossmodal correspondence
(such as between /i/ and smallness) is productively used by
