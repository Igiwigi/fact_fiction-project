The constantly sharp outline of the mass of moving particles, whatever the actual
placement of its constituents, the persistent central cohesion, not only of possibly
nous matter, but of oil drops or grains of Indian ink, and an occasional lack of
hronism* in action, forbid the hypotheses that aggregation is due solely to the

of a highly elastic lining film. On the other hand, all
