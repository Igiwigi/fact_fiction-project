The Navier-Stokes equation or conservation of momentum:
pd = pF—Vp-+ 40% +4uV4 +2{(Vp) V}9+ (Vx) L-BA(Ve)- (3-2)
The energy equation or conservation of energy:
pe + pd =8+V{(KV) T}. : (3:3)

In none of the references cited above is this equation given in its most general terms.
Careful examination of its derivation shows that (3-3) is restricted neither to a perfect gas
nor to one whose specific heats are constant, but is applicable to any fluid provided E is
a function of T only. The dissipation function is given by

& = wl2V{(9V) 93+ 0 —29V4 —§4?], (3-4)
and is unaffected in form by the fact that viscosity is a variable.

An alternative form of the energy equation can be obtained in terms of the enthalpy; it is

pa —# = 6+. V{(KV) T}, (3:5)
but since in this form it is now assumed that both EF and Jare functions of T only this equation
is necessarily restricted to a perfect gas, but no restriction to constant specific heats is as
yet implied.

There are two main forms of the boundary-layer equations, namely, those for a com-
pressible and those for an incompressible fluid, But in many applications of the latter it
has been customary to ignore the energy equation, and to solve the mass and momentum
equations with only velocity as the dependent variable, and it has been found that this
