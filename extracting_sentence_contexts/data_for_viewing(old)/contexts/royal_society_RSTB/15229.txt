esis) of salamanders may be complex and_ different

[36,39,114], three main morphotypes with similar gross ana-
tomies have been introduced to allow sorting salamanders
according to their morpho-developmental state [36]. The dis-
tinct morphotypes resemble the different morphogenetic
expressions present across different salamanders due to
their distinct heterochronic developments. The morphotypes
used herein (i.e. larval, pre-metamorph and metamorphosed)
correspond to the morphological stages larval, mid-meta-
morphic and post-metamorphic from Rose and Schwarz
et al. [36,49]. The terms have been slightly modified to be
more accessible and to reflect better the fact that some sala-

is bound to one degree of freedom in one plane, namely
pitch in the medial plane. What makes these studies so exciting
is that the sirenid feeding apparatus largely resembles that of
the early developmental stages of many other larval salaman-
ders. These results, combined with our unpublished studies
and observations from other early larval salamander species
from online videos (table 1 and electronic supplementary
material, table S1), seem to suggest that similar dimensionally
complex chewing behaviours might be common among sala-
manders of an early larval morphotype. While the complex
chewing behaviour of early salamander larvae potentially
