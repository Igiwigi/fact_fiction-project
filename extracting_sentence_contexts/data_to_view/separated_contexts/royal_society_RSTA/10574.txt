and its value can be found from (xxxiii.). Knowing ,, %,,, and the correlation of
errors in B, and B,, 2.e., Rg», we can find at once the probable errors in d and Sk.
from (xxx.) and (xxxi.), Thus with very great generality as to the law of frequency,
we can test how far the distribution is a random sample from a population following
any law whatever. Applying the above general results to the special case of the normal curve, we find
since

The result that the probable error of A, is zero, but that of ,/A, is finite, may
appear paradoxical, but it is due to the fact that the errors are treated as small
quantities and f, involves p,°, the square of a small quantity, or one zero, if the
distribution were truly normal. Of these results, Mr. Frion and I have already published with a less general proof
(xxiii), (xxiv.), (xxvi.), (xxvii), (xlii.), and (xliii.).
