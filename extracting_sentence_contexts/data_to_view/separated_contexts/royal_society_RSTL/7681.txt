These plants indicate a fresh-
water formation, as does also a Cyclas (Plate LIT. fig. 10), the shell of which occurs in
the siderite, and which is undoubtedly a freshwater mollusk. These facts, combined
with the entire absence of marine plants and animals, prove to us that the siderite of
Atanekerdluk is most certainly a freshwater depositâ€”probably similar in its origin to
the limonite of onr own woods and marshes. Mr. WurwreR's collection contains fossil plants from two localities on Disco Island,
viz. Ujararsusuk and Kudliset, which is opposite Atanekerdluk and nearly on the same
parallel of latitude.
