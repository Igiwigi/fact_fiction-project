Is this the reason why he so quickly
spotted the gap in Trotter’s reasoning? To complete the story of [8]: Kato successfully completes his reasoning by proving that the
generator A of the limiting semigroup is a restriction of Q (and an extension of D + O), and that
in fact the semigroup generated by A is in a sense minimal. Notably, even if the implication:
convergence of resolvents > convergence of the semigroups is not used here directly, we are in
fact facing one of the predecessors of the Trotter-Neveu—Kato Theorem.

3. Kisynski'’s proof; Sova and Kurtz’s approach

For the presentation of the results in this section, it will be convenient, instead of considering
families of semigroups of operators, to consider their sequences: we start with the semigroups
{Ty (t),t = 0}, = 1 in a Banach space X, such that, as in (2.1), ||Tn(#)|| < Me”; the generator of the
nth semigroup is Ay. Clearly, both Trotter-Neveu-Kato Theorems are still valid in this case, with
minor, obvious changes, such as replacing lim,_,1— by limy 0.
