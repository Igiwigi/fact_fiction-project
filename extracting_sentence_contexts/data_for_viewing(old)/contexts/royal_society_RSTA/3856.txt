spectral efficiency (i.e. bits per second per hertz) could be increased by a factor equal to the
number of transmitted spatial modes [11,12].

One orthogonal spatial modal basis set that could be used for SDM is orbital angular
momentum (OAM) [13,14]. An EM wave carrying OAM has a helical transverse phase of the
form exp(i¢), where @ is the azimuthal angle and ¢, the OAM charge, is an unbounded integer
(with either negative or positive signs) that represents the number of 27 phase changes in the
azimuthal direction [15]. Owing to the helical phase structure, an OAM beam has a ring-shaped
intensity profile with a central null, and its wavefront twists along the propagation direction
with a twisting rate depending on ¢ [16]. OAM beams with different ¢ values are mutually
orthogonal [16], so that beams carrying different OAMs can act as independent channel carriers
for efficiently (de-)multiplexing multiple information-bearing signals [11]. Moreover, owing to
the fact that the OAM spatial domain is independent of other properties of an EM wave,
OAM multiplexing is in principle compatible with other existing multiplexing techniques, such
as frequency or wavelength division multiplexing (FDM or WDM), and polarization division
multiplexing (PDM) [17,18]. Specifically, beams with the same wavelength and polarization can
be re-used by applying different OAM chargers to each of the many beams, enabling a potentially
significant increase in the system transmission capacity.

Applying OAM to enhance classical communication systems has been quite interesting, and
it is especially exciting given that this is the 25th anniversary of the renowned paper by Allen,
working with Han Woerdman and colleagues at Leiden University in The Netherlands [13].
Using OAM for communications was pioneered to a large extent over a decade ago by the
groups of Padgett [9] and Zeilinger [14], and the community of researchers pursuing this area
has grown significantly over the past few years. There has been progress in recent years in SDM
