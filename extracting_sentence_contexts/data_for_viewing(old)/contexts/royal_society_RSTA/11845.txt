An it, and at the base of the section are angular blocks of grey gneiss.
Fe From a study of these sections it would appear that the brownish loamy clay, con-
Yaining gems, has been made up of materials derived from the decomposition of
Rneissic rocks, mixed with a preponderating proportion of clayey matter and
ninerals derived from the disintegration of the crystalline limestone.
Ee Amongst the ruby clays of this deposit are numerous pebbles of quartz and other
rocks, which are completely waterworn, but the majority are not so, whilst in some
mstances scarcely any of them show any signs of attrition. For instance, the
“numerous bluish, opaque spinels are in their crystalline form of twin octahedrons,
whilst perfect crystals of quartz are not uncommon, occurring with a small amount
Sof water-worn pebbles of the same mineral, Also the rubies and red corundum,
Sthough sometimes found in a waterworn condition along with these, have usually,
though broken, scarcely suffered from abrasion in any way. From these facts I
Econclude that none of the minerals in the ruby clays of this deposit have been
“transported to any great distance from the source of their origin, and that the
rounding of some is rather to be attributed to attrition in pot holes, on rock surfaces,
Sin the beds of small mountain streams. The fact of the minerals being intimately
FE aaed with the brown clays, shows also that the whole deposit has been moved down
Athe mountain sides without being submitted to forces sufficient to produce a thorough
re-sorting of the component materials.

On washing the ruby-bearing materials of this deposit, and eliminating the clay
and fine sand, the remaining portion is found to be made up of quartz, gneiss,
pegmatite, black tourmaline, garnet, rock crystal, spinel, and ruby. In some
Hmyaudwins, notably No. 1 and No. 2, a few sapphires have been found, but
