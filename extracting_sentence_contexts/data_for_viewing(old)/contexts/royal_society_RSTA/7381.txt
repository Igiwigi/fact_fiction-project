We have previously considered an ‘average’ obtained by the process of evaluating the
detailed curves for all the separate systems and ‘averaging over systems’. It is now apparent
that the ‘average’ curve can be obtained another way. Let us measure the angular dis-
tribution of power in the spectrum by means of a measuring device which has a finite angular
resolving power so that it accepts the radiation falling inside a narrow range of angles As.
Then as the device is moved through the angular spectrum it will measure a ‘running mean’
over the range 4s.

If the irregularities in the angular spectrum are so widely spaced that they are separated
by an angle much greater than Js, as indicated in figure 1, then the ‘running mean’ over As
will, to some extent, repeat the irregularities of P(s) without much smoothing. These con-
ditions will hold when there is some considerable degree of correlation in the angular spec-
trum so that p,(4s) is not much different from unity. The fact that there is considerable
correlation in the angular spectrum implies that the stop is not too large.

Next consider what happens as the optical ‘stop’ is made wider. The irregularities in
P(s) will assume a finer structure, corresponding to the increasing fineness of the diffraction
pattern of the ‘stop’ itself. Finally, when the ‘stop’ is very wide the structure will become so
fine that there are many irregularities inside the acceptance angles As of any measuring
device we care to use, and all that we can determine is the ‘running mean’ value. In the
limit, for an unbounded irregular screen, although there is zero correlation from point to
point in the angular spectrum, all that we can observe with an instrument of finite resolving
power is the running-mean value and we measure a completely smooth curve.
