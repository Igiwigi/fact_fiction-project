The image reflected from the surface of the pearl is
enveloped in a quantity of unformed light, arising from a cause
which will afterwards be explained; and the very same white '
nebulosity is reflected from the wax.

IIT. On the causes of the Phenomena of Mother of Pearl. From a careful examination of the preceding facts, we must
now be prepared to infer, that all the peculiar phenomena of
mother of pearl, as seen by reflection and transmission, are
owing to a particular configuration of surface ; that the communi-
cation of these properttes to other bodies, is the necessary consequence
of the communication of its superficial structure ; and that none of
the light which is concerned in the production of these phenomena,
has penetrated the surface of the mother of pearl. What this configuration of surface is, and in what manner it
generates the coloured images, are points of high interest, and
of corresponding difficulty. The facts naturally lead us to
conjecture, that the extraordinary reflections are produced by
faces, either curved or rectilineal, slightly inclined to the
general surface of the mother of pearl.
