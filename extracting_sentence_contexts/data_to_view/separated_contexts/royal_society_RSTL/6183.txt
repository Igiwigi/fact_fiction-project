This is verified very simply in the case of the quadrangle. Taking for the two points
of intersection the circular points at infinity, the line joining them is the line infinity,
and its pole, with respect to the inscribed circle, is the centre of this circle ; the relation

. therefore is that the centre of the inscribed circle lies on the circumscribed circle. But,
when this is the case, it is casy to see that the pole (with respect to the inscribed circle)
of the radical axis, lies also on the circumscribed circle; this pole and the centre of the
inscribed circle are in fact the extremities of a diameter of the circumscribed circle. The condition thus obtained is R*â€”a*=0 (which is M. MexrTion's condition 2z=0).
