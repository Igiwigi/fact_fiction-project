for the decamethylene and n-alkyl bromides (Brown & Sheppard 1953, unpublished work),
where the CH, wagging modes give rise to outstandingly strong absorption bands between
1190 and 1380 cm"!.

Unfortunately, the experimental data allow the identification of only a few of the
twisting modes. One limit has already been identified for the CH, twisting modes,
namely at 1300 cm~!. The lower limit has not been observed. According to the selection
rules it should have infra-red-active frequencies only in the even-numbered molecules.
The next series to this, which has infra-red-active frequencies only in the odd-numbered
n-paraffins, has been assigned to a nearly constant frequency near 1175 cm~!. The polariza-
tion data for n-nonane and n-nonadecane show that these absorption bands arise from
perpendicular vibrations, as expected for CH, twisting modes. In general, the CH,
twisting modes give rise to weaker bands than the wagging modes, a fact also corroborated
by observations of the n-alkyl and polymethylene halides (Brown & Sheppard 1953,
unpublished work).

It should be noted that the limits chosen earlier in this section rely on the correct
identification of the series in the early members of the n-paraffins, and that, if these
correlations are not accepted, other schemes are possible. A number of such schemes have
been tried, but they all gave patterns which were either irregular or did not conform with
the infra-red measurements on oriented crystals. The least certain assignment is that of the
second lowest CH, twisting series to the 1175 cm—! frequencies. The most plausible
alternative interpretation would be to assign this series as the lower limit of the CH,
wagging modes, with the 1200 cm~! frequencies as the second series. In this case it must
be assumed that the possibility of extrapolating the 1200 cm™! series back to propane is
