This is indeed a migratory stage par excellence, the unusual duration
of which must be regarded as an adaptation—effected by seleetion—to the distances
of many thousand miles to be traversed. So great are these distances, that the class
of one year cannot reach its goal, the fresh-waters of Europe, until a second and a
third have started on their way. As a matter of fact, we have in early summer three
year-classes of larvee on their journey; the youngest in the western, the next in the
central, and the oldest in the eastern waters of the Atlantic, off the coastal banks of
Europe (¢/., Plate 17, fig. 2). There can be no doubt that a great wastage of individuals
takes place in the course of these years of migration, but it is in all probability
insignificant in view of the enormous production of larvee, of which the “ Dana”
stations in the western Atlantic give evidence. The Anguilla species, in contrast to other murenoids, are usually termed fresh-
water eels, and are reckoned among the fresh-water fishes of Europe and North
America.
