To estimate the contact area of each film, we assigned the x-axis (or y=Onm) of the RMS
roughness profile as the hypothetical plane of contact when the PSA is brought into contact with
an infinitely smooth opposing surface. As can be seen in the RMS profiles in figure 3, the portion
of the film which lies on the x-axis is smallest at the highest CNC loading. In fact, analysis of peak
widths indicates that ca 40% of the film would be in contact with an infinitely smooth surface with
0 and 0.5 wt% CNCs (43% and 41% contact area, respectively). Whereas at 1 wt% CNCs, this value
decreases by almost a quarter to 32% contact area. These specific values are of course dependent
on the AFM image analysed; however, as the images shown in figure 3 are representative of the
sample it is likely that a similar trend exists across the entirety of the sample surface.
