These systematic residuals, which are in most cases quite large, and which are
shown in the same place by all the tension and pressure observations of these glasses,
cannot be chance effects. Neither can they be affected, denoting, as they do, compara-
tively rapid changes in A, by any of the slowly varying corrections which have been
discussed. They can be accounted for only in the following ways :—

(1) Possible erroneous identification of a spectrum reference line in the neighbour-
hood and consequent wrong determination of \ observed ;

(2) Bad division errors of the spectroscope circle ;

(3) Bad error in some of the weights employed at these points ;

(4) Systematic change of personality of observer in this neighbourhood, due to
change of colour ;

(5) Actual variation of the law of stress-optical effect in this neighbourhood.

(1) is ruled out by the fact that in the glass 3453, where the effect was first

noticed, it was discovered, not from any such curve, but from the actual circle
readings of the spectroscope, which usually increased by steadily increasing differ-
ences ; in this glass, just after the readings corresponding to d 5000, the difference
decreased instead of increasing. Readings were taken several times with great care,
and the effect was confirmed in each case. This demonstrated that the cause was
not accidental.
