For since eight lines of A meet LM, eight lines of & meet the polar line of LM with

-respect to U, and the eight planes are the reciprocals of the eight points of meeting ;
but these eight points of meeting lie on a generator of U!V”—U'"V. Hence the propo-
8ition is proved.

Cor. 1. The line LM is a generator of the reciprocal of U'Y”—U'Y!,

Cor. 2, The quadric U'V'—U"V' is the hyperboloid generated by the polar lines of
LM with respect to all the quadrics of the pencil U+FV. In fact the polar lines form
one system of generators, and the intersection of the polar planes of art. 222 the other
system of generators,

Cor. 3. The eight planes of art, 222 are homographic with the eight points in which
the corresponding lines of A meet LM.

224, From art. 161 it is evident that & has sixteen stationary points, These are the
points of contact with N, N', N", N"' of the common tangents of J and N, J', N'; JN";
J”, N”. Hence it follows that A has sixteen stationary planes. Hence we have three
of the characteristics of A; for m evidently is equal to 4, and r=8 from art. 222, There-
fore we have
