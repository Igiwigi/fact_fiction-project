Owing to the extreme smallness of the observational quantities, it would require a
very long series of years to eliminate accidental sources of error. Thus the seasonal
results, more particularly for the non-cyclic effect, are probably affected by consider-
able uncertainties, especially as regards the values of b/a. In fact, my object in
recording the seasonal values was largely to enable the reader to judge for himself
what attitude he should adopt towards the mean results for the year. 2
