However, the resulting large strand
immediately breaks up again into two (text-fig. 17); at the same time the two
mucilage canals (or one in case of fusion) are replaced by several canals of different
sizes which lie in two roughly concentric rings (text-fig. 19). At this level an

important change has taken place in the aspect of the cross-section ; whereas at first
the centre of the figure was towards the xylem side of the strands (at x in fig. 17) it
has now shifted suddenly to the phloem side, and lies in the middle of the group of
mucilage canals (fig. 19). The cells among which the canals lie are distinguished
from the surrounding tissue by their small size, and by the fact that they are nearly
all filled with “resin.” We are now at the chalazal end of the seed, and these cells
constitute the dark internal zone of the fleshy seed-coat, of which the outer limit is
