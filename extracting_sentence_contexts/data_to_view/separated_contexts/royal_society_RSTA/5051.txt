Initial work on the type 1 pilus assembly suggested a possible basis for subunit ordering: the
ordered region of the usher NTD (aa 25-125) interacts only with the chaperone, the disordered
region (aa 1-24) folds upon binding to the subunit in the chaperone-subunit complex and could
be therefore responsible for the discrimination of the different FimC-subunit complexes by the
assembly platform [45]. Indeed, FimD binds to different FimC-subunit complexes with different
affinities, which would be a key element for correct initiation of pilus assembly and for the correct
ordering of the subunit incorporation into the pilus. Consistent with this is the fact that, among
all chaperone-subunit complexes, the chaperone-adhesin complex exhibits the highest affinity for
the usher NTD [49]. However, the rank order of NTD-binding affinities for the other tip fibrillum
subunits does not match the incorporation order as observed in the mature pilus [40,45-47],
suggesting that other factors play a role (see below). Di Yu et al. [34] determined the surface of the adhesin in contact with the NTD in the
usherNTD-chaperone-subunit complex of the F1 pilus system to be only 3% of the total surface
and argue that this is not significant enough to determine the subunit ordering.
