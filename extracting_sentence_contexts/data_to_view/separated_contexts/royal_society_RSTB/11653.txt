The intrinsic rewards are thus
proportional to the learning progress of the Learner, ie. the
more the Learner learns to approximate the appropriate corre-
lations, the higher the rewards. The RL component receives

The term ‘embodied curiosity’ refers to the application of
curiosity-based computational models within an embodied,
physical agent. It hints to the fact that there is a very tight
interaction between the computational model and the body,
ie. sensors, motors and their physical arrangement, as well
as the embedding interaction. One interaction cannot be ana-
lysed without the other, since emerging behaviours are
dependent on both. In this section, these two concepts are
briefly described and reviewed.
