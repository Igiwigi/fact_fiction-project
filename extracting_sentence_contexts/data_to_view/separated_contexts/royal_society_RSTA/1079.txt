In the SDT experiment, the hotwire probe was moved along a single radial line to obtain data
at different locations between the hub and tip. When the radial locations are placed in the volume
at different circumferential locations from 90° to 106°, slight differences in the results are found
as shown in figure 4. The difference is attributed to both the fact that a cartesian grid not aligned
with the wake is used in the gap and that there is an averaging process used when saving the data
into the volume file and an interpolation process used when extracting the data. Note that probe
values are saved without any space averaging or interpolation involved (the value of the probe
containing voxel is used). Figure 4a shows there is no appreciable grid, sampling or interpolation effect present in the
total mean flow values.
