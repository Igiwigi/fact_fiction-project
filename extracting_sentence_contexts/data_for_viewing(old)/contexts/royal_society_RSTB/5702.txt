the olive-coloured rot, and P. italicum Wexner, which is responsible for the blue-green
rot. It has been found in the course of work that each of these species has very definite
biochemical characteristics which are described in this paper.

1. P. digitatum Saccarvo (P. olivacewm WruMEr).

This species was first adequately described by WEHMER in “ Beitriige zur Kenntnis
einheimischer Pilze,” Heft 2: ‘‘ Untersuchungen iiber die Fiiulnis der Friichte,” Jena,
1895. Later, THom (1910), in “ Cultural Studies of Species of Penicillium,” p. 31,
renamed this species on the grounds of priority, P. digitatum Saccarpo.

Physiologically it is distinguished from almost all other species of Penicillium by
the fact that while it grows readily on organic media, it either refuses to grow or grows
with difficulty on synthetic media containing nitrogen as sodium nitrate (Tom, p. 32).

In the course of work described in Part IV of this series on the carbon balance sheets
of species of Penicillium, it was found that three strains of P. digitatum give unusually
large amounts of carbon as “ Carbon in H,SQ,.” The strains used were the following :—

(a) P. digitatum, Catalogue No. Ad. 52. his strain was purchased in 1925 from
the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures at Baarn under the name P. olivaceum
Weumer. It was sent for confirmation to Dr. THom, who wrote, “ Your No.
52, marked P. olivaceum, is correctly named as the olive-coloured rot of oranges,
but the name should be changed to P. digitatum to comply with the rules.”
