436 MR, HIGGINBOTTOM ON THE INFLUENCE OF PHYSICAL AGENTS. At the first I was led to think the absence of light was even favourable to deve-
lopment, but I afterwards found that the difference depended on a light increase of
temperature owing to the vessel being covered. This fact is rendered obvious by the
Plate, in which the temperature and absence of light are fully illustrated. Nottingham,
