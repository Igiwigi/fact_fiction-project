The oceanic tides
produced by a stationary undulation, with its midline of no tide, give tides neces-
sarily differing siz lunar hours from each other on the opposite sides of the ocean. It is high water on one side when it is low water on the other. Now this cannot be
the case all over an ocean which is of different breadths in different parts; nor, in
fact, can it be the case in any part of it. For that motion of the parts of the fluid
which a stationary undulation requires, cannot take place on a shore shallow in pro-
portion to the, depth of the oceanic spaces. Near the shore, we shall have a tide
which is progressive from the oceanic space towards the land.
