The results of 30 comparisons at various pressures have been plotted. The observa-
tions on different days lay on slightly different straight lines, due to small variations
in the setting of the steel yard or in the torque required to turn the piston, and small
changes in the lubrication of the piston by the oil, but each curve was nearly straight
and nearly parallel to a line passing through the origin corresponding to a piston area
of 0-124858 sq. inch at 18° C. The weighted mean of all those results gave a straight line which cut the ordinate

mining the line of closest fit to the observation by the method of least squares. It was necessary to show that the slight variation in the value of b was not due to
temperature change.
