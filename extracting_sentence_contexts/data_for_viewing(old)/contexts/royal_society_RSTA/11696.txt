(1) The corrections discussed on pp. 211-215. The values of the corresponding
rates of flow were practically the same for all the final experiments from which the
specific heats were calculated, so that the correction is one which may conveniently
be applied to the mean value of the specific heat. Taking the mean value of
(0°3) 42/JSQ, . JSQ, for all the experiments at 20° C., we find that the correction to be
applied to the specific heat at this temperature is additive and amounts to 1°3 parts
per 1000. For the experiments at 100° C. the corresponding correction amounts to
3°3 parts per 1000. In the latter case, however, we have the correction mentioned
on p. 214 (lines 7 et seg.), which is subtractive and amounts to 6 parts in 10,000, so
that the two corrections together amount to 2°7 parts per 1000.

(2) A correction for the fact that, in the calibration of the tubes, a linear relation
between PV and 6 was assumed to hold over the range of temperature 0° C. to 17°C.

(p. 221). Taking the pressure coefficient over this range to be 0°003674, the
correction can be shown to be additive and to amount to 1°9 parts in 10,000,

(3) A correction to represent the deviation of the ice-point and fundamental
interval of the mercury thermometer to which the temperatures of the reservoir were
referred from their proper values. The reading of the thermometer at 0° C. was
0:00° C., and the correction to be applied to the fundamental interval was —0:03° C,
