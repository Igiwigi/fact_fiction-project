314 Mr. HaTcneTT's Analysis of

Bucquer says, that when it has lost the water of crystalli-
- zation, it becomes red hot, and melts without being volatilized.

Lastly, M. FoukxcRoy mentions it in the following man-
ner: © As it contains much water of crystallization, it imme-
« diately liquefies by a yery moderate heat ; but by degrees it
« becomes dry, in proportion as the water of crystallization is
« dissipated. In this state it first becomes red hot, and s0on
« melts without being volatilized, according to BucguerT ; but
« M. Baumz' asserts that it is demi-yolatile. Tn repeating
« this experiment I have obeerved, that in fact a part of this
« salt is sublimed, but a portion remains fixed in the vessel, and
« without doubt it is concerning this that BucgueT speaks.” *

When so many eminent chemists concurred in nearly the,
same assertion, I was not a little surprised to observe, in some
experiments (which I made for a very different purpose), that
the whole of the sulphate of ammoniac was not only volati-
lized by heat, but also that the distillation of it was accompa-
nied with some remarkable phanomena.

I therefore diluted some very pure concentrated sulphuric
acid with an equal quantity of distilled water, and having sa-
