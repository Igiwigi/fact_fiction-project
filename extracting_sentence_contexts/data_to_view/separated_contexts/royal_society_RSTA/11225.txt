~Clearly owing to the near equality of o, and o,, the regression of daughter's on
Gmother’s fertility is sensibly equal to the correlation.

2 The probable error of 7,,, is determined by the formula given by Pearson and
-2Frton* to be ‘0101, or 7,,, is four times its probable error.

"2 We thus conclude :

3 (i.) That fertility is inherited in the female line.

2 (ii.) That its effects are very largely screened by the factors to which we have
3 previously referred.

& Had we started with no limitation as to the daughter's family, it is highly probable
that 7. would scarcely have been sensible relatively to its probable error, and,
etherefore, small series without due regard to screening causes may easily lead the
Brecorder to suppose that fertility is not inherited.
3 Supposing we exclude from the daughters the 775 barren marriages, we find the
mean for 3643 cases of fertile marriages to be 5°237. Comparing this fertility with
Athe observed fertility 6-225 of mothers, a superficial inquirer might at once consider
that a diminution of fertility has taken place. The fact is that neither of the results,
M,, or M, gives the actual fertility of the mothers or daughters. These are the
means M”, and M”, of formule (viii.) and (vii.) of the theoretical investigation. Let us apply the theory developed to our statistics.
