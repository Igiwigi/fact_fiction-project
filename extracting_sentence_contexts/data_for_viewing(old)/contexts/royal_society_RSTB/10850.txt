p300 and RNF8 affects the accumulation and functionality of
the CHD4-containing NuRD complex at DSBs.

CHD4 has been shown to affect both the signalling and
repair of DSBs [62,93,94]. The signalling of DSBs involves the
RNF8-dependent recruitment of CHD4, which promotes
local chromatin decondensation to facilitate RNF8/RNF168-
dependent chromatin ubiquitylation and subsequent BRCA1
recruitment [62,93,94] (figure 1). The repair of DSBs by HR is
largely dependent on CHD4 and its interaction with BRIT1
[101]. CHD4’s chromatin remodelling activity was shown to
be required for the recruitment of BRIT1, a key regulator of
HR. In fact, loss of CHD4, similar to that of BRIT1, impaired
the assembly of RPA, RAD51 and BRCA2 at DSBs and ren-
dered cells hypersensitive to PARP inhibitor-induced DSBs, a
key feature of HR-deficient cells [62,93,94,101] (figure 2).
The proper loading of HR proteins by CHD4 requires actively
transcribed chromatin [102]. Paradoxically, however, the
PARP-ZMYND8-CHD4 axis was shown to induce transcrip-
tional silencing in cis at DSBs [61,68,96,99]. This probably
involves CHD4’s role as a repressive chromatin remodeller
[99]. Indeed, recent work implicated an important role for
repressive chromatin in the assembly of BRCA1 at DSBs and
their subsequent repair by HR [103]. However, whether
CHD4 regulates HR by silencing transcription and/or compact-
