Srur, in his account of the roots of Calamites, mentions one point of considerab
interest.t He finds that the woody cylinder of the root is not always median, but
often laterally displaced, showing that it was freely movable within the outer cortical
envelope. This fact finds its explanation now that we know that the middle corte
of Calamitean roots was traversed by large lacunz, and would thus offer little resist-
ance to the displacement of the central cylinder. Srur mentions that some of the roots observed by him bear rootlets, while othe
do not. He is disposed to regard the latter as floating roots, the former as havin o
grown in the soil.
