when it is going round a curve of radius R. Now even if the conductor were of
copper, the slope of potential along it would be, with this current intensity, as much
as 1647. The effects of the intrinsic electric inertia are therefore so far quite beyone
the limit of observation. We have however been taking the electric drift v to be
the only velocity of the ions or electrons. If they possess a velocity of their own i
fortuitous directions of order V, the average centrifugal electric force on an electro
due to the current will possibly be as high as 87/3a.e.vV/R, because change of sig!
of V does not change the sign of the force. This would still hardly be detectab
even if V were comparable with the velocity of radiation.

But an electric force of a cognate kind has in fact already been looked for am
