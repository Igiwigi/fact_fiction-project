§ 24. The effects of temperature, barometric pressure, wind and sunshine on the
simultaneous values of the potential gradient at Kew were also considered in my

previous paper* of 1896, which dealt however only with eye observations at one or
two hours during some months of 1895 and 1896. The results obtained are generally
similar, except that in 1896 I found an apparent association of low potential with
long previous sunshine. Even here the contradiction may be more apparent than
real, as the influence of sunshine may depend on the hour of the day. An intensifica-
tion for instance of the afternoon minimum may be accompanied by a compensating
increase of potential during the night. Considerations of this kind must in fact be
borne in mind in other cases besides that of sunshine.

§ 25. In 1896 I paid special attention to aqueous vapour, as ExNer’s theory, which
associated potential gradient and aqueous vapour in a definite formula, was then
rather in the ascendant. I advanced grounds—whose cogency will now, I think, be
hardly questioned—for believing the theory in its general form to be untenable. The
1895-6 data were from a Kelvin portable electrometer, whose insulation was never
in doubt. The present data are from an electrograph, whose insulation may depend,
especially at night—sometimes it may be feared not inappreciably—on the greater or
less dryness of the air. Also, for one and the same amount of aqueous vapour in the
air, it seems all important so far as potential is concerned whether fog forms or not,
and in the long nights of winter no satisfactory data exist as to the occurrence of fog,
