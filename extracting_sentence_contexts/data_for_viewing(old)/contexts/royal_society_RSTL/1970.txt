and gases or yapours, I cannot help suspecting the action of heat upon them
to be the same, bringing them all into the same class as conductors of elec-
tricity, although with those great differences in degree, which are found to
exist under common cireumstances. When gases are heated, they increase in
conducting power, both for common and yoltaic electricity (271.); and it is
probable that if we could compress and condense them at the same time, we
should still further increase their conducting power. CAGNIARD DE La Tour
has shown that a substance, for instance water, may be $0 expanded by heat
whilst in the liquid state, or condensed whilst in the vaporous state, that the
two states shall coincide at one point, and the transition from one to the other
be 80 gradual that no line of demarcation can be pointed out * ; that, in fact,
the two states shall become one;—which state presents us at different times
with differences in degree as to certain properties and relations; and which
diffeences are, under ordinary circumstances, s0 great as to be equiyalent to
two different states.

442. I cannot but suppose at present that at that point where the liquid and
the gaseous state coincide, the conducting properties are the same for both ;
but that they diminish as the expansion of the matter into a rarer form takes
place by the removal of the necessary pressure ; still, however, retaining, as
might be expected, the capability of having what feeble conducting power re-
mains, increased þy the action of heat. F
