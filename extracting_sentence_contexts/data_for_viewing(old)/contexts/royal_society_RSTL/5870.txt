Yage of development may be readily traced, until the strongly spinous margin, the pro-
Ainent convexity of the rotulz, and the robust shaft with its long conical spines, indi-
Eite the completely adult condition of the spiculum, and in this state the central cavity
Sm very rarely be seen (Plate XXVI. fig. 21).
The growth of these spicula in their early stages is probably very rapid, as the num-
fr of those in the first and second stages is remarkably small as compared with those
S the third and subsequent stages.
S In the inequi-birotulate spicula of Spongilla paulula, BowERBANK, MS., we find a
_ _ of radial canals passing from each end of the central cavity of the shaft to the
Streme circumference of the rotulz; and it is therefore probable that this expanded
gurt of the spiculum is 8imilar in character to that of the folio-peltate spiculum which
E have described page 299, in treating of the spicula, of the membranes ; and that they
Ve, in fact, originally composed of a series of terminal radial spicula expanding and
@alescing laterally, and thus forming one plane circular surface in place of numerous
parate radii (Plate XXVI. fig. 32).

S'This form of 8piculum occurs in the coat of the gemmule of Spongilla gregarin,
SownrBaxK, MS., from the River Amazon. 'The rotulz consist of two thin flat plates
equal size, without any appearance of crenation at their margins. They are con-
6 by a very short thick smooth cylindrical shaft, a slight protrusion of which
Arrough the centre of each rotula forms a very short convex umbo on the centre of each
outer surface. They are very minute; an average-sized one measured, length, 4;oth

of an inch; diameter of rotula, +x5th of an inch; length of shaft within the rotulz,
