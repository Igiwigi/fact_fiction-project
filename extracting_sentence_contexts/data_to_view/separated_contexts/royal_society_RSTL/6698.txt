9. S(m, n,p): the ignification has just been explained ; but as the surfaces S(m, n,P),



MR. A. CAYLEY ON SKEW SURFACES, OTHERWISE SCROLLS. 455

$(m?, n), $(12?) are in fact the subject of the present memoir, I give the explanation in
full for each of them, viz. S(m, 2, p) is the surface generated by a line which meets the
curyes MM, 7, p each once; S(m?, n) is the surface generated by a line which meets the
curye m twice and the curye % once; S$(m?) the surface generated by the line which
meets the curve m thrice.
