Using the IPCC working group 3 approach
[8], involving many more scenarios from integrated assessment models as input to a simple
upwelling diffusion energy balance model plus carbon cycle treatment, the corresponding
budgets for 1.5°C and 2°C were 550-600 GtCO2 and 1150-1400 GtCOp. The uncertainties in the cumulative emissions that correspond to a given transient warming
come from a number of sources, including from the uncertainty in the equilibrium climate
sensitivity (ECS) and ocean diffusivity (or equivalently, the transient climate response in which
these two terms combine) and the relationship between CO2 emissions and atmospheric CO
concentrations. Additional uncertainty results from the fact that a range of multi-gas scenarios
are used when looking at the future and so the fraction of total warming coming from CO) varies
across the scenarios. Uncertainty in the allowable global carbon budget also results from the type
of experiment from which the carbon budget is evaluated, with a difference between scenarios
of increasing warming and those of temperature stabilization scenarios. Uncertainty also arises
from the definition of the metric used to define the budget [9].
