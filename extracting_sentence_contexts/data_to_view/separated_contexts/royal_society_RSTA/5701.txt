And finally, (v):
the direction of the cascade is not determined by these exact laws which can be observed to change
sign, for example in the solar wind for the total energy [88]. In fact, helical invariants in extended
MHD, which covers both the regimes of Hall current and electron inertia, have a more complex Da
behaviour [89,90]. Hg, which in that paper is called ion canonical helicity, is shown to undergo :3
either a direct or inverse cascade (in the latter case when the magnetic energy is in excess), a fact ad
that may be linked to its dominant physical dimensionality as the ion inertial scale varies. This DR
may also be associated with the non-locality of energy transfer, for example in Hall-MHD (see are
[91] and references therein). a)

(c)_ The role of cross helicity :8

The cross-helicity Hc is the correlation between the velocity and magnetic fields. It is a conserved
volume-averaged correlation directly related to Alfv√©n waves and, in the compressible case, to
magnetosonic waves as well [92].
