evolved. At present T do not alter the opinion that I ventured to offer, that the dark
band may be due to interference; but the new facts which have been elicited in relation
to the negative discharge require a further, and probably an extended experimental
investigation, and I am at present engaged in endeavouring to test the accuracy of the
; opinion I have offered, by means of apparatus now in the progress of construction.
107. 1 am aware that in this paper IT have entered somewhat more fully into detail,
when describing my experiments, than is usnal in communications to the Royal Society.
Sut I have been induced to be thus minute, as the subject is novel; and by explain-
Jag some of my experiments in detail, it may afford to others the means of examining
Airectly, and poxsibly more correctly, into the nature of that mysterious force which we
=Rlenominate Electricity, and which is in many respects 80 nearly related to heat, mag-
Hetigm, and other forces, each being, as Mr. Grove has long since shown, convertible
Einto each other; while the fact that a vacuum 50 perfect can be obtained in a closed
Sexe] containing such a substance as hydrate of potassa, would excite a hope that the
-Himit to vaporation, the existence of which Farapar®* and others have, if not proved, at
Sleast rendered 80 probable, may be determined, and even its consequences exhibited by

Aliroct experiment.
