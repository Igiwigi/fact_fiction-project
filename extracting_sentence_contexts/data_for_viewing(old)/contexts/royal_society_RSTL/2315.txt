the largest, and gives off four pairs of large nerves, and, as in insects, was originally
formed of two ganglia. The two terminal nerves (s) from this ganglion, which has
coalesced longitudinally, pass on each side the rectum, and divide each into two
branches. The terminal branch supplies, and is entirely lost, in the rectum and
sphincter ani, and the other supplies the muscles which elevate and expand the anus

* While engaged upon the anatomy of the Lobster I obtained a large living specimen, which, although ap-
parently vigorous and healthy, appeared to suffer but very little pain when pricked or pinched, and was of a
much lighter colour than usual, its whole covering being quite blue, instead of the usual blackish purple,
Upon killing the animal and examining its spinal cords, the motor columns and nerves were of the usual size
and appearance, but all the ganglia of the sensitive columns, particularly those in the post-abdominal region,
were exceedingly small, and each inclosed only a very mall nodule of grey matter. May we not infer from
this fact, that the degree of sensation in the nerves belonging to the spinal column very much depends upon
the size of the ganglia and the quantity of grey matter they contain ?

in the expulsion of fzeces, and the middle lamella of the tail, in which the anus is sitn-
ated. The remaining pairs of neryes (w) are given to the other lamellz of the tail.

All the nerves I haye now described in the Lobster belong to what Sir Cranes
BxLL calls the regular or symmetrical, and come directly from ganglia ; but there are
