spontaneous tumorigenesis [76]. Presumably, decreased ener-
getic demands for cell growth through mTOR inhibition
should also decrease demands on mitochondrial output. As
such, diminished mitochondrial activity would be expected
to prolong survival and decrease tumorigenesis. The anti-dia-
betic drug metformin is an inhibitor of mitochondrial activity
via inhibiting mitochondrial respiratory complex I. It has
been observed that metformin can prolong the lifespan of
mice and reduce both spontaneous and genetically engineered
cancers in mice [77,78]. These observations, collectively,
suggest that diminished mitochondrial output or function
can prolong lifespan and reduce tumorigenesis. Although
these studies do not address Peto’s paradox directly, the fact
that diminished metabolism protects again tumorigenesis
is consistent with a role of metabolism in the rate of cancer
incidence in animals.
