This expression, however, has no definite value. The integrand involves an
infinity at u =p; furthermore, the infinity is of such a nature that the integral

The above integral, in fact, is not a solution of the ‘equation. We are forced to
include a frictional term in the equation. But this corresponds to the actual pro-
perties of the vibrator; we have shown that, but for damping, the natural vibration
would continually increase ; a state of things unknown among the observed effects
of light.
