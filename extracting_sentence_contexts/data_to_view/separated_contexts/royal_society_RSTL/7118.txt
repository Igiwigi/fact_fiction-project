Neither hypothesis is absolutely inconsistent with any known fact, for it is possible
thus to express the symbols of chlorine and nitrogen in every equation into which those
symbols enter; and if it were placed beyond doubt that the true density of chloride of
ammonium in the gaseous condition were 12:88, we might thus accept the fact and
assert that the factors x; and » were composite, 80 that either y=x? and »y=&%, or
y=c%% and y=1, and our view of the possible system of chemical substances, and of
rne laws of combination to which they were subject, would be profoundly modified. I

am far from believing that such is the true solution of this apparent anomaly.
