where 0 depends on the excitation and ionization potentials concerned but varies only
very slowly with T,,,. The applicability of the method is closely connected with the
fact that (64) is explicitly independent of ¢, the proportion by mass of the element con-
sidered. It has merely been necessary to assume ¢ constant in differentiating. The physical reason why observation of a maximum determines the general opacity
coefficient is worth considering.
