Echinus miliaris ? THe Errecr or tHe Presence oF TRIVALENT IONS UPON THE EFFICIENCY OF
Hypertonic SOLUTIONS. In view of the fact that hypertonic sea-water and trivalent positive ions have
antagonistic effects upon the conductivity of the unfertilised eggs of Echinus acutus,
a large series of experiments were performed in order to determine whether the
effect of hypertonic solutions is inhibited by the presence of lanthanum nitrate. The
results as shown in Table XIX are fairly definite, but they cannot, at present,
be regarded as being entirely satisfactory. When the eggs are immersed in a
hypertonic solution containing lanthanum there is often a tendency for the eggs to
behave irregularly after about half an hourâ€™s duration in the solution.
