This latter tooth was, in all probability, a large tooth. There is no
reason whatever to support the view that in a dentition composed of such extremely

wear, considering the age of the skull and the character and position of the facet
caused by it on its maxillary opponent. The only conclusion to be drawn, therefore, from these facts is that, notwithstanding
that there is no true diastema in the maxilla to receive the lower canine, the method
of articulation present in the Talgai teeth must have been similar to that observed in
