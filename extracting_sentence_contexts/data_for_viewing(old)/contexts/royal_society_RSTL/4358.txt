The blue unchanged compound gives with protosulphate of iron a beautiful pre-
cipitate of the same purple blue colour as itself, but this is decomposed by wasbing.
With salts of lead it gives a brownish yellow precipitate, with salts of copper a brown
precipitate, both these being obviously products of decomposition.

28. The purple blue compound dissolved in water speedily becomes red, and when
in this state, a alt of lead throws down a pinkish red precipitate. This red s0lution
however 80on decomposes, a brownish precipitate falling, and the yellow colour due
to a prusside being seen in the solution. If the suIphide originally employed con-
tained sulphuretted hydrogen, a soluble prussian blue is also found in the liquid.
During these changes, ammonia, hydrocyanic acid, and a gas possessing the proper-
ties of nitrogen are given off, In fact, on mixing the solutions of sulphide and nitro-
prusside, it is difficult, even by keeping the solutions quite cold, to prevent the form-
ation of a little ammonia and escape of nitrogen. 'The s0lution of the purple com-
pound in water decomposes eyen under the air-pump, depositing the brown precipi-
tate, and it does 80 immediately when it is boiled.

When the solution is filtered from the brown precipitate, the addition. of alcohol
separates ferrocyanide of sodium. The alcoholic filtrate strikes a blood-red colour
with a persalt of iron, and with sulphuric acid evolves nitric oxide, whieh is immedi-
ately rendered sensible by a protosalt of iron, a nitrite being thus shown to be in
solution. Ammonia cannot be detected in the solation, neither does it appear to any
great extent when the transformation takes place in the cold, though it always does
80 when ebullition is used to hasten the transformation. It therefore appears to be
