It is seen, then, that a comparison of a photograph of any spectrum with the photo-
graphs of the other spectra in which coincident lines occur, will be sufficient to show to
which spectrum a disputed line belongs. It will be also noticed that the three calcium
lines first mentioned are nearly as thick in the lower (ï¬†trontium) spectrum as in that of
calcium itself, while the difference between the thick lines of strontium and the corre-
sponding lines als visible in the calcium spectrum is very great. All these facts are
easily explained on the supposition that the calcium was very much less impregnated
with strontium than the strontium with calcium. In fact I had such faith in the
efficacy of the method, and in the opinion that coincidences are merely due to impuri-

ties, that I did not even consider it necessary to change the poles, but proceeded at once
to place the strontium salt on that which had just before served for the ignition of the
calcium. This at once accounts for the greater impurity of the former.
