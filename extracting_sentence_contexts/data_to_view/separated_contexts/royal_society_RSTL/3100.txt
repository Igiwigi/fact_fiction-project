IT is remarkable that, notwithstanding the great importance of the circulation
in the animal economy, the length of time which has elapsed since its discovery,
and the constant attention it has obtained, there is hardly any department of
physiology respecting which there appears to be greater uncertainty and con-
trariety of opinion than the sources and the nature of the powers on which this
function depends. I propose in the following paper, by comparing the prin-
cipal facts on the subject, and by such additional experiments as seem &till to
be required, to endeayour to determine these points. Much has lately been
written and many experiments haye been made with this view, and it has
become customary to look for the causes which support the circulation to
other sources beside the powers of the heart and blood-yessels. It has been supposed that what has been called the resilience of the lungs,
that is, their tendency to collapse, by relieving the external surface of the heart
from some part of the pressure of the atmosphere, is a principal means of
causing it to be distended with blood, the whole weight of the atmosphere
acting on its internal surface through the medium of the blood which is thus
propelled from the veins into its cavities ; and in this way it has been supposed
that the motion of the blood through the whole of the venous part of the circu-
lation is maintained.
