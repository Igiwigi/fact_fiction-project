(a) Hello and you are...?
Why do animals evolve vocal calls to distinguish individuals from one another?
Many species do not exhibit individual recognition let alone individual vocal

the producers [1]. Certain types of vocalizations (such as song) can also be
cognitively demanding [2,3], requiring nutrients and time [4]. Yet, individual
vocal recognition (IVR), which is the ability to recognize an individual from
others owing to distinctive acoustic features, has evolved multiple times across
the animal kingdom and is frequently found in mammals [5,6] and birds [7,8]
and often in amphibians [9]. Producing individually distinct vocalizations is
likely present in almost all vocalizing species as each individual will have slightly
different vocal production apparatus owing to their unique morphology. Many
studies have shown individual differences in vocalizations of mammals [5], birds
