Although it has not been possible to trace with certainty the former channel between
Old Decoy and this site, there can be little doubt that they do in fact lie in the same
channel. This is of importance because it shows absolutely no trace on the landward side

Cross Bank. About midway between Old Decoy and the Shippea Hill sites the Little
Ouse roddon crosses the artificial structure known as Cross Bank; close to this point a
boring put down in the middle of one of the meanders of the roddon showed the
