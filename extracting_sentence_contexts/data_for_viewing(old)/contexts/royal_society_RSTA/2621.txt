At several volcanoes, ground deformation changes rate and even direction over short time
periods (days to years), and these changes are correlated with changes in seismicity and degassing
that can be used to diagnose the origin of unrest [14,21,41]. We will discuss how these different
datasets can be combined together below in the case studies for individual volcanoes (ยง3).

(iii) Relation to geomorphic uplift

The repose interval between eruptions is frequently hundreds to thousands of years (or longer),
and it may take a similar amount of time to accumulate magma between eruptions. Over
these timescales, geomorphic uplift can provide a record of magma injection. These geomorphic
observations complement the shorter duration geodetic observations spanning years-decades,
but are limited to areas where geomorphic features are created (e.g. shorelines, river and coastal
terraces) and preserved. In fact, uplift of tens to hundreds of metres has been recorded in
some volcanic areas over the past centuries to millennia and have been related to magmatic
unrest without eruption (e.g. Laguna del Maule, Chile; loto (Iwo Jima), Japan; Socorro, New
Mexico) [42-44]. There is at least one example of 20m of uplift being related to non-magmatic
unrest in the Gulf of Naples [45]. On the other hand, there are also examples of volcanic areas
that have little geomorphic uplift (less than a few tens of metres) despite significant or persistent
geodetic deformation rates [46-48]. The inference is that these geodetic rates are not sustained
for centuries or millennia, such that the deformation is caused by transient magmatic unrest or
episodic non-magmatic unrest [46-48].

(iv) Temporal evolution of ground deformation

Several different types of analytic and numerical models can be used to assess if unrest detected
