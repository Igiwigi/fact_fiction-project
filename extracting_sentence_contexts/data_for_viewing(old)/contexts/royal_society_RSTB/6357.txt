But, unlike the goblet cell, there is no extensive rupture of the expanded cytoplasm.
The secretion appears to move slowly out of the cell, followed by the regeneration
of the cytoplasm and the movement of the nucleus to its normal position. It should
be noted that, in mammals, the non-ciliated type, regarded as the glandular elements
of the epithelium, is usually bleb-like. Their secretory cycle and regeneration is
described in detail by Moreavux (1913) in the rabbit Fallopian tube. In the sow,
SnyDER (1923) has noted that the cytoplasmic blebs of the non-ciliated cells do not
take mucin stains.

The significant feature of all the isthmal glands is the reduction in the degree of
secretory activity as compared with the albumen region. Viscous rather than
semi-fluid secretions are revealed by fixation and staining. It is difficult to explain
these histological findings in relation to the well-established fact that over 50% of
the albumen is secreted after the egg leaves the albumen region and that this albumen
is of a thin fluid type. Further, the rate of albumen production has been expressed
by Peart and Curtis (1912) in a parabolic curve, with no discontinuity in the rate
from the time the egg leaves the albumen region to its completion in the uterus. At
least 10Â° of the egg-white is added while the egg remains in the isthmus. However,
as indicated previously, it is not necessary to suppose that egg-white is added in
amounts derived from successive levels of the oviduct and only when the egg is in
contact with these particular levels of its wall. The secretion of albumen appears
to take place both before and after the yolk has passed a particular point in the
albumen region. The mucous region, at its caudal end, continues in activity

until the shell is partly formed. In the absence of any evidence that the isthmus
