The only sources of impurity yet to be examined was the hydrogen. A
glass spiral was inserted in the train between the palladium tube and the pipette,
and cooled in liquid air during the filling. A small quantity of gas was condensed in
the spiral, and the amount of impurity in the hydrogen residue was diminished,
though not entirely eliminated, by this treatment ; facts which at once suggested a
flaw in the palladium tube. The tube was accordingly cut down and examined, and
a crack was discovered. The phosphoric oxide in the drying trains had not been
distilled in oxygen, and was probably the source of contamination.
