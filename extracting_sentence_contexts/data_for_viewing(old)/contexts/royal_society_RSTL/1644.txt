pounds, and which offer decided evidences in favour of an idea

: that has been for some time prevalent amongst many enlight=
bk ened chemists, and which I have defended in former papers
E published in the Philosophical Transactions ; namely, that

& different ele:nents.

ye I shall not enter into a minute detail of the methods of ex-
EZ perimenting that I employed; I shall confine myself to general
Ã¾51 satements of the facts. The common manipulations of che-
5 mistry are now too well known to require any new illustra-
5 tions: and to dwell upon familiar operations, would be to
A occupy unnecessarily and tediously the time of this learned

body.
