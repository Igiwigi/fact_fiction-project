It will be the quadratic invariant of ri+ w%*+tw*E with respect to £, y, £+y+8 being zero ; just as
the quadratic coyariant of $-is the quadratic invariant of rug +8v1\+twt! with regard to the same variables. This latter is in fact reuv+8tvw + trwu..

(®) The intervening covyariantic form of degree 3 in the variables and 5 in the coefficients, viz. THÞ, will

easily be 8een to bi
by Ce LR rsP(wv—w?) +8tr (1w—o?) + tre (wu—we).
