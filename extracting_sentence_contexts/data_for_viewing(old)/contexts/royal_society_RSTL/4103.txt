been 8uccessfully analysed by the latter : but this is a $ubject which would require a
very lengthened examination to render it the justice which its importance demands#,

Having now completed the investigation of the physiological character of the
human organs of voice, and having for the sake of simplicity considered them in
three distinct lights ; namely, as membranous ligaments obeying the laws of musical
8trings, as a reeded instrument, and as a membranous pipe with a column of air
vibrating within it, the results of the various experiments which have been noticed
would certainly seem to warrant the conclusion that each of these views is cor-
rect ; for it cannot be denied that these experiments clearly show the yocal apparatus
to be influenced by the air expelled from the chest in precisely the same way as if it
were a stretched cord, a reed, or a vibrating tube. Why then should we hesitate to
adopt the obvious conclusion that the yocal organs do in fact combine the properties
of these various instruments, and are themselves the perfect types of which these in-
struments are only imperfect imitations ? The error of those who have preceded the
author in this inquiry seems to consist in viewing the organs of voice, not as a com-

of artificial mechanism ; the Abb6, having s0 far completed the apparatus as to be capable of performing almost
any sentence, appears to have destroyed his machinery owing to pecuniary disappointment.
