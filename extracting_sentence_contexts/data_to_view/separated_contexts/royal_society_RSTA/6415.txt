Such
theories will, however, be put aside here. How the physics of the brain makes thinking or
consciousness, as we experience it, remains an unanswered question, sometimes referred to as ‘the
hard problem of consciousness’, the problem of explaining the possibility of qualia (qualitative
phenomenal properties, such as experiment of a colour, say, green, versus its physical nature,
defined by the frequency of the corresponding light) [28]. The appeal to consciousness appears
to be due to the fact that our manifested inner experience is that of consciousness, and not of the
unconscious, usually inferred by theoretical means from our conscious thinking. While assumed
to be responsible for mental processes, the brain will be treated here as, physically, a black box,
relating the informational input and output, encountered from either the outside or the inside of
a human subject. In the present view, rather than merely unknown, the workings of this black box
are beyond conception, in parallel with strong RWR interpretations of QM, where the black box
is that between phenomena registered in observational instruments in quantum experiments.
