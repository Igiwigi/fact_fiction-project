Using semiclassical methods, it is possible to construct
very accurate approximations in the short-wavelength
limit of quantum dynamics that rely exclusively
on classical dynamical input. For systems whose
One contribution of 12 to a theme issue classical realization is strongly chaotic, there is an
exceedingly short logarithmic Ehrenfest time scale,
beyond which the quantum and classical dynamics of
a system necessarily diverge, and yet the semiclassical
construction remains valid far beyond that time. This fact leads to a paradox if one ponders the
reversibility and predictability properties of quantum
and classical mechanics. They behave very differently
