great incidences the transmitted ones, however splendid and varied, all become pale
yellow. When these combinations of glass films are immersed in a balsam or an oil,
their colours whether transmitted or reflected all disappear, excepting a pale yellow
light like that which is transmitted at great incidences. These facts prove, beyond
a doubt, that the transmitted colours, though wholly unlike to those of thin plates,
are yet produced by the same cause and are residuary, and generally complementary
to the hue of the reflected tints.

The analysis of these colours by the prism affords a series of most beautiful and
instructive phenomena, and it is only by coloured drawings that any adequate idea of
them can be conveyed. All the phenomena of coloured media, with bands of various
breadths and various intensities of illumination, are exhibited in great perfection, 80
as to identify completely in this feature the two classes of facts. But what is till
more striking, the colours of the bands are changed, and we thus find that the cha-
racteristic phenomenon of absorption is produced by the action of thin plates. To
such a degree indeed is the change of tint carried, that I have insulated a white band
in the orange part of the spectrum.

Notwithstanding this identification of absorption and periodical action in their pri-
mary features, there are two points of difference which separate widely the two classes
of phenomena. The first of these is, that the bands and tints of absorbing media are
not changed by obliquity, and the second, that the reflected tints are not visible in
snch media. Sir Isaac Nzwrox endeavoured to remove the first of these difficulties
by supposing that the particles of bodies on which their colours depended have an
enormous refractive power ; and M. B1or* has endeavoured to meet it more effectually
