In oe there exists a point &9 in the interior of UM 1 The such that I(&)) < I(&) for all €€

for all t € [t,, 1]. Due to the convexity of I(&), and. the fact that (ug) = = 0, we have

1(E,,) < (1 — te)U(me) + to) = belo) < LE),
thus reaching a contradiction. Hence,

and the minimum is achieved on 4 UM 1 The proving equation (5.3).
In view of equation (5.3), in order to prove equation (5.4) it is enough to show that

inf 1(é)= inf, (6).
