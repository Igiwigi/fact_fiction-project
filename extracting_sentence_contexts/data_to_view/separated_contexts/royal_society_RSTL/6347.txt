The two last increase in
number eastward—that is, with increased proximity to the Cretaceous district—and in
some localities are even more abundant than other detritus. In no instance have I found or heard of limestone-fragments on the Boyey Heath-
field. A transporting current from the north or north-north-east seems to be required to
meet the facts of the case. Were it not for the samples of flint and chert, a moyement
from the west or north-west, or eyen south-west, might have supplied the materials. No agent progressing from any part of the compass between the north-east and 80uth-
west, through south, could haye furnished the granite-blocks or failed to transport large
quantities of limestone-debris.
