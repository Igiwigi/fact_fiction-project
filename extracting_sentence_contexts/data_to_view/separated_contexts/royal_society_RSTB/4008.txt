(a) Double Hydrocale. A surprisingly large number of the larvee developed double hydroccele. Adequate
description of the condition will entail a separate paper, but the following facts should
be noted here, since they have a bearing on the homologies of certain important
structures, particularly the hydroccele, the dorsal sac, the epigastric and the hypo-
gastric ccelom. In perfect double-hydroccele larvee the right enteroccele behaved
exactly like the left one in the following respects: (1) The right posterior ccelom
became cut off completely from the right middle ccelom (¢f. p. 242). (2) The antero-
ventral corner of the right posterior coelom extended downwards and to the left,
further than in the normal condition, forming a ventral “horn.” This horn met and
united near the middle line with the corresponding horn of the /.p.c., and from the
common cavity there grew up folds which finally encircled the rectum (cf. p. 244).
(3) Five hydroccele lobes developed in the wall of the r.mc. (cf p. 243). (4) A
secondary communication became established between the dorsal horn of the r.p.c. and
r.m.c. (of. p. 243). (5) In very late larvee a stone-canal groove and the rudiment of
an axial organ appeared on the right as well as on the left side (cf pp. 256, 257).
(6) A pharyngeal coelomic outgrowth developed from the dorsal horn of the r.p.c.
(cf. p. 259). A dorsal sac or madreporic vesicle was present in the middle line, and pulsated
during larval life with the same rhythm as in normal larvee (see also p. 249.) Series
of sections showed that the sac was an entirely separate structure from either the
left or the right hydroccele.
