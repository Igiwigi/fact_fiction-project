functions on the upper-half plane with well-defined q-expansions and moreover have integral
coefficients. In fact, a lot more is true: up to a possible addition of a polynomial, the quantum
invariants Z, are linear combinations of false theta functions multiplied by a rational q-power (cf.
§2a and [18]). A puzzle immediately arises given the simple result for weakly negative three-star graphs:
what happens when one flips the orientation of the three-manifold? While this might sound like
an innocuous operation, it can in fact have rather dramatic consequences due to the pseudo-chiral
symmetry (or CP symmetry in physical terms)
