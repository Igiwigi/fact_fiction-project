A result of this kind shows
at once the important chemical bearing of gaseous transpirability, and that it emulates
a place in science with the doctrines of gaseous densities and combining yolumes. The cireumstance that the transpiration time of hydrogen is one-half of that of nitro-
gen, indicates that the relations of transpirability are even more simple in their ex-
pression than the relations of density among gases. In support of the same assertion
may be adduced the additional fact, that binoxide of nitrogen, although differing in
density, appears to have the same transpiration time as nitrogen, Protoxide of
nitrogen and carbonic acid have one transpiration time, $0 haye nitrogen and. carbonic oxide, as each pair has a common density. PROFESSOR GRAHAM ON THE MOTION OF GASES.
