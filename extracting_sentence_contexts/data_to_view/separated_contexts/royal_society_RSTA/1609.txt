Furthermore, C, C @ so these
points are not points of global bifurcation in w for @ = (â€”oo,a) x X witha > 0. For the results on global bifurcation (theorems 3.8 and 3.10) obtained here the degree for a class
of perturbations of oriented C!-Fredholm maps of index zero as defined by Benevieri et al. [13,14]
will be used because it is well suited to problems lacking both compactness and smoothness
of the sort treated here. In fact, to keep the exposition as short as possible and keeping in mind
the properties that can be verified in subsequent applications to partial differential equations,
the full generality of their construction will not be used. Furthermore, our assumptions about F
ensure that its restriction to any closed bounded subset W of 2 such that d(W, 3&2) > 0 is proper
and hence global bifurcation in the sense defined above can be proved rather than the non-
compactness of C in 2 that applies when F may fail to be proper in this sense as in [15,16]. Given
a degree with the requisite properties, global bifurcation in the context of C!-Fredholm maps has
been established in several cases [15-17] so we only give details of the modifications that are


required to deal with non-smooth, non-compact perturbations, which are the focus of attention
here.
