5. Case study: solving Khan Academy problems in Peano

The main design goal of Peano is to provide a flexible representation for educational mathematical
domains, both to let us understand how learning in this domains can take place and to facilitate
applications in computer-assisted education. We now describe at our main case study in this
direction: the formalization of the algebra sections of Khan Academy illustrated in figure 1. These

Specifically, we could allow a backward step when all the produced sub-goals can be expressed with already existing objects.
Multiple steps might then be needed to construct the necessary objects to apply a backward step. This would overcome the
fact that, in proof assistants, backward steps typically allow the immediate, arbitrary instantiation of existential quantifiers as
long as the result type-checks, thus allowing infinite options.
