status of free-ranging animals. This approach is especially important when
studying the physiological adaptation for diving [1-3]. In marine mammals
and seabirds, extensive research has revealed interesting adaptations for
diving, such as bradycardia during dives and tachycardia at the sea surface
[4,5]. Among diving reptiles, sea turtles perform deep and prolonged dives.
Therefore, the diving of sea turtles can be a good comparison for the diving
of endotherms, marine mammals and seabirds. In fact, many studies have
been conducted on the diving behaviour of reptiles, including sea turtles [6].
On the other hand, very few studies have investigated the physiological aspects
of diving reptiles. For instance, the heart rates of free-ranging diving reptiles in
the field have only been reported in sea snakes [7], American alligators [8],
freshwater crocodiles [9] and leatherback sea turtles [10]. Owing to the lack
of studies regarding the physiological adaptation for diving in reptiles, there
is a gap in the present knowledge on this paramount topic.

The main difficulty in measuring the heart rate of sea turtles is due to the
presence of the shell. The heart rate can be measured using an electrocardio-
gram (ECG) or pulse wave analysis [11,12]. It is believed that the signals
from these tests are completely blocked by hard tissues, such as bone,
