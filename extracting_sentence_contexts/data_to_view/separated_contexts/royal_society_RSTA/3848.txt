“As this is an event so wonderful as no history can give us an account of the like, so it cannot be
unpleasant to our readers to consider briefly some natural causes which may be assigned for it.” The writer then proceeds to discuss the possible theoretical explanations of this
remarkable phenomenon. He rejects the suggestion that it was due to an earthquake,
owing to the fact that the island was blown into the air. Two other causes are
considered, the sudden admission of air through eracks produced by earthquakes to
vast bodies of sulphurous and nitrous gases in the caverns and hollows of the earth,
producing a violent explosion, and the ingress of water through fissures to the
subterranean fires. He is rather inclined to adopt the latter hypothesis.
