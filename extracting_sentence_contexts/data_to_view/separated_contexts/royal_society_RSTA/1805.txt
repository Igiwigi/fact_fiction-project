It is perhaps desirable to remark again at this point that the numbers in any one
column give no indication of the relative emissions of energy in these wave-lengths,
the properties of the plate being widely different in the three regions of the spectrum
concerned. Comparison is justifiable in rows, but not in columns. Low pressure produces a considerable enhancement of the Sharp series relatively
to the Diffuse series—in fact the intensity is doubled—and a simultaneous reduction
of the Principal series of an equivalent magnitude. A trace of Hydrogen produces only small differences in the relative emission of the
three series, as determined by these lines. The Sharp series is slightly enhanced, and
the Principal series to a somewhat greater degree in relation to the Diffuse series.
