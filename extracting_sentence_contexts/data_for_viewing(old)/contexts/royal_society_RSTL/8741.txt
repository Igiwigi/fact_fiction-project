{The research to which the present paper relates has been made as one of the series
of scientific investigations which the Lords of the Council are pleased to authorize me

probably appear entirely or in part as a Parliamentary Publication ; but the immediate
interest of the facts makes me think that the Royal Society will be glad to be at once
possessed of them; and T therefore avail myself of their Lordships' permission to com-
municate the paper to the Society, —TJour Sox. ]
