From the peculiar struc-
ture of the lungs, these changes are rapidly effected, particularly at the high tempe-
rature of 98*; and when the process is fully completed, we know from the great
discovery of Harvey, that the blood which has received the pure air passes rapidly
on to the arterial, and from this again to the capillary system. If the above theory be correct, it follows that the blood is converted from arterial
to venous in the extreme circulation, by the loss of oxygen and the addition of car-
bonic acid; whilst the yenous blood is converted into arterial, by the loss of carbonic
acid, and the addition of oxygen; consequently, the essential difference betwixt venous
and arterial blood is, that the former contains carbonic acid, and the latter oxygen. I have said that black is the natural colour of the colouring matter ; but when this
agent is diffused in a saline fluid, such as the serum, it is of a bright scarlet tint,
which is, in fact, the natural colour of arterial blood. When carbonic acid is added
to this blood in the extreme circulation, it becomes dark red; but when this acid is
removed in the pulmonary organs, the blood then resumes its natural scarlet or
arterial colour; and this, as I have said, is produced not directly by oxygen, but
chiefly, if not entirely, by the action of the salts of the blood on the colouring matter. 222
