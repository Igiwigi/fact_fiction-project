The nature of this volatile acid has not been investigated, but if it were desired
to do so it is obvious that the two species, Ag. 81 and Ag. 83, would be the
most suitable for the purpose, since the “‘ carbon in volatile acids” is 0-198 and
0-212 gm. respectively, corresponding to yields of 8-0 and 7-2 per cent. of the sugar
fermented. Hach of the five species in this sub-group also gives rise to moderate
amounts of “ carbon unaccounted for,”’ though in no case is this very large, since the
maximum is 0-411 gm. with F. species, Ag. 80, corresponding to 18 per cent. of the
sugar fermented. Further indication that these species may be regarded as a separate sub-group
is the fact that while all of them give rise to larger weights of mycelium than the

majority of the other species of Fusariwm investigated, the amount of glucose
metabolized by them is small. The amount of “ volatile neutral compounds ”’ formed by
these five species is also very much less than the average for the remainder, and their
respiration coefficients are very much lower than those of the other species. Another sub-group might be formed of the following species :—F. uncinatum,
Ag. 75; F. trichothecioides, Ag. 73; F. tubercularioides, Ag. 72; F. ceeruleum, Ag. 65;
