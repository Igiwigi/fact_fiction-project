the vessel, since this protracted increasing of the pressure in a vacuum was not
observed after a wire had been heated in other gases. Even if the above large
amount of gas has to be got rid of the rate of escape seems very slow; in fact, the
numbers show thai the law for the rate of diffusion of hydrogen through hot platinum
obtained by Rrcarpson, Nicot and ParNnevL* at pressures greater than 1 millim.
does not hold at low pressures. It is probable that at these pressures it is necessary
to take external dissociation into account (vide loc, cit.). Whilst the preceding measurements of the rate of evolution of hydrogen were
being recorded, readings of the current with â€”18 volts on the filament were taken
simultaneously.
