The vulnerability to Lassa fever in Nigeria shows
the rate A (e.g. the reservoir population size Nr and the a marked decrease during the time of the epidemics com-
prevalence of the infected reservoir Prg(Np)) can be seasonal pared with the vulnerability for Sierra Leone (1). The
(leading to an in-homogeneous Poisson process) and decreasing trend in Nigeria is largely driven by the fact that

stochastic (leading to Cox processes, and if the rate A is a the number of fatal cases decreases with time, although the


number of detected cases also increases. The reasons are not
entirely clear, but we suspect that this is owing to the fact that
Lassa fever in Sierra Leone might not prompt any exceptional 7-
response (being hyperendemic in that area), while in Nigeria
the outbreak triggered a stronger response, especially follow-

ing the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak. The uncertainty decreases 6-

with time, reflecting the increasing number of detected cases 2

and of fatal cases out of the detected ones, which reduces @ 5

the uncertainty in the estimation. 3 aa
For Ebola in Sierra Leone (figure 2), we consider only the 3

severe situation, as no information on detection and the prob- 4-

ability of natural recovery was available to the authors
(vulnerability for the general case can be readily estimated
as soon as these data become available). Vulnerability 3-
increased sharply during the 2015-2016 epidemic, reaching
a higher value than that estimated for Lassa fever.
