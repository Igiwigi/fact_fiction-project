Historic
warming (of about 1.2°C) is the dominant factor leading to 1.5°C (e.g. [56]), given that we are only
a few tenths of a degree from the 1.5°C limit (https: // www.globalwarmingindex.org/). CO2-we
emissions simply generalize this point to allow us, cogently, to include shorter lived greenhouse
gases into the cumulative emissions concept, which is not possible with the conventional use of
the GWP100 metric. Assessments based only on contemporary annual or future projected emissions will mask
the fact that cumulative CO2 emissions result in the vast majority of global warming globally
(figure 1b) and for developed countries [57], and that a significant amount of warming caused
by the biggest historical emitters is from emissions that occurred before even 1990: US (25%
of total cumulative CO) emissions), EU28 (22%) and China (13%) (OurWorldInData.org). In
order to accurately evaluate contributions towards climate change, a consistent approach to
temperature should be applied to both CO2 and CHy, with the same base year. Using CO2-
we, temperature effects can be explored over any period of interest without the need to
run a multi-component climate model.
