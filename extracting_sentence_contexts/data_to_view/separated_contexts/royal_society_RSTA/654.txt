It
leads to frequent violations of the conservation theorem and cannot be relied upon even to give the
detailed shape of cross-section against energy curves. By generalizing from the evidence collected, an attempt is made to specify the conditions under

which the Born and Oppenheimer approximations are most reliable; on this basis, proposals for
systemization are made. Attention is drawn to the fact that some (but by no means all) of the observed excitation functions
possess an extremely sharp peak just beyond the critical potential. The theory seems unable to
reproduce this peculiar feature. It does not appear in the observed ionization functions.
