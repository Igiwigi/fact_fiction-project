This possibility is absent when the photoexcitation is at low energy. So in
this case of an ‘on’ state there can be a difference in the log-log plot, depending
on the excitation energy. There are several additional facts that reflect on the mechanism. The §, to P,
transition seen in figure 6 is known from a S, — P, infrared absorption spectrum
occurring when a hole is deliberately created by coating the surface of the QD
with a thiocresol. A photoexcited thiocresol readily loses an electron to the S.
state in the conduction band to the QD (Shim & Guyot-Sionnest 2000), and
so the S, > P, optical transition can be observed.
