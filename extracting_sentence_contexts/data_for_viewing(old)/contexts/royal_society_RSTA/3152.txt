of things.

The axioms of geometry and of physical disciplines, Hilbert said, ‘express observations of facts
of experience, which are so simple that they need no additional confirmation by physicists in the
laboratory’.

The empirical character of geometry has its clear expression in the importance attributed
to Gauss’s measurement of the sum of angles of a triangle formed by three mountain peaks
in Hannover. Hilbert found these measurements convincing enough to indicate the correctness
of Euclidean geometry as a true description of physical space. Nevertheless, he envisaged the
possibility that some future measurement would yield a different result. This example would
arise very frequently in Hilbert’s lectures on physics in years to come, as an example of
how the axiomatic method should be applied in physics, where new empirical facts are often
found by experiment. Faced with new such findings that seem to contradict an existing theory,


the axiomatic analysis would allow making the necessary modifications on some of the basic 8 |
assumptions of the theory, without, however, having to modify its essential logical structure.

Hilbert stressed that the axiom of parallels is likely to be the one to be modified in geometry if “3

new experimental discoveries would necessitate so. Geometry was especially amenable to a full : o

axiomatic analysis only because of its very advanced stage of development and elaboration, and :<
