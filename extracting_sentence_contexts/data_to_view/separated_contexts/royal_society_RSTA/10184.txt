The direction of the wind appears to have an influence on the radio-activity, for
the latter is at a maximum with a south wind and a minimum with a north wind. Tt is very questionable if this is a real effect or only a re-statement of the relation
between radio-activity and a rising or falling barometer, for every case of a north
wind was accompanied by a rising barometer and nearly every case of a south wind
by a falling barometer. That it is not the other way about is seen from the fact
that observations taken with no wind show an unmistakable relation between the
radio-activity and a rising or falling barometer. TaBLe XXIII.—Radio-activity and Wind Direction.
