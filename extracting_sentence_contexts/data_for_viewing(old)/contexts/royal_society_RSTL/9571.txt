STRUCTURE OF THE CORTEX CEREBRI. 61

SUMMARY.

In conclusion it will be well to summarise briefly the chiefs facts of interest which

have resulted from these investigations. These may be stated as follows ;—

1. A five and a six-laminated cortex is found in all the animals examined.

2, The fundamental structure of the layers is very similar in all.

3. Divergence in type is induced through varied character and distribution of the
elementary units of these layers.

4. As in Man $0 in other animals variations in laminar type centre about the mid-
regions of the cortex.
