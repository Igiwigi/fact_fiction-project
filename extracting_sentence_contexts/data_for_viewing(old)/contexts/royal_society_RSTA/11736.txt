276 MR. J. LARMOR ON A DYNAMICAL THEORY OF

61. It is the circumstance that the available energy A of $51 is a function of the
bodily configuration and constitution of the system, whose alteration by dilution is
independent of the nature of the solvent provided the solution is sufficiently dilute,
that makes osmotic pressure independent of the solvent and therefore the same as the
corresponding gas-pressure. This is of course different from asserting that the whole
available energy of a dissolved substance is the same as its available energy at the
same density in the free gaseous state. In fact the difference between these energies
may be estimated from a knowledge of the solubility : thus the available energy per
unit mass of the gas in the solution at its actual density p’ is equal to that of the
same gas in the free space at the corresponding density p; so that the available
energy per molecule of the dissolved gas is equal to that of free gas of its own density
and temperature together with R,T log p’/p and also R,T for the volume occupied by
the free gas. This makes in all for the excess of available energy, per molecule, of
the dissolved gas R,T log ep'/p, or R,T log es, where s is the solubility and R, is a
gas constant the same for all kinds of molecules. Like information is derivable from
the ratio of partition of any dissolved substance between any two solvents which do
not intermix: its available energy per unit mass must in the state of equilibrium be
the same in both solutions.
