in the notation of §§ 8 and 9, a standing (as before) for the distance between nodal points. This formula is very convenient in practice, used in conjunction with a table of squares
and square roots. Some ‘smoothing’ of results may be necessary (it will be realized
that we are in effect performing a double differentiation of the computed /), and in this
connexion (when high accuracy is wanted) use may be made of the fact that log A, like
f, is a plane-harmonic function of x and y.*

Geometrically interpreted, his the ratio in which the sides of an infinitesimal rectangle
are altered when the curvilinear is transformed into a rectilinear map as indicated in
figure 1. The scale of the rectilinear map can of course be chosen arbitrarily: in figure 8,
numbers attached to the bold-line contours give values of h on the assumption that
h = 1 in the region of the “web” of the rail section, where the contours of « and / are
approximately straight.
