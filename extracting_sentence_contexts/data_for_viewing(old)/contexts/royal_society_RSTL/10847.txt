The first of these two cycles agrees in character with the preceding ones ; we are,
in fact, still dealing with annealed, not drawn wire. But the cycle 0-10-0 begins
the wire's passage from the annealed to the hard state, and the curves of magnetigm
exhibit a corresponding transition. The next stage in the loading, up to 11 kilos,
caused a decided drawing out, and with it a complete transformation of the curyes into
the form which has been already described ($ 71) as characteristic of a stretched piece,
and substantially the ame form was retained with further successive additions of load.
The load was progressively raised to nearly 15'8 kilos. Each step caused 50me
additional stretching, and the act of stretching was accompanied each time by ® fall
of magnetixm. The curves of fig. 36, showing the effects of successive cycles of
loading, consequently became lower and lower as the operation was continued. The
position of the maximum point, either on the on or the off curve, shifts out to the
right—that is, it occurs with a higher value of the load, as the cycle of loads 18
extended. The broken lines in the figure refer to the changes which took place while
