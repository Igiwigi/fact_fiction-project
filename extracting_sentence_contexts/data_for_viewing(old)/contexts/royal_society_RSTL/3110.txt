DISRUPTIVE DISCHARGE—GLOW—PRODUCED AND FAVOURED. 135

of an inch in diameter, with a rounded termination, was rendered poxsitive in free air,
it gave fine brushes from the extremity, but occasionally these disappeared, and a
quiet phosphorescent continuous glow took their place, covering the whole of the end
of the wire, and extending a very small distance from the metal into the air. With
a rod 0-2 of an inch in diameter the glow was more readily produced. With till
smaller rods, and also with blunt conical points, it occurred till more readily; and
with a fine point I could not obtain the brush in free air, but only this glow. The
positive glow and the positive star are, in fact, the same.

1528. Increase of power in the machine tends to produce the glow; for rounded
terminations which will give only brushes where the machine is in weak action, will
readily give the glow when it is in good order.

1529. Rarefaction of the air wonderfully favours the glow phenomena. A brass
ball, two and a balf inches in diameter, being made positively inductric in an air-
pump receiver, became covered with glow over an area of two inches in diameter,
when the pressure was reduced to/4'4 inches of mercury. By a little adjustment the
ball could be covered all over with this light. Using a brass ball 125 inches in
diameter, and making it inducteously positive by an inductric negative point, the
phenomena, at high degrees of rarefaction, were exceedingly beautiful. 'The glow
