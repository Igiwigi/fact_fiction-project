academicians who made that experiment, and who made it with
a direct view to determine the fact in question, were 80 com-
pletely blinded by their prejudices respecting the nature of heat,
that they did not believe the report of their own eyes; but,
regarding the reflection and concentration of cold (which they
considered as a negative quality) as impossible, they concluded,
that the indication of such reflection and concentration, which
they observed, must necessarily have. arisen from some error
committed in making the experiment.

Happily for the progress of science, the matter was. again
taken up, about twenty years ago, by Professor PicTET; and
the interesting fact, which the Florentine academicians would not
discover, was put beyond all doubt. But till, this ingenious and
enlightened philosopher did not consider the appearances of a
reflection of cold, which he observed in his experiments, as
being real ; nor was he led by them to admit the existence of
frigorific emanations from cold bodies, analogous to those calo-
rific emanations from hot bodies, which he calls radiant heat.
He every where speaks of the reflection of cold (by metallic
mirrors) as being merely apparent ; and it is on that supposition,
that the explanation he has given of the phenomena is founded.

On a supposition that the caloric of modern chemists has any
real existence, and that heat, or an increase of temperature in
