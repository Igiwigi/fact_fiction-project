In
any case, whether true or not, the function which this view ascribes to the pituitary would be confined to
the epithelial tissue of the gland, and could have nothing to do with the infundibular part, in which alone
the active agents which influence the circulation and renal secretion are found. The second view supposes the pituitary body to have some ill-defined influence upon the nutrition and
growth of the extremities and especially of the bones. It is based upon the fact that, as was first noted
by Marnie, the condition of acromegaly or gigantism is frequently found to be associated with tumours of
the pituitary body.t The character of the tumours which have been found has varied greatly, and
certainly in most cases their ultimate effect must have been to destroy the normal tissue ; but whether
this was preceded or not by a condition of the gland which was characterised by simple hypertrophy
cannot be affirmed. Assuming that the internal secretion of the pituitary exerts some influence upon the
growth of bones, it is not known whether the changes which occur have been produced by an increase in
the secretion or by its abolition.{ And a similar remark applies to this theory as to the other one, viz.,
that whether true or not of the epithelial portion of the gland, it would not invalidate the conclusion
which is indicated by our experiments, that the internal secretion of the infundibular portion is ancillary to
the functions of the renal organs.
