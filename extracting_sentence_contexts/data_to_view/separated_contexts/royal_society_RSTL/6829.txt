the equation of the scroll is
(aa*+2hay +by* +2920 + 2fy2)*

+2(a93*+2hay + by*+ 29zx + 2fy2)(lz+my)w

+ (aa*+2hay+0b)du*=0. And we see from the equation that the surface contains the line (y=0, y=0) as a double
line, the conic

w=z0, aa*+2hay+by*+ 2gzx + 2fyz=0
as a double curve, also the conic

2=0, aa*+2hay+by* + 21aw+2myw+du*=0

-as a simple curve on the surface,â€”the complete intersection by the plane 2=0 being in
"fact the last-mentioned conic, and the pair of lines

2=0, aa*+2hay+by*=0. Quartic Scroll, Eighth Species, $(1, 3*), with a directris line, and a directriz skew
