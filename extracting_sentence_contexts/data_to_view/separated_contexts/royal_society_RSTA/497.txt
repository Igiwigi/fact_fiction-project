Accurate measurements of diffuse lines cannot be expected. Moreover, in a spectrum as
dense as that of copper, there must be much overlapping of wide lines which no device can
resolve. Such observational difficulties impose definite restrictions on the analysis of the
spectrum, and they are hardly counterbalanced by the fact that the line widths are a guide
in judging the reality of a level. In a spectrum of sharp lines accurately measured, like iron,
the numerical accuracy of the combinations is of primary importance, but in copper a
much more detailed study of the characteristics of the spectrum is necessary. The wave-lengths used are derived from several sources.
