signal tends to be underlined. For example, in a laboratory
study investigating the possibilities of habituation to
repeated painful stimuli, and which describes evidence
for some habituation, the authors write ‘Whereas in most
sensory systems habituation dominates, sensitization is
the prominent phenomenon in the nociceptive system’.
[56, p. 308]. In the spectrum of cosmetic manipulations, ran-
ging from tweezing to piercing, a typical directive is not
‘Prepare for this to become worse and worse’, but rather,
‘This may hurt at first, but you'll get used to it’, which
may be an attempt to invoke the placebo effect, but several
aspects of this are worth study. The questions arising are
first, whether habituation does in fact occur routinely,
second, whether expectations matter, and finally, what is
the role of direct agency? In many such cases, the client is
only directing that a procedure be performed, and not actu-
ally performing it, a distinction of import for the
mechanism proposed here.

(iii) In the case of self-harm, an interesting recent report ‘The
dynamics of pain in non-suicidal self-injury’ [57] found
that about a third of the individuals reported no pain
(pain analgesia) during their episodes, and that those
were the most likely to continue the behaviour (though,
the majority did report pain). Though the possibility of
