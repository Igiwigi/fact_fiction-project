496 PROFESSOR BOOLE ON THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS.

We learn by the last proposition that the system of equations giyen is already a com-
plete system. For, applying the theorem of derivation to any two equations contained
in it, we have a result of the form

; [[H, H,JP]=0;
but this is identically satisfied by virtue of the connected condition.

Instead, however, of solving the equation as a complete system, let us, with Jacopr,
deduce a new integral of the first partial differential equation of the system, 7. 6. an
integral distinct from I, Hs, ... Hm which, in virtue of the condition given, are already
integrals of that equationâ€”in fact, common integrals of the system. For if we make
P=H, in any of the equations, that equation will be identically satisfied.

Represent by AEM
this new integral. It may happen that it proves on trial to satisfy all the other equa-
tions. In that case a common integral is found and the problem is solved. Suppose,
however, the new integral of the first equation not to be a common integral, and, con-
structing the equation [z, P]=0, incorporate it with the giyen system of equations 50
as to form the larger system

[Hy P]J=0, [Hz P]=0;). [H,, Pl=0w, P]=0 Sn
Any common integral of this system will be also a common integral of the given system
which is contained in this one.
