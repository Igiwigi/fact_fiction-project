geochemistry could be reconciled in a coherent picture of lithosphere structure, evolution and
geological history that is more robust than any obtained from one of those disciplines alone.

Since that review, abundant new and high-quality data have clarified patterns, led to new
insights and revealed new links between observations in other subject areas. Some of the
conclusions in that review have (of course) also been challenged. One purpose of this paper is to
review and update those developments. Many of them have already been published in detailed
studies of particular datasets, regions and phenomena. The aim here is again to demonstrate
the link between disciplines, and how insights in one subject area influence those in another.
To make the overview and reference list manageable in size, many of the original references
are omitted here, though they are included in the studies to which we refer. Furthermore, in
order to maintain an overall narrative, it may appear that one insight inevitably led to another, in
purposeful pursuit of a grand ultimate goal. That impression is erroneous: in fact, developments
occurred by investigating something that was not understood, which often revealed something
else that was relevant and not understood either; leading attention in directions that could not
necessarily have been foreseen. Productive research often follows such an unexpected path in
Earth Sciences.

3. Earthquake-depth distributions

Maggi et al. [41] noticed that the depth distribution of well-determined, moderate-sized
(Mw approximately 5.2-7.0) earthquakes on continents showed two patterns. In most places,
earthquakes are confined to the upper 10-20km of the crust (a pattern known from at least
