Thus
a sort of comparison is established between a thermo current on the one hand, and a
current due to the joint effects of chemical action on iron and contact of iron and
platinum on the other. Now considering the admitted weakness of a thermo current,
it may be judged what the strength of that part of the second current due to contact
can, at the utmost, be; and how little it is able to account for the strong currents
produced by ordinary voltaic combinations.

1851. If for a clean iron wire one oxidized in the flame of a spirit-lamp be used,
being associated with platinum in pure strong nitric acid, there is a feeble current, the
oxide of iron being positive to the platinum, and the facts mainly as with iron. But the
further advantage is obtained of comparing the contact of strong and weak acid with
this oxidized wire. If one volume of the strong acid and four yolumes of water be
mixed, this solution may be used, and there is eyen less deflection than with the strong
acid: the iron side is now not sensibly active, except the most delicate means be used
to obserye the current.
