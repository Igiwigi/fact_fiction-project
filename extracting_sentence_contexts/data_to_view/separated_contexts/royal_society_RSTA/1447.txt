The matter lends itself to hilarious observations: the rate of drowning by
falling in a pool appears tightly correlated with Nicolas Cage’s movies: unless one assumes that
Cage’s movies are so badly received as to induce some to drown themselves, there is little question
that this is an FC. This case is trivial, but the general problem is not: distinguishing between TC’s
and FC’s is an art, as the problem is both hard and important. The embarrassing fact is that FCs grow much more rapidly with size of dataset under
investigation than the true ones (the nuggets). As recently proven by Calude & Longo [8] the
TC/FC ratio is a very steeply decreasing function of data size. Meng, on the other hand, has
shown that to be able to make statistically reliable inferences one needs to have access to a
very substantial (i.e. greater than 50%) fraction of the data on which to perform one’s machine
learning [9].
