symmetry, as it is critically dependent on the telltale quantum feature—entanglement. Envariance :3
sheds new light on the origin of probabilities relevant for the everyday world we live in, e.g. : =
for statistical physics and thermodynamics. Moreover, the fundamental derivation of objective 13
probabilities allows one to discuss information flows in our quantum Universe, and hence 1
understand how the perception of classical reality emerges from the quantum substrate. DS

(c) Classical reality via quantum Darwinism Dh

Even preferred quantum states defined by einselection are still ultimately quantum. Therefore, :3
they cannot be found out by initially ignorant observers through direct measurement without :
getting disrupted (reprepared). Yet, the states of macroscopic systems in our everyday world seem
to exist objectively—they can be found out by anyone without getting disrupted. This ability to
find out an unknown state is in fact an operational definition of ‘objective existence’. So, if we are
to explain the emergence of everyday objective classical reality, we need to identify the quantum
origin of objective existence.

We shall do that by dramatically upgrading the role of the environment: in decoherence theory,
the environment is the collection of degrees of freedom where quantum coherence (and hence
phase information) is lost. However, in ‘real life’, the role of the environment is in effect that
of a witness (e.g. [17,23]) to the state of the system of interest, and a communication channel
through which the information reaches us, the observers. This mechanism for the emergence of
the classical objective reality is the subject of the theory of quantum Darwinism.
