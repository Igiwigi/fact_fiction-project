To illustrate the increase in size of the electrical elements, a point of considerable
importance, I have introduced four figures (Plate 29, figs. 17-17c), which represent
four discs from fish varying from 45°5 centims. to 182 centims. in length. Fig. 17
represents one of the largest and best-formed discs from the organ of a Skate
(2. batis) 45°5 centims. (18 inches) in length; fig. 17a, from a fish 61 centims.
(2 feet) in length; fig. 17), from a fish 91 centims, (8 feet) in length; while fig. 17¢
represents a disc from a fish 182 centims. (6 feet) in length. All the figures were
drawn to the same scale, with the aid of a camera, and in each case the posterior
or alveolar aspect is represented. The increase in size between the 18-inch and the
6-foot fish is very striking.

Taking all the facts given above into consideration, it appears that, as already
stated, from a morphological point of view the electric organ of R. batis is as
complete and elaborate as the organ of the Torpedo, and that, as in the Torpedo, it
increases in dimensions as the fish increases in size. Further, from the observations
of SANDERSON and Gorcu, the Skate’s organ is, from a physiological point of view, as
perfect as the Torpedo’s organ; this does not imply that the Skate’s organ is as
useful as the Torpedo’s, or even that it is of any service whatever. The electro-
motive force of the shock, i.e., the electromotive force corresponding to 1 centim. of
the Skate’s organ has been “roughly estimated to be about half a volt. In Torpedo
it is probably ten times as much.”t This difference, I believe, from a comparison of
the two organs, is sufficiently accounted for by the difference in the size and

* For example, the area of typical discs in a Skate 61 centims. (24 inches) in Jength, is from °8 to
