lower temperatures and dT;/dH is negative. The corresponding total entropy diagram is shown
in figure 1f. In the ideal case, the S(T) diagram has the shape of a parallelogram too, but in
comparison with figure 1d the green and the orange curves are swapped. As a result, the adiabatic
temperature change AT,q is negative and the isothermal entropy change AS, is positive. Again,
the first- and the second-order transitions are overlapping, which can be seen by the increased
magnetization in magnetic fields in figure le and by the crossing of the green and the orange S(T)
curves in figure 1f. It is worth noting that both the curves come together again for temperature
well above the Curie point.

The situation changes with magnetocaloric materials of first order, which show a thermal

hysteresis. This means that the back and forth transformation does not take place at the same : =
temperature. In fact, the heating and the cooling branch of the magnetization curve are separated : S
by the thermal hysteresis, which is illustrated for a conventional first-order transition in figure 2a. : 2
The corresponding S(T) diagram is shown in figure 2b. Such a behaviour is, for instance, : &
observed in certain Fe2P-type materials or in Laâ€”Fe-Si [32]. Owing to the existence of the thermal 22
hysteresis, the entropy curves under heating and cooling also do not coincide. This has far- : S
reaching consequences for the MCE under magnetic-field cycling. If there is no thermal hysteresis : s
related to the transition, then the ATaq and ASm as shown in figure 1a-f would be the same in : B
the cyclic operation. But, due to the hysteresis, a reversible effect can only be obtained in the : s
highlighted area. .

The horizontal arrow in figure 2b illustrates how the material in the purely high-temperature
phase (after cooling from temperatures well above the transition) would heat when the magnetic
field is applied for the first time. About half of the material would transform in this example.
