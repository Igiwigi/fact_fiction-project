Shere is no need to drop the terms Eusporangiate and Leptosporangiate, but I think
they should be kept as descriptive words rather than as designating systematic
Edivisions. The difference of mode of origin implied by them marks no important
"g biological feature, whereas the distinction between Simplices, Gradate, and Mixte
& rests on facts of far-reaching biological significance in the production of spores, and Zat the same time commends itself as conveying definite morphological conceptions ; it
3 is true intermediate steps may be found, especially between Gradatz and Mixtee, but
such transitions are inevitable in classifications where numerous allied genera and
8 species are involved. Prantw’s divisions of Leptosporangiate into Polyangia, Oligangia, and Monangia
do not commend themselves as either definite or useful.
