When a large specimen is placed close to the magnetometer calculations become difficult.
However, simple physical considerations show that one may still expect a relation of the

though the variation with z will be complicated. We therefore again expect a quadratic
relation between the deflexion and the displacement along any line through the origin,
_ except along the axis, when there will be no deflexion.
Since the deflecting field is proportional to P the effect becomes important with strong

magnetometer magnets, and it has already been shown that strong magnets are required
to measure very small fields; in fact, this induced field may become a sufficiently disturbing
factor to prevent the use of very strong magnetometer magnets, and so set a limit to the
ensitivity achievable.

In general, however, B, can be made negligibly small by making r small, that is, by
ccurate centring of the specimen on the axis of the magnetometer. Such accurate centring
clearly a necessity in many experiments, even apart from the effect of the induced field.
t will be remembered that the ram carrying the specimen is attached to a two-dimensional
raverse mechanism, so as to allow the necessary movement for the centring process. The
problem of how in practice to centre accurately the ram on the magnetometer axis appeared
Binitially somewhat formidable. However, an elegant solution arose in the following way.
