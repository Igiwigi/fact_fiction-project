which is obyiously the coefficient of a” in (1+2Y)*(@+Ly, i. e. in (1 +a”.

(24) If we wish to find the chance of the specific superior limit becoming equal to the
absolute superior limit, we must write 9 in the above formule equal to y, that one of the
two quantities , » which is not greater than the other, and we shall obtain

80 that, in fact, [p, », »+Z]=[p, »+L, »+1], which relation may also be obtained by
@ priori considerations.

(25) With reference to the remark made concerning the mode of obtaining the value
of [p, », 9], I proceed to show how it may be obtained directly by the integration of an
equation in differences, and by a method analogous in idea to that by which [p, », +F]
was made to depend on [j, », 9]. For as in that case we conceived an open pencil to
be closed and then reopened, 80 we may imagine one of the rays to be withdrawn and
then reinserted. In this way, observing that the effect of introducing a negative sign
into a circle of p positive and 7 negative signs consisting of y distinct groups of each is
to produce no change in the number of the groups if inserted between two negative
8igns, but to increase that number by unity if inserted between two positive 8igns, We
may infer that the probability of » becoming »+1, in consequence of such insertion, is
