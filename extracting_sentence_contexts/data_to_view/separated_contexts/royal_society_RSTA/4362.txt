Chem.,’ vol. 17, p. 1, 1895) has arrived at an entirely different conclusion,
namely, that, as regards the vapour pressure experiments, there is no decisive
evidence for the formation of a definite chemical compound ; and he further suggests
that the results are in better agreement with the view that two immiscible solid
solutions are formed. This appears to resolve itself into the formation of two alloys
instead of one, as suggested by GRAHAM. In confirmation of the arguments of Ho1rseMA against the supposed formation of
a compound having the formula Pd,H, we have also the fact, first observed by
Favre (‘Comptes Rend.,’ vol. 77, p. 649, and vol. 78, p. 1257) and
