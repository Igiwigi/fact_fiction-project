(i) Example

To illustrate the angle interpretation, I return to the Western
Eurasian data. The PCA biplot shows two roughly parallel
clines (figure 4a), a European gradient (from Sardinian to
Finnish and Chuvash), and an Asian cline from Arab popu-
lations (top right) to the Caucasus (bottom right). This is
quantified in figure 4d, where I plot the angle corresponding
to F,4(X, Saudi; Sardinian, Finnish). For most Asian popu-
lations, using two PCs (green points) gives an angle close
to zero, corresponding to a correlation coefficient between
the two clines of r> 0.9. Just adding a third PC (blue), how-
ever, shows that the clines are not, in fact, parallel, and the
correlation for most populations is low. The finding that
three PCs are necessary to explain this data can also be
seen from the spectrum of these Fy4-statistics (figure 4e),
which have high contributions from the first three PCs.
Both results indicate that adding a third PC would give a
much better description of the data, and the relationship
between within-European variation to Saudis in particular.

(f) Other projections
So far, I used equation (2.9) to interpret F-statistics on a
PCA plot, but the argument holds for any orthonormal pro-
jection in the data space. This is useful in particular for
