Warrenserc* has observed that a metal wire composed of large crystals does not
exhibit observable elastic afterworking or hysteresis, as he also found to be the case
for any wire at the temperature of liquid air. OxuBo} has worked out a theory of
elastic afterworking on the assumption that this phenomenon is due to slipping at
crystal interfaces, and for some simple experiments, the observed results agreed with
those predicted by his theory. This attempt to ascribe imperfectness of elasticity as
being caused by action at crystal interfaces is in agreement with the known fact that
individual crystals exhibit very little afterworking or damping of vibrations. One of the most interesting applications of the theory of imperfectness of elasticity
of solids is to geophysical problems. Sir G. H. Darwin} worked out the theory of
tides of an elastico-viscous spheroid in connection with his “ Theory of Tidal Friction.”
