Exsufflation exercises or ‘reverse lung packing’, in which divers exhale as much as possible and then try to squeeze out
still more breath, is one technique divers use to improve torso flexibility and guard against barotrauma from ‘the squeeze’. The
physiological effects of hydrostatic pressure demonstrate that the difference between ‘adaptation’ and ‘damage’ can be a matter
of cultural expectations, including participants’ willingness to take risks and suffer physiological consequences of performance.

6. Conclusion

Cultural effects on embodiment are not clearly distinct from biological facts, in spite of what our academic division of labour
suggests. As Krieger argues, embodiment is literal [100]. The recognition of cultural variation in embodiment should prompt
cultural anthropologists and others to address the complex, multi-directional mechanisms that link social facts, behavioural
patterns and ideational constructs in diverse cultures with human phenotypic development.
