after 100 runs on the fifty-three films is illustrated in figure 14/, and it will be seen that
there was very little tearing of the surfaces. This result stands in marked contrast to
the extensive wear observed after only twenty runs on the single film (figure 14d). An
interesting colour change was also observed in the film during the experiment with
fifty-three films on the lower surface. Viewed at normal incidence in ordinary daylight
the colour of the undeformed film was blue, but the regions over which the slider had
passed showed a definite yellow. This change in colour offers direct evidence that the
thickness of the film is reduced as a result of sliding.

A few experiments were also carried out with films on both the top and bottom
surfaces. In general the results showed that for a given number of films on the lower
surface the friction and wear throughout the experiment were independent of the
thickness of film on the upper surface. In fact the results were the same as those
obtained with no films at all on the upper slider. Since the film at the point of contact
on the upper surface is always worn away rapidly during the very first run, this
result is to be expected.

Cholesterol films

The experiments were repeated with cholesterol films, and the results obtained are
shown in figures 15 (plate 5), 16 and 17 (plate 5). It will be seen that in many ways
the behaviour was similar to that observed with “stearic acid” films. With films on
the upper surface only, a rapid rise in the friction and wear was observed during the
sliding, and the rate of this rise was dependent on the number of films present. When
the films were placed on the lower surface the friction and wear remained unchanged
