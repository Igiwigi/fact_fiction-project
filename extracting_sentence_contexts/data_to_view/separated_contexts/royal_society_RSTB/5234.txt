of prechondral ribs, developed from the intermuscular portions of the caudal sclero-
tomites. The groove separating in 4-day Larus the anterior (interventral) and posterior
(basiventral) divisions of the atlas and axis intercentra has disappeared. â€˜The same may
be stated with regard to the histological difference expressed in 4-day Larus and 8-day
Struthio. These facts suggest that both components (inter- and basi-ventral) of the atlas
and axis intercentra have undergone complete fusion. The same can be stated with
regard to 12-day Struthio. Extracervical Regions.
