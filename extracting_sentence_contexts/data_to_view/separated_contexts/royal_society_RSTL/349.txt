HuxTeR's Observations on Bees. 173

Of the Male Bee. The male bee is considerably larger than the labourers: he
is even larger than the'queen, although not s0 long when he
is in her full state with eggs: he is considerably thicker than
either, but not longer in the same proportfon : he does not
terminate at the anus in so sharp a point ; and the opening
between the two last scales of the back and belly is larger, and
more under the belly, than in the female. His proboscis is
much shorter than that of the labouring bee, which makes me
suspect he does not collect his own honey, but takes that which
is brought home by the others ; especially as we never find
the males abroad on flowers, &c. only flying about the hives
in hot weather, as if taking an airing; and when we find that
the male of the humble bee, which collects its own food, has as
long a proboscis, or tongue, as the female, I think it is from all
these facts reasonable to suppose, the male of the common bee
feeds at home. He has no sting. The males, I believe, are later in being bred than the la-
bouring bee.
