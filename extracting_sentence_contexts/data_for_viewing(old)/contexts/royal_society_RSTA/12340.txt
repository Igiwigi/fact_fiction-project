rendered turbid to a considerable distance from the coast,* so that not only the main-
land but the adjacent islands also were covered with a mantle of sedimentary matter
deposited during those periods of comparative quiet or lulls, which are shown to have
occurred in the formation of the Head. The absence of marine remains is rei
accounted for by the temporary nature of the occupation of the land by the sea
waters, as well as by the circumstance that the waters would be rendered for a time
unfit for the habitation of marine life. We shall revert to this subject again when
we have to speak of the continental Loess.

If we suppose that the Loess in these islands was deposited during and after
submergence, it follows that as the land rose, it would be removed where it was
in the way of the effluent currents, and carried with the angular rubble down to lower
levels, or to a distance. That this was the case is shown by the fact that the “head,”
which covers the beaches, consists of angular local rubble, with Loess or brick-earth
(derived from the plateaux) as a matrix and forming occasional seams and ni j
beds, The following diagram (fig. 7) will illustrate my meaning.

* On the coast of China the sea is coloured yellow to a distance of 100 miles from land by the te
Loess-mud carried down by the rivers,
