these calculations have been performed for three kinds of molecules, viz.,
rigid elastic spheres, point centres of force repelling or attracting one another
according to the inverse 7â€œ power law, and rigid elastic spheres surrounded by fields
of attractive force. The results of these calculations are given in equations (44)-(46),
(48), and (52) respectively. When the formule are thus completed, by comparison with experimental data we
may find which of these three representations of the molecules best explains the facts,
though, as all of them are somewhat artificial and ideal, it is not necessary that any
one should excel the others in all respects. We shall find, however, that the third
hypothesis (that the molecules are rigid elastic attracting spheres) is, on the whole,
much the best of the three. It is, indeed, remarkable that so simple a mechanism can
explain so much.
