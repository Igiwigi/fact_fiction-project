It is necessary
therefore to a clear view of the state of the functions of the animal body in
sleep, to determine the bonds of union between the sensitive and vital systems;

time, inseparable. That the sensitive cannot exist independently of the vital system, is evident,
on the slightest consideration ; but the dependence of the latter on the former
