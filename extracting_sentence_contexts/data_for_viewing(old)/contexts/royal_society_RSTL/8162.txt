a product of the decompoxition of it by ozone, it was possible that errors in the exact
estimation of the reaction might arise from this cireumstance, as also from the spon-
taneous decompoxsition of the peroxide of sodium, which is especially rapid in a strongly
alkaline solution. To guard against snch errors, the binoxide of sodium in the first
experiment was dissolved in water saturated with carbonic acid. Ozone, although
