Classically, it is convenient to translate the energy conditions to
restrictions imposed on p and p. To work out the energy conditions for our type of fluid, we start by noting that in the
formulation of the field equations, both the metric given by (2.1) and the bulk fluid described


by (2.8) and (2.12), appear as static with respect to the time coordinate t, because the evolution is
taken with respect to the fifth spatial coordinate Y. Using this fact, we can reinterpret our fluid
analogue as a real anisotropic fluid having the following energy momentum tensor:

Tap = (0° + pu — p°gapd45h — Pygssd4 5p, G1)

where u%, = (a(Y),0,0,0,0), A,B=1,2,3,4,5 and aw, 8 =1,2,3,4. When we combine (2.8) with (3.1),
we get the following set of relations:

PY=—p, (3.2)

p°=-p (3.3)

and po =p. (3.4)
Note that the last two relations imply that

po=—p", (35)

which means that this type of matter satisfies a cosmological constant-like equation of state. Substituting (3.2)-(3.5) in (3.1), we find that

Tap = —p8ap5%5 + pg55d4dp- (3.6)

At this point, we can start to formulate the energy conditions.
