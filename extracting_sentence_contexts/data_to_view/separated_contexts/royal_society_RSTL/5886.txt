But in those cases even where there are
10 annual rings, it is almost always possible to distinguish the typical arrangement of
the bundles of the yearling shoot in a single circle swrrounding the pith, with processes
of cellular tissxue forming medullary rays, running out between them to the rind or
bark. This circular arrangement is seen most distinctly when the stem has the inter-
nodes developed, but it is evident even when they are little elongated. The arrange-
ment of the fibro-yascular bundles in a single circle depends upon the fact, that the
leaves of Dicotyledons are supplied by a comparatively small number (3—5—T) of
fibro-vascular bundles which are developed collaterally, and in their course through the
few internodes which they traverse, remain side by side, separated by plates of cellular
tissue (medullary rays) which are interrupted at more or less distant intervals by colla-
teral anastomoses of the bundles. The bundles supplying the leaves are formed in the
bud, and their earliest vessels constitute the sheath of the central pith ; as the leaf is
carried out from the punctum vegetationis, no new bundles are developed, but the fibro-
vascular bundles are increased in diameter by the development of wood-cells and ducts
at their peripheral surface, and in most cases at the sides, thus encroaching on the
medullary rays. In Monocotyledons it is usual to find the nascent leaf embracing with its base a
much greater 8egment of the circumference of the growing apex of the stem than in
Dicotyledons; often it extends all round, s0 as to appear like, or actually to form a tube,
as we ee even in the full-grown state of the Grasses and Sedges.
