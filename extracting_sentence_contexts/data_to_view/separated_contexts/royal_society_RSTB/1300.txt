‘The principle concerning the formation of vertebral centrum-
forming belts is the same in the recent and in the fossil Ganoids. Caturus has
remained at, or reached, a stage which in Amiéa occurs in the embryonic and early
life only. Another illustration of the repetition of early phylogenetic conditions by
embryonic phases of recent descendants, is the fact that the ‘‘ Hypocentral semi-ring ”

a both in the trunk and in the tail, shows externally typical Teleostean features ; there
