A final comment pertains to the special cases (i) bz = 0 and (ii) bp = —/bzb4, where (E) is lost
at the (EI/P) or (EC/H) boundaries, respectively (cf. equations (4.17)). In these cases (see also
§4c), the (WP) condition (4.21) still holds, so that the Green’s function (4.23) maintains the same


qualitative characteristics as in the case of a regular material far from loss of (E). In fact, it is Ee
remarkable that, even in the case of (E) loss, the displacement remains bounded everywhere in a

constrained Cosserat solid under antiplane deformations. This finding is in marked contrast with 3
the classical elasticity situation, where the loss of (E) implies also loss of (WP) (i.e. the classical : a
acoustic tensor is no longer positive definite) and hence the Green’s function can only be defined ig
in the sense of distributions (cf. equation (5.1). : a

In the following, the Green’s function will be used as a perturbing agent to examine the time- : 2
harmonic mechanical properties of a series of Cosserat materials with extreme orthotropy. To {2

characterize this orthotropy, it is expedient to introduce the dimensionless parameters
