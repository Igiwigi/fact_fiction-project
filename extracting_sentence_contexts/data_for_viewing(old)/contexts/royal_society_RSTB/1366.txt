keeping a few alive beyond the second week. The operation is more serious than
removal of a hemisphere, owing partly to hemorrhage, and partly to the frequency of
suppuration. I have only attempted to remove one lobe, viz, that on the right
side.

The severity of the symptoms has varied greatly. In some animals the symptoms
have been exceedingly slight, the cut showing little abnormality a few hours after the
operation ; in one case in which the lobe was completely removed no differences of
motion or sensation could be detected on either side. It was more usual, however,
to find some of the characteristic cerebellar symptoms. Rotation fits after the
operation, or from irritation of the wound, were frequently seen ; for the first few days
there was unsteadiness of gait, which undoubtedly appeared more related to the right
side (side of lesion) than the left ; it could, in fact, usually be made out that there
was distinct weakness of the right side. There is undoubted dulling of sensation
on the right side, especially in the hind limb; this phenomenon had early
attracted my attention, and still earlier that of Dr. RussExt, working on other animals
in the same laboratory. The weakening of sensation and motor power appears
centred in the hind limb, and as previously stated I have not noticed wrist drop as in
the case of hemisphere cats. The right hind limb is often placed obliquely under the
body, and it is very easy to push the animal over on its right side ; the animal
ascends stairs with the left feet first, the right hind limb dragging, and, in running,
instinctively seeks support on the right side by keeping close to the wall. In other
cases I have noted unsteadiness and jerkiness of the right limbs. In one example
the animal tended to fall to the left side; when running or performing any act, such
as scratching, it appeared jerked over on to this side. We were not able to detect
