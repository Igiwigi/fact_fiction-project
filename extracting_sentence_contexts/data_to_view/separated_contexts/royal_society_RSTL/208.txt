In two instances of weak
infants, the temperature, one hour after birth, was found not
to exceed 96, which is two degrees below the standard heat
of man in a state of health ; but their respiration was till lan-
guid, and the next day the heat of the axilla had risen in one
to 98.5, and in the other to gg.* To conclude, as in each hypothesis examined, difficulties
are found to exist from facts or the results of experiments of
an unbending nature, we must at present either suspend theory
altogether and search- for experimenta. crucis, or adopt that
hypothesis which is conformable to the greater number of facts. The first measure is certainly most philosophical ; but to the
latter we are naturally most inclined, and if I were questioned
which view is preferable, I should make; no. hesitation in se-
lecting Dr. BLack's, which to. me appears.
