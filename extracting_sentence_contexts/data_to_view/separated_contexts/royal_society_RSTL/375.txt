In this case there was nei-
ther a multiplication of images, nor a production of colour,
and the same result was obtained though I caused the pencil
to fall upon the interrupting stratum at the same angle at
which it was incident when the images were multiplied and
coloured. Hence, it is obvious, that if the colours were
produced by a fissure, they ought still to have appeared even
when the fissure was bounded by parallel plates of spar. In the specimen which is shown in Fig. 7, we are presented
with several curious facts relative to the interrupting plane. This specimen is intersected by three interrupting strata afhd,
ebcg, (xy, the two first being equidistant from AB, and all of
them having the same position relative to the axis of the
rhomboid. The thickness of the interrupting strata is dis-
tinctly seen_ at af and eb, and is nearly ,-- dth of an-inch,
bounded by two distinct parallel lines.
