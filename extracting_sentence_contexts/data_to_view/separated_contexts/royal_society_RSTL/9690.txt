Tf the viscosity of the planet be small, or if oceanic tidal friction be the principal
cause of change, both eccentricities are diminishing ; but if the viscosity be large,
both are increasing. In any case the rate of change must be excessively slow. As we
have no means of knowing whether the eccentricities are increasing or diminishing
this larger eccentricity of the orbit of Phobos cannot be a fact of much importance
either for or against the present views. But it must be admitted that i is a slightly
unfavourable indication. The position of the proper plane of a satellite is determined by the periodic time of
the satellite, the oblateness of the planet, and the sun's distance.
