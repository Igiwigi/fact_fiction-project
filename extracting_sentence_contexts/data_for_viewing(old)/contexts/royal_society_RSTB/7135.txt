conclusive.

Unidentified fragments of the leaves of broad-leaved plants, twigs and bark are very
common in this main part of the detritus silt. Many of the larger leaf fragments are almost
certainly those of a large-leaved Betula, but are too small to be identified with certainty.
The most abundant of all the plant remains in this layer are the leaf segments of Myrio-
phyllum, which in places occur as an almost pure deposit (figure 15 b, c, plate 2). Like
most of the organic remains they appear to have suffered considerable erosion; it is therefore
impossible to determine their original length, and hence not possible to refer them to a
species with any certainty. The segments are more slender than seems usual in M. spicatum,
and on the whole they are wider than the long segments of the aquatic form of M. verticil-
latum, so it is reasonable to suggest that they are most likely to be M. alterniflorum. This
would agree with the fact that the only Myriophyllum pollen found in this layer is that of
