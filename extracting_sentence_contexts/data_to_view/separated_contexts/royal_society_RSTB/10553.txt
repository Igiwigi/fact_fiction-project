The C-terminal domains (CTDs) are coloured in
aquamarine. ASTN2 lacks the conserved GGX,W region and PFO (representative of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins) has no directly detectable sequence homology to
the perforin-like MACPF proteins. The dashed line indicates the topological domain boundaries between the MACPF domain and CTD, to highlight the fact that
MACPF proteins generally contain a large head domain (MACPF domain and other affiliated domains) and a shorter CTD region. (b) HMM logo representation of the
two most conserved regions in the MACPF domain proteins. The MACPF/CDC signature motif features prominent glycine residues. The GGX,W motif highlights a
conserved tryptophan residue.
