Hocean (1933), using cucumber mosaic, did not find any difference in percentage
infection for feeding periods of from } hour to 24 hours on the healthy plant. This
may be due to differences in the nature of cucumber mosaic and Hy. III, but it is
also possibly accounted for by the fact that large numbers of aphids, 10 or 20 per
plant, were used so that the increase per hour would be relatively small. The shape of the curves is of interest in that the upper pair of lines are straight and
probably do not pass through zero ; the regions corresponding to the shortest times
in the lower pair are curved and might conceivably do so. In order to find out the effect of shorter feeding periods another series of experi-
ments was carried out between September, 1934, and January, 1935.
