In the above description, the notation (-) is to denote the canonical
statistical ensemble average that approximates the integral over the phase space at the limit of
large ensemble size, following the standard notion in statistical mechanics [30]. Inserting the


representation in (2.2) to (2.1), one obtains a system of dynamical moments equations, where
the first two moments satisfy

Here, the energy flux 6 expresses nonlinear energy exchanges between different fluctuation : =

general, such a representation gives rise to a non-closed system (possibly infinite-dimensional : a
ODEs) as each moment equation is coupled to higher-order moments. : =
Despite the fact that the exact equations for the statistical mean (2.3a) and the covariance : R

where u and R are the exact solutions from the statistical equations. While the mean and
covariance dynamics in (2.3a) and (2.3b) are not explicitly written in terms of E, we found that
by allowing the unresolved components in (2.3b) to depend on E, one can achieve an effective
non-Markovian closure model, especially for reduced-order model building upon the coupled
system (2.3a), (2.3b), (2.5) in leading modes [28]. For the convenience of notation in the following discussion, we consider a discrete dynamical
system induced by numerical integration of the coupled system (2.3a), (2.3b), (2.5), and a non-
Markovian equation for the energy flux 6,
