which would cause a general movement and circulation in the fluid contained in
all the portions of the soil contiguous.

On the other hand, it would seem, that a due supply of these necessary ingre-
dients, already prepared and available for their purposes, would itself be likely to
favour the development of the parts of the vegetable, and thus to canse a larger
portion of s8nch snbstances to be extracted from the earth, by the more vigorons
action excited within the secreting organs themselves.

These effects are 80 connected together, that it is difficult to pronounce which of
them deserves to rank as the first link in the series.

The only inferences, therefore, I could venture at present to deduce from the facts
which I have laid before the Society, are as follows :â€”

1st. That it is quite consistent with the general tenor of the preceding facts and
observations, to maintain with Bouss1Ncaurr, that the falling-off of a erop is de-
pendent. upon a deficiency of organic matter proper to promote the nutrition of the
plants, as well as upon a failure of its inorganic principles; not indeed that the
organic matter enters, as such, into the constitution of the vegetable, but that by its
decomposition it furnishes it with a more abundant supply of carbonic acid and am-
monia, which supply accelerates the development of its parts, and thus at once enables
it to extract more inorganic matter from the soil, and enables the soil to supply it
more copiously with the principles it requires.
