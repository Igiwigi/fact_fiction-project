Returning now to the integrals (3-40), (3-41), (4-4) to (4-6) it is seen on closer inspection
that ¢,, y, are even in A,,,* so that regarding ¢ as a complex variable the arc A(A,,) = 0is not
in fact a branch line of the integrand; this is not so of the arcs A(A,,), B(Ay.)s R(Ag,) = 0,
and in any distortion of the ¢-path of integration these arcs and any poles of the integrands
are to be avoided. The pair ¢,, y, are even in A,, only, and it is the cuts R(g,), Baa) s
R(Ap,) = 0 together with any poles which must be avoided. Further, we see that each of the
integrals in the ¢-plane, for a given complex a, is of one of the two forms

where G(¢) is even in ¢ and contains a factor vanishing exponentially on any arc of the
circle at infinity, except possibly in the neighbourhood of the negative imaginary axis
where G(¢) is O(1/|¢|). By suitable manipulation and distortion of the ¢-contour, Lapwood
