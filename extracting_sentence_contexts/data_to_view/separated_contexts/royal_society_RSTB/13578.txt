In particular: (1) developing local dialects for assor-
tative mating may lead to an exploration of the acoustic space
and hence to reaching more extreme frequencies in at least
some of the species’ subpopulations; (2,3) repertoire expansion
for mate choice or information sharing suggests that the
expanded repertoire be at least as large in size as the initial
repertoire (thus potentially pushing the frequency range
extrema). Note, however, that this hypothesis may predict

that VPL species have both lower minimum frequency and
higher maximum frequency, which we do not see in the data
presented here (in particular since VPL species also often
have vocalizations with higher minimum frequencies than
expected—table 2); (4) fitting signals to the environment for
the purpose of improved transmission may also push the reper-
toire towards an extreme (however, note that in this case,
narrowing of the repertoire is an alternative possible result of
selection for improved transmission, and would suggest that
this mechanism does not match well with the data observed
here); (5) within a population, distinctiveness for individual
recognition may also push the individual acoustic boundaries
once the core central frequencies are saturated by other conspe-
cifics. Overall, the above emphasizes the fact that although
different paths could lead to the evolution of VPL, the end
result that consists in deviating from acoustic allometry scaling
may represent a shared acoustic trait across most VPL species. While our approach mainly consisted in identifying
deviations from allometric scaling in VPL clades, several scen-
arios may provide causal explanations to our results. First, as
mentioned in our original work [4], several selective pressures
may drive allometry-cheating strategies among mammals,
regardless of VPL abilities.
