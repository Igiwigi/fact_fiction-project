and therefore we have for the complete solution

a

yY=—ar {A$(z)+By(z)+Cx(z)+D}

It
$(x)=e®, p(@)=e", x(@)=e"*,

Q;, Qz, Q, are constants determined from the equations previously given ; in fact we
easily find
40,=—=(z+8+y), 6Q=a8+ay+8y, 4Q,=—aþy

H, G, and I are constants, and the solution is

In addition to the class of invariants of Linear Differential Equations which I have
diseussed in the first part of this paper, there is also another class worth noticing,
namely, functions of the coefficients of the equation which remain unaltered when the
