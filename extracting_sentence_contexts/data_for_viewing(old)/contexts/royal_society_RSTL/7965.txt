yaries from -03 to -1 of an inch, their width being uniform throughout their entire

The Bark or Epidermis.—In a lecture delivered before the Royal Institution of Great
Britain (April 16, 1869), Mr. CarruraeRs incidentally mentions that the Calamitean
stem possessed © a thin cortical layer.” IT am not aware, however, that the true bark
has hitherto been either figured or described. 'The discovery by Mr. BuTrerworTn,
of the small stem represented in figures 9 & 10 removes much of the existing obscurity
on this subject. Of all the scores of microscopic sections of stems of which I have
either made or examined, it is remarkable that two examples alone exhibited evi-
dences of the existence of a bark, all the rest having been decorticated. The same
observation is applicable to those figured by Mr. Bixxey, in none of which is this tissue
seen. These facts show that the cohesion between the bark and the woody zone must,
have been exceedingly slight, at least in the small fragments inclosed in the ironstone
nodules from which the majority of our specimens retaining their structure have been
derived.

The entire diameter of the s8mall stem referred to is 2 of an inch. The thickness of
the woody zone at the internode is about +05. At its narrowest part the thickness of
the bark is 025, whilst it becomes very much thicker at the nodes. It has in fact been
a rather thick parenchymatous layer, in which the cells were very irregular both in size
and distribution. Some few cells of large size appear dispersed amongst others of smaller
dimensions. There is no trace of linear or other special arrangement of these cells,
either in the transvyerse (fig. 9) or yertical (fig. 10) sections. Where the bark crosses the
node, in the latter section, its surface has become somewhat disintegrated ; but though
