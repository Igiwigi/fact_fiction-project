which are, in many instances, more- than two hundred feet
distant from each other. - I am, therefore, inclined to believe,
that, as the preceding facts seem to! indicate, the matter,
which composes the new bark, acquires an organisation cal-
culated to transmit the true sap towards the roots, as that fluid
progressively descends from the leaves in the spring ; but
whether the matter, which enters into the composition of the
new bark, be derived from the bark-or the alburnum, in the
ordinary course of the growth of the tree, it will be extremely
difficult to ascertain.

It is, however, no difficult task to prove, that the bark does
not, in all cases, spring from the alburnum; for many cases
may be adduced in which it is always generated previously to
the existence of the alburnum beneath it : but none; I believe,
