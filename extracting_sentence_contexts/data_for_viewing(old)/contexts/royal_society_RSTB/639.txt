42 DR. F. W. MOTT ON HEMISECTION OF

CiaupE Brernarp* and Ostroumorr,t by experiments on animals, showed the exist-
ence of vaso-motor fibres in these roots, and GAsKELL{ showed that these fine fibres
existed in the anterior roots of the thoracic region in the Dog, and to him is due the
merit of the association and correct interpretation of these two facts.

Rose Braprorp and Bayuiss§ following up the work of CLaupE Bernarp and
Ostroumorr, have shown that stimulation of certain of these roots leads to vaso-
constriction of the vessels of the limbs, and a general rise of blood-pressure. They
have proved that the vaso-motor nerves to the hind limb of the Dog pass out by the
11th, 12th, 18th dorsal, and 1st lumbar roots. By cutting the mixed nerves beyond
the ganglion the vaso-constrictor influence is removed, and vaso-dilatation ensues.
Brown-Suquarp notes this, and also the rise of temperature. I have no doubt that
this produces a hyperexcitability of the nerves, for we know that one of the best ways
of relieving pain is the application of cold, and such conditions as favour the flow of
blood back from a part which is swollen and painful.
