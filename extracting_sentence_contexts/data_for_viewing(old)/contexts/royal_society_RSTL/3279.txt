IN order to show the incompatibility of the observed laws of terrestrial mag-
netism with the supposition of the earth itself being a magnet, and at the same
time their accordance with the laws which appertain to a body whose mag-
netism is induced by electricity, it will be necessary to take a retrospective
view of the seyeral discoyeries which have been made, connected with these
subjects, since the commencement of the present century, and particularly
within the last ten or twelve years. Up to the period of the scientific travels
of M. HumsorpT, it must be admitted that all the facts with which we were
acquainted, relative to terrestrial magnetism, were a mere collection of obser-
vations and phenomena, uncertain in themselves, unconnected with each other,
and irreducible to any specific laws ; but the confidence inspired by the high
character of this distinguished traveller, his accuracy of observation, and the
perfection of his instruments, gave a new feature to the inquiry, and laid the
foundation of our present knowledge in this science.

M. Bror was the first to undertake the difficult task of reducing these results
to some. principle of calculation. Considering the earth as a magnet, he
assumed an indeterminate distance to represent the distance of its two poles ;
and then, supposing their power to vary inversely as the square of their distance
from the point on which they acted, (a law which had been already established,)
