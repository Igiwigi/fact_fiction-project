We have shown that the quality of sinistrality is the product of a gene, that this
gene is a simple recessive to its normal allelomorph which produces dextrality, and that
the phenotypic product of this allelomorphic pair is delayed for one generation, so that
segregation appears among the broods in a group and not, as in direct inheritance,
among the individuals in a brood. This definitely implies that all the snails in any
one brood should be of the same twist. If, as we believe, this simple system provides
a reasonable explanation of the primary facts of our line-breeding and crossing, then
the occurrence of single broods containing both phenotypes or of dominant broods in
recessive lines is anomalous and implies either a breakdown in the system or the presence
of other factors that modify its expression. There are three main groups of occurrences which are thus apparently anomalous,
and owing to the extra attention which has been paid to them they figure in the pedigree
tables of the line-breeding with disproportionate frequency :—

(1) E broods, mainly (and genetically) sinistral with a varying proportion of dextrals,
are quite common ;

(2) F broods, mainly dextral with a few sinistrals, are much less frequent ;

(3) we have had a number of dextral broods (“ dextral break-throughs *’) leading to
pure or heterozygous dextral lines which have arisen in pure recessive groups,
sometimes after two or three generations of self-fertilising sinistrals. We attempt to show below that F broods (p. 120) and dextral break-throughs (p. 116)
represent an actual breakdown in the system, i.e. they are the produce of new
mutation which under our conditions occurs rather commonly.
