THE SKULL AND LARYNGEAL CARTILAGES OF PERAMELES. 467

only be considered as the articulare of Meckel’s cartilage. By methods of comparison
the same conclusion is reached, that is to say, the malleus is the modified articulare
of the rod of cartilage known as Meckel’s cartilage. This theory rests upon con-
siderable evidence, whieh is clearly emphasised by many writers, and especially by
Retcuert, Kinestey, and Gaupp. The proofs put forward in support of this
hypothesis are based upon the examination of the morphological relation of the
embryonic stages of Mammals compared with the conditions observed in Reptiles.
The continuity of the malleus with the Meckelian cartilage is one of the most
important facts in the chain of reasoning. The malleus is merely the specialised
articular surface of the Meckelian cartilage, just as the articulare is the articulating
surface in the lower jaw of an embryonic reptile, as figured by Gaurp in an embryo
Lacerta agilis (21, fig. 7). The Perameles material examined bears this out to the
full. There is no indication whatever that the conditions differ from those of all
other mammals examined.

The manubrium of the malleus in the specimens of Perameles examined is a
definite part of the malleus. Chondrification of the manubrium takes place later
than that of the malleus, but the manubrium chondrifies as an extension of the
malleus, and not as a separate ‘portion which later fuses with the body of the
malleus. This condition is in accordance with that described by Mean in Sus
(31, p. 188), by Fiscuer in-Talpa europea (13, p. 501), and by Broom in his
