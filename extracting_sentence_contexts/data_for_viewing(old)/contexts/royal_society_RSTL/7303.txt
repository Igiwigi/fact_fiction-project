> here repeat them. As he justly remarks, it would appear from Professor Sans's descrip-
tion that the pedunculate condition is much more prolonged in A. Sars# than in
© A. roxaceus; the animal being only distinguishable by the persistence of its stem from
- an adult Antedon.
© Early in 1863 Professor ALLMAN communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh”
a Memoir * On a Prebrachial stage in the development of Comatula,” based on the
© observation of a single specimen which he had obtained on the coast of South Devon ;
— and he was the first to publish the yery interesting fact that the plates first formed in

Spn them, the former constituting the calyx, and the latter forming its pyramidal roof;
<the only vestige of the radials, which are afterwards to constitute the essential part of
-Zhe $keleton, being a set of five minute plates intercalated between the upper angles of
the basals. This disposition he compares with that of the plates in certain fossil
— hy which in his opinion permanently represent a condition that is transitory
our Pentacrinoid larya. His account of the tentacular apparatus, however, bears
-Syidence of the insufficient opportunities for obseryation afforded him by the possession

DWvviLLE TrowsoN's descriptions,—which are based on frequently-repeated obseryations
