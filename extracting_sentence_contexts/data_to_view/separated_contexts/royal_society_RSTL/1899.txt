In the second edition of my Es8ay on Magnetic Attractions, I have made a
similar comparison, not by assuming the place of the pole, but by computing
it from the dip and variation ; and the errors or differences in this case, though
certainly not so small, are still by no means consideraþle. In the Article © MacnemsM ” in the Encyclopedia Metropolitana, I have

made similar computations for Paris and Copenhagen, the only two places be-
sides London where obseryations are recorded for any length of time, and in
both these the agreements between the computed and obseryed variations are
$till more approximate than in London. Now it must be considered very extraordinary that such remarkable agree-
ments as these should obtain in three places, between the computed and ob-
served variations, through more than thirty degrees of change, or for a period
of 170 years, if the hypothesis of a polar revolution were not founded in fact. As8uming then, that, from whatever cause it may proceed, snch a revolution
does take place, how are we to account for those stationary, or nearly station-
ary, points of no variation to which reference has been made? The only reply to this question appears to be, that there is no determinate
pole to which all needles point, but that every place has its own particular
pole and polar reyolution, governed probably by some one general but at pre-
sent unknown canse.
