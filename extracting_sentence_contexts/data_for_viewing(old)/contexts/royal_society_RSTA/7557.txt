of magnetite they contain is very variable, but on the average it is of the order of 0-01 Â°%
and consequently their polarization is often negligible. These sediments are underlain by
a shell of an average thickness of 15 km. which is in the main granitic but which is intruded
from below in places by basic material. In the granites the magnetite content usually lies
between 0-5 and 2%, and in basic igneous rocks it may be as much as 10%. In many places
the origin of the local anomalies is thought to lie in the high relief and the variable magnetic
polarization of the igneous basement (cf. Peters 1949). Assuming the sediments to be non-
magnetic, the anomalous gradients at the surface of the earth will be linear over distances
small compared with the depth of the basement. In places where this simple scheme is
applicable, the effect of anomalies on the radial variation of the main field can be examined
and, if necessary, eliminated.

The method depends on the fact that, in the absence of current flow and of magnetic
matter at a point, certain relations exist between the horizontal and vertical gradients of
the field components, because the following equations are satisfied :

culF=0, divF=0.

It is necessary to use spherical co-ordinates and not Cartesian co-ordinates in this discussion,
since the accuracy to which the Z and H components are measured in the experiments is of
the order of the angle subtended at the geocentre by a distance on the surface of 1 km. At
a point (7,,A) the expressions for curl F and div F are as follows:
