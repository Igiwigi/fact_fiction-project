A classic example is the lac operon, which is regulated by both a repressor and an activator [20]. In eukaryotes, a single gene could be regulated by dozens of proteins. It is a remarkable fact that,
using only thermodynamic constraints of the type we have considered, a promoter can be made to
perform a variety of mathematical operations on its regulatory inputs. Specifically, the probability
of occurrence of the transcriptionally active promoter configuration can be a complicated function
of the concentration of various transcription factors [21-26]. These concentrations can themselves
change over time owing to regulation of the genes encoding the transcription factors.
