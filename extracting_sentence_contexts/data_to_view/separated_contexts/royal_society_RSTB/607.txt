In the popliteal space the temperature depends upon thermogenesis in the muscles,
and the skin being covered with hair, little thermolysis takes place there. Conse-
quently, the vaso-motor paralysis does not make itself felt owing to the comparatively
trifling quantity of blood flowing to the skin of this part. The paralysis of the
muscles causes a deficient thermogenesis, and it is this which causes the fall of tem-
perature, as proved by the fact that, with return of movement, there is a rise of
temperature to the normal. The plantar surface of the foot, however, is supplied with sweat glands and a
large supply of cutaneous blood-vessels. â€˜I'he hemisection of the cord paralyzes
the vaso-motor nerves and the sweat glands, causing increase of blood to the part
and deficient elimination of heat by cutaneous evaporation of sweat, hence an
increased surface temperature.
