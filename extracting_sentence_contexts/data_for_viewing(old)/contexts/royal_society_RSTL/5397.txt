Banded Agate. —Strong and continuous vibrations, when the rocker was very hot.

Chalcedony.—Loud and long-continued knockings on a knob of this mineral.

Glass.—Decided vibrations on the 8mooth rounded edge of the foot of a drinking-

Earthenware.—A feeble tone, which s00n ceased, was obtained on the edge of a
dinner plate.

Flint —A decided tone, though not s0 strong as that obtained from rock-erystal.

Lydian Stone, —Permanent vibrations.

Heliotrope.—A durable tone.

Teeland-spar.—A. lighter rocker than any of those hitherto described was found
