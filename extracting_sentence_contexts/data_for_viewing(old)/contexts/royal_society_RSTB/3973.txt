Sourn ArricaANn Karroo Deposits.

For the appreciation of the various groups of the mammal-like reptiles, their
environment and the associate faunas, some brief account will be necessary of the
geological formations in which the remains occur.

The Karroo deposits cover an area of about 200,000 square miles, They are
composed mainly of shales and mudstones, with numerous layers of sandstone for the
most part a few feet in thickness, but in a few instances 200 or 300 feet. Most of
the deposits have either been formed in shallow water or by wind on land. The
present facts seem to lead to the conclusion that a huge river, comparable in size
to the Nile or Mississippi, flowed south-west towards the middle of what is now
Cape Colony. Here it turned towards the east and spread over a huge plain
extending for nearly 1000 miles. During the greater part of Permian and Triassic
times this great plain was steadily sinking, and as it sank the mud brought down
by the river became deposited and retained in the basin. ‘Though, of course, the
conditions may have varied very considerably during the 3,000,000 or so years
represented by the Permian and Triassic epochs, the conditions, on the whole, were
probably not unlike those of Egypt of to-day. Away from the river there were
probably sandy deserts, but where watered by the river and its inundations there
was a rich Glossopteris flora. The shales and mudstones are probably the remains
of the inundations—frequently rearranged by local denudation and as often dried,
crumbled up, and redeposited by the wind. The sandstones are in most cases
