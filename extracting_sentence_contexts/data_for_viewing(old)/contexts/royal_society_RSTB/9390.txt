the worm were forced to adopt a straight or curved posture
to show that the locomotory bending wave indeed propagates
via proprioceptive feedback. Using NpHR/Halo-mediated
optogenetic inhibition, the authors then showed that this feed-
back is mediated by B-type cholinergic motor neurons during
forward movement.

Caenorhabditis elegans’ sinusoidal locomotion depends on
smooth contraction and relaxation of its body wall muscles.
For many years, it was thought that unlike vertebrate skeletal
muscle, which exhibits action potentials, C. elegans body wall
muscles have only graded potentials. However, in 2011
researchers reported that worm muscles do in fact have
calcium-dependent action potentials [87], and that synchroniza-
tion of action potentials depends on gap junction coupling
between muscle cells [88]. The authors used ChR2-mediated
stimulation of excitatory cholinergic and inhibitory GABAergic
motor neurons to generate specific neuromuscular inputs
during electrophysiological recordings from body wall muscles.

Many aversive stimuli, including head touch, induce a
response consisting of a brief reversal followed by a sharp turn
during which the animal forms an ‘omega’ shape. Donnelly
et al. [89] showed that a shift in the balance between ventral
and dorsal GABAergic signalling contributes to the execution
