Their system is considerably simpler than
that of Spiegelman, in that it does not contain any externally supplied enzymes. However, in
their system, only 12 bp are subject to evolution, so that the total number of possible genotypes
is bounded above by 4!? ~ 10”. In fact, the maximum amount of information that can accumulate
(ie. 24 bits) is smaller than that required to get evolution started (namely, 84 bits) [12]. Whether
or not their system should be called life is only a matter of definition.

3. Evolution as the ‘means’ of the origin of life

The above discussion ends in an alternative conception of life: life is bacteria, archaea, plants,
animals and so forth, all of which possess genes, enzymes, membranes and so forth (i.e. the
extensional definition of life).
