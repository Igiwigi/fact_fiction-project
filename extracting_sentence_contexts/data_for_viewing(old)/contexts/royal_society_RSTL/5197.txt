with a few cases only in which it was at all probable.
If any of those fibres of the posterior roots, which, after traversing the grey sub-
Q stance, enter the anterior white columns, could be proved to extend as far as the
A brain, the indications of sensation which are said to have followed irritation of these
S columns might be thas explained. It is quite certain, however, as already stated,
S that an equa] number of those fibres pursue a downward course. On the other hand,
= if the anterior columns really be, as I believe they are, one of the channels which
SD transmit downwards the influence of the will, they can perform this office only by
& first entering the grey substance, since into this all the fibres of the anterior roots
SZ may be traced. The same inference may be drawn with regard to the laterat white
=Z columns, which from their connection, through the grey substance, with the roots of
S the nerves, would appear to be both sensitive and motor.
= The fact that many fibres of each root, on entering the grey substance, not only
s extend both upwards and downwards to a considerable distance beyond their point
> of entrance, but intermingle also in the most intricate manner with those of other
= roots, may $erve to explain how impressions made at one particular 8pot are com-
S municated in different directions to distant parts of the chord, 80 as to excite a
E sImultaneous and sympathetic action in classes of muscles which otherwise would
Z appear unconnected. It is probable that the fibres which quit the grey substance
DB and return to it by the formation of loops within the white columns, may take that
S course for the purpose of stimulating particular parts of that substance, without
5 affecting those which are intermediate.
= In concluding this series of investigations, it has appeared to me, that, considering
the beauty and transparency of my preparations, the distinctness with which their
s8everal parts are preserved, and the persevering labour which has been bestowed
