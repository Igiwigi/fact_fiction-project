S872 SIR J. B. LAWES AND DR. J. H. GILBERT ON THE COMPOSITION

ammonium carbonate and very gently heated 1:52; the average amount in the eight
entire animal ashes wasâ€”determined in the not re-ignited ash 2-20, in the re-ignited
ash 0-87, and in the ash treated with ammonium carbonate 1:48. After much com-
parative sbudy of the results, the determinations after treatment with ammonium
carbonate have been adopted throughout the series of animal ash analyses. J udging,
however, from the recorded amounts of carbonates in numerous analyses of bones, and
also from the analytical results themselves, as will be seen further on, it 8eems very
probable that even the amounts 80 determined are too low. On the other hand, it
is obvious that they are higher than in the ash in the re-ignited condition as weighed
out for the determination of other constituents, and the generally high totals which
the actual analyses show, are largely due to this cause. In fact, if the determina-
tions of carbonic acid in the re-ignited ash had been entered in the Tables, not only
would the totals have ranged considerably lower, but those for the carcass and entire
animal ashes would range lower than those for the offal ashes, which is as it should be
considering that fluorine was not determined in the ashes.

Thirty-seven of the forty animal ash analyses recorded in this paper were made, chiefly
in the Rothamsted Laboratory, by Mr. RionveR, now of Charlottenburg, Berlin ; the
remaining three were made by Mr. R. WAarINGTON, Partly in the Rothamsted Labo-
ratory and partly at Charlottenburg, Mr. Riourer has conducted nearly the whole of
the several hundred ash analyses above referred to, as well as numerous investigations
of method, with a view to testing the limits of accuracy of previous work, and to attain
greater accuracy in future. Besides the points already alluded to, he has analysed
