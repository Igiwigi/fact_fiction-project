Now the area of lead azide on which unit weight was taken up (§9) was about
2-0 % 10°cm?, These measurements were very rough. Those made for the tabular
variety of lead chloride were more accurate and gave the figure 1-15 x 10° cm?. The fact that in both cases the adsorption was very rapidly accomplished, proves that
there cannot have been any slow creep of the colloid into the interior of the crystal
such as is found with iodine on charcoal. Further, it was shown by Panett that
with the exception of certain crystals, which probably were of unusual perfection,
the microscopic measurements of area agreed well with those made by his radioactive
method. On the whole, therefore, it appears probable that the dextrine on lead azide
and chloride occupies only about one-tenth of the adsorption area required by a single

layer of rings lying flat on the surface.
