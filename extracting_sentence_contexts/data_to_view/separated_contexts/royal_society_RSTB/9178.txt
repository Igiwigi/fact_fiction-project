Everything else—what I
think I know about my body, about other people, dogs,
trees, mountains and stars, is inferential. It is a reasonable
inference, corroborated first by the beliefs of my fellow
humans and then by the intersubjective methods of science. Yet consciousness itself—the central fact of existence—still
demands a rational explanation. The past two centuries of clinical and laboratory studies
have revealed an intimate relationship between the conscious
mind and the brain, but the exact nature of this relationship
remains elusive. Why is the brain associated with conscious-
ness but not the liver or the heart, as previous cultures
believed?
