The admission, therefore, into paleontological catalogues of
two genera of bilophodont Marsupialia of the bulk of Nototherium awaits the discovery
of fossils demonstrating the distinctive characters of such. Taking a retrospect of the dental characters of the genus Nototherium with reference
to a comparison with those of the genus Diprotodon, we find that the indications, few
and feeble though they seemed in the mutilated mandibles and mandibular dentition
first received *, have been s8upported and the inferences therefrom verified in a striking
and unexpected degree by the characters of the rest of the skull and of the maxillary
dentition. The firs: molar, for example, does not give, in miniature, the bilophodont character
of the other and larger molars; its crown answers rather to the outer half of the two-
ridged grinder with a rudiment of the inner half of the hinder transverse ridge or lobe.

This tooth, in fact, exemplifies the final stage of modification converting the longitudi-
nally trenchant type of the premolar in existing Carpophagous and Poephagous Marsu-
pials into the crushing character shown in the homologous tooth of the larger marsupial
Herbivores. The rest of the molar series in Nototherium differs from that in Diprotodon
by the smaller size and in the 8moother enamel ; and, perhaps, in a little stronger indi-
cation of the production of the hind part, near the inner end, of the transverse lobes,
especially of the front one. In the incisor series the generic character of Nototherium is strongly marked by the
form, structure, and nature of the front upper incisor, as before described: and in this
character we ee a nearer approach of Nototherium to Macropus, while the characters
of the front upper incisor in Diprotodon approximate that genus to Phascolomys.
