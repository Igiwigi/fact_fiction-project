Moreover, in sections through the albumen region,
no graded intensity of staining, simulating a series of precipitation effects due to the
progressive penetration of the fixative, is observable. The association of ebony
black secretion spheres only with cells containing a normal unshrunken nucleus,
fig. 9, Plate 14, and dg, fig. 10, Plate 15, and the demonstration of a series of stages in
the glands typical of rest and active secretion, even to extravasation of albumen into
the inter-glandular spaces, suggest a differential staining of the variable physical
and chemical states of the secretion during its formation. But even more important
is the fact that deeply staining albumen granules appear either in the peripheral or
the central glands according to the actual phase of secretion in these glands when
the material was fixed. PHENOMENA IN THE OVIDUCT OF THE FOWL 181

SurFace (1912) describes three stages in the albumen glands typical of the following
secretory phases :—

i. When the albumen region is just about to commence secretion, small dark-
staining nuclei are present in the epithelium, with secretory droplets varying
from large granules to those barely visible.

ii.
