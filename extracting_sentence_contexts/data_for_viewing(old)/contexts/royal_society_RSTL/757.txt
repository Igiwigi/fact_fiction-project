M. BeRzEL1vs considers the oxygen in phosphoric acid. to
be 128.17, and M. DvuLons, 124.5, the phosphorus being 100.
M. DuLons and M. BEeRrzEL1vs suppose the quantity of oxygen
in phosphorous acid to be to that in phosphoric acid as g to 5.

The motive which immediately induced me to resume the
enquiry respecting the phosphoric combinations, was M. Du-
LoxG's paper. This ingenious chemist has not only endea-
voured to establish new proportions in the known compounds
of phosphorus, but has likewise attempted to prove the
existence of two new acids of phosphorus ; and has denied
several facts which I considered as sufficiently established,

The details which I have to lay before the Society in the


Sir H. Davy*'s new experiments on phosphorus. g17

following pages, will serve to correct and fix, I: hope, with
tolerable accuracy, the proportional number or equivalent-of
phosphorus, and-at-the same time will show the truth of the
general series of proportions that I assigned to its compounds:
In a case where my conclusions differ so materially from those
of M. Brrzerivs and Dvrons, it may be supposed: that 41
