As to the muriate of soda and sulphate
of s0da, when well dried at 212*, they lose no sensible weight
by being ignited. Upon making due allowance for the moisture contained in
the two earthy muriates, according to the estimates just
mentioned, we shall find the above result altered as follows :

Muriate of soda - - 13,3

Sulphate of soda = = 2,33

Muriate of lime - 0,975

Muriate of magnesia - 4955 |
21,460

Which result closely corresponds with the saline residue
obtained by evaporation, which was 21,9 grs. It remains for me in concluding this paper, to, communicate
to the Society an interesting fact on the composition. of sea
water just discovered by Dr. WoLLasTon, and which it is no
small gratification to me to think that the present inquiry has
been the accidental means of bringing to light. As I was
beginning the chemical part of this investigation, Dr.
