cent. below the quantity employed, the difference in the weight of the nitro-product
having been. due only to the formation of a s0mewhat larger proportion of soluble gun-
cotton. It appears from these results, and estimating the proportion of loss which the
processes of conyersion and reduction may involve at about 0:5 per cent., that the par-
ticular cotton-wool operated upon contained about 0-5 per cent. of matter foreign to

Secovered cotton indicated a loss upon the original substance employed of from 4-4 to

ib the conclusion that the deficiency in weight exhibited by the products obtained from
