Tranf. I find
that the precipitates and cryſtals obtained from
ſolutions of p/atina are red; and that a ſolution of
that metal in aqua regia to perfect ſaturation is of a
dark red, though, when diluted, yellow ; in the ſame
manner that * a red liquor (as Sir Iſaac Newton
«« obſerves) in a conical glaſs, looks of a pale and

« dilute


[35]

« dilute yellow, at the bottom, where it is thin;
« and a little higher, where it is thicker, orange ;
« where it is thicker ſtill, it becomes red; and
« where it is thickeſt, the liquor is deepeſt and dark-
« eſt,” Newton's Opt. p. 160. HAVING gone through theſe experiments and
facts, which ſeem to ſhew that the merals invariably
exhibit co/ours in the order of their denfities, when
melted with glaſs, under the circumſtances above
mentioned ; and that the other preparations of the
ſame metals, for the moſt part, aſſume the ſame
colours; it ſeemed probable that the cauſe, on
which the colour of natural bodies depend, may
ſometimes be conjeQured from the chemical ana-
lyſis of ſuch ſubſtances. This I have attempted
with regard to the colour of plants. It is known from the experiments of Lemery
and others, that all earth is impregnated with tron ;
that the ferruginous matter is received into the
roots of plants in their growth, and makes part
of their ſubſtance, and is univerſally diſſeminated
through them; and that iron may be ſeparated by
a magnet from the aſhes of all vegetables [g].
