We thus evidently define a well-ordered ascending chain of groups
GrGiGiGG.G GG. (24-4)

which can only break off when G, is no longer a free group of rank jy. This can certainly
happen only if« is a limit ordinal, as the definition immediately shows; and it must happen
at the latest for « = w,, for the chain (24-4) is properly ascending, and G,,—provided the
chain can be carried thus far—is the union of $j; denumerable groups, hence itself of order
§, and can no longer be generated by §y elements. Our first aim is to show that the chain
(24-4) can in fact be continued that far, in other words, that for every denumerable limit
ordinal A the union G.=Une, cs

is still a free group of rank Np, provided all G,, with «<A are free groups of rank Xp.

G, is clearly still denumerable, being a union of denumerably m many denumerable groups.
As union of a properly ascending chain, G, can certainly not be finitely generated.t It only
remains to show that G) is free. This we show by transfinite induction, using theorem (24:1);
to this end we sharpen both the induction hypothesis and the proposition to be proved.

} The chain need not increase properly, and the union can itself belong to the chain and the family; the
conclusion is not affected.
