Genotypes with different replication mechanisms were in different clusters with no
evolutionary trajectory between the two. Empirical studies of RNA-based fitness landscapes,


biochemical model systems for the origin of life, also show that these landscapes consist
of isolated fitness peaks with many non-viable genotypes [19,20]. The fact that both RNA-
based landscapes [19,20] and these digital landscapes have similar structures suggests that the
evolutionary patterns we see in these Avida experiments may be similar to those one would
have seen in the origin of life on Earth. The presence of isolated genotype clusters in both
digital and RNA fitness landscapes further suggests that the identity of the first self-replicator
may determine lifeâ€™s future evolution, as other evolutionary trajectories are not accessible. However, if populations can evolve larger genomes, non-accessible evolutionary trajectories may
later become accessible, as mathematical results on the structure of high-dimensional fitness
landscapes suggest [44].
