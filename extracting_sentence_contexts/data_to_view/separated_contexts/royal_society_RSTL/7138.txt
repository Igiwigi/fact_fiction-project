It is moreover from this point of view that it has been found possible to assign to the
composite symbol xy, as the symbol of a compound weight, an exact interpretation in
harmony with symbolic analogies, and it is as symbols of operation that chemical symbols
have been proved to possess the properties given in the equations

TyY=yT,
a(y+11)=2y +291,
ay=a+y,

which afford an adequate basis for a symbolic method, and enable us to apply to these
symbols those algebraic processes through which symbols become an instrument of
reasoning. ,

But further, symbols of this class afford the most real and the most obyious expres
sion of the facts with which the chemist deals. That such operations as are here indi-
cated are the primary and immediate object of his study, and therefore the most essen-
tial particular to be embodied in the symbol, has been already, to a certain extent,
recognized by more than one master of the science, adverse to the atomic mode of repre-
8entation. Thus GERHARDT, in the remarkable words which I have placed as a fitting
motto to this paper, thus defines the object of a chemical formula.
