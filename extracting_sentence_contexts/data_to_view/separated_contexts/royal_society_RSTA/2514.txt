Combining
the months of the same name from different years, the means for the 12 months
January to December in order were f

1°01, 0°96, 0°95, 1°02, 1°01, 0°99, 1°00, 1°00, 0°99, 1°02, 0°95, 0°91,

giving as arithmetic mean 0°98,. The observed departure of r,/r, from unity is in the direction indicated by theory
E and is of the right order, but is in excess of the calculated difference. A close agree-
S ment could hardly be expected on account of the experimental difficulties, and there
4 is the further important fact that the potential gradient observations refer to the
forenoon a little after 10 a.m., while the ionic observations refer to about 8 p.m., and the
6 diurnal variation in the ionic charges has not been ascertained. a On examining details, however, it will be recognised that some other factor
a probably comes in. While the mean value of p for the whole 12 months is+ 52x 10~°,
© its mean value for the 6 summer months, April to September, is+ 63 x 10~*, and that
= for the 6 winter months only + 40 x 107°.
