Using these values of the constants, the calculated contraction in the length of an
X-gauge when taken from vacuum to one atmosphere amounted to 0-000,000,219 of
its length. It was estimated that the error associated with this value of the corrective
term, due to the variations of the elastic constants quoted above, was + 0-000,000,004
of the length concerned. The other correction was due to the fact that the vacuum
determinations were made at an average residual air pressure of 0-020 mm. Since
the residual pressure was the same for all vacuum determinations to within -— 0-003 mm.
a flat correction was calculated and applied to the mean values of the X-gauges. The
calculated value of the refractive index of air at a pressure of 0-020 mm. is 1-000,000,007,
so that the correction amounted to — 7 parts in 10° of the lengths of the X-gauges.
