LEy's and Vanpome's pound be really the two remaining weights of the often-men-
tioned three which Mr. Harris presented to the Committee of 1758*, we can still
either determine, with the highest degree of probability, the specific gravity of the lost
imperial standard troy pound, or know with certainty that all hope to arrive at this
knowledge is lost. It will be only requisite to ascertain with the greatest care the
specific gravities of both pounds, the one in the possession of Mr. BincLEy, and the
other in the possession of Mr. Vaxnpows. If the specific gravity of both is found the

indeed the two remaining pounds of 1758, they must have the same stamps which the standard had, of which
