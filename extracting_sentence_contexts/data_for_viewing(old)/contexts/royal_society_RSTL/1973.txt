rarity of his opportunities. It is only in the months of March, April, and
May that the richer parts of the heavens can be advantageously observed, and

then only in the complete absence of the moon, and of twilight. When to these
conditions we add those which arise from the variable and uncertain nature of
our climate, it will be seen that a number of cirenmstances by no means fre-
quently concurring, is necessary to produce a night in which it is possible
to make any great progress in a review of nebulz ; and that in fact there is
hardly any branch of astronomy which has a greater tendency to create a sensc
of hurry, of all things the most fatal to exact observation.

The observations which are here registered comprise, more or less, about
2500 nebulz and clusters of stars, which is the number of those observed by
my father ; but of the two collections, only about 2000 are common to both,
the remaining 500 of mine being new. It may serve to show the close and
rigorous nature of my father's scrutiny, when I state, that among these 500 I
can call to mind only one very conspicuous and large nebula, and only a very
few entitled to rank in his first class, or among the © bright nebulze.” By far
the greater proportion of them are objects of the last degree of faintness, only
to be seen with much attention and in good states of the atmosphere and
