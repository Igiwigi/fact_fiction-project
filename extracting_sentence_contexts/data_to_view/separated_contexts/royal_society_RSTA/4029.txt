But it is readily seen that such is an impossibility. We cannot express the double
gamma function as a sum of an infinite series of simple gamma functions of varying
arguments. It is this fact, combined with the absence ot any quasi-addition theorem for the
double gamma functions, which precludes the possibility of any collection of formule
rivalling in number and elegance those of the doubly periodic functions. 2R2
