face of a good deal of divergence of evidence it seems worth while giving an analysis
of a few experiments on aquatic and marsh plants,

It will be seen that I find movement in many of the stomata, but that I confirm
the main fact—that aquatics, as a class, do not close their stomata to the degree
observable in average land plants,

The following tables give the change in the hygroscope readings after various
“periods of withering,” that is, after the leaves had been cut from the plants and
allowed to lie on the laboratory table for the specified times. Name. Period of withering.
