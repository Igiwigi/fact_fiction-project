Journal, and that its radius increases as the load increases in a very definite manner.

Another eircumstance brought out by the theory, and remarked on both by Lord
RAvyLEIGH and the author at Montreal, but not before expected, is that the point of
nearest approach of the journal to the brass is not by any means in the line of the
load, and, what is still more contrary to common supposition, is on the off * side of
the line of load.

This circumstance, the reason for which is rendered perfectly clear by the conditions
of equilibrium, at, once accounts for a singular phenomena mentioned by Mr. Tower,
viz., that the journal having been run in one direction until the initial tendeney to
heat had entirely disappeared, on being reversed it immediately began to heat again ;
but this effect 8topped when the process had been often repeated. 'Dhe fact being
that running in one direction the brass had been worn to the journal only on the off
side for that direction, 80 that when the motion was reversed the new off side was
like a new brass.

7A. The cireumstances which determine the greatest load which a bearing will
carry with complete lubrication, 2.e., with the film of oil extending between brass and
journal throughout the entire are, are definitely shown in the theory.

The effect, of increasing the load beyond a certain small value being to cause the
brass to approach nearer to the journal at a point H which moves from A towards O as
the load increases, and when the load is such that the least separating distance c is
about half the difference of radii Â«, the angular position of H is 40* to the off side of O,
