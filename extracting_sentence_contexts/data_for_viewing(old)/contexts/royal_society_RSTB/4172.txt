oS considerable variation in their temperature and pressure indices. Dutone and Perrr
& gave 1'233 as the temperature index, while the other experimenters found that this
3 number was a mean around which the experimental values oscillated in an irregular
8 way. Itis worthy of mention at this point that we found the rate of cooling of the dry

of the term “4 is the same for water vapour as it is for air. This has an important

bearing on the interpretation of the readings of the wet kata-thermometer which
