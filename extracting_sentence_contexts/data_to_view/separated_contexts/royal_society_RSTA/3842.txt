Additionally, a linear response is observed with the stress-
strain response, and the value of the Young’s modulus obtained from linear regression of the
reconstructed stress-strain curve is 77.35 GPa. Finally, it seems that the identification procedure
exhibits high sensitivity to noisy displacements. However, this was expected due to the fact that
the noise present in the displacement maps affects both strain and acceleration fields.

(iii) Effect of measurement temporal resolution

Dynamic tensile fracturing of concrete is closely related to the nucleation and propagation
of cracks associated with unstable crack growth [66]. Additionally, dynamic tensile fracturing
increases the crack speed under dynamic loadings to about 0.20-0.30 of the Rayleigh wave
speed [67,68]. This increased crack propagation speed of one or several tensile cracks results
in a failure process that lasts only a few microseconds and also makes it difficult to obtain a
sufficient number of measurement points.
