It should be noted that such dis-
tortions are not incompatible with MB-HRL, because it is nowhere
stipulated in the MB-HRL framework that the agent’s internal
model must necessarily be accurate. At the same time, it should


also be noted that, even when the model is inaccurate, it may still be Botvinick et al. [10], again using the same parameter values. | 8 |
