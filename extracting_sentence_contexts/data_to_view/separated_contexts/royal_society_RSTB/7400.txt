Two main phases could be distinguished: (i) motion under wind stress leading to quasi-steady
states with some or all of the isotherms tilted; (ii) internal seiche motion which developed after the
wind had dropped. These observations confirm the findings of Wedderburn and his collaborators
on the Scottish Lochs (1907-15). The results from Windermere are presented, not because any
such confirmation is necessary, but in order to secure belated recognition of the fact that Wedder-
burn’s ‘temperature seiche’ is not an isolated phenomenon, but is an everyday feature of movement
in stratified lakes subject to wind action. As this movement is an important and largely unrecognized
factor in lake environment, this paper is addressed mainly to limnologists. In its latter part, results
of theoretical analyses of a detailed series of observations are presented in non-mathematical form.
