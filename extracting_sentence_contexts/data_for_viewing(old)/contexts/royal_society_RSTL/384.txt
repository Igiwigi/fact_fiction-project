But with sorbic acid the case was quite different. When
it was diluted, and agitated for a little while with carbonate
of lime, the solution, before it could be filtered, deposited the
principal part of the sorbate in the form of a discrete, gritty
powder. The liquor when filtered produced no redness in
tincture of litmus, and every thing proved that the fluid by
mere agitation over the carbonate, had been completely neu-
tralised.

The same results which ScHEELE obtained from lime were
afforded by carbonate of barytes: but with sorbic acid I pro-
duced a liquor which showed no signs of acidity. The best
test for ascertaining this fact, seemed to be infusion of brazil
wood altered by distilled vinegar; and with this it even
appeared, that the solution contained an excess of base.

Thus it appears, that malic acid never forms with carbo-
nate of lime, any other than acidulous salts; and, as SCHEELE
observes, these solutions in some days deposit the neutral salt
in crystals. But with these carbonates, the sorbic acid forms
neutral salts, which, as s00n as formed, precipitate.

SCHEELE ascertained, that malate of magnesia is a delique-
scent_salt,* and in my trials I could not obtain it in a crystal-
line form. When evaporated, it became thick, and dried
