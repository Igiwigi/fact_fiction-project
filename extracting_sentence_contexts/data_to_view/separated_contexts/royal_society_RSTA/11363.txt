Before leaving this table, it is well to point out that the field for D

Fig. 12

is considerably more extended than that of the mixed colours, as are also the fields
for green and red separately. We may conclude that the intrinsic white light in
each colour, when added together, is greater than the intrinsic white light in the
D ray. This points to the fact that the colours of pigments should not give the same
fields as the spectrum colours with which they approximately match.

15. Connection between Change of Intensity of Colour and Extent of Field. The difference in extent of field, caused by difference in illumination, was next
determined in the horizontal directions.
