The inverse tangents that present themselves in such an expression as G (a, b, «, y, 2)
are indeterminate at corners of a corner square, but never infinite, and each of them is
multiplied by an expression, which vanishes at the corner where the inverse tangent
becomes indeterminate. ‘Thus the infinity is not removed at the expense of introducing
a new indeterminacy.

The discussion has been restricted to the evaluation of 6?y/éa éy for the assumed law
of pressure, because this was the derivative which became infinite when the pressure was
assumed to be uniform over the pressed area, and discontinuous at its boundary. It is
clear that the other derivatives required to express the stress-components, for the
assumed law of pressure, could be evaluated by processes similar to those used above.
The results would not be of much interest. The fact that the stress at every point would
be determinate is in accordance with the result of § 1.4.

It is important to observe that the breadth ¢ of the border must be finite. It would
not be possible to pass to a limit by diminishing ¢ indefinitely. The only result would
be to reproduce § 2.5 (1) with its disturbing infinity.

It may be noted that in the course of the work the double integral

il} log (z + r) da’ dy’,

taken over a square, has been evaluated, and there is nothing in the processes that have
been employed to restrict their application to a square. They would apply equally
