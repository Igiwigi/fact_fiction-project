a granular substance quite like that of the male, while the whole of its chromatin is
collected into a clump close beneath the male nucleus.

Thus the two nuclei after contact, but before fusion, undergo precisely similar
changes. These changes give a clear proof of the existence of that metaplasmic
substance whose gradual increase was traced during the maturation of the oosphere
nucleus.

Scattered through this granular filling substance in both the male and female
“nuclei are to be found at this stage a number of deeply staining fine threads. With
Heidenhain’s iron-alum-hematoxylin and with gentian-violet, they stain like the
threads of the achromatic spindle, and must be considered of kinoplasmic nature
(using the word kinoplasm without any physiological connotation ; in fact, applying

it merely to threadlike cytoplasmic structures with a special attraction for gentian-

I believe these threads to be the first indication of the first segmentation spindle,
and this view seems to be supported by evidence gained from the next stage of
conjugation. Fig, 21 represents such a stage. The male nucleus is here seen to be
completely embedded in the female, but though its outline is perfectly clear, and
there seems to have been, so far, no fusion of substance, a definite wall can no longer
