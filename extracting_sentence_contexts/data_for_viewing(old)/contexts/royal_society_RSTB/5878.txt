In the American Negro Poynter and Kxrean (loc. cit.) found the anterior branches
of the Sylvia more often arranged in Y form, a statement confirmed by GeNnNa’s
observation (1924-5)* on eleven aboriginal brains from the Cameroons, but not by
Serat’s observations on Hereros.

Tf WaLpEYER, Poynter and Krrcan, and Genna, who together examined more than
50 brains, are right, this relation cannot be associated with, or at least not caused by,
the skull, as from a mechanical viewpoint a dolichocephalic frontally sloping skull would
favour the separation of the rami anteriores Sylvii ; while a frontally shorter, less sloping
skull would keep these branches together (see also AMBIALET’s figures in Plate 47).
Besides, the intrinsic value of the occurrence of both anterior branches of the Sylvia is
proved by the fact that in Europeans a single—or poorly bifurcating—tr. anterior Sylvii,
occurring in 41 per cent. on the right, is found in only 11 per cent. on the left
(CunninGHAM, loc. cit., and QUANJER, loc. cit.). Numerical relations for both hemispheres
are desirable also for Negroes and Australians.

In the Dutch a more frontal position and typically transverse location of the lunate
sulcus is less frequent with long heads than with short heads, as may be explained by the
skull. In the Negro, however (BRopMANN, loc. cit. swpra), and also as it seems in the
Egyptian and Australian, the lunate frequently extends rather far on the convexity
(to the lambdoid suture, SHELLSHEAR)}, and the same has been observed in Egyptian
Fellaheen by Exxior Smrrx (1904) and in the Madurese by Van Noort (loc. cit. infra).

Although a larger number of brains is necessary for reliable statistical figures, such
