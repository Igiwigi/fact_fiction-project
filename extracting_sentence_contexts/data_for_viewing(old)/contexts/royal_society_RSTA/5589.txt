This was explained by the agglomeration of iron atoms, that—as soon as they are formed—
cannot undergo a reaction with the formation of FeNyg sites, that are assumed to be at the
dominating origin of ORR activity in acidic electrolyte [2,11-14]. In alkaline, in principle, even
nitrogen functionalities or inorganic iron species reveal a good activity for the ORR [15-18].
Nevertheless, the different types of possible species could reveal different selectivities for water
or peroxide formation (four- versus two-electron pathways, respectively). Also a two times two-
electron transfer mechanism can occur where peroxide is formed on site A and gets released and
re-adsorbs on site B which is capable to perform peroxide reduction to water [19].

What seems obvious, namely a possible agglomeration of iron atoms above a specific surface
occupation (area loading), was often ignored when comparing MNg macrocycles or other metal
sources supported on different templates. Within the literature, weight ratios were usually kept
constant [20-24]. This can, however, lead to the fact that for a low surface area carbon the
chosen conditions could be above the maximum loading (i.e. where still no agglomeration
occurs) and therefore leads to the formation of inorganic side phases [10,25]. In this context,
it is necessary to gain further insights, when comparing different types of supports, into what
extent variations in the surface area occupation or variation in the support diameter (but for


constant occupation) affect the composition, ORR activity and selectivity. This is necessary, to
enable studying distinct morphological impacts on the ORR performance of catalysts rather than
an overlay of morphology and iron speciation.

With this motivation, this work focuses on model-type Fe-N-C catalysts that are prepared by
a sacrificial support method [26,27] using an iron porphyrin as a starting precursor and silica as
