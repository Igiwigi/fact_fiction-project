the Polydesmide, in the size and distinct form of the ganglia, but they approach also
to that of the ulide in the uniformity of distance of the ganglia from each other,
and in their great multiplicity. Their number varies mach in different species and
subgenera. In some instances, in Mecistocephalus, NEweorr (Geophili maxillares,
Gervais), there are not more than forty-six, but in Geophilus subterraneus, LEACH,
there are eighty-six, besides those of the brain; and in a new genus, Gonibregmatus,
NeweorrÂ®, there are even $0 many as one hundred and sixty. In the higher forms
of Chilopoda, as in Scolopendra, there are only twenty-three; and in Lithobius and
Seutigera fifteen, besides the brain and medulla.

In Geophilus subterraneus (fig. 11, 12.) the brain (b) exhibits a condition similar
to that of Polydesmus, in the almost entire absence of optic nerves. But it differs
in the fact that the optic ganglia (c) are slightly developed at its sides, and that these
give off a very minute filament to the single ocellus, which exists on the under side
of the head, behind the antenna. Treviranus+ has described the brain in Geophilus
longicornis, Leacn, as entirely without organs of vision; but from the existence of
an ocellus in that species also, on each side behind the antenna, he has probably over-
looked its minute nerve. The brain itself is large, as compared with the size of the
head, and the ganglia of the antennz (a) have almost completely coalesced with it.
The nerves of the antenn are also exceedingly large, and, as in Polydesmus, seem to
compensate for the imperfection of vision, by appreciating the condition and proximity
of surrounding objects by the sense of touch. Each nerve appears to have a small
gangliform enlargement of its structure in every joint, from which branches pass off
directly to the muscles. This is a condition of the antennal nerve not before met with
in the Myriapoda. The erura which pass down from the brain are long and slender,
