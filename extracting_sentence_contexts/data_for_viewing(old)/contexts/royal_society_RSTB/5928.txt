When taken out the animals were comatose. Fifteen minutes later they had re-
covered.

Similar results were obtained with many animals in an ice chest at a temperature
of 5-6° C. The observations were made both during the day and at night, there being,
of course, no light inside the ice chest. In all cases the animals reached a condition
of maximum pallor.

In view of these facts no general statement concerning the effect of low temperature
upon reptilian pigmentary effectors can be made in the present state of knowledge.


40 A. ZOOND AND J, EYRE ON STUDIES IN REPTILIAN COLOUR RESPONSE.

The melanophores in the excised skin of Anolis equestris expand in the dark at tem-
peratures below 9° C. The chameleon becomes pale in the dark at all temperatures
down to zero. The evidence for Phrynosoma blainvillei, P. cornutum, and Anolis
carolinensis has been shown to be inconclusive. It is to be regretted that the response
to low temperatures of intact individuals of Anolis equestris has not been determined.
In spite of the by no means unequivocal nature of the evidence available on this
issue, recent authors unanimously regard it as proven that cold is one of the agencies
