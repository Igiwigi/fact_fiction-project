This process of making ‘large steps’ can be continued as long as necessary.

8. Method of ‘large steps’ and the problem of initialization of fractional
derivatives

Lorenzo & Hartley [12,13] raised the question about initialization of fractional derivatives. Their
motivation was to use or recover the information about the process y(t) in the interval (0, a), if we
consider fractional derivatives of y(t) in (a,b).

It is worth noting that in the second ‘large step’ in the considered sample problem we used, in
fact, the proper initialization of the fractional derivative in the interval (1,2) based on the known
behaviour of y(f) in (0,1).

In other words, proper initialization in the interval (a,b) can be done only when we know all
values of y(t) in the preceding interval (0, a).

9. Concluding remarks

The presented extension of the matrix approach to discretization of non-integer order derivatives
and integrals of constant and distributed order allows numerical solution of differential equations
with such derivatives on non-equidistant grids.

The matrix approach proves to be a very easy, algorithmic, modular and convenient method
