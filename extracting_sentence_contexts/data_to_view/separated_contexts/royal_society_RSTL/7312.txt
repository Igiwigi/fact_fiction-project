D=—42%+3a%* +6xyz—4y*—2, and the division into kingdoms is effected by means
of the 8urface D=0; but as in this case there are only the two characters 3r and +24,
there can be only the two kingdoms D=+ and D=— having these characters 3r and
r+2 respectively, and the determination of the character of the cubic equation is thus
effected without its being necessary to proceed further, or inquire as to the form or
number of the regions determined by the surface D=0: I believe that there are only
two regions, 80 that in this case also each kingdom consists of a single region. But pro-

ceeding in the same manner, that is, with the coefficients themselvyes as auxiliars, to
case of a quartic equation, the m-space is here a 4-dimensional space, 80 that we
by an actual geometrical discussion show how the 4-space is by the discriminatrix or
hypersurface D=0 divided into kingdoms having the characters 4r, 2p +24, 45 respec-
tively. The employment therefore of the coefficients themselves as auxiliars, although
theoretically applicable to an equation of any order whatever, can in practice be applied
only to the cases for which a geometrical illustration is in fact unnecessary.

267. I will consider in a different manner the case of the quartic, chiefly as an instance
of the actual employment of a surface in the discussion of the character of an equation;
for in the case of a quintic the auxiliars are in the sequel selected in such manner that
the surface breaks up into a plane and cylinder, and the discussion is in fact almost,
independent of the surface, being conducted by means of the curve (Professor SyLvEsTER's
Bicorn) which is the intersection of the plane and cylinder. Article Nos. 268-273.—Application to the Quartic equation.
