When the septa are sufficiently far advanced to be visible from the exterior upon
rendering the larva transparent by reagents or by compression in the fresh state, they
are found to have a remarkable and definite arrangement. This arrangement is
apparent at a very early stage, and remains unchanged as far as the development can
So followed. Hence it will be convenient to describe ib from a somewhat older
Specimen (figs. 103, 104, four days). The dorsal septa (d.s.) extend backwards for
bout one-fourth the length of the body, where they are joined by the dorso-lateral
Septa (d.1.s.). From their point of union the peduncular septum (p.s.) extends back-
wards to the aboral end of the body. The ventro-lateral septa (Â».1.s.) extend
Jackwards gome distance beyond the point of union of the above-mentioned septa,
Ind then bend upwards to join the peduncular septum at the point u (fig. 104). In
Zome cages it is difficult to trace the septum up to the peduncular septum, especially
Shen the larva is fully expanded. In fact, I completely overlooked their connexion
E my earlier paper, and described the septum as terminating freely below. In some

mens this appears to be actually the case, though it is difficult to make sure of it,

But in every case the line of longitudinal muscles accompanying the septum (see p. 780)
continued up to the peduncular septum, The ventral septa (v.s.) are of nearly the
game length as the dorsal, and in some specimens appear to terminate freely below.
In most cases, however, careful examination during a half-contracted state of the larva
Shows that the lower ends of the septa bend towards one another and unite in the
Enedian ventral line. From their point of union a band of longitudinal muscles extends
Sackwards in the median line of the body. In specimens where the septa themselves
0 nob actually join, the lines of accompanying muscles bend towards one another and
