Only five storm
occurred in the month of July, all of which crossed the Orissa coast in the westward
direction. The majority of such storms either proceed almost due west toward
Gujerat and Sindh, or turn off northwards to the valley of the Ganges, doubtless owing
to the obstruction presented by the high-pressure region in Eastern Rajputana. @
the 23 above enumerated, 9 turned off towards the Ganges Valley, 2 succeeded
crossing the Aravali range near Ajmere and ultimately reached the Indus Valley,
the remainder either proceeded vid the Narbada Valley to Gujerat and Sindh, or died
out during the trans-continental passage. To the frequent passage of such storms 0
the Central Provinces and Malwa is doubtless to be attributed the fact of these
regions having a heavier and Jess variable rainfall than any other part of the interior
of the Indian Peninsula. In October, the highest pressure is over Rajputana and Malwa, and the lowest in
Arakan and Upper Burma, and in the Trans-Himalayan regions of Ladakh and Thibet,
The general appearance of the isobars is that of a system of more or less wavy loops
surrounding the high-pressure centre in Rajputana, and extending to an unknown
distance westwards over the Arabian Sea. The system of winds due to this distri-
bution of pressure must be E. or S.E. in the extreme south of the Peninsula, 8.W. in
the Indus Valley as well as in Lower Burma and Tenasserim, W. in the Punjab, N.W.
in the Ganges Valley, N, over the Bengal delta, and N.E. over the rest of the country
Except in Bengal and on the western side of the Indus Valley, this is not diss 2
to the system due to the pressure distribution at sea-level, and accordingly, we find it
is only in these parts of the country that there are any marked anomalies in the
direction of the wind observed on the plains.
