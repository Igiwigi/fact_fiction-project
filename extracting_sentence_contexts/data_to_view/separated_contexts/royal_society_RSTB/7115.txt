A proof of formulae (117-2) or (118-1) under restrictions already mentioned is
given in Appendix 2 at the end of this Part. It may be noted here that these restrictions are
® not satisfied in the case of random-space distributions. Hence for such random-space
&% distributions the above formulae would not be valid; and in fact (117-2) would have no
= significance, as p(i,j) would be statistically zero for all values of (i, 7). For a non-random
= (or patterned) field these formulae may or may not hold, depending upon the nature of
distribution of the variate over the field and the size of the gap (7,7). For fields and gaps in
® which the above formulae are valid, the quantities G,,, G,, and G,, may be regarded as
fundamental parameters in the characterization of the field in question.
