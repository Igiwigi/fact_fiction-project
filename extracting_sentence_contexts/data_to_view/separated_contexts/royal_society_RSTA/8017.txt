On the contrary, if H, or H, were true, the sample points would
be close to O in comparatively rare cases only. THE MOST EFFICIENT TESTS OF STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES. 297

In trying to choose a proper critical region, we notice at once that it is very easy to
control errors of the first kind referred to above. In fact, the chance of rejecting the
hypothesis Hy when it is true may be reduced to as low a level as we please. For if w
is any region in the sample space, which we intend to use as a critical region, the
chance, Py (w), of rejecting the hypothesis Hy when it is true, is merely the chance
determined by H, of having a sample point inside of w, and is equal either to the
sum (when the sample points do not form a continuous region) or to the integral
(when they do) of pp» (2,, v2) taken over the region w. It may be easily made = ¢,
by chosing w sufficiently small.
