the burial of large plates into the soil provides the required tension capacity.

Helical piles are not new to the offshore environment, and as discussed (as well as patented)
by Mitchell [2] they were used as the foundations for the Maplin Sands lighthouse as long ago as
1838. The lighthouse was founded on nine screw piles (eight forming an octagon plus one in the
centre). The piles each had a single helical plate, 1.2m diameter on a shaft 0.125 m in diameter,
and they were installed by manual effort to a depth of 7m below the mudline. The lighthouse
operated for over 90 years until 1931, but the foundation was eventually undermined by scour,
and the structure collapsed in 1932.

Since the pioneering work of Mitchell, screw piles have been used for a range of offshore and
onshore structures. Recently, however, they have not seen significant use offshore, and specifically
they have not been used for offshore wind turbines, in spite of the fact that their characteristics
would seem to lend themselves rather well to this application.
