may be applied here in the same sense as in Gileichenia to the two faces of the
sporangia. But whereas in the simpler Gileichenias there is a constant orientation of
the sporangium, so that the “ central” face of the sporangium is towards the centre
of the sorus, in Cyathea dealbata there is not the same constancy of orientation of the
sporangium relatively to the sorus as a whole ; this will be concluded from the median
section (fig. 82, Plate 5), in which the sporangia (S”’) and (8”) face in exactly opposite
directions. The orientation, however, shows some degree of regularity in the basal part
of the sorus. It will be remembered that in Gleichenia dichotoma the sporangia
occupying the middle of the sorus show no regularity of orientation, while in those
nearer its base it is constant, as we now see it in Cyathea.

The cells which form the oblique annulus become enlarged early, and are partly
derived from the cap-cell, partly from the lower lateral segments ; in fact, the origin
of the annulus appears to be as in the Hymenophyllacez (see Pranti, ‘ Hymeno-
phyllaceze,’ p. 40).

The appearance of a peripheral face in a young sporangium, as seen from without,
is shown in fig. 83; the complete ring surrounds an area of the wall (“Platte”),
smaller than that in Gleichenia, but comparable in position (see fig. 7 of Gleichenia).
In fig. 83 the attachment of the stalk is on the side away from the observer; the
stomium (st.) is already defined at this early stage by cells of narrow form and smaller
size; it is lateral, whereas in Gleichenia the rupture takes place in the median plane
(w, fig. 7). Fig. 84 represents a rather younger sporangium of Cyatheu, as seen from
the “central” face (compare fig. 8 of Gleichenia dichotom«). The sporangia of
Cyathea are so well known in their mature state that it seems unnecessary to pursue
