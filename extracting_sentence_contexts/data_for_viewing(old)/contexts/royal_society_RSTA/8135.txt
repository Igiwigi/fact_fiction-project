systems. Up till then, the vapour samples had been collected under approximately
atmospheric pressure, but it became apparent then that these also, like the liquid
samples, should be pumped off. The reason for this lies in the fact that, at the lowest
temperatures and highest pressures the partial pressure of the carbon monoxide (or
nitrogen) in the vapour samples approximates to the vapour pressure of carbon monoxide
(or nitrogen). The cooling effect produced by blowing off the sample will therefore
suffice to deposit solid carbon monoxide (or nitrogen) in the capillary, from which it
will but slowly evaporate.
