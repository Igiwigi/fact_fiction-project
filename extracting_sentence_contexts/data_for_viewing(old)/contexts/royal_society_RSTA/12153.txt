of course, in the first case purely surface waves, in the second a change of phase in the
act of reflexion or refraction. With this modification the celebrated interpretation 0
the imaginary expression in his formulze, by FREsNEL, becomes quite explicit, and thi
general problem of total or partial crystalline reflexion is solved for the type of mediut
virtually assumed by him, without any detailed consideration of the nature of the
elasticity. The hypothesis is implied, and may be verified, that the surface waves
penetrate into the medium to a depth either great, or else small, compared with th
thickness of the layer of transition between the media,—a point which has not always
been sufficiently noticed. ;

Reflexion at the Surfaces of Absorbing Media.

27. The fact that homogeneous light in passing through a film of metal does not
come out a mixture of various colours, or more crucially the fact that the use of }
metallic speculum in a telescope does not interfere with spectrum observations, shows
that the equation of vibration of light in a metallic medium is linear, and therefor e
that to represent the motion of the light in the metal requires simply the introductio
of an ordinary exponential coefficient of absorption. The interface being the plane of
wy, the light propagated in the absorbing medium will be represented by the rea
part of an expression of the form A exp e271 (lw + my + nz — vt), where n is now
complex with its real part negative if the axis of 2 is towards the direction
propagation. If the opacity of the medium is so slight that the light gets down som
way beyond the interfacial layer of transition without very sensible weakening
we may therefore solve the problem of reflexion by an application of the ordinar)
surface-conditions stated in a linear form, but with a complex coefficient of elasticity
