From the + helical base written in equation (2.6), it immediately follows that there are
three distinguished subsets for which conservation properties hold (together with using the +
symmetry). For example, the [+/ + +] subset of three interacting + modes (and also for [—/ — —])
is globally conservative and has been shown to lead to an inverse cascade of energy [65] (see [66]
for experimental evidence). It was shown in [67] using DNS that strong fluxes of the + species,
and separately of the - species were observed to almost cancel each other out as one approached
the smallest excited scales of the flow, allowing for a (slow) return to full isotropy at small scale.
Furthermore, when restricting the nonlinear interactions of the Navier-Stokes equations to only
one-signed helical modes, it was also shown in [68] that the helicity cascaded to the small scales
while the energy cascaded to the large scales, and in fact, in that case, regularity could be proven,
as in two space dimensions for these bi-directional constant-flux cascades [69].

There are in fact three *separate* constant fluxes in the helicity cascade [27]. To our knowledge,
this study has not been performed for MHD, and it would be of interest to do so. It might help
unravel the different results concerning cascades of magnetic helicity [70] as well as in the decay
case [71]. Indeed, as for kinetic helicity as we mentioned before, it is not the spectrum predicted by
dimensional analysis based on the magnetic helicity injection rate that occurs in DNS (although it
does so in Markovian closures of MHD [38}), but it is rather spectra that are significantly steeper.
Magnetic helicity spectra Hyy(k) ~ k~>> have been observed, and in that case the large scales play
a predominant role, with strong non-local interactions between small scales and large scales. More
investigations of these spectra must be performed (see [72] for the fluid case). Finally note that
new helical invariants have also been analysed in [73].

In the presence of helicity, with broken mirror-symmetry, the + degeneracy of the fully
isotropic case is lifted and the K*, H* fluxes can be distinguished. An inverse energy cascade, for
