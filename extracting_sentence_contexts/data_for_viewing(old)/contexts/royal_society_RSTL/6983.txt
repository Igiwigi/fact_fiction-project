The body accompanying it, and which is readily s0luble in alcohol, is obtained, by
repeated crystallization, in the form of small, light-yelow plates which detonate on
heating, and whose alcoholic s0lution gives precipitates with nitrate of silver and
bichloride of platinum. 'This compound is, in fact, no other than the diazo-amidobenzol
previously mentioned. The coincidence with this latter was 80 complete, that it appeared
to me loss of time to analyzeit. With regard to the first of the two products of decom-
poition, it is clear that its formation must be expressed by the same equation which:
illustrated the reaction with caustic potassa upon nitrate of diazobenzol, whilst the
formation of the latter (the diazo-amidobenzol) is explained by assuming that a portion
