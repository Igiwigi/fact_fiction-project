time scales and, classically, the neural mechanisms underlying timing and time
perception have been theorized to rely on pacemakers. By contrast, different com-
putational models suggest that timing is an intrinsic property of oscillating neural
networks, which are modulated by the same circadian rhythms described above.

Recent advances in molecular and cellular biology, genomics and other
‘—omics’ promote the investigation of new dynamics in the brain. Genetic poly-
morphic variations at different genomic regions are not only responsible for
stable trait changes across organisms, but also have the potential to affect gene
expression over time [7] and, hypothetically, to modulate the neuronal coding
of timing. The understanding of how genetic sequences translate into complex
phenotypes is a major challenge in current functional genomics. This difficulty
may be due to the fact that modules of genes and gene variations that co-express
[8] must respond to precise temporal dynamics in order to encode a particular
phenotype. In addition, a number of epigenetic regulators are set in time to
modulate gene expression and cell cycle and are intimately associated with the
functioning of neural processes. Indeed, the temporal relationship between, for
