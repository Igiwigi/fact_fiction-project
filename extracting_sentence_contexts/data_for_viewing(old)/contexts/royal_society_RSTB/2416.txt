peripheral side of the sporangium, so that it faces outwards from the receptacle, as is
shown in Bauer's drawings (plate 15, figs. 6-9). The orientation of the sporangia
being strictly upon the Gleicheniaceous type, it appears that the main difference
is that, while maintaining the same position of the annulus, the slit gapes towards
the peripheral face of the sporangium rather than on the central side of it. There is
no differentiation of a stomium, but the rupture occurs regularly at the distal end
(z, fig. 66). The portions of the annulus on either side of the slit straighten as they
dry and curve outwards in the usual way ; they even become reflexed, tearing away
irregularly from the rest of the wall, or carrying fragments of it outwards; in this
state the two flaps may appear like the covers of an open book; as the induration
stops short about half-way down the side, the general form of the sporangium is not
altered by the dehiscence, so as to press upon or displace neighbouring sporangia ; in
fact, no elbow-room is required, as in Gleichenia, and this is a distinct advantage in a
sorus where sporangia are numerous ; in this we may perhaps see the rationale of the
incomplete annulus. No sudden jerks of the annulus have been observed, nor would
such jerks be very efficient, since the majority of the spores lie below the flaps of the
annulus; the shedding of the spores seems to be mainly on the principle of the

pepper-box.
