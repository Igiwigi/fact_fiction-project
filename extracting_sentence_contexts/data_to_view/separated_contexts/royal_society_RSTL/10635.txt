MR. C. A. BELL ON THE SYMPATHETIC VIBRATIONS OF JETS. 413

points that seem to me to have been overlooked or not sufficiently dwelt upon in
treating of these phenomena hitherto, and point out certain analogies which may

at least serve as guides to further experiment, even if they answer no other purpose. Briefly stated, the facts to be accounted for are the following :—

An .impulse given to the fluid at a jet orifice, or to the orifice itself, gives rise to
some kind of disturbance which probably moves forward with the mean velocity of
the stream, and therefore involves always the originally disturbed particles, or those
immediately adjoining them. If the velocity were different for different disturbances,
accurate reproduction of complex sounds at a distance from the orifice would be

impossIble.

Fig. 11. The disturbance produced by an impulse in the direction of the jet, or by a sonnd

impulse, is circular and 8ymmetrical with respect to the jet axis, and retains its

symmetrical form throughout.
