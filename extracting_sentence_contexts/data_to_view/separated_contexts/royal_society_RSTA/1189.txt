oscillations are generally consistent with predictions based on models of Jupiter’s interior, a fact
that argues against their detection being a false positive. On the other hand, the relatively low
signal-to-noise ratio involved indicates the importance of conducting follow-up observations to
provide confirmation. The putative detection of Jupiter’s oscillations has fuelled speculation that it may be possible
to detect similar oscillations of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, through similar means, from
ground-based or space-based platforms.
