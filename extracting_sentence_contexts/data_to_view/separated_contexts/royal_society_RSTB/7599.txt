If, however, we equate the two types of high-level drift, there still remain
the various valley deposits to be correlated. Dr Tomlinson has five such deposits earlier
than No. 2 terrace—low-level Western Drift (e.g. the sands and gravels of Riley’s Pit,
Temple Balsall), the Kingswood gravel train, local drift terraces, low-level Eastern Drift
gravels as at Hatton station, Bearley station and Preston Bagot, and No. 4 terrace from
Little Alne south-westward. The first four she equates more or less, but places the fifth as
later; and to explain the fact that the Kingswood gravels and low-level Eastern Drift lie
on a long profile which seems to grade into No. 4 terrace lower down the River Alne (1935,
p. 458, fig. 8, Pl. XX VII, fig. 2), invokes two phases of erosion and aggradation which
happened to finish at the same height. I have in my correlation table suggested that these
two phases are really one, coinciding with the formation of No. 4 Avon terrace.
