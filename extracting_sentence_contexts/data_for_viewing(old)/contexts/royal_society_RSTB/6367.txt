the lower portions are parts of the premaxillaries. The outer fragment on the left
side probably is. On the left side of the section is seen a section across the 5th upper
incisor apparently of the A set. There is no evidence of any succeeding tooth. On
the right side the section passes behind the 5th incisor. On each side is seen a section
of one of the lower canines, showing the position of these teeth in natural occlusion.

Transverse section 6, fig. 7, Plate 1. This section is about 2 mm behind section 5,
and it is essentially similar, but here on both sides the nasal meets the septomaxillary.
On the left side the root of the 5th incisor is seen, but, as in the other section, there is
no evidence of a succeeding tooth germ.

Transverse section 7, fig. 8, Plate 1. This section is from 17 to 19 mm behind
section 6. Here the nasals are seen as large, thick bones. From the fact that the
surface of the nasals is grooved somewhat like the surface of the horn core of an un-

gulate apparently by blood vessels one may infer that over the nasals there was in life
a thick, horny plate or plates. In the closely allied Lycosuchus the nasals are united, and
there was probably a considerable horny boss developed on the snout. The section
passes through the posterior ends of the septomaxillaries. Below the outer sutures of
the nasals are seen on either side small bony fragments. These are possibly, but not
certainly, detached portions of the nasals. There has been a little crushing of the
specimen, and parts of the maxillae are seen to be fractured. The prevomers are well
