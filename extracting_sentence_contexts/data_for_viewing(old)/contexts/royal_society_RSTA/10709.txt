biological investigations. It seemed, therefore, desirable to enter a little more
fully into the analysis of the cases in which the criterion was positive but v
imaginary, and discover what types of frequency curves had escaped my attention.*

The key to the solution lies in the fact noted on p. 369 of the memoir, namely, that
even if the criterion be positive, there will still be a solution akin to Type I. and not
to Type IV. if « be negative. No frequency series satisfying these conditions had at
that time come under my notice, and later, when collecting data of floral variability,
my own remark as to ¢ had slipped from my memory. It is the object of this
supplement to obtain an improved criterion of type, to discuss the nature of the
curves which fill the gap observed, and to illustrate by one or two examples the
fitting of such curves to actual statistics.

(2.) The Two Criteria.

Throughout this supplement the notation of the previous memoir will be assumed
to be familiar to the reader.
