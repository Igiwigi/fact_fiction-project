The modern human pace and pattern of growth differs
from other primate species. There are several components of
modern human maturation that together define it as distinct
[45-48]. One is the length of the growth period (approx. 20
years) judged by the time body mass, stature and skeletal
development (epiphyseal fusion) are all usually completed.
But besides this, Tanner [45] drew attention to the prolongation
of time between weaning and puberty in modern humans and
to the slow pace of attainment of both stature and body mass
during this period. Human growth is also characterized by a
marked spurt of growth in weight and stature at the beginning
of adolescence and by the fact that these spurts occur earlier on
average in girls than in boys [46].

Traditionally, this overall pattern of human growth has
been considered advantageous for learning, especially for
learning the cooperative skills required for social life prior
to an individual becoming sexually mature and coming into
competition with others [45]. Equally important are the ener-
getic savings for the individual and for the mother during the
slow period of growth between weaning and puberty. Brain
growth and maintenance are costly and, it has been argued,
there is a tight inverse relationship between brain metabolism
and body growth rate from infancy until puberty [49] so that
