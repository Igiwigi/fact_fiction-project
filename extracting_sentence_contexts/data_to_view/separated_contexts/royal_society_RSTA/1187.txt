In illustration
of this two general observations may be cited. When the amplitude is large, a few
sharp ridges are formed for a limited region near the nodes, although the ridges at the
antinodes are blurred, which demonstrates the unfavourable effect of too large an
amplitude. The fact that the ridges never extend right up to the nodes shows that a
certain minimum amplitude of motion is necessary. The amplitude has been cited as the criterion, since it is open to direct observation,
but general considerations of the hydrodynamics of viscous motion would suggest
that it is the velocity of the air past the particles, possibly the acceleration, that con-
stitutes the criterion. The principles of dynamical similarity afford some information
on this point.
