Such play faces performed by the exuberant
youngsters inform the mother of the infant that everything
is under control and that it is only play. This finding shows
that play faces and laughter in chimpanzees convey a ‘false
alarm’ message highly similar to that suggested for the evol-
ution of laughter in humans. As a matter of fact, we could
hypothesize that the False Alarm Theory proposed by Rama-
chandran has its biological roots in the free physical play
during which offensive and surprising behavioural elements
are recruited to increase the surprise effect that can flow into
a burst of laughter in the end. Similarly to the False Alarm Theory, the Darwin-Hecker
hypothesis—albeit speculative—is worth mentioning because
it represents an intriguing attempt to explain humour from a
naturalistic and evolutionarily sound perspective, rather
than as a uniquely human cognitive trait. Here we argue
that this theory also applies to non-human animals.
