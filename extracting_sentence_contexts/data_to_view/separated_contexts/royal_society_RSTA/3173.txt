When this happens
all of the electrons in the atom will be strongly perturbed. In figure 4, I compare the semi-classical one-active-electron calculations of antiproton capture
and of ionization [21] to FMD calculations of the same processes [22]. As suggested by the
author, the results in [21] were multiplied by 2 to account for the fact that either of the electrons
could participate in the collision. For the capture process, there are also results from a quantum
mechanical calculation, also in the one-active-electron approximation by Tong et al. [23]. While
methods based on a classical description of the atom, such as FMD, of course do not give a fully
realistic description of the atomic structure, they have the advantage that they do include all
particles on the same footing.
