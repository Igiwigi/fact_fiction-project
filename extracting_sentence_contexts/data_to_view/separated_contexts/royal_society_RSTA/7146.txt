In consequence, a tetrameric vapour was sug-
gested, but further study by Yeddanapalli & Schubert, as reported in a private communica-
tion to Pitzer & Gutowsky (1946), has shown that the vapour is only dimeric at room
temperature. Since compounds such as Al(CH,)Br are known to exist, the additional
methane may perhaps be accounted for by the formation of Al(CH,) CH,, this subsequently
being measured as unchanged aluminium trimethyl. Possibly relevant to this point is the
fact that Yeddanapalli & Schubert themselves accidentally prepared a new organic com-
pound of aluminium boiling at 49 to 51Â° and more spontaneously inflammable than
aluminium trimethyl. The alternative suggestion that this might be an organic compound
of both aluminium and mercury does not appear to be very satisfactory in view of the fact
that the boiling-point is far below that of mercury dimethyl. Clearly, the pyrolysis of
aluminium trimethyl needs further investigation.
