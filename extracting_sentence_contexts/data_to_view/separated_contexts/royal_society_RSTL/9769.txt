These curves show that stimulation of the vagus increased the excitability of the yen-
tricle eufficiently to enable it either wholly or partially to recover for a time the normal
8equence of its beats upon those of the auricles, and also that increase of excitability
took place at the same time as the maximum increase in the force of the contractions. Tn the second place, stimulation of the vagus may cause a primary slowing of such a
character that a variable number of auricular beats are dropped out from the ventricular
curve, and then afterwards the ventricle may regain its original rhythm or even become
synchronous with every beat of the auricles (Plate 69, fig 15). Further, this slowing of the ventricle may not only be coincident with an acceleration
of the auricles, but in fact is more likely to occur when stimulation of the nerve causes
a marked anricular acceleration. This, at firs sight paradoxical, assertion follows neces-
sarily upon the arguments put forward in the first part of this paper, if it be assumed
that the vagus diminishes the excitability of the mnscle at the same time that it
depresses the strength of the contractions ; for the greater rapidity of the auricular
contractions denotes nob only quicker but also weaker impulses from the motor ganglia ;
and ib is clear that, if the impulses be weakened at the same time that the excitability
is lessened, a larger number of impulses will require to be swmmed up in order to
produce a contraction, than if the excitability only is diminished. Again, if the clamp be placed across the middle of the ventricle, and the contractions
of the base and apex of the ventricle be registered, the same diminution of excitability
can be observed.
