The interval between the rollers is adjustable, and

fuiform sheets of any desired thickness can -be obtained in this way with a perfection not to be met with
in those put upon the market by German firms. The planing machine is a steel bed resting upon four millimetre screws at the corners, it works vertically
up and down in a frame, the upper sides of which provide a sliding surface for the planing tool. The
importance of planing to a measured thickness is due to the fact that it is impossible to attach* the sheets
of wax one to another in such a manner as to secure perfect contact between them ; a small but measurable
interval always exists between the two opposed surfaces, and the sum of these intervals in a long series of
sections would give a markedly greater thickness to the model than it ought to possess. By planing
down after the addition of each sheet the model is kept to its true thickness.

* The simplest way to attach the sheets is to stick a hot needle through them, the melted wax makes a
firm connection when solid ; unfortunately, however, it intrudes by surface tension between the sheets, and
thus establishes an interval.
