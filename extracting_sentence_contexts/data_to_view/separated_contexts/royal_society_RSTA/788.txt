These points
were stressed by the writer (WASASTJERNA 1923) already in 1923; the R, values, given
in Table V, have since been used in several papers (WASASTJERNA 1923, 1932Â¢, d). These values are, however, very uncertain, which makes any further calculations
unreliable. It must be clearly realized that the calculations based on these figures do
not prove the truth of any theory, but rather only indicate that theory and facts, as

far as we can judge at present, are not conflicting. TABLE V
