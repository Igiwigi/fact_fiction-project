Po = rp (2 max.). (31)

Po = kp,

which bound the best critical regions. From this it follows that,

(a) If for a given ¢ a common best critical region exists with regard to the whole set
of alternatives, it will correspond to its envelope with regard to these alternatives,
and it will therefore be identical with a region bounded by a surface (31). Further, in this case, the region in which 4 S A» = const. will correspond to
the region in which py) = App, The test based upon the principle of likelihood
leads, in fact, to the use of best critical regions.

(b) If there is not a common best critical region, the likelihood of Hy with regard
to a particular alternative H, will equal the constant, /, of equation (32). It
follows that the surface (31) upon which the likelihood of Hy with regard to the
whole set of alternatives is constant, will be the envelope of (32) for which 4 = hk. The interpretation of this result will be seen more clearly in some of the examples
which follow.
