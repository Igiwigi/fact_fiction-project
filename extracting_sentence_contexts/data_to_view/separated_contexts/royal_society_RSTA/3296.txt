The variations in the values of Q thus found were
somewhat greater than those shown in Table V. The mean value was Q = 50,900—
considerably less than the value found in the present experiments. It thus seems
that the negative leak from lime is subject to irregular variations, and does not obey
the Wilson-Richardson law with anything like the accuracy of the leak from
platinum,

The fact that the negative leak from calcium is greater than from platinum at the
same temperature we have seen to be due to a decrease in the value of the constant Q,
that is, to a diminution of the energy required for the liberation of the corpuscles. The value of Q for lime as found in the observations tabulated above is greater than
the value for calcium, and the fact that the current is greater in the case of lime
than in the case of calcium is due to the enormously greater value of the constant A
in the former case. A theory to account for the negative leak from hot metals has been proposed by
