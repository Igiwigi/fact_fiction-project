and environmental states, E. In equation (2.1),
environmental change, dE&/dt, depends exclusively on
environmental states. In general, organisms are not
treated as the cause of any evolutionarily significant
changes in their environments, with the exception of
cases such as frequency dependent selection, habitat
selection, maternal inheritance and _ coevolution.
Instead adaptive evolutionary change is assumed to
be governed exclusively by a single ‘causal arrow’,
natural selection.

However, SET underestimates the significance of
the fact that, to stay alive, organisms must be active
as well as reactive relative to their environments.
Organisms must gain resources from their external
environments by genetically informed, or in animals,
possibly brain informed, fuel consuming, non-
random work [3]. They must perturb specific com-
ponents of their environments, often at locations
chosen by the organisms themselves, and they must
excrete detritus to their environments throughout
their lives [1]. Organisms are, therefore, compelled
to modify some natural selection pressures in their
environments by the accumulating consequences of
their activities. Lewontin captured this point by his
