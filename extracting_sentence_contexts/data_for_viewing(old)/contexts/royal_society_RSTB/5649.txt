264 SUNDER LAL HORA: ECOLOGY, BIONOMICS

tergal and sternal shields of the Psephenid larvee so overlap that a certain amount of
movement of one segment over the other is possible. Thus, when a larva is disengaged
from its mooring, it coils and rolls, reminding one of the habits of the trilobites. Several
animals have adopted this method of taking glancing blows lightly in the torrential
currents. The Bornean fish Gastromyzon is superficially not unlike the Silurian fish
Cephalasyis.

This apparent similarity in structure or habits, which animals living under similar
conditions exhibit, is popularly known as “ convergence in evolution.” But recent
work on correlation between animal habitat and structure has brought out a number of
facts which are supposed to indicate that convergent evolution may occur in animals
living under totally different conditions : and vice versa, animals living under identical
conditions exhibit divergent characters. This is a misapprehension. Convergence is
the result of “independent functional adaptation to similar ends” (WriLtEy, 1911).
I wish to direct special attention to the phrase, “ similar ends,” for it may happen that
animals living under different environments may have to respond in a similar fashion
to a common factor in the habitats, and this would lead independently to “ functional
adaptation to similar ends ”’ resulting in the convergence of characters. For example,
in the case of a strong swimming fish in stationary waters and of another fish which leads
a more or less sedentary life in rushing torrents, the habitats of the two are totally
dissimilar, yet in both cases the body is gracefully stream-lined to offer less resistance
to the current. Whether the fish moves through the water, or the water glides over
the fish, the physical principles involved in the reduction of resistance to the fluid
