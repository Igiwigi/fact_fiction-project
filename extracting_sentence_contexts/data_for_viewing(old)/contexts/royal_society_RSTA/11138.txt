different from that between dropping mercury and KI. And, at the same time, it
follows that if the potential difference between a KCl solution and mercury is zero
when the surface tension is a maximum, then, when the latter is a maximum in KI
solution, the potential difference from the solution to the electrode has a considerable
magnitude.

The result obtained by PascuEn* (following up the experiments of OstwAp?) for
chlorides and iodides, among other salts, that the E.M.F. required to produce the
maximum surface tension for a given solution is practically identical with the E.M.F.
of a cell containing the same solution and having as electrodes a similar large mercury
electrode to that used in the electrometer, and a dropping electrode of which the jet
becomes discontinuous in the surface of the solution seems, at first sight, a striking
confirmation of the Helmholtz theory of the electrometer. But, in fact, it is suffi-
cient for this result that the potential difference between mercury and the solution
when the surface tension is a maximum is the same as the potential difference
between the dropping electrode (of the Paschen type) and the solution.

A dropping electrode and a capillary electrode were connected up as in the
diagram.
