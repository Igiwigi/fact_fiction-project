related to H transport and trapping in the materials microstructure. However, the prediction and
prevention of H-induced damage requires a detailed knowledge of the boundaries conditions
and mechanisms controlling H absorption, motion and segregation in the materials and further =
the local enhancement of H concentration responsible for H-induced cracking. :3

In fact, according to their dependence on the nature of the metallic material and on the :
experimental conditions, the so-called H-induced cracking or H embrittlement (HE) phenomena DG
cover a wide range of multiform detrimental effects. Some of the associated crack initiation :
mechanisms have been identified thanks to the numerous studies conducted during the 14
past decades. They mainly concern H-induced cracking involving equilibrium conditions and ae
occurring mainly under static conditions (load, deformation, temperature, H activity, etc.). [eB
However, more complex situations are often encountered in practice were the material may : Ss
locally experience dynamic transient solicitations (plastic deformation, changes in temperature, :
microstructure and/or H activity) which may involve non-stationary boundary conditions, H
interaction with moving defects and H transient concentrations.
