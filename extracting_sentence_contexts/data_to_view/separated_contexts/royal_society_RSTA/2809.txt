Moreover, a C! convex caustic is a
caustic consisting of a closed C! curve bounding a strictly convex region inside 2. Remark 3.3.

(i) Observe that every convex caustic has a well-defined rotation number. In fact, the
dynamics tangent to it induces a circle homeomorphism from the boundary to itself; the
rotation number of the caustic corresponds to the Poincaré rotation number of this circle
homeomorphism.

(ii) One could wonder about the relation between caustics for the billiard in 2 and invariant io
curves for the corresponding billiard map Bg. One can show that a C! convex caustic in 2 :
corresponds to a homotopically non-trivial invariant curve for the billiard map; however, =
the converse is not entirely true. In fact, homotopically non-trivial invariant curves of Bg a
(which are graphs by Birkhoff’s theorem) do give rise to caustics, but these caustics need a
neither be convex nor differentiable.
