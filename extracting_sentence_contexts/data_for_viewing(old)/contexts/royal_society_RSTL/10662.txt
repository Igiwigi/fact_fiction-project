The hypothesis proposed as to the nature of the current is that C electric induction

continually-increasing induction, and breaks the tubes up, as it were, their energy

appearing finally as heat.*

Let us see how this hypothesis accounts for known facts, when aided by the two
principles just laid down.

It accounts at once for the constancy of the current at all parts of the wire in the
steady state, in 80 far as it reduces this constancy to a particular case of the law
according to which there is the game total induction over all cross sections of a tube.
If, for instance, there were more induction entering at A than at B, then more tubes
must be entering at A, and 80 there would be an increase in the number of tubes
left in the medium about B, or the field would not be steady.

Further, if we draw any closed curve embracing the wire once, we may apply the
third principle to give us the line integral of the magnetic intensity round the curve.
For this is a case where change is certainly going on in the electric field, and the
