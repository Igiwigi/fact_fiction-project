Dt is very interesting to observe, that although these alloys contain snch different
JZnantities of copper, viz. from 9:73 to 34:98, and this of a good conductor of heat, still
'So influence is exercised by it on the conductibility of the alloys, for they all give the
Sume rexults as if the square bar experimented upon were composed of pure tin.
_—— fact, which increases the importance of the bronze alloys, is the difference
:Shich they present in their conductibility when they contain an excess of copper, not
Suly with regard to the above series, but also between each alloy, all of which have a
"Snducting power of their own.
