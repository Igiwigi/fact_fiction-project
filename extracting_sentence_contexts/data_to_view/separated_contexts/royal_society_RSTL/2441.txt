Fortunately, however, two
$hips of this description came into this harbour (Cork), one from the Mediterranean,
the other from North America, which, not being sheathed with copper, had their bot-
toms literally covered with Barnacles of the three genera of Lepas, Cineras, and Otion;
and having persons employed expressly for the purpose, numbers of these were brought
alive in sea water, amongst which were many with the ova in various stages of their
progress, and some ready to hatch, which they eventually did in prodigious numbers,
80 as to enable him to add the proof of their being, like the Balani, natatory Crusta-
cea in their, first stage, but of a totally different facies and structure ; a cireumstance
which determines the propriety of the separation of the Cirripedes into two tribes,
and evinces the sagacity of Mr, MacLav in being the first to indicate that these two
tribes, the Balani and Lepades, were not s0 closely related as generally supposed *. The laryz of the Balani, described in Memoir IV. under the external appearance
of the bivalve Monoculi (Astracoda), have a pair of pedunculated eyes, more numerous
and more completely developed members, approximating to those of Cyclops, and of
the perfect Triton ; while, in the present type, or Lepades, the larva resembles some-
what that of the Cyclops, which MULE, mistaking for a perfect animal, named Amy-
mone, and which can be shown to be common to a great many of the Entomostraca ;

or the resemblance is still more striking to that of the Argulus Armiger of LaTREILLE,
which, in fact, is but an Amymone furnished with a tricuspidate shield at the
back. The genus Cineras was the first in which the laryz were obseryed to hatch, July 27,
three days after the arrival of the ship; then in Lepas anserifera, August 19; and a
few days later in Lepas dentata; in all of which there is a perfect accordance, with
very slight differences, which probably resulted from the more or less perfect develop-
ment of the larya. The very remarkable and beautiful one of Lepas anserifera may
be regarded as the perfect type to which all the others are to be referred (fig. 5.).
