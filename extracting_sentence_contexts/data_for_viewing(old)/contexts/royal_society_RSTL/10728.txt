we 8ee that the apparent specific quantity wenb on increasing for more than 12 days,
and that the total percentage of increase amounted to nearly 12. The specific
gravities, however, recorded in the table are calculated from the loss of weight observed
shortly after immersion in water, the pieces of carbon not having been boiled, and the
section as determined by dividing the loss of weight by the length agreed very well
with the section measured by the wire-gauge.

largely as the specific gravity increased ; in fact, the value of e is roughly proportional
to A®.

Beerz* has also determined the values of e for several carbon rods, used for electric
lighting, by longitudinal vibrations, and it would appear from the results obtained by
him that e+4* is also fairly constant. The mean values of Bret?” results and my
own are given in the next table.
