é  Intricacies of the kinetics of combustion of hydrogen and oxygen have proved
3 difficult enough partly to understand, but with complicated hydrocarbon molecules
5 satisfactory knowledge of the kinetics of the combustion process must prove still
-3 more troublesome to achieve. It is not intended to discuss in this paper the nature
2 of hydrocarbon combustion but only to consider some of those facts which bear on
S the particular mode of combustion that gives rise to “ knock.”
& Since “ knock” has been identified with a special process of ignition, it might be
&, expected that “knock” and ignition should exhibit close relationship. This in general
-< is so, but there are many points of difference.
—£ The type of ignition that occurs in knocking is similar to that which is produced
S by the adiabatic compression method except that in the former the gas is “ pre-
3 sensitized”; this fact explains why anti-knocks have very little effect on the ignition
© point determined by the latter method but a great effect on ‘‘ knock.” i Comparisons of behaviour on ignition with “ knock” behaviour are often made,
Q using an ignition apparatus in which the fuel is dropped into a heated vessel through
which a stream of air is passed. Such a method enhances the effects of surface on
some of the reactions while the pressure conditions are quite different.
