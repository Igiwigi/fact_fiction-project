This example illustrates the difficulty of adjusting correctly a crystal which is liable
to the growth of vicinal faces, and the impossibility of measuring accurately the
angles between the faces of the simple forms which are replaced by them, except by
tracing these changes. In sodium chlorate the vicinal faces sometimes belong to the
form {hk0}, and they make angles of from 3 to 10 minutes with the ideal cube face ; they
sometimes make re-entrant angles with each other, but the difficulties of adjustment
and measurement are increased by the fact that the vicinal faces often belong to
various forms {hkl}, and are unequally inclined to the cube faces. The same general
features hold as for alum: the vicinal forms usually become more acute as the growth
proceeds ; and they are less acute for the parts of the crystal which are most deeply
submerged. A cube face of the crystal just described, for example, gave on May 27,
1899, two images separated by 2} minutes when at a depth of about 1 inch, and two
images separated by 12 minutes near the surface of the solution.

Zine Sulphate and Magnesium Sulphate.

That the same features are also exhibited by erystals belonging to other systems
than the cubic, was proved by experiments on these two substances,
