entirely obliterated. The quantity of air expired through the different orifices must
therefore be greater at the anterior than at the posterior ones. But if one of the
larger Humble-bees (Bomb:) be placed in water, and allowed to remain completely
submerged until it has become nearly asphyxiated, the fact will then be still more
apparent. At first there will be two large bubbles expired from the anterior spi-
racles, on each side of the trunk, at each longitudinal contraction of the abdominal
segments, which corresponds to each expiration ; but as the insect becomes more
completely asphyxiated, the bubble of air will be only partially expelled from the spi-
racle, and again withdrawn at the entrance, without having escaped, at each longi-
tudinal extension of the segments, which corresponds to each inspiration, while not
a 8ingle bubble of air can be detected at the entrance of the posterior abdominal seg-
ments*, Tt is evident from this that it is chiefly through the anterior spiracles that
respiration is performed ; and it may from hence be inferred that the manner in which
the insect prepares itself for flight is exactly like that of birds under similar circum-
stances. At the moment of elevating its elytra and expanding its wings the anterior
pairs of spiracles are opened in the act of inspiration, and the air rushing into them
passes into the tracheze of the whole body, distending the air-bags and rendering the
insect of less specific gravity, s0 that when the spiracles are closed at the instant when
the insect endeavours to raise itself in the air, it is enabled to sustain a long and
powerful flight with but little expenditure of muscular power.
