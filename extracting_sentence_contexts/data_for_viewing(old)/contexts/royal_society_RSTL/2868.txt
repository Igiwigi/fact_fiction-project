to different genera; and although unable to explain how a brief intra-uterine exist-
ence and the absence of a placental connexion between the mother and foetus can
operate (if it be really effective) in arresting the development of the brain, yet it is a
coincidence which has been s0 little suspected, and is s0 interesting in various points
of view, that I believe the evidence of it will be acceptable both to the physiologist
and the naturalist. !

In order to obtain satisfactory proof of the difference in the structure of the brain
in the marsupial and placental quadruped, I dissected and compared together,
step by step, the brains of a Wombat and Beaver. These animals, as is well known,
are of nearly similar bulk, and manifest 80 many mutual affinities in their structure,
that they have been, and till are, by some naturalists, classed in the same order of
Mammalia. The Wombat is, in fact, in all its exterior characters, save the mar-
supial pouch, a Rodent; and in its internal anatomy, especially its digestive organs,
more nearly resembles the Beaver than do many of the true rodent animals. The
