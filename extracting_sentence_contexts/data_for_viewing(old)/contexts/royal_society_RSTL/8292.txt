fibrous bands in relation to the size of the cellular areole which they enclosed. We thus
learn that whilst Zyginodendron is undoubtedly an inorganic cast of the prosenchymatous
layer of the'bark of Dictyorylon, it may either represent its exterior surface, which has
impressed its contour upon the surrounding mud or sand, or it may represent its inner
surface,‚Äù to which the inorganic material has obtained access through the accidental
destruction of the inner parenchyma of the bark, Combining these observations with
the evidence derived from Mr. Niegrv's large specimen of the ligneous zone of Dicty-
ozylon Oldhamium, described on page 386, we are irresistibly brought to the conclusion
that Dictyozylon Oldhamium was an arborescent tree, which, from the comparative
abundance of its fragments preserved in the Lower Coal-measures of Lancashire, must
have formed one of the most conspicuous features of the forests of the Carboniferous age.

The bearing of the facts just recorded upon nomenclature will be considered after
describing the next subject of this memoir.

In the spring of 1871, Dr. Dawsox, of Montreal, conferred upon me the double
favour of directing my attention to the plants of Burntisland, and of introducing to me
their energetic discoyerer, G. Greys, Esq. T 800n found amongst the rich treasures
which that gentleman had brought to light a most remarkable plant, closely allied in
many points of its strueture to Dictyorylon Oldhamium. T gave a very brief and hasty
description of this plant at the Edinburgh Meeting of the British Association, assigning
