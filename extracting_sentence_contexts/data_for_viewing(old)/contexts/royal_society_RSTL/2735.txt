which are powerless while it continues to operate. Other affections of the head, certain forms of pulmonary
consumption, and many other diseases might be adduced as illustrating the same principles.


DR. PHILIP ON THE POWERS OF LIFE, 367

The latter evil can only be obviated by a careful study of the laws of sympathy in the
vital system, and particularly by ascertaining what organs are most inclined to be af-
fected by what others; for although the function of sympathy is, like other functions,
influenced by causes peculiar to the individual, it is in a great degree regulated by
principles, which more or less prevail in all*,

From the facts just referred to we easily perceive the cause of the sympathy by
which every part of each of the foregoing systems is capable of influencing every
other. Each is regulated by a leading principle, and in consequence of this, under
an influence by which the affection of any one part tends to affect all others; because
as all parts of each system both influence this principle, and are influenced by it, it
necessarily follows that all must, through it,—that is, through the central organs of
each system, which alone are the immediate organs of its leading principle, —feel the
affections of each. Such, together with the laws I am now to consider, is the source
of the function to which the term sympathy has been applied, a principle as I have
just had occasion to observe, which perhaps more extensively than any other regulates
the course of disease.

As each of the preceding systems is formed into a whole by its leading principle,
