So extremely intricate,
however, is the internal structure of the chord ; 80 numerous are the planes in which
Sthe nerve-roots enter the grey substance; and 80 various are the directions which
they pursue within it, that notwithstanding the perfect transparency of my prepara-
tions, and the sharp outline which their fibres retain, my efforts to determine the
exact relation between these roots and the white and grey columns appeared for
some time almost hopeless ; but by varying my dissections according to the exigencies
of each case of difficulty, I succeeded in arriving at several results which I believe
will be considered important. That part of the fibres composing the anterior and posterior roots of the spinal
nerves ascend longitudinally with the white columns, without entering the grey sub-
stance of the chord, and transmit to and from the brain impressions which give rise

to sensation and voluntary motion, is the opinion maintained by many eminent
physiologists and excellent observers. In support of this doctrine, Mr. GraixcerÂ®*, Mr. SoLLyF, and Dr. J. Bupcs+ have
adduced the fact of having traced these fibres in the spinal chord of the vertebrata,
A similar fact is said to have been established by Mr. Nzweorryh and Dr. Careexrer
in the invertebrata. On the other hand, the opinion that all the fibres of the Spinal
nerves enter the grey substance and belong exclusively to the spinal chord, is held
by Topp and Bowman ||, STiLING<, VoLkManN#* and others. In making the preparations for the investigation of this subject, I employed the
second method described in my former communication on the Spinal Chord4+.
