After the swap | |) is as probable as |A;) was (and still is), and | t) as |A,). Probabilities in A are
unchanged (as A is untouched) so p; and p, must have been swapped. To prove equiprobability,

we now swap records in A:
a
14) IAp) +14) Ay) —> I IAyI +1 1144). (4.5b)

Swap in A restores pre-swap | tay + |J)|A,) without touching S, so (by fact 3) the local
state of S is also restored (even though, by fact 1, it could not have been affected by the swap
of equation (4.5b)). Hence (by fact 2), all predictions about S, including probabilities, must be the
same! The probabilities of | +) and | |) (as well as of |Ay) and |A,)) are exchanged yet unchanged.
Therefore, they must be equal. Thus, in our two-state case, p; =p, = } For N envariantly
equivalent alternatives, py; =1/N for all k.

Getting rid of phases beforehand was crucial: swaps in an isolated pure state will, in general,
change the phases, and hence will change the state. For instance, |@) + i]9), after a swap
|@)(Q| + |) (@], becomes i]@) + |), ie. is orthogonal to the pre-swap state.


The crux of the proof of equal probabilities was that the swap does not change anything locally.
