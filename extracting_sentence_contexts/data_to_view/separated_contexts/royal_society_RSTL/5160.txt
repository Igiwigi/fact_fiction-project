It rather appears to me as if the lacunz and canali-
culi were little varieties left in the tissue during the depoxition of the reticular fibres, as open figures are left
out in the weaving of some artificial fabrics (but not within a cell, as HzxLz imagined), and that thus the appo-
sition of the minute apertures existing between the reticulations of the lamellz gives rise to the canaliculi.,” © At
the same time it seems not unlikely that a cell or a cell-nucleus may originally lie in the lacuna or central cavity,
and may perhaps determine the place of its formation.” HassaLL* agrees with Scawanx, while Gznpzx® and
Buvxs* appear to hold the views of Topy and Bowman. With the exception of Dr. Snanrer, the above-
named authorities may perhaps differ more in the use of terms than in matter of fact. The appearances
represented in figs. 14 and 27 would at first view seem to justify the opinion expressed by Dr. Snarrey,
but a careful examination of the tissue during its development, the unquestionable fact that in the deyelopment
from cartilage the granular cell becomes converted into a lacuna, together with the circumstance that lacunal
cells are frequently found in the Haversian canals and cancellated structure, especially in the bones of old sub-
Jects, and at times imbedded in the structure of the bone, have left no room for douht in the authors' minds that
the lacunz are formed from special nucleated cells, in the manner dexcribed in the text.
