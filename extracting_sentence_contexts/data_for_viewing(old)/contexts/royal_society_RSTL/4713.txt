< Tracing them one by one, we find that all the organs of the Salpe have their
Bomologues among the other Ascidians; the various genera passing one into the
hom by almost imperceptible gradations.
= Even the connection of the foetus with the parent by a placenta, a feature appa-

Hidee®,

Z The actual fact of a placental circulation indeed has not been observed, but it may
