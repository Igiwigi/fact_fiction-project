variant of MF-DFA called multifractal temporally weighted detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-
TW-DFA), which exploits the intuition that points closer in time are more likely to be related
than points distant in time, providing a clearer signature of long time scales present in a time
series [23]. The detailed algorithm for MF-TW-DFA can be found in ([10,24,25] and references
therein) and this is the approach we use to analyse and compare the EIE (without a seasonal
cycle) from AR5 models to that from the satellite observations. Because of the fact that there
are no a priori assumptions made regarding the physical processes in the system, this method
has also been used to explain the dynamics of Arctic sea-ice velocity fields [24], and to detect
exoplanets [25] and their atmospheres [26]. We note again that when the seasonal cycle is not
removed from the sea-ice data multifractality is inhibited and hence all the time scales longer than
annual are masked, which leads to erroneous interpretation of data or model output as obeying
an AR-1 process.

The fluctuations in a time series are quantified with respect to a smooth profile, defined as
the cumulative sum produced by time-weighting the data. These fluctuations are then combined
to construct the fluctuation function, F,(s), for each time scale, s, under examination, where q
denotes the qth moment of this function. For a given moment, the key behaviour examined is the
s-dependence of F,(s), which is characterized by a generalized Hurst exponent h(q), namely
