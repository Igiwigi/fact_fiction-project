This is not shown by the tables,
a facet probably accounted for by the great variability of the area of a large spot as
it traverses the disc. The periodic re-appearance of spots during successive rotations of the sun should
increase the intensity for periods approximating to the average rotation period. A definite periodicity must not, however, be expected, quite apart from the fact that
the rotation period itself is indefinite. The re-appearance of a phenomenon at regular
intervals of time only constitutes an approximately homogeneous periodic phenomenon
when the re-appearances are sufficiently numerous. With a life of three or four ,
rotations only, there can be little distinction between periodicities ranging from 25 to

29 days.
