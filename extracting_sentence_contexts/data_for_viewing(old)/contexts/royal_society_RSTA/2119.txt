5. Far-non-equilibrium rate-controlled constrained-equilibrium extension
of Onsager reciprocity

As shown in [74,107] in the QT framework, for states belonging to a constrained maximal entropy
manifold, such as within the RCCE approximation, any SEA evolution equation (i.e. regardless of
the particular form of the dissipative metric operator G,) entails a natural extension of Onsager’s


reciprocity theorem beyond the near-equilibrium realm. In fact, when equation (2.6) holds for
the functional derivative of the entropy, equations (4.2) and (4.3) become, in terms of the ‘non-
equilibrium constraint potentials’ x; and the ‘projected functional derivatives of the constraints’,
