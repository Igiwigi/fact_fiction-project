an umbilical
which may be considered as a part of the foetus, and an uterine which belongs
to the mother; that each of these parts has its peculiar system of arteries and
veins, and its peculiar circulation, receiving blood by its arteries and returning
it by its veins; that the circulation through these two parts of the placenta

differs in the following manner:—in the umbilical portion the arteries terminate

AND ITS CONNEXION WITH THE UTERUS. 59

in the veins by a continuity of canal, whereas in the uterine portion there are
intermediate cells, into which the arteries terminate, and from which the veins
begin *.” It is a singular fact, that these celebrated anatomists should both have as-
serted their claims to the merit of what they supposed to be the discovery of
the true structure of the human placenta, and its connexion with the uterus,
and that their controversy on this subject should have loosened those bonds of
affection which had united them together from their earlier years+. Noorrwycn, Raperts, and Harres, bad previously investigated this sub-
ject by injecting the blood-yessels of the gravid uterus: their researches how-
ever did not determine, in a satisfactory manner, that a vascular connexion
exists between the uterus and cells in the placenta. 'The opinions of the
Huxrers were generally acquiesced in at the time they were promulgated,
and their accuracy has not been called in question by any anatomist of repu-
tation in this country ſor the Jast forty years.
