If the phragmocone of the Belemnite,
and the chambered shell of the Belemnotenthis be not identical, then we know
nothing whatever, from actual observation, of the soft parts of the animal to which
the Belemnite belonged : to this point therefore I would first solicit particular atten-
tion. Phragmocone of the Belemnoteuthis.â€”As the figures in the Philosophical Transac-
tions, 1844, Plate III., &c., and in the London Geological Journal, Plate XV. XVI.,
show the phragmocone in natural connection with the muscular tunic or mantle, &c.,
I need not adduce further examples of this undisputed fact, and will therefore only
remark, that snch specimens are of rare occurrence : in most instances, the detached
chambered $hell, more or less flattened, is found imbedded in the clay, with but few,
if any, vestiges of the soft parts, as in Plate XIII. figs. 1,2,3,5.
