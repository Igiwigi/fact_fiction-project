The way in which this is produced is that the extensor
carpi radialis passes over two joints, viz.: the elbow and wrist, and the muscle is not
long enough to allow the elbow to be fully extended without its pulling on the meta-
carpal bones into which it is inserted, and thus producing extension of the wrist. In
like manner, the extension of the toes is due to the fact that their extensors, which
also pass over more than one joint, are too short to allow extension at the wrist
without their pulling on the bones into which they are inserted. Gap* relates an exactly similar experience in connection with the posterior
extremity of the Frog. He found that by drawing on the ilio-psoas muscle, he
produced not only flexion of the thigh on the abdomen, but also of the leg on the
thigh, and dorsiflexion of the foot on the leg, in fact the extremity was placed
exactly in the position of a frog about to jump.
