touches it in 10 points on the critical curve (Art. 121), and the four points correspond
to the intersection of the line with the plane in the p space, while to the ten points
correspond lines of the type mentioned in Art. 109. We learn, therefore, that an
arbitrary right line in the p space intersects ten of these lines, and that they compose
a critical surface of the tenth order. This is otherwise justified from the considera-
tion that an arbitrary quartic transformation converts a plane into a surface of the
sixteenth order; and the fact that a plane transforms into a sextic shows that a
critical surface of the tenth order has been discarded. The equation of the complementary of the Jacobian J (v7) =0 will be found in
Art, 127.

124, In like manner, taking an arbitrary curve in the q space of order M, let its
complementary be of order M’, and let both transform into a curve of order N. The
curve, being arbitrary, will not intersect the critical curve, and the 4M points in which
it cuts the quartic, transformed from an arbitrary plane in the p space, will correspond
point for point to the N points in which the transformed curve cuts the plane.
