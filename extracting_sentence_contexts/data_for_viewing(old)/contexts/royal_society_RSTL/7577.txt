Wixperiment 6.—The last experiment was repeated, with one part of unimpregnated

M@ to about three parts of water. The contractions were observed twenty-seven, forty-

Ts, which alone had imbibed water freely. 100 hours after, and three days later still,

Sed, and could not be determined.

Bxperiment e.—The experiment was repeated, using equal parts of unimpregnated
