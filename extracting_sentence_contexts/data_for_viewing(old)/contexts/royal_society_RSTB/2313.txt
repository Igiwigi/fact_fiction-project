concluded from his examination of the tissue removed that it was a new formation of
nervous tissue, and that the occipital lobes could consequently grow again after
excision. This is quite contrary to all we know of neuronic development, and a more
probable explanation in my opinion is that at the first removal the anterior parts of
the visuo-sensory areas, which in man, as I shall show later, extend forwards as far
as the splenium of the corpus callosum, were not removed, and probably were not
entirely, owing to the youth of the animal, in a mature condition of functional
activity. During the years that the animal lived after the first operation, the brain
would naturally fill up the vacant space rather than stimulate the expansion of the
skull, and the undeveloped anterior extremities of the visuo-sensory cortex would
gradually mature, the sight of the animal being apparently normal but. really
relatively defective. It may be added that these considerations are only brought
forward as a possible explanation of the facts and as an alternative to what I consider
the less probable one of Virzov.


OF THE VISUAL AREA OF THE HUMAN CEREBRAL CORTEX. 177

The immense quantity of literature which has, been published on the clinico-
pathological aspect of this subject renders it impossible to give even a brief résumé of
all the facts adduced, but fortunately a considerable amount is relatively useless,
owing to absence of precision, or only valuable as supporting statements previously
advanced. The earliest recorded case bearing on the subject was published by
Crarixov (10) in 1863. In this case permanent right hemianopsia coexisted with the
absence of a large area of cortex on the median surface of the left occipital lobe.
