predominantly X¢-like picture. It is easy to see that any factors which hinder the
development of X¢ and encourage that of X° in such a mixture will bring about a more
or less rapid change in the clinical picture from X° to X$. Any factor which induced an
aggregation of like particles would still further hasten a change over a clinical reaction;
such indeed probably accounts for the greater frequency of mutations in highly
purified virus suspensions where we know such aggregation does, in fact, take
place.

The difficulty, however, is to decide which is a case of selection from a pre-existing
mixture and which a mutation. McKinney (1935), who has paid much attention to
this problem, is strongly of the opinion that in the case of the variants arising from the
common mosaic of tobacco we are dealing with true mutations. It cannot be said that
the evidence is conclusive; in the nature of the problem it is unlikely to be so, but the
following experiments of McKinney are strongly in favour of a mutation occurring
under the conditions described.

When Nicotiana glauca is infected with common tobacco mosaic the virus becomes
systemic; when infected with yellow mosaic it does not do so. If a mixture of the two
