Definition 5.2 (Interpretability). I is an interpretation function that maps a sentence in one
language to a sentence in a second, potentially the same, language; i.e.

1:Sm > Sn, Sm € Li, Sn € Lj, Li, Lj €L- (5.2)

Definition 5.3 (Explainability). E is an explanation function iff, given a hypothesis S°”*, there
exists,

E: S07? {$%, SOP, GIF, SHI, SEP} Where R-1(S%) e Kg (5.3)

Definition 5.4 (Predictability). P is a prediction function that takes a subset of axioms and
facts, and projects them through induction or abduction onto a different set of axioms or facts; i.e.

P:S° > S° (5.4)

Definition 5.5 (Transparency). T is a transparency function that decides on the level of
interpretability, explainability and predictability that will be visible from one agent to another
agent, then implicitly or explicitly forms the language it will use to communicate this information
to the other agents; i.e.

T:{LE,P} > Ly. (5.5)

Interpretability is defined as a mapping from a sentence in one language to a sentence in
another, possibly the same, language. Explainability is defined as a sequence of sentences in
