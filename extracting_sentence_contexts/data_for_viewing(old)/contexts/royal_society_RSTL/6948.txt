in greater detail.

We have by the same method of observation examined the spectra of the components
of « Herculis. The spectrum of A is remarkable for the great strength of the groups
of lines in the green, blue, and violet ; fainter bands are visible in the yellow and orange,
also two strong bands in the red. This arrangement of the bands of absorption agrees
with the orange colour which strongly predominates in the light of this star.

B is bluish green in colour. The more refrangible portions of its spectrum are
very bright in consequence of the absence of any strong bands. The yellow and the
orange parts are crossed by several groups of lines —August 81, 1864.]

The suggestive fact that stars of these more highly refrangible colours are always
obseryed in close contiguity with much brighter stars, generally of an orange or red tint,
would afford countenance to the snppoxition that these exceptional colours are due to
some special physical conditions essentially connected with the stellar systems of which
they seem to form a part.

ARa60®* remarks, * Among the sixty or eighty thousand isolated stars, the positions
of which are to be found in the catalogues of astronomers, there are none, I think,
inseribed with any other indications in regard to colour, than white, red, and yellow.
The physical conditions which determine the emission of blue and green light appear,
then, to exist only in multiple stars.”
