The Nymphal Stages. The term nymph is an expression which is incapable of precise definition. This is
due to the fact that the only feature, in insects undergoing incomplete metamorphosis,
which serves to distinguish the larva from the nymph is the wings, which are already
present in larvee of a definite age. It will thus be evident that no hard and fast
criterion can be adopted to distinguish between larvee and nymphs. I have, there-
fore, followed Lespks, Hagen and Grassi in applying the term nymph to that
stage in which wing rudiments are sufficiently in evidence to be readily distinguishable
by the unaided eye.
