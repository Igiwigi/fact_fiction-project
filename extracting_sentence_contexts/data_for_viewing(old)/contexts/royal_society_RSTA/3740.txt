atoms removed to create vacancies. The final relaxed structures for each defect configuration are
shown in figure 1. Interestingly, we find that 7”’Pa and !'Pr defects form qualitatively identical
structures for all defect models considered. As such, the following descriptions and images for
each defect configuration apply to both.

For the substitutional defect with no vacancies, the defect ion did not move, but the nearest
neighbour carbon atoms were displaced outwards. For the single vacancy, the ion moved into
the split vacancy configuration, while for the higher-order vacancy complexes, it moved into
a position that filled the void created by the removed carbons. It is worth noting that while
the split vacancy is inversion symmetric, the higher-order vacancy complexes are not, resulting
in a permanent EDM and thus static internal electric field. While this is usually avoided for
quantum information processing applications as it makes defects susceptible to environmental
field fluctuations, it is in fact desirable for EDM experiments, as it increases the sensitivity of
EDM measurements [6].

The calculated formation and cohesive energies shed light on which configuration is most
energetically favourable to form (figure 2). Our analysis reveals that, for both 7°Pa and '4!Pr,
the substitutional model is less favourable than those containing vacancies, as it generally has
a higher formation energy despite having a marginally higher cohesive energy in certain cases.
This is in agreement with other first principles studies of defects in diamond that feature large
ions, which can introduce significant strain [20,22,36,47]. The introduction of vacancies helps to
offset this by creating additional room for the dopant atom. Among the defects with vacancies,
the double and triple vacancies are the most energetically favourable in terms of formation energy
and have comparable or larger cohesive energy values compared with the single and quadruple
