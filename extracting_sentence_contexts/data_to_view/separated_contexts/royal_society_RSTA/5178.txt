If they possess a velocity of their own i
fortuitous directions of order V, the average centrifugal electric force on an electro
due to the current will possibly be as high as 87/3a.e.vV/R, because change of sig!
of V does not change the sign of the force. This would still hardly be detectab
even if V were comparable with the velocity of radiation. But an electric force of a cognate kind has in fact already been looked for am
detected by E. H. Hatt. When the current is moving in a field of magnet
