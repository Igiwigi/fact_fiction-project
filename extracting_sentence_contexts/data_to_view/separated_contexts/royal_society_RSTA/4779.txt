The line of route partitions the reticulation into two parts, each of which may be
regarded as a partition of a unipartite. In fact, a line of route graphically
represents a pair of partitions. These partitions can be equally depicted by the essential nodes only that occur
along the line of route. It will be more convenient, for some purposes, to take the
line of route, and not merely the essential nodes, to be the graphical representation.
