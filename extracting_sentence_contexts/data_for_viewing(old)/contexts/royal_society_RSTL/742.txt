Ar. HATCHEeTT on an artificial tanning Substance. 22g

A natural process very similar to this, I much suspect takes
place in some cases where peat is formed; I say in some
-cases, because the production of tanning matter does not 8eem
to be absolutely a necessary. consequence attendant on the
formation of peat ; for in many places where the latter abounds,
'the former cannot be detected, whilst in others, it is very
abundant, and acts powerfully on animal bodies which have
accidentally been exposed to its effects.

There are many facts of this kind upon record, such as the
-account-of the bodies -of the man and woman preserved in
the-moors near the woodlands in-Derbyshire, and also of tne
woman found in the morass at Axholm, in Lincolnshire.*
Now I am much inclined to believe, that the tanning substance
which 80 much abounds in these and some other peat moors,
did not originally exist in the vegetable 8ubstances from which
the peat has been produced, but that it has been and continues
to be progressively formed (under certain favourable circeum-
stances) during the gradual carbonization and conversion of
/the vegetable matter into peat.
