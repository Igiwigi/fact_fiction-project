The circumstance of a natural structure being supplied by
artificial means is not without its parallel in the animal kingdom, and can hardly fail
to suggest the familiar example of the stomach of granivorous birds, into whick stones
are taken for the purpose of supplying the office of gastric teeth, and become essential
to the due performance of the function of that organ. Such being the nature of the apparatus, little of explanation appears to be required
with regard to the function of its several parts. The fact of the delicate nerve having a separate origin from the supra-cesophageal
ganglion, and being distributed in the form of a plexus around the sac, seems to pro-
claim this a nerve of special sense, more particularly as the lesser antennal nerye
passes 80 close to the sac in its course through the antenna (Plate IX. fig. 10. b.) that
for ordinary purposes the sac might have been most readily supplied from it. 'To
this sac, however, the antennal nerve sends off only one or two delicate twigs, and
those apparently for the purpose of supplying the tegument. or muscles immediately

surrounding the sac, and thus increasing the analogy between this and the portio
dura and mollis of the seventh pair of nerves in the higher Vertebrata. Next, the remarkable arrangement of ciliated processes immediately overlying this
plexus, with each process filled with nerve granules, exhibits an apparatus for extend-
ing the extremities of the nerves in such a manner as to render them sensitive to the
most delicate vibration of the fluid with which the sac is filled.
