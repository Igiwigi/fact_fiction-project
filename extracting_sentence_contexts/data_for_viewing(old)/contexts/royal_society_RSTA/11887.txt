cause more gas to be absorbed. In view of the more important questions awaiting
solution, we judged it unadvisable to spend any time in further determining the
nature of the gas, as we possibly might have done in a vacuum-tube by the help of
spectroscopy. We conclude, however, that the purest distilled sulphur ought to be

well (see end of paper).

remelted in vacuo before being used—but this we only began to do in 1893, after the
above facts were discovered. We should like to hazard the mere guess that the gas
is water vapour, and that it is taken up during the formation of the sulphur snow,
which is always present when sulphur vapour condenses in a retort and receiver.

General Physical Properties of Purified Sulphur.

We have not any very serious corrections to make to the observations cf previous
workers—in other words, very pure sulphur does not differ appreciably in ordinary
=characteristics from sulphur which is only moderately pure. The most obvious physical
Sdatum of a fusible solid is the melting-point, and this is, in the case of sulphur, still
rather a matter of uncertainty. The most important contribution to our knowledge
Sof this constant was supplied by B, C. Bropis (‘ Proc. Roy. Soc.,’ vol. 7, p. 24) in the
Byear 1854, The main results, as far as melting-point is concerned, are as follows :—
