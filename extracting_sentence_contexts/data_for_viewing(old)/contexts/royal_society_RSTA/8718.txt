248 MAJOR A. E. OXLEY ON THE INFLUENCE OF MOLECULAR

as to include the effects of mutual molecular influences. Such a representation of the
facts has led to the recognition of a large molecular forcive, in all crystalline media,
depending upon the nature and proximity of the molecules in any particular
crystalline grouping. The existence of this intrinsic molecular field can only be
inferred indirectly. Although the actual properties of the crystalline state depend
upon the operation of this field, yet, except in the case of substances of a
ferro-magnetic nature, there is no direct experimental evidence which discloses its
very great magnitude.

From a theoretical point of view, there seems to be no doubt that the mutual
actions of the molecules are represented by enormous internal forcives in all crystalline
media. The usual method of determining the forcive at an internal point of the
material medium is to take a cavity whose dimensions are small in comparison with
ordinary lengths (e.g., 1 em.) and yet large compared with molecular dimensions. A
