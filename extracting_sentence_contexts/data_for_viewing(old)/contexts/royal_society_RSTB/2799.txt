In more recent times, however, there would seem to be a tendency in certain
quarters to regard the Culm Measures as essentially a Lower Carboniferous series of
deposits. The opinion of Professor Hunt, already quoted, is a case in point. This
view is not, however, shared by all British Geologists. It has arisen, partly from the
fact that the older literature has to some extent been lost sight of, and partly from
the interest aroused by the recent work of Messrs. Hiypr and Fox, which placed our
knowledge of the Lower Carboniferous portion of the Culm Measures on an altogether
different footing to any which we possess of the Upper Culm Measures. We have also
in recent years gained a more intimate acquaintance with the flora of the so-called
culm, or kulm of Germany, Austria, and elsewhere on the Continent ; deposits of
Lower Carboniferous age as shown by the character of their fossil remains. The
identification by Mr. Krpsron* of certain Lower Carboniferous species of plants
believed to have been obtained from the Culm Measures, but which, as already shown,
were mostly derived from the Upper Devonian, has been quoted by Woopwarp,t
Ussuert and others in this connection.

It is one of the main objects of the present paper to show that the view that the
