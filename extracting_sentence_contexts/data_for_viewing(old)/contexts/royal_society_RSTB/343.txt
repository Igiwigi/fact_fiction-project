It will be noticed that, on the left side, the sympathetic saliva has ‘123 per cent.
less salts than the chorda saliva ; whilst, on the right side, the sympathetic saliva has
only -061 per cent. less salts than the chorda saliva, i.e., the fall in the percentage of
salts is greater on the side on which the sympathetic saliva is more rapidly secreted.
It is, however, just possible that this might have been due to a slight admixture of
chorda saliva,

The chief point, however, with which we are concerned is that, when chorda saliva
is taken as a standard, the percentage of salts in sympathetic saliva is much
higher than that which corresponds to its rate of secretion.

In view of this fact, and of the fact that stimulating the sympathetic nerve causes
a very great diminution in the amount of blood flowing through the gland, and in
consequence a very great diminution in the supply of oxygen to the secretory cells,
the possibility was suggested that if, in other ways, either the blood flow through the
gland or the oxygen in the blood were diminished, the percentage of salts in saliva
might be increased. We accordingly made some observations on these points.
