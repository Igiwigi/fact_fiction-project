(d) Oblique impact of tungsten carbide spheres on blocks of soda-lime glass

Quite frequently, the impact angle between a target surface and a projectile is not along the surface
normal to the impacted block. In such a situation, what is the nature of the damage produced
by a projectile impact? To investigate this question, 2mm diameter tungsten carbide projectiles
were propelled onto blocks of polished soda-lime glass at several angles to the surface normal at
impact velocities in the range of 125-150 ms~! and the ensuing damage was photographed at 10°
frames s~!. It was found that the main characteristics of the damage were quite similar to those
produced by normal impacts. However, there was one significant difference; for oblique impacts
the resulting Hertzian cone cracks were not oriented symmetrically to the target’s surface normal.
In fact, it was found that as the angle of impact decreased from 90° (i.e. being along the surface
normal) that between the axis of the resulting Hertzian cone fracture and the normal to the impact
surface increased in the projectile’s forward direction.

An example of an oblique impact is shown in figure 8. A 2mm diameter tungsten carbide
sphere impacts a polished block of soda-lime glass with the angle between the surface normal and
the projectile impact direction being approximately 60°. In this experiment, the test glass block
was placed between circular polarizers so as to be able to see the behaviour of the isochromatics
during the impact. The component of the impact velocity along the surface normal is 63-75 ms~!
and that along the surface of the glass block is 108-130 ms~. The latter causes the sphere to slide
along the glass surface.

The impact of the sphere on the block occurs between frames 2 and 3 and as a result a
