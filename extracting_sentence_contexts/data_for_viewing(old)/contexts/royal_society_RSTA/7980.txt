E Thus the pure hydrocarbon heptane behaves like the less pure hexane, and gives
Â© evidence of the presence of a hydroperoxide.

Caution was needed before even these results could be accepted. Their validity
rested on (1) the catalysis by molybdate of the action of the residual organic peroxides
upon hydrogen iodide ; (2) the nitrogen peroxide being removed, and the residual
nitrogen peroxide being shown less than the residual organic peroxides ; and (3)
showing that organic peroxides added to the fuel could be collected from the engine,
and estimated by the same methods.

In connection with (1) and (2), many control tests have been made, and a few
of the more important will be mentioned. (1) The fact that the molybdate solution

rapidly catalyses the decomposition of the organic peroxides after removal of NO,
would be conclusive evidence of their presence, provided it could be shown that no
other type of substances gives similar effects. Solutions of NO, in water, and of
petrol + NO, shaken in water, have been tested, using the same procedure as used
in the test, with the results that either there is no residual NOg, and both M and B
remain colourless, or that if an appreciable residue remains due to incomplete
titration, M and B colour immediately to the same faint tint. (Molybdate indeed
appears to slow down, rather than hasten, autoxidation of residual NO purposely
