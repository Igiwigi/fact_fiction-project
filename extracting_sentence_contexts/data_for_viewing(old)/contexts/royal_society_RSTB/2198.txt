of blood pressure results. It is also possible that whilst stinulation may be operative
in causing a readjustment in the speed of auricle and ventricle, the pressure may be
unaltered, so that if activity of the peripheral vagus mechanism were judged of only
by a fall of pressure resulting, the conclusion would be inevitable that there was
evidence of entire suspension of function.

In this connection an experiment may be referred to, in which no change of blood
pressure, but an acceleration of both auricles and ventricles, followed stimulation.
After aconitine, the auricle was beating 240, the ventricle 264, when stimulation of
the right vagus (coil 5) caused acceleration of both by 24, i.e., to 264 and 288
respectively. No change in blood pressure resulted, probably from the fact that the
influence of acceleration was cancelled by a less favourable sequence of ventricular
upon auricular contraction,

Though the experimental evidences adduced may not offer an explanation of all the
phenomena seen on stimulating the vagus after aconitine, it is believed that they
cover most of them, and that they imply not merely changes in the vagus peripherally,
but a variation in the reaction of the heart chamber walls at the time of stimulation.

Rapid failure of the strength of the systole of which the ventricular wall is capable,
occurs during the later stages of aconitine action, while the auricular failure is much
less marked. Though auricular regularity is largely affected, genuine incoordination
has not been witnessed after aconitine. It may, however, be present as a pathological
