2. a.). Further, by the contraction of these muscles the body may be 80 much
elongated as to carry the base of the arms to some distance above the margin of the
cell, by which the freedom of their action is considerably increased, the stomach,
being then lifted from the bottom of the cell, hanging suspended in the visceral cavity. It would appear then that the act of protrusion is effected by the combined operation
of the parietal muscles and of the alimentary canal, which in fact forms the principal
part of the substance of the animal, the parietes being purely membranous, and having
little else to do than to retain the fluid in which the viscera float. It is interesting to compare these parietal muscles with similar parts in animals of
another class. Having been frequently struck with the close analogy which the ge-
neral characters of the animal under consideration presents with those of the class
Rotifera, especially in the character of the retractor muscles, I was led to compare
the parietal muscles also with the parts which, in Zydatina senta, for example, are
usually considered and represented as the dorsal vessel with its lateral branches.
