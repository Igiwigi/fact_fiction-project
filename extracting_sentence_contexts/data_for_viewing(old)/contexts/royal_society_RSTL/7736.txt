neither to the vaporized metal of the electrodes, nor to the decomposed interior surface
of the glass, but solely to the hydrogen, constituting a new spectrum of it. This spec-
trum may be seen simultaneously with the three characteristic lines Hz, HS, Hy;
but at an increased temperature, when these lines begin to expand, it entirely dis-
appears.”

MM. PLicxER and HreroRy also determined the action of the discharge of a small in-
duction-coil through a tube enclosing hydrogen which was gradually rarefied to the
highest tenuity to be reached by a Geis8LER's exhauster ; they found that, as the exhaus-
tion proceeded, the red colour of the gas gradually faded into an © undetermined violet,”
and that He disappeared, while HP, though fainter, remained well defined.

With hydrogen gas in G1ssLER's tubes, then, the following facts are established :—

1. With a certain degree of rarefaction and temperature, we obtain three character-
istic lines, He, HB, and Hy.

II. By increasing the temperature, we expand Hy first towards both ends of the spec-
trum, then HP, He remaining almost unchanged after Hy has passed into an undeter-
mined large violet band.

TI. By increasing the tenuity, He disappears first, H3 remaining well defined, and
moreover the colour of the ignited gas changes to the eye.

IV. Under certain conditions, which are not stated in the memoir, new lines appear
