does not have any reasonable solutions. What then? An alternative way of truncation is to use a
change of variables (all operators are assumed to be time-independent)

z=y+e7R(y). (2.10)
Then y ~z — e?R(z) and simple calculations yield

zt = A(z) + €B(z) + €7{C(z) + [R, A](2)} + Oe),

where [R, A] = R'A — A’R (do not confuse this with the standard notation for the commutator of
two operators when the operators A and R are nonlinear). In fact this notation becomes the usual
one [A, R] = AR — RA in the case of linear operators A and R, since A’ = A for linear operator A.
The result can be expressed in the following form:

Proposition 2.1. Any truncated equation
yp =A(y) + BY) + PCY) + --- (2.11)

is formally equivalent to a family of equations
2 = A(z) + €B(z) + ?C(Z) +++, (2.12)

where

z=y+e?R(y) y=z—&R)+---, CZ) =C(z) + R'Z)A(Z) — ADR),
