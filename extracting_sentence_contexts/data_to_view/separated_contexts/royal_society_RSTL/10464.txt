Nor indeed could any appreciable change in the measurements be detected until the
weights used were such as to. produce further permanent elongation. When this happened, however, there was evidently an apparent alteration of
elasticity. A reference to the notes made on previous occasions then revealed the fact
that whenever the above-mentioned discrepancies had occurred a similar permanent
elongation had been produced. A fresh series of experiments was therefore begun,
which ended in the discovery of the following facts â€”

1. In the case of a wire which has suffered permanent extension the temporary
elongation which can be produced by any load becomes less as the interval between the
period of permanent extension and that of applying the load becomes greater,*

2.
