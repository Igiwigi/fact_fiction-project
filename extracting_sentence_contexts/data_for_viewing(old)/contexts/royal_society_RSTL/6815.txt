and & double points; then the line of intersection of the two planes meets the curve m
in m points, and the curve 7 in % points; or, combining in every manner the mz points
two and two together, and the n points two and two together, the line in question is to
be considered as }[m}P.$[n]* coincident lines, each meeting the curyes m, n, each curve
twice. There are besides the hk lines joining each double point of the curve m with
each double point of the curve n. This gives in all [m]P[n]Þ+hk lines; or, writing
h=3[mP+M, k=3[nÞ+N, the number is

=ImP(nP+M.4n}+N.4[mP-+MN;
which is the value of G(n?, 1?) given by the investigation.
26. G(n?, n)—We have
Gm, un)=nG(1, n)=nS(nw),
and it is in fact the same question to find G(1, m?) and to find S(m?). I assume for the
present that the value is =3$[m]P+M(m—2); and we then have

G(m, n)=n(4[mP+M(m—2)).

27. Before going further, I observe that there are certain functional conditions whict
must be satisfied by the G formulee. Thus if the curye m2 be replaced by the system 0:
the two curves m, m7, instead of M we have M+M'. Let G(m) denote any one of th
functions G(m, n, Þ, g), G(m, 9, p), G(m, 7), we must, have
