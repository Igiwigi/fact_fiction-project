At these conditions, typical energy per one streamer/filament, that is for one
combustion kernel, was estimated as 5-20 J for stoichiometric mixtures [9]. It should be noted
that deposited energy measured for methane-containing mixtures with different stoichiometries
is visibly (more than one order of magnitude) different, although theoretically calculated energy
branching in the discharge is practically the same. This fact confirms that the experimental study
of the discharges in combustible mixtures at elevated pressures is a very important issue for
understanding of physics and chemistry of PAC. At the same time, the current knowledge about the nSDBD development in non-combustible
mixtures is scarce. This section summarizes the information about the nanosecond surface DBD
discharge in air at P = 1-6 atm at voltage amplitude 20-60 kV on the electrode.
