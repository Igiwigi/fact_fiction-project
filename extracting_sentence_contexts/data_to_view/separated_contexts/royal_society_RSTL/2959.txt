in'the capillaries, where the blood receives a freſh addition of
phlogiſton. If, in theſe circumſtances, the blood during each

revolution were to beequally impregnated with this latter prin-
Sciple, it is manifeſt, that the whole effect of the above proceſs
Zwould be to cool the ſyſtem at the center, and to.heat it at the
ſurface; or to convey the heat to that part of the body where
Sit is capable of being inſtantly carried off by evaporation, But
S1t appears, from the experiments which- have been laſt recited,
that, when an animal is- placed in a heated medium, the ſan-
Zguincous maſs, during each revolution, is /e/ impregnated with
=phlogiſton ; for we have ſeen, that the venous blood, 1n theſe
'ZCircumſtances, becomes gradually paler and paler in its colour
till at length it acquires very nearly the appearance of the ar-
Qterial : and it is rendered highly probable by the experiments of
Z Dr. yxIESTLEY, that the dark and livid colour of the blood in
= the veins depends upon its combination with phlogiſton in the
Z minute veſſels, Since, therefore, in a heated medium, this fluid-
Z does not aſſume the ſame livid hue, we may conclude, that it
2 (does not_attra&t an equal quantity of the phlogiſtic principle *. A © * Itis of no conſequence in the above argument, whether we ſuppoſe, with
Dr. exrestLEY, that the alteration of colour in the blood depends upon its com-
bination with phlogiſton in the capillary arteries, or maintain: with ſome other
philoſophers that this alteration ariſes from a change produced in the blood itſelf by
the action of the veſſels; it is ſufficient for our purpoſe to aſſime it as 2 fact,
which, I think, has been proved by dire&t experiment, that, in the natural ſtate

of the animal, the blood undergoes a change in the capillaries, by which its capa-

city for containing heat diminiſhed ; and that in a heated medium it does nov

yadergo 3 ſimilar change,
