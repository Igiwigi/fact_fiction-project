Next, we note that the generators of translations in time and space are given by the
Hamiltonian H and the momentum operators P, respectively. They are distinguished by the
discrete symmetries of charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P) and time reversal (T) in
the sense that only the temporal generator expresses violations of the symmetries. In fact, the
violations are only seen in the time evolution of various particle decays and thus in translations
over time. This suggests that the discrete symmetry violations may provide a phenomenological
basis for the kind of time-space asymmetry needed for dynamics to emerge in accord with
principle 2.1. In particular, if H represents the Hamiltonian for evolving into the future, then the
Hamiltonian for the time-reversed evolution into the past is 7-!'HT where T is Wignerâ€™s time
reversal operator [15].
