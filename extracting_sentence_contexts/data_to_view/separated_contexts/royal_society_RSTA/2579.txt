For each wire the
constants yo and ¢ of the formula y = yy[1+¢(@=)] were determined graphically. The constant yo
varies slightly with the radius and its value is not far removed from that required by the theory of
Section 6. The value of y, for Wire No. 2 shows a discrepancy which was explained, on microscopic
observation, as due to the fact that owing to the use of an imperfect die the wire was badly scored along
its length.
