Boric acid and MoS, powder can also be used

as an additive to the natural oil. Friction and wear experiments show that
he nanoscale (20nm) particle boric acid additive lubricants significantly
outperformed all of the other lubricants with respect to frictional and wear
yerformance. In fact, the nanoscale boric acid powder-based lubricants
exhibited a wear rate more than an order of magnitude lower than the
loS2 and larger sized boric acid additive-based lubricants (M. R. Lovell,
