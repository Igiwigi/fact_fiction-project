region has been completed.

For the present the calculated values serve mainly to place a limit upon the
maximum error from all sources that can be ascribed to the measurements now
recorded. The readings for the red zine line appear to be quite abnormal, as they
differ from the calculated value by 0°°006 per mm. and cannot be brought into agree-
ment by any modification of the constants without spoiling the concordance of the
rest of the figures. Deviations amounting to nearly 0°°004 per mm. are observed in
the case of the blue cadmium line; but these form part of a group of negative
differences and must be attributed, at least to some extent, to imperfections in the
formula, which (as has already been suggested) requires the addition of a fourth
arbitrary constant to bring it into complete accord with the experimental figures.
The necessity for a fourth term is shown by the fact that whilst the concordance
between the observed and calculated values is very good at the ends and in the
middle of the series, the differences being

Li 6708, +0°0003; Hg 5461, +0°0009 ; Hg 4359, +0°0006 ;

there is a predominance of positive differences in the first twelve and of negative
differences in the last twelve values.

Thus, if all the values be included, the average differences are
