M. ERICH LAXMANN, late Profeflor of Mineralogy:
and Chemiſtry at Peterſburg, was reſident in 1765 at Bar
naul in Siberia, lat. 53* N. and long. 81* E. as miniſter to
the German congregation of the Kolyvan Province. On the*
- firſt day of that year, he ſaw the thermometer down fo low as
— 58*+; whence it is probable, that ſome part at leaſt of the”
quickfilver was congealed, As no concomitant circumſtances
are recorded with this fact, it would ſcarcely have been worth
mentioning, were it not to introduce an account of ſome in:
ſtruments, which became afterwards the ſubje of very curious
obſervations. For M. LaxMann, during his abode in thi
remote country, employed his leiſure in the conſtruQtion of ba;
rometers and thermometers, an art in which he acquired grea!
{kill.” Theſe he afterwards diſtributed, free of expence, to all

ba Vorigi en Siberie, p. 84. and 93.
