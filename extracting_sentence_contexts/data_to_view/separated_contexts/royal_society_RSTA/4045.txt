I have
accordingly made use of a number of tables of magnetic results* at Mauritius,
published in a convenient form in 1899. In D, data are given for the period
1875 to 1890, in H for 1883 to 1890, and in V for 1884 to 1890. The shortness of
the two latter periods, and the fact that the data are not contemporaneous with
those for most of the other stations, are drawbacks, but there is small choice of
magnetic data in low latitudes.

182 DR. C, CHREE: AN ENQUIRY INTO THE NATURE OF THE RELATIONSHIP

On examining the tables, I found that the mean D ranges in 1881 and 1882—years
of fairly large sun-spot frequency—showed a remarkable depression, being only about
half those in 1880 and 1883, and in the preface I found the following editorial
reference to some readjustment of the declination magnetograph in December, 1882 :
“Tn the latter part of the year 1882 the effect of torsion on the magnetograph is
very pronounced.”
