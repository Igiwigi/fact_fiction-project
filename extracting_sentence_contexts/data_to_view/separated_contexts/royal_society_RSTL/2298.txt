Nevertheless, although the
corpus uteri exists in these genera, the true vagina is as remarkable for its length
and capacity as in those in which the corpus uteri has ceased to exist. Hitherto the vagina has presented itself under the form of a simple undivided
canal, communicating with the urethro-sexual passage, at least after impregnation,
by a single aperture. But it is a remarkable and interesting fact that in the Sloth,
in the Mare and Ass, in the Pig, in the Cow, and probably also in other Ruminants,
the vagina in the virgin state communicates with the urethro-sexual passage by a
