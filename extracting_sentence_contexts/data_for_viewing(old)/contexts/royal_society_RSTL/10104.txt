missure.

b. Projection of posterior olfactory fasciculus into the occipital lobe.

c. Connexion of the latter fasciculus also with the cortex of the vertex,

d. Peculiar connexion of the same fasciculus with the corpus striatum.

e. Relationships of olfactory area at greatest depth below cortex.

F. Descent of the tenia semicircularis into olfactory area.

The above facts may be confirmed by placing the brain of the Rat in its natural
position with the vertex upwards, and keeping it during dissection moistened occa-
sionally by a few drops of a 2 per cent. 8olution of common salt. With a delicate
pair of dissecting scissors the membranes stretching across between the hemispheres are
divided through their whole length, and the latter sliced off horizontally outwards
upon a level with the corpus callosum by a sharp and fine scalpel. This commissure is
next divided along the median line from behind forwards, each segment being turned
outwards. Such a section exposes the corpus striatum in its extra- and intra-
