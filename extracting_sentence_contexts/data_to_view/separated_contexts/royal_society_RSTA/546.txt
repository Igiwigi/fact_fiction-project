If the residual errors are too high, another updating loop is
performed, using a different set of initial conditions. The measured data are usually displayed in the form of FRFs, while—at the present time—
the evaluation of the system is generally performed in a time-domain framework. Time-domain
simulations are generally very slow due to the small time steps involved and the fact that they
must evaluate through all the transient information to get to a steady state. This scales poorly
with the dimension of the system and results in a difficult correlation process, requiring extensive
resources and post-processing effort in order to trim the transients and cast numerical data in
the same domain as experimental data. This heavy post-processing adds to the evaluation time,
rendering the updating process unacceptably slow.
