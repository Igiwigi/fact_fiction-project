Passing by the form which I suppose at one time existed similar to Siphonogorgia
but not dimorphie, we should obtain such forms as Briarers, in which the body-
cavities of the polyps are shorb ; there is no solid axis and no dimorphism, and from
such genera, Celogorgia, Solenogorgia, &e., might be obtained by the development of
large canals in the axis of the colony, or again by the development of horny or cal-
careous axes, we should obtain the remaining families of Gorgonacte, Primnoacere, &e.

702 MR. 8. J. HICKSON ON THE CILTATED GROOVE

In the Primnoacer T have shown that there is no siphonoglyphe, and the negative
evidence of other authors affords us strong evidence for supposing that it is absent in
the Gorgonacew, In both these families there is only a thin layer of ccenenchym
covering the solid axis. If these two facts are mutually dependent upon one another,
as I suppose them to be, there is sufficient reason for separating those forms which
have only a thin ecnenchym covering the axis, and into which the polyps are never
completely retracted, and in which there is no siphonoglyphe, into a distinet group. This group might retain the name of the Gorgonide, whilst other genera which do
not possess these characters and which were formerly included in the Gorgonidm,
might be placed in another group of the Alcyonaria altogether. Provisionally, then, the Alcyonaria might be divided into the following groups :—
