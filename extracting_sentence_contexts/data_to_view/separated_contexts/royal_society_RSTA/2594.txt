A number of interesting features are
apparent. Firstly, note that the t =0 values for the four simulations increasingly depart from the
expected ideal RSDL as the solid volume per cent increases. This is a consequence of the fact
that our initialization of the domain, which is based on a thinned continuous pseudorandom
algorithm, leads to an apparent ordering; that is an artefact. This arises as the domain is
progressively initialized with finite area particles; the remaining space induces a filtering such
that a truly random choice is moderated by the available locations that can accommodate a
particle. Secondly, it is interesting to note that for any individual simulation, there is not a large
change in the solid per cent of the mobile region as the simulation proceeds.
