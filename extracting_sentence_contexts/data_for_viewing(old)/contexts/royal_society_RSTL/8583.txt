AS A VEHICLE OF SOUND. 229

c. Its liability to be quenched or deflected by an opposing wind, 0 as to be practically
useless at a yery short distance to windward, is very remarkable. A case has been cited
in which the gun failed to be heard against a violent wind at a distance of 550 yards
from the place of firing, the sound of the syren at the same time reaching us with great
intensity.

Still, notwithstanding these drawbacks, I think the gun is entitled to rank as a first-
class 8ignal. I have had occasion myself to observe its extreme utility at Holyhead and
the Kish light-vessel. The commanders of the Holyhead boats, moreover, are unanimous
in their commendation of the gun. An important addition in its favour is the fact that
the flash often comes to the aid of the sound: on this point the evidence cited in the
Appendix is quite conclusive.

There may be cases in which the combination of the gun with one of the other signals
may be desirable. Where it is wished to confer an unmistakable individuality on a fog-
8ignal tation, 8uch a combination might with adyantage be resorted to.

If the gun be retained as one form of fog-signal (and I should be sorry, at present,
to recommend its total abolition) it ought to be of the most suitable description. Our
experiments prove the sound of the gun to be dependent on its shape ; but we do not
know that we haye employed the best shape. 'This suggests the desirability of con-
structing a gun with special reference to the production of sound *.
