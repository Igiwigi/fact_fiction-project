The finite-difference expression
for a derivative at the end-point 0 of a range is given by

h(dw/dx), = AkR—4A3-+4A3—JA$+.... (A.7)

This formula, however, is rather slowly convergent, and an alternative method is preferable. In this second method the equation (A. 6) is applied at boundary points such as 0 in
figure 1, as well as at internal points. A ‘fictitious’ point —1 is now introduced, and the
boundary condition is used to obtain its value, in terms of those at points on and internal to
the boundary, from a much more rapidly convergent expression.

With reference to figure 2, it can be shown that at a boundary point such as 0 the derivative
is given by

h(dw/dx), = AL, os ius M,, (A. 8)

and, at a boundary point like 6,

h(@w/08)~V}— 3 a Vi (A.9)
If the differences are now written in terms of functional values, an expression can be obtained
for the fictitious value —1 in terms of the boundary derivative and boundary and internal
values. Table 1 gives expressions for w_,, together with the error term or difference cor-
rection, according to the number (r) of differences replaced by pivotal values. TABLE 1

Similar expressions for w, can be obtained from this table by changing thesign of h, replacing
5 w, by we, w, by w;, etc.; in the error term backward differences replace forward differences
a and the factor (— 1)" becomes — 1.
