The predicted magnitude of the skew in the fre- N,, regions with stronger local BGS and, therefore, smaller
quency of variants is particularly evident when incorporating local Ne will reach equilibrium much faster than those with
DFEs with weakly selected mutations and when recombina- weaker local BGS and greater N,. For long periods (in the hun-
tion is reduced or absent, but it is also expected for a wide dreds of thousands of years for Drosophila owing to its large
range of recombination rates as long as the number of sites population size), regions with weak BGS will likely exhibit
under selection is high. In fact, an excess of rare mutations more extreme non-equilibrium patterns than those with mod-
due to BGS is expected across most of the genome for species erate or strong BGS. Figure 3a shows that regions with high
with a range of recombination rates like D. melanogaster recombination (moderate BGS, blue lines) are much slower in
[79,100]. These patterns of polymorphism predicted by BGS recovering expected levels of neutral diversity than those
models and confirmed by simulations could be easily under- with low and very low recombination (green and red lines,
stood as evidence of population expansion and BGS is also respectively).
