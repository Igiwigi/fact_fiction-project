224 (. H. WADDINGTON : EXPERIMENTS ON THE

We have as yet discussed competence only as regards a single-stage. process of
differentiation. Hoapiey’s experiments tested competence in our sense, but with
reference to a series of processes which was, in different cases, halted at different stages.
Hoap.ey argues as if the stage attained in this series was a direct measurement of the
potentiality with which the processes were started in the first place, so that he could say
that in one case the tissue was isolated when it had a definite potentiality to form primi-
tive epidermis, and in another case when it was capable of differentiating to brain.
But it is probable that the tissue when isolated was, in fact, non-competent with regard
to the later processes of differentiation which it finally performed. In such a series of
processes it is probable that the later members are dependent on the harmonious
(spatial or otherwise) realisation of the earlier. It is thus possible that Hoapiey’s
older explants differentiated further than the young, not only because they were com-
petent for further stages of differentiation but also partly because they were more
competent for the earlier stages and thus performed them more harmoniously. Mangoup
(1928) has pointed out that exceptional cases of very complete differentiation do occur
in isolated pieces of tissue.

It is also unfortunate that Hoap.ry isolated the ectoderm and endoderm together,
so that it is impossible to say where the competencies are localised ; while the added
possibilities for the occurrence of induction make the interpretation of a series of processes
