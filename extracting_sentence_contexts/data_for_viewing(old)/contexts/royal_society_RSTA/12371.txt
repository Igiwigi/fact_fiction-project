2 $1. Touracos, Turacin, and Copper in Animals.

Syox the publication of my paper on Turacin,* read before the Society in May, 1869,
Sveral interesting facts have come to light in reference to the Touracos, and to the
@ecurrence of copper in the animal kingdom. Before giving the results of my own
yrther researches, I would first of all mention the book on “ Angola and the River
Gongo” by the late J. J. Monretro.t In the second volume of this work, pp. 75 to
Q, will be found some curious particulars about two species of Turacus (Corythaix),
is well as an account of Mr. H. Basserr’s experiments with turacin, to which further
Igference will presently be made. Mr. Monrerro describes a singular trait manifested
one of his tame plantain-eaters, a Turacus schalowi, which showed marked
light in gaily coloured dresses and pictures. Several instances are given of Touracos
In captivity having moulted and then renewed their crimson plumage with all its
original richness of colour. Some feathers from these birds, which Mr. Monrerro
handed to me for examination, were found, by optical tests, to contain a turacin
identical with that which colours them in their native countries. Yet these feathers had
