Hydrolysed Substance “A” is oxidized by permanganate, in acetone solution,
almost quantitatively to a ketopentadecoic acid (p. 325), which on reduction
gives an almost quantitative yield of n-pentadecoic acid (p. 325).

6. The ketopentadecoic acid arising as an oxidation product of hydrolysed Substance
“ A.” was shown by synthesis to be the y-keto-acid (p. 326), thus indicating that
the hydroxyl group in hydrolysed Substance “A” is in the y-position to the
terminal carboxyl group. These facts prove conclusively that Substance “ A” is the lactone of y-hydroxy-
83-dicarboxypentadecoic acid of the formula (1) and hydrolysed Substance “A” is
thus y-hydroxy-$5-dicarboxypentadecoic acid, formula (2). The breakdown of
Substance “ A” on oxidation to y-ketopentadecoic acid, formula (3) and to n-penta-
decoic acid formula (4), is shown in the following scheme in which is also given the
relation of Substance ‘‘ A” to its fusion products, lauric acid, formula (5), succinic acid
and CO,. VOL.
