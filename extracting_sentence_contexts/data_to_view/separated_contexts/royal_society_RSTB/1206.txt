Jaca. (= L. mandioccanum. Rapp.)

Specimens of this species were supplied to me from the Botanic Garden of Brus
These show the sporangium to be similar as regards form to those of L. phlegme
and carinatum (fig. 92) though the stalk is somewhat more massive, and the ยง
archesporial pad is more largely developed. The chief interest, however, in
sporangia of this species lies in the fact that the wall of the sporangium is of uni
thickness. A detailed examination shows that the wall of the sporangium con
of some 4-7 layers of cells (figs. 52, 53); the number is not exactly defined, nor is
arrangement of the cells very regular ; the outermost layer develops with thicker
as in other species; the innermost is the tapetum, while between these inter
several layers of thin-walled cells, which evidently have been increased in numb
periclinal divisions (fig. 52). The development shows that this is the case, and
the difference between this and other species is due to additional periclinal di
in the wall, and not to the contribution of tissues from the sporogenous mass
tissues of the wall.
