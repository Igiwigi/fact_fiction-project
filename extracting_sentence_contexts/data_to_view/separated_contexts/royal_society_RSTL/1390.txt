Havixe been induced in December last to. visit Yorkshire,
for the purpose of investigating the circumstances of the cave
at Kirkdale, near Kirby Moorside, about 25 miles N, N. E. of
the city of York, in which a discovery was made last summer
of a singular collection of teeth and bones, I beg to lay be-
fore the Royal Society the result of my observations on this
new and interesting case, and to point out s0me important
general conclusions that arise from it. The facts I have collected, seem calculated to throw an
important light on the state of our planet at a period antece-
dent to the last great convulsion that has affected its surface ;
and I may add, in limine, that they afford one of the most
complete and satisfactory chains of consistent circumstantial
evidence I have ever met with-in the course of my geological
investigations. As I shall haye frequent occasion to make use of the word

diluvium, it may be necessary to premise, that I apply it to
those extensive and general deposits of superficial gravel,
which appear to have been produced by the last great con-
vulsion that has affected our planet ; and that with regard to
the indications afforded by geology of such a convulsion, I
entirely coincide with the views of-M.
