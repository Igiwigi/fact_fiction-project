This is obviously equivalent to the boundary conditions (1.4) or (1.5) in the case of classical
solutions; in particular, it is equivalent to (1.5) when u € C°(2) with w > 1/2. However, when
a € (0, 1/2], which included the Onsager’s critical exponent a = 1/3, (1.8) is a weaker formulation
than (1.5) for the boundary condition of pressure in the framework of weak solution to the Euler
equations in the presence of a boundary. This is because the left-hand side of (1.8) involves the
sum of two terms, which we will show makes sense at the boundary, while each term might
not necessarily be regular enough to make sense at the boundary on its own. It is this boundary
condition that we will be adopting in this contribution.

In spite of the fact that we strongly believe that the same type of result will hold in the three-
dimensional case, which is a subject of future work, we consider only the two-dimensional case
for the following reasons.

(i) Although the result seems to be very natural, the proof turned out to be more elaborate
than expected. Therefore, we choose to consider a situation where we can provide the full
details, while keeping the presentation user friendly.

(ii) We use a global localization near the boundary, which may not be absolutely compulsory
in the present case, but as stated in §4, this idea may be extremely useful for companion
problems where the analyticity properties have to be preserved.

This study is organized as follows:
