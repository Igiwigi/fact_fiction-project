manner described and by confining attention to the stronger lines. The principal
doublets are scarcely open to doubt, and the diffuse doublets and satellites are in almost
as strong a position, The 2p—2s linesare usually weak, and lie in a portion of the spectrum
not very accurately measurable, but it was rarely that any alternative pairs were
found, and in those spectra where no definite choice between pairs of lines complying

equally well with the tests available could be made, no lines have been placed in the
tables, or the fact has been indicated.

The fundamental lines seem satisfactory on the whole; they are strong lines and not
difficult to pick out. There is some uncertainty about the satellites, but the 4f —5g pair
when it can be found strengthens the identification made. These points are entered
into in § 5 as they arise in considering each spectrum. It is only necessary to point out
here that the methods employed are not capable of yielding definite proof of the identity
of lines, but make the identifications adopted probable to the degree I have indicated.

§ 7. Inconclusion, I gladly take this opportunity of making acknowledgments to those
whose courtesy and assistance have made this work possible. In the first place, my
thanks are due to Prof. R. A. MizurKkan for his kindness in allowing me the freedom
of his new vacuum spectrograph in his laboratory at Pasadefia, and for much information
