(a, 6, eXw, y)*=0,

the equation of any other point-pair whatever can be expressed, and that in two different
ways, in the form (a, 8, eXz, y)*+(lx+my)'=0;

the points ({/7+my=0) corresponding to the two admissible values of the linear Zune:
tion being in fact the harmonics of the point-pair in reaper to the given point-pair
(a, 6, eX#, y)*=0, or what is the same thing, the sbiconjugate points of the involution
formed by the two point-pairs (see Fifth Memoir, N 0. 105), The point-patr represented
by the equation in question does not in itself stand in any peculiar relation to the given
point pair (a, 6, Xx, y)*=0 ; but when thus reprezented it is Said to be inscribed in the
given point-pair, and the point {x+my=0 is said to be the axis of InSorlÞtion. ; And the
harmonic of this point with respect to the given point-pair (that is, the other SIbiconjugate
point of the involution of the two point-pairs) is said to be the centre of inscription *.

inscribed point-pair in the form
