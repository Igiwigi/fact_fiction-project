This issue is conceptual,
and it needs to be properly understood first before even starting
to think about empirical work/research to generate data that
could help translating the inferential concept into practice.

(b) Improving transparency

This is a call for greater candour in case files, report writing
and the presentation of findings in court: to be able to articu-
late the weight to be assigned to each feature considered
without resorting to comfort statements such as ‘friction
ridge skin impressions are unique’,* ‘all three levels of fea-
tures have been used in conjunction’, or ‘it is my opinion
based on my training and experience’. Is it just an opinion? Yes, it is, and, at the moment, it does
not offer a lot to the fact finder to assess its quality. I agree
with Cole [77], there is a risk in ‘opinionization’ because it
can range from respectful informed opinions to mere
opinions. But more crucially, an opinion of say ‘identification’
between a mark and a print cannot be critically assessed.
