The intestines also present a
parallel to the arteries, in the fact that contractions of their unstriped muscular fibres
-Zreult from arrest of the circulation in them ; and IT have lately shown+ that these
= movements are not due to any influence exerted directly upon the contractile tissue,
2but that the intestinal nerves are essential to their production. Thus we have support
2 from analogy for the view that the muscular contractions which occur under similar cir-
'z cumstances in the arteries are induced by nervous agency. 5 The fact that the contraction produced in an artery of the frog's web by pressure
Supon a particular point affects a considerable extent of the vessel, instead of being
\& limited to the spot irritated, is also an argument for the existence of a local coordinating
=apparatus ; for T find that this occurrence continues to take place in an amputated
S limb. The observation was made on the 4th of August, 1858. One of the hind legs
got a frog having been removed after a ligature had been passed round the thigh 80 as to
S prevent escape of the blood, pressure was made with a fine but blunt instrument over a
= particular point in the course of a large artery, whose calibre had previously been accu-
E rately determined by micrometer.
