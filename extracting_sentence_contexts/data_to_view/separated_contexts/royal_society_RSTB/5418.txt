In the ala
temporalis the lamina ascendens has appeared. The processus alaris comes into contact
with the ala temporalis, but there is no fusion. â€˜The position and relations of the lamina
pterygoidea of the ala temporalis might give rise to the suspicion that it represented the
pterygoid cartilage, were it not for the fact that at a later stage the pterygoid cartilage
is present, separate and distinct from the lamina pterygoidea. Jutting forward from the front of the cochlear capsule is a process of cartilage which
extends towards, but does not reach, the point of contact between ala temporalis and
processus alaris, on cach side. This process is the rudiment of the alicochlear commis-
sure, which will eventually form a complete lateral boundary to the carotid foramen.
