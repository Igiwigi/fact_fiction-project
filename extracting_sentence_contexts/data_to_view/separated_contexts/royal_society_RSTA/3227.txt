According to BrcquerEeL: “ by
depositing on one of the Ag plates a thin layer of iodide, obtained by the action of
the vapour of iodine at the ordinary temperature and then exposing this plate to
light, it was found that it took positive electricity from the liquid. With a thick
layer of iodine on the surface of the Ag, there is on the contrary a current the
inverse of the proceeding, ¢.c., the plate exposed to light*took negative electricity ” ;
further, “ whilst with precipitated chloride and bromide of silver placed on plates of
platinum there is always produced a current of the same sense, the exposed plate
being positive ; with a layer deposited on Ag there is an effect depending upon the
thickness of this layer.” ‘These two inverse facts indicate that there should
necessarily be a thickness of layer for which the electric effect is almost nothing ”
