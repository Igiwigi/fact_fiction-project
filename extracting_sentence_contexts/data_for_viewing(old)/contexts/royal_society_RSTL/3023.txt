a brown iron ochre with quartz, &c. named © gossan” by the miners, is almost
invariably found resting on copper. Sulphuret of zinc occurs sometimes in the
same situation, both with regard to copper and lead ; but tin ore, which is a
non-conductor, is without either, and is mostly found nearer the surface than
copper.

Tin veins are usually intersected by those of copper when they do not coin-
cide in their horizontal direction or underlie ; thus, in this case, the conducting
veins trayerse the non-conducting ones. And when two veins of copper meet
at opposite angles in descending, they are, I apprehend, generally found to be
unproductive at and near the place of junction ; but when they unite, proceeding
downward in the same direction but at different angles, they are commonly
observed to be enriched. 'Dhese facts appear curious when regarded in con-
nection with the opposite currents of electricity in veins having opposite dips.

There are some districts in this county in which the ore veins have generally
a north underlie, and in others the south prevails ; and it often happens that
when lodes occur which deviate from the prevalent underlie of the others, in
any district, the former are intersected, and sometimes shifted by the latter.
This is strikingly the case in numerous mines in the parishes of St. Agnes and
Perran.

The usual horizontal bearing of the copper and tin veins in our principal
mining districts, appears to be nearly E. and W., or rather from E.N.E. to
W.S.W.; but in others they deviate materially from these directions, sometimes
