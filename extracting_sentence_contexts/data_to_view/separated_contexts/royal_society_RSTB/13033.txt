This also implies that during consolidation, memories not
only become stronger (in the sense that they are protected
from interference) but they can also change, at least partially. It has long been known that memory consolidation and
retrieval—but of course also memory-based imagination
[140-142]—are highly constructive processes [143-145]. One
example of constructive memory is the fact that some mem-
ories can be (unconsciously) completed with information
that is coherent with them, or just imagined—thus giving
rise to ‘false memories’, e.g. the memory that Tom was at
my last birthday party. Similarly, specific elements not
initially present in an episodic memory can ‘intrude’ later
on, when the memory is consolidated or retrieved—perhaps
to make the memory (retrospectively) coherent with novel
information (e.g. if I am told that Tom was at the party);
with some ‘schematic’ information (e.g. Tom attends all par-
ties); or with one’s self-image.
