diameter. As a matter of fact, however, the shattering is probably merely one of the
means of dissipating the strain energy of the strong fibre, which at fracture is perhaps
10,000 times that of silica in the ordinary weak state. An elastic wave is doubtless
propagated from the original fracture, and the stresses due to this wave shatter the
rod. Confirmation of this view is obtainable if the fibre is broken by twisting instead of
by bending.
