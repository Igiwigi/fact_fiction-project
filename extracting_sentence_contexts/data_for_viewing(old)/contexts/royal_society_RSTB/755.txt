The yeast, on the other hand, benefits by these substances being removed and
_lestroyed, hence its renewed and continued activity—as evinced by the steady and

Scopious evolution of carbon dioxide for weeks, and the corresponding increase of the
a yeast- -cells by budding—when the symbiosis is established.

= For the present this can only be regarded as a hypothesis. It might be objected
that T have inverted the order of events—that, since the Schizomycete is able to
a evolve small quantities of carbon dioxide daily, from saccharine solutions, it may be
S that its powers are enhanced by the yeast-removing inhibiting substances of its
~ Sactivity. The objection is possibly valid, but I think the former hypothesis explains
5 most facts : how, for instance, is it to be explained that the Schizomycete slowly and
steadily converts the whole of the liquid sugar-solution into a solid gelatinous mass,
‘2if the organism excretes such inhibiting substances ?

3 All these questions must wait for answers, however, until we obtain some know-
Sledge of the products of the several fermentations, and compare those formed by the
‘2two organisms separately, with those developed by the symbiotic Ginger-beer plant
as a whole.

= In conclusion, it may be pointed out that my researches have so far been directed
£ almost entirely to elucidating the morphology and physiology—.e., the biology—of
