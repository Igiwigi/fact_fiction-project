In the latter publication, after
describing various appearances of the aurora, I stated that these appearances indicated
the following necessary results :—

* 1st. That the aurora borealis always presents itself in definite and very curious
relations to the lines of magnetism indicated by the needle.

* 2nd. That the streamers, in the direction of their length, coincide with the plane
of the dip of the needle, or nearly 80; and that each individual streamer is, in fact,
parallel to the dipping-needle.

*©3rd. That they [the streamers] form a thin fringe, stretching often a great way
from east to west at right angles to the magnetic meridian.

*4th. That the fringe moves away from the north magnetic pole, by the extinction
of streamers at its northern face, and the formation of new ones, contiguous to its
southern face.
