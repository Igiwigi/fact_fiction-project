pearance of objects only in the plane of the horopter to depend on other principles,
from which he deduced, contrary to AGuiLon1Us, that the objects which are doubled
do not appear in the plane of the horopter, but in other places which are determined
by these principles. Dr. WeLLs was led to his new theory by a fact which he acci-
dentally observed, and which he could not reconcile with any existing theory of
visible direction ; this fact had, though he was unaware of it, been previously noticed
by Dr. Sura ; it is already mentioned in \ 8., and is the only instance of binocular
vision of relief which I have found recorded previous to my own investigations. $0
little does Dr. WELLs's theory appear to have been understood, that no subsequent
writer has attempted either to confirm or disprove his opinions. It would be useless
here to discuss the principles of this theory, which was framed to account for an ano-
malous individual fact, since it is inconsistent with the general rules on which that
fact has been now shown to depend. Notwithstanding these erroneous views, the

remarks, the truth of which are independent of the theory they were intended to
illustrate.


MR. WHEATSTONE ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION, 389

The theory which has obtained greatest currency is that which assumes that an
object is seen single because its pictures fall on corresponding points of the two re-
tinze, that is on points which are similarly sitnated with respect to the two centres
both in distance and position. This theory supposes that the pictures projected on
the retinz are exactly similar to each other, corresponding points of the two pictures
