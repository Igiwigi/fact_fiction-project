There is accordingly a sharp demarcation between the development of the
temporary larval organs and the permanent organs of the adult. XIâ€”DEvVELOPMENT oF LARVAL STRUCTURES

From the account given of the abbreviated development of certain Molgulae
(BeRRILL, 1931), it is obvious that the development of the whole larval complex of
notochord, muscle, neural tube and sense organs may be suppressed without
affecting the development of any of the permanent organs. This consideration,
together with the fact that in the urodele development the chordal and muscle cells
cease dividing and commence their final differentiation at a very early stage, whereas

the tissue cells of the permanent organs divide indefinitely, suggests that there are
two independent developmental mechanisms proceeding side by side.
