In the stronger field however, the effect of the return of magnetisability, at the
same temperature, is much more pronounced than in the earlier experiments. 550° 600° 650° 700° = 750° 800°C

These differences are no doubt due to the fact that in weak fields the susceptibility of
the iron in the eutectoid is much smaller compared with that of the excess iron than
it is in strong fields. VOL, COXV.—A, 2B
