loma adrantoides, all of which possess annular steles and medullary strands. He
adds that in the Cyatheaceous genera the medullary bundles may branch off from the
annular stele, or, as in Pteris, the axial strand may end free in the pith in the form
of a fine prosenchymatous termination.* These facts are of interest in connection
with the behaviour of the axial strand of Matonia, which has been noticed in the
foregoing description. Another point of comparison is afforded by Merrenius’
description of the petiolar stele in Dennstadia being supplied by the outer tube and
by the medullary strand in the centre of the stem. This is analogous to the contri-
x bution made by the smaller stele of Metonia to the vascular system of the frond,
S which is mainly, but not entirely, derived from the large outer stele.
