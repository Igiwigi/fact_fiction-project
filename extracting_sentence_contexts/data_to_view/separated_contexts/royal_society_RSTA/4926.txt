It is difficult to account for this. the platinum black had got contaminated with traces of organic matter in any
neeivable way, then possibly the carbon might annex some of the oxygen, and this
ould afterwards reappear as carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide formed in this way
would occupy the same volume as the original oxygen, and some weight is lent to
‘is hypothesis by the fact that the sum of the oxygen and carbon dioxide is more
rly constant. Platinum black, dried at 100° C., thus contains rather less than 100 volumes, or
bout 0°66 per cent. by weight of oxygen.
