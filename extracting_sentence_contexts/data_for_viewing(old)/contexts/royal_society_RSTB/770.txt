A. haastii (fig. 210), and in the skeleton in the Wellington Museum marked
A. maxima, but probably referable to A. bulleri (fig. 211), the corpus sterni presents
a distinct median longitudinal thickening (4.) along its anterior half, the result being
the production of a low ridge nearly as well marked as the vestigial keel of Stringops.
In a skeleton of A. australis in the Canterbury Museum (fig. 209), there is a very
poorly developed ridge, which projects on the inner or dorsal surface of the bone
instead of on the ventral or outer surface, as in all other cases.

On the hypothesis that the Ratite are descended from birds which possessed the
power of flight, the occasional occurrence by reversion of a vestigial keel is precisely
what might be expected. The absence of a special osteite (lophosteon) for the keel
hardly appears to be of such fundamental importance as it is sometimes assumed to
be. I should rather take the presence or absence of such a bone as a fact of the same
rank as the presence or absence of a distinct centre of ossification in the spines of the
thoracic vertebree of mammals. But this is a point upon which the development of
the sternum in Stringops should throw light.

In one skeleton of A. australis there is an exception to the usual rule that four
sternal ribs are articulated to the sternum; on the left side the fifth thoracic rib is
attached by a true joint, the articular cavity being on the proximal end of the
posterior lateral process.
