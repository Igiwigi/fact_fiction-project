It is
in any case unlikely that, as postulated by Rowan, disturbance alone would cause any
acceleration in gonad growth. Bissonnette (1931) has shown experimentally that nightly
disturbance without extra light is insufficient to induce any abnormal growth of starling
gonads. Because of these points, Rowan’s theory has been rejected, and on evidence given in full
earlier in this paper, it is suggested that the only theory which will fit the known facts is
that the precociously developing type of starling is actually the resident British bird, and
that the other type is an immigrant from the Continent of Europe. This theory would also
fit Rowan’s facts as, except in very bad weather, flocks of Continental starlings are not
commonly seen in towns. The lack of sexually stimulated birds which he observed in the
country was probably due to the fact that a sufficiently large sample was not taken.
