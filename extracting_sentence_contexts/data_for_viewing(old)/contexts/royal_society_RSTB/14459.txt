we presented 10 Eurasian jays, Garrulus glandarius, with a delayed mainten-
ance task, which measured the ability to choose a preferred outcome as well
as the ability to sustain the delay prior to that outcome. Jays were able to
wait for better possibilities, but maximum wait times varied across the sub-
jects. We also presented them with five cognitive tasks that assessed spatial

their performance. Performance in these tasks was correlated significantly

behaviour, cognition, evolution strates that self-control and intelligence are correlated in jays. The fact that

this correlation exists in diverse species suggests that self-control is a funda-

mental feature of cognition. Our results are discussed in the context of
