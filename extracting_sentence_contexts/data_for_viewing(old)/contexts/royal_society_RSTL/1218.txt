received unusual quantities of liquids, and in that state have
found invariably, that the corpuscles of Cuvigs, which were
the glands of MarLeiGni, are distinct cells, containing a fluid,
which escapes when the cells are punctured, and renders their
membranous, coat visible, so that it would appear that the
distension of these cells is connected with the state of the sto-
mach, and therefore only takes place occasionally ; and that
the elastic capsule by which the spleen is surrounded adapts
the organ to, these changes in its volume.

On examining further into the structure of the spleen, in
which I have been materially assisted by Mr. Brop1s, the
following facts have been ascertained.

- In the spleen of the bullock, horse, and hog, the cells, when
