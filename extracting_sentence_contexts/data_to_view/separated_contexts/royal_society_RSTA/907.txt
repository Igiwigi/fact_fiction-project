The state of a system is all there is to predict measurement outcomes.

3. A composite state determines states of subsystems (so the local state of S is restored when the
state of the whole S and € is restored). These facts help to characterize local states of entangled systems without using reduced density
matrices. They follow from quantum theory: locality is a property of interactions. The other two
facts define the role and the relation of the quantum states of individual and composite systems in
a way that does not invoke density matrices (to which we are not entitled in the absence of Born’s
Rule).
