spherical T.N.T. charges. This, it is suggested at near ranges, is due to (a) the less accurate
method of mounting gauges and charges when the T.N.T. records were obtained, (b) the
fact that the calculated charge radius 1-745in. (R) being greater than the actual charge
radius of the cylindrical block 1-225 in., the nearest point of the charge to the gauge is greater
than if the charge were a sphere, (c) directional effects from a finite cylindrical block of
explosive, and (d) detonation not reaching the charge surface at the same instant.

Shock-wave time-constant
The experimental time-constant plots for spherical P.E. and cylindrical T.N.T. explosives
are shown on figures 9 and 10. The theoretical derived curves of Kirkwood & Bethe (1943)
for spherical T.N.T. charges are superimposed on both these figures for comparison, and
the agreement is certainly fairly satisfactory considering that the Kirkwood-Bethe theory
(figure 6) gives too high values for peak pressures.
