rather with logic interrelations. In Hilbert’s language the axiomatic treatment of a discipline
implies in no sense a definitive formulation of specific axioms as eternal truths, but rather


the following methodological demand: specify the assumptions at the beginning of your
deliberation, stop for a moment and investigate whether or not these assumptions are partly
superfluous or contradict each other. [34]

The development of physics from the beginning of the century, and especially after 1905,
brought many surprises that Hilbert could not have envisaged in 1900 or even when he lectured
at Gottingen on the axioms of physics in 1905; yet, Hilbert was indeed able to accommodate these
new developments to the larger picture of physics afforded by his programme for axiomatization.
In fact, some of his later contributions to mathematical physics, particularly his contributions to
GTR, came by way of realizing the vision embodied in this programme.
