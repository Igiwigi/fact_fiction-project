Dormancy is a common feedforward strategy to enable
For example, plants upregulate photosynthetic machinery persistence in variable environments [94-96]. Dormancy in
before dawn, allowing an immediate response to light plant seeds allows seeds to avoid germination during periods
when the sun rises [83]. The importance of these anticipatory that are only temporarily favourable, and dormancy can distri-
