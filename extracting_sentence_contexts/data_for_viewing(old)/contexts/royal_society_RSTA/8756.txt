discrepancies in each case, although probably of little or no practical signiticance,
prove ultimately to be of theoretical importance as helping to justify the fundamental
equations on which they are based. The auxiliary conception of electromagnetic
momentum is not however completely attained under the most general conditions,
although it will still remain to enable us to obtain an effective mode of expressing
certain results of the simpler theory; it is probably present in no other capacity in
former interpretations of the theory so that this is hardly a disadvantage of the present
formulation.

The present theoretical relations require, of course, to be supplemented by the usual
empirical laws for the induction of the two polarisations and the conduction current.
We have however specially refrained from introducing these relations as it was desired
to emphasise the fact that the theory in its complete form is entirely independent of
these laws, so that for example it necessarily covers the most complex fields,
involving ferromagnetic inductions and polarisations. If we interpret the theory as
determining the electrodynamic changes in the system during its transition from one
configuration to another even the presence of hysteritic qualities in the inductions
will not vitiate its validity. This is, of course, no special advantage attaching
to the present form of the theory as it is in reality fundamentally inherent
in every interpretation, although it may be hidden by the particular form of
expression adopted,
