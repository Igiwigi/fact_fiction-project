In EP, we
are interested in the value assignment to effects of a measurements, independently of which
measurement the same effect appears in, e.g. the assignment of {0,1} to the effect |i)(i|,
independently of which basis |i) belongs to. In OP, we are interested in the assignment of a value
to observables, independently of which joint measurement they belong to, e.g. the assignment of
a value to P;, independently of whether it is measured together with P; or Py. The equivalence of these two perspectives is due to the fact that the KS theorem is discussed
in the context of sharp measurements. This is no longer true if the measurements we are
considering are unsharp. The discussion of unsharp measurement is necessary for the connection
of KS-type contradictions with experimental tests.
