The petioles usually appear to have been torn from their bases ; there is no
sign of a regular abscission. At the level 3, in Specimen IJ., another new leaf-base
(ab) makes its appearance between a and b. It will be seen from this specimen that
the leaves were spirally arranged; the facts agree well with a 2/5 phyllotaxis (see
diagram, p. 126). The leaf-bases were evidently adherent to the stem for a long
distance. That marked Â« can be traced with certainty for more than five inches
before it detaches itself from the stem.
