increasing trend in observed annual maximum 1-day precipitation increases confidence and
follows physical and climate model expectations (Clausius-Clapeyron); with about 18% of
moderate daily precipitation extreme events over land now attributable to warming [126].

Sub-daily precipitation extremes are less well observed in general over land [130], hence we
have lower confidence in our ability to detect changes. There has also been less work on detection
studies of 3-hour and 1-hour precipitation, including extremes. However, a growing number of
observational analyses indicate increases in the frequency and/or intensity of 1-hour extreme
precipitation in, e.g. Australia [40], parts of China [131], SE Asia [132], Europe [133,134] and
North America [28]; with [40] detecting large increases outside the range of natural variability
(up to 3xCC) for hourly extreme precipitation in Australia. A full review of this topic can be
found in [44] and this suggests that extreme sub-daily precipitation will increase at the CC rate,
or higher. This, coupled with the fact that we expect large-scale circulation changes to affect
sub-daily precipitation extremes less than thermodynamic drivers and that we have reasonable
understanding of the thermodynamic feedbacks, means that the confidence in our understanding
of the effect of climate change on extreme sub-daily precipitation is nearly as high as for daily
extreme precipitation.

Event attribution studies of extreme rainfall events have used a variety of approaches
including the statistical analysis of observational data and the analysis of large ensembles of
climate model simulations. There is no a priori reason to expect different types of intense storms
to respond in the same way to higher temperatures, and studies have so far not separated storm
types. In fact, there is substantial evidence that changes to the most intense storms may be
quite different than changes to more frequent, less intense storms of the same type [122,135,136].
The literature on the effect of climate change on tropical cyclones is rapidly expanding due to
