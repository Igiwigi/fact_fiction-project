experience nothing is truer concerning the Coal Measures than the assertion that
every lithological type, be it arenaceous, argillaceous, calcareous, or carbonaceous, is
typically inconstant and impersistent laterally. The Coal Measures are essentially
an interlocked series of lenticles, thick or thin, long or short.

There are, of course, many noteworthy exceptions which spring to the memory,
and these, perhaps, in the past have done more to mislead us in our general conception
of the Coal Measures than we are inclined to admit. But if these exceptions be
examined it will be found that they derive their value solely from the fact that they
are in reality local phenomena, and not actually widely spread. An exception may
hold good over a large coalfield. The Pennant Grit of the South Wales Coalfield is
an example. But when we take a more than local view the exceptional nature of
this phenomenon is at once established. Where is the Pennant Grit in the Forest
of Dean Coalfield,* and, conversely, what is the equivalent of the Forest of Dean Stone
in South Wales ?

We have seen (p. 404) that the occurrence of Spirorbis-limestones is no guide to the
horizon, and now Espley Grits, on the occurrence of which so much stress has been
laid in the Midland and Southern Pennine Coalfields as absolutely indicative of a
particular horizon, have failed when the test is applied more widely. Again, in
the Armorican system of coalfields in the West of England, and also in the Welsh
