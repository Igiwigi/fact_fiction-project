shows the shape of the negative terminal, to see that there is nothing improbable in
assuming that euch a deformation has taken place. If the negative terminal be
spherical, the negative glow forms a spherical envelope round ib; if it be merely a

* An exactly similar phenomenon is shown in the familiar experiment of the electric egg, where the
strie which surround the negative terminal are concave on their bright surfaces.

+ It will doubtless occur to those familiar with striated discharges, that there are considerable differences
mn the behaviour of strie and the negative glow when snbjected to the action of a magnet. It must, however,
be remembered that the positions of the strie are dependent on one another, gince each receives the dis-
charge from the one behind it. Bub in the case of the negative glow the lines of electric discharge whose
termination ib marks are fixed to the negative terminal at one end, and thus the glow can only be displaced
80 far as the deformation of these lines will permit. Tn fact, the negative glow is like @ #tria at anchor.
There is jusb the same difference between the behaviour of the two as between the effect of waves on float-
ing seaweed and seaweed that is growing on rocks. In this respect the artificial strie of which we haye
been speaking resemble the negative glow, with the exception that they have a fixed positive terminal
instead of a fixed negative terminal.
