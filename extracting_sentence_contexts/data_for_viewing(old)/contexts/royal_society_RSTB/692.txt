unfortunately biassed by the fact that no such secondary growth existed amongst living
Cryptogams—to which group he correctly determined the Lepidodendra to belong.
The existence of a secondary, exogenously-developed, vascular zone was a clear proof
in his eyes that his new plants could not be Cryptogams ; hence he referred them to
the family of Gymnosperms. and connected them with the well-known Carboniferous
plants called Sigillarie.

The conclusions thus arrived at by the great French paleontologist were almost
universally accepted at the «ime when I began my investigations into these subjects,
some thirty years ago ; I soon obtained clear proofs that many of the Carboniferous
Cryptogams, unlike their lying representatives, were provided with a secondary,
exogenously-developed, vascular zone. “That this is the case with most of Brone-
nrArt’s Lepidodendra is now an almost universally accepted fact. But these plants
vary ina very remarkable manner as to the stage of growth at which this secondary
development makes its appearance. In some, like the L. selaginoides, it exists in very
young twigs. In others, like the Arran plant (Z. Wunschianum, W11t.), the branches
have to attain to very large, even arborescent, dimensions, before the smallest.trace of
such a growth is discoverable. The LZ. Harcourtii is one of those in which no exoge-
nous zone has yet been observed ; but the history of the Arran plant teaches us to be
cautious ere we conclude that it never develops such a zone of secondary xylem.
The largest branch of LZ, Harcourtii yet met with is 34 inches in diameter, apart
from its leaves. I have specimens of the Arran plant of yet larger size, equally
devoid of all traces of secondary xylem; but when we come to stems of the latter
plant 2 feet in diameter, we find in them the most magnificent examples of a
secondary zone of wood that I have yet met with. This fact has only become
