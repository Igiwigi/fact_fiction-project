AEROFOIL THEORY. PARTS I AND II 339

The quantity of principal interest is the excess pressure on the aerofoil surface. From (27)
we see that this is given by

for points between the Mach line from O and the edge of the aerofoil. Elsewhere, on the
wing the excess pressure is as in the two-dimensional problem. All the formulae for the
velocity components are, naturally, homogeneous functions of the co-ordinates of the point
of measurement, as from the physical nature of the problem they can depend only on the
angular position relative to O. This fact is used as the basis of the cone field of Busemann
developed by Ward, to the first of whom the result (28) is originally due.

EXTENSION TO CASE OF FINITE WING

The method of extension to the case of a wing of finite span is now evident. Suppose in
figure 5 that OOâ€™ represent the projections on the xy plane of the two ends of the aerofoil
(or in the wave problem, the two ends of a finite barrier), then it is clear that the solution of
