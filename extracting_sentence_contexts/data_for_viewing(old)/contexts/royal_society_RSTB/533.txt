Briefly summarised, AtTwaTeER’s conclusions are :—

1.—That in some of his experiments with peas, half or more of the total nitrogen
of the plants was acquired from the air. Where the gains were small, or there was
a loss, the conditions were abnormal, and it is to be assumed that there was loss,
either from the nitrate of the nutritive solutions, from the seeds during germination,
or from the growing plants.

2.—An actually observed gain is positive proof that nitrogen has been assimilated,
either directly by the plants, or indirectly through the medium in which the roots
have developed. The failure of an experiment to show gain only proves non-assimila-
tion, if it is also proved that there was no liberation of nitrogen. The conflicting
results of various experimenters may probably be explained by the fact of such
liberation.

3.—The experiments do not show in what way the nitrogen is acquired. It must
have been taken up, either as free or combined nitrogen, either directly through the
foliage, or indirectly through the soil and nutritive solutions, and the roots.

4,—It is possible that the negative results of BousstnGAULtT, and ourselves, are due
to the liberation of free nitrogen. The conditions were, moreover, such as to exclude
the action of electricity and of microbes.

5.—Since Berruetor has shown that nitrogen may be fixed in organic matter by
the agency of electricity, and in soils by the agency of micro-organisms, some cases of
