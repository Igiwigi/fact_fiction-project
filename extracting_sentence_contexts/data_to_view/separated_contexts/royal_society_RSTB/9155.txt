At some point in our work, and I do not organization of the brain. A major step forward was the dis-

minus the task scans. What immediately caught my attention but not limited to the DMN, could be revealed by the
was the fact that regardless of the task under investigation, study of patterns of spatial coherence in the spontaneous
activity decreases were clearly present and almost always fluctuations (i.e. noise) of the fMRI blood-oxygen level
included the posterior cingulate and the adjacent precuneus dependent (BOLD) signal.

The first formal characterization of task-induced activity in the fMRI signal
