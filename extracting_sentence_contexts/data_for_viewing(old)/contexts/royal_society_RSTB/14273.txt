Next to the ‘play’ aspect of laughter, bonding can also
occur through the more communicative function of laughter.
Specifically, laughter in response to humour can serve as a
means of social assortment [8]. That is, interaction partners
can present ideas in a ‘humorous’ way to assess the reactions
of others, and the shared laughter indicates shared beliefs or
values. As such, shared laughter can be a marker of an
‘in-group’ affiliation.

(b) Why do people laugh?

Laughter is most commonly shown in interactions, and in
fact, much laughter comes from the speaker in reaction to
their own comment [1]. When laughing in response to an
external event, people generally report that they laugh
because what happened was funny or humorous [1]. But
what are the reasons that explain why people find something
funny? Why, for instance, do we think it is funny when a
mouse chases a cat? The most likely answer to this question
is that we perceive this behaviour as incongruent to our
expectations and this perceived incongruity results in feelings
of amusement and hence laughter [9]. A simple violation,
however, may not be enough to evoke feelings of funniness.
The observed event must be at least of moderate intensity
to be funny (yet too intense norm violations may be also
