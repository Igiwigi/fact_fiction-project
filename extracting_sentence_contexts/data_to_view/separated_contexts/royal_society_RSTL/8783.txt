To make the experiment in queſtion, it is neceſ{-
{ary that bodies ſhould be ſupported by glaſs, filk,
or reſin, without touching any thing elſe commu-
nicating with what we now call non-eleQrics ; with-
out which, the figns of eleqricity, which are ſought
for, cannot manifeſt themſelves. To this experiment, therefore, a previous know-
lege is required, of inſulating bodies to be.elecriſed;
but where is the man who was acquainted with this
fact thirty years ago? Before that period, it was not
even gueſſed at by any one. Since Mr. Gray diſcovered, that bodies muſt be in-
ſulated, to communicate to them a perceptible eleQric
virtue, to what purpoſe could we ſet up iron bars
under a ſtormy cloud?
