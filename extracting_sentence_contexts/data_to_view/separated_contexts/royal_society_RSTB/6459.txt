In Ceroplatus, the tracheal system is well developed but functional spiracles are absent. The body of this larva is elongated and provided with four protrusible anal lobes,
the skin is thrown into numerous folds which increase its surface, the integument is
thin and richly supplied with a sub-cuticular net of tracheoles and the larva lives
under a hygroscopic tent of saliva. These facts seem to indicate that the conditions
for cutaneous respiration are specially favourable. BIOLOGY AND MORPHOLOGY OF THE MYCETOPHILIDAE 103

In Diadocidia and Speolepta, the conditions for cutaneous respiration are also
favourable, the larvae being slender, elongated, and provided with anal lobes. The
integument also is thin and the larvae live in slimy hygroscopic tubes.
