1. BEING desirous of obtaining an accurate copy of the English Imperial Standard
Troy Pound, for an intended comparison of our weights therewith, I applied to the
late Captain KaTer, and he had the goodness to procure for me not only a copy
made by Mr. Bars, exactly similar to those described in his paper *, but also a
balance of Mr. Ropinson, of the same dimension and construction as that used by
himself in comparing the legal standard in the custody of the Clerk of the House of
Commons. The copy of the Troy pound is of the same kind of brass as that used by
Mr. Bare for the other copies sent by Captain KaTzr to different towns in Great
Britain, It bears the stamp © TY P49 1824” ; the same stamp, in fact, that was upon
the pound No. 2.4 which Captain Karzr sent to Edinburgh. I shall designate this
pound by the letter K. I received it, March 12, 1827, from the late Dr. Youxs. He
had noted upon the cover of the box, © Imperial Troy pound: found by Captain
* KarTxR to exceed the standard a very little, not more than 006 grain.”
