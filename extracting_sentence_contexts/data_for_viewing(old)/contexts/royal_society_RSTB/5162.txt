‘The apparently normal plating in the Clypeastrina (Table 2a), occurring in five genera
out of a total of seven, differs from that found both in the regular urchins and in the
majority of the Atelostomata Sternata. Here area 1, as well as area 3, is reversed, and
this results in a perfectly bilateral symmetry. Thus perfect bilateral symmetry of the
inter-ambulacra may result from the reversion of the plating in either area 1 or area 4.

Lovén sometimes indicates the presence of more than one compound plate—e.g., in
Palcotropus josephine (Lovin, 1874, Plate XXXII, fig. 197) there is a single plate next
the unpaired (peristomial) plate in area 1 which he regards as plates 2b, 2a and 3a united.
In areas 2 and 3, as well as in area 4, there is a similar single plate next the peristomial
one. This he regards as plates 2a and 2b united together. It may be doubted whether
so much complete fusion of plates would have occurred during development. This form
is primitive in spite of the fact that it possesses a sub-anal fasciole (Lovin, 1874,
Plate XIII, figs. 108, 110, 111). It may be that no fusion of the plates takes place,
but that plate 2b displaces plate 2a (i.e., separates it entirely from the peristomial plate)
in areas 1, 2 and 4, while plate 2a displaces plate 2b in area 3. In Ananchytes sulcata,
for example, plate 2b has separated plate 2a from the unpaired plate in area 4, and the
same is true for area 1 if no fusion of plates 2a and 2b (as indicated by Lovin, 1874,
Plate XXIV, fig. 181) has occurred. In Desoria australia (Lovin, 1874, Plate XXVIII,
fig. 187) plate 2b of area 4 has been separated from the unpaired plate by 2a. Still,
plate 2a is larger than plate 2b, and must have appeared after 2b, for in the case of the
