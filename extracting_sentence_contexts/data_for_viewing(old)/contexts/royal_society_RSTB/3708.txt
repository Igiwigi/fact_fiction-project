arising right and left of the paraphysial opening, as shown in text-fig. 2, but, from
the first, their attachments extend a little in front of the paraphysial opening, where
they may appear in a longitudinal vertical section which is not strictly median.

It is perfectly clear that the paraphysis and the lateral choroid plexuses are parts
of one and the same system of folds, the former being formed by evagination and the

latter by invagination of the thin roof of the prosencephalon (lamina supra-
neuroporica), between and above the foramina of Monro, and just in front of the
commissura aberrans (text-figs. 1 and 2). The fact that, as I shall show later on, the

paraphysis is supplied mainly by branches of the anterior choroidal arteries, affords a
further justification for regarding it morphologically as part of the system of choroid
plexuses.

I have already (Denpy, 1899, b)* figured these structures in a series of
transverse sections of Stage R, but their relations are better shown in a similar
series of sections of Embryo 162 (also Stage R), prepared by Prof. Howxs and
Dr. SwinNerton, some of which are represented in text-figs. 4-11. Text-fig. 5
