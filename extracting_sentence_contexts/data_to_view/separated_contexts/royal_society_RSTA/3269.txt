ON COLOURS IN METAL GLASSES, ETC. 281

colour, which was frequently resolvable into a mixture of green and amethystine
striz. These colours would be shown by an amorphous or granular film for which
the density was in parts as low as 1 = ‘7. Moreover, such a structure agrees with the
fact that “the films did not sensibly conduct electricity” and that ‘the films cannot
be regarded as continuous.” * Farapay further states} that, though they are certainly
porous to gas and to water-vapour, the films have evident optical continuity. Heating diminished the conducting power and changed the colour to amethyst or
ruby, just as with Brrzy’s films, pressure, which we should expect to increase the
density of the film, changed the transmitted colour to green and increased the
reflecting power; and these are precisely the changes which would, according to
calculation, accompany an increase in » to the neighbourhood of unity in the case of
an amorphous or granular film.
