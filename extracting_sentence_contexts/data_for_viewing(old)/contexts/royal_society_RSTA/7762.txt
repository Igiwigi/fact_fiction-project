In particular, on magnetically disturbed days we do not get echoes from Region F
on 4 Mc./sec. This is the reason for the few observations shown at the end of March
and in April. On days following those of “‘ no echoes ”’ the time of commencement
of reflexion from Region F, in the morning seems to be delayed. This accounts
for the points which lie above the curve in March. There was usually a break in
the (P’, ¢) recording from about 20.00-24.00 hours, the result of which is apparent in
the graph. In summer, Region F, echoes were generally observed throughout the
night at Troms6. On other nights nocturnal Region E appeared to prevent radio
signals reaching Region F,. These curves are not symmetrical about noon, which
illustrates the fact that Region F, critical frequency does not vary according to the
