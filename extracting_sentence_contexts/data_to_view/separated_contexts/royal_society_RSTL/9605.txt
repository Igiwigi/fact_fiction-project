80 far as externals are concerned, the fine Lycopodium ulicifolium recently imported
from Khasia Hills in northern India in a living state, only requires to be raised upon
an arborescent stem to furnish an exact copy of the ancient Lepidodendra. Its thick,
succulent, dependent branches, devoid of all adventitious roots ; its oblong, flat,
spirally-arranged leaflets, which leave, when they fall, a distinet Lepidodendroid
cicatrix ; and its huge, often dichotomous, strobili, usually six inches in length, remind
us most vividly of the dependent branches of the Palzozoic Lycopods. The successive developments of the various vegetable elementary tissues is not
unimportant.
