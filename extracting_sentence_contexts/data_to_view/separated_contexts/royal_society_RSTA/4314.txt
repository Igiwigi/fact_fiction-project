Unless we understand how the program works, the statement gives us a false impression
that we understand something when we do not ... . One reason why we find it so hard to
understand the development of form may be that we do not make machines that develop:
often we understand biological phenomena only when we have invented machines with
similar properties ... and we do not make ‘embryo’ machines. In fact, ‘understanding’ something means explaining it with a model that we are familiar with,
and a machine gives us an immediate sense of familiarity. When we see it working before our
eyes, we feel that we ‘know’ it. Actually, we do not even need to build a machine to get this
feeling.
