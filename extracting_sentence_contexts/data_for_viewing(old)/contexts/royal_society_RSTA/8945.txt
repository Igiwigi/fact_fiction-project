purpose is the great variability with change in the conditions of excitation. This is
very clearly indicated by a comparison of intensities of corresponding lines as observed
by L., D. and B. The following are a few examples out of a large number illustrating
this. The numbers following a wave-length give the intensities as estimated
respectively by BAty and by Liverne and Dewar :—

As between the two spectra also, a fact noticed by L. and D. is of importance.
They say “there is one very remarkable change in the xenon spectrum produced by
the introduction of a jar into the cireuit. Without the jar the xenon gives two.
bright green rays at about 4917 and 24924, but on putting a jar into the circuit
they are replaced by a single, still stronger, line at about 4922. In no other case
have we noticed a change so striking.” They also state that changes occur with the
same kind of discharge as between different tubes. These are clear cases of oun
displacements. Pavu1son again (Joc. cit.) gives some constant separations in the first
spectrum. The triplet separations observed are about », = 1778, »,= 814, in due
order of magnitude with those for Kr. No line suitable for S (1) comes within the
observed region, but there are two lines with W.N. 40375740, 39561°50 separated by
813°99, which would serve for 8,(1) and §,(1) and are in a similar position to the
KrS lines. They clearly suggest that the §,(1) line is at —42153°39, using
