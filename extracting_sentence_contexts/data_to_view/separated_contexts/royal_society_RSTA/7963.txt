The attachment of the crystal to the fibre, so as to make any specific direction in the
crystal vertical, was a matter of some difficulty, and had to be adjusted by repeated
trials. A short focal length telescope fitted with a graduated eye-piece scale, which
could be rotated through any known angle about the axis of the telescope tube, served
for measurements in connection with the mounting of the crystal. In fact, with the
help of the torsion-head for measuring rotations about a vertical axis, the graduated
circle of the telescope for rotations about a horizontal axis, and the eye-piece scale
for linear displacements, all the necessary adjustments and measurements on the
crystal could easily be made.

3. Results. Before proceeding to describe the experimental results, we explain the notation
adopted in the paper.
