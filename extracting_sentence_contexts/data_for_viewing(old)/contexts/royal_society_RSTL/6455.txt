than in Bread. Tn the Fat Calf and Fat Ox, however, it is lower, namely, only 2:49 tg
1 in the former, and 5-78 to 1 in the latter. On the other hand, in the Carcass of the
Fat Lamb, the proportion of the starch-equivalent”” is 8:49, in that of the Fat P
9-89, in that of the Fat Pig 11-77, and in that of the Extra-fat Sheep 15:18 to 1 of the
nitrogenous matters. The average of the 6 matured Carcasses gives 893, and that of
those of the 10 animals analysed 7:11 of non-nitrogenous matter, reckoned as * starch-
equivalent,” to 1 of nitrogenous substance—that is, rather more than in Bread.

Of the fact of the increase in the proportion (80 far as its respiratory and fat-forming
capacity is concerned) of the non-nitrogenous to the nitrogenous matter of our food, by
the use of these Animal aliments, the evidence adduced can hardly leave a doubt. Tt
will perhaps be maintained, that when animals are 8 far fattened as to attain the regult
here 8upposed, the feeder is simply inducing disease in the animals themselyes, and
frustrating that which it is considered should be the special advantage of a meat-diet—
namely, the increase in the relative supply of the nitrogenous constituents in our food,
It is not denied, that occasionally animals are oyer-fed, and that a condition bordering on
disease is 80 induced. But such is certainly not the rule. 'There can, indeed, be little
doubt, that in animals that would be admitted, by both producer and consumer, to be in
only a proper condition of fatness, there would be a higher relation of respiratory and
fat-forming capacity, 80 to speak, in their total consumed portions, than in the average
of our staple Vegetable foods. It may be true, that with the modern system of bringing
