The name sacro-caudal, applied to the first three caudal vertebree by Mivarr,
although convenient in some respects, is hardly necessary. If, in the designation
of the vertebrae, the fact of their union in the syn-sacrum is to be expressed, the
last three thoracic should be called thoracico-sacral, and all the lumbar, lumbo-sacral. As already stated, I propose to retain the name lumbo-sacral for the 29th-32nd
vertebrae, not to intimate their union in the sacrum, but to express the fact that
they are vertebra of a special character, coming between undoubted lumbar and
probable sacral vertebrae. The 39th or fourth caudal is the first free vertebra of the caudal series. It is
considerably smaller than its predecessors, and its neural spine is so short as to be
practically obsolete.
