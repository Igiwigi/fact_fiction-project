In the above, a prime denotes differentiation with respect to u and a dot differentiation with
respect to s. For the boundary conditions, we have used the facts that in the three-dimensional
set-up dJ” is parallel to ez, that its co-normal is given by vp = (+%(+¢), 0, +2(+0)), and that y(v) :=
§(41 + x1(41), 0).

It is informative to compare equations (3.2) to other models for two-dimensional capillary
origami, which typically assume inextensible plates, in situations where strong contact line
pinning is expected. Specifically, such models read [11,23]
