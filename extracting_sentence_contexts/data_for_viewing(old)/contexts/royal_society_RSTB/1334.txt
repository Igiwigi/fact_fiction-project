Structure of the Nucleus.â€”In a section through the nucleus, which has been
stained in piero-carmine, and in hematoxylin (fig. 14) or methylene blue, so as to

give a contrast in colour between the nucleus and the surrounding protoplasm, the
outline of the nucleus is generally sharp for the greater part of the periphery. It is

unfrequently the case however, that there are regions where the sharpness of the
tion is lost. This appearance I believe to be due to the fact that the plane of
e section here cuts the nucleus obliquely.
Although, as F. E. Scuvuze states, the nucleus often appears to be surrounded by
definite membrane when seen in the whole specimen, and in sections has a well-
ed limit (figs. 14 and 16), I have failed, in examining sections, to see a clear
dication of a nuclear wall which is distinct from the protoplasm on the one hand,
d the contents of the nucleus on the other.
