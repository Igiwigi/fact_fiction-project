It is not therefore suwrprising that the glacier should have been
regarded as an ice-river by those who dwelt in its vicinity, or that this notion
8hould haye found a place in the speculations of writers upon the subject. The state-
ments of M. RExÞVU in connexion with this point are particularly distinet ;—* There are,”
he writes, © a multitude of facts which scem to necessitate the belief that the substance
of glaciers enjoys a kind of ductility which permits it to model itself on the locality
which it occupies, to become thin and narrow, and to elongate itself like a soft paste *,'
But this obseryer put forward his speculations with great caution, and often in the
form of questions which he confessed his inability to answer. © M. Rgxpu,” says Pro-

fessor ForBrs, © has the candour not to treat his ingenious speculations as leading to
any certain result, not being founded on experiments worthy of confidence...... My if
theory of glacial motion, then, is this :—A GLACIER 18 AN IMPERFECT FLUID OR VISCOUS _
BODY, WHICH 18 URGED DOWN SLOPES OF A CERTAIN INCLINATION BY THE MUTUAL PRESSURE
OF ITS PARTS.”
«The sort of consistency to which we refer,” proceeds Professor Forres, * may be
illustrated by that of moderately thick mortar, or the contents of a tar-barrel poured
into a sloping channel.” Treacle and honey are also referred to as illustrative of the
consistency of a glacier. 'The author of the theory endeavours, with much ability, to
show that the notion of semifluidity, as applied to ice, is not an absurdity, but on the
contrary, that the motion of a glacier exactly resembles that of a viscous body.
