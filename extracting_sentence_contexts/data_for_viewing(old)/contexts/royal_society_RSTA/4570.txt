steam power in the industrial revolution, ‘for the first time in history goods could be produced
in abundance for all mankind’ [27, p. iv]. But as physical power flowed, so did political power, as
steam concentrated wealth, and thus political influence, in the captains of industry who managed
successfully to exploit it.

Moreover, as the nineteenth century gave way to the twentieth, steam was still almost entirely
a technology of industry: almost no one had steam power in their homes. Electricity offered the
prospect of energy available to all on equal terms. Electricity was modern, it was good, and it was
democratic. Perhaps for this reason, Americans in the early-twentieth century were proud of the
fact that the USA used as much electrical energy as ‘all the rest of the world combined’ [26, p. 339].
If using power was good, then using more power was better.

But not all Americans were using it equally. In fact, some were not using it at all. Electricity
generation in the USA was mostly the work of entrepreneurs such as Thomas Edison and
George Westinghouse (who manufactured generators and other necessary equipment in for-profit
enterprises) and private utilities that used that equipment to produce and sell electricity as a


commodity. This model proved highly successful in urban areas, but rural areas were another
matter [26-28]. By the early 1930s, most urban Americans had access to electricity, but most rural
Americans did not.

Electricity had been heavily marketed and promoted by private utilities for its capacity to
save labour, but the rural Americans who (it was argued) laboured longest and hardest had
seen little electricity reach their homes. By the 1920s, there were some municipal utilities, as well
