The first of these is obvious, and the last follows from the second. The fact that [p,r] =0 can be
found by explicit calculation, but also understood as a consequence of the fact that, in momentum
space, r is the dilation operator divided by |p|, while p is invariant under dilations (its norm
stays one).

Together, equations (3.8) and (3.9) thus obey equation (2.11). The best way to describe these 6 |
observables physically is to say that they represent a sheet moving with the speed of light in one
of the two possible orthogonal directions. “a
This is why we claim that the ontological theory behind a ‘neutrino’ is an infinite sheet moving 1B
with velocity v =c in one of its two possible orthogonal directions. If interactions or masses would :<
