XLv1. Matters relating to Refraction. The refractions contained in this account, like those in our
former Papers, tend to prove, that when rays of light pass hori-
- zontally, and considerably distant from the surface of the earth,
they are less bent or refracted from their rectilinear courses,
than theory and opinion have laid down as fact. It is very cer-
tain, however, that objection lies against particular conclusions
drawn from such data as we' possess ; because the angles of
elevation and depression of corresponding stations are observed
at different times, and almost always, therefore, under different
circumstances ; but, with the-experience and continual practice
of thus obtaining means of computing these refractions, although
we may not be able to determine the refracting power. of the
air under given circumstances, yet,. as the causes which render

When the instrument formerly made use of by General Roy

mining, in'a more accurate manner than had yet been done;

Â® As many instances of strong atmospherical refraction have been related, and inge-
niously accounted for, in some of the late publications of the Royal Society, I think it
right to mention, by way of note, a very extraordinary instance of its variability. In the month of June, 1795, when the instrument and party were stationed at
Pilsden Hill, in Dorsetshire, on a particular day, at about the hour of four, T em
ployed myself in observing the angles of depression or elevation of the surrounding
hills.
