The structure of the islets, as seen under a high power, is different in the rabbit
from that seen in the cat and dog. The islets in the rabbit stand out less clearly
from the surrounding alveolar tissue than those of the cat and dog. This is due
to the fact that the islet-cells in the rabbit stain fairly well with toluidene-blue,
and better with eosin. The result is a pinkish-purple tint of all the islet-cells. The same is true of the ductule epithelium of the rabbit.
