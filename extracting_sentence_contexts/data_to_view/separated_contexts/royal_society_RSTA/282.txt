energy of incident electron (eV)

Ficure 2. Variation, with electron energy, of the attachment coefficient for electrons in atomic
oxygen on the assumption of two different values of the polarizability parameter p. A, p = 5-7 a.u.;
B, p = 18-3 a.u.

where L, = 1, S, = }. In this formula allowance has been made for the fact that the integral
vanishes unless S, = S,, M,, = My, and the effects of the core and outer electrons have been
separated. For absorption in which the O atom is left in a state of the normal 3P term, the final
term of the complete system O('P), +e(#s) in an orbital of the continuum, is either 2P or #P.
As there is a vanishing probability ofa transition to the latter term we obtain Qy(O- 2P-> O 3P)

Similarly, for absorption in which the O atom is left in
a level of the 'D or 'S terms the final terms of the complete system must be *D or ?S respec-
tively. The corresponding cross-sections are therefore obtained by taking L,= 2, $=}
and L, = 0, S, = 4 respectively in (15).
