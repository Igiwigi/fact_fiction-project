include Mg(BHg4)2 and MgZr4(PO4)¢, which feature relatively modest conductivities of 10-9
to 10-7Scm™|, respectively, even at greater than 100°C. Notably, the best Mg?* ion solid
conductor is in fact a MOF, Mg2(dobpdc), impregnated with Mg(OPhCF3)2 (~OPhCF3 = 4-
trifluoromethylphenolate) and Mg(TFSI)2 (TFSI~ =bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide) [22]. This material features a Mg?* conductivity of 10-4 S cm™! at 25°C and will be discussed in greater
detail below. Demonstrating the highest Mg”+ ion conductivity among solids notwithstanding, MOFs and
COFs possess an arsenal of additional properties that identify them as attractive candidates for
solid-state electrolytes [23-27] (figure 1).
