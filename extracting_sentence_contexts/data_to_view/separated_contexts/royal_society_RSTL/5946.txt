It was by means of the simple diagram here sketched
that Mr. Horkxixs showed why the marginal creyasses of a glacier are inclined towards
Sits source*. This fact, therefore, 80 far as it goes, is also opposed to the idea of
BZ viscosity.
£2 But it is known that in the case of a substance confessedly viscous, a sudden shock or
strain may produce fracture. Professor FokBrs justly urges, © that sealing wax at mode-
Arate atmospheric temperatures, will mould itself (with time) to the most delicate inequal-
ties of the surface on which it rests . . . . . but may, at the same time, be shivered to
atoms by a blow with a hammerÞ.” Hence, in order to estimate the weight of the
objection, that the glacier breaks when subjected to strain, we must know the conditions
under which the force is applied. The fifteenth station on the line (EF!) at Trelaporte stands on the lateral moraine of the
I glacier; between it and the fourteenth, a distance of 300 links, or 190 feet, intervenes.
and within this distance the glacier suffers its maximum strain.
