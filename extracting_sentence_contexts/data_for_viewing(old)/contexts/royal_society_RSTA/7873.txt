TIME-LAG IN A CONTROL SYSTEM 439

good control ; v, is fairly large. In this case the control function builds up more
rapidly and further than in previous examples, consequently the rapidity of initial
return to normality is higher. There is some “ over-shooting ”’ ; in fact, comparison
of figs. 9 (II) (broken) and 10 (II) well illustrates the choice to be decided upon as
mentioned at the beginning of this section. Neither of these cases, however, will be
so flexible as that for which the results are shown by the full curves in fig. 9.

In examples where v, # (), it may be noticed that any discontinuity in (7) is
repeated (to a smaller degree since v; < 1) at regular intervals of one time-lag after
its first occurrence.

Case (it). #0, %4, v2, ¥3 # O—No general examination of this case has been
made; a few cases have been tried for » = 0-3 merely because this value
corresponded to a definite practical problem.
