when þ(#z)=e—*, for [/a%e—"dau is infinite when n= vr < —1, 80 that we do not obtain
by means of the formula a demonstration of the equation (8). If however we replace

ſox%=de by p("3*) in all the terms, whether the integral be really infinite or not,

we do in fact, as we should expect, obtain (8). For, putting þ(z)=e—*, substituting
gamma-functions for the integrals, and writing n—1 in place of n, the formula gives
