Water appeared to take up eight or ten times its
volume ; but the experiment was made over mercury, which
might occasion an error, though it did not seem to act on the
fluid. The water became of a tint approaching to orange. When the explosive gas was detonated with hydrogene,
equal to twice its volume, there was a great absorption, to
more than +, and solution of muriatic acid was formed ; when
the explosive gas was in excess, oxygene was always ex-
pelled, a fact demonstrating the stronger attraction of hydro-
gene for oxymuriatic gas than for oxygene. I have said that mercury has no action upon this gas in
its purest form at common temperatures. Copper and anti-
