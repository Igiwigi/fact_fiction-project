percentage of variance explained by the q largest variance PCs, which were used to build the
marker matrices G and H.

Figure 2 gives the biplot for the correlation matrix PCA of the fossil teeth data of ยง2b. The
variable markers are displayed as arrows and the tooth markers as numbers. The group of three


nearly horizontal and very tightly knit variable markers for two width variables and one height 8 |
variable, WIDTH, HTMDT and TRIWIDTH, suggests a group of highly correlated variables, which

are also strongly correlated with the first PC (represented by the horizontal axis). The very high 3
proportion of variability explained by the two-dimensional principal subspace provides solid : s
grounds for these conclusions. In fact, the smallest of the three true coefficients of correlation <

between these three variables is 0.944 (HTMDT and TRIWIDTH), and the smallest magnitude
correlation between PC1 and any of these variables is 0.960 (TRIWIDTH). The sign difference
in PC2 loadings between the three length variables (towards the bottom left of the plot) and
the other variables is clearly visible. Projecting the marker for individual 58 onto the positive
directions of all variable markers suggests that fossil tooth 58 (on the left of the biplot) is a large
tooth. Inspection of the data matrix confirms that it is the largest individual on six of the nine
variables, and close to largest on the remaining three. Likewise, individuals 85-88 (on the right)
are small-sized teeth. Individuals whose markers are close to the origin have values close to the =
mean for all variables. :
