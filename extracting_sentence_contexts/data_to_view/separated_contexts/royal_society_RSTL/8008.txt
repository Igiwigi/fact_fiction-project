J. CASEY ON OYCLIDES AND SPHERO-QUARTICS. 685

to any plane'L related to the quadric will correspond a pair of inverse points having a
correlatiye reference to the cyclide, and these inverse points will be the limiting points
of the sphere U (the Jacobian of &, B, y, 3) and the plane L.

258. We have determined in art. 5 the condition that the sphere a«+yB+zy +w3
should be a generating sphere of W to be given by the determinant (7), and that this
determinant in tetrahedral coordinates is the equation of the focal quadric F of W,
Now since for any system of values of &, y, 2, w which satisfies the determinant (7) we
get a point on F, we ee that to any point on F will correspond a generating sphere of
W, and generally to any point P having any special relation to F will correspond a sphere
Q having a similar relation to W ; in fact the sphere Q will have the point P for centre,
and will be orthogonal to U.

259. Since the tetrahedral coordinates of the centre of web B+:2y+v8 are
@; Yi, 214 Wi, and if four spheres orthogonal to U pass through the same pair of inverse
points, with respect to U we know that their centres are complanar. Hence we have
the following theorem :—

The condition that the four spheres
