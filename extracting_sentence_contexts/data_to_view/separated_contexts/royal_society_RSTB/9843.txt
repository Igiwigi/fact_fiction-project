Pierre
Macquer’s Dictionnaire de la Chymie (1766) lamented the
persistence of Aristotelian chemistry. In his Philosophical
Inquiry into the Cause of Animal Heat (1778), Dr Patrick
Dugud Leslie resolved the ‘chymical analysis’ of living
matter into water, earth, air and phlogiston—the latest fire
surrogate [2,22]. In fact, the Enlightenment was full of residual fires. Earth

ad its central fire, the solar system its solar fire, the heavens
the celestial fire of the stars, comets and quintessential aether. Electrical fire discharged as lightning.
