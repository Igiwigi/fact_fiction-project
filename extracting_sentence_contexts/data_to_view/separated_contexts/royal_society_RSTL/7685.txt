Nodal curve. The equation shows that the line y=0, z—2=0 (reciprocal of the
line W=0, X+Z=0) is a nodal line on the surface. It als shows that the line y=0, w=0 (reciprocal of the edge) is a tacnodal line

=2 nodal lines) on the surface; in fact attending only to the lowest terms in y, w, we
have
—a716(z—2Yuw*+8(v+2)wp*+3y]=0,

that is,

4(v— w+IEE HS =0;

two values, w=Ay?, w=By?, which indicates a tacnodal line. The nodal curve is thus made up of the line y=0, z»—z=0 once, and the line y=0,
w=0 twice; U=8.
