the earth to cause brush discharges. Consequently we always examined some plate
or other in the dark to see if this did occur, If it does, of course, the result is that
we get too low readings and a too low value of K. On the other hand, the nearer
the top of the sulphur plate is to the suspended plate the better, for the greater the
forces to be observed. The “art” of the experiment, we should say, lies in adjusting
the voltage till brushing just does not occur. This is also provided for by placing the
coil terminals so near together that a discharge occurs there before it occurs between
the sulphur and the earthed part of the apparatus. It is also exceedingly necessary
to remove all dust and sulphur crumbs between each set of weighings.

On thinking the matter over in the light of our present experience, we have an
idea that there might be advantages in using a liquid of high electric strength instead
of air—in fact, to proceed as QuincKE did in determining the dielectric constants of
liquids by weighing, in order to get the advantage of the large forces he was able to
measure.

Analyses of the sulphur plates were made by breaking them up, and taking samples
from the active part. This was also necessary in order to find out whether there were
any cavities in the plates. In only one plate was a cavity discovered, but happily it
was under the guard-ring almost entirely, and was very insignificant.
