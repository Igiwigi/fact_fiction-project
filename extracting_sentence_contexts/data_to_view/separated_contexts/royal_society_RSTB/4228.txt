It is impossible to
measure the diameter of the eggs when in the contracted state on account of the
irregular outline of the egg surface, but all measurements of eggs which have
resumed their spherical condition have failed to show any diminution of volume
after fertilisation. It is possible that the loss of this contraction or compression of
the egg after fertilisation may account for the slight fall in the conductivity which is
sometimes observed between 3 and 10 minutes after fertilisation. That the decrease in the resistance of the eggs after fertilisation is not due toa
decrease in their volume is apparent from the following facts :â€”

(a) Microscopical measurements failed to reveal any decrease in the size of
Echinus eggs after fertilisation. This result was also arrived at independently by
Loxs, McLenvon (38), and CHEvRETON and Vues (6), for the eggs of other species. (b)
