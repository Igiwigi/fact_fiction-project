The lyophilic colloids used for this work show both effects, the second in an
eminent degree. Throughout the mass of an apparently homogeneous crystal the
colloid may be present to the extent of about 4% and if the crystal growth
has been allowed to become complex there may be 10% or even more. Previous work has not as a rule dealt very fully with the amount of absorption into
the crystal, and in fact the amount seems in all but a few cases to have been very
small. These peculiarities are exhibited by the slightly soluble salts of lead, such as the
chloride and bromide. Lead azide displays more especially a variety of changes in
crystalline habit.
