Figure 4. (a) A simple model system composed of reactant, bridge and product potential-energy surfaces. The vibrational
energy levels of each PES are given by thin horizontal lines. The instanton is shown by a thick horizontal line at the optimal
tunnelling energy. (6) A schematic illustrating the instanton for an arbitrary set of PESs. The trajectories are shown with bold
lines and the PESs with dashed lines, in each case with the colour corresponding to the diabatic state. The label below a trajectory
denotes the imaginary time for travelling along it. The hopping points xp, Xp, X¢ and x)’ are shown as black dots and labelled
above the corresponding point. (Online version in colour.)

bottom of the reactant well, the theory does not neglect the effect of ZPE, which is instead dealt
with in the prefactor terms. In fact, the same thing happens in the Born—-Oppenheimer case, for
which it is possible to prove that the low-temperature limit of instanton theory is asymptotic to
the WKB rate of tunnelling out of the lowest vibrational level [97]. Because of this the instanton
results are in good agreement with the quantum calculations in the deep-tunnelling regime and
correctly recover the classical limit at high temperatures.

4. Fourth-order instanton theory

We consider a system that consists of three potentials corresponding to a reactant |R), bridge |B)
and product |P), arranged as shown in figure 4a. In particular, we exclusively consider the case
for which the reaction is in the normal regime and the minimum of the bridge is higher in energy
than both the reactant and product minima, but at the point where the reactant and product
cross (with energy Vrp = Vp(x) = Vp(x)), the bridge PES is lowest. We assume that |R) and |P) are
