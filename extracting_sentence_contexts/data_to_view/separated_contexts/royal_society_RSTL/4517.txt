We &$hall now consider what may be called the converse of this phenomenon, that is
to say, the development of nervous force under the influence of the electric current,
which development is produced exactly according to the same law as that of elec-
tricity by nervous force. This influence of electricity on nervous force is manifested
in the muscular fibre: we have already observed at the beginning of this memoir
that the phenomena presented by the organ of electrical fishes, as well as those of the
muscular fibre, together with the modifications of these phenomena under various
circumstances, invariably followed the same course, and preserved the strictest ana-
logy with each other, so that what was true with regard to the electrical discharge of
the torpedo, was equally s0 with regard to muscular contraction. This fact admitted, we proceed to the experiments. Expose in a living dog, rabbit or frog, the muscles of the thighs, removing entirely
the skin and membranes, then transmit through the musecles the electric current

from an ordinary pile of from 30 to 40 elements, applying one of the poles to the
upper, and the other to the lower part of the thigh, Tf the positive pole is placed
above and the negative below, the current traverses the muscle in the same direction
as the ramification of the nerves ; the contrary is the case if the position of the poles
be reversed.
