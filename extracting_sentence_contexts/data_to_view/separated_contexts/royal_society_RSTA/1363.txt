These include the quadric surface, the ruled cubic surface, and some of the quartic
surfaces of intersection of two quadrics. We set out now to show that given any possible ®-surface F, we can find all H-systems
of quadrics ® in which F is a general ®-surface. Let F, in fact, be the partial or complete intersection of two quadrics Q;, Q. It will
clearly be sufficient, then, if we find all H-systems of quadrics which contain Q,, Qe,
and in which, also, F is a general ®-surface ; and this we now proceed to do. The first step is to determine a certain system of quadrics ®,, where ©, is defined
as the most general linear system of quadrics, which contains Q,, Qe, and in which the
general variable surface of intersection is of the same type as ¥. Now there are only three
kinds of restriction that we can impose on a linear system of quadrics, which will affect
the type of the general surface of intersection and yet leave the system linear and of
freedom 7 => 4.
