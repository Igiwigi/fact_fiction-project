of the force. The boundary conditions in this theory are of the standard form,
namely continuity of the tangential components of electric and magnetic force, and
of the normal components of magnetic induction and total current. It has been
shown by Basser how the whole scheme may be formulated from a single energy
function by the principle of Least Action.

3. In the present paper it is proposed to take the fundamental equations of this
type of theory in a general form on the lines of Mr. Larmor’s recent papers on
Electrodynamics, and to develop them so as to obtain the solutions of the problems
of the reflection of light at the surface of a magnet, and of the transmission of light
through normally magnetised metallic films. ‘The formule so obtained will be
compared with the available experimental results, with a view to ascertaining to
what extent the theory is in agreement with the facts. The theory involves a single
magneto-optic constant which in metals may be assumed complex; we shall try
whether it is possible, by giving suitable numerical values to the modulus and vector
angle of this constant, to make the theory account for all the observed phenomena ;
and if so, we shall ascertain what these numerical values are. If successful we shall
thus have a formulation of the phenomena in a mathematical scheme, which ought to
serve as a guide in the elaboration of physical theory.

In carrying out this programme, I am aware that I shall be going over ground
which has already been covered to some extent by GoLpDHAMMER, and also by Drups,
but my method will be eutirely different from theirs, and I shall be able to use
important experimental results which had not been published at the time their papers
were written.
