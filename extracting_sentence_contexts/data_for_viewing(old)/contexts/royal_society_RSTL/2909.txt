M. Davssy having ascertained that at Brest the ocean rises when the barometer
is depressed, I verified the existence of the same fact at Liverpool and London, and
I found that at Liverpool when the barometer falls :91 inch the tide rises 10-1 inches.
As the range of the barometer is 3 inchesZ, the correction which arises from change
in the atmospheric pressure is by no means inconsiderable, its range being at Liver-
pool about 33 inches. At London I have found that when the barometer falls '9 inch

{ Between the tropics the fluctuations of the barometer do not much exceed one fourth of an inch, while
beyond this space they reach to 3 inches. DaxtzrLL's Meteorological Essays, p. 108.
