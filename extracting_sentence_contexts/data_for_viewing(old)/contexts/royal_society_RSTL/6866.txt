164 DR. PAVY ON THE IMMUNITY ENJOYED BY THE STOMACH

an exceedingly important one it must be admitted by all to be), still remains open for
solution, Why does the stomach, composed as it is of digestible materials, escape being
digested itself, whilst digestion is being carried on in its interior? It is evident, whatever
explanation, with any pretence to sufficiency, is given, must comprise 80me broad prin-
ciple of action capable of providing against all contingenciesâ€”capable of affording, in
fact, that uninterrupted security during life which upon looking around us we observe
the stomach to enjoy.

The view that I have to offer refers the immunity observed to the circulation within
the walls of the organ of an alkaline current; and this agrees with the principle I have
laid down as indispensable, for the circulation of blood forms with us an essential
condition of life. It will not be disputed, that the presence of acidity is one of the
necessary circumstances for the accomplishment of gastric digestion. Now, alkalinity is a
constavt, character of the blood, and as during life the walls of the stomach are every-
where permeated by a current of this alkaline blood, we have here an opposing influence,
the effect of which would be to destroy, by neutralizing its acidity, the solvent properties
of the digestive fluid tending to penetrate and act upon the texture of the organ.
