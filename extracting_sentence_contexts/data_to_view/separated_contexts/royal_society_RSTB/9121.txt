Modelling geometry and most important contributions to the flux perceived by an observer. MRR, maximum reflection radius which is equivalent to the
average distance between obstacles; MSR, maximum radius for second order of scattering computation. The case of the propagation of light pollution is, in fact, very and constant lamp properties is considered. Ground reflectance
different from the well-studied propagation of sunlight because was made uniform over the modelling domain. The ground
the sources of light pollution are spread on a large surface in elevation was set to zero for most of the grid points, except for a
comparison with the distance from the observer.
