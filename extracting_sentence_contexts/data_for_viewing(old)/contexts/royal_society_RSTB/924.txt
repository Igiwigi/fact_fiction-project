306 DR. A. A. KANTHACK AND MR. W. B. HARDY ON THE CHARACTER

Under these circumstances the eosinophile attack takes place and the bacilli
killed, but there are no scavengers to clear away the traces of the fray, and the f
remains strewn with bacilli, which, if they are not dead, have at any rate complete
lost the power of growing in the drop.

The Changes in the Specific Granulation of the Eosinophile Cell.

The Amphophile Granule (fig. 17A).—The facts discovered by following t
phenomena exhibited in a hanging drop, were supplemented by the examination ¢
such drops, or of lymph taken from the body, when fixed and stained with th
methylene-blue solution, or with eosin and methylene-blue at different intervals a te
inoculation.* The same phenomena, the attack of the eosinophile cell, the forma: ia
of plasmodial masses, and the final phagocytosis, are again seen, but new light |
thrown on the glandular nature of the activities of the eosinophile cell. In the attael
on a bacillus the cell discharges, more or less completely, its granules. The amoun
of discharge depends on the strength of the stimulus. If, for instance, a considerab
number of cells attack -a bacillus, then the discharge will be only partial in many
the cells. The process of the discharge of granules was followed with high power
If a cell attacking bacilli be watched under Oc. 4, Ob. sth, the granules will be see
to travel either singly or in groups of two, three, or four, from the central mass ¢
