of ‘complex time’. Similarly, t(Q), #(Q) and r(Q) are complex functions which, by construction, are
locally holomorphic.

One of the advantages of the complexified picture is that all the leaves L,,,-, (both regular
and singular) are now connected, each of them intersects the section Vj at exactly one point and,
moreover, every regular point Q (even if it belongs to a singular leaf) can be joint with Nj by a
continuous path lying on the leaf. Note that the regular part of each leaf Le, 2. can be understood
as a complex trajectory of the complex flow o! or &!.

The problem coming with ‘complexification’ is that t(Q) and #(Q) are not uniquely defined any
more. Indeed, the complex leaf £,,,-, = {H = £1,4 = €2} is now a two-dimensional surface with a
non-trivial topology. In particular, the first homology group of Lz,,.. is non-trivial and this leads
to the fact that Q can be reached from \j in many different ways, e.g. o!! (Qo) =0'2(Qo) = Q. So
we need to make sure that the choice of t; does not affect the final result of (the complex version
of) (5.1) and (5.2).

Let us discuss this issue in more detail. Consider one particular leaf C,,,.. (not necessarily
regular). It intersects the section Nj at exactly one point Qo. For Q € Le,,¢., consider a path y(s)
connecting this point with Qo so that y(0)=Qp and y(1)=Q. Each point of this path can be
written as y(s) = o!)(Qg) = 5!) (Qo) with f(s), f(s) : [0,1] > C being continuous and t(0) = #(0) =0.
In this way, we set t(Q) = ¢(1) and #(Q) =#(1). It is easy to see that deforming y(s) continuously
does not change ¢(Q) and 1(Q). Thus, t(Q) and #(Q) (and consequently r(Q) = t(Q) — 1(Q)) are
uniquely defined if we fix the homotopy type of a curve connecting Qo and Q. If we choose
two homotopically different curves y; and y2, then, in general, ty(Q) # t2(Q) and 4(Q) Fbo(Q).
