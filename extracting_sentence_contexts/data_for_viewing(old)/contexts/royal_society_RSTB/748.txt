AND THE ORGANISMS COMPOSING IT. 143

Many of the cells which fall into the liquid die, apparently from want of oxygen ;
but this is by no means the case with all, and, although Mycoderma is distinctly
an aérobian form, I have nevertheless got it to grow in hanging drops of gelatine—
where the supply of free oxygen must, at most, be very limited, and even in gelatine,
compressed between a cover-slip and a glass slide—where the access of oxygen must
have been reduced almost to a minimum.

This Mycoderma is particularly apt to form in the preliminary cultures made at low
temperatures—12° to 15° C.—and especially when glucose is employed instead of
cane-sugar, though (still with reference to the preliminary cultures) it is by no means
slow to appear on ordinary PasrEur’s solution, These facts are quite in accord with
Hansen’s statements* that Mycoderma is unable to invert cane-sugar or to bring
about its fermentation; and that it is apt to appear on lager beer even in the
cold cellars.

In illustration of its well-known ubiquity, I may mention that whenever a piece of
unsterilised ginger was used, or a mass fermentation allowed to go on in open vessels,
and so on, this form invariably made its appearance at ordinary temperatures. At
higher temperatures, however—e.g., 30° C.—it was often kept in abeyance, even in
the separation-cultures ; this was not because the Mycoderma will not grow at 30°C.,
but because it suffered in the struggle with competing forms. Sooner or later, when
the dominant fermentation was finished, it invariably manifested itself if present.
It was much more difficult to prevent it gaining the upper hand in glucose solu-
