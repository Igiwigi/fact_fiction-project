For instance, strong strain rates can greatly enhance dispersion of particles and
influence mixing of scalars or can adversely affect flame propagation in reacting flows [8-11]. Intense strain also leads to generation of intense vorticity, via the well-known vortex stretching
mechanism [12], which in turn influences clustering of inertial particles [13]. In fact, strain and
vorticity are not independent and their coupling implicitly encodes all the multiscale interactions
in the flow [14,15]. While much attention has been recently given to understand this interaction in
the light of vorticity amplification [15-17] and energy cascade across scales [18,19], in the current
work, we present a complementary investigation focusing on amplification of strain (and hence
dissipation rate). The key mechanisms controlling amplification of strain can be readily identified by writing its
transport equation (as derived from the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations):

where @ = V x wis the vorticity vector and IT; = (1/p)(87P/dx;9%)) is the pressure Hessian tensor.
