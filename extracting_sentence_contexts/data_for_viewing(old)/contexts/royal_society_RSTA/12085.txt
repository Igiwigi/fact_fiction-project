kinds of metal, but in no case could it exceed the temperature of the “boil,” or that
moment when the spectrum is most intense.

It must be remembered that the composition of the pig iron used, and the more or
less rapid rate at which it is blown, undoubtedly influence the temperature. The
greater the mass of material operated upon, the greater will be the rise in tempera-
ture. For instance, a greater heat evolution and a higher temperature would result
from the combustion of 10 ewt. of silicon in 12 tons of pig iron during a blow of
12 minutes, than from 1 ewt. of silicon in 5 tons of pig iron blown for 20 minutes.
There is one significant fact to be observed in the spectra of the flame photographed
during the “ boil” and the “finishing stage” which bears upon the temperature of the
metal. When the oxyhydrogen-flame spectra of manganese, manganic oxide, iron,
and ferric oxide are photographed, the number of the lines and bands in the spectra
are not more numerous than with a Bessemer flame spectrum of only one half minute’s
exposure, though the above spectra may have received any exposure from 30 to 80
minutes,

MarsaAti, Warts observed (‘ Phil. Mag.,’ 1870) that the sodium lines 5681 and
5687 may be employed as an index of temperature, since they are present in the
spectrum of any flame containing sodium the temperature of which is hot enough to
melt platinum, but do not appear at lower temperatures. ‘The Bessemer flame does
not show this double line, but only the D lines; neither does it show the lithium
