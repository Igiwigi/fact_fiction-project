Those who maintain such an opinion must
adduce the proofs of it. Let. us inquire to what they amount. While the connexion of the neryes with the brain and spinal marrow exists,
the nerves are capable of exciting the muscles, causing the evolution of caloric
which supports animal temperature, forming the secreted fluids from the blood,
and supporting the other processes of assimilation by which the structure of
the various organs is maintained *; but as s80on as this connexion is inter-
cepted, all these functions begin to fail, and s0on cease, nor do we pos8ess a
single fact to prove that there are any means in the nerve itself of maintaining
or renewing any of them. By mechanical impulse the power which remains
in a separated nerve of the cerebral class, for eyen this is not the case with
respect to the ganglionic nerves, may be directed to its extremities and made
evident by the excitement of the muscle in which it terminates ; but indepen-
dently of such an impulse we have no means of exciting a nerve separated from
the brain and spinal marrow, even during the short time it retains the influ-
ence it has received from those organs }. The very circumstance of the nerves: being the means of conveying the in-
fluence of the brain and spinal marrow affords a presumption that they are not

may here act merely as conductors.

but otherwise uninjured, will, as Mr.
