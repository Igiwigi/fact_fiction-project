First, because the conditions of temperature and pressure are so entirely
different in the two eases compared, that no argument drawn from one can be applied
to the other. In one case, a reaction is initiated in a mixture of carbonic oxide,
oxygen, and nitrogen at the atmospheric temperature and pressure ; in the other, the
same gases are at an enormously high temperature and pressure when the reaction
begins. Secondly, because M. Berruenor, in the same paper, has drawn from
analogous facts an argument in an exactly opposite sense. Having determined the
initial rate of explosion of hydrogen and oxygen, and of carbonic oxide and oxygen
