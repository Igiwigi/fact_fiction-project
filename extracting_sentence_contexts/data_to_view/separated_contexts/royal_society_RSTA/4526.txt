But this does not seem to be the whole story, as previous work also makes clear that

successful exploitation of uncertainty is restricted neither to pleasurable products nor to the age “3
of the Internet. Indeed, the contrast between the diversity of the domains in which ignorance : a
has been constructed and the similarities in the manner in which it has been done suggests that :<
the construction of ignorance does not depend on the particular vulnerabilities of any particular : s
science (e.g. epidemiology) nor on any particular time period or cultural setting (e.g. the age of 12

the Internet). This paper attempts to contribute to the growing corpus of scholarship on this subject by
examining an additional example that historians have noted in passing but not considered in
depth: the campaign by the US electricity industry to undermine support for public generation
of electricity, by claiming (counter-factually) that it was not cost-effective and that it would
undermine the American way of life. The similarities between the electric industry strategy and : =
the defence of tobacco, lead paint, fossil fuels and other products suggest that these strategies 3
work for reasons that are not specific to the particular technical claims under consideration. This
paper seeks to call attention to this observation: that the strategies used to create doubt in diverse nee)
settings are strikingly similar, even in regard to issues that might seem in their technical aspects :
to be quite different.
