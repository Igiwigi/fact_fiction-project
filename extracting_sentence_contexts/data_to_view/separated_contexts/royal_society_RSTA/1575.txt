oscillations may survive or decay, depending on the intensities of both terms. In fact, this
competition gives birth to different effects on the dynamics of an oscillator, as studied in [4],
where it has been analysed how the dissipation can introduce uncertainty in the topology of the
phase space of the system and how the forcing can counter it. Here, we aim to extend the current knowledge on the effects of dissipation for time-delayed
oscillators. This kind of systems include a term that depends on a time interval [â€”1,0] of the
history of the system, where t is the time delay.
