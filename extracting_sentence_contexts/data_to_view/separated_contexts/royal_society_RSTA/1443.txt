So, there can be no excuse for ignoring them.


3. Complex systems do not (generally) obey Gaussian statistics

BD radicalism draws heavily upon a fairly general fact of life: the Law of Large Numbers, the
main content of which is that, with enough samples, call it N, errors (uncertainty) are bound
to surrender to certainty. The most famous aspect of this fact is the square-root law of the
noise /signal ratio:

o 1

in * UN’
where mm is the mean value and o its root-mean-square associated with a given stochastic process : >
X. In other words, let ny = (x1 + ---xNn)/N be the mean value of a given quantity X as obtained —
from N measurements, i.e. the data. It is well known that my approaches the correct mean, m, a
in the limit of N — oo.
