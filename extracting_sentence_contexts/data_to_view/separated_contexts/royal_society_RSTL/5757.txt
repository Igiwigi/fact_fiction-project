Blood-corpuscles, however, were found strewed about between
the sheath and the walls of the organ, apparently occupying a network of channels.
"Towards the root of the cesophagus, where the sheath is not 80 much constricted, large
blood-channels or lacunes? are situated between it and the walls of the tube. These
may be denominated the great cxsophageal lacunes ; while those of the other portion of
the alimentary tube may be named the visceral lacunes, as they seem to form part of
a system which extends to the liver and heart. Now, all the bands which pass from the alimentary tube to the parietes are, in fact,
duplicatures of this sheath, and accordingly they are found to be composed of two layers,
each with its proper epithelial covering. The layers are exceedingly delicate, transpa-
rent, and homogeneous; and between them are situated-numerous blood-lacunes, which
are narrow anastomosing channels. 'Phose in the gastro-parietal bands run ?, for the most
part, in the direction of their length, and communicate at one extremity with the visceral
