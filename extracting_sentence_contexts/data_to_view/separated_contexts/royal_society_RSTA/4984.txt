It may be noted that, in the case of a Hertzian cone crack formed owing to the sliding of a
sphere on a surface under a normal load, it has been suggested [33] that because of the tilt of Pz to
the surface normal the axis of any Hertzian cone crack formed will be along P2, which means that
the front part (in the direction of sliding) of the skirt of the cone crack will make a smaller angle
to the glass surface than the rear part of the skirt of the cone crack. The high-speed photographic
sequence presented in figure 8 shows the inclination of the Hertzian cone crack being opposite
to the suggestion made in [33]. As suggested by us earlier [34], the orientation of the cone crack
is controlled by the fact that, after the formation of the ring crack under the impacting sphere,
the contact disc between the sphere and the glass surface covers more and more of the front part
of the ring crack owing to the sliding and at the same time the rear part of the ring crack will =
be covered less and less by the contact disc. This means that the front part of the Hertzian cone :
crack will grow along steeper stress trajectories than the rear part of the cone. As a result, the front :
part of the cone crack will make a larger angle with the impact surface than will the rear part of nee)
the cone. :
