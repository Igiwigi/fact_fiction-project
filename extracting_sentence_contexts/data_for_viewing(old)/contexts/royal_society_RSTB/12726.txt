negative (i.e. w; >0 for all i € I) and to be one on average (i.e. Vier qi Wi = Vier 4: (9}/4i) =DLierq; = 1). Finally, I notate the
character value of the offspring of parent i by z; = 2; + Azi, where Az; simply describes how parent and offspring differ
and we impose no constraints on whether this quantity is positive or negative or zero. Where a parent has multiple offspring
that vary in their character value, one can interpret z;' as an average taken over the brood.

With these definitions in place, the difference between the average trait value of the parent and offspring aggregates is
AE e1(2)) = Eier(@')) — Ese (2) = 0 /2/ — S021 = Do aitwil@i + Axi) — YO gis = 0 gitwizs — S3 giz + YO giv iz

where, in the final line, I have made use of the fact that Eje; (w;) = 1. Noting that Eje; (w;z;) — Ejer (w;)Eier (Z;) = Covier (Wj,2)),
I arrive at equation (2.1) of the main text

AE jer (Zi) = Covier (w;,2i) + Eier WjAzi).

Price’s equation expresses overall evolutionary change as the sum of a ‘selection’ term AcEj</(z;) = Covje(w;,z;) and a
‘transmission’ term AyEj<)(z;) = Eje(w;Az;). These terms provide very general definitions of the concepts of selection and trans-
mission that apply across a very wide domain, including the biological and the non-biological, and to evolutionary changes
occurring through time as well as to other kinds of population transformation that occur across space and other dimensions.

In many applications, it is desirable to express the action of selection as an expectation over future uncertainty as to how
the offspring aggregation will be constituted, and to thereby eliminate chance effects [16]. To implement this, I assign every
possible outcome a unique index @ and I denote the set of all possible outcomes Q. Then, the total expected change between
