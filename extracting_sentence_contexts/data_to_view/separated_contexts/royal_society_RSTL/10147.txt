In fresh living cells treatment with
sulphuric acid, and staining with methyl violeb and glycerine or HorManx's blue,
showed that, although the protoplasxm had contracted, those portions projecting into
the pits 8till adhered to the pit membrane, and that the threads of protoplasm running
through the pit membrane were continuous on either side with the above-mentioned
symmetrically opposite processes (figs. 14 and 15). The processes, in fact, appear to
be held to the pit membrane by the threads in question in all cages where the con-
tinuity is pronounced. Under a low power the individual threads could not be
distinguished, and the appearance then presented was that of two darkly-stained
threads united by a lighter-stained area running between themâ€”in fact, the very
appearance presented by Mimosa and Robina* (0. figs. 5, 7, 14, and 15).
