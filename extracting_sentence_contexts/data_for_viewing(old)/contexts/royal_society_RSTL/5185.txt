the circulating force were placed at 9. it could only
produce an inverſe circulation, by the communica-

with the like ramifications of the aorta, which ſup-

lance the other opinion, which makes the trunk e,
of the aorta, a portion of the umbilical vein, and
the ſubſtitute of the heart.

Another anatomical fact Proves this laſt opinion;
which is, that the aorta, and eſpecially the ſuperior,
F. ran up as high as the cranium, and was of a
pretty conſiderable ſize, while the venal trunk, d.
had nothing but capillary branches in the upper parts;
{o that it almoſt appeared evident that the veſſel, e. F,
was conneCted with the chief mover of the fluids.
Wherefore, ſuppoſing the trunk, 9. to be the veng
