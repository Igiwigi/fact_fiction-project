Experiments by
Rocoysktrs(") seem to indicate the existence of a law of heat-loss of the form already
studied. In a somewhat different field of application, the laws of heat-loss already studied
probably determine the temperature which a small solid object is able to acquire in
a current of highly heated gas such as a Bunsen or blow-pipe flame. In fact the
hot-wire method seems capable of affording a convenient means of analysing the
velocities and true temperatures of flames or of heated gases in boiler-flues, &c.

It is hoped at a latter date to undertake in detail the study of some of the problems
suggested in the present section. Before closing the writer wishes to express his sincere thanks to Prof. H. T, Barnes,
F.R.S , Director of the Macdonald Physics Laboratory, for the kind way in which he
has facilitated the present work by every means in his power. () Rogovsku, E. A., ‘Comptes Rendus Acad.
