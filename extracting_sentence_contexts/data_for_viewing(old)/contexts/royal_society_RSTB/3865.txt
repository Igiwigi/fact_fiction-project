though this is in agreement with the fact that the flowers’ of Cycadeoidea were
large and solitary, while those of Welwitschia are small and enclosed in spikelets or
strobiloid inflorescence constructions. On the other hand, special features of the floral
mechanism are also in agreement. The peculiar staminal tube is much the same in
both types, as a biological adaptation to subserve the investment and protection of
the gyncecium during the period of expansion, probably as much as a shield from the
action of intense light as from simple desiccation (cf. Papilionacee and Paonia
Moutan). Recapitulatory standpoints are always of interest in floral development,
since there must be a reason for the way in which every factor of growth or time is
initiated or comes into action; thus the original habit of the flower of Welwitschia is
evidently best seen in the full-grown buds, since the extension-mechanism of the
staminal tube is clearly secondary, and as in cleisanthous Graminea, correlated with
the fact that the flowers are no longer exposed in situ by the divergence of the cone-
seales. It is evident that the staminal tube originally functioned in the condition it
has in these buds of exactly fitting over and shielding the central ovule, as that of
Cycadeoidea did the entire gyneecial cone, and the staminal tube of the Papilionacee
does at the present day (tig. 20).

8. Again, a minimum construction being established, this implies a non-minimum
or indefinite ancestral condition. Thus the flower was : (1) hermaphrodite ; (2) with
indefinite parts in all three regions ; also (3) open and expanded to the outer air in
the axils of diverging subtending bracts, and therefore (4) in a more extended
strobilus, much less laterally extended ; #.e., more nearly centric in construction, as is
the general habit of’ non-specialised floral shoots.
