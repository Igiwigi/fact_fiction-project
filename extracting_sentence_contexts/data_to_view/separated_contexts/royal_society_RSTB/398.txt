The movement was also elicited from the centre of the gyrus, as
above stated, at squares 3, 4, 5, 6 (fig. 3), but it was very slight, and at the angle
formed by the two limbs of the sulcus there was no excitable point. As compared to the same movement obtained from the Bonnet Monkey, Macacus
sinicus (see ‘ Phil. Trans.,’ B, 1888), this result from the Orang was characterised as
being much slower in development and execution—in fact, resembling rather the
movement* obtained from the angular gyrus in the Bonnet (vide Professor ScHAFER,
‘Roy. Soe. Proe.,’ and confirmed by ourselves).
