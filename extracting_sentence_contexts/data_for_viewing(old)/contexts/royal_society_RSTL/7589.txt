But more than this. 'The rills are, under favourable lights, seen to be really fissures with
one dark and one Ag side—deep dark fissures. Rills of this remarkable cha-
racter do not appear to be branched ; and in this respect the long rill of Hygi I.
on Mivuer's map for ninety-two miles, may be compared SG the po FA ie
England dyke, which extends from Teesdale to near the Peak on the coast of Yorkshire,
seventy miles, without a branch. Contraction, rather than violent movement of the
< moon's crust, 8eems to 8uit best the facts observed; and the same explanation may be

£ The rill which descends from Herodotus is of a different but equally remarkable cha-
Sxacter. Parting from that dark crater—full perhaps of augitic compounds, in strange
@contrast with its neighbour Aristarchus, which shines as if formed of white trachyte—

S ancient sea, which can hardly be reconciled to the conjecture. 'The rill has no branches;
