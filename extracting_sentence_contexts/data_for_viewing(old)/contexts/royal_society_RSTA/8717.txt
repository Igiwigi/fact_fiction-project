If the chemical combination takes place without a transference of the valency
electrons from one atom to another, which probably happens in many organic
compounds in which electrolytic dissociation does not take place, we might expect the
magnetic properties to be more or less of an additive nature. Pascat’s work confirms
this view (pp. 277-281).

([X.) The author has previously shown that the magneton may be a constituent of
the diamagnetic hydrogen molecule. It appears that this idea may be extended to
carbon and the hydrocarbons in general, where the molecular susceptibility can be
directly calculated from the atomic susceptibilities of the component atoms. ~ The
results, however, are not so convincing when extended to other elements, but the fact
that departures from the additive law occur in such cases leads us to suppose that
some disturbing influence has been neglected. Wextss’s work on salts of the ferro-
magnetic elements, taken in conjunction with our present conception of diamagnetism,
suggests that diamagnetic substances contain magnetons, compensated so as to
produce a diamagnetic effect of the medium in bulk. The forces of chemical
combination may, however, perturb this state, and by rearranging the magnetic elements
give rise to a compound possessing more magnetons than are contained in an unbalanced
state in a ferro-magnetic element. Examples of this are given and also of the reverse
effect which may equally well arise (pp. 281-282).

(X.) The principle of the continuity of magnetic induction, as applied to the local
molecular forcive, suggests a possible interpretation of known anomalies of the
