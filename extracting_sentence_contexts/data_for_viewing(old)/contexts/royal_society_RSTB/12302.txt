(e) High-throughput for statistical power
The number of microorganisms in any environment is stagger-
ing. It has been estimated that 1 L of seawater contains billions
of cells [24]. Just by assuming that each of those cells will phys-
ically interact once with another cell during its life cycle,
hundreds of millions of interactions can potentially occur in
such a small volume. Thus, any attempt to take a snapshot of
these physical interactions necessitates the detection and profil-
ing of millions of such associations in a given experiment. In
contrast to anecdotal observations of physical interactions
from lower-throughput methods such as fluorescence acti-
vated cell sorting (FACS) [17] or micromanipulation, epicPCR
provides throughput that is limited by the sequencing effort
rather than the laboratory effort. This transforms the scale of
observations from anecdotal to a level where the ‘big picture’
of the interaction structure of a system begins to emerge.
Nonetheless, such large-scale interaction profiling necess-
arily leads to detection of certain spurious and random

events. As stated above, certain cells could become physically
associated for reasons that have no biological meaning.
Additionally, the partitioning of the cells into an emulsion
might lead to two cells becoming randomly trapped in the
same compartment. It is therefore crucial that a method for
