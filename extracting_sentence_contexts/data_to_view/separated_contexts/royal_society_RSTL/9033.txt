of unsevered tissue on either side of that tube. The fact of its doing 80, however,
certainly seems to be connected with the fact of the radial tubes being tracts of high
excitability. Now the latter fact, it seems to me, can only be accounted for in one of two
ways, Either (4) we must swppose the course of a radial tube to coincide with that of -
a chain of ganglionic elements, or else (5) we must snppose it to coincide with something
resembling a nerve-trunk—the latter being composed of aggregations of the afferent
lines which we have already supposed to constitute the rudimentary nerve-plexus. According to the first of these snppositions, the comparatively high excitability of the
radial tubes, as well as the pointing of the polypite to the unsevered tube in a specimen
prepared as represented in fig. 8, would both be explained by the further supposition
that when such a ganglion chain is stimulated—either directly or by conduction of the
stimulus from a distance—the ganglionic elements discharge their influence, and 80 add
to the strength of the original stimulus.
