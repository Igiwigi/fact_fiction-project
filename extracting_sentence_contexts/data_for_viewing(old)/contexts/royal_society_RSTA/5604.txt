with a global warming potential 28 times that of CO2, or it may diffuse into the dry soil
matrix with subsequent oxidation to CO2 by methanotrophic bacteria. The widespread aerobic
microbial CH4 oxidation which occurs primarily within the top 10cm layer of undisturbed
soils [61-63] is the only known biological sink of this GHG and accounts for 4-6% of the total
global CHy sink strength [17]. Soil CH oxidation, therefore, has a direct effect on net CHy
emissions from the environment. The rate of soil CH4 oxidation depends on the microbial
activity of methanotrophs and the rate of diffusion of atmospheric CH, within the soil profile
[64,65]. The microbial CH, oxidation process, just like CH4 production by methanogens, is
regulated by a number of environmental factors such as SWC, SOM, temperature, pH and
soil nitrogen content [59,66]. The rate of diffusion of atmospheric CH4 and QO) into the soil
matrix for CH, oxidation is controlled primarily by SWC and the physical soil structure (e.g.
soil texture and compaction) such that waterlogged and fine-textured soils, for instance, have
low gas diffusivity [59,65]. In fact, gas transport into the soil matrix has been suggested to be
the main rate limiting factor for atmospheric CH, oxidation in soils [67]. In the current study,
although SWC and SOM at Site 1 varied within a narrow range, soil CH4 oxidation at the
site increased with both SOM (figure 8b) and SWC (figure 9b). The optimum SWC for CH4
oxidation (where more negative fluxes were observed) in dry soils at Nxaraga was estimated
at approximately 15% (figure 9b): lower and higher SWC values seem to supress CHy oxidation,
either by physiological water stress of methanotrophs at very low SWC or by restricting supply
of both CHy and Oz required for aerobic soil methanotrophic activity at higher SWC [58,65].
The optimum SWC of 15% for soil CH4 oxidation observed at Nxaraga is consistent with
optimum SWCs for methanotrophic activities reported in previous studies: 11% SWC in Whalen
et al. [68] and 20% SWC in Castro et al. [69]. The variation has been suggested to primarily
depend on soil type [70]. Figure 9a further suggests that SWC values between 15% and 50%
enhance CH, emission, rather than oxidation, from the seasonal floodplain soils because as
