Saldin any existing X-ray source (including present-day synchrotrons). This allows the
e-mail: dksaldin@uwm.edu possibility of measuring signals from scattered X-rays of large single molecules,

such as proteins. The traditional limitation of X-ray flux for fragile biomolecules
can be circumvented completely due to the fact that this very bright radiation
is delivered in ultra-short pulses [6-8]. Although the molecules under study
will undoubtedly suffer catastrophic radiation damage, the shortness of the
pulse enables a signal (albeit weak) to be measured from the particle before
its disintegration [4]. In common with other theories developed for extracting
structural information from such molecules, we will first assume [9] that a
single molecule is hit by the X-ray beam at a time, with random orientations
each time.
