Figure 3. (a) Evolution of a KM soliton for p = 1.0, a = 0.5 cmand Â¢ = 0.08. The nine blue curves are measured by the set of
equidistantly separated gauges. The soliton position in time shifts relative to the position at the previous gauge. (b) Comparison
of the wave profile with maximum amplitude, measured 9m from the wave maker (blue top curve), with the predicted

theoretical second-order Stokes wave profile (red bottom curve), evaluated at the point of maximum soliton amplitude. (Online

wave. The measured waves are, in fact, bound waves [41]. They include, additionally, higher
order Stokes harmonics. Depending on the steepness of the waves, these harmonics can be of the
order of three and even higher. Such waves have higher crests and flatter troughs than a purely
