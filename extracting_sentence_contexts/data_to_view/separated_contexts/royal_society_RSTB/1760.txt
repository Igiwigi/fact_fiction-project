But one will perhaps argue, that in such a way we shaped
the facts according to our preconceived opinion, and that in such a state of things, the question might
: be asked : Why struggle at all with the observation of facts, if we can arrive much more easily at the
| desired regularity by simply constructing it according to our preconceived ideas ?
| There is no doubt that the frequency of the oscillations of the curves depends on the largeness of the
material, that is, on the number of age-combinations according to which it has been divided into
parts. The larger the population observed, or the fewer the number of age-combinations established,
the more regular the course of the curves. This is proved by the fact that the quinquennial recapitula-
tion, based on only 54 age-combinations, shows in both axes a nearly absolutely regular course of its
curves, It may thus be supposed that the 59 curves of the yearly age-combinations would also offer a
