But whatever view be taken on this point, the
facts of sterilisation are consistent with either side ; the difference lies in the relative
importance attributed to such processes in the remote past. The facts bearing on views of sterilisation in the Bryophyta have been already
touched upon in 1893,{ but more recently the investigations of GorBet have
filled in developmental details for certain of the Hepaticee which are of special
interest.§ The essential facts for the Bryophyta may be briefly summarised thus :
that while in the Musci the whole mass of the sporogenous tissue is as a rule fertile,
and all the cells undergo the tetrad division, in the Hepatice certain cells of the
sporogenous tissue, isolated or in groups, may be either obliterated during the
development of the rest, or may remain at maturity as sterile cells, constituting in
some cases considerable tracts of tissue; conversely, cells normally sterile may
occasionally become sporogenous. An old observation of Lanizius BentyGa\| records
