corner. It is of use for observing what lines intersect or do not intersect a number —
of non-intersecting straight lines, such as the six numbered 20, 21, 8, 11, 3, 4, or the
six numbered 26, 27, 5, 2, 9, 10.

Figure D is arranged to show that it is possible to form a closed polygon of all the
twenty-seven lines, such that no side intersects either of the sides next but one to
itself.

This figure is of use for observing what lines intersect, or do not intersect, the
sides of.a closed quadrilateral, pentagon, or hexagon, such as are formed by the
lines numbered 26, 17, 1, 19; 16, 23, 26, 17, 1, and 2, 3, 10, 11, 9, 4 respectively.

* It has been remarked as an omission in this paper that the fact that these twelve lines form a
“double six” is nowhere stated.
