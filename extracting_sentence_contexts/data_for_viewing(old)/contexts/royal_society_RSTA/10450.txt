Eat \ = 4577°36 and \ = 4577'40 in the xenon and krypton spectra respectively ;

Amention should also be made of the bright lines at \ = 3330°90 and \ = 3330°88 in
the two spectra.

As regards Livernc and Dewar's values for the wave-lengths of these gases, it
will be seen from the tables that there is in general a complete agreement in the
fourth significant figure between the two sets of measurements, A great number of
lines which do not appear in LiverG and Drewar’s lists have been measured ; this is
only to be expected from the fact that these observers in all probability were not
dealing with perfectly pure gases. The relative intensities of the lines are about the
same in the two series of measurements, but of ‘course the general average of
intensity in Liveinc and Dewar'’s measurements is the weaker. ‘These observers

give in their tables of the krypton and xenon spectra a few lines which do not appear
on any of my plates, and which therefore it is probable do not belong to these
spectra. Lrverye and Dewar’s list of the wave-lengths of the lines in the spectra
of the most volatile constituents of the atmosphere contains 162 lines, which, as far
as I can judge, do not belong to neon. The neon used for this work was undoubtedly
