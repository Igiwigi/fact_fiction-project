327.) ; believing that the apparent growth
and diminution, and the final * absorption of the nucleus,‚Äù supposed by ScnLeipen, as
well as the nature of his nucleolus, are to be thus explained. If 80, however, it will
be seen that the formation of the nuclens precedes that of the nucleolus, instead of
being consequent upon it, as supposed by ScHLEDENTf. There seems, in fact, to arise
at the surface of the nucleus a snccession of objects, each of which, in turn, is a nu-
cleolus: and this after the formation of the cell. More particularly considered, the
process 8eems to be as follows. The progressive resolution of the germinal spot into
layers of incipient cells, has shown us that the formation of each snccessive layer is
preceded by a finely granular appearance, the latter surronnding a pellucid fluid.
