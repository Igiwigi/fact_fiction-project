Another explanation was given by Fow er of the curious,
elongated: cells with fibre-bundles, observed by HetpEr ; while the roundish cells with
calcareous, granular, and fibrous contents were little regarded. Bourne* said
Hriper might have inferred the rod-like (fibrous) appearance within the cells could
not be calcareous in structure, otherwise the rods would have been dissolved by the
action of the acids used in decalcifying the specimens. In defence of Herprr I
would draw attention to the fact that the latter saw those fibres in cells, many of
which were still highly protoplasmic, and that my experience has been a very slow
action of decalcifying acids on the contents of such cells. The skeleton proper
dissolves rapidly, but the superficial layers next the body-wall of the polyp dissolve
slowly and incompletely, leaving protoplasmic remnants. On the other hand, both Fowrer and Bourne recognized two main varieties of
calicoblasts in the ectoderm, “ rounded or polygonal, soft-looking, granular cells,” and
“Jong, narrow, columnar cells.”
