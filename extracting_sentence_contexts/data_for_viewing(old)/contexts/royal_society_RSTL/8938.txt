The ninth letter is addreſſed to Mr. Boſe, profeſ-
for of mathematics and philoſophy at Wittemberg ;
and is in anſwer to one of Mr. Boſe, in which this
gentleman expreſſes himſelf ſurpriſed, that ſo many
ages have patled, without it having been diſcovered,
that thunder eleftriſes bodies ; ſince it depends upon
an experiment ſo ſimple, and which it is hardly poſ-
fible to fail in, when you deſire to repeat it under
proper circumſtances.

Upon this our author obſerves, that people in ge-
neral only ſee the facts, and are ignorant of, or do
not conſider, the means, by which philoſophers arrive
at them; nor perceive the circumſtances, without
which theſe phznomena could never have been made
known to us; and that Mr. Boſe will ceaſe to be ſur-
priſed, as he is ſo well verſed in theſe phanomena,
when he reflects upon what our author offers.
