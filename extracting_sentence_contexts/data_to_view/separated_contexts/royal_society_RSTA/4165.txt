In fact, von Neumann also errs in this passage, as the ‘ihre’ is an interpolation. Nevertheless, the meaning of the passage is clear: in 1932, von Neumann interpreted probability
in a frequentist manner. Evidence of this occurs throughout MFQM, in fact. For example, ‘expectation value’ is defined
as ‘the arithmetic mean of all results of measurement in a sufficiently large statistical ensemble’
(p. 308). Liiders [43], who improved upon von Neumann’s theory of measurement, also thought in
terms of ‘an ensemble of identical and independent systems’ [einer Gesamtheit gleichartiger und
unabhangiger Systeme].
