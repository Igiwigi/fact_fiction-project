Because the pth power of every element of
G belongs to F, G is integrally dependent on § (and hence © is the only valuation ring of
G lying over %). The degree of Q over & is 1; that is to say, every element of G is congruent mod Q to an

element of %. In fact, any element of © is obviously congruent mod Q to an element of H;

Sand hence the assertion follows without difficulty from the relations
