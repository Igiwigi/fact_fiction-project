the genera Lepidophloios and Lomatophloios, assigning the upper position to the
former one, and the lower to the latter, a course lately followed also by Renavtr.
Weiss, in my mind, far more judiciously, reverted to Bronantart’s plan, and re-
united the two genera.

But it is to be noted that most of the fragments of the plants concerned bear no
characteristics enabling us to determine which is the upper and which the lower end
of the specimen. This is the case with SreRNBERG’s original figure ; hence it would
appear more reasonable that, in the absence of other features distinguishing
Lepidophloios from Lomatophloios, the two should, in accordance with the views of
Bronentart and Weiss, be united under the former name, as being that first
published, But a small addition to the definition of the former, already quoted,
should recognise the fact that in some examples of the genus the leaf-scar may
occupy the inferior position. Anyhow, such will be the plan adopted in the following
pages.

These Lepidophloioid leaves are well preserved in the fructigerous branch of which
fig. 254 represents the natural size. Each circular area corresponds to what was
primarily a very slightly projecting deciduous branch. In the centre of each circle is
the flattened mamilla, c, of a Halonial tubercle. The Lepidophloioid leaf-cushions are
arranged also in circles surrounding each Ulodendroid area, This arrangement is
exactly what would occur where any young leafy shoot sprang laterally from a more
vertical primary one.

In this specimen we thus find combined the tips of the tubercles and the multiplied
