It is easy to conceive how warmth may be imparted to a
foetus situated in the uterus. The materials for nourisbment, it receives from the placenta;
but the precise manner in which they are supplied has not yet
been discovered. Of the fact there can be no doubt, because
there are many cases on record, in which there could be no
other possible way by which support could be had.*

With respect to vital air, (or oxygen,) the young of all vivi-
parous animals, whilst in the uterus, live in the same medium
as fishes, and have a structure similar to gills, for the exposure
of their blood to it: this structure is the placenta. The heart of the foetus is adapted to this mode of life, and
in effect consists but of one auricle and one ventricle, as it is

phical Transactions for the year 1793:

found to do in fishes. The junction between the two ventricles
is attended with a great advantage, in performing the circula-
tion through the placenta ; where the length and convolution
of the umbilical vessels, in some animals, offer a great resistance
to the force of the heart, and render more- exertion necessary.
