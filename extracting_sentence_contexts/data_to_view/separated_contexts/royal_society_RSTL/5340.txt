any such quantity as [9: 941-9, ] may betermed a Cumnlant, of which q;, 9:14, may
be severally termed the elements or Components, and the complete arrangement of the
elements may be termed the Type. The cumulant corresponding to any Type remains
unaſſected by the order of the elements in the Type being reversed, as is evident from
any cumulant being in fact representable under theform of a symmetrical determinant,
