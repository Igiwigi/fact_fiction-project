It was considered sufficient to ascertain whether the composition of the light
emitted by the ring was similar to that of the faint blue haze visible in the bulb
while the induction-coil discharge was passing. This was found to be the case over a
range from about 44365 to 45451. Great difficulty, however, was found in distin-
guishing the lines owing to their feeble intensity, nor was it possible to obtain
satisfactory photographs of the ring itself.

The Ring in Rotation.

The want of uniformity in the density of the glowing nebulous stream constituting
the ring enabled its rotation to be plainly made out. The following experiment,
however, placed the fact beyond a doubt.

A bulb, similar to that shown in fig. 8, was exhausted and a discharge passed

through it. It will be seen that a luminous ring forming under the influence of the
magnets would, in this case, partially envelop the wings of the light mica vane, V,
so that, if the ring revolve, the vane might also turn, and by the direction of its
