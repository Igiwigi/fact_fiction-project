being divided horizontally into two partitions by a thin plate of celluloid, tin-foil, or
some other convenient septum. This septum was perforated with a hole of known
dimensions, one compartment being filled with clear gelatine and the other with
gelatine and dye, the two solutions only being in contact across the perforation.

It is extremely interesting to watch the changing form of the limiting surface of
dye and colourless gelatine under these circumstances as diffusion progresses. Its
ellipsoidal shape is well shown, especially in the very early stages, the major axes of
the ellipsoids being in the plane of the septum, and their common foci in the edges
of the circular hole. It is also seen that the surfaces of equal density approach
nearer to each other at the diaphragm than farther away from it, thus accounting
for the more rapid lateral creep of the dye at the margin of the hole. This last-
mentioned fact illustrates experimentally the deduction of Sreran, to which we have
already called attention, that, in the strictly analogous phenomenon of evaporation
from a circular disc, evaporation is greater at the edges of the disc than nearer the
centre.

As the diffusion progresses the spheroid of coloured gelatine approaches nearer to
the dimensions of a hemisphere, which, however, it never actually reaches.

Such experiments, conducted side by side with apertures of different sizes, can be
made to illustrate the “diameter law” if the volumes of the spheroids proceeding
from apertures of different diameter are compared for equal times of diffusion. This

is shown in the following table for two sets of measurements :—
