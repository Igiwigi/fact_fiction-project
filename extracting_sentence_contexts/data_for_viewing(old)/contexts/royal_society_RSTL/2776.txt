tions along the same channel will make the tide-hour nearly constant along a con-
siderable tract of coast, while it varies rapidly at the extremities of this tract. I

296 THE REV. W. WHEWELL ON TIDE OBSERVATIONS

remarked that we find an exemplification of such a case in the tides of the 8outh coast
of England, from the Isle of Wight to the Land's End, as observed at the coast-guard
stations in June 1834. At the period of writing that paper the observations of the
south coast only had been reduced. I can now state that we have a much more re-
markable example of the same fact in the tides on the east coast of Ireland. The
rapid change of the tide-hour in passing round the northern and southern extremities
of this coast is very remarkable, and may be seen in Tables III. and IV. Thus in
passing round Rachlin Island and Fair Head, which form the north-eastern point of
Ireland, through the narrow strait left by the Mull of Cantire, the tide-hour advances
suddenly from 64" to 103%. In the same manner in passing round Carnsore Point,
from the south to the east coast of the county of Wexford, the tide-hour advances
from 53Â® to 104), and 11" in a very short distance.

Also when such hinges of the tide are once passed, the hour is nearly constant along
the whole of the coast, as we have seen that it ought to be from general considera-
tions. Thus all the way from Arklow in the south to Glenarm and Larne in the
north of the eastern side of Ireland, the tide-hour at exposed points of the coast is
