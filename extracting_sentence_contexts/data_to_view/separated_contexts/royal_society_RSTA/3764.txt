The state of the circulating working body is changing cyclically; the working body delivers a part
of its energy to the ‘lower’ or cool reservoir, i.e. the reservoir of low temperature T_(heat sink). We shall designate averaged intensity of heat flux transferred from hot source by q,; the
corresponding averaged intensity of heat flux transferred to cold source is designated by q. The efficiency index, which is, in fact, the first law efficiency, n =p/q4, is defined as the ratio
of work produced and driving heat q+. Let us consider the effect of o on n. The balance equations for energy and entropy are

q+ —q-—p=0 (G1)

and
q+ q-

To te=0 (3.2)


Vanishing right-hand sides of these equations correspond to the fact that the state of working
body either generally does not change in time (vapour and gas turbines) or changes cyclically
(vapour machines).
