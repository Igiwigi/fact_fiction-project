That the high concentration }N could not exist over the whole of the discharge tube can
be seen by considering the energy required to produce such ionization. Since the volume of
the gas in the torus is approximately 500 cm.* the energy required is 500.VE/2 electron volts,
where EF is the ionization potential. The values of this quantity are given in the last column
of table 1, where E has been taken as 15 V. (These figures represent the absolute minimum
energy required to produce such ionization. In actual fact the average energy dissipated in
producing an ion pair is probably at least 30eV.) The energy stored by the condensers is
180 joules, and about two-thirds of this is dissipated in the gas, i.e. 120 joules. At the time
of the peak gas current only about half the energy has been dissipated. There is thus a maxi-
mum of 60 joules available for ionization. It is thus clear that there is not sufficient energy
available to produce such ionization throughout the whole volume of gas.

The discharge at the feed-point gap

The study of the light from the torus showed that the discharge at the feed point differs
considerably from that at the inspection window. This effect must be caused by a difference
in either the electric or magnetic fields occurring at these points after breakdown. The only
extra electric field at the feed point is the ‘electrostatic’ field considered above, but since this
