Conductivity, together with temperature,
was used to calculate water salinity [24]. Anomalies caused by

senting approximately 30-35% of total body oxygen, but
otariid seals (19% lung, 47% blood) rely more on their lung
oxygen stores and less on their blood oxygen stores compared
with phocid seals (5% lung, 60-65% blood) [6,7]. In fact,
because of these assumptions, differences in oxygen stores

are likely to be even greater than these body oxygen store cal- air bubbles around the sensor cause the conductivity/salinity
culations suggest, particularly that for lung oxygen stores. In measurements to drop dramatically (see [18]). Video recordings
