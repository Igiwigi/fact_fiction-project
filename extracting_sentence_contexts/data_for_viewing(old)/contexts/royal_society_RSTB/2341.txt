* The case in fact would be analogous to STEFAN’S evaporation problem reversed, when the partial
pressure p’ of the vapour at the surface of the liquid is not at its maximum for the temperature and
pressure of the experiment, and its true value is unknown. All other conditions being the same, we
shovld still expect the value of M to vary with the diameters of the discs, but the value of & would not be
determinable.

+ It is desirable to smear the edge of the tube with a trace of vaseline to prevent creeping of the
solution and efflorescence of the soda,
