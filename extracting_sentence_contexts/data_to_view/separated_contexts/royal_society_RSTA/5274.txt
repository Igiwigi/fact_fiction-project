except that whose cosine is 4 v/V, the same direction as that already (§ 13) indica’
as possessing a zero Doppler effect. But the observation of the lag of phase thus caused by motion of the entire ethe
medium is not so easy as might appear, and, in fact, it has not yet been detected ; fo
the simple reason that it is liable to affect both the interfering rays equally : as we no
