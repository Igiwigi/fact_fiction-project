should have little reason to suspect the underlying histological diversity of their apical
growing points. It thus appears (as de Bary, Sachs and others so clearly saw) that it is the
plastic apical region as a whole that is of primary importance in morphogenesis and not its
cellular construction, though, on a further analysis, it is seen that the two aspects are
probably reciprocal. The plastic apical region comprises the relatively slow-growing region
at the extreme tip of the shoot and the more rapidly growing region below it—the subapical
region. In view of the close similarity between the apices of ferns and seed plants in respect of
growth and morphogenetic activity, the presence of a distinctive apical meristem in the
ferns suggests that there is probably a physiologically comparable region at the apex of
seed plants, even although its histological basis is less apparent.

In support of this view, which some observers will doubtless consider to be highly
problematical, mention may be made of some facts emphasized by Foster (1939, 1949) :
(i) ‘that the distinctness and, to some extent, the type of zonation in the shoot apex vary
with the phase of activity of the meristem’, and (ii) ‘the the number of tunica layers
varies widely between species and genera and the sharpness of the boundary between
tunica and corpus may fluctuate even within the same species at different phases of its
ontogeny’ (1949). Moreover, just as Van Fleet (1948) has shown that apparently similar
parenchymatous cells of the cortex may have very different physiological reactions, so, too,
it may be assumed, as a working hypothesis, that the equidimensional meristematic cells
in different regions of the tunica are not identical in their physiological properties. In this
view the superficial cells at the summit of the dicotyledonous shoot would be regarded as
having distinctive properties, as in the ferns. To this may be added the fact that some

investigators have rejected the tunica-corpus theory as not affording an adequate account
