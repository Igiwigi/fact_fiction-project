In a median view of the third trunk limb of Daphnia, close above the bases of the
fringe of filter setee and well towards the posterior end, is a ridge, which looks like a
tubercle, carrying a short slightly curved seta. This ridge can only be seen in an
undisturbed preparation. On flattening the limb under a cover-slip the seta can be
found only with difficulty and then it appears merely as one of the group of spines with
which the endite series terminates; in fact, it is so inconspicuous that LintgEBoRG
omitted it from his figure of the undisturbed limb. A similar spine can be seen in
Simocephalus. It represents the posterior spine of the claw-bearing ridge of the
gnathobase and that this is so can again be seen from the more primitive form Moina.
