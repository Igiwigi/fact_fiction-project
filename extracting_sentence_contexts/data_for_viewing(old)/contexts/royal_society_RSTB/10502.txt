aspect. That is, in order for an action successfully to reduce pre-
diction error, the brain must represent not only the hidden
causes of current sensory signals but also must use these rep-
resentations to predict how sensory signals would change
under specific actions [35]. Interestingly, it has been suggested
that such counterfactual aspects of perceptual prediction
may underlie basic properties perceptual experience, such as
‘presence’ or ‘objecthood’ [36].

To enable predictions about the consequences of action to
be fulfilled, we have to attenuate proprioceptive prediction
errors—that would otherwise deliver unequivocal evidence
that we are not, in fact, acting. This attenuation rests on redu-
cing the precision of proprioceptive prediction errors.

Precision can be regarded as a measure of signal-to-noise or
confidence. Mathematically, precision is the inverse variance
or reliability of a signal. Estimating precision speaks to a fun-
damental aspect of inference, namely, the encoding of
precision or expected uncertainty [37-39]. In other words,
we have to infer both the cause of our sensations and the
context, in terms of the (expected or subjective) precision of
sensory evidence. This represents a subtle but ubiquitous
problem for the brain, where the solution rests on modulating
the gain or excitability of neuronal populations reporting
