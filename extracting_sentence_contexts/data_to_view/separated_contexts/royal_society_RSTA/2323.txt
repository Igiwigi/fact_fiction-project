Any estimate for the B-wave is correspondingly subject to uncertainty. At least,
however, the £-wave attenuation is much greater than that for the a-wave, for w smaller than
about 0.3c;/a and this tends to confirm its minor role at low frequency. The fact that it remains

finite as w — 0 implies that the associated value of pet tends to infinity (see equation (6.20)
with B replacing w).
