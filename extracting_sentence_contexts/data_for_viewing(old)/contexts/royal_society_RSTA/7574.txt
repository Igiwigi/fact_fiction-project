what determines which arrangement is formed? What, for instance, decides whether
a 30% solution of sodium carbonate at 10° C will deposit crystals of a-Na,CO,.7H,O,
f-Na,CO,.7H,O or Na,CO,.10H,O?

There does not appear to be any well-known and established theory on this subject.
Ostwald (1897) has stated a rule covering the order of appearance of unstable phases which
implies that when an unstable system undergoes transition, it is always into the least stable
of the other possible systems. Hence the least stable and most soluble of the unstable solids
should appear first. Ostwald’s rule, however, was shown not to be true by the investigations
of Young and Burke (1906) in the system sodium thiosulphate-water.

It is probable that an improved version of Ostwald’s rule could be sustained in which the
guiding factor would not be the metastable solubilities which are, in fact, equilibrium
figures, but ‘supersolubilities’, a supersolubility being defined loosely as the concentration
at which the probability of nucleus formation becomes ‘high’. For a summary of views on
the subject of labile regions and supersolubility see Clark et al. (1944). Miers & Isaac (1909)
were able to plot experimental supersolubility curves for the three forms of monochloracetic
acid in water or naphthalene under conditions of roughly comparable agitation, but it was
never certain that a given form would crystallize when it was expected. The supersolubility
curves expressed no more than probabilities. It is perhaps because of the atmosphere of
uncertainty about supersolubility curves that little attention appears to have been paid
to them.

The influence of additives on the preparation of unstable phases can be thought of
broadly, in the first place, in terms of the concept of metastable regions if we assume that
