rachis being given off alternately.
2. The form and venation of the leaflets were those of a Sphenopteris.*

3. Structure of the Petiole and Rachis.

This again is a subject which has been so fully dealt with in previous Memoirs,
that only a few points need be discussed here. q

None of the preparations hitherto figured afford conclusive evidence as to the
structure of the vascular bundle. We will, therefore, first call attention to Plate 18,
photograph 5, which shows a petiole in transverse section; from its small size—2 millims,
in maximum diameter—it no doubt represents one of the ramifications of the main
petiole. ‘The preservation is remarkably perfect, in fact, scarcely a cell is lost. The con-
centric structure of the bundle comes out with astonishing clearness, which could not
be exceeded in a preparation from a recent Fern, The small celled, thin-walled tissue
constituting the phloém is absolutely perfect and completely surrounds the V-shaped
xylem. The maximum thickness of the phloém-zone is found on the convex or
morphologically lower side of the bundle ; it thins out somewhat at the lateral angles, |
and again attains a considerable thickness on the concave upper face. The larger
thin-walled cells bordering on the cortex are best regarded as pericycle. Neither
here nor in any other specimen, do we find any differentiated bundle-sheath or
epidermis ; considering the perfection of the preservation we are probably justified in
concluding that in Lyginodendron, as in the Marattiaces of the present day, a
specialized endodermis was not developed. Secretory sacs are scattered among the
phloém-elements.
