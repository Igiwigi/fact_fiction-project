A second wire, 02 millim. in diameter, was tested and found to give results
almost identical with the above when it was heated in hydrogen for the first time at
860° C. This wire was afterwards heated in hydrogen and later in oxygen for several
days, mostly at a temperature of about 1100°C. A long time after the wire had
again got into a steady condition in regard to the ionisation in oxygen the oxygen
was pumped out and hydrogen re-admitted. The wire was now heated in hydrogen
at 26 millims. pressure at a temperature of 900°C., when it was found that the aboye
slow time changes had almost disappeared. The negative leak when first measured
about 10 minutes after first heating the wire was 6°72x10~ ampére, whilst the
positive was 4°5x 107" ampére. They subsequently rose and fell to 8x 107° ampére
and 6°7x10~% ampére respectively. The difference between the two cases seems to
indicate that heating in hydrogen produces a permanent change in the constitution
of the platinum. There are two other facts which support this contention, One
is the permanent reduction of the value of the steady positive leak in oxygen
produced by continued heating in hydrogen, which was mentioned on p. 27. The
other is that the surface of a wire which has been heated for a long time in hydrogen
becomes visibly pitted and cracked. This change does not appear to be produced by
heating, to moderate temperatures at any rate, in oxygen.

Observations were also recorded of the variation in the ionisation when the gas in
which the wire was heated was changed from hydrogen to oxygen. The change from
one gas to the other was carried out in the same way as in the previous case. Oxygen
was admitted to a pressure of 1:067 millims. and the wire maintained at 900° C.
Under these circumstances the negative leak was found to fall at once to the
small value previously obtained in oxygen. The negative leak when first measured
