Finally, we comment on the applicability of gkdV and gBouss as models for tsunami wave
propagation. Shallow water models have been frequently used to model the propagation of


tsunami waves in the open ocean, see for instance the discussions in [31,32]. The shallow water
assumption is reasonable as the wavelength of tsunamis is much longer than the average ocean
depth. Moreover, the amplitude of a tsunami is very small offshore, typically less than 1m, so
that the smallness assumption on the amplitude is also justified. It has been pointed out in a
series of papers that the applicability of KdV as a model for tsunami wave propagation should
be questioned; see the discussions in [1,2,33,34]. The main argument is that the balance between
nonlinearity and dispersion as embodied by KdV would occur at time and length scales which
cannot be realized on Earth. Our analysis in ยง4 for gkdV shows that the inclusion of Coriolis
effects in the model does not alter this fact.

The discussion in ยง4 shows, however, that gBouss, which was derived in near-field variables
as opposed to the far-field variables used for gKdV, may be an appropriate model to study
tsunami wave propagation, because the relevant distances required for the near-field balance are

more realistic. Our derivation is based on the f-plane approximation, which is applicable in the : =
context of tsunami waves near the Equator. As an example, we mention the 2004 tsunami, which : S
was generated by an earthquake with epicentre off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, and : 2
consequently spread across the Indian Ocean in a neighbourhood of the Equator: one wavefront aed
propagated eastward from the fault line, and another front moved in the opposite direction, : _
roughly parallel to the Equator, cf. [30,35,36]. With regard to applications of these equations to [4
tsunami modelling, the equatorial regions in the Indian ocean are of great interest. Also, a broadly : =
