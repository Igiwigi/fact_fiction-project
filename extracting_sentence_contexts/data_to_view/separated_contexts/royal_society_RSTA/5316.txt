In other words, the further back in time, the
greater the potential for organisms/biota to have existed in different environments than they do
today [43,44]. The PRISM project’s aim is to understand environments and climates of a warmer world [45]. This scientific need has not diminished over the past 20 years; in fact, in the context of current
estimates of future climate change, it is growing ever more acute [46]. Thus, a warm episode,
defined by a negative benthic oxygen isotope excursion in the LR04 stack most likely representing

Figure 2. Position of the first Pliocene time slice (red line) and the PRISM time slab (grey-shaded band), relative to
the geomagnetic polarity, magnetic reversals (black and white boxes), oxygen isotope stratigraphy (LRO4 stack), planktic
foraminiferal zones and calcareous nanofossil zones.

a sea-level high stand, within the current PRISM time slab, is most appropriate for the selection
of the first Pliocene time slice.

(b) Rationale and criteria for selection: where in the PRISM time slab?
