The dynamic range of the observed response is
somewhat larger than modelled, with a few sites approaching 6Â°C. The sites with large deficits
are all associated with complex terrain, mainly Wales or the southwest peninsula, suggesting that
local, orographically modified, flows may enhance the impact. In fact, these sites are those for
which the model tends to perform least well when forecasting temperature and wind, as even
1.5 km is insufficient to resolve the smaller river valleys, so it is quite likely that some of the
observed enhancement is simply forecast error. A second factor modulates the eclipse response. Careful examination of figure 7 shows that
the largest response is under clear skies in rural locations.
