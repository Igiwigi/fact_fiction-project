The response profiles in figure 2a illustrate how the corres-
pondence problem might appear to a visual area downstream
of striate cortex. What rule applied to this response profile will
yield a correct disparity estimate? Using only the population of
neurons shown in figure 2a, this is still a challenging problem
[13]. But recall that this population was generated from a
single monocular Gabor RF. If a similar map is generated for
