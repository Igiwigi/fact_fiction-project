Because this pacific culture persisted after the
ASR returned to values before the outbreak, a causal role of
the change in ASR is not established, however. Thus, patterns
of inter-sexual association, affiliation and aggression appear
to be sensitive to ASR variation, but more research is clearly
indicated to substantiate these relationships. A final point relates to the fact both sexes might derive
benefits from a biased ASR. Males not only benefit from an
increase in the number of potential mates, but females may
also derive direct fitness benefits from an increase in the
number of males in their group. These benefits are primarily
related to the risks of infanticide and predation and therefore
also affect male-female relations in the context of sexual selec-
tion.
