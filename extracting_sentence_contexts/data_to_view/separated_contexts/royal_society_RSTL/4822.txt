Olefiant gas, then, and all its homologues are capable of furnishing two mono-aci
alcohols, exhibiting slightly different features, but presenting in all their principal
characters the most obvious analogies. 'The alcohols formed by fixation of water, nc
as ethylic alcohol, have been long well known; in fact the detailed study which has
been made during the last quarter of a century of most of their derivatives, has exer-
cised the most important influence upon the development of organic chemistry. The same remark does not apply to the alcohols produced from these same hydro-
carbons by fixation of oxygen. The history of allylic alcohol, which we have endeavoured
to trace in the preceding pages, and to which of late important contributions have been
furnished by MM. BerTHeLOT and Dr Luca and by M. Zix1s, begins also to throw
light upon this second group of alcohols.
