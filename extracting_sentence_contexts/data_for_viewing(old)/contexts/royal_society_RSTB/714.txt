outwards into the internal capsule, by the bundles of which it is traversed, contains
. eells which are much larger and more definite in form than any to be found in its
| anterior portion or in the corpus striatum. The largest of these are found on its under
side where they form an almost distinct group, homologous probably with one of the
subthalamic nuclei. They measure as much as 30 p by 14 yp. Their long axes are
placed horizontally, and they appear to be in connection with the white fibres which
& cross the middle line on the under side of the commissura mollis. Athough the
largest of the cells form an ill-defined group by themselves, others almost as large are
¢ found throughout this region, and extend across the middle line in the commissura

[This paper contains little more than a series of detached observations, which are
= published with some reluctance. Although I had been familiar with the main facts
‘a in the cerebral organization of Ornithorhynchus for some years, I had postponed their
+3 publication in the hope of obtaining a supply of well-preserved specimens, from which
E it would be possible to construct a complete monograph. The interest which attaches,
.2 however, to the description of the corpus callosum as a chapter in the history of
@ science, and the peculiar features in the disposition of the rhinencephalon, which may
> serve to throw light upon the relation to one another of the two portions of the
S cerebral hemisphere, seemed to justify a preliminary communication.
£& Since this paper was written, Dr. Jonson Symryeron has published observations
g which confirm my conclusion that the corpus callosum is absent in Ornithorhynchus.
