_ The nature of this relationship is, however, by no means clear. As stated above,
the facts of embryology cannot be ignored. It seems to be well ascertained that the
parathyroids are developed from the epithelium of the third and fourth gill-clefts,
while the thyroid is derived from the median rudiment on the ventral wall of the
embryonic pharynx. Moreover, the two structures do not arise at the same time, and
many embryologists believe that parathyroids only secondarily enter into relation
with the thyroid.
