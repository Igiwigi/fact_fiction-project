312 DR. BREWSTER ON PERIODICAL COLOURS PRODUCED BY THE

image was entirely free of colour. This took place in two specimens, one of
which had 312, and the other 625 grooves in an inch. The spaces n were here
far too wide to produce the new tints, and 80 were the spaces m; but upon
applying the microscope to the grooves m, I saw that they were formed by two
or more grooves ploughed out by the cutting point; 80 that each space m
actually consisted of smaller reflecting spaces, which were sufficiently minute
to produce the periodical colours.

Although in these specimens, therefore, when m is nearly equal to n, we ob-
serve a beautiful coincidence between the positions of the minima on the ordi-
nary and on the prismatic images, yet the fact aboye described seems to show
that they are separate phenomena, and depend, when the grooyes are single, on
the relation between m and n.

The preceding observations relate solely to rays reflected -from grooved
surfaces ; but in consequence of the almost perfect transparency of isinglass in
thin plates, I have been enabled to examine the transmitted tints. The
colours which are thus seen on the ordinary image are extremely brilliant, but
they seem to have no relation whateyer, either in number or in quality, to the
reflected tints. In the specimen which gave by reflexion three orders of colours,
those seen by transmission were only the following.

Fine blue . . . . . . 85 of incidence.
