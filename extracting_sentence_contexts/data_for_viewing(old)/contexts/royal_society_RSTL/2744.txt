tions of this apparently universal agent; for I may add, we havye already some
glimpses of its still more extensive dominion.

IN the preceding paper my objects have been to review the whole of the functions
of the more perfect animal, to ascertain the nature of the powers on which they de-
pend, the seat of each of these powers, the manner in which they are employed in
effecting their several functions, and the manner in which they are associated in pro-
ducing their more complicated results. Nothing in any part of the subject has been
taken for granted, no position having been advanced without a reference to the obser-
vations or experiments on which it is founded.

I have here for the first time made an attempt which could not be done till all the
facts on the subject had been ascertained, to point out the manner in which the
different powers of the living animal influence each other, and thus conduce to their
more complicated results ; by which, being enabled to analyse these results, it might
easily, were this the proper place, be shown, that we better ee the operation of its
different powers in the various deviations from a state of health, and can, under cer-
tain circumstances, better regulate the means of obviating them.
