* That this was the case with the Glen Treig
glacier is I think, as presently explained (p. 684), shown by the direction of the ice
scratches in that part of the Strath Spean immediately opposite the glen. Mr. JamiesoN does, in fact, carry a portion of each glacier for some distance down
these valleys. 80 that one blocked up the entrance of Glen Roy, and the other the
entrance of Glen Speanâ€”but in doing 80 he seems to me to attach too much
importance to their individual action. The formation of the small lake of the Merjelen See, in the Swiss Alps, has been
adduced in illustration of the power of glacier barriers.
