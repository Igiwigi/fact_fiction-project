For e < 10, the analytical
result well matches the numerical counterpart. At large values of ¢, the agreement breaks down,
the numerically identified stability region being much narrower than predicted analytically. The
discrepancy is explained, as mentioned above in the different context, by the fact that the finite-
width potential barrier (4.1), multiplied by large ¢, strongly changes the model, in comparison
with the underlying one which contains the ideal delta-function. The discrepancy decreases if
smaller € is used in equation (4.1), but, on the other hand, the use of the splitting barrier with
a finite width corresponds to the physically realistic situation, as the infinitely narrow barrier
cannot be implemented in the experiment. Lastly, PT-symmetric systems are characterized by the flux of power across the gain-loss
interface, defined as

J=i(ucu” — uyu)|e=0- (4.2)

Normally, J is a growing function of the gain—loss coefficient, y, but there are examples of systems
demonstrating a jamming anomaly, with dJ/dy <0 [72].
