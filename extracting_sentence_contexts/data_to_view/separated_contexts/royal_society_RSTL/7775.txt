VII. Enstatite as & Constituent of the Busti Meteorite. Besides the augitic mineral that has just been described, there is present in this
meteorite another silicate which is in fact its most important ingredient. 'The augite is
present in greatest quantity in the nodule that contains the calcium sulphide, though it
is met with in smaller amount in the other parts of the meteorite. But associated with
it everywhere, and otherwise forming the mass of the stone, is the mineral I have next
to describe.
