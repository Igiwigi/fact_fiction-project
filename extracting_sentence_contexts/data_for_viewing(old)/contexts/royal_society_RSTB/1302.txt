of larger polyp cavities and smaller ccenenchymal tubes. Should the contrary pre
to be the case, the Monticuliporide must be removed from the Helioporide a
placed near to the Tubiporidz and their allies.

It is proper here to enter into the question of the nature of the ccenenchymal cae
in Heliopora. They were compared by Mosetey to the siphonozooids of Sarcopi
and it has been assumed, by many subsequent writers, that the presence o
ccenenchymal tubes in any tabulate coral is evidence of those corals being dimorphi

however, had expressed a doubt as to Mosexxyâ€™s interpretation of the coonenchym |
tubes of Heliopora. In this matter I must agree with von Kocu. The coenenchymal
tubes of Heliopora appear to me to be nothing more than specialised portions of
system of tubular off-sets of the polyp cavity. The fact that they have no opening
to the exterior and that they show no trace of mesenteries, stomodeum or tentacles,
might be explained, as Mosrney explained it, by the extreme degeneration of the
siphonozooids which he supposed them to represent. But in the case of a truly
dimorphic Alcyonarian, such as Sarcophyton, each siphonozooid is a reduced autozooid
and resembles it in essential structure; if an autozooid were formed from a
siphonozooid, it would be by the complete development of the tentacles, stomodeum
and mesenteries of the latter, and not by the coalescence of several siphonozooids.
In Heliopora, we do not find that a single ccenenchymal caecum undergoes complete
development to form a polyp, but that a group of coenenchymal cwca is arrested im
development, and that a calicle takes the place of some seven central coenenchymal
tubes, and that twelve or more immediately circumjacent tubes enter into its
composition, In other words, the autozooid is the result of the arrest in growth of a
