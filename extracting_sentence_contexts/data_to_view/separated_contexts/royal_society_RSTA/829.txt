At any
rate, one could speculate in this context that Einstein’s equation might eventually emerge as
the classical limit of a self-duality condition as it equates the Einstein tensor from the geometry
side to the expectation value of the stress energy tensor from the quantum field theory side,
probably requiring both to be generalized so as to be in a self-dual setting. I do not know the
final framework for this, but the monoidal category dual may be a step in the right direction. In
physical terms, the self-dual nature of quantum gravity as we see it is in line with the fact that the
metric is the background geometry, while its fluctuations are spin-2 fields and hence among the
‘representations’ of the background geometry in the loose sense discussed above. Insummary, we were led on philosophical grounds to the view that space-time should be both
curved and ‘quantum’ in the sense of a non-commutative coordinate algebra, as a consequence of
a deep self-duality principle for quantum gravity [1-3]. We call this aspect the quantum space-time
hypothesis.
