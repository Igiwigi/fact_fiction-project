HEAT OF EVAPORATION OF WATER. 271

and if these points are borne in mind they may serve to explain some of the con-
trivances which might otherwise appear uncalled for.

If the vessel in which the evaporation is taking place is kept at a constant tem-
perature, we are independent of the capacity for heat of it and its contents; we also
dispense with the measurements of changes of temperature. Thus, if matters be so
arranged that the loss and gain of heat throughout an experiment are balanced, many
fruitful causes of error are avoided. Of course, the actual temperature of the calori-
meter during evaporation must be determined, but a small error here is of little con-
sequence. The change in the value of L (when L is the latent heat of evaporation of
graven) i is small as compared with the changes in @. In fact, an accuracy of an order
Qf 4! yo of a degree would be sufficient when determining the actual elevation.

8 The heat was supplied to the calorimeter by means of a wire whose ends were kept
St a constant potential difference. The thermal balance could be maintained in one
or two ways,

n

= (1) If the heat supply was too great, the electric current could be temporarily
ic stopped : or, the rate of evaporation of the water increased. (The latter was
2 the method that I generally adopted.)
