laterally, the external auditory meatus remains short, and in correspondence with this
the post-tympanic squamosal is not so broad nor the exoccipital splayed out in such a
broad shoulder behind it.

One noteworthy feature of the Montauban fragment of Miztotherium is the very great
thickness of the post-tympanic process of the squamosal. It is true that in those Anthra-
cotheres where the postglenoid compression is not so great—as for instance, in Brachyo-
dus Gorringei—it is a fairly thick plate, but the shoulder of exoccipital pressed forwards
behind it towards the tympanic neck is always of greater importance. Here, however,
instead of being as there a wide plate, it is a very thick pillar widely separating the
paroccipital and the tympanic neck. A stout post-tympanic process of the squamosal
is probably a primitive feature,* and the fact that it is much less massive in the smaller
species of Miztotherium in Paris, which in nearly all its other characters is more primitive
than the Montauban skull, may be attributed to the Paris skull being altogether smaller
and less massive, with occipital and zygomatic crests far less strongly developed, and
the postglenoid as well as the post-tympanic process less powerful.

In the Montauban fragment some of the oto-glenoid characters are so much better
shown than in the skull figured by Srenixy that I will give a short description of them
here.

The postglenoid process is very long and pendent, rather narrow, but thick at the
tip. Between it and the tympanic neck is a very narrow groove which leads medially
into a small postglenoid foramen.t | This groove corresponds to the one described above
