S of detachable ſactors, becomes then the distinct object of the inquiry, and will, of
2 course, depend only upon the coefficients in P and Q and the nature of the arbitrary
E continuous or discontinuons function @(:), which regulates the number of steps
£ through which each snccessive process of division is to be pursued. Following out
DS this idea in a particular case, if we again reduce to our two initial functions the forms
s previously employed, and write

A V=b"+6b,.z""+&c.;
and if, instead of making, according to the more usual course of proceeding, the
divisions proceed first throngh one step and ever after through two steps at a time
which is tantamount to making p1=1 @(1+s)=2, we push each division through one
step only at a time, and no more (80 that in fact p(i) is always 1), we sball baye
