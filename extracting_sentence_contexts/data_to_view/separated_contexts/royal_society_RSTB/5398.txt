We mention these points in order to make it quite clear that in the present paper
we are not dealing with these lower horizons. None of the plants we have as yet seen
from them are determinable, though some are of striking size and appearance. The
present description of some well-characterised and determinable fossil plants from a
higher horizon in the Walhalla Series, that of the Centennial Beds, is a contribution of
fact, which will require to be taken into consideration along with data regarding the
animal fossils in dealing with the stratigraphical question as a whole. There appears to be general agreement that strata in a number of localities where
fossil plants are relatively abundant are situated high in the Walhalla Series. This
applies to the Centennial Mines, the beds at Wood’s Point and those at Gaffney’s
Creek, from all of which specimens were recorded in our earlier paper.
