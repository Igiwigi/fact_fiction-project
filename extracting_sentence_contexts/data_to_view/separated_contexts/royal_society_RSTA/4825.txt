The fine spinels, nearly an inch in diameter, are found with their surfaces showing
the incipient alteration to which I have referred. In these cases, it would seem that
the growth of the spinel crystals and their partial alteration by solvent action going
on irregularly over their surfaces, must both have been accomplished before the
deposition of the calcite in which they are now found to be completely embedded. In
the case of the Mogok limestones, however, the fact that the unaltered rubies are seen
ving in the midst of a mass of their alteration products, the whole being enclosed in
the limestone, seems to prove conclusively that the changes took place after the
ormation of the latter rock.—-October 7, 1895]. n VIlIl.—Summary ov Resvrrs. 6
