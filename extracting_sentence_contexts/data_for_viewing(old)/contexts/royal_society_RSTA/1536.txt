Measured in aggregate floating-point operations per second, scaled so that the IBM 701 machine equals 1. Epochs (scalar, vector,
parallel, scalable) show the dominant technology of the time. Landmark advances in climate science are shown. The green

of simulated ‘neurons’ to mimic processing in the human brain. The brain does in fact make use
of massive parallelism but with slow ‘clock speeds’. While the initial excitement around neural
networks in the 1960s (e.g. the ‘perceptron’ model of [9]) subsided as progress stalled due to the
computational limitations of the time, these methods have undergone a remarkable resurgence
in many scientific fields in recent years, as the algorithms underlying learning models are ideally
suited to today’s hardware for arithmetic. While the meteorological community may have initially
been somewhat reticent (for reasons outlined in [10]), the last 2 or 3 years have witnessed a great
efflorescence of the literature applying machine learning (ML)—as it is now called—in Earth system
science. This special issue itself is evidence.

We argue in this article that this represents a sea change in computational Earth system science
that rivals the von Neumann revolution. Indeed, some of the debates around ML today—pitting
‘model-free’ methods against ‘interpretable AI’> for example—recapitulate those that took place
