have covered to some depth. Adhering to the face of this precipice, I found the
circular supports of many large Balani, Some of these supports (see Plate IF.
figs.38,39.) were three quarters of an inch in diameter ; and being white, they spotted
the rock, 80 as to present at a distance exactly the appearance of lichens. I also
found in horizontal clefts between the rocks pendent barnacles, fixed to the roof 80
firmly that I was able to break off pieces of the hard gneiss on which the shells still
remained attached. In some places small zoophytes (Cellepora? Lan.) were ad-
hering to the rock or to the Balani; and I also found some of the Cellepores with
the support of the Balani partially covering them. These corals and adhering shells,
therefore, must have grown upon the gneiss before the accumulation of drift shells
had filled up this valley, once a submarine hollow. I had always imagined that the
shelly formations near Uddevalla resembled ancient beaches of the ocean which had
been upraised, but they are in fact stratified formations of sand, clay, and gravel, and
in several places almost entirely of shells, which have filled up at some former period
the deep bays and fiords of a sea like that now bounding this coast. The quantity
and variety of the shells at Capellbacken, Kured, and Bricke reminded me of the
deposits of Grignon and Damerie in the Paris basin ; but it is curious to reflect, that

althongh the shells are almost equally well preseryed in both these regions, they are

specifically s0 distinct, that in the one it is scarcely possible to find a recent species,

while in the other nearly all, perhaps every one of the species, belong to the German

Ocean. The list of the shells which I collected here in one day will be found at the
