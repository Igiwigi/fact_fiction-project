the respiration, and the degree of irritability of the heart : if either be unduly
augmented, a destructive state of the functions is induced ; if either be unduly
diminished, the vital functions languish and eventually cease. If the bird
possessed the degree of irritability of the reptile tribes, or the latter the quan-
tity of respiration of the former, the animal frame would soon wear out. If,
on the contrary, the bird were reduced to the quantity of respiration appro
priate to the reptile, or the latter to the degree of irritability which obtains in
the former, the functions of life would speedily become extinct. Various de-
viations from the usual proportion between the respiration and the irritability,
however, occur, but there is an immediate tendency to restore that propor-
tion ; increased stimulus exhausts or lowers the degree of irritability, whilst
diminished stimulus allows of its augmentation. The alternations between
activity and sleep afford il]astrations of these facts.

Changes in anatomical form in the animal kingdom present other illustra-
tions of the law of the inverse proportion of the respiration and irritability.


WHICH SUBSISTS BETWEEN THE RESPIRATION AND IRRITABILITY. 323

The egg, the foetus, the tadpole, the larya, &c. are respectively animals of
lower respiration, and of higher irritability, than the same animals in their
mature and perfect state. Changes in physiological condition also illustrate
the same law. The conditions of lethargy, and of torpor, present examples of
lower respiration, and of higher irritability, than the state of activity.
