Mor-
TENSEN (18), in his recent review of the echinoderm larvee, has suggested the names
echinopluteus and ophiopluteus for the larve of Echinoidea and Ophi-
uroidea respectively, and the name echinopluteus will be used throughout this
paper. JOHANNES Miruer described eight or nine types ‘of’ echinopluteus, one of
which is certainly to be identified with the larva of #. miliaris, The stages which
he observed ranged from’ the four-armed larva to the larva which was just about to
metamorphose, in which the first tube feet and spines of the adult were already
formed, and he drew the conclusion that he was dealing with the larva of an
echinoid, from the fact that in the suckers of these tube feet were embedded
eulcareous plates. In his figures and descriptions, MUtuer invariably placed the
posterior pole of the larva upwards and the preeoral lobe downwards, so that it is
necessary to reverse his orientation in order to get a correct idea of the natural
relationships of the parts of the larva. His description of the external features of
the development is beautifully exact, and he made the discovery that the future oral
dise of the Echinus develops on the floor of a pit of invaginated skin, the opening of
which becomes closed.
