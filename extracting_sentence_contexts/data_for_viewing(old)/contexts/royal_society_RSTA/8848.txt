as before. The pressure falls from 3316-0 kg./em.? at the breech to 3304-3 kg./em.?
at the junction. A long process is required to find the pressure in the first reflected
wave. Writing » = (r—R,)/S,; and 3 = (s—S8,)/S,, at the base of the projectile
¢» = B,S+B,s*+...+B,6° is a known function of 6. We expand the formule of
Article 20 to give t+h/a, «, and (Z—K,—L,u)/%, explicitly in terms of ¢ and 4, and
try different values of 3 until ¢ has its required value 0-002898. Then the pressure at

the base of the projectile is known, and also its velocity and final position. For other
points % and 3 have to be found to make both «, and ¢ correct : the adjustment is facili-
tated by the fact that uniform division of #, corresponds approximately to uniform
division of ¢. At the junction (x, = 4c) ¢ = 0, and at the base of the projectile (x, = 0)
@ = —0-019578. Taking four values of ¢ equally spaced between these, and finding
3 to give the correct t, we have four points which correspond nearly to 10, 20, 30 and
40 per cent. division of the initial gas, and are easily adjusted to exact value by inter-
polation. The pressure falls from 3304-3 kg./em.” at the junction to 2970-3 kg./em.?
at the base of the projectile. The projectile is displaced 75-4 cm. from its seat, and
has velocity 466-2 m./sec.

(Plate 1, curve 6).—-The first reflected wave reaches the breech at time t = 0-003859
sec., where the pressure is 2610-5 kg./em.? Other points are found as in the last para-
graph. ‘The pressure at the base of the projectile is 2161-6 kg./em.*, the displacement
of the projectile 124-3 cm., and its velocity 550-4 m./sec.
