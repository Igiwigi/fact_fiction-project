SOME OBSERVATIONS ON WELWITSCHIA MIRABILIS. 273

profusion in which the cones, especially those of the male plant, are produced, is in
marked contrast with the slow growth of the stock. In Mossamedes, where the
leaves are used by the natives for fuel, the plants are said to flower for some time
after the leaves have been torn off.* A considerable age is probably attained before
flowering commences. it
That Welwitschia is dicecious seems to have been first recorded by Martoru.{ The
fact may, however, be stated again, as authors are either doubtful or convey the
idea that it is monecious.{ In Portuguese territory, according to Baum,§ the male
plants are more numerous than the female in the proportion of two or three to one. Of the plants seen at Haikamchab on January 12, I thought the males were more |
numerous. Forty-two examined on January 13 included 16 males (one a graft
of two or more), 18 females, one dead, and seven whose sex was not noted.
