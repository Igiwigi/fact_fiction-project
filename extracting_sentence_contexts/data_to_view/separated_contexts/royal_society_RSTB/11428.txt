implies that early humans acquired this from observing how animals and
fellow-humans could be killed. But this hardly seems probable. The fact is
most of the ways you might observe to be effective for killing another—be it
with teeth or claws or fists or clubs—would not be feasible ways for you to kill
yourself. Instead, for most of human history (until the advent of modern
murder weapons such as guns), a more likely model for suicide will have been
accidental death: falling from a cliff, drowning in a lake and bleeding to death
from a cut. By imagining yourself in the victim’s place, you would see that
what happened to him or her by accident could happen to you by your own
intent.
