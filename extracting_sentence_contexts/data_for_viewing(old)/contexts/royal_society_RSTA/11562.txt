For the reasons stated, it seems necessary to seek the cause of the ionisation
within the surface layer of the metal. On the molecular theory a metal, and in fact
any solid, will possess a surface layer in which the molecules are more loosely held
together than in the interior. On account of the well-known tenacity with which
films of gas adhere to solid bodies, it seems reasonable to suppose that this layer will
be capable of being penetrated by the surrounding gas, and that when equilibrium is
established the absorbed gas will have a density which is very great compared with
that of the free gas outside. This comes to assuming that a gas molecule loses
potential energy when it enters the surface layer. To explain the results it is
necessary to assume, in addition, that, for reasons connected with the structure of the
metal, only dissociated oxygen atoms and not the ordinary molecules are capable of
entering the surface layer. This assumption receives some support from the fact
that the hydrogen which diffuses through hot platinum has been shown to be in the
atomic form.* In order to make the problem definite we shall suppose the surface
layer to be only a few atoms thick, and that each platinum atom is capable of
retaining one oxygen atom in its immediate neighbourhood. The problem, then,
reduces to what is virtually the determination of the condition of chemical equilibrium.
Let the maximum concentration of the free platinum, 7.c., the concentration when no
gas is present, reckoned as so much per unit area, be = a, and let the concentration
of the platinum which is used up by retaining its sufficient quotum of gas at time
t=«a, Then the concentration of the free platinum at time t=a—a. Let the
external gas pressure = P, then the pressure of the dissociated oxygen = p, where p

is given by the quadratic ,
