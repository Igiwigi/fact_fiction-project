the first term, alone exists; or we may assume that the ether is more or less carried
along by the earth, in which case @= ¢, and the second term attains its maximum
value, 448, when the angle is 45°. But even if « is as great as 8, the most favourable
case, unless the ether has a proper motion of its own, this only means a discrepancy
in a star’s absolute position of *001”; so it is hopeless to look for a motion of the
medium this way.

50. The experiment of filling «a telescope tube with water as suggested by
Boscovicn, and tried by Arry, and more exactly by Horx,* aims at a motion quite
different from that above contemplated. It aims at moving a portion only of the
ether in a partitioned-off region of space. It is easy to show that on FREsNEL's
theory no different aberrational effect can be thus observed than is observed with an
air telescope ; in fact, FrusNeL himself, in his original letter to ARaco (§ 4) contem-
plated this experiment, and predicted its negative result, but it may be instructive to

enter on its consideration in a geometrical fashion.

Kifect of Motion combined with Change of a Portion of the Medium.

So long as the whole medium is changed or moved, we have seen what effect there is
on aberration. Motion has no effect on it, it drifts the wave-normals but cannot affect
the rays; increased » without motion increases it. But if the ray has to pass through
a bounding surface, and if the change or motion occurs only on one side of that
