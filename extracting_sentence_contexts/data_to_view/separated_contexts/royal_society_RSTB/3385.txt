The geographical evidence is therefore not opposed
to the view that the floras to which the African Gneta and Welwitschia respectively
belong are descended from the same phytogeographical stock. At the same time, the
physical geography of the coastal area of Damaraland,|| together with the unique
characters of the dominant elements of its flora, indicate that the conditions which
have led to its differentiation have persisted through an enormously long period. The fact that Welwitschia diverges so widely in its external characters, as probably
also in the details of its reproduction, from species which, for geographical reasons,
may be supposed to be more nearly related to it than any other living plants, is
therefore not remarkable. If forms intermediate between Gnetwm Gnemon and
Welwitschia still exist, they are to be looked for in G. Bucholzianum and
