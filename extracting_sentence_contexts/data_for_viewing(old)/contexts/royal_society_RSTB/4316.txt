extent, in the first epoch, but the chief evidence for their existence in London is
found in the second epoch, to which they contribute the main epidemic periodicity.

amplitude is found for a three years period in the middle epoch, and a considerable
amplitude in the earliest epoch, but, again, no evidence for such a period exists
during the last 75 years. Considering the whole of the facts, it would seem that the
influence of the changes in the solar year in determining epidemics of measles is not
nearly so direct as has been supposed.

The almost exact coincidence of the periods in many places with one year or two
years suggests, however, that the variation of the seasons may have played a part
in the evolution of the life-history of the measles organism, and that, at the present
moment, the apparent influence of the solar year is the result not of present but of
past action.

The conclusions which may be based on the results of this investigation cannot in
