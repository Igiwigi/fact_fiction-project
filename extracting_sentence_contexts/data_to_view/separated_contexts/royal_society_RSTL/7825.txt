It will be observed that at the stern the curve of
Suoyancy DD in fig. 2 is ended at some distance before the curye of total weight W W ;
he same thing, although in a less prominent degree, is observable in fig. 1. The over-
ang of the stern above water is the cause of this method of ending the curves; and in
he *Minotaur* the distance between the points where they terminate is greater than in
he © Victoria and Albert,” because she is a larger ship and has a screw-propeller.
2 My third illustration is taken from the * Bellerophon,' for which ship the curves of
Hal weight, weight of hull, and buoyancy shown in fig. 3 have been constructed in the
"Manner previously described for the * Victoria and Albert,” 'This case may be taken as
=] representative of the distribution of weight and buoyancy in iron-clads of moderate
Jength and proportions, with central batteries and armour-belts, and with a fall-back
Stem. The advantages of this bow in giving increased buoyancy are well illustrated by
She fact that the foremost water-borne section R' R* in Plate XVI. fig. 3 is only 40 feet
From the bow, and that the excess of weight over buoyancy on this length is only 45 tons. An the * Minotaur,” as we have seen, the foremost water-borne section is 80 feet from the
Sow, and the excess of weight on this length is 420 tons. Part of this difference is un-
-Aloubtedly due to the different arrangement of the armour of the two ships; but as the
Bellerophon ' has an armoured bow-battery about 20 feet long, in wake of which the
-rmour-plating reaches up to the height of the upper deck, and as the * Bellerophon's
ught of water is much less, forward, than that of the * Minotaur,” it will be obvious
That the very different form of the bows greatly influences the case.
