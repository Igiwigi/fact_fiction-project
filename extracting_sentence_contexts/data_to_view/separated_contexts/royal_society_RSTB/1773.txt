and the Hensen Expedition, accompanied by a botanist (Dr. Scutrr) skilled in the
minute examination of such organisms, though it accomplished great things, still left —
a legacy of doubts on many points, and in fact proclaimed more loudly than ever the —
richness of this field of investigation,

The method of collection was to pump a steady stream of sea-water through fine
silk nets. We employed No. 20 miller’s silk by three different makers, and though
there were at first differences in capacity of these silks for stopping organisms, they —
soon became fairly equal with use. It has been assumed in making estimates of the
amount of plankton that No, 20 silk practically stops all organisms, or at least with a
degree of error that may be calculated.
