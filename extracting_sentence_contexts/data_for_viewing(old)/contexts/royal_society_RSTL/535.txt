two results. We may, consequently, take 1036334 feet, for the
distance required.

I have observed, in a former part of this account, that the
zenith sector was placed 6+ feet from the station at Dunnose,
and 34 feet from that at Clifton, the new points being due
south of the old. We must therefore add g feet to 1036934;
which gives 1096337 feet, for the total length of the arc of the
meridian.

The sum of the parallels to the meridian of Clifton, reaching
down to Arbury Hill, is 4500477,z feet; and the distance of the
latter from that meridian 1996 feet. This is, in fact, the meri-
dional extent between the two old stations, as no correction is
requisite. We must, however, subtract go feet from this distance,
as the sector was put up 34+ feet northward of the station on
Arbury Hill. Therefore, 450047,5 â€” go = 450017,5 feet, is the
length of the arc comprized between the parallels of the new
stations at Clifton and Arbury Hill : and, subtracting this from
1036937, we have g86319,5 feet, for the distance of this latter
station from the point over which the sector was placed at
Dunnose.

Aithough the zenith sector was taken to the Royal Obser-
vatory at Greenwich, rather with a view of collecting materials
