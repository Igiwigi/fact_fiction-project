lamine no such film exists, probably in consequence of the interval of time between
their formation being too short ; and between others the film has been formed of un-
equal thickness, as happens in the oxidations upon steel when they are formed upon
or around hard parts of the metal called pins by the workmen.

'There can be no doubt that these iridescent films are formed when the dash-wheel
is at rest during the night, and that when no film exists between two lamine, an in-
terval too short for its formation (arising perhaps from the stopping of the work
during the day,) has elapsed during the drying or induration of the one lamina and
the deposition of the other.

That these iridescent films are not thin films of the substance itself, may be inferred
from the fact that light is reflected from their surfaces when they firmly adhere to
the laminze which inclose them. If, for example, we remove or raise up from a piece
of mica. a thin film which gives a bright green tint, and press it again into optical
contact with the surface from which it was separated, it will then cease to exhibit
any colour, because no light is reflected from its posterior surface ; but if we press it
into optical contact with another surface which has a different refractive power, its
green colour will still be exhibited. It is owing to this cause that the colours of the
oxidations on steel are 80 distinctly visihle, and that the analogous oxidations are
seen upon glass even before the film has begun to separate into coloured scales.

The iridescent films in the new substance possess another source of interest, in 80
far as they promise to throw a new light on the origin of the incommunicable colours
of mother-of-pearl, which arise from the interior structure of the shell, and which
