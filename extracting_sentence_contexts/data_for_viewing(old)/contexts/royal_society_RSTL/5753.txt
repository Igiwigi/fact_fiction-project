S Notwithstanding these facts, we were not prepared for the curious results which we

E obtained with the following bar, composed of two longitudinal bars of tin soldered to
3 two of copper and placed in juxtaposition (see Plate XXVII. bar No. 4); for although
it contained in 100 parts the same weight of tin and copper as the last bar, it con-
ducted heat at quite a different rate ; in fact, its conductibility was the same as if the bar
was entirely composed of pure copper, and did not contain half its bulk of tin.
