As discussed above, AMP genes—especially in the arthropods—
typically change more slowly than other genes of the immune
system. One possible explanation for this conservation is stabi-
lizing selection [39], which among other things, might be
mediated by the action of AMPs in concert with other AMPs
and other immune effectors. Yet AMPs do not act only as
immune effectors; therefore, AMPs are presumably under
concurrent, pleiotropic selection for being able to fulfil their
different roles. In vertebrates [11] and to a lesser extent in
crustaceans [17], AMPs are also immune-modulators and
have anti-inflammatory properties or contribute to wound heal-
ing. Thus, while research on AMPs has mostly focused on their
antimicrobial properties in the context of pathogens (a fact that
might partly be ascribed to the history of their discovery [4]), in
many multicellular organisms, AMPs have other functions.
They can be important mediators of interactions with commen-
sal or mutualistic bacteria, on both an ecological as well as
evolutionary scale. This aspect has not been sufficiently studied,
but informative work has been done in the tsetse fly, Glossina
[84], mosquitoes [85] or in Rhodnius, the vector of Chagas
disease [86]. AMPs are part of the regulatory chain that pre-
pares, activates or supports the immune response, and
thereby interactions with the microbiota seem essential.

The gut harbours a microbiota whose number—at least
