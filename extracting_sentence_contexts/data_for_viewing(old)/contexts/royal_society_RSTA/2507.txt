60% came from federal aid, which may have been quicker. In both countries, the economy had
recovered to near normal within 12-18 months.

Comparing the speed of recovery in different sectors, experts in the UK and Germany
consider that employment and infrastructure recovered more rapidly than housing, although the
differences were not that pronounced.

(b) Changes in resilience

Only a small proportion of residents in the UK (29%) and Germany (26%) believe that their homes
are now safer and better prepared than prior to the flood. The majority of people surveyed in both
countries (74% in Germany and 67% in the UK) believe that their homes and businesses are as just
as vulnerable now as they were before the respective floods. This reflects the fact that most homes
were repaired without the addition of any flood protection or damage alleviation measures. By
contrast, half the respondents in the UK (50%) thought their neighbourhood was safer and better
prepared compared to only 11% in Germany, where 86% thought their neighbourhood or town
was just as vulnerable. In the UK, the survey was conducted in an area where the Environment
Agency has installed major flood protection measures since 2007.

(c) Were the floods ‘gamechangers’

Extreme events can be catalysts for policy change and both floods provoked significant changes
in flood awareness and preparedness [87,88]. In the UK, the 2007 flood was called a ‘game
changer’ and in Germany the 2013 flood in Germany was described as a ‘focusing event’ [89].
It is fair to conclude that both floods may be considered as ‘game-changers’ and resulted in a
