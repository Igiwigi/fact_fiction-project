have any real connection with the earthquakes they appear to refer to, or are due to
other, possibly local, disturbances which happened to coincide approximately with
the greater earthquake.

On the one hand the number of cases in which there is an early commencement
of the record seems too great for the connection to be fortuitous. Excluding the
second Turkestan shock, where the record began at Ischia and Catania about 13
minutes before the earthquake, and the disturbance may well be attributed to some
other cause, we have no less than five out of ten distinct shocks, in which there
is a commencement of the record in advance of the disturbance of what I have
called first phase. .

On the other hand there is the want of accordance in the times, and the fact that
the early commencement was in each case only found at a single station; as these
are about evenly divided between the light and heavy pendula, there is no guide as
to the nature of the disturbance.

If due to the principal shock and not to local disturbances, these early commence-
ments of the record can hardly be attributed to any form of wave motion set up by,
and at the same time as, the earthquake. They would, in this case, have to be
attributed to premonitory disturbances of a nature very different to that of the
main shock, for, though unfelt in the neighbourhood of the origin, the initial energy
of the disturbance would have to be great enough to affect instruments at distances
ranging from one ninth to one quarter of the circumference of the earth.
