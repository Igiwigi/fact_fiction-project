Further, it seemed as though the discordant results
of various authors who had worked on the same hybrids might be explained by the
fact that under certain conditions the male pronucleus was functional, while under
other conditions it was not. In the former case an “intermediate” type of larvee would be expected, and in
the latter only those of the “maternal” type. The fact that we obtained only
“maternal ” larvee from certain crosses during three years’ work led us to investigate
the phenomena of fertilization very carefully. As a result of this work we have
found that in every hybrid with which we have worked a true fusion of the male and
female pronuclei occurs in every egg which develops. A complete cytological study
of eggs taken from the same batches as those from which the hybrids themselves
were reared has shown that there is absolutely no doubt that a true zygote nucleus is
invariably formed. :

These results, together with those of Banrzer (who worked with the same species
as did earlier workers, such as Sreticer, Drimscn, Vernon, etc.), show that the
