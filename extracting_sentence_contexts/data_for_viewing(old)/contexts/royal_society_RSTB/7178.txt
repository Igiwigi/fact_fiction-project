(a) The initial phase of leaf formation

In standard works on the morphology of leptosporangiate ferns (de Bary 1884; Bower
1923 ; Campbell 1940; Sifton 1944), the leaf is described as originating from a single enlarged
cell of the apical meristem and, indeed, unless a close examination of the apex is made, this
appears to be the case. Accordingly, it has been held that in its origin the fern leaf differs
notably from the leaves of flowering plants. In them, the leaf primordium consists of
a mound-like outgrowth of the shoot, a considerable number of cells being involved. In
dicotyledons, the first evidence of leaf formation consists of periclinal divisions in the sub-
epidermal layer; in monocotyledons, the first divisions are periclinal divisions in the outer
layer. Ifit is true that the leaf primordium in leptosporangiate ferns is entirely the product
of a single cell then the process of leaf formation in ferns and of flowering plants is quite
different from the outset. Nevertheless, the evident fact is that the leaves in the two groups
have much in common. Considerations such as these have led the writer to undertake
a reinvestigation of the earliest stages of leaf formation in D. aristata.

The method adopted was as follows: Apices were laid bare as already described and the
positions of J,, P,, P,, P;, P,and P; observed. Each apex was then dissected longitudinally
so that a thin slice of tissue, including the apical cell and either the position J, or primordium
P, or P,, was obtained (figure 1). These materials were fixed, embedded in wax and
sectioned longitudinally. The results are illustrated in figures 21 to 29 and figures 73 to 78,
plate 29.

A median longitudinal section through the apical cell and position J, is illustrated semi-
diagrammatically in figure 21. The prism-shaped meristematic cells (m—m’') extend well
