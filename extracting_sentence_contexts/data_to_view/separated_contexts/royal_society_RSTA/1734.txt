The Nova Technical Contract and the following experiments performed
in the beginning of the 1990s defined the baseline of the NIF laser [20,41]. In accordance with
the available laser technologies and envisioned costs of a behemoth 5 MJ laser, the laser energy
was downscaled to 2MJ with some margins for ignition. In fact, prior to the National Ignition
Campaign (NIC) [21], 2D radiation hydrodynamics simulations were still predicting high fusion
gain with less than 2 MJ in indirect drive [42,43]. Nowadays, the most accurate 3D radiation
hydrodynamics capsule only simulations are used to extrapolate performances of moderate
convergent implosions with 5 MJ of laser energy [44,45]. One could also note that revisions of
the metrics and definition of gain and ignition known as generalized Lawson criterion [46] have
emerged recently, as summarized in a recent review [47]

This historical background is not a criticism, as the above-mentioned papers were based
on state-of-the art experiments, diagnostics and simulations of their time.
