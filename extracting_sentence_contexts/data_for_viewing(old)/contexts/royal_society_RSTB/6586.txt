The larva of Phronia annulata differs from that of P. strenua in having a larger head,
better developed prothoracic and abdominal spiracles, and a different number of the
papillae and teeth borne on its labrum, mandibles, and maxillae. Moreover, it is
easily distinguished from P. strenua by having the dorsal surface covered with spinules
and by not carrying an excremental test. The two species of Phronia described are
unlike all other Mycetophilid larvae in the shape of their body, which is slug-like.
This is probably a secondary adaptation to their environment, for the larvae live on
fallen branches which are liable to become dry. As all Mycetophilid larvae require
a saturated atmosphere for respiration, the body of Phronia is shortened to enable the
larva to withstand adverse conditions, thus exposing less cuticular surface and so
preventing excessive evaporation. That this shortening is a secondary adaptation
is supported by the fact that the alimentary canal, which is straight in all other
Mycetophilid larvae, is coiled on itself in Phronia (fig. 318). Moreover, Phronia
annulata is provided with spinulae on the dorsal surface and short hairs in the vicinity
of the spiraclesâ€”a unique condition in Mycetophilid larvae and possibly an adapta-
tion to reduce surface evaporation. Phronia strenua carries an excremental test
which may serve a similar purpose. In both species skin respiration is reduced, but
spiracular respiration is increased, as evidenced by the well-developed spiracles.
Hotmecren described hypodermal glands in M. ancyliformans. The function of such

glands is probably to cover the body with an oily secretion and thus reduce surface
evaporation.
