There remain, however, physical considerations as to
the effect of variations of the speed and load on « and þ which have to be taken into

208 PROFESSOR O. REYNOLDS ON THE THEORY OF LUBRICATION

30.—p and a are only to be inferred from the experiments,

The equations of the las section give directly the friction, the intensity of pressure,
and the distance between the eylindrical surfaces, when the velocity, the radii of
curvature of the journal and the brass, the length of the brass, and the manner of
| loading are known (1.e., when U, BR, a, 0, L, and p are known) ; and, further, if M the

moment of friction is known, the equations afford the means of determining « when þ
is known, or p when @ is known,

S The quantities U, R, 0, and L are of a nature to be easily determined in any experi-
= ment or actual case, and M is easily measured in special experiments, but with @ and
E þ ib is different,
- By no known means can the difference of radii («) of the journal and its brass be
= determined to one ten-thousandth part of an inch, and this would be necessary in
= order to obtain a precise value of a. As a matter of fact eyen a rough measurement
'S of @ is impossible. To determine a, therefore, it is necessary to know the moment of
= friction or the distribution of pressure ; then if the value of p be known by experi-
Z ments 8uch as those described for olive oil (Section II.), a can be deduced from the
be equations for any particular value of p. But although the values of y may have been
E determined for all temperatures for the particular oil used, and that value chosen
5 which corresponds with the temperature of the oil bath in the experiment, the ques-
= tion still arises whether the oil bath (or wherever the temperature is measured) is at
= the same temperature as the oil film, Considering the thinness of the film and the
S rapid conduction of heat by metal surfaces, ib seemed at firs sight reasonable to
| Z assume that there would be no great difference, but, when on applying the equations
E to determine the value of a for one of the journals and brasses used in Mr, TowR's
<= experiments, it was found that the different experiments did not give the same values
SZ for a, and that the calculated values of a increased much faster with the velocity when
8 the load was constant than with the load when the velocity was constant, ib 8eemed
E probable that the temperature of the oil film must have yaried in a manner unper-
= ceived, increasing with the velocity and diminishing the viscosity, which would

account for an apparent increase of a,

That a should increage with the load was to be expected, considering that the
material of both journal and brass are elastic, and that the loads range up to as much
as 600 lbs, per square inch, but there does not appear any reason why @ should
increase with the velocity unless there is an increase of temperature in the metal.
