It is then readily found that A, satisfies the equation
curl curl A, — grad log vzacurl A, + AnxuA, +peA, = 0. (2, 10) If the field varies sufficiently slowly, the displacement current D/4m will be small
and ¢ will be approximately non-divergent. In fact D may be neglected in equation
(2, 2) if it is small enough compared with either ¢ or curlH. When the field is oscil-
latory with a period of order T, D is of order ¢E/T and ¢ of order «E, so that

Dec if T>e/k. (2,11)
If this condition is satisfied the medium will behave like an ordinary conductor. In
electromagnetic units ¢ is of order ¢~*, where ¢ = 3°10" cm.sec.', so that even if'« is as
small as 10>2° e.m.u., 7 has only to be greater than a few seconds. Ina dielectric, D may still be ignored if it is small compared with curl H.
