d 7. On Dynamic Radiation and Absorption.

Both the source of heat and the compensating cube were dispensed with, and the
thermo-electric pile was presented to the end of the cold experimental tube. By a little
management, the slight inequality of radiation against both faces of the pile, arising
from differences in the various parts of the laboratory, was obliterated, and the needle of
the galvanometer thus brought to 02.

The vapours were admitted in the manner already described, until a tension of 0:5 of an
inch was obtained. The air was then allowed to enter through a drying apparatus by an
orifice of a constant magnitude. Two stopcocks, in fact, were introduced between the dry-
ing-tube and the experimental tube ; one of these was kept partially turned on, and formed
the gauge for the admission of the air. When the tube was to be exhausted, the second
stopcock was turned quite off. When the tube was to be filled, this stopcock was turned
full on; but the gauge-cock was never touched during the entire series of experiments.

Before, however, the mode of experiment was thus strictly arranged, a few preliminary
trials gave me the following results:â€” ;
