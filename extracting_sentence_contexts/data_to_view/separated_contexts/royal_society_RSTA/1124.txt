In general,
this is because of the large volume of air into which the pollutants have been dispersed compared
with the surface area (or air volume) to which any potential post-emission abatement technology
may be applied. There are other examples of analysis of mitigation effectiveness at an urban scale recently
reviewed by the UK Air Quality Expert group. From that analysis of a wide range of AQ case
studies [39], they identified the following needs:

— Extensive measurements; as the increased amount of data will generally improve the
overall statistical power of the analysis.

— Monitoring of activity data as this provides important bounds.

— Predicting outcomes, as it is necessary to make predictions of the interventions (or the
counter-factual) for the purposes of contextualizing results and hypothesis testing.

— Taking account of meteorology; as meteorology is a major controlling factor
in AQ.

high priority nationally and internationally integrate it into country and city planning processes.
