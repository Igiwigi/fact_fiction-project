Table XXXII., can we conclude that homotyposis is least intense for such organisms,
for the second half of our table cannot be said to contain more of such organisms than
the first. Shortly, I see no relation between the position of an organism in the
evolutionary descent and the intensity of either its variability or its homotyposis.
Hence it follows that, if homotyposis be the source of heredity, the intensity of the
latter cannot be related to either variability or position in evolutionary descent.

Mr, ApAM SEDGWICK may be right in his view* that in the early stages of evolution
variability is large and inheritance small, and that with development this relation is
changed, variability decreasing with an increasing intensity of heredity. My
statistics only cover a small portion of one kingdom. But so far as I am aware
they represent the only material so far published on which a definite judgment can be
founded—where by definite judgment, I mean one based on quantitative facts, and
not drawn from a general estimate of nature which makes no statement whatever
of the intensity of either variability or heredity for any single character in any one
species of living things.

The data I have given seem entirely opposed to Mr. Sepe¢wick’s view, but I very
fully realise that they are far from exhaustive. They indicate, however, what
I hold to be the only valid method of approaching any problem in variation or
heredity, 7.¢., laborious statistical collection of actual facts. My statistics may be
insufficient, I would heartily welcome additions to them; or they may be dealt with
fallaciously. Here is the material; let others add to and, if need be, modify the
conclusions. Only let us follow the method so clearly indicated by Darwin himself
in his ‘Cross and Self-fertilisation of Plants ;’ let us cease to propound hypotheses
