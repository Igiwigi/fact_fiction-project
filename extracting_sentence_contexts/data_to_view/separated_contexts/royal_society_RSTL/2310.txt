which Ihad allowed it to fall. It myt not, however, be understood that it is only applicable to this eyepiece,

not a part of the eyepiece, but of the telescope itself: and it is for this reason its
advantages are 80 conspicuous in the application Mr. DoLLoxp has 80 ingeniously
made of it ; for by lengthening the focus before the rays arrive at the eyepiece, the
image is magnified, while the wires retain only their original size. Having thus shown the origin of the negative achromatic lens, I may be allowed
to state the motives and reasonings which guided me in the computation of the
curves, and what appears to me to constitute the advantages it is found to pozess.
