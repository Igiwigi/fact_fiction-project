methods have been given for that purpose for all values of e, and
consequently for all values of a and b. If the coefficients are to
be determined by deriving A, B, from A', B', &c. the best method
to be followed, is that given by Mr. Ivory, who determines the
coefficients, when the index 2m+1= —1, in fact, by integrating
