prophase elongation cease? Is it really completed before pairing begins or is the
chromosome still lengthening during zygotene?

That such an apparently simple question should still be unanswered is symptomatic
of our ignorance regarding these much studied processes. Far larger problems remain.
Why, for instance, should a twisted shape be the unstressed state of the chromosome
thread? Why does the equilibrium suddenly become altered during prophases so that
untwisting occurs? What are the chemical influences necessary to produce the changes
of length which seem to precede and to follow chromosome pairing? What is the
physical basis of chromosome movement, which must certainly take place before even
molecular forces of the type visualized could possibly affect behaviour? The only
reply to all this is to confess how little we really know about the physics of the cell.
It is therefore to the facts in this paper rather than to the conclusions that attention
should be directed.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I am glad of this opportunity to express my appreciation of the immense debt
which I, in common with every other worker in the Barker Cryptogamic Laboratory,
owe to the personality of Professor Lang. On this occasion I am also indebted to
Professor Hartree, F.R.S., and Mr Dearden, M.Sc., for advice and help with the
calculations, to Dr Astbury and the Oxford Press for permission to reproduce text-fig. 1,
and to Dr Astbury personally for information and advice.
