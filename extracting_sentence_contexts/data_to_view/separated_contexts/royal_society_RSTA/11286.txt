In connection with §§ 16 to 18 several considerations should be borne in
mind, The change of pressure prior to the stationary stage is gradual. The
circumstances are not analogous to that of a wire suddenly loaded. Thus, the fact
that the fall of reading in a given time is proportional to the pressure range can
hardly be regarded as merely a special case of the ordinary after-effect law. As we
shall see very clearly later, the phenomenon is largely dependent on the way in
which the pressure is reduced. A preliminary stoppage on the way down, or a
change in the rate of reduction of pressure, each exert an important influence ; the
one affecting the magnitude of the fall, the other its law of variation with the time.
