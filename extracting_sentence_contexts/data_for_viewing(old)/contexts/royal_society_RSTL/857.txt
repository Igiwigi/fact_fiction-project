V. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS,

Mr. ProvsT has supposed, in his Paper upon Tannin and
its Species,* that there exist different species of the tanning
principle, possessed of different properties, and different powers

of acting upon reagents, but all precipitable by gelatine. This
opinion is sufficiently conformable to the facts generally known
concerning the nature of the substances which are produced in
organised matter; but it cannot be considered as proved, till the
tannin in different vegetables has been examined in its pure or
insulated state. In all the vegetable infusions which have been
subjected to experiment, it exists in a state of union with other
principles; and its properties must necessarily be modified by
the peculiar circumstances of its combination.

From the experiments that have been detailed it appears, that
the specific agencies of tannin in all the different astringent
infusions are the same. In every instance, it is capable of en-
tering into union with the acids, alkalis, and earths; and of
