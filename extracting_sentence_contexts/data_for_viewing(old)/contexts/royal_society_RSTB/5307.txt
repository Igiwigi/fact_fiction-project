accompanied the various arteries of the head and throat, though everywhere sharply
differentiated from them, without the least indication of open connection.

It was not possible to trace the distribution of every branch in detail, but so far as
they were traced they conformed in their distribution in all essential particulars to those
of the Cod; with, however, the important exception that the hinder epibranchial
branches did not extend backwards along the aorta through the trunk to the tail.



LYMPHATICS IN THE COD (GADUS MORRHUA). 341

Apart from this the findings are, so far as they go, on all fours with the facts observed
in greater detail in the Cod and increase the probability that a system of “ fine”
vessels complementary to the arteries is not an isolated occurrence but is common to
Teleostean Fishes in general.

4. Morphological Status of the“ Fine” Vessel System.

With only the facts furnished by my investigation of Lophius at my disposal, I was
unable to offer any suggestion as to the morphology of the “ fine ** vessels beyond point-
ing out the similarity of their structure to that of small arteries (4, p. 41).

The extension of the system into the caudal region, now observed in the Cod, led me
to investigate more fully than I had done the literature dealing with the vascularisation
