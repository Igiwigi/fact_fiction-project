Thus for thick screens, nickel offers no

anomaly either in the relative intensity of its radiation or in the relative absorption
coefficients of different screens in dealing with its radiation. The anomalous behaviour of nickel with thin screens appears to be due to the fact that
the softer components of its radiation are considerably more penetrating than the softer
components of the radiation from iron; possibly also the question of a different distri-
bution of the rays comes in. Ifa similar result is true for the secondary radiations—and,
judging from the many points of resemblance between the primary and secondary
rays from the same metal, such an assumption would not appear to be altogether
unwarranted—then Messrs. BARKLA and Sapuer’s results can be completely explained. It is worth noticing that Kineman,* working with very hard incident rays (y rays
from radium), found nickel perfectly normal in the intensity of its secondary radiation.
