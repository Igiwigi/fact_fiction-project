If, then, an animal can be placed in such
circumstances that suech motions will certainly not take place, the power of
moving remaining, it may be concluded that volition and the motive influence
of respiration are annihilated. Now this is effected by removing the cerebrum
and the medulla oblongata. These facts are fully proved by the experiments of
Lze6arLors and M. FLoueNs, and by several which I proceed to detail, for the
sake of the opportunity afforded by doing s0, of stating the argument most clearly,

I divided the spinal marrow of a very lively snake (Coluber natriz), between
the second and third vertebrae. The movements of the animal were, immedi-
ately before, extremely vigorous and unintermitted.
