memories are reformed. In §3, we will specifically go into
the question of how the individual as a system relates to the
systemic properties of social interaction.

Let us now turn to the very organization of interaction as
an autonomous system. What are the key features of this
organization, and how do they relate? Both interactional soci-
ology and enaction view the autonomy of social interaction
as arising from the coordination of behaviours. A basic differ-
ence between the two fields is that interactional sociology
approaches the coordination of behaviours in a more structural
way—speaking of structures and practices as normative prin-
ciples that are there, as social facts, prior to any situated
social interaction, while enaction views coordination more in
terms of emergent processes. This different orientation stems
from differences in background and methodology. It is not a
very strict division, and each field also has affinities with the
other’s perspective. Initially, however, interactional sociology
and enactivism differ in terms of their perspectives, prioritizing
either structure or process. Taking this as a basis for discussion
is handy for illuminating how both fields can mutually inform
and enhance each other.

We discuss coordination of behaviour in interaction first
from a more structural perspective, and then from a more
