This
illusion is created by the repetition of a phrase that sounds
initially like speech and through repetition, as if it were
sung. One possible account of this illusion is that the neurons
underlying speech perception get adapted through repe-
tition, whereas the neural population underlying music
perception does not. The robustness of music perception to
neural attenuation may originate from the fact that repetition
is a characterizing feature of music and not of speech [44]. The only fMRI study that has tested the neural correlates
of the song illusion used different phrases, albeit produced by
the same speaker and matched for syllable length, in the
spoken and sung condition [45]. Using such stimuli, it was
found that BOLD responses were larger for speech perceived
as sung than spoken in multiple brain regions, including the
anterior STG and the right midposterior STG.
