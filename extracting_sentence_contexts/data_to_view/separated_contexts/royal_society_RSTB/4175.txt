The semicircular canals in this stage are well de-
veloped and normal. The aquaducius vestibuli (ag.v.) opens immediately behind
the internal meatus (fig. 1), and lies in the same position as in Sphenodon (27). The
internal meatus and the aqueductus vestibuli are confluent in the model, owing
to the fact that the extremely young procartilaginous division has not been
modelled. The fenestra rotunda (fen.7.) faces outwards and backwards. It is hidden in the
lateral view by the overlapping tegmen tympani (t.ty.).
