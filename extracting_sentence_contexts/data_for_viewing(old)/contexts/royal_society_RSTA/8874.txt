UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CHEMICAL ACTION, ll

voltage is at present an entirely arbitrary matter, in default of any knowledge of the
actual contact difference of potential K occurring in any single experiment. The
displacements have, however, been so chosen as to bring the point A (fig. 4), formed by
the intersection of a horizontal line through the standard saturation value unity and
the dotted extension of the straight or slightly concave part FB of the characteristic,
over the zero on the volt scale.

That the point A will not be far from that which corresponds to the condition of zero
electric field between the two electrodes, i.e., V + K = 0, might be anticipated on the
following grounds. The data in fig. 3, and still more in fig. 4, indicate that there is no
considerable direct effect of the applied field in helping the electron emission. In fact,
I have frequently made explicit tests to see if the part DE of the curve slopes upwards,
as appears to be suggested by the points in fig. 4, but I have never been able to convince
myself that it does. Some experiments have given a small increase, some a small
decrease, and others no change with rising voltage. This is a point which deserves
further examination, but if there is any effect * of this kind it is certainly small. It
is presumed, of course, that the voltages used in such tests are not such as to generate
appreciable ionization in the surrounding gas. Inasmuch as the direct effect of the
electric field is negligible, the curving of the part BCD of the characteristic is to be
attributed to such secondary factors as the mutual repulsion of the electrons, electron
reflection at the copper electrode, the return to the drop of some of the emitted electrons
owing to collisions with gas molecules, and the effects of the holes in the copper sphere.
Inasmuch as under ideal conditions in which the electron-emission or saturation current
