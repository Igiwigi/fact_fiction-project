I PROCEED now, according to my promise, to examine, by the great facts
of electrical science, that theory of induction which I have ventured to put forth
(1165. 1295, &c.). The principle of induction is 80 universal that it pervades all
electrical phenomena ; but the general case which I purpose at present to go into
consists of insulation traced into and terminating with discharge, with the accompa-
nying effects, This case includes the various modes of discharge, and also the con-
dition and characters of a current; the elements of magnetic action being amongst
the latter. I shall necessarily have occasion to speak theoretically, and even hypo-
thetically; and though these papers profess to be experimental researches, I hope
that, considering the facts and investigations contained in the last series in support
of the particular view advanced, I shall not be considered as taking too much liberty
on the present occasion, or as departing too far from the character which they onght
to have, especially as I shall use every opportunity which presents itself of returning
to that strong test of truth, experiment.

1319. Induction has as yet been considered in these papers only in cases of insu-
lation ;—opposed to insulation is discharge. The action or effect which may be ex-
pressed by the general term discharge, may take place, as far as we are aware at
present, in several modes.
