As was common practice, the results were widely reported, both in the national
press—The Times of London regularly printed a full list of the successful students—and in the
local press in which often a ‘local hero’ was celebrated. The reports were also syndicated so that
the same report appeared in different local newspapers up and down the country. Several of
the early reports wrongly claimed that Stokes was the first Senior Wrangler from Pembroke, a
fact corrected in later editions. Many too considered the fact that the Senior Wrangler was ‘an
Irishman’ was a point worth making. As it happens, the papers that year had been particularly difficult, which resulted in a high
number of failures among classics students.
