The typical examples are the use of
NR optimization [16], Tikhonov regularization method [19,20] with the techniques of selection of
regularization factors such as the singular value decomposition method and Akaike’s information
criterion [21] and the Marquardt method [22]. The error function is

r= TATAx— TA'b. (2.16)

(iii) One-step methods

One-step method refers the solution from the iterations at the end of the first step of a multi-
step method. It is the fact that the result from the first-step solution normally provides the
most contributive convergence if the regularization factors are properly selected. The quality of
resultant images is generally much better than those came from back-projection approximation
as results from NOSER method [15] and the SCG method [10]. It also runs at a much fast speed
than that of multi-step method owing to the use of the pre-calculated sensitivity matrix.
