Tf in the latter case the stimulus be not too strong, or, better still, if the
Specimen operated on be in a non-yigorous or in a partly anzsthesiated state, it may be
observed that a short interval elapses between the response of the tentacles and that of
the bell. Lastly, the polypite is much more sensitive to a stimulus applied to a tentacle,
or to one of the marginal bodies, than it is to a stimulus applied at any other part of
the nectocalyx*. These facts clearly point to the inference that nervous connexions unite the tentacles
with one another and also with the polypiteâ€”or, perhaps more precisely, that each
marginal body acts as a coordinating centre between nerves proceeding from it in four
directions, viz. to the attached tentacle, to the margin on either side, and to the poly-
pite. This, it will be observyed, is the distribution which TArcktL describes as occurring
in Geryonia, and SCHULTZ as occurring in Sarsiaf.
