breadth and span. :

If we compare the foregoing resuits with the experiments performed by Mr. Hopc-
KINSON on timber, it will be found that the strength of dry English, oak toresist a
crushing force is 424 tons to the square inch, whereas wrought.iron,' accordingto
RoxDeLer, requires a pressure of about 31 tons per square inch, and with this-weight

crushing force is therefore about seven and a quarter times greater.thanthat; of oak :
and, according to. the experiments in the preceding Table, it, appears, that the, resist-
ance of wrought-iron plates to a force calculated to.burst. them, follows; a, different
law to that of oak, the resistance of the former being directly as the depth and-of the
latter as the square of the depth. Reasoning from these facts, it may be! interesting to

ternal pressure increases in the ratio of the squares of its thickness ; and, where great,
strength is required, it will be necessary, in the construction of vessels, to consider
the nature of the service and the required thickness of the planks.

The same remarks will apply to vessels constructed of iron, computed from the
formula deduced from the experiments. In a table of experimental results by Mr.
HovcxrinsoN we have the mean force per square inch required for crusbing timber of
