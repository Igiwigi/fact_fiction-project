For mercury di-n-propyl and di-n-butyl the values 11-6 and 13-7 kcal. respectively are
calculated for the molecular heats of vaporizatiop from the single readings of Cahours
(1873a), Marvel & Gould (1922), Goddard (1923), Jones et al. (1935), Tiffeneau (1921)
and Gilman & Brown (1929). The value for tin tetraethyl is 12-5 kcal. calculated from the
points of Griittner & Krause (1917), Garner & Sugden (1929) and Jones et al. (1935). In the case of aluminium trimethyl, allowance has to be made for the fact that the vapour
is associated. Laubengayer & Gilliam (1941) give 9-6 kcal./mol. for the heat of vaporization
over the range 23 to 70° C, where the vapour is apparently dimeric, and 20-2 kcal. for the
energy of dissociation into two molecules of the monomer. This figure refers to the tempera-
ture range 100 to 156°C, but will scarcely differ at room temperature.
