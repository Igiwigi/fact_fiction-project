as that of the mini black-hole originating from the patching of quantum field theory with general relativity. Thus, the mass
standard is the already mentioned Planck mass. Moreover, from the comparison with the usual free quantum field theory
emerging at large scales (small wave vectors) one finds that the discrete units of time and space are the Planck’s units.

Disclaimer. The fact that the author calls for a mathematization of physics does not imply that he is a good
mathematician. Reference to the author’s pet theories is only for the sake of exemplification, although
these theories were designed and elaborated exactly within the spirit and motivations of the present essay.
The reader should judge the present mathematization programme independently on his opinions on these

theories.
