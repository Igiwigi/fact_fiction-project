The
evolutionary reason for this sensitivity is unknown, but it can
be abolished by evolution occurring in the laboratory, through
a single nonsynonymous substitution in the hypothetical plas-
mid protein SkaA. It is not clear whether or how the wild-type
version of skaA benefits the plasmid, but the gene appears to be
essential for plasmid replication. Regardless, the fact that single
basepair mutations can have such dramatic effects on costly
plasmid-conferred phenotypes speaks to the importance of
specific gene functions, and gene interactions within the con-
text of a host cell [18,30]. With large MGEs carrying huge
numbers of genes of unknown function and activity, there is
great potential for conflicts to arise, and likewise for new
adaptive phenotypes to emerge. Compensatory evolution can occur to resolve MGE-associ-
ated fitness costs [8].
