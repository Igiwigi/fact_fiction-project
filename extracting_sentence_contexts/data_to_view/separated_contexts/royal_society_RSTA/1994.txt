His death was for me truly a bereavement.”!

3. Case study 2: Sir William Crookes FRS (1832-1919)

In his well-researched and highly readable biography of Crookes, W.H. Brock names Stokes
as ‘one of Crookes’s many ‘invisible’ helpers...’ [23, p. 11] although, as I will argue here,
there is ample evidence to show that Stokes was in fact the main and most significant
influence on Crookes’s scientific work. Crookes himself thought so when providing his record
of correspondence”? with Stokes to Larmor:

...if what I owe to Stokes is deducted from my work there will be precious little left I can
claim for my own!?3

The evidence below shows that this should not necessarily be regarded as a wholly
exaggerated claim. In the same letter to Larmor, Crookes explained his longstanding practice
of sending Stokes’s letters (the handwriting of which he had difficulty making out) to his own
printing office, for his head printer ‘could decipher almost anything’, and thus made his own
private printed copies. (This possibly reveals as much about Crookes’s wealth as it does the value
he placed on Stokes’s words.)

The intellectual debt owed by Crookes to Stokes is perhaps greater than that of any
scientist except Thomson/Kelvin.
