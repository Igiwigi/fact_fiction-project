Figure 4. Stress—time evolution of the system under a normal baseline scenario (shown with dotted red line) and a case where
a plastic event is stopped (shown with a solid black line). The stress drops associated with an event can be seen to vanish in the
arrested scenario. Furthermore, not only is the original event stopped but subsequent events disappear, thus implying causality.

stress drop at roughly the 100K time mark and two distinct dips. The first dip is a single plastic
event and is our target for arrest while the second dip is in fact two events occurring in rapid
succession. We note here that plastic events occur on a small but finite time duration of about
5000 time steps.

The solid line (black) line represents a simulation re-started from a checkpoint prior to the
target event and a successful arrest of said event (no stress drop). Furthermore, not only is
the targeted event stopped but also the two subsequent events disappear in this new timeline.
This provides strong evidence of a causal link between the stopped event and the ones that
disappeared afterwards.

Looking further in figure 4, we see a spike in the new timeline at about 250 K which is absent
from the original timeline. This spike is not a plastic event but rather a small coarsening event,
where a droplet overcomes the dis-joining pressure at the interface and merges with another.
