My Dxar Sis,

Tus investigation of the laws, by which the general mor-
tality of the human species appears to be governed, is of
equal importance to the statesman, the physician, the natural
philosopher, and the mathematician ; and as you have had
occasion to pay particular attention to the subject, I trust that
it will not be disagreeable to you to receive the results of an
inquiry, into which I have entered, for the purpose of appre-
ciating, if not of reconciling, the many discordant opinions
that have been advanced, respecting the comparative mortality
of mankind, at different times, and under different circum-
stances. Of late years, there is little doubt, that, whether from the
protective effects. of vaccination in infancy, or from the in-
crease of the comforts of the poorer, and of the temperance of
the more affluent classes of society, or in some measure also
from the simplification of the practice of physic and surgery,
there is a decided increase in the mean duration of life in
many parts of Europe : but it is also, extremely probable
that this improvement has been greatly exaggerated ; partly
on account of the limited description of the persons on whom


282 Dr. YounG's formula for expressing

the observations have been made, and partly from an erro-
neous opinion respecting the profits of certain establishments,
which have been attributed to the employment of too low
an estimate of mortality, while they have, in fact, been prin- .
cipally derived from the high rate of interest which the state
of public credit has afforded. A very laborious and well informed actuary has lately
asserted, before a Committee of the House of Commons, that
< the duration of existence now, compared with what it was a
hundred years ago, is as four to three, in round numbers.”
