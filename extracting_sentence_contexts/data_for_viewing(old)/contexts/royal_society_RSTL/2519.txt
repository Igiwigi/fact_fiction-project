but amongst the sessile-eyed Malacostraca we have more numerous observations.

Of these, as in the former, the researches of RaTake again stand foremost ; since,
in a series of memoirs, very recently published, upon the development of the ova and
embryos of various animals, we find the common Avsellus aquaticus to have been in-
vestigated by him, with the result that no material alteration takes place in the form
of the animal þ.

In the Annales des Sciences Naturelles for December 1833, is published a valuable
report, by M. Is1bors GReorFRoy ST. HiLAairg, upon a memoir of M. H. Muxs
Epwarps, entitled © Observations sur les changemens de forme que les Crus-
tac6s 6prouvent dans le jeune age.” Passing over the more generalized views de-
duced by M. ST. HiLairs from the facts noticed by M. Epwasps, I shall merely state
the latter. The genus Cymothoa, and some other Isopodous genera, afforded to
M. Epwarps an easy opportunity of examining the development of the eggs and the
structure of the young, in consequence of their being inclosed within the large sub-
thoracic pouch. Hence he was enabled to ascertain that some organs which are fully
developed in the adult animal, are either rudimental or absolutely wanting in the early
state : thus, in the latter the animal has only six thoracic segments, and six pairs of
legs, although when adult it has seven segments and seven pairs of legs. On the con-
trary, other organs, which are fully developed in the young, become rudimental in
the adult state : thus, in the former we find a large head, furnished with two large
oval black eyes, and the abdominal segments nearly as large as the thoracic ones;
whilst in the adult state the head is extremely small, the eyes are not externally
visible, and the abdominal segments are very short and linear. M. Epwarps has also
