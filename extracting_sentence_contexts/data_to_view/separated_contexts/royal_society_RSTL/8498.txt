This will be indefinitely small in
comparison with the prepotential of the disk, provided only #* is indefinitely small

compared with R***, that is # indefinitely small in comparison with R'**s. The proof
assumes that the mass ſg dS is finite; but considering the yery rough manner in which

the limit ſecs was obtained, it can scarcely be doubted that, if not universally, at least

for very general laws of distribution, even when ſe dS is infinite, the same thing is true ;
viz. that by taking e sufficiently small in regard to R, we can make the prepotential of
the remaining portion of the surface vanish in comparison with that of the disk, But
without entering into the question I assume that the prepotential of the remaining
portion does thus vanish ; the prepotential of the whole snrface in regard to the inde-
finitely near point P is thus equal to the prepotential of the disk; viz. its value is

which, observe, is infinite for a point P on the surface.

5. Considering the prepotential V of an arbitrary point (@. . . c, e) as a given function
of (@...c, e) the coordinates of this point, and taking (z. . . z, w) for the coordinates
of the point N, which is, in fact, an arbitrary point on the surface, then the value of V
at the point P indefinitely near to N will be =W, if W denote the same function of
(v...z, w) that Vis of (@...c, e). The result just obtained is therefore

As to this, remark that V is not an arbitrary function of (@...c, e): non constat
that there is any distribution of matter, and still less that there is any distribution of
matter on the surface, which will produce at the point (@... c, e), that is at eyery point
whatever, a prepotential the value of which shall be a function assumed at pleasnre of
the coordinates (@... c, e). But suppose that V, the given function of (a... c, e), is
8uch that there does exist a corresponding distribution of matter on the surface (viz.
that V satisfies the conditions, whatever they are, required in order that this may be the
case), then the foregoing formula determines the distribution, viz. it gives the expression
of e, that is, the density at any point of the surface.
