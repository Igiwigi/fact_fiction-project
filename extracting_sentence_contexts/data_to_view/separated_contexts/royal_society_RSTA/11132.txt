Thus, if the photographic effect be proportional to the
time and the intensity, the effect in the first instance on the photographic plates may

be represented thus :
, Z, VP 7 +") >
and in the second Zh ,

Hence the resultant effects, when superposed, are

B, (14+ A); Ey (1+)

The camera is then slightly raised, s’ is made’ equal to s, all the screens are
removed, and a photograph is taken on the same plate with an exposure merely
equal to that of each of the other two, the object being to obtain on the one plate
a comparison, not merely with reference to the absorption, but also with that of the
illumination. The effects on the photographic plate ought to be as follows :—

a| & +p) Zo +a 16

ABSORPTION PRODUCED BY FLUORESCENCE. 103

If there is no change of absorption (#) ought to be of the same intensity as ()). As a matter of fact, it was always found to be much denser in the negative. The
intensities of (b) and (d) were never exactly equal, but, on the contrary, (d) was
always darker than (b). Now, the width of the slit for (¢) was double that for (b),
but the exposure was half, which shows that if we double the intensity of the light
to which a photographie plate is exposed, the exposure must be less than half in
order that the same effect should be produced.
