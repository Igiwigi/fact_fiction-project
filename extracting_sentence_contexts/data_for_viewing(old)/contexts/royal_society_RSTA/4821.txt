the constraints. We can now represent the D-2 transverse variables in the cellular automaton as
classical degrees of freedom (both for the bosons and the fermions), while leave the remaining
variables to be exclusive properties of the quantized (super)string only. They do not affect the
dynamics, so our mapping remains valid.

This, however, leads to a problems concerning string interactions. In earlier publications, we
proposed to admit classical interactions when strings meet in a point. The classical interaction
could consist of an exchange of arms of the string at such meeting points. The problem with this
proposal is that the question whether strings coincide at one point will involve the dependent
degrees of freedom as well. If these are determined by quantum equations (the string- and
superstring constraints in operator form), then it is difficult to see how these interactions can
be seen as classical interactions in the automaton.Â° The difficulty is further exacerbated by the
fact that the procedure is not Lorentz invariant by construction; indeed, making the discretized
cellular automaton Lorentz invariant is rather difficult, and this difficulty shows up when we try
to include the string interactions.

This difficulty is also related to the question of background dependence. Our model, as yet,
is assumed to have a flat background. It is this flat background that then takes the form of a
rectangular lattice. Any interaction in the string would lead to gravitons interacting with it, and
these in turn would generate curvature in the background. One may suspect what all this means
physically: the lattice will feature local lattice defects of various forms; the strings may merge
with defect lines in some delicate manner, but all this has not been sorted out.

What we did find is one rather astonishing fact, which seems to have been overlooked by
string theoreticians: the lattice size parameter a is fixed in our theory. There is only one lattice size
