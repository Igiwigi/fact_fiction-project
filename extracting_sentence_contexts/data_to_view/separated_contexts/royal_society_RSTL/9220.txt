with the curves of VI. (2) for the same temperature (100*), that the effect of the
—M is greater with the pulled than with the unpulled wire for every degree of
magnetizing force ; while the effect of the +M is greater in the pulled wire for
magnetizing forces less than 250, and greater in the unpulled wire for magnetizing
forces exceeding 250. This was to be expected from the previously proved ($ 209,

magnetizing force is less than a critical value of 280 or 290 ; and greater susceptibility
in the unpulled than in the pulled wire when the magnetizing force exceeds the
critical value ; and from the fact that the difference in one direction of the 8uscep-
tibilities in the pulled and the unpulled wire when the magnetizing force is the
Glasgow vertical force, is about three times as much as the difference in the other
direction when the magnetizing force is 80 times the Glasgow vertical force. The
effect of the —M includes a reversal of the natural vertical force. That of the +M
is merely an addition to it.
