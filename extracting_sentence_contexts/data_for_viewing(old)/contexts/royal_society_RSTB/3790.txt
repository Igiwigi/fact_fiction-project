It must be remembered that in attempting to measure the width of chromosomes,
we are engaging on a problem which is rendered difficult on account of the small size
of the objects themselves. Mzrrx seems to claim accuracy to 0'01p, but we do not
believe that such a claim can be regarded as well founded. He made a number of
careful camera lucida drawings, at a magnification of 3048, and averaged the results
thus obtained. We do not know the + deviations from the mean finally adopted as
the accurate measurement. But it is evident that an error of 0°03 mm. in outlining
the chromosomes, or in measuring the widths of the drawing when finished, would
vitiate the calculated accuracy of the chromosome width by approximately 0°01 p.
We mention this in order to show that, in our opinion, very little reliance can be
placed on the value represented by the second place of decimals, in spite of the
fact that the measurements, as given by Mrgk, are always exactly the same. Thus,
the width of every chromosome of the higher Metazoan nuclei is stated to be
precisely 0°83 p.

We have made repeated measurements of the same individual chromosome under
various conditions and at different times and dates, in order to arrive at some know-
ledge of the limits of personal error in so far as we ourselves were concerned. The
results were such as to convince us that we could place very little reliance on esti-
mates carried beyond 0°1 ». We also experimented on possible differences which
might be attributable to different treatment, e.g. of fixing and staining, of the material.
Somewhat contrary to our anticipation, very little difference could be detected in
good preparations, and in any event it was so small as to be swamped by the much
larger personal margin of error. The same result was arrived at in testing the effect
