For an extension of 30 per cent. the
semi-angle of dispersion, ¢, assuming that the directions of the fibrils are distributed at
random within a cone of this semi-angle and that the thickness of a fibril is small
compared with its length, is given by

1-30 = ¢/sin ¢,

whence ¢=70°. This is greatly in excess of the dispersion of the spots of the
x-photograph and of the fibrils which were seen under the microscope in a chemically-
treated or diseased human hair ; in fact, these fibrils were almost parallel to the fibre
axis, and two isolated cortical cells, themselves built wp of fibrils, were some three hundred
times as long as they were broad. The results of X-ray analysis offer what appears to be the true explanation of the
characteristic elastic properties of hair described above. We know (1) that dry hair
will not stretch much beyond 30 per cent.
