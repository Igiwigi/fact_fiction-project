3 both halves of the important quadrigeminal region.

3 These are not, however, the only fibres observed from the capsule which pass to the

& quadrigeminal region; fibres can be traced in successive sections back to the quadri-
: geminal region, which are being given off from the degenerate fibres in the normal
© capsule in their course to form the crusta. One well-marked bundle passes from the
upper and incurved extremity of the pyramid just before the crusta is formed, to
the roof of the aqueduct, and lower down isolated fibres come off from the corre-
sponding extremity of the crusta (outer and upper extremity) and curve round to the
quadrigeminal region ; these latter fibres are figured by Muratorr.

Discussion of the Preceding Anatomical Facts and of the Literature relating to them.

Tn the preceding pages we have traced from the vicinity of the corpora quadri-
gemina, certain definite groups of degenerate nerve fibres, viz., the descending root
