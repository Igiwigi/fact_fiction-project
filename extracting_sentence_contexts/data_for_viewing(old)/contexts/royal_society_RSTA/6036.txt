with the shape factor o negligible in the expression (2.8) for 2.

In particular, the homogenized model can be used to study surface waves under the infinite-
metasurface critical-coupling condition, since then A, ~«1/?. For that case, figure 2a depicts
the real and imaginary parts of « as a function of frequency, assuming for later comparison
a wave in the x direction: 7 = é@, and « =x,. Consistently with the condition stated above for
the homogenization approximation to hold, the dispersion relation ‘folds’ and « is small for
all frequencies. As « — 0, one branch joins with the sound line « = e!/2Q, whereas on the other
branch 2 —> &. In the limit («, 2) > (0, 2), we have ¢, > oo and the limiting state propagates to
infinity, i.e. it is not a surface wave. In fact, this limiting state is nothing but the solution already
found in §3b describing perfect absorption of a normally incident plane wave.

Analysis of (4.2) in the critically coupled case Ay ~ €1/ reveals two distinguished regimes. The
first, defined by the scalings « — €¥/?2 ~5/® and @ — 2 ~e'/, corresponds to the dispersion
curve separating from the sound line as the resonance frequency is approached. In that regime,
lp ~1/e and ¢, ~1/e?/3, thus the waves propagate over large distances compared to the free-
space wavelength but also decay away from the substrate on a scale larger than the free-space
wavelength. In the second regime, defined by the scalings « ~ €!/? and 2 — 2 ~e'/?, viscosity
enters the dominant balance and turns the dispersion curve around. In that regime, ¢y, €) ~ 1 Jel/2,
thus the surface waves propagate and decay on length scales comparable to the free-space
wavelength.
