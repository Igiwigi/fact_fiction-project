in diameter, and
in its most usual condition, contains a dense skein of chromatin (fig. 56), During
certain phases of life the chromatin fuses up into a dense compact amorphous mass
devoid of any nuclear membrane. But, notwithstanding the fact that I have
examined some hundreds of specimens, stained by various reagents, I have never
observed the poly-energid nucleus, distributed into secondary nuclei scattered through
the cytoplasm, as described and figured by Harrmann (Plate 29, fig. 38) for
T. hertwigi. In one or two specimens I have observed the nuclear membrane wanting
over a portion of the circumference with a slight extrusion of the contained chromatin
—a condition which closely resembles HarrmMann’s fig. 32.
