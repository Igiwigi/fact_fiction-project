These may pass unnoticed, or be ignored, if competent observers suitably
equipped are not on the look-out for them. Warning symptoms are likely to be of short
duration, and if events are not to be left to chance, observation should be continuous
and observers well informed. The graphical representation of past records (fig. 2) brings out the fact that the
main centre of activity has tended to oscillate back and forth along that part of the
volcanic arc between St Kittâ€™s and St Vincent. We also know that minor disturbances
in one island have been the precursors of violent activity elsewhere; and that exceptional
activity in one island has been accompanied by sympathetic minor disturbances in
another, often some distance away. Records of the recent disturbances in Montserrat, when considered in relation to
certain previous volcanic episodes, have given information that may be of great service
in the future (cf.
