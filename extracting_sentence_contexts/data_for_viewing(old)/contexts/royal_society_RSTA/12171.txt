the medium. This rotation is the representative of electric force, or rather its effect
~ electric displacement, in the medium ; and, in so far as it is not along the interface,
its line integral from one body to the other will account for a difference of electric
potential between them. The electric force must be very intense, as in fact are all
_ molecular forces, in order to give rise to a finite difference of potential in so short a
range. If the bodies in contact are conductors, instead of dielectrics, similar con-

siderations apply, but now the internal equilibrium of each conductor requires that

the potential shall be uniform throughout it; therefore the surface stress must so
adjust itself that the difference of potentials between the conductors is the same at
Seach point of the interface.

The contact phenomena between a solid and a liquid are different from those
between two solids ; for the mobility of the liquid allows, after a sufficient lapse of
time, an adjustment of charged dissociated ions along its surface so as to ease off the
