On several occasions we observed that
retraction of the opposite side not only began before the protrusion of the same side,
but actually in a few instances it occurred alone, thus showing that it is probably the
more important movement of the two. We are now in a position to examine into
the condition of the tongue as observed in hemiplegia. Unfortunately the clinical
examination of the tongue has hitherto not been conducted so thoroughly as its
importance warrants ; and in fact, clinical observation is usually limited to noticing
whether the tongue is deviated to one side when protruded, without further
exploration of other movements. â€˜This is doubtless due to the fact that the move-
ments of the tongue generally have hitherto not been completely ascertained. Although this makes the task of explanation very difficult and for the present
impossible, we take leave to point out that the accepted views are plainly contrary to
fact and will have to be altered.
