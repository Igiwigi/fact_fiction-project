Since at our ordinary atmospherical heats, it pos-
sesses the greatest capacity for caloric, small variations in its
temperature give it a great modifying power over the
circumambient air. Although the doctrine of final causes
be no safe guide to the discovery of unknown truths, yet
when it concurs with experiment, we may deem it an agreeable

confirmation. This is finely illustrated by Count RumrorD's
speculations on the maximum density of water being placed


on some of the leading doctrines of caloric, &c. 38g

several degrees above its point of congelation ; a fact which
does not hold with regard to any other homogeneous
liquid. If the specific heat of water, then, diminish as its tempera-
ture advances from the freezing to the boiling point, an
interval of 10* near g2*, will contain more caloric than ten
degrees near 122*, and still more than the same intervals near
212*. On this principle we can readily account for the results
obtained by Mr.
