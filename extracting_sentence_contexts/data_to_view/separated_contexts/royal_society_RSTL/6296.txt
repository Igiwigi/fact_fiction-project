chamber occurred only in one of the tubes, and the other one was of nearly a
diameter from the testis to the anterior spherical chamber. In one, however, =
were symmetrical, as I have represented in Plate XVIL. fig. 31,56. to

The spermatozoa are apparently produced indiscriminately in all parts of the testis,
They are of an oval form, and are found in rounded masses (Plate XVII. fig, 39
I also found in some specimens cells containing filiform spermatozoa ; but later in the
autumn only the oval bodies were present. They are perhaps immature forms; but
against this view must be set the fact that the spermatheca of the female contained
these bodies only. Tt is, however, very unlikely that they should be altogether different
from the spermatozoa of the s0 nearly allied genus Obisium.

'The trachee open through orifices at the sides of the second and third abdominal
segments ; the spiracles lead into a short thick tube, from the end of which arise a
great number of long thin trachez, which pass, without giving off many branches, to
the different internal organs. Obisium.—T found, under a piece of wood, in September and October last, five 8peck-
mens of Obisium muscorum, only one of which was a female.
