N controls the number of features available for the linear regression used to solve for
Wout, Where the features come from the projected inputs Winx, further compounded with A every
update. Thus, we expect that below a critical N the span of the features will be insufficient to
fit the dynamics at all, with the span of the features saturating with large N (as all features
originally come from inputs x). This is in fact exactly what we see in figure 3a: performance
quickly improves up until about N = 50, and then improvement asymptotes as N continues to get
larger.

(iii) Reservoir unit nonlinearity o is not necessary for good generalization

Next, we examine the effect of changing the unit activation function o = tanh which is applied
to units at every update. The activation function (compounded throughout each time step)
is supposed to provide a critical nonlinearity to the reservoirâ€™s features. This nonlinearity is
proposed to be the key reason why ESNs are able to model a wide variety of systems well.
