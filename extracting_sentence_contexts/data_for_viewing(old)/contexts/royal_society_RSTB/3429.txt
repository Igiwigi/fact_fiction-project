regards the essential relationship between thyroid and parathyroid the evidence is not
so convincing as in mammals. Although a parathyroid is derived both from the third
and fourth clefts, yet the one derived from the latter does not become enclosed
by thyroid tissue as is the case in mammals. Apparently as a consequence of this
we do not meet with the transition forms between the two kinds of tissue which
T have described (vide infra), and depicted, in mammals,

Forsytu has largely employed birds to support his main thesis, and although the
results of my own investigation fully support his conclusions in mammals, I am
inclined to suspect that he has been somewhat hasty in placing thyroid tissue with
few and small vesicles in the category of parathyroid. It may seem inconsistent to
use the arguments put forward under another section (vide Mammals, infra) as applied
to mammals, and refuse to admit the same arguments in birds; but it seems, in fact,
that the intimate physiological and anatomical connection obtaining in mammals has
not yet been established in the class aves.*

The anatomy of the thyroid gland itself is too well known, both in the human
subject and in the majority of laboratory animals, to require any detailed description,

* ForsyTH says (‘Thyroid and Parathyroids in Mammals and Birds,’ p. 313) “'Thyroids normal.”
Has there yet been enough observation and research to establish what is normal? He does not mention
the thymus. Is he not aware that there is a nodule of thymus within the thyroid as well as a large body
