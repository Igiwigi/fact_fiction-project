What happens if we send
in higher photon numbers or squeezed states in different spectral modes into the QPG? In this
section, we answer this question by providing a simple analogy between the QPG and a spatial
network of beam splitters. In fact, even though we operate on the frequency degree of freedom,

sin(9). Any input state thus undergoes a unitary U>*** of which the first output corresponds to the pulse gate mode.
