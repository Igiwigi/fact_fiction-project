In addition, discrete simulation of fluid dynamics is far more than LB!
Besides advances in particle/grid computational fluid mechanics, such as
particle-mesh methods on multi-core graphics processing unit architectures,
exciting developments in allied particle methods, typically smoothed particle
aydrodynamics, particle-emesh methods for fluid flows, as well as constrained
molecular dynamics, are also reported. A new class of four-dimensional (space

ime) variational algorithms, tracking the unstable periodic orbits of high-
dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems are described, which may disclose new
avenues in computational studies of turbulence.

The pervasive nature of fluid flows—the fact that they are key to virtually
all human activities, life itself in the first place (air, water, blood)—is one of
the compelling aspects of the field, as well as one of its major strengths. Just
as complex fluids research is characterized by common underlying problems,
so computational methods, algorithms and implementations must transcend
disciplinary divides, hence the need of the new synthesis discussed earlier on
in this preface.

It is our major wish and hope that physicists, mathematicians, engineers,
computer scientists and, in general, all scientists working in allied fields, where
fluids play a major role, will be able to build on the work and experiences reported
here, in order to advance their own research.
