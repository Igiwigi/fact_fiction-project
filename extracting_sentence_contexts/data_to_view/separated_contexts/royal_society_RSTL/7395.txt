ence the conclusion is
that supersaturated solutions of the sodic sulphate are not really 80, since they hold a
salt of much greater s0lubility at common temperatures than the ordinary salt. It is
also stated that the solutions of the sodic carbonate and of the magnesic sulphate form
salts of a lower degree of hydration, and of greater solubility than the normal salts. Lowers general conclusion is that all cases of supersaturation are such in appearance
only, and not in fact. As to the function of nuclei and the inner sides of the flasks in
determining erystallization, he regards it as the effect of one of those mysterious contact
actions known as catalytic, of which science has not yet been able to give a satisfactory
explanation. Bodies that appear to be active in inducing crystallization are designated
catalytic or dynamic ; while bodies that are apparently inactive are termed non-catalytic
or adynamic.
