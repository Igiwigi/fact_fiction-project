Example. High frequency and small amplitude do not automatically guarantee stability:
stabilization must be strong enough to overcome the destabilization, in the sense of (1.3). As an
example, with! =1, g=1 anda=wsinaot (high acceleration, high frequency, small amplitude) the
condition (1.3) fails, and with it does stability, no matter how large w is: the centrifugal force of
the fictitious constraint in figure 1 is too weak to overcome gravity. Intuitively, the mean square
velocity v? is not high enough. Let us, therefore, increase the acceleration (and thus the velocity), keeping the same
frequency—take, for instance, a = @°!? sin wt.
