by There is one circumstance which is curious, and which-it
= will require further information upon this subject to explain;
i the yellow zone, found in the human eye and that of the mon-
EZ key, is not met with in any other animal which I have exa-
S mined. S Having $tated the facts, and also the opinions of other ana-
E tomists, that have come to my knowledge, as well as my own
a - observations, upon this orifice in the retina of the human eye,

discovered by Mr, SogEMMERING, and having added to these,
several new facts respecting it in other animals, I shall draw
some general conclusions from the whole, with a view to show
that the conjectures which have been made, respecting its use,
are probably erroneous, I shall afterwards point out several

reasons' for considering it as the orifice of a lymphatic vessel
intended to carry off the vitiated parts of the vitreous humour
and crystalline lens. f

In the human subject, as no examination can be made for
some considerable time after death, it is impossible to ascertain
what is'the real state of this orifice in the living eye, and what
changes take place in it after death; we only learn; that" the
tinge of yellow surrounding the orifice is very slight, when the
eye is examined recently, and that the next day it becomes
much deeper. These points appear to be satisfactorily cleared up, by the exa-
mination that was made of the monkey's eye, as it was begun be-
fore the parts had lost the appearance belonging to themas living
parts.
