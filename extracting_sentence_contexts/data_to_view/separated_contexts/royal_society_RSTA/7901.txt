For
instance, in the original work the lever had always been clamped in a definite position
at the close of each observation, but it was soon found that slightly greater consistency
was obtained by omitting the clamping—leaving the lever to swing freely—the jaws of
the arrestor being opened sufficiently to allow the lever to swing through an are of 30°,
the sextant arm being, of course, always set to a definite reading. In practice it would
not be possible to adopt such a procedure, for the balance has to be clamped before it
can be transported, but we hoped that observations made without the complication of
clamping might throw some light on the cause of the small variations in reading which
we have always treated as experimental errors. The fact that the observations were only
slightly more consistent when clamping was not resorted to seems to be connected with
the opinion we entertained, namely, that the main deviations were due to temperature
uncertainties, but that a small contribution was nevertheless made by the disturbance
caused by the clamping. Observations were made, of the action of a strong
magnet, to test the possibility of some magnetic effect, but not the slightest sign of
any such action could be found. The possibility of the lever becoming electrified
was also examined, by bringing up a considerable quantity of radium to the window
which lets in the light by which the lever is observed, but in no case was any effect
observed.
