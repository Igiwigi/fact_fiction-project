The whole of the previous investigation has been conducted on the hypothesis that
the tide-generating potential, estimated per unit volume of the earth's mass, is
wr (cos? PM—Z),* but in fact this expression is only the first term of an infinite
Series. I ghall now show what kind of quantities have been neglected by this treat-
ment. According to the ordinary theory, the next term of the tide-generating
potential is

m{r\3
