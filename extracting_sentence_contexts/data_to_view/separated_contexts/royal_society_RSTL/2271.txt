4, in a manner analogous to that in which mechanical forces are balanced against
each other by the intervention of the lever (1031.). 918. All the facts show us that that power commonly called chemical affinity, can
be communicated to a distance through the metals and certain forms of carbon ; that
the electric current is only another form of the forces of chemical affinity ; that its
power is in proportion to the chemical affinities producing it ; that when it is deficient
in force it may be helped by calling in chemical aid, the want in the former being
made up by an equiyalent of the latter ; that, in other words, the forces termed che-
mical affinity and electricity are one and the same. SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY IN THE VOLTAIC APPARATUS. 435
