Molecular analysis carried out by means of the coupled SEMâ€”Raman system proved the presence of calcium
carbonate (b). (Online version in colour.)

The analytical procedure applied to the study of sample M03 was repeated on other samples
at our disposal. Both elemental and molecular data obtained from all samples highlighted
a similar composition to sample M03. In fact, all cross-sections show an inner part almost
entirely composed of magnetite and covered by external iron hydroxide layers. Furthermore, the
correspondence between Cl-affected areas and the development of reactive iron oxyhydroxides
phases (akaganeite and lepidocrocite) was also repeated.

(c) Treatment assessment

As mentioned above, the third part of this analytical study was focused on the study of the effects
caused by NaOH desalination baths (pH ~ 13.3) on fire gilded iron artefacts. Considering the
gilded area preserved on it, sample M01 was selected for the application of the NaOH treatment.
