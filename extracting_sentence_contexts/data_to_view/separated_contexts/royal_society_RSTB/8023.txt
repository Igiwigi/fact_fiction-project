Distribution and thickness. Unaltered Newmarracarra Limestone has a very limited dis-
tribution in the Geraldton district, by far the most extensive outcrops being found in the
area mapped in detail (figure 1). Elsewhere, outcrops are very sporadic, owing to the fact
that over a large part of the area the limestone is completely altered by lateritization. Owing to this irregular alteration, the thickness of limestone cropping out is very variable,
the thickest exposures being near Round Hill (the type section), where up to 33 ft. of
unaltered limestone is exposed. Elsewhere the formation is invariably altered to some

VoL. 237.
