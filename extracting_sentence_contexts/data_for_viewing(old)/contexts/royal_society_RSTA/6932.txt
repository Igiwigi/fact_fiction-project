in which Y” is a constant, then for a cylindrical mass of liquid of radius a, with a force-free
curved surface, in a state of torsional flow, the normal stress Z’ over the plane ends is given,
from equations (2-7) and (2-8), by

Z' =P" (2r—a). (18-2)
We see that Z’ = 0 when r = 4a, a conclusion which is in disagreement with the experi-
mental results for the solutions, for which the form of ‘" given by (18-1) has been found to
apply. For example, for a 6 % solution of B120 polyisobutylene in tetralin, at 25-0° G, it is
seen from figures 8 and 10 that Z’ = Oat approximately r = 0-854), ifais taken as the external
radius a, of the inner cup, and whenr = 0-714,, if it is taken as the internal radius a, of the
éuter cup. This disagreement is quite comprehensible in view of the fact that under the
perimental conditions the cylindrical mass of liquid does not have a force-free curved
sarface ( see §9).
elt was seen in §9 that this would result in a displacement of the h against r curves parallel
to the / axis. An estimate may be made of the expected amount of this displacement from the
Hllowing considerations.
5 We consider the liquid in the apparatus to consist of a cylindrical mass of length / and
1 dius a, in torsional flow and an annular mass above it in the region between the cylindrical

Mls of the two cups.

4 We idealize the state of flow in the annular region between the cylindrical walls of the
®o cups as a uniform steady state of laminar flow in which each point of the liquid moves
