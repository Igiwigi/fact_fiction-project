If absolute values are
required, the method has many drawbacks. ‘he artificial resistances are subject to
considerable variation, and are themselves calibrated one from another in such a
manner as to give every opportunity for the accumulation of errors. There is reason
to suppose that the resistance to feeble currents, such as would be produced by a few
cells, will depend on the previous history, and will not be by any means the same
when the current is reversed. In Kotrer’s experiments the current was, in general,
not reversed; in fact, the peculiar behaviour of the liquids investigated did not
permit of the method of reversal being employed in all cases. Since the resistance
comparison depends on the comparison of two potential differences, it is necessary to
eliminate the electrode effects without taking advantage of the method of reversals. Ko.uer allowed for the electrode effects by observing them when no current was
flowing, which was, perhaps, as much as the circumstances permitted, but could
hardly be considered sufficient when absolute measurements are in question.
