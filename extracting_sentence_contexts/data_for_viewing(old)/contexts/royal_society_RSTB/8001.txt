significance, while the differences between the two with regard to the structures near the
Ovary are probably the result of specialization on the part of the elephant, perhaps related

to its great size. Their condition in Hyrax is more like that of the generality of mammals and
is doubtless the less specialized of the two.

Anatomical differences between Elephas maximus and Loxodonta africana are relatively few,
although they differ in average size, in the shape of the head and in the more ‘rangy’
appearance of the African elephant, with its relatively longer legs and evident adaptation
for more rapid movement in open country. The two animals in fact differ more obviously
than a list of diagnostic characters of each would suggest. The present material includes two
specimens of the African ‘forest elephant’ (nos. 21 and 22), which has sometimes been
described as a distinct species of Loxodonta. The characters and status of ‘L. cyclotis’ have
been discussed by Allen (1936) and by Morrison-Scott (1947). It was first distinguished
as a species by Matschie (1900) and is characterized by being of smaller size than L. africana,
by its relatively long thin tusks, the ivory of which is more brittle, and by the distinctive
lobed ear. But though the forest elephant is recognizable as a race or subspecies of constant
type, it is very doubtful whether it is sufficiently different from L. africana to warrant its
classification as a distinct species. That the two races (‘bush’ and ‘forest’ elephants)
mingle and interbreed to some extent is apparent from Offermann’s account (1939, and
see Morrison-Scott 1947).
