This has been
worked out by Mr O’Dowd, using the form of f given in (17-8) with ¢=2.

(c) x negligible, ty of order —2, or larger; neutral power phugoids; zooming. As in §9, we
can take w’ to be of the first order, and write the third equation (14-5) in the same form
as (9-1). The equations (14-5) give in fact

and the nature of the approximation is the same as in §9. Once again q’ = 0 is a first
approximation. GENERAL MOTION OF THE AEROPLANE 335

(i) If d@/dt is zero initially, then it is zero permanently, so that the machine does
not turn, and Gx points in the constant direction 0.
