As shown in the upper part of figure 2, there is an expected path of human augmentation, in
sync with the progressive availability of the evolving technology slate. In particular, it is expected

— Internet-augmented humans: the Internet is becoming an integral part of each of us.
The penetration of smart devices and Internet connectivity may not be at 100% but the
majority of human beings on the planet are connected in some way to the Internet and
most importantly have made the Internet an integral part of their tool of trade. The
smartphone has become a sort of prosthetic for our memory, for our capacity to reach

smartphone is augmenting our capabilities. In a short period of time, it will feel perfectly

have software that can imitate the inflection and tone of our voice. Bring the two together
and you'll get a ‘You’ speaking in a hundred unique languages. Shared information and
co-presence in cyberspace like social media have changed our perception of vicinity and
the meaning of Dunbar’s number.

— Ambient-augmented humans: the ambient is being transformed by Information of
Things, by smart materials, by Al-based voice interactions and in the near future by
augmented reality. Additionally, new virtual ambients are becoming available, extending
our capabilities, including our learning capabilities. Ambient-mediated actions, like the
