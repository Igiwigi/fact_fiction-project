wenty-three hours in eggs distant from the air-bubbles, while in experiment j, with only
en eggs in the cell, and complete exclusion of air, they continued for twenty-nine
10urs,

& hours, leaving the yelk-ball globular and relaxed, while in experiment 9, with only
ten eggs in the cell, they persisted for more than thirty-five hours,

The pseudo-cleavage, or contractions of the concentrated formative yelk in unimpreg-
Ated eggs, and probably also the concentration of the formative yelk, seem to demand
eo presence of oxygen as well as a due supply of water: for in experiment 6, after
tFelve hours it was less advanced than in the ova of control experiment 3. Tt also was
wn to cease long before the yelk-contractions, and may be supposed to consume more
Fygen, although there are other explanations which may be offered of this fact, espe-
Ally the tendeney of the matter of the discus proligerus to undergo chemical change
a disintegration. J

Z Cleavage may be said to demand more oxygen than do the yelk-contractions, as in ex-
Eriments & to // it always ceased long before, and was more promptly checked by in-
Fasing the number of eggs in the cell. It is also more quickly arrested than psendo-
Heavage, and would scem therefore to need oxygen more.

Slndirectly, bursting of the inner sac and consequent cessation of the yelk-contractions
ends upon access of oxygen, which acts by favouring decomposition when the water
Enot changed.
