(8) Small chordotonal organ

Pflugstaedt (1912) describes this organ as stretching across the haltere in a vertical direc-
tion from a point on the dorsal surface at the distal margin of the basal plate to a point
on the ventral surface behind the proximal end of the scapal plate. In different Diptera
it may slope to a varying extent proximally and distally, but it is always vertical. The shape
of the basal region of the haltere is so complicated that it is not possible to deduce with any

degree of reliability what applied forces will produce a change in length between the two
points of attachment of the organ, but the fact that it is consistently oriented in the vertical
plane suggests that it responds to distortions produced by the vertical oscillation of the
haltere.

SUMMARY OF DEDUCTIONS FROM THE STRUCTURE OF THE SENSILLA

Of the eight groups of sensilla described by Pflugstaedt (1912) and confirmed in the
present work, the foregoing discussion suggests a functional grouping as follows:

A. Sensitive to the strains produced by the vertical oscillation of the haltere:
Dorsal scapal plate, Ventral Hicks papillae,
Ventral scapal plate, Small chordotonal organ.
Dorsal Hicks papillae,
