The feedlot cattle are the second largest contributor to emissions in the BU overestimated
subregions (subdomains 12_02 and 15_02), and the UNSW inventory assumes that they operate
at full capacity. Reducing the feedlot cattle population to a percentage of the licenced capacity
would improve the match between BU and TD emission estimates in these subregions. In fact,
removing feedlot emissions from the subregions would in part reduce the need to decrease CSG
emissions in order to match BU and TD estimates. There are two subdomains where piggeries
contribute greater than 20% of the CH4 emissions (15_04 and 15_05); these sources require closer
examination. There are also cases where the CSG water ponds (10_03, 16_04, and 19_01) contribute
greater than 20% of the subregion emissions.
