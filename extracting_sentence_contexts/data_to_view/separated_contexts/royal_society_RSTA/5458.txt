The sphere will now probably be quite gas-tight, but it must be further
tested when filled with gas by immersing it in water, and observing for some time if
any bubbles grow upon its surface. The catchwater of platinum foil with which each sphere is provided, is arranged to
be easily removed. It is, in fact, hooked on to two little wire loops soldered to the
sides of the sphere. The idle sphere, or counterpoise, is not, of course, tested. It is only necessary to
make sure that it is perfectly air-tight.
