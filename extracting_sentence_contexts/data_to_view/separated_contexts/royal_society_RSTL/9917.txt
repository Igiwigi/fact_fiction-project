In the smaller tubes generally, and with the larger tube in the case of the ice-cold
water at 40*, the first evidence of instability was an occasional flasch beginning ab the
usual place and passing out as a disturbed patch two or three inches long. As the
velocity was further increased these flashes became more frequent until the disturbance
became general,

I did not see a way to any very crucial test as to whether the steady motion became
unstable for a large disturbance before it did 80 for a small one ; but the general
impression left on my mind was that it did in 80me way—as though disturbances in

the tank, or arising from irregularities in the tube, were necessary to the existence of
a state of instability. But whatever these peculiarities may mean as to the way in which eddies present
themselves, the broad fact of there being a critical value for the velocity at which the
steady motion becomes unstable, which critical value is proportional to
