Keywords: quantum technologies. These advances have rendered

the aforesaid technologies mature enough to support
the realization of experiments that test the foundations
of quantum theory at unprecedented scales and in
the unexplored space environment. Such experiments,

Paolo Villoresi theory and may provide new insights to investigate
phenomena where gravity affects quantum objects.
Here, we review recent results in satellite quantum
communications and discuss possible phenomena
that could be observable with current technologies.
Furthermore, stressing the fact that space represents
an incredible resource to realize new experiments
aimed at highlighting some physical effects, we
challenge the community to propose new experiments
that unveil the interplay between quantum mechanics
and gravity that could be realizable in the near future.

This article is part of a discussion meeting issue
‘Foundations of quantum mechanics and their impact
on contemporary society’.
