Dawsox, deep longitudinal furrows exist at its outer
surface,â€”but these furrows are, as I have already shown, perfectly distinct from thoge
of the true Sigillarie. They are bub the fisxures occasioned by the increase in the
diameter of the stem, due to the growth of its more internal tissnes. One fact is
rendered further obvious from these specimens, viz., that this bas tissue increases in
thickness along with the increase in the diameter of the other tissues forming the
stem, but my specimens throw no additional light upon the physiological question
discussed in my previous memoir (Part IX., p. 355), viz. : Whether the additions to the
thickness of this bast layer are due to a plane of genetic activity on its external or its
internal surface. Tangential sections of this bast layer exhibit no peculiarities in the
arrangement of its prosenchymatous cells. I have already stated that I have obtained one cast or impression of what appears
to have been the outer 8urface of the bark of one of these large stems.
