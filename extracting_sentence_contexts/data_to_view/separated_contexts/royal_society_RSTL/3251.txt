had when bounding the convex surface of the ancient waters. Lastly. The in-
ferences from this head, 8upported by other cases, namely, that a large area must
have been upraised, and that this was effected by a slight change in the convex
form of the fluid matter on which the crust rests ; and, therefore, that the fluidity is
sufficiently perfect to allow of the atoms moving in obedience to the law of gravity,
and consequently of the effects of that law modified by the centrifugal impulse, Hence,
that even the disturbing forces do not tend to give to the earth a figure widely dif-
ferent from that of a spheroid in equilibrium.
