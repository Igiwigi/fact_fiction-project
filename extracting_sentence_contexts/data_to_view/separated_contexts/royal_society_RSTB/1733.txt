‚Äùt Of these
characters the spiral arrangement of the sporophylls is, perhaps, the least constant,
for M. Zermxer himself points out in the same work that in his Lepidostrobus Olryi
the phyllotaxis is verticillate. I therefore attach no importance to the fact that in
Spencerites the arrangement appears to have been variable in this respect. In several points, however, the strobili described above diverge from the character
of Lepidostrobus. The form of the limb or lamina is totally unlike, and its preserva-
tion, especially in S. majusculus, is sometimes sufficiently perfect for us to be sure
that the difference is a real one.
