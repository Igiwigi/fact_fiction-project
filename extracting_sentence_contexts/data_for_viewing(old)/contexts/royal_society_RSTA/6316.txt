into basin-wide vertical and horizontal cells (figure 8) shows that 92% (1.10 PW) of the total
time-mean MHT at 26.5° is carried by the vertical overturning circulation and 8% (0.10 PW) is
carried by the residual horizontal circulation. Furthermore, 95% of the total MHT variance is
accounted for by the variance of the overturning component. The horizontal cell component has
weak interannual variability and is mainly dominated by a seasonal cycle, which involves the
seasonal cycles of the Florida Current and upper ocean interior flows but also reflects a difference
in the amplitude and phase of the seasonal cycle of temperatures in the Florida Current and upper
ocean interior (figure 5).

The above simple breakdown into vertical and horizontal cells has been criticized for not
providing a meaningful measure of the actual ‘gyre’ component of heat transport, because the
waters flowing northward in the Gulf Stream that recirculate in the gyre do not, in general,
return on constant depth surfaces (e.g. [72]). In fact, some portion of the Gulf stream waters that
recirculate in the gyre (as well as all of the northward Ekman transport at 26.5°) is subducted
into the thermocline by Ekman pumping and returns southward at greater depths (and densities)
than the original Gulf Stream waters. Talley [72] made two estimates of the gyre component of
heat transport by assuming that the Florida Current waters that recirculate southward in the
gyre were either (a) uniformly distributed through the entire density range of the Florida Current
above the maximum density of the interior southward flow, or (b) completely contained within
the lightest (warmest) layers of the Florida Current. At 24° N, Talley [72] estimated these values to
be (a) 0.09 PW and (b) 0.40 PW, obviously indicating a large range of possible estimates depending
on the assumptions made.

We can perform a calculation similar to that of Talley’s by using the average results of all the
Florida Current sections over the RAPID period to estimate the mean transport of the Florida
