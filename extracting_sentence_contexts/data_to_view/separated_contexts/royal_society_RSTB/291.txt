The auditory chain of Pelobates and Otilophus (fig. 9B) is very simple ; it
is let into the fenestra ovalis by a stapedial disk; this passes into a straight or a
curved slender rod (mediostapedial), the outer end of which is bent downwards
(extrastapedial), and is attached to the middle of the tympanum. There is no
attachment of the fenestri-tympanal elements with either mandible, quadrate, or
hyoid. Axsrecut’s “figure schématique,” in which he represents the Amphibian
ossicular chain as connected with the mandible, is not supported by facts (cf. his
