The coefficients t() define the so-called Ramanujan tau function. Ramanujan conjectured that
|t(p) < 2pt/2) for every prime p. The importance of A comes from the fact that if we write
q=e" then A(z) is a cusp form of weight 12 on the upper half plane H={z=x+iy|x,ye
R, y > 0} with respect to the modular group ” = SL2(Z) acting on Hi by Mobius transformation
(25)(z) = (az + b)/(cz +d). Now if Ij(N) = {(04) €I|c=0 mod N} we denote S;(N) (or more
generally S,(N,w) for a Dirichlet character w of Z/NZ) the space of cusp forms on H w.r.t. I(N)
(and w).
