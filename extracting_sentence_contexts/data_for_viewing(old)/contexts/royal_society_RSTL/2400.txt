power, and the curyes were computed accordingly, but the formula: will of course

I have only to add to the foregoing relation of facts, that I do hope they will prove
satisfactory to those friends who have felt s0 much interested upon the subject as to
induce me to write this Paper, it not being my wish to take credit to myself for any-
thing like an invention, but merely for the application of the lens to the micrometer,
as I am fully convinced that a concave lens, either simple or achromatic, was never
50 applied before,
