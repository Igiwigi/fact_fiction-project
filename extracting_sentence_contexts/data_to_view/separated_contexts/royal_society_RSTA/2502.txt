This exact balance actually can be broken by symmetry,
leading to F > C. The simple example of connected rods in two dimensions illustrates this point
well, described in the caption to figure 2. The role of symmetry in enabling the existence of a non-zero number of RUMs is seen by
the fact that when a network structure can exist in several phases of different symmetry it has
always been found that there are more RUMs in the higher-symmetry phases [11]. The reason for
this is illustrated in the case of the squares. If the RUM generates a phase transition to a 2 x 2
structure through rotations of the squares, where we denote the rotation angle by 6, the crystal
will necessarily undergo a strain « x —6?.
