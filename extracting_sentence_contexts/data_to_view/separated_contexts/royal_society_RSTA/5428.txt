As formally represented by the tuple, the Industry 4.0-compliant
digitalization approach means a radical shifting from this traditional component-oriented to a
capability-oriented infrastructure. It is a kind of servitization process, which shifts the focus from
the all-in-one component model towards capabilities, e.g. functionalities offered via an IoS-based
function-/business-oriented infrastructure, which also allows the composition/orchestration of
distributed services that are dynamically put together. As a matter of fact, any tuple <asset, life cycle-phase-of-the-asset, layer 6> is able to publish,
offer data, information and functions as ‘services’, as well as subscribe, consume and compose
‘services’ offered by other tuples. Moreover, the individual digitalization layers can be opened up

to other stakeholders, which can provide their highly customizable capabilities and sophisticated are

With the use of the AAS [20] in the RAMI4.0-compliant digitalization, this capability-driven [Ss
way is drastically reshaping how industrial systems are designed, developed and operated. [Ss
Essentially, the form of specifying and implementing from layers 3 (communication) to 6 DO
(business) of the vertical dimension, i.e. third element of the tuple, for any asset positioned within
the RAMI 4.0 model, is creating a uniquely addressable digital (cyber) image, information that
formally represents the characteristics, functions and behaviours for each type and instance of
that asset (figure 3).
