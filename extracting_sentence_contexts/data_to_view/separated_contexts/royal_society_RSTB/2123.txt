Moreover such a hypothesis is in accordance with many facts which seem
inexplicable on the excalation theory. Putting on one side the extraordinary amount
of inter- and excalation at different spots in the vertebral column which, as
mentioned above, would be necessary to account for the facts, there still remain
those instances in which a nerve may partly pass through the girdle and partly over
it, and also those in which, with a normal vertebral column, the serial number of the
girdle-piercing nerve varies on the two sides of the same animal. On the migration
theory such facts receive a simple explanation, whilst on the excalation theory it is
difficult to see how they can be accounted for. :

Summary. The facts recorded in this paper may be conveniently summarised as follows :—

(1) The anterior collector passes through a stage in which more branches are
present than in subsequent development.
