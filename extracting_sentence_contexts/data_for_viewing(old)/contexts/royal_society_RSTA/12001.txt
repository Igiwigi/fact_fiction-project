30. It is important to emphasize the dynamical distinction between electric force
and electric displacement in a dielectric. The electric force is that vector which
occurs in the rotational stress in the wether, and which, divided by the proper elastic
cient ¢?/87, gives the rotational strain or electric displacement in it. This is not
civeuital when there are moving electrons present, but by adding a fictitious electric
placement representing the drift of the electrons, a circuital total displacement is
obtained, ‘This fictitious displacement or true current represents, however, the rotation
a hydrodynamical flow of the ether which the motion of the electrons sets up, which
belongs to the kinetic energy and in ordinary electrodynamical applications constitutes

actically the whole of it. At an interface separating media of different dielectric

equal to the tangential component of the electric force but at right angles to its
a. it follows that the tangential components of the electric force must be
