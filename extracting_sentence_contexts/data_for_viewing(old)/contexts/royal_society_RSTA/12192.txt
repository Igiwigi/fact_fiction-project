steady magnetic field.


THE ELECTRIC AND LUMINIFEROUS MEDIUM. 807

One way of bringing about this desired interaction of magnetic with clastic energy,
the same time safeguarding the permanence-of the atomic current, would be to
make it a current of convection, 7.c. to suppose the core of the vortex-ring to be made
up of discrete electric nuclei or centres of radial twist in the medium. The circulation
of these nuclei along the circuit of the core would constitute a vortex which can move
bout in the medium, without suffering any pressural reaction on the circulating nuclei
uch as might tend to break it up; the hydrodynamic stability of the vortex, in fact,
uffices to hold it together. But its strength is now subject to variation owing to
astie action, so that the motion is no longer purely cyclic. A magnetic atom,
onstructed after this type, would behave like an ordinary electric current in a non-
dissipative circuit. It would for instance be subject to alteration of strength by
nduction when under the influence of other changing currents, and to recovery when
that influence is removed ; in other words the Weberian explanation of diamagnetism
would now hold good.

_ The monad elements (§ 70) out of which a magnetic molecule of this kind is built
up are electric centres or nuclei of radial rotational strain. From what is known of
molecular magnitudes, in connexion with electrochemical data, it would appear that
to produce an intensity of magnetization of 1700 ¢.g.s., which is about the limit attain-
