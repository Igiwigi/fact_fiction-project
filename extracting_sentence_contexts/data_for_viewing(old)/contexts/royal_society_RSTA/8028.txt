The process of tension-decay and the “ freeing” of the load/extension curve does
not markedly alter the progress of the transformation as revealed by the X-ray photo-
graphs. We must conclude that the keratin phases are both in series and in parallel,
in series because their respective transformations follow one another in a definite order
and at roughly fixed intervals of extension, and in parallel because they so obviously
restrict one another and are so closely inter-related that it is impossible to transform
one without involving, to some extent, another. To a first approximation we may
say that decay of tension produces no clear-cut changes in the X-ray photograph for
a given extension. The intramolecular changes taking place can be no more than
modification of certain side-chain linkages between neighbouring main-chains.* Why
such changes are not immediately discernible in the X-ray photographs will be gone
into more fully below. For the moment, it will suffice to draw attention once more
to the fact that they do become quite obvious when steam acts on hair stretched to
more than 50%, and that the “ spreading” of the spots so produced is perhaps just
visible after the prolonged action of water even at ordinary temperatures.

Hair that has been held stretched in cold water so as to suffer loss of tension does
not lose its ultimate power of elastic recovery ; it manifests, with increasing loss of
tension, only an increasing loss of speed in regaining its initial length when the external
stretching force is removed. For instance, in one series of experiments, a Cotswold
wool fibre that at first snapped back almost instantaneously when released in water
immediately after an extension, took 1600 minutes to recover in water at room tem-
perature from an extension of 50:7, to one of 5-7%, after it had been held stretched
in water at the higher extension for 214 days. This behaviour, in view of what has been
said above about the loosening action of water on the strained side-chains, seems
