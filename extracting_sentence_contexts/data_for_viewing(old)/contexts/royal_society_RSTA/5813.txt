earlier in this section. Thus we see that Vn € N

where I view S, as embedded in R* in the usual way. A pair of scalar fields y and & can be
defined on each of the above multiverses in a manner analogous to the way it was done for the
multiverses presented in equation (3.14). The scalar field ¢ in turn gives rise to a Lorentzian metric
tensor on the multiverse in accordance with equation (1.8), and this metric tensor is everywhere
continuous and of class C® except at the points of discontinuity in gy. The important thing
about the construction is that Vn € N, when ¢ <0, g=t and € =0. I shall call this portion of the
multiverses presented in equation (3.59) the ‘tail’ of that four-dimensional multiverse. Note that
this tail is actually a four-dimensional open submanifold of each multiverse. The fact that all of
the multiverses have the same tail, is the key to the construction of the megamultiverse. But before
I do that I would like to say a few words about time travel.

Say we are given two points (t1, pi) and (t2, p2) in T(Dp), where tz > t) > 0. We embed T(Dy) in
T(Dy) x R as the ‘0 slice’, and build a ‘shunt’ in T(D,) x R from the point ((t, p1), 1) to ((t2, p2),
1). T(Dy) with this shunt is the underlying manifold of a new time manifold T(D,)’, with its C°
structure defined in the obvious way. If we cross T(Dn)’ with Mx (where Mg could be either Sx, R
or Hy, depending upon the choice of k, which is fixed) we obtain a four-dimensional manifold with


a global time function in which it is possible to travel from the branch of T(Dn) x Mx containing
(t, p1) to the branch containing (t2, p2). The problem, which I do not know how to solve, is to
