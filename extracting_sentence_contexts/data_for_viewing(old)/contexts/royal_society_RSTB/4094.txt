fertilisation appears immediately after the entrance of the head of the sperm cell.
Its formation begins at the place of entrance of the sperm cell, the surface of the egg
often showing slight changes of shape here, as if amceboid movement were going on.
After complete separation, the membrane stands off from the egg at a distance which
varies from a narrow slit to a half or more of the diameter of the egg itself.

Rapid osmosis of fluid through the egg membrane must be taking place at this time. Rresâ€™s (77,
p. 184) observations seem to indicate that this occurs by the throwing out from the egg at the place of
entrance of the sperm of a clear mass which has the property of rapidly absorbing water so that it swells
up greatly and extends quickly round the whole egg. Probably such a substance is thrown from the egg,
beginning at the place of entrance of the sperm, but many circumstances indicate that the extrusion of
this substance cannot be localised at the point in question, but takes place all round the surface of the
egg. Among these circumstances are the facts (1) that the sperm may enter at any point on the surface

of the egg, (2) that the formation of the membrane of fertilisation may be artificially induced by
numerous agents which bear on the egg equally all round, (3) that a membrane of fertilisation is formed
and stands out widely from the egg even in such large ova (1 mm. in diameter) as those of Solaster endeca
(29, p. 11). It is exceedingly improbable that the very large space thus formed could be filled by the
swelling up of a tiny mass extruded from a minute portion of the surface of the egg.

The sperm cell can enter the egg and induce the formation of a membrane of
