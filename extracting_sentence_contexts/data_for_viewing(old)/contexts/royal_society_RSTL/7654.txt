the gaseous state down to the volume of the liquid, without giving evidence at any part
of the process of liquefaction having occurred? Does it continue in the gaseous tate,
or does it liquefy, or have we to deal with a new condition of matter? If the experi-
ment were made at 100*, or at a higher temperature, when all indications of a fall had
disappeared, the probable answer which would be given to this question is that the gas
preserves its gaseous condition during the compression ; and few would hesitate to
declare this statement, to be true, if the pressure, as in NATTERER's experiments, were
applied to such gases as hydrogen or nitrogen. On the other hand, when the experi-
ment is made with carbonic acid at temperatures a little above 31*, the great fall which
occurs at one period of the process would lead to the conjecture that liquefaction had
actually taken place, although optical tests carefully applied failed at any time to dis-
cover the presence of a liquid in contact with a gas. But against this view it may be
urged with great force, that the fact of additional pressure being always required for a
further diminution of yolume, is opposed to the known laws which hold in the change
of bodies from the gaseous to the liquid state. Besides, the higher the temperature at
which the gas is compressed, the less the fall becomes, and at last it disappears.

'The answer to the foregoing question, according to what appears to me to be the true
interpretation of the experiments already described, is to be found in the close and inti-
mate relations which subsist between the gaseous and liquid states of matter. The
ordinary gaseous and ordinary liquid states are, in short, only widely separated forms of
the same condition of matter, and may be made to pass into one another by a series of
gradations 80 gentle that the passage shall nowhere present any interruption or breach
of continuity. From carbonic acid as a perfect gas to carbonic acid as a perfect liquid,
the transition we have seen may be accomplished by a continuous process, and the gas
