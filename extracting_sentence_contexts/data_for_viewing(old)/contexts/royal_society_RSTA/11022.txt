where ¢1, #2 denote arbitrary and y, Y2 definite functions. But suppose these equations solved for

and the arbitrary functions eliminated by differentiation. The differential equations thus formed are of
the first degree in p,, pe, 41, qa, and are not by any means of the general form assumed. ‘The differential
equations in the examples given by Professor KONIGSRERGER are, in fact, linear (see pp. 319, 328). The
method appears to be founded on an interpretation of the last clause of § 2 (p. 290), which is not justified.


PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. 171

In the case of two equations of CLarraut’s form

Y = Py + pyr, + PP, Pas Us Q)s
2 = NX + Gey + WP, Pos Ns Q)s
which will be more fully considered later, the number of differential relations among
the parameters is two, so that one parameter may be taken as an arbitrary function
of a second, and the other two found in terms of the second by solving two ordinary
