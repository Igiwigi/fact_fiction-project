The hourly observations made at the Colonial observatories were received at Wool-
wich in the form of monthly tables, in which the days of the month were arranged in
Successive horizontal lines, and the hourly observations in twenty-four vertical columns;
an additional column at the side showed the mean of each day, and an additional line
at the bottom of the Table the mean of each hour in the month. Even a very super-
ficial examination of these Tables at any one station sufficed to show that certain hours
were more affected by disturbance than others. These hours were not the same at
different stations; and no distinct relation could be traced at any station between the
hours of principal disturbance and those of the well-recognized horary fluctuation due
to the regular solar-diurnal variation. It was obvious therefore that the horizontal line
at the bottom of each monthly table, which showed the mean values at the several hours
(or what might be termed the diurnal inequality), did in fact represent two variations,
viz. 1st, the regular s0lar-diurnal variation, and 2nd, a diurnal yariation due to the dis-
turbances ; the two having every appearance of proceeding either from distinct causes or
from distinct actions of the same original cause. The means of separating them per-
Feetly from each other did not readily present themselves, but to do 80 approximately,
and with an approximation quite sufficient for many practical purposes, was merely a
work of labour, The yery feature which marked certain of the observations as disturbed,
viz. the magnitude of their discordance with the other records standing in the same
column with themselvyes, or (as more readily seen) the magnitude of their differences from
the mean yalue at the same month and hour at the foot of the page, appeared to supply
a ready means (in the absence of any more exact criterion) of distinguishing the observa-
tions which were most affected by disturbance. Tt was s0on found that by assuming for
each element and for each station a certain amount of difference from the monthly mean
