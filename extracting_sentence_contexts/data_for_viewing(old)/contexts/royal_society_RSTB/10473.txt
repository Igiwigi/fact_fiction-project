matrix model (see main text for details of calculation of eigenvalues in the
periodic environment). The cost of sex displayed in (b) was defined as the
N-fold increase in population size of a hypothetical obligate asexual relative
to a facultative sexual (within the average generation time of B. calyciflorus
as determined by life table data used in this study, i.e. 3.8 days). Note that
because the fold cost of sex is a comparative measure, a value of 1 means
equal rates and no cost.

figure 3. Population growth rates decreased both in facultative
sexuals and obligate asexuals with increasing period length.
However, the decrease was more pronounced in obligate asex-
uals, which caused the growth rates to cross at a period length
between 6.5 and 7 days (figure 3). In fact, at period lengths
above 7 days, obligate asexuals could not reproduce at all,
because at such high period lengths all females of the youngest
cohort died before they could leave any offspring. This
is caused by the fact that the life cycle length (LCL) in
B. calyciflorus, i.e. the time from first juvenile stage to last fertile
adult stage, was exactly 7 days (cf. transition matrix in elec-
tronic supplementary material, table $2). To probe further
into the mechanisms contributing to the pattern in growth
rates observed in figure 3, we fixed the period length at
7 days (i.e. the first period length at which the growth rate
of asexuals was lower than that of facultative sexuals) and
examined how growth rates of both reproductive modes chan-
