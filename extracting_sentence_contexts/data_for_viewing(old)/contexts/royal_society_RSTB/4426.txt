extension (see text-fig. 10), reveals in transverse section that it is composed of three
layers, viz., the outer stony or limiting layer, a middle stony or fibrous layer, and an
inner thin-walled layer. :

The outer stony layer consists generally of a single or a partly. double layer of large,
squarish cells, which average about 30 x 45, to 40 x 50p. These fit together in
close rank, and form a regular shell. Where two cells are in radial sequence they fill
together approximately the same space in a radial direction as their one neighbour.
The cells are oriented at approximate right angles to the main axis of the seed, and
as their walls are very thick, in transverse sections of the seed, the walls are
generally cut tangentially, and so the cells look solid,.and lumina are seldom
apparent. This can be seen in the photographs on Plate 21, fig. 17, and Plate 19,
figs. 7 and 8, and text-figs. 7, 8, 9, and 10, os. This fact affords the explanation of
Lienter’s interpretation of this layer in B. Morieret as being “fleshy,” for in his
