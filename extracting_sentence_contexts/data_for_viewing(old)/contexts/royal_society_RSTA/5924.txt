which holds in the limit of large Reynolds number v > 0 and subsequently small scales ¢ — 0. In
practice, (1.9) is observed to hold approximately over the inertial range; see figure 2 for evidence
from [23]. The 4/5-law captures some aspects of the turbulent cascade: energy is transferred
through scale by a cubic nonlinear flux term related to si (€) until it is removed, ¢ > 0, from the
system by infinitesimal viscosity.

In fact, the 4/5-law (1.9) fixes the scaling exponent p/3 in (1.6) via the statistical assumption
of monofractal scaling in Kolmogorov’s theory. On its face, this indicates that the turbulent fluid
velocity satisfies 5;u ~ 1/5 and so is ‘1/3 differentiable’, at least in some averaged sense. More
precisely, the fact that ¢ is a priori bounded by initial data and forcing via equation (1.3) ensures
that si ()/€ is controlled uniformly for small ¢. This suggests that some kind of a priori regularity
information—a ‘turbulent energy estimate’—might be extracted from the 4/5-law. Unfortunately,
aside from justifying the assumptions necessary for a rigorous derivation of (1.9), there are
two obstructions to realizing this hope: (i) the longitudinal structure function does not measure
velocity variations in all directions, only those aligned with the separation vector and (ii) the
integrand is not sign-definite. In particular, although a certain skewness is implied by the 4/5-
law (positive of ¢ means negativity of 5:u- @ in an averaged sense), it is conceivable that there
are large fluctuations which cancel in the integral to yield (1.9) but would disturb this relation if
the increments were replaced by their absolute values. Both of these issues prevent the control on
