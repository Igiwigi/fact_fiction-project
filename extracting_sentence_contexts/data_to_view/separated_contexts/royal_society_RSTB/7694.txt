Science is, of course, an on-going process. Future work may reveal facts that
support the conclusions reached here or go against them. The work on which these new
facts will be based may come from individuals or from institutions. Philosophical Transactions
will consider for publication all future material in this and other subject areas, regardless of
its provenance. We hope in this way to continue serving science and the society that ulti-
mately sanctions and finances all our research, as we have done for the past 339 years.
