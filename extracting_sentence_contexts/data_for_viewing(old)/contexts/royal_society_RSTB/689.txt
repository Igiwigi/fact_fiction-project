neither muscle nor tendon, the absence of action upon the former being probably
associated with the fact that the muscle tissue is, so to speak, habituated to the
presence of this gas. This is not, at any rate to like extent, the case with the
protoplasmic structures at the outer surface of the skin, and it is reasonable to
suppose that the action of CO, is almost exclusively upon this surface.

With the assumption that CO, acts principally, if not exclusively, upon the

structures of the epidermis, and that its action is, by lessening vital action, to cause
a diminution of the E.M.F. dependent upon such action, the facts arising out of
experiment became easily explicable.

In the normal case (Experiment A) the application of CO, causes, first a reduction
of the E.M.F. of the outer surface to such a degree that it is balanced by that of the
inner, so that there is no current, and by a continuance of its depressant action,
allows the E.M.F. generated at the inner surface (probably as the result of injury
during removal) to gain the upper hand, with the result that a current sets in in the
reverse direction to normal. AÃ©ration brings back activity to the protoplasm of the

ells of the outer surface, and with renewed action the negativity of injury of the
Sinner surface is again over-compensated, leading to a re-reversal of current back to
Baormal.
