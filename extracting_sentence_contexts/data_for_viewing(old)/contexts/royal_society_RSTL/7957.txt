chyma. But the most striking features of this section appear immediately beneath the
node. At this point we have a dense mass, convex externally, and consisting of very
large reticulated vessels (41, y), in which the vessels (9, 9') coming up from below sud-
denly disappear. This cluster of enlarged reticulated vessels terminates yery abruptly
at the node, as if truncated, having previously given off a divergent cluster (41, 2) to the
base of an adjoining branch (41, m), and from which a few spiral yessels alone are prolonged
into the branch, but between which and the cluster (z) whence they spring is placed
an extension (7) of the nodal septum which bounds the branch cluster (z) in the same
way that the main node (7) does the cluster y. These dense additions to the yascular
tissues in the neighbourhood of the node appear at first sight to represent the arched

* Sacns figures the snperficial arrangement of these yessels at the nodes of Fquisetum macimum ; it exactly
corresponds with that of the woody wedges in my fig. 2, a fact favouring the idea of close Equisetacean affinities,

vessels of the thickened woody zone in the same region of the Calamite; but when we
compare the two more minutely, we discover them to be yery different things, We have
een that, in the fossil genus, the woody zone is materially thickened at each node by
the addition of a number of arched vessels, which differ only in their increased numbers
from those of the internodes. There is no change in the character of the individual
yessels, nor interruption to the continuity of their course. The woody zone of the inter
node gradually thickens into a lenticular form as it ascends to the node, and as gradually
