Zlatev et al. [4] illustrate the difference between bodily mimetic communication in which a teacher performs
primary and secondary iconicity with the example of a sign an action for the benefit of a student. It is defined as follows:
where a whole body enactment represents the action of ham-
mering (primary iconicity)> and another sign, where the — (D1) The demonstrator actually performs the actions
