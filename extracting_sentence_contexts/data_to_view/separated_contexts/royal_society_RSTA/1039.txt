This process is governed by diffusion equations
and elasticity plays a minor role. It is why the theory of elasticity with growth [5] has been so
much debated. In addition, the fact that all geometric deformations have the scale of the samples
indicate that the theorist cannot use linear elasticity. After two decades of discussions about the
foundations of the modelling, the time has come to test the model in the full complexity of living
systems, addressing their dynamics and disorders. Four up-to-date biological systems have been
presented here where cells play a key role.
