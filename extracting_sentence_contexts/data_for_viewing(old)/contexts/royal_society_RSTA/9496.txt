because there is some tendency for the months of higher § in a year to occur together.
In 1890, for instance, the 6 months of largest S came from the second half of the
year, while in 1894 and 1900 the first half of the year contributed 5 out of the 6 months
in the first group. Taking this into account, and the smallness of the value of b/a
deduced in the case of R from Table XLIV., the natural inference would seem to be
that the value of R from ordinary days in a particular month depends less on the
value of § in that month than on the values of $ in the other months of the year.

This may mean nothing more than that the value of S on a particular day is a very
rough measure of the solar activity to which enhanced diurnal inequalities are due,
while the mean value of § from all days of the year affords a very exact measure.

The fact that the value of b/a derived from Table XLIV. in the case of R’ is so
much larger than that derived in the case of R, suggests that the solar influence is
more direct or immediate in the case of irregular than in the case of regular magnetic
changes.

Table XLV. shows the result of grouping the 182 months according to the monthly
mean value of 8. Notwithstanding the considerable number of months included in
the groups, the results of the first grouping in which the step in § is only 10 are
somewhat irregular. R and R’ show a decided tendency throughout to increase with
