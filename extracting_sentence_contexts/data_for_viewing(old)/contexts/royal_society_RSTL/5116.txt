force to act at any point of its line of direction on a rigid body.
Hence the effect of the force acting at P is symbolically represented by the force
U— lateral effect of translation, or U+u.U.

(75.) Symbol of a Couple.—Let the couple consist of two forces, U Fig. 33.
at the point , and —U at the point #': then these two forces are com- AD
pletely represented, as regards their effect on the rigid body, by the $ +a Ihe

expression W 0
(U+u.U)+(—U+u.(—U))
or (u—u').U,
which is the general symbol for a couple; as indeed is clear beforehand from the
fact, that the couple is that which translates the force U from the point (#') to the
point (), 4. e. along the line (u—u').
It will be generally simpler to employ the symbol in the form
u.U,
u here denoting, symbolically, the line drawn from the point of application of the
force (—U) to that of the force (U). The directriz of this, 7. e. the avis of the couple,
is D(u.U).
(76.) To combine a given Set of Couples —Let us put (se art. 15)
u=Te+yB+2y
U=X«+YBp+Zy.
Then we find, by lateral multiplication,
u.U=(vY—yXN)z.Þ+(yZ—2Y)B.y+(2X—2L)y .%.
Hence, if we suppose the given couples to be u.U, v.U', u”.U", &c., and if we
