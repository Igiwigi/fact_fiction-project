(iv) Planning under perfect (deterministic) information

Note that we can also minimize each scenario’s total cost as shown in equation (3.21). Here, the
planner assumes perfect information of the future and thus the associated (deterministic) solution
may represent an investment option that cannot be efficiently adapted if a different scenario
(which was, in fact, ignored) is realized. This case can also be considered as a base, reference
case:

(c) Illustrative example

(i) Input data

We study the electricity network depicted in figure 2 with three nodes (N1, N2 and N3),
three existing conventional generators (G1, G2 and G3), three existing lines (L12, L13 and L23)
