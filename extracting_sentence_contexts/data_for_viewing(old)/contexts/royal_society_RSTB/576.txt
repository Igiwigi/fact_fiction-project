On the Relation to the Anomodontia of the Fossil Animals termed Pelycosauria and
Cotylosauria.

In his catalogue of the Permian Reptiles of North America, Professor CopE
enumerates 15 genera and 39 species described by himself since 1877, which are
referred to a group named Pelycosauria. This group is combined with the Anomo-
dontia into an order named Theromorpha. Few of the American fossils have been
figured, so that their exact relation to the Anomodontia is not easily determined ;
but, in so far as I can judge from the description, few of the characters relied upon to
differentiate them sustain the author’s estimate of their importance in classification,
while their affinity to the Anomodontia is so close that I can realize no obstacle to
grouping the Pelycosauria as a sub-order of Anomodonts. I base this conclusion on
the following facts :—

(1) Professor Cops defines the Pelycosaurian scapular arch as consisting of scapula,
coracoid, and epi-coracoid, blended like an os innominatum. But Sir R. Owen, in
1876, in his ‘South African Catalogue,’ Plate 69, figs. 5, 6, figured a South African
specimen which shows this condition, and he regarded the fossil as Dicynodont.
Professor Corr remarks on the Mammalian character of the scapular arch, and states
that in Dimetrodon the coracoid is smaller than the epi-coracoid, as in Monotremes.

(2) The author also affirms that the pelvic arch is identical in structure with that
of the Anomodontia, and is considered to resemble Hehidna.

(3) In the limb bones reference is made to the possible presence of epiphyses in
