SIM is that it can be applied to samples prepared for standard fluorescence microscopy without
the need for additional sample preparation. It has no special requirements for the fluorophores
used for sample labelling.

SIM illuminates the sample with a periodic interference pattern with a periodicity close to the
optical diffraction limit of the optical imaging system.

A very important feature of SIM is the extremely efficient use of available photons, which,
combined with high imaging speed and new evaluation algorithms, also makes SIM one of the
most suitable techniques for live cell imaging.


SIM bypasses the Abbe/Rayleigh limit by exploiting the fact that fluororphores (as opposed
to scattering particles) react to excitation intensity by a proportional emission of incoherent
fluorescence. Super-resolution is achieved in SIM by the illumination of the object with a periodic
sinusoidal pattern. This multiplication in the spatial domain correlates to a convolution in the
frequency domain. By this, spatial frequencies of details originally too small to be resolved by
homogeneous wide-field illumination are shifted to lower frequencies that can be transmitted
through the microscope optics. This creates several overlapping copies of the original Fourier
transformed object. To separate these, several (usually three or five depending on the interference
pattern creation method) phase-shifted images are acquired. To obtain close to isotropic resolution
enhancement, the process is repeated several times for rotated gratings. For a two-dimensional
image, typically 9-15 single wide-field images are used. For more details, please see [4,5,11].
