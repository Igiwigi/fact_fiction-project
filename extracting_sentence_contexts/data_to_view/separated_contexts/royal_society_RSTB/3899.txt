2. The Phloem.—The phloem (Plate 33, fig. 46; Plate 32, fig. 42; Plate 11, fig. 13, ph)
is presumably the narrow zone surrounding the wood and passing outside the supposed
protoxylem-groups at the ends of the plate ; the tissue lying between protoxylem and
metaxylem must be regarded as conjunctive or xylem parenchyma. Apart from
position, however, it is impossible to distinguish between the two tissues ; the elements
have little to characterise them, beyond the fact that they are long and narrow ;
where measurable the cells are about 20-35 » in diameter; the lumina are usually
obliterated. The supposed phloem-zone is narrow throughout ; its apparent increase in thickness
at the ends of the bundle is probably due to the great development of the conjunctive
tissue in that region. On the flat side of the xylem, towards the middle of its
length, the phloem appears to be about four cells thick, and this may have been about
