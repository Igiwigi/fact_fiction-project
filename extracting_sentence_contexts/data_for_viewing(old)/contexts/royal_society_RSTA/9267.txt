We observe that the calculated ratios are always considerably smaller than the
actual ones, so that our model would show an even greater anisotropy than the wood
itself. This is undoubtedly due to the fact that the cross-sections of the cells are not
accurately circular, but often approach a rectangular or hexagonal shape, and that the
cells are not open, but either taper to a point or are closed in some other way.

However, the results seem to justify the conclusion that the form and arrangement
of the cells have a sufficiently large effect to account for the relative values of Hy,
and Ey.

Another fact, which is perhaps more significant, is that the theory suggests that the
ratio Ey/E, should increase with the cell-wall thickness, and therefore with the specific
gravity of the wood. â€˜This is certainly the case for the four woods already considered,
and there does not seem to be any obvious alternative explanation of this fact.
