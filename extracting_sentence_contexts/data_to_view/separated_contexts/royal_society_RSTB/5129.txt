The question of its homologies has been
discussed at great length by ALLIs (1915, 1918), and has also been dealt with recently
by ScHMALHAUSEN (1923) and Dr Brrr (19245). Commencing with the Selachians, there is little doubt that the hyomandibular of the
Sharks (Pleurotremata) represents the epal element of the hyoid arch. This conclusion,
which is based on a number of facts concerning the relations of the hyomandibular to
the neurocranium, and to the associated muscles, nerves and blood-vessels, is further
supported by the fact that an independent pharyngohyal cartilage has been observed in
the embryonic or adult stages of Stegostoma, Galeus, Mustelus and other genera (LUTHER,
1909, p. 18*; Sewerrzorr, 1923). ALLis (1915), while he agrees with this conclusion,
regards the hyomandibular of the Rays (Hypotremata) as the pharyngeal element. These fishes, however, present a number of features which show that they are clearly
modified and specialized Sharks, and it is scarcely conceivable that the articulation of
the hyoid arch with the cranium should be through a different element in the two groups.
