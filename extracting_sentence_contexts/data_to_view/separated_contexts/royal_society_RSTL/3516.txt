The very curious property possessed by this salt, when
applied of a certain strength, of rendering photographic paper, blackened by expo-
sure to light, snsceptible of being again whitened by the same agent, has been noticed
by Lassa16nE, Mr. Tairor and others, and was early encountered by myself. My at-
tempts to apply this property to the production of a positive photographic paper, (i. e. a
dark ground, on which the action of the light shall impress a bright image,) though oc-
easionally successful, and in one or two instances remarkably s0, have yet not enabled
me to state any precise proportions of ingredients, and mode of applying them, which
shall certainly produce a paper of the required character possessed of any degree of
permanence. In fact, nothing can be more variable and capricious than the results
obtained according to the different intensities of the solutions applied—the qualities
of the paper—the degree of darkening induced on the paper before the application
of the ioduretted solution —the state of the paper as to moisture or dryness, and other
circumstances. Nor will this appear strange when the complicated nature of the
action itself, when analysed as will be explained in the subsequent part of this paper,
is considered. Tt will there be shown that the total effect of a ray of white light on
iodic preparations is in fact the difference of two opposing actions, either of which
is susceptible of being exalted or enfeebled at pleasure by cireumstances under our
command, indeed, in a general way, but difficult to reproduce exactly at our pleasure.
