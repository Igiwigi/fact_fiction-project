Fog can be a vital source : =
of water, particularly in arid areas that receive little rainfall. : S

It would be beneficial for populations in these arid regions to develop a means to harvest fog 73
directly from the air. Such ideas are by no means new. In fact, there is evidence that suggests aed
hunter-gatherer groups were able to populate arid areas along the southern coast of Peru by 22
using fresh water from fog over 5000 years ago, though the collection method is unknown [14]. : Sg
Today, a common method for fog interception and harvesting uses nets which are able to provide : S
a supplemental source of water in arid regions across the globe (figure 4). Charities such as : Ss
FogQuest have installed polymer nets in Central and South America, Africa and South Asia. In : a

addition, to overcome the limitations of a two-dimensional net, new designs are being developed,
such as a tower by the charity Warka Water.
