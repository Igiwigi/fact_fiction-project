which they already contribute, and by the incentive and direction they may give to
future research.

Lastly, the chemistry of the subject will be found to offer many points of interest,
in regardâ€”to the variation in the percentage composition of the produce according to the
manure applied, to the description of plants developed, and to the character of their
development ; to the availableness of the constituents artificially supplied, and to the
amount and limit of the natural resources of the s0il, both actually and compared with
the results obtained when individual species are grown in arable culture.

Tt will be readily understood that the record, and the discussion, of the agricultural,
the botanical, and the chemical history of about 20 plots, in 20 different seasons, mus
involve much detail; and although it is obvious that facts special to anyone of the three
main divisions of the subject may require for their elucidation reference to those of one
or both of the others, it is still believed that it will conduce to clearness, and reduce
unavoidable repetition, to maintain the divisions proposed as far as possible. It may
_ further be explained that, in order to simplify the discussion, and as far as is consistent
with clearness to relieve it of embarrassing details, the whole of the numerical results
are systematically arranged in tables given in the Appendix, to which reference will
be made, and only such quotations or summaries will be embodied with the text as are
necessary for illustration.

PART I -THE AGRICULTURAL RESULTS.

In entering upon the diseussion of the s0-designated agricultural results, it is
