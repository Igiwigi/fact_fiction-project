cipice above it, however, seems to indicate fissure ; nor have I the slightest doubt
that the course of the Rhine in this neighbourhood has been determined by a very
extensive local disruption of the strata.

B and C. Specialties, Temperature, $c—There is, I believe, only one spring at
Pfeffers. I took its temperature at its point of rise from the rock. It is insipid, and
moderately copious. Its elevation is 2251 feet aboye the sea. I made particular in-
quiries of a resident priest as to its constancy of temperature and volume. He assured
me that the former varied buf little throughout the year, and estimated it at 294 R,
(= 98*7 F.), but that its quantity was by no means 80 constant ; its discharge in
summer being 29'8 Paris cubic feet per minute, and always diminishing towards
winter, when occasionally (as in winter 1831=2) he declared that it became quite dry.
This is a singular and important fact, and would almost force us to suppose that this
thermal water owes its origin to the neighbouring glaciers.

V. Baths of Nero, near Naples.

A. Geological Position, —The baths of Nero, commonly called Sudatorij di Tritoli,
occur close to the shore of the bay of Baja near Pozzuoli. They consist of yapour
baths cut from the solid tufaceous rock of volcanic formation. Perhaps the most re-
markable fact connected with their geological position, is the proximity of the Monte
