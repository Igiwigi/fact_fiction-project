in the ventral wall of the sinus; in the dorsal wall they are fewer and mostly of quite
small size. Still farther back, in sections taken through the valved openings between
the subthyroid and thyroid sinuses (Plate 2, fig. 11), the larger vesicles are aggregated
mainly around the first afferent vessels (which at this level lie free within the thyroid
sinus) and within the ventral and lateral walls of the sinus ; in its dorsal wall they are

relatively few and small. As the point is approached at which the second afferent
branchial vessels leave the thyroid sinus, a complex.mass of vehicles appears in the roof
of the sinus (Plate 2, fig. 12, m.). This mass is of some apparent thickness and density, but
is, in fact, like the rest of the gland, composed of a relatively thin layer of vesicles
surrounding complex offshoots of the general cavity of the sinus, forming a sponge-like
intermixture of lymph spaces, and baulks and trabeculee of connective tissue, within
which lie the vesicles. Towards the hinder end of the gland this mass of vesicles more
or less surrounds the ventral aorta and roots of the afferent branchial vessels, forming
lateral masses in folds connecting these vessels to the lateral walls of the sinus. In
other parts at the hinder end of the gland, vesicles, though present in most parts of the
walls of the sinus, are relatively few and small.

It is to be particularly noticed that the vesicles everywhere, even when, as just stated,
they are apparently massed together to a considerable depth, form in reality quite a
thin layer close to the cavity of the thyroid sinus.
