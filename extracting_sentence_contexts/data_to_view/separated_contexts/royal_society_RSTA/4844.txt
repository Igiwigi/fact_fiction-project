We construct again empirical DT and ALMT phase diagrams and display them in figure 3
together with the theoretical Gaussian-case phase-transition curves for LP. Also in this case, the
CT phase diagrams are almost identical to the Gaussian case, in terms of both the empirical phase-
transition curve and the width as indicated by the 5% and 95% contour lines. In fact, the similarity
is even larger, as the cyan 50% contour in the CT case coincides with the theoretical transition
curve, except at the bottom left corner of the DT phase diagram, as before caused by having
only one or two CT projections. In accordance with the theoretical curves, we see that even fewer
samples suffice for recovery in the non-negative case compared to before.
