“The whole of the process involved in the regeneration of nerve fibres suggests
strikingly that surface tension is primarily involved. Indeed, the development in the
first place of the axon from the embryonic nerve cells is, it must be inferred, due to a
high surface tension on the latter, accompanied by a low tension at the terminal
point of the extending axon. The fact that the axon is maintained throughout the
life of the normal nerve cell as an extension of the cytoplasm of the latter is also an
indication of the persistence of a constant difference between the surface tension of
the surface of the cell body and that of the surface of the axon. That this is not
wholly a prioristic is known by the results of microchemical investigation of the
nerve cell and nerve fibres. The author's observations published seven years ago
showed that potassium is abundant along the course of the axon and apparently
on its exterior surface, while it is present only in traces in the nerve cell itself.”

D’autres auteurs, parmi lesquels il faut citer en premiére ligne Macponatp et
puis Atcock et Lyncu, ont trouvé du potassium dans la fibre nerveuse.
