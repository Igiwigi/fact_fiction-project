From the comparatively high phosphorus content of 0-108 per cent. in No. 31/D.4
there seems no doubt that wrought iron was used as the base.

Of the high carbon alloys, each of those analysed is comparatively low in phosphorus
and, except in the case of specimen No. 32/D.5, remarkably uniform, namely between
0-030 and 0-032, No. 32/D.5 containing 0-051 per cent. The possibility that

No. 20/C.1-9 may represent some of the base material used in making the high carbon
steels was therefore made more probable by this fact. Special care was in the circum-
stances taken with this specimen, the sample for analysis being taken by drilling along the
central axis so as to preserve the exterior appearance.

Prior micro-examination of a transverse section, however, disclosed segregation
of carbon. Clearly, therefore, any carbon figure obtained from the drillings could not
be truly representative of the material, and no analysis of it for carbon was therefore
made. This applies also to the iron, since the iron percentage is dependent upon
variations in the carbon. Special elements as in other cases were, however, analysed
for, but beyond 0-15 per cent. of copper nothing was found. This small amount of
copper the author is inclined to regard as accidental and insufficient to justify the
inclusion of specimen No, 20/C.1-9 among the alloy steels.
