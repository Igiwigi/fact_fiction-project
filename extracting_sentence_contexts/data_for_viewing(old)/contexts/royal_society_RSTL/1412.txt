the caves of Scharzfels and Alterstein, mentioned by BLu-
MENBACH. ( Archaeologia Telluris, p. 15.)

The fact mentioned by M. Cuv1ies, of the same hyzna being
common to the caves and gravel of France and Germany,
and that ascertained by myself, of the Ursus spelzus oc-
curring in the gravel of Upper Austria, proves both these
extinct species to have been the antediluvian contemporaries
of the extinct elephant and rhinoceros; there is therefore no

that was occasionally inhabited by such hyzenas and bears.

With respect to the analogies of the diluvian sediment and
the 8talactite in Germany and Yorkshire, in the case of the
open caves that have been disturbed and ransacked for centu-
ries, it is hopeless to expect evidence of what was the precise
