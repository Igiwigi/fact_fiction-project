columns was always marked and quite definite, and merely depended in intensity
upon the conditions ‘stated below. ‘For instance, applying the electrodes to the
surface of the postero-external column in the 5th lumbar segment of ‘the dog on the
left side produced lateral flexion of the spinal colunm of the same side, flexion and
adduction of the hip, flexion of the knee and toes, and movement in the tail (flexion

to the same side). But of the facts observed the chief was the very local effect
which would be obtained by varying the point stimulated. Thus stimulation of a point
1 millim. centrally or laterally of a given point often produced an entirely different
resulting movement, or no response at all, which fact is clearly of much importance in
showing that with the above strength of current the restriction of the stimulus to
one point must be sufficiently well obtained.

2. Mechanical.

_ As a means of controlling the observations derived from electrical excitation,
mechanical stimulation was sometimes employed in examining the nerve roots, and
was evoked by pinching the tissues with fine forceps. The results obtained were
precisely the same.

The results obtained by direct excitation of the cord will now be grouped as
follows :—
