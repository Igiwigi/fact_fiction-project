H' H? views looking
down into the chest;
a transverse section.

Inspiration.

Diagrams G! and G? represent side views, and H' and H? views as if looking
downwards into the chest, of the rib of an Ass, as in expiration G!, H', and inspiration
G2, H?. The downward curve of the upper edge in expiration, G!, becomes in G?,
inspiration, a slightly upward curve; G' presents a flat surface, G? a thin edge. In
H', expiration, there is a slight curve on the inner surface ; in H?, inspiration, the
curve is deepened; and the flat surface of the rib is presented instead of the edge, as
in HP. In fact that curve that looked upward in expiration G! looks inward in inspi-
ration H?, and the lateral surface in G?, expiration, becomes in H?, inspiration, the
superior surface.

41. On inspiration. The oblique internal surface of the superior ribs is more nearly
horizontal. Diagram Ãž P.

In the Pig, the Sheep, the Calf, and the Ass, the direction of the inner surface of
the ribs is beautifully adapted to the lungs. The lungs gradually narrow from their
body upwards to the summit ; the interior of the chest forms as it were a dome at its
upper part, to contain the upper lobes; the inner surface of the rib, which on ex-
piration is nearly vertical, becomes on inspiration much more oblique. The dome
of the chest is thus increased.
