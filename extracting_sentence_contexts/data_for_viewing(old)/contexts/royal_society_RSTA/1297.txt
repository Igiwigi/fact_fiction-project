liquidity approaches a fairly stable level of 185 trades, on average, between 1 and 2h after gate
opening.


The total trading volume peaks at 58 GW shortly after gate opening and steadily declines to
5.6 GW 12 min after gate opening. 15 min after gate opening, total trading volume rises to 13 GW
while it amounts to 3.5 GW 30 min after gate opening. Comparing trading volume and the number
of trades at these points in time shows that the surge in trading activity involves relatively little
trading volume. Subsequently, the total trading volume keeps a quite constant and low level
around 1.5GW until 2h after gate opening.

Thus, liquidity of 15-min contracts is high close to gate opening and drops substantially during
the first 12 trading minutes. This behaviour may be explained by the fact that market participants
initialize their positions. In the sequel, little volume is traded and thereby only minor adjustments
are made to the open positions. Generally, liquidity remains poor until the last trading hour prior
to gate closure as the forecasts of fundamentals are still relatively inaccurate.

3. Methodology

We aim at modelling the asymmetric response of 15-min intraday electricity prices to explanatory
variables, in particular, to renewable forecast changes depending on the slope of the merit order
curve. We suggest an extension of the econometric model by [2] to overcome its weaknesses and
employ a threshold regression model to calibrate our model to market data.
