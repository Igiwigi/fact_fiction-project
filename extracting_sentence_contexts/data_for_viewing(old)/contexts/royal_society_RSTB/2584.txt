been done in England by Mosexey, in Germany by Kocu and Herper. In referring
to the papers of Bournge and Fowtrr, I direct my attention here to points which
concern the Madreporarian skeleton. Morphological and anatomical features will be
referred to in the course of this paper.

The excellent microscopic transverse sections of wall and septa deserve to ‘be
noted, they are among the best which have been given. Also the various terms
for the median area of the septum—primary streak, primary septum, primary spines
—are scarcely used by those authors. The particular areas in question are fitly
called in general “centres of calcification,” whether the area be seen as a “line” or a
“point” in transverse section. The “ centre of calcification” was, with those authors,
a neutral term, taking nothing for granted about the dark line (ex. Zuphyllia
Flabellum) or the dark points (ex. Mussa) themselves, but indicating merely the fact
observed that the calcareous fibres, in all cases, diverged outwards from those areas.

Both Bourne and Fow:er had abundant opportunity of confirming Koca’s state-
ment that the skeleton was entirely of ectodermal origin. At the same time, they
accepted Hrrper’s term of calicoblast for the lime-forming cells of the ectodermal
layer. They farther agreed with Koon in regarding the calicoblast as a secreting
cell, separating out the calcareous material which gave rise to the skeleton, while
itself remaining intact as an organic cell of the polypal ectoderm. The observations
made and figured by Herter of calicoblasts containing fully-developed fibrous
deposit, and the nucleus shrunken or vanished, were entirely discredited both by
Bourne and Fowzer. Another explanation was given by Fow er of the curious,
elongated: cells with fibre-bundles, observed by HetpEr ; while the roundish cells with
