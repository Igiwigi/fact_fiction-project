muriatic acid. It is scarcely affected by chlorine, except
moisture be present, when a little muriate is gradually formed,
When the powder is put into liquid ammonia, minute glo=
bules of -air are evolved from it, and after some time it ac-
quires fulminating properties. The quantity of air I have
hitherto obtained in this way, has been too small to allow me
to ascertain its nature with precision. When the powder is
brought in contact with ammoniacal gas, a crackling noise‚Äù
is produced, and it becomes red hot and scintillates; but by
this treatment, its external appearance is scarcely altered,
though it undergoes a partial decomposition. The powder
is immediately decomposed by the agency of alcohol. This
fact is shown in an interesting manner by moistening different
substances, such as paper, sand, cork, &c, with alcohol, and
placing the smallest particle of the powder on them; it hisses,

a sufficient degree of heat is produced to reduce and ignite
the platinum, and it remains in a state of ignition until the
alcohol is consumed. During the agency of alcohol on the
powder, acetic acid is produced. This is shown by putting
a little of the powder on a paper filter and moistening it with
alcohol ; a moderate action takes place, and in a few minutes,
