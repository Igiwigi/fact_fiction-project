conical—the name applied is always the same. One or two noteworthy attempts
have been made to make some systematic use of the occurrence of these granulations
(I refer to E>warps and Haime and to Mimascuewrrz), but these attempts have
confined themselves to the position of the granulations on the surfaces, in short, to
the occurrence and external arrangement of prominent granulations, and have
overlooked all cases where the granulations were not of suflicient size to obtrude
themselves on the observer’s notice.

I should define a granulation as a protuberance on any part of the skeletal surface,
caused by the emergence at that part of one or more fascicles of fibres. Such a defini-
tion would include the so-called echinule on various types of “ coenenchyme,” and the
adornments on the wall and costs of many Turbinolids, as well as the “granulations”
on the septa. The fundamental fact in the definition is the relation of the granulation
in all its forms to fascicles of fibres—and, therefore, to one or more definite centres of
active calcification, already fixed at the laying-down of the very first growth-lamella
at that part of the skeleton.

It will be remembered that the “growth-lamella” is simply the term I have
applied to the completely calcified layer of “calicoblast” cells. Hence we may
describe the building-up of granulations in terms of the calicoblast. A group of
actively-dividing calicoblasts, at any part of the ectodermal layer of the polyp or
ccenosare, will give rise ultimately to a corresponding group of calcified cells, whose
fibrous elements arrange themselves with respect to a definite centre or centres
of calcification. Tach new calicoblastic layer behaves in the same way until a thick
shelly growth has accumulated over the original centre or centres of active calci-
