In 1983, Hartle & Hawking introduced a radical approach using path integral methods to
describe the problem of initial conditions in quantum cosmology introduced in the 1960s [21]. That approach, called the no-boundary proposal for the wave function of the universe, suggested a
beginning of the universe not as dramatic as that appearing in the standard model of the universe. In fact, there is a beginning but the initial singularity is now replaced by a situation where time is
imaginary, there is a smooth passage to a quantum regime, a creation ‘from nothing’. The Hartle—
Hawking wave function also peaks as most probably states those that describe infinitely large and
empty universes. However, it soon became clear that other, equally probable and similarly constructed,
‘creation-from-nothing’ proposals are possible, but with completely different predictions.
