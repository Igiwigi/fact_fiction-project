The step for the six lowest classes is only 12°5y, answering roughly to 2’°5 in D, or
half the step employed in the corresponding tables in my previous paper. For the
next five classes the step is 25y. The twelfth class has a step of 50y, the thirteenth
of 250y, while the last class includes the few ranges—none in D—which exceeded
500y. It requires a large number of classes to show the distribution satisfactorily
near the lower end of the scale. Towards the upper end of the scale; the occurrences
are so few that the employment of a very large number of classes with small steps
would have been a useless complication. It would, in fact, require a very much
longer period ‘of years to fix the exact law of incidence for ranges exceeding 200y.
To facilitate intercomparison, Table LIV. includes results for the whole year from the
three elements. The 11 years, the four years representing sunspot maximum, and the
three years representing sunspot minimum are treated separately. ‘Table LIV.
likewise gives results from the three elements for the three seasons, derived from the
whole 11 years.

The results in Table LIV. are shown graphically in fig. 18. The number of days
in each class was expressed as a percentage of the total number of days included in
all the classes, and ordinates were drawn proportional to these percentages, due
allowance being made for the difference between the steps in the earlier and later
classes. The graphical representation was not carried beyond the 9th class, whose
