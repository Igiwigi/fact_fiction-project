Systematic PosiTIoN OF THE STROBILUS.

Tn a paper on the leaves of Williamsonia, published in 1897, I wrote : “ Although
we have not as yet discovered any examples of Williamsonia gigas showing internal

structure, there are many reasons for believing that this Lower Oolite fossil
represents an inflorescence very closely allied to that of Bennettites Gibsonianus.”*
The recent work of Prof. Naruorst,t so far, at least, as regards the female organs,
and it is these with which we are alone concerned, has not revealed any facts
necessitating a modification of this opinion. It is by no means easy to decide
between Williamsonia and Bennettites as the more appropriate generic designation
for the Scotch fossil. The question of Bennettites versus Cycadeoidea is hardly
germane to the present discussion, as we are dealing with a detached fertile shoot,
and, whatever force there may be in the arguments advanced by Warp and
Wietanp in favour of the latter and older name for Mesozoic trunks bearing fertile
branches, the use of BuckLaNnn’s genus (Cyeadeoidea) would be inappropriate in the
case of a single strobilus. The difficulty might be shirked, not altogether without
reason, by adopting the pis aller of instituting a new genus on the ground of the
substitution of long hairs for the usual multicellular scales, hitherto regarded as
characteristic of Mesozoic Bennettitales; but, in view of the meagreness of our
knowledge of the structure of undoubted Williamsonias, which we know have hairy
