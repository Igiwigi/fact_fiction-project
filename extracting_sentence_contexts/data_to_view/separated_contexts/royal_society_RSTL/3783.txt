The result of my research is at variance with the description of their structure given
by Dr. S110N; it corroborates Dr. S1Mox only in the general fact of the existence of
these animals and their diversity of form, while it offers several new and original ob-
servations for consideration. Among the latter I may refer especially to the anatomy
of the head, which Dr. Simon regards as composed of certain moveable organs, but
which in reality is distinct from those organs ; the discovery of eyes; of a power of
retracting the head within the thorax; of ova; of a remarkable embryonic form :
and of the progressive development of the young animal.
