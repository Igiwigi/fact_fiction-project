the characters of the discharge from the single electrical cell are those of all efferent
cells, then the persistence of a central rapid discharge in muscular and other reflexes
would imply that the activity of all the members of the groups of cells is not
simultaneously evoked, but would find its analogy rather in company than
in battalion volley-firing. In this way, the extremely rapid but variable central
discharge from the thousands of nerve cells of Torpedo or Gymnotus might be pro-
duced. It seems, in the light of the present results, highly improbable that each
nerve cell in these fish continues discharging at the rate of eighty to one hundred per
second, which is the possible rate of response of the Torpedo and Gymnotus organ to
the reflex central activity. The minimum central delay of â€˜008 second in the single
Malapterurus electrical nerve cell may well be a true expression of central propaga-
tion time from the afferent to the efferent side of all efferent nerve cells, since this
generalisation conflicts with no existing facts. The further susceptibility to fatigue
shown by increased delay, is a phenomenon which not improbably occurs in all other
similar nerve structures, and though often masked by the number of cells and the
number of fresh central paths along which the central discharge can take place, this
alteration in conductivity may be, and we suggest probably is, a fundamental charac-
teristic of the physiological mood of the ingoing side of each efferent cell. In other
words, central activity would, on this hypothesis, be succeeded by localised transient
decrease in central conductivity.

The increase in the rapidity of central conduction which appears to exist in the
case of muscular reflexes, can, if this fatigue characterises every efferent cell, still be
explained. For a diversion of the ingoing nerve-change into other and fresh paths is
rendered possible in all reflexes except the special one which forms the subject of this
