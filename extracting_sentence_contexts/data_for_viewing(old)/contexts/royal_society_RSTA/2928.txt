Here, e is the eccentricity of the elliptical contact area between two cylinders and equals
v¥1-(b/a)*, with a and b being the semi-major and semi-minor axis length, respectively.
Moreover, the ratio can be expressed as b/a ~ [(1 + cosa)/(1 — cos@)]~7/3. K(e) and E(e) are the
complete elliptical integrals of the first and second kinds, respectively. In this way we use the fact
that a change in the contact angle leads to a change in the contact stiffness, and thus we can easily
tune the stiffness gradient in the system.

For the first case of the functionally graded configurations considered in this study, we
maintain a contact angle of 2° at the start of the chain (between the first and second cylinders
from the top) and an angle of 90° at the end of the chain (between the 39th and 40th cylinders
from the top). The rest of the contact angles are chosen such that the contact stiffness coefficient B
from equation (3.1) varies linearly along the chain from 7.27 x 10!°Nm~'5 to 4.68 x 10? Nm7!°.
The higher the contact angle is, the lower the stiffness becomes. Therefore, this represents a case
of a linear decrease in stiffness along the chain. For the second case, we simply reverse the contact
angles along the chain, so that it represents a case of a linear increase in stiffness. We ignore any
