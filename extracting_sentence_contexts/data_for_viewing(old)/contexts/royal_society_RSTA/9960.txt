telescope-axis was at the same horizontal height as the jet, the vertical plane through

the telescope-axis will here, too, as a closer examination shows, be perpendicular to

the vertical plane containing the jet and go through a summit when the vertical

spider-line goes through the middle of the bright line’at the same time as this falls
together with the minor axis of the ellipse.

The circumstance that the wave-amplitudes on account of the viscosity of the
liquid are decreasing in direction from the orifice has the effect that the distance OA
between the focus-lines and the jet is not the same everywhere. While this fact is
not of great importance when measuring the wave-lengths on a short jet-piece, it will,
when measuring on very long jet-pieces (as in the table, p. 310) have the effect that
the focussing of the telescope cannot be kept constant during the measuring, and the
readings of the single summits could therefore, in this case, not be executed with
quite as great accuracy as mentioned above.

The differences between the readings indicate the distances between the projections
of the summits on a horizontal plane. Dividing the mentioned differences by cos a,
« being the slope of the jet at the place in question, we therefore get the distances
