The second enclosure was alone used for higher pressures, it being, as we shall see, of
stronger construction. Apart from the effect of actual pressure, that of the sudden impact or blow given
by the more rapid explosives has to be considered. As will be seen below, some
mixtures of compressed coal gas and oxygen develop their full pressure in something
like one ten-thousandth of a second and, in fact, occasionally detonate. It is diffieult
to estimate the actual strain produced by a force so suddenly applied.* When we
consider that the present work comprised the repeated explosion of such mixtures, it
will be seen that exact calculation becomes impossible. In all probability, during the
course of the first few explosions of this kind the part of the material nearest the
inner surface is strained to beyond its limit of elasticity, and therefore yields.
