The precariousness and difficulty,
wever, attending the carrying out of this observation, has precluded other experi-
_ amenters from repeating it.
_ Although osmotic actions may be concerned with the evaporative function of the
| leaf, i.c., in the transference of water into the protoplasm-filled cells ; still it is very
| probable that surface tension forces developed upon the surfaces of walls coming in
direct contact with air diffusion currents are responsible princjpally for the tensile
= forces displayed by the leaf. The fact that transpiration is not only accelerated by
direct sunshine but even more influenced by warm dry winds, supports the view that
éyolution of vapour at the leaf obeys the general laws of evaporation from a moist
surface. _ It has, we believe, before now been pointed out that spontaneous evaporation at
the surface of a liquid into an unsaturated gas, such as the atmosphere, is of the
“sorting demon” class of molecular actions.
