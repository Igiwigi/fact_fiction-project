X denotes the equations X with 6,°—p substituted for 6’. Then the equation Y,
will, when %',... are replaced by «,',... and 6,’,..., 0° by 6,',..., 0:', become the
equation A,Xp4,

Consider now the equation Z,; it is independent of 6,", 2,',..., and therefore reduces
to a simple numerical constant which must be zero (p. 13).

Lastly, an operator A; may be defined so that the equation A,X is where

But Y isa polynomial in 6,*. It can therefore be only of the first degree, since
A,Y, is independent of 6,*; is, in fact, the same as Z,, viz., zero, so that Y, does not
contain @,°. It must then, like Z,, be only a constant, and must therefore vanish
identically, so that Y, = 0 gives a further “ equation of condition.”

Hence again X; cannot contain 6,', and the operator A,-, connecting it with Y,
shows that it cannot contain @',;. Thus X, again must be a vanishing constant,
giving another ‘ equation of condition.”

Similarly, starting with the corresponding equation of the fourth column, we
find A,X,=0, so that X, must be independent of 6,1. Also A,-,X, will vanish
identically, so that X, is independent of 6',-,, and similarly it is independent of
