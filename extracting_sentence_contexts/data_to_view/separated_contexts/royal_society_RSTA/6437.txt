To specify the function ¢(7), we need to introduce the following sets
Z* ={p: Lp) =0, tImp>0}. (3.11)

We can then write the explicit solution of the problem in the following form:

where we used the fact that the point p=0 should be passed by the integration contour from
below, see [19] for more details. The typical strain profiles are shown in figure 5a; these solutions are admissible in the sense
that the critical strain is passed only once. To find the velocity distribution u(y), we need to solve
the equation v(7) = —V du(n)/dn, which in the Fourier space reads
