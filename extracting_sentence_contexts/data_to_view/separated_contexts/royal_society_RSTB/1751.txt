The
© shorter the vertical cathetus, the narrower the angle—that is, the smaller that age-stratum out of which
2 the determinated sex may select his consort in order to obtain the greatest relative natality. Now we find
that this angle is for the female curve of 143°, for the male of 24}°, that is, the male shows a selecting
latitude which is, in the average, } time greater than that of the females.t Thus, it is possible to
& characterize the general average course of these complex relations by the simple indication of the
degrees of an angle. By this selecting latitude we ought not to understand the known social fact,

% With different nations this physiological angle may be different, as, for instance, the angle of
P| Camper, or any other anthropometrical measurement. If such observations are established also for other

g 10., On the Best Age Distance and om the Best Marriage Age.

3 As, in consequence of the structure of the diagrams A and B, it is not possible to
AQ judge of the age distance immediately by the eye, that is by the length of the ordi-

* The kind of adjustment used above is undoubtedly a very rough one; but in the present case,
where we haye to do only with two curves of one city, and where the chief intention is more to charac-
terize the method than to please by circumstantial calculations, I allowed myself to follow the easiest
way. It is also probable that, instead of one single average, we ought to establish different ones, accord-
ing to the different periods of life.
