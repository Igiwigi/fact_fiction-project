To represent vehicles’ inertia, dynamic or second-order models may be
constructed where formula (3.1) is supplemented with an equation for the
acceleration (i.e. the total derivative of the velocity)

0,0 + vd,0=F(p, InP, Ourp,-..,V, 020, OmV,-.-). (3.4)

As a matter of fact, most models in the literature can be written in the
specific form

djvu + vd,v= ZVle) —v) +N (p, dcp, Ixxp, O20, OxxV). (3.5)

The first term on the right-hand side corresponds to relaxation to a density-
dependent optimal velocity given by the decreasing function V(p) with a
relaxation time T. The limit T— 0 suggests a connection with equation (3.3).
Note that this idea also appears in microscopic models as explained further below.
The second term is such that MN’ =0 for constant density and velocity, in which
case equation (3.3) still holds. This term may be constructed using fluid dynamical
analogies and usually contains a ‘pressure term’ that is proportional to —0,p/p
