where the supply is abundant and the local demand small, so that the vessels are
filled, whereas in a region where the loss by transpiration is excessive, the appearance
of air bubbles in the vessels partially blocks the upward flow and increases the
lateral exudation until the local needs are supplied. SrrasBurGER attempted to
show that the flow of fluids through the vessels of wood was dependent upon their
viscosity, by driving such liquids as water, turpentine, alcohol, ether, and benzole
through short lengths of stem under similar heads and noting the time of formation
of a drop in each case. STRASBURGER’s method is vitiated by his assumption
that the drops of the different liquids were of the same size, which is not the case,
and he also forgets that the different densities of the liquids cause the weight
of the columns in the vessels to vary. Nevertheless he found that the number
of drops passing through in a given time was approximately proportional to the
viscosity of the liquids used, As a matter of fact, the values obtained for the
viscosity by this method depend largely upon the order in which the different liquids
are passed through the stem, even when the actual volume escaping is measured.
Thus water preceding turpentine or benzole gives absurdly different results to water
following these liquids, and to a less extent the same applies with alcohol and ether.
The re.ation between flow and viscosity can be best shown by comparing the flow
of water at different temperatures, as has already been done.
