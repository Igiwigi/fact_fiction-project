concave,) or assign equal curvatures to both its surfaces, &c.
such limitation is equivalent to assigning given values to
both its radii, and the terms depending on that lens in equa-
tion (w) pass into the given part of the equation.

20. Let us next consider the equations (u) and (v). The
latter does not involve the radii of the lenses, but only their
powers, being in fact when developed.

In a double object-glass, this equation will be incompatible
with the equation ozp L+p' L' expressing the condition of
achromaticity, and must of course be sacrificed, the latter
being of paramount importance.* It is in fact a very secon-
dary consideration to satisfy this condition in telescopes. In
the microscope, however, where D is necessarily a quantity
