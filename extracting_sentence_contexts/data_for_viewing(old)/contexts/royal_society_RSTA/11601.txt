on the assumption of an exceedingly rapid fall of pressure in the space below the
piston when the plug G is driven up. If we make this assumption, the force driving
the piston is always some hundreds of times its weight, and its initial acceleration
some hundreds of time “g.” Even an average acceleration of 100g would enable the
2 centirs. to be travelled in about 745 of a second.

Although the time taken may actually be considerably greater than this, these
considerations are sufficient to show that it is likely to be exceedingly short.

Further, the piston must be moving with constantly increasing velocity till brought
to a sudden stop at the constriction into which it fits.

The fact that contact takes place simultaneously over a considerable area, probably
saves the tube from being broken by the blow it receives from the piston. The film
of water which covers both surfaces, doubtless helps to break the shock. On two
occasions, a machine was made only slightly larger than the one whose dimensions
are given above, but in each case it was shivered by the impact almost the first time
the piston was allowed to fly. More than one machine was useless, owing to the
piston being driven so tightly home when the expansion was made, that all efforts
failed to release it. To avoid this latter defect, it was found necessary to make the
constriction a very sudden one. Great care has also to be taken to make it perfectly
symmetrical ; otherwise there is almost certain to be a space left between the piston
and some part of the wall of the tube just above the constriction. In this, air-bubbles
are apt to be entangled when the piston flies into the constriction. These may work
their way up into A, and in addition they cause a splashing of the water by their
