dextrals. We also tried to make comparisons at Merton (London tap water) and Leeds (soft
moorland water), but breeding was unsatisfactory in both places: so far as they go,
the data show no effect on E-ness. We have, too, the fact that annual fluctuations (statistically real) in brood size and
percentage of dextrals occur in < strains which we should class as pure lines. Thus in
672 (‘Table VI) we have—
