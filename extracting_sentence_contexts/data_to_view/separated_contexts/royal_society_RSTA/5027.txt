The high density of d-electron
states of a transition metal makes for a large contribution to the magnetic susceptibility of certain
transition metals, and is essential for the ferromagnetism of Fe, Co and Ni. This is also important
for the occurrence of superconductivity in V, Nb and so on, as we will now illustrate [33].

5. Theoretical concepts

These high density of d states at the Fermi energy (figures 4 and 5) for many of the first-
row transition metals might be expected to make for a high electrical conductivity, but, in fact,
the reverse is true and they exhibit rather high electrical resistivity [2,3,31]. The acknowledged
explanation is that the d band is narrow and has to accommodate up to 10 electrons when
compared with the s bandâ€™s two [35]. In such bands, the 3d band, electrons move sluggishly
owing to their low itinerant electron mobilities and, interestingly, contribute little to the flow
of electric current in these metals at temperatures in their normal (non-superconducting) state.
