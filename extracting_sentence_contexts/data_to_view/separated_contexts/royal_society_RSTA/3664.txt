This feature will allow us
to present complete results for all R/t and v. The range of applicability of the results is limited
to sufficiently large R/t, as will be made clear. The equations of shallow shell theory make use
of the fact that the slopes of the shell are shallow relative to a base plane lying below the region
near the pole where the buckling deflections occur. These equations are not listed here but they
can be found in [10,11] and the dimensionless form referred to above for spherical shells appears
in [12,13].
