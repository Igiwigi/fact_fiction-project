will be different and, therefore, the mass transfer mode will be different, which is in agreement
with the arguments presented in [30].

It should be noted that in this paper we consider the case when rf — 00, and, hence, tp — oo. As
a result, the condition s(t) < oo will be satisfied for all moments of time. From the estimate for the
effective radius (radius of influence) of major pores obtained above, it follows that r5 ~ r?/ (2+),
Hence, for small values of @ and small r, the diffusion in the matrix in r direction exhibits a regular
Fickian character. In other situations, accounting for the fact that 2/(2 + 6) <1, the anomalous
non-Fickian diffusion, which is called subdiffusion, takes place. It will be shown further that in
direction perpendicular to r, the following estimate is true: y? ~ c!~4*/@+*), which justifies that in
this direction the mass transport is subdiffusive as well.

Having an expression (2.17) for u(r, t) and accounting for Duhamel’s theorem [31], solution
of the boundary value problem (2.13)-(2.16) can be readily presented in the following form:

u(r, t) = 2 I, eply, E)e** ur (r,t — E)dé. (2.18)

Accounting for the formulae (2.12) and (2.18), the mass flux on the wall of the major pore,
which is defined by the derivative of the function cf(r, t) with respect to ras r > 0, can be readily
found as follows:
