The conclusions drawn from these experiments were as follows :-—

(1) The increase in time of coloration of the KI “ droplet’ as the length of the tube
was increased was partly due to the removal of spray of liquid, but the experiments
with glass wool show that this removal was nearly complete at 35 cm distance.

The Griess ‘‘droplet,”’ however, showed much less decrease than the KI “droplet”. The
apparent concentration after the spray had condensed was about four times that
determined by the KI “droplet.’” This was due to the presence of SO, which would
have affected the KI and not the Griess tests. (The fact that the spray affected the
KI more than the Griess, seemed to suggest that other oxidizing agents were
present besides NO,.)

(2) The effect of washing the gases at t.d.c. + 50° was to give the same apparent
concentration for both types of “ droplet,” so that this process removed the inhibitors.

(3) The results with cyclohexane (which appeared to be fairly free from sulphur)
showed that a certain amount of oxidizing spray was present at — 7°, and that
washing at -++ 50° merely removed NO,.

(4) From certain other experiments the use of petrol to which aldehydes had been
added appeared to contaminate the valve and delay future tests. This effect on
