After smearing thinly with vaseline the pressure rose three days afterwards
from 16 to 36 centims. in four hours, and after smearing thickly with vaseline changed
from 16 to 29 centims. in 16 hours. On attaching the receiver to a branch of a poplar 50 feet above the ground, the
pressure rose from 15 to 23 centims. in half an hour in one case, and from
13 to 24 centims. in another in the same time. This was on September 26, in England,
and in spite of the fact that the stem contained much water. Thus, a branch
0'7 centim. diameter from the top of the tree contained 54 per cent. of water, and
a similar one contained 55:9 per cent. after water had been passed through for
one hour. Similar results were given by branches at the base of the tree, and
differences of only 3-5 per cent. in the percentage of water existed between freshly cut
basal branches, and ones through which water had been passed.
