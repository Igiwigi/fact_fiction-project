stay below one. The latter in turn has a consequence that the free boundary is also smooth from
outside.

We shall here consider the case of Lipschitz free boundaries and then derive local Cl”
regularity. The main idea is to use the approach described in the section of minimal surfaces,

W71t should be remarked that in general there is no uniqueness for our problem, and solutions may cross each other.
Nevertheless, the solutions cannot have contact points between the free boundaries. This is an important ingredient in
constructing a continuous family of sub-solutions that are instrumental for improving the cone of monotonicity.


ie. improvement of the cone, and Lipschitz norm. The proof of this type of results uses several
geometric facts and observations, that we shall now line up here. The observation we can make
are the following.

Observation 1: (Regular solutions). The first observation is that u,(x) = SUPz eB, (x) u(&) is a viscosity
sub-solution. For De = UyepB,(x), 9D¢, is a parallel surface to 0D and D, has a touching inner ball
at every boundary point. It is also apparent that each boundary point z € dD; realizes its distance
to dD by touching ball from outside of D to dD at some point yz, i.e. there exists B,(z) € D°, with
dist(z, D) = |z — yz| =r. Hence by sub-solution property for u, we have |Vu| 21 in B,(yz). This
in particular implies |Vu,| Z 1 in B,(2), i.e. ite is a (almost) sub-solution. This is usually called a
Regular sub-solution.

Observation 2: (Cone of monotonicity). The Lipschitz property can be replaced by directional
monotonicity for u. More exactly, if K(@,e,) is the optimal (open) cone of directions inside D,
