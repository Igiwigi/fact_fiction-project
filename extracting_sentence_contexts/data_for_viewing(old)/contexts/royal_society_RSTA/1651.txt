larger FOVs, compared to those of ALMA, and are extended to much larger geometric heights
(i.e. up to +14 Mm), though we are primarily interested in the field topology within the ALMA’s
FOVs and up to the geometric heights corresponding to the mid-to-high chromosphere (i.e. 1500-
2500 km). The larger extents reduce possible effects of the sides and top boundaries.


We note that due to uncertainty in the exact heights of formation of the ALMA observations,
the comparison of the magnetic topology of the mid-to-high chromosphere and the oscillatory
behaviours in the ALMA datasets are performed qualitatively. In addition, due to the fact that the
magnetic configuration in the high chromosphere is largely affected by the inclined/horizontal
fields from neighbouring field concentrations /active regions, no quantitative separations in each
dataset between, e.g. network and internetwork regions, are provided.

In the following, we present each dataset, along with their oscillatory and magnetic-topology
properties, in separate figures (i.e. in figures 1-10). Each figure consists six panels organized as,

— Upper left: a brightness temperature map (sampled by the ALMA Band 3 or Band 6) of
each dataset, as noted in the figure’s caption. In the lower-left corner of each brightness-
temperature map, the shape and angle of ALMA’s (synthesized) beam has been depicted.
The beam is a representative of point spread function of the interferometric array, ie. an
elliptical Gaussian whose size and orientation angle depend on the maximum baseline
