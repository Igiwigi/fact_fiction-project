The resulting
gestalt odour, common to all colony members, facilitates
recognition of non-nest-mates but reduces the potential for
within-nest kin recognition [29]. This constraint could mean
that foundresses are unable to detect when they are unrelated
to the dominant, and so cannot adjust their behaviour adap-
tively. However, less closely related pairs of P. dominula
cofoundresses do in fact have less similar hydrocarbon profiles,
suggesting that hydrocarbon cues contain useful information
even within colonies [25,30]. But relatedness itself is a better pre-
dictor of behaviour than hydrocarbon differences [25]. This
suggests either that wasps do not use hydrocarbon cues, or
that specific components, rather than the overall hydrocarbon
profile that has been measured to date, are the cues involved
in recognition [31].
