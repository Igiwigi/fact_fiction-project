The relation between the proportions of chlorine which were evolved at the differ-
ent periods, were as 8'11, 863, and 16:99. I do not attach much importance to the
two first being 80 nearly equal, but to the fact that the quantity which was not ex-
pelled by the heat was sensibly equal to half the total quantity in the salt. B. 58'919 grains of dried protochloride were heated in a porcelain crucible to full
redness, until it fused without any disengagement of gas. The residual subchloride
weighed 47-782 grains, or 8113 per cent.
