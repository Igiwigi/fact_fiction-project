v-At=0, V-ci=0, VxAt=-C’ and VxCl=Ar. (2.21)
Similarly for various derivatives of the electric and magnetic fields; for example,
V-G=0, V-M=0, VxG=-M and VxM=G, (2.22)

with G=E=V x B and M=B=~—V x E, say. It follows immediately that each of the angular
momenta described above has an infinite number of higher and lower extensions [45,47], as do
other quantities, including energy and linear momentum. If we consider the helicity, for example,


and replace, superficially, the fields with their time derivatives, we obtain
Z00 =| 5(Ae .B-C'-Bav. (2.23)

This is the 00-zilch [48,60,80], which was discovered before the helicity, in fact, and takes on a
value equivalent to -thw* per photon, with the w* here deriving from the product of two time
derivatives. That the 00-zilch is conserved follows from the Maxwell-like equations (2.22) in
the same way that the conservation of helicity follows from Maxwell’s equations themselves
(2.20) [45,47]. The 00-zilch is not an angular momentum. Its conservation is associated with a
symmetry which in infinitesimal form is [45,52,81]

ESE+¢°BRB and B>B- cE. (2.24)

This resembles a duality rotation, but differs crucially via the appearance of the second-order
derivatives and fails to qualify as a rotation, in as much as ¢ does not have the dimensions of an
angle. Indeed, 2" itself does not have the dimensions of an angular momentum. Looking at the
integrand of the 00-zilch, we identify
