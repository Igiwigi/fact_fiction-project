When due allowance has been made for the shortness of the period of observation,
and for the influence of disturbing action, we find in this tabular view a much more
conclusive indication of the existence of annual variation than we might perhaps have
been prepared to expect. The inclination is obviously highest in the winter months
and lowest in the summer months, passing through its mean value about the period
of the equinoxes. The horizontal force has a corresponding variation, but with
opposite 8igns. The occasional irregularities are more marked in the horizontal
force than in the inclination, and in both they prevail chiefly in the months of spring
and autumn, It must remain for a separate discussion, to deduce from the great mass
of facts which have now been collected at Toronto, the numerical conclusions which
they will afford in regard to the frequency and magnitude of the disturbances in the
different months of the year; but antecedently to the certain conclusions to be drawn
from such numerical values, it is not an improbable supposition, that the months of
spring and autumn (and notably those of autumn) may prove to be generally the
most disturbed months, and consequently those of the greatest depression of the
horizontal force resulting from the disturbances. The irregularities may be expected
to diminish as the series is extended ; but if they are, in part at least, occasioned by
actual irregularities in the force itself produced by the disturbances, they may bave
a character of permanency in certain months which no continuation of the series
would remove, if it should prove that the disturbances prevail more in some months
than in others, and if their action has on the average a special tendency.
