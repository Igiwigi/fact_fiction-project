THE SOURCES OF THE NITROGEN OF VEGETATION, ETC. 527

ce to Table XII. will show the numerical results of this experiment with
in 1857. g
e beans and peas of 1858, the particulars of which are also given in Table XTI.,
| grow 80 atisfactorily as the beans of 1857, last noticed. Yet the beans of
gave more than three times as much organic matter in the produce as was con-
in the seed, and they appropriated even a much larger proportion of the Nitrogen
of the seed than did those of 1857. The result with the' peas was not s0 satisfactory,
owing to the less healthy character and the more limited amount of their growth.
From the fact that these Leguminous plants did not go through a complete course of
h to the flowering process, it may be objected that hence they did not pass certain
5 ub of growth in which they might possibly assimilate free Nitrogen. We shall refer
Ato this objection again further on. At present we confine attention to the important,
Zfuct, that active growth has taken placeâ€”that the process of cell-formation, with the
S accompanying one of the decomposition of carbonic acid and the fixation of carbon, has
=gone forward with a deficient supply of combined Nitrogen, and in the immediate pre-
ence of free Nitrogen, and yet none of it has been assimilated. 'The plants have in fact
Sheen subjected to a considerable range of the conditions which were considered, & priori,
Sto be fayourable to the assimilation of free Nitrogen ; and yet this has not taken place.
S It is a fact observed in agriculture, that manures rich in organic matter frequently
| Eavour the growth of Leguminous crops. We shall not here discuss the question
Swhether these organic manures, as such, act simply as a source of carbonic acid, or of
