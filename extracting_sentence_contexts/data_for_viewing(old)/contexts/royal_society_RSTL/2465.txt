the mass remote from it. This is probably the rationale of
the restoration of virtue which takes place when a cut disc is
soldered up. And it is not difficult to conceive that a weak
magnetism may be thus very faithfully transmitted through
substances, such as bismuth and lead, whose direct action is
very small, because, as we have seen, the intensity of their
direct action depends, for one of its causes, on the retentive

power of the substance, which is out of question in the indi»
rect mode of action here considered. In fact, if the retentive
power of the solder were reduced to nothing, i, e. if it gained
and lost magnetism instantaneously, it would still act as a
conductor, and probably the better for this quality ; 80 that
the communication between opposite sides of a slit, or conti-
guous portions of two adjacent particles of a powder, would
still be kept up by it, provided it were susceptible of mag-
netism at all, The observed and very striking fact then of
the powerful action of bismuth as a conductor, while its ac-
tion as a magnet is 80 extremely feeble, is in itself a strong
argument for the independence of these two qualities, which
we have designated by the expressions—susceptibility, and
retentive power, and may possibly be made the foundation of
