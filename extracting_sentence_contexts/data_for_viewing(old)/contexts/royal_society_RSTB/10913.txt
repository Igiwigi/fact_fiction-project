http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2016.0321 I examine these relationships in non-human primates. Because most existing
theoretical models of the evolution of sex roles focus on the evolutionary ori-
gins of sex-biased behaviour, they offer only a general scaffold for predicting
variation in sex roles among and within species. I argue that studies examining
sex role variation at these more specific levels need to take social organization
One contribution of 16 to a theme issue â€˜Adult into account to identify meaningful levels for the measurement of ASR and
sex ratios and reproductive strategies: a critical to account for the fact that ASR and sex roles mutually influence each other.
Moreover, taxon-specific life-history traits can constrain sex role flexibility
and impact the operational sex ratio (OSR) by specifying the minimum
length of female time outs from reproduction. Using examples from the pri-
mate literature, I highlight practical problems in estimating ASR and OSR.
Subject Areas: I then argue that interspecific variation in the occurrence of indirect forms of
behaviour, ecology, evolution paternal care might indeed be linked to variation in ASR. Some studies also

indicate that female aggression and bonding, as well as components of inter-

sexual relationships, are sensitive to variation in ASR. Thus, links between
