S,

Read July 8, 181g. Ir has very long appeared to me, that when the earth is
considered with attention, innumerable circumstances are per-
ceived, which cannot but lead to the belief, that it has once been
in a state of general conflagration. The existence in the
skies of planetary bodies, which seem to be actually burning,
and the appearances of original fire discernible on our globe,
I have conceived to be mutually corroborative of each other;
and at the time when no answers could be given to the most
essential objections to the hypothesis, the mass of facts in
favour of it fully justified, I thought, the inference that our
habitation is an extinct comet or sun. The mighty difficulties which formerly assailed this opinion,
great modern discoveries have dissipated. Acquainted now,
that the bases of alkalies and earths are metals, eminently
oxydable, we are no longer embarrassed either for the pabu-
lum of the inflammation, or to account for the products of it.
