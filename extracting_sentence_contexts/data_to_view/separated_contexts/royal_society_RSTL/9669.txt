On the other hand, in two large Stigmarian exogenous cylinders



OF THE FOSSIL PLANTS OF THE COAL-MEASURES. 293

in my cabinet, each of which has a diameter of fully an inch and a half, I found each
of the numerous root-bundles consisting of an average of about forty vessels. These
facts show that as the diameter of the exogenously developed root increases with
age, this growth is accompanied by a corresponding increase both in the dimensions
of each rootleb and in the number and magnitude of the vessels constituting its vascular
| bundle. Fig. 17 represents the inner cylinder, c, with the vascular bundle, a, of a rootlet of
| the same size as fig. 16, but enlarged 270 diameters.
