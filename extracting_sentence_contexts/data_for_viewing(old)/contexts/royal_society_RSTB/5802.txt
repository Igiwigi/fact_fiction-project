point was experimentally tested, it was really only an assumption that the positions
of the new primordia are actually determined by the positions of these gaps. The
present experiments show that they are so determined, and consequently the probability
of his theory is greatly increased. His theory is, however, worked out only for plants
in which the primordia may be considered to be circular in outline, and consequently
it needs to be further considered to what extent it will hold good for plants such as the
Lupin, in which, on accouut of the stipules, the outline of the primordia is certainly not
circular. Moreover, even with regard to plants with circular primordia, there remains


38 M. SNOW AND R. SNOW: EXPERIMENTS ON PHYLLOTAXIS.

at least one group of facts of which Van Irerson has not been able to offer any con-
vineing explanation (1907, p. 247 seq). But since it is intended presently to report
further experiments on phyllotaxis, discussion of these questions will be postponed.

Here, however, it will just be pointed out that Van Irerson’s theory suffices to
render intelligible the origin of Fibonacci phyllotaxis systems in seedlings. For he has
found that in seedlings of numerous species of plants possessing Fibonacci phyllotaxis,
the first two primordia after the cotyledons arise at nearly 180° from one another, and
the divergence angles of the subsequent primordia do not approximate to the normal
Fibonacci angle of 137°-5 until several primordia have arisen. We have found that
this is true for Lupin seedlings also, and the process can be interpreted as a gradual
approach to the angle which is to be expected on Van IrERson’s theory, when the ratio
of the size of a primordium to the size of the apex has sufficiently diminished. In the
