is undoubtedly in the higher as in the lower animals an inherent reproductive
rhythm. ‘Thus, in the dog, at any rate under a state of domestication, the male is
capable of breeding at any time of the year, but the female experiences a regular
sexual cycle, typically of six months’ duration, and which appears to occur inde-
pendently of any exteroceptive or other external stimuli.* On the other hand, in
the nearly related fox, as described by Rowtanps and Parkes (1936), there is a
single annual oestrous cycle, reproduction taking place in the early part of the year.

Tue Gonaps

Before passing on to the consideration of the stimuli which probably act through
the intermediation of the nervous system—and this I propose to do in some detail—
it is desirable to state briefly the main known facts concerning the part played by the
internal organs in regulating sexual and reproductive rhythm. That the gonads
are essential organs in these periodic processes has presumably been recognized ever
since castration was first practised. Thus, it is well known that if these organs are
removed prior to maturity the sexual cycle never begins, or if this is done after maturity
has been reached the cycle stops. Moreover, the gonads in many animals undergo
an increase in size at the approach of breeding, and in some, as in most birds and in
insectivores amongst mammals, this increase is enormous. In rodents it is often accom-
panied in the male by the passage of the testes into the scrotum from which they are
withdrawn after the sexual season is over. ‘The periodic increase in the size of the
accessory sexual organs (prostate, vesiculae seminales, etc.) which, in some mammals
such as the insectivores is very great, is also inhibited by castration, and so is the
annual growth of certain of the secondary sexual characters such as the antlers in
