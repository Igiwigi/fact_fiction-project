*Sulphate of carbyl, when submitted to the action of water, assimilates two equiva-
lents, and is converted into a bibasic acid (ethionie), C,H,4S0, +2 HO=C, H,0,4SO,,
which accordingly may be viewed as an association of alcohol with four equivalents
of anhydrous sulphuric acid, Terms analogous to ethionic acid are sure to be found
when the study of the homologues of sulphate of carbyl shall be taken up by chemists. The production of disulpho-compounds of perfectly similar composition, from
substances belonging to such different groups of bodies as the hydrocarbons, homolo-
gous and analogous to marsh-gas, as ethylene, and as alcohol, suggested the possibility
that the substances observed might be but individual examples of a far more general
mode of formation. It became, in fact, probable that all organic bodies, capable of
uniting with the elements of two equivalents of anhydrous sulphuric acid, might,
under favourable circumstances, be induced to assimilate two additional equivalents
of anhydrous sulphuric acid, and thus furnish terms belonging to the class of disul-
pho- compounds. The hope of arriving at a more general interpretation of our observations induced
us to institute some further inquiries, the result of which we will briefly append. The first question which naturally suggested itself, was the examination of the
deportment of the sulpho-acids derived from acetic, propionic, butyric, benzoic acid,
&c., under the influence of an excess of sulphuric acid.
