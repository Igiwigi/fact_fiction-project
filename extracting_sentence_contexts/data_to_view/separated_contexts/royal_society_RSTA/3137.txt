This is natural because a
classical theory need not be a priori a statistical one: probability is not intrinsic to classical theories,
itis input from the outside. We shall see that the situation with a quantum theory is quite different.

(b) Quantum probability and local commutativity

The crucial difference between a classical and a quantum context is made by the Heisenberg
indeterminacy principle which is a genuine physical principle that cannot be read off only from
the knowledge of the transition probabilities. In fact it can be proved that transition probabilities
among incompatible observables may, in some cases, admit a Kolmogorov model (see [21]). We
will take this principle as the basic axiom which distinguishes classical from quantum probability. According to the general formulation proposed in ยง1d, the information-theoretical essence of this
principle consists in the existence of incompatible observables.
