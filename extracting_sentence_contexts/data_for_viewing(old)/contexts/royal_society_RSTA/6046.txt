periodic along the direct basis {a,,a2}, any single unit cell is subject to external boundary forces
that are anti-periodic. Consequently, f! = —f", f? =—f' and f” =f" — ft —f", so that the term
Zo'f vanishes and equation (3.8) becomes

Zolf=

Zo'K(P) Zo @* = —Zo'K(P) A(L). (3.9)

The solution of the linear system (3.9) provides the incremental periodic displacement field q*
internal to the lattice for every given L. As a consequence of the linearity of q(L), the solution
q'(L) is, in turn, a linear function of L.

A few considerations have to be made about the solvability of the system (3.9). In fact, it is easy
to show that the matrix Zo'K(P) Zo is always singular, regardless of the specific lattice structure
under consideration. This is proved by considering a vector q* =t defining a pure rigid-body
translation and observing that K(P) Zo t =0, which, in turn, implies that the dimension of the
nullspace of Zo'K(P) Zo is at least 2, as two linearly independent rigid-body translations exist for
a two-dimensional lattice. Any other deformation mode, possibly contained in ker(Zo'K(P) Zo),
is therefore a zero-energy mode, called ‘floppy mode’ [37,38]. These modes are excluded in the
following analysis to ensure solvability of system (3.9), so that ker(Zg'K(P) Zo) contains only two
rigid-body translations. Floppy modes can always be recovered in limits of vanishing stiffness
and can be eliminated or introduced playing with prestress [39,40].

Having excluded floppy modes and observing that the right-hand side of equation (3.9) is
orthogonal to ker(Zo'K(P) Zo),
