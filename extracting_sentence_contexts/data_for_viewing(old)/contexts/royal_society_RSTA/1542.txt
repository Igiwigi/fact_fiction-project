well and successfully in all nine participants. No adverse effects were noted. No complications or
impairments related to the SIO imaging procedure occurred in the subjects. In addition, radiation
to the cornea remained well below the recommended limits of ISO 15004-2:2007.

This is the first application of SIM on a human eye in vivo. The new device enables
autofluorescent retinal images with high resolution. It could help detect early stages of disease in
retinal pathologies, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), allowing earlier treatment.
The enhanced resolution allows for detailed examination.

SIO imaging provides higher resolution and better contrast than conventional SLO. The lateral
in vivo resolution of the patient’s eye with SIO was estimated to be approximately 15 1m, which
correlates with the size of an RPE cell. It is not surprising that the resolution in the patient’s eye
is significantly worse than the resolution in the artificial eye. This is due to the fact that in the

Figure 2. Proof of principle with an artificial test eye ex vivo. In the reconstructed SIM result (6) the hexagonal structure of RPE
cells appears and single cells can be distinguished. Resolution and contrast are improved compared to the wide-field image
(a). When imaging tissue in the artificial eye, due to the absence of aberrations, the resolution of the reconstructed image was
found to be close to the theoretical limit for SIM. Experimentally, an analysis of the frequency spectrum of the reconstructed
image showed a resolution of 1.6 jum. See [12].
