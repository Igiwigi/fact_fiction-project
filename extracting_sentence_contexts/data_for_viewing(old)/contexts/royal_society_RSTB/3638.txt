stain for general purposes, but not for the sharp differentiation of the neurofibrill
in the giant elements.

Attention was next given to the method of Brrae (1900) for the differentiation
of neurofibrille, and specimens were preserved in 3-per-cent. nitrie acid, and
subsequently treated with ammoniated alcohol, acid alcohol, and ammonium
molybdate. They were then imbedded and cut into sections, which were
differentiated (as regards their contained ammonium molybdate), and stained on the
slide with toluidin blue. In spite of much care and time expended upon these
operations the results were not satisfactory. The modification of this method
suggested by Prentiss (1903) was then tried. Material fixed in sublimate was
sectioned, and the sections molybdenated on the slide, differentiated, and stained
with toluidin blue. This method yielded better results ; in fact, the preparations so
made showed the neurofibrille in some of the giant fibres, but they were much less

satisfactory in regard to the fibrillee in the giant cells. It then occurred to me that
possibly the material fixed and treated by Berurâ€™s method, in which, therefore,
the affinity for stains of the cytoplasmic granules had been suppressed, might afford
a better chance of obtaining differentiation of the neurofibrille on staining with
iron-hematoxylin, and such proved to be the case. Preparations of this kind were
then made in considerable number and very carefully differentiated, and they yielded
the first clear views of the neurofibrille in the giant cells. In these preparations
