Early concerns on possible deviations from Arrhenius behaviour because of quantum :3
mechanical tunnelling (swb-Arrhenius behaviour) were circumvented ad hoc, e.g. by a : 3

multiplicative transmission coefficient x evaluated according to recipes, such as those due to
Eckart [106], Pelzer & Wigner [3] and Bell [107]. The tunnelling correction Â« is introduced in
