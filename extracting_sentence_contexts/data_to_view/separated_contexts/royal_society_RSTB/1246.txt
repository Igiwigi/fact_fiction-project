The cells marked (x) in fig. 74 are believed to he
added on to the archesporium ; this is, however, unusual. J

The further development proceeds in essential points as in ZL. clavatum, a
would hardly have been necessary to illustrate it by fig. 75, had it not been # a
vascular bundle showed, in the one case figured, a slight extension upwards
the sporangium. I do not, wish to make more of this than the facts warrant,
drawing is a faithful representation of what was seen in this exceptional case,
a matter for remark that these sporangia of Lycopodium, though they are of
siderable size, have no vascular supply; in the whole genus this one case is th
trace I have seen of any extension of the vascular system in the direction :

sporangium. . Tangential sections show that the number of archesporial cells is large;
fig. 76, which is at a phase of development intermediate between those of figs, 62
64 of L. clavatum, shows very beautifully that the number of these is twelve, â€”
limit of the sub-archesporial pad often becomes irregular as the develop
proceeds ; even in an early condition (fig. 76) it is far from being a straight lir
it becomes more irregular with age (fig. 77), the cells of this sterile tissue for
their way upwards into the sporogenous tissue, and occasionally forming multie
processes. The development of it, however, is not carried to so great an extent as
been already noted in L. clavatum. :

Beyond the facts now described, the structure of the sporangium of L, alj
ealls for no further remark; it is obviously similar, in its main aspects, to
L. clavatum, notwithstanding the rather marked difference of external appe
the two species.
