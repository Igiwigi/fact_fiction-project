Bones discovered in a cave at Kirkdale, in Yorkshire. 175

ascertained: into this question (which is one of considerable
difficulty in geology) it is foreign to my present purpose to
enquire, any farther than to state that they were neither pro-
duced, enlarged, or diminished by the presence of the animals
whose bones we now find in them.

The abundance of such caverns in the lime-stone of the
vicinity of Kirkdale, is evident from the fact of the engulf-
ment of several of the rivers above enumerated in the course
of their passage across it from the eastern moorlands to the
vale of Pickering; and it is important to observe, that the
elevation of the Kirkdale cave, above the bed of the Hodge
Beck, exceeding 100 feet, excludes the possibility of our
attributing the muddy sediment we shall find it to contain,
to any land flood or extraordinary rise of the waters of that
or any other now existing river.

It was not till the summer of 1821, that the existence of
any animal remains, or of the cavern containing them, had
been $uspected. At this time, in continuirig the operations of
