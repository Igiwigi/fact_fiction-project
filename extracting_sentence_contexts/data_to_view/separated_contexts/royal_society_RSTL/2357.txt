If: heat be, comparatively with the
quantity of light which the plant receives, excessive, male flowers only appear ;
but if light be in excess, female flowers alone will be produced :—the experi-
ments necessary must of course be-made with skill and accuracy. In a former communication to the Royal Society © Upon the comparative

RELATING TO THE ECONOMY OF BEES. 323

I have inferred, from facts there stated, that the sex of the offspring of some
species of animals is given by the female parent. Subsequent experience and
observation have strengthened my þelief in the truth of this inference : but I
believe the power of the female parent to be rather strongly influential than
positive, and that external causes operate, which (I have some reason to sus-
pect) are not in all cases wholly beyond the reach of human controul. Tromas Anprew KNIGHT.
