Bodies placed behind it were scen undimmed through the
cloud. 'The flame of a candle suffered no sensible diminution of its light. It was easy
to read through the cloud a page which the cloud itself illuminated. In fact the cloud
was a comet's tail on a s8mall scale. It proved that matter of almost infinite tenuity is
competent to shed forth light of similar quality, and in far greater quantity than that
discharged by the tails of comets *.
'These facts render the statement intelligible that even when all reasonable precautions
appear to have been taken it is not easy to escape every trace of chemical action on
firss charging the experimental tube even with an inert substance. In my earlier
experiments, when distilled water only was employed to cleanse the tube, the first
experiment with air alone was sure to develope an actinic cloud of a beautiful fern-
leaf pattern.
