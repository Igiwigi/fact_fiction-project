DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL IN THE MAMMALIA. 55

for articulation with the incus, and in the tendon of origin of the stapedius muscle
(s:.m.) there is a round © interhyal” (infrastapedial) nucleus of cartilage (7.ky.).

Besides the superficial dentary bone (d.), with its splenial aud coronoid tract, there
is only one other os8eous centre shown in this figure ; that is the first rudiment of
the malleus (ml.)—as a bone—and it is the homologue of the * articulare externum ”
of the Ovipara.

Skull of an embryo of Bradypus (Arctopithecus) ? 8p. (5 inches long).—Second Stage.

We must in these comparisons keep in view the fact that we are dealing with
modifications of growth in the individual, and also with specific, and even generic
differences ; these latter are not very great, and can easily be allowed for.

This skull of an embryo, almost twice as advanced as the last, looks more embryonic
than it, for the face is shorter, and the cranium s8wells up above, giving ib an almost
Simian character (Plate 8, figs. 5 and 6).

The lower view (Plate 8, fig. 5) is curiously like, and yet in several things unlike,
that of the earlier embryo of the Unau (Plate 8, fig. 1). The nostrils and alinasal
region (e.n., al.n.) are quite similar in both, but behind them the premaxillaries (pz.)
are smaller, but bave longer palatine processes. The anterior palatine foramina,
exposing the openings of JAcoBs0N's organs (/.0.), are better enclosed as two lanceo-
