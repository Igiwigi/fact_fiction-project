In the current context with a source at a large height, a major part of the valley would
be artificially put in an acoustic shadow zone (figure 1b), leading to inaccurate results. Although
applying a higher-order source approximation could extend the cone with correct predictions [17],
at the source side of the valley this problem would still remain. The solution to this problem is found in the fact that the GFPE method is able to commence
from any vertical array of pressures that can be accurately calculated at sub-wavelength spacing. There are actually three possibilities. Most commonly used is a Gaussian starter [17] as the
first column of pressures, representing a monopole source.
