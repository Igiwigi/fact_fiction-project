Besides the possibility of direct injury to other p

for more than one operation on the cerebellum was performed on the same animal,
perchloride of mercury lotion was used in the plugs inserted to stop hemorrhs
from the cerebellum. This latter procedure alone gives rise to diffuse changes whic
vitiate such experiments. In further support of this surmise that the degenerationsi
question may be accidental is the fact that, as we shall have reason to point out sho
other observers have produced these additional degenerations by purposely injurin
parts contiguous to the cerebellum, and I have myself obtained some of them b
accidental injury to such parts. With regard to the degenerations met with in the cerebellar peduncles, my oy
results are in accord with those of Marcut and of Ferrter and TURNER, in so far
the middle and inferior peduncles are concerned, for I only found degenerated fibi
in these peduncles on the side of the lesion, while no sign of any degenerated fib
could be detected in the middle and inferior peduncles of the opposite side. But witl
regard to the superior peduncles, I am compelled to join issue with these observer
for degenerated fibres are certainly to be seen in this structure on both sides afte
simple ablation of one lateral lobe of the cerebellum, The degenerated fibres occupy
so special a position in the superior peduncle of the opposite side (see fig. 7), that it i
strongly opposed to the result being an accidental one.
