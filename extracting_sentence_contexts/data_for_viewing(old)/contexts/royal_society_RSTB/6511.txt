A more unexpected result was produced by the resting spores kept in the ice-box
where on the 6th day six and on the 9th day a further two vegetative cells were found.
This fact shows that resting spores, provided they are placed in fresh culture medium,
are capable of germination at a comparatively low temperature and in almost
uninterrupted darkness (they were exposed to light for short periods during the daily
examinations). Therefore the quality of the medium seems to be the most important
factor for germination. This conclusion is supported by the behaviour of the other
1000 resting spores kept at room temperature where germination took place during

a period when in other cultures with an older culture medium, but not necessarily
with a larger number of cells than 1000 per c.c. of fluid, very many resting spores
were formed under otherwise similar conditions.
