millions of people based on the particular characteristics

For an individual researcher designing a new study involving
synaesthetes, I believe the best practice will be to make choices,
not assumptions. That is to say, it is not the case that obtaining a
single colour for each word, or any of the other assumptions I
have addressed above, is always inappropriate. Rather, each
researcher should consider their options carefully and choose
how many colours to obtain, or what other qualities or ratings
to ask for from synaesthetes, without dismissing any of these
options out of hand. On the other side of this coin, it can be
very difficult to know what data may, in fact, be useful to collect,
and what may be superfluous, since not enough is currently
known about the overall nature of synaesthetic experiences to
make this determination from the outset based on the literature.
