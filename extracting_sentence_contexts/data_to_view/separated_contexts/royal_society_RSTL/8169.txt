Received November 27, 1873,—Read February 5, 1874. S Armnoven the method of measuring the varying intensity of the chemically active rays,
A as affecting chloride-of-silyer paper of constant sensitiveness described in the Bakerian
S Lecture for 1865, has been the means of pointing out many important facts * concern-
Sy ing the distribution of the sun's chemical activity through the atmosphere as well as
= in different situations on the earth's surface, it has not as yet been introduced as a
J regular portion of the work of meteorological observatories. Until this.is done, and
© the measurements are regularly continued and made in many situations, we cannot
= hope to obtain any thing like a knowledge of the laws of distribution of these rays
over the earth's surface, or any information as to the yearly variation of the s0lar
Z chemical activity. This non-adoption of the method has to be explained, not in any
= want of reliance in the process or in the results, but in the fact that, in order to obtain
'Z a atisfactory curve of daily chemical intensity, at least hourly observations need to be
\2 made; this involves, however, the expenditure of s0.
