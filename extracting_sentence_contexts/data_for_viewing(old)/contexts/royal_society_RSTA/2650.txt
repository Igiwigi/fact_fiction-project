at 45° inclination. The wettability includes superhydrophobic, hydrophobic, hydrophilic (uncoated) and superhydrophilic 3
surfaces, and a beetle-inspired surface (which includes 0.5 mm diameter circular superhydrophilic spots surrounded by a 3

and superhydrophilic. This is attributed to the fact that the higher the repellency, the more
spherical the droplet shape will be, which results in a lower contact area between the droplet
and the surface. Therefore, less heat will be transferred to the droplet and less evaporation will be
observed. Large spherical droplets are formed on the superhydrophobic surface which roll down.
In the case of hydrophilic and superhydrophilic surfaces, the droplets spread across the surface
leading to higher evaporation [58].

A beetle-inspired surface was found to collect more water than flat surfaces with various
homogeneous wettability. In a beetle-inspired surface, because of the heterogeneity, droplets can
slide/roll at a faster rate, and maintain a spherical droplet shape. The faster rate also leads to less
evaporation [58].

Gurera & Bhushan [58] also performed experiments on various surfaces at 0° inclination
