formed from the resinous and other vegetable substances by
any of the known chemical processes, yet there is every
reason to believe, that the agent employed by nature in the
formation of coal and bitumen has been either muriatic or
sulphuric acid ; and when it is considered, that common salt
is never found in coal mines except when in the vicinity of
salt springs, whilst on the contrary, pyrites, sulphate of iron,
and alum, most commonly are present;* these facts, together
with the suIphureous odour emitted by most of the mineral
coals when burned, appear strongly to eyince the agency of
the latter. That this has been the case, seems also to be
corroborated, by the great resemblance which (as has been
previously stated) the coals formed artificially from many
vegetable substances bear to the mineral coals, especially as
the similarity is not confined to external characters, but extends
to other properties.

By the action of sulphuric acid on vegetable bodies, a much
greater portion of their carbon is converted into coal than
when the same are subjected to the effects of fire.
