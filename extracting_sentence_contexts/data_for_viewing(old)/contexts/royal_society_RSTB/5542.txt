the tritocerebral or premandibular appendages are found (fig. 7). These are so short-
lived that they can only be found in embryos of an age at which antennal rudiments are
first forming. They are median and posterior in position to the antennw and lie
immediately behind the shallow invagination of the future mouth.

The next three pairs of appendages, mandibles, maxille and labium have a typical
development, and reference need only be made to the fact that they occupy the vertically
curved part of the head, the mandibles having a dorsal and the labium a ventral position
in the egg (fig. 2). A transverse section through this region therefore passes through
all three segments (fig. 50). If one examines embryos of the stage shown in fig. 2 (at
this stage premandibular appendages have disappeared) two distinct sets of structures
are seen in front of the mouth. Projecting forwards and occupying the median groove
which separates the protocerebral lobes from one another is a pair of prominent lobes»
whose bases meet in the middle line and are continuous laterally with the protocerebral
lobes of the future brain. Their bases are separated by a distance of some 30p from

the mouth. The latter is further overhung on its anterior side by a median unpaired
lobe, quite distinct from the above-mentioned structures. Fig. 51 is a drawing of a
transverse section through the procephalic lobes, with the pair of median appendages
