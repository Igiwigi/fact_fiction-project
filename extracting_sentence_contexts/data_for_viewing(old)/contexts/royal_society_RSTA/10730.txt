theoretical curves, partly by reading ordinates where the contour of the curves was
nearly straight, and partly by quadrature near the tails. Till tables have been
calculated for the skew curves, such processes are all that are available ; but they
are quite sufficient, for we do not want great exactness in the determination of ?.
We merely desire to know whether the observations are with reasonable probability
the result of a random sampling from the proposed theoretical distribution, Now
let us examine the results. We see that for (2), (83-2), and (2-1) the normal curve is
for practical purposes “ impossible.” As a matter of fact, we might have gone to the
tenth figure without the probability being sensible in these cases. Further, (1) is
highly improbable, the odds being about 1666 to 1 against its occurrence as a
random sample. In the case of (1-3) the odds are 22 to 1 against a deviation as
bad or worse than this, so that this is an improbable result. Lastly in case 3, and
this only, we find the odds short, only 2°4 to 1, about, against it; a case such
as this would occur on the average about twice in five trials. It is really the only
case in which, under our present test, we could admit the normal curve.

Turning to the skew curve, we see that in three out of the six cases the odds are in
its favour, namely, in (1), (3), and (1-3). Tt is not improbable in (2), the odds being
only about 5 to Lagainst it. Itisimprobable in (2-1) and very improbable in (3-2) ; in
both of these cases, however, it is at least a million times as probable as the normal
