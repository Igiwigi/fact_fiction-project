Zhang et al. discuss the crack propagation along the twist boundary of nano-nickel bi-crystal [20]. Elzas and Thijsse propose a cohesive law for crack growth along Fe/precipitate interfaces [21]. In
fact, spontaneous cracking along the bi-metal interface cannot be expected since the rupture occurs
in either side of lower surface energy and elastic constants, as reported in our previous study on
adhesion of Ni/Al interface [22]. However, some impurities such as oxide and precipitate could
initiate cracking along interfaces. Thus we introduce an ideal crack along the bi-metal interface by
virtual force shield.
