The rate of occurrence of both types is greater by night than by day, but their dispersion
is more or less independent of time of day. Long whistlers occur more frequently in summer
than in winter, while the reverse is true for short whistlers. The day-to-day variations of total
whistler activity exhibit a small but definite positive correlation with magnetic disturbance
The variations of the dispersion correlate with those of the critical frequency of the /, layer.

PART 2. A THEORY OF WHISTLING ATMOSPHERICS
10. PRELIMINARY REMARKS
The main facts of observation concerning the whistling atmospherics have been described
in the first part of this paper, and are summarized above in its final paragraph. We have
now to consider the problem of their origin.

Previously a theory of whistlers had been developed by Eckersley (1935) following a
suggestion of Barkhausen (1930). This theory was chiefly based on the observation of
whistlers following impulsive atmospherics, and proposed that the whistlers were produced
from the atmospherics by dispersion. Eckersley showed that at frequencies below the gyro-
frequency radio waves could be propagated freely through the ionosphere in the extra-
ordinary mode (provided that the Lorentz term in the equations of propagation was zero),
and that at audible frequencies the group velocity of the waves increased rapidly with
increasing frequency, so that over a long path the different frequency components ofa pulse
y predicted that the
