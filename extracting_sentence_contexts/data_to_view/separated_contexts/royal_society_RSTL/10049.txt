Anteriorly the canal becomes
Sgradually smaller and smaller in correlation with the reduced size of the ovarian ridge,
'Zand ends blindly nearly on a level with the front end of the excretory organs. HD It should be noted. that, owing to the mode of formation of the ovarian ac, the
Souter 8ide of the ovary with the band of thickened germinal epithelium is turned
'Howards the lumen of the ac ; and thus the fact of the ova being formed on the
inner wall of the genital sac in the adult is explained, and the comparison which we
=Zinstituted in our description of the adult between the inner wall of the genital sac
d the free genital ridge of Elasmobranchs receives its justification. 'S It is farther to be noticed that, from the mode of formation of the ovarian sac, the
openings of the peritoneal funmels of the excretory organs ought to open into its
lumen ; and if these openings persist in the adult, they will no doubt be found in
this 8itnation.
