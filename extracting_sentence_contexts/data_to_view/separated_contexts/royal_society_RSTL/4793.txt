As it is universally admitted that the glacier proper does not grow in thick-
ness by snowy accumulations, the important variations in its level in different years+
cannot be ascribed to the severity of certain seasons increasing the mass of snow
falling upon it, but rather to the prolongation of the winter cold into spring and
summer, which causes the condensing or accumulating process to be in excess, and
therefore the thickness of the plastic mass to accumulate beyond its due amount. Thus we have the following phenomena, all independently observed, reconciled
and explained by one hypothesis; the general convexity of the crevasses upwards,
notwithstanding the excess of motion in the centre; the general verticality of the
crevasses, notwithstanding the retardation of the bottom ; the perfect state of the
crevasses every spring succeeding their visible collapse in autumn; the ascertained
velocity of different parts of the glacier, and the diversity of the annual changes which
these velocities present ; the seemingly opposed facts showing the glacier to be sub-
Jected to powerful tension, producing crevasses, and yet to be under a compression
which produces in some places the frontal dip; and finally, the renewal of the level
of the ice during winter, which has been lost partly by superficial melting, but as
much or more 80 by the attenuation and collapse of the glacier during summer. These various effects of one cause, though they do not embrace all the phenomena of
glaciers, certainly include a very remarkable and complicated group of facts.

+ For instance, it has been seen from Barxar's narrative (p. 189 above), that in 1845 the glacier attained a
much higher level at the Angle than it had done for three previous years at least, since all the marks of mea-
surements which were cut on the rock in 1842 were concealed ; and he attributes this, apparently with reason,
to the extreme lateness and coldness of the spring,


PLASTICITY—VEINED STRUCTURE. 205

Plasticity—Feined Structure.—l certainly never expected, when promulgating the
viscous theory, that it would haye met with s0 much oppoxition on the ground that
the more familiar properties of ice are opposed to the admission of its plasticity ;
and that the fragility of hand specimens should be considered as conclusive against the
plastic effect of most intense forces acting on the most stupendous scale upon a body
placed in cireumstances which subject it to a trial, beneath which the most massive
constructions of the pyramid-building ages would sway, totter, and crumble. In
an age when generalizations of the more obvious kinds are no longer proofs of genins
and perspicacity, and when popular writers on science delight to startle their readers
by showing how bodies the most dissimilar possess properties in common; in an
age in which gradations of properties and organs have been studied with such perse-
vering sagacity, and in which 80 many unexpected qualities have heen discovered ;—
when iron is classed as a combustible, when metals are found which float on water
and which catch fire on touching ice, when a pneumatic vacuum is formed and main-
tained in vessels five miles long, and whose sides are ripped open twenty times a day ;
—when, moreover, the simpler abstractions of former times are being daily overset,
when no body seems to possess any one property in perfection, and all seem to pos-
sess imperfectly every quality admitting of degree ; when adamant is rejected from
our yocabulary, and softness means only less hardness, and the definition of a perfect
fluid is as imaginary as that of a solid without weight ;—when a vacuum and a ple-
num are alike scoffed at, and even the heavenly bodies toil through media more or less
resisting; when no substance is admitted to expand uniformly by heat, when glass
may be considered a conductor of electricity, and metals as imperfect insulators ;—in
these days, when the barriers of the categories are 80 completely beaten down, I had
not, expected to meet with s0 determined an opposition to the proposition that the
stupendous aggregation of freezing water and thawing ice, called a glacier, subjected
to the pressure of thousands of vertical feet of its own substance, might not under
these circumstances possess a degree of yielding, moulding, self-adapting power, suf-
ficient to admit of slight changes of figure in long periods of time, Still less could I
have anticipated that when the plastic changes of form had been measured and com-
pared, and calculated and mapped, and confirmed by independent observers, that we
$hould still have had men of science appealing to the fragility of an icicle as an un-
answerable argument ! More philosophical surely was the appeal of the Bishop of
Annecy from what we already know to what we may one day learn if willing to be
taught: © Quand on agit sur un morceau de glace, qu'on le frappe, on lui trouye une
rigidit6 qui est en opposition directe avec les apparences dont nous venons de parler.
