scepticism in public opinion. What is your view on this? &

the fossil fuels off and have renewables when there aren’t really market
mechanisms to shut the fossil fuels off.

My own view is that it will be very difficult to assume that renewables

global effort around CCS with a number of countries working together
in a pre-competitive phase to demonstrate the technology across a
