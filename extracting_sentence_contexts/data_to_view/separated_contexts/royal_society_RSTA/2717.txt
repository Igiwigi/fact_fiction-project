When a dishevelled Time Traveller
returns from AD 802, 701 and beyond, one of his incredulous friends exclaims ‘What was this
time traveling? A man couldn’t cover himself with dust by rolling in a paradox, could he?’

The best known paradox is almost certainly the grandfather paradox: what if the Time Traveller :
journeys back to when granddad is a baby and kills him—from where then comes the Time [=
Traveller? This is an old paradox, one that generations of science fiction writers have had a lot 5
of fun with, but in fact there is a resolution to it that has found general agreement among most :
physicists and philosophers, a resolution that does not conclude that time travel to the past is Da
impossible [36,40]. There are, however, plenty of other even more bizarre paradoxes that have not :
been so tamed, and I'll concentrate here on just one type, a type that lends itself in a natural way 74
to Heaviside’s FTL particles, as well as to his early life as a telegraph operator. I am referring to 73
the possibility (or not) of creating an information loop in time. : S
