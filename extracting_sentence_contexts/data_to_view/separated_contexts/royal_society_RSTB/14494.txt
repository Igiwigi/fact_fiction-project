Second, recovery from early blindness can cause very
selective visual deficits. As Ione Fine and colleagues’ found
with Mike May when he recovered his sight, his perception
of visual motion was relatively ‘normal’, whilst his percep-
tion of 3D form remained permanently impaired [380,381]. In this issue, Fine & Park explain this by pointing to the
fact that early blind individuals use auditory motion for
many of the tasks we would typically attribute to 3D vision
(e.g. navigating a busy interaction using noise from passing
cars). But how is this possible? Fine & Park [382] find that
this ability relies on the auditory system adopting brain
area hMT+, that's associated with visual motion processing
in normal observers, but it changes the nature of the
motion processing that hMT+ engages in to accommodate
the low spatial resolution of auditory information.
