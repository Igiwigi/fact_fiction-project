By contrast, reproduc-
tive success and the development of the larger human brain
and more robust progeny are dependent on maintenance of
KIR B haplotypes and HLA-C2. In each human population,
the relative frequencies of these haplotypes will be subject
to natural selection depending on pathogen load, reproductive
pressure and of course will change with time [12]. The fact that
all human populations maintain both KIR A and B haplotypes
as well as HLA-C1 and -C2, suggests that populations that lose
one of these components are doomed to extinction when sub-
jected to extreme selection by events such as infection, famine
and warfare. While the factors responsible for the high incidence of
HLA-C2 and the KIR A haplotype in current African popu-
lations are not yet clear, this undoubtedly contributes to the
high frequency of pre-eclampsia, stillbirth and FGR found in
sub-Saharan Africa. It is interesting to note that in such popu-
lations there is also an increased frequency of obstructed
labour [50].
