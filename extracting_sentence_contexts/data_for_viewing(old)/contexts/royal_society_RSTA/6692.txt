converging to some limiting lattice A’, say. Since Q,A is a critical lattice of K, and there is
a point Q, P, of Q,A of the form (a,, 0, a,), where

it follows that A’ is a critical lattice of K and that (1, 0,1) is a point of A’ on the boundary
of K.
By Mordell’s result, stated earlier, the lattice A’ must be of the form} @A,, where @ is
an automorphism of K. Now the lattices @-'Q,A converge to the lattice Ag. As (1, 0,1) is
+ As (1,0, 1) is a point of A’ it is natural to suppose that A’ = Ay or A’ = Aj, where Ay is obtained from

Ag by changing x, into —x,. This is not obvious, but it is in fact true, as we prove on p. 337. The difference
between the statements that every critical lattice of K is of the form @Ag for some automorphism © of K and

that a critical lattice with (1,0, 1) as a lattice point is necessarily either Ay or Ap seems to have escaped
notice. A similar problem arises on p. 333 in connexion with the body | *%2%3 | <1.

a point of Ag, there are points Q, of 0-1Q,A, for r = 1, 2, ..., converging to the point (1, 0, 1).
Consequently there is a sequence of automorphisms @,, 7 = 1, 2,..., converging to the unit
automorphism and transforming the points Q, into points of the form (,,0,,), where 4,
converges to the limit 1. Taking
