Trans. 1857, pp. 703-715), relate to equations of the form (a, 6. . a, y)"=0,
without numerical coefficients ; but it is, I think, desirable to give the corresponding tables
for equations in the form (a, b, . .Xx, y)"=0 with numerical coefficients, which is the
standard form in quantics. The transformation can of course be effected without diffi-
culty, and the results are as here given. It is easy to see @ priors that the sum of the
numerical coefficients in each table ought to vanish ; these suwms do in fact vanish, and
we have thus a verification as well of the tables of the present Addition as of the tables
of the original memoir, by means whereof the present tables were calculated. Table (2, 2). Table (3, 2). -Y
