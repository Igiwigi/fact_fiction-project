The chronograph itself has been described by Sears and Tomlinson (1931). One of
the markers records the seconds signals of one of the N.P.L. quartz crystal clocks
(Essen 1936)—and the other marker records the making and breaking of the contact
of the gravity pendulum with the contact device.

The approximate equality of the make/break and break/make periods was used as
the criterion for the correct symmetrical setting of the contact carried on the rod M.
The setting of the fine adjustment screw was varied until the successive half-periods
were very closely equal, as shown by the chronograph record. When this was achieved,
the two platinum wires forming the contact were just touching when the pendulum
was vertically at rest. A small correction had usually to be applied to the chronograph
reading owing to the fact that it was impossible precisely to equalize the two half-
periods by means of the adjusting screw. This matter will be dealt with more fully in
§ 6, where a typical set of chronograph observations is discussed.

(f) Knife-edges

The knife-edges used throughout these experiments were made of hardened steel.*
The form of the knife-edge is shown in fig. 5. The base, of area 4} x 1 in., was ground
and lapped flat and the two sides were ground perpendicular to the base. The lapped
base provided a satisfactory rigid seating when the knife-edge was screwed down on to
