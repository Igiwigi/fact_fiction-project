Herein, dispersion
and absorption can approximately be neglected, although they are not strictly zero. This means
that the electromagnetic energy can move 33% (or 50%) faster than in this isotropic surrounding
without getting into conflict with relativity. This allows for coordinate transformations that obey
n(r) > 1 everywhere in the cloak and that appreciate the fact that, in the visible range, the
maximum refractive index of known reasonably transparent off-resonant constituent materials
is limited to about 1 = 3. To avoid material anisotropies and to obtain a polarization-independent
behaviour (see above), the possible coordinate transformations must be restricted to conformal
maps (see above). These thoughts combined form the basis for the so-called carpet (or ground-
plane) cloak [2], which makes a curved line (a curved reflecting surface) appear like a straight line
(flat mirror).
