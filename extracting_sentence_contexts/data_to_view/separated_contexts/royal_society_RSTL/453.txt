The stones are:
« of a quality not found in- any part of the Siennese territory ;
« they fell about eighteen» hours after the enormous eruption. of
« Mount Vesuvius; which circumstance leaves a choice of .dif--
« ficulties in the solution of this extraordinary phenomenon.
« Either these stones have been generated in this igneous mass
« of clouds, which: produced such. unusual thunder; or, which is
« equally incredible, they were: thrown from Vesuvius, at a
« distance of at least 250: miles; judge then of its, parabola.
« The- philosophers here incline to the first solution. I wish
« much, Sir, to know your sentiments. My first objection was.
« to the fact itself; but of this there are s0- many eye witnesses,,
« it Seems impossible to withstand their evidence.” (Phil. Trans.
for 1795- p- 10g.). Sir WiLLam Hamiitoy, it seems, also
received a piece of one of the largest stones, which weighed
upwards. of five pounds; and had. seen another, which weighed
about one.
