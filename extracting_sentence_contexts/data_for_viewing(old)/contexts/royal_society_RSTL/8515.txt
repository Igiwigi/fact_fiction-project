observation which we do not meet with in Zydractinia; for while the complete separa-
tion of the sexes on different colonies in /lydractinia will enable us at all times to say,
no matter how young may be the gonophore under examination, whether this be male
or female, in Myriothela we have no certain sign by which to decide as to the sex of
Â© the gonophore in its youngest stages, gonophores of both sexes being here borne on the
8ame blastostyle. It is scarcely possible, however, that among the many cases of
extremely young gonophores which I examined there were not both male and female
examples; and in no case did I find any thing which would lead me to believe that the
origin of the generative elements in one was different from what it was in another.

The facts here noted have thus led me to maintain that both male and female elements
have their origin in the endoderm. Still, considering the difficulty of the observations,
and the fact that the appearances lie possibly open to another interpretation, I do not,
desire to insist on the impossibility of the generative elements being in one or both
8exes Primarily introduced from the ectoderm into the endoderm ; and I am willing to
wait for the confirmation which may be expected from further investigations.

As is well known, all the fixed hydroids pass through a free locomotive stage before
finally attaching themselves. TI have elsewhere* pointed out that this free stage shows
itself under one or other of two forms, namely, that of a planula (as in the great majority of
hydroids, Campanula, Sertularia, Coryne, &c.) and that of an actinula (as in Tubularia).

The free hydroid planula is a closed sac in whose walls an endoderm and an ectoderm are
differentiated, not by a process of invagination, but by one of dilamination, and in which
an oral orifice is afterwards formed by a perforation of its walls, the planula thus
