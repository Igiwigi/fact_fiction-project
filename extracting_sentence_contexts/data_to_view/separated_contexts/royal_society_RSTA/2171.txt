There exist positive constants e9 and K independent of ¢ such that the ‘energy’

This estimate shows that the particle spends a long time in the well of the effective potential W. The above discussion leaves open the question of stability of (2.11) for all time. In fact, forn > 1
such stability is virtually certain to fail due to Arnold diffusion. For the case of n = 1 the proof of
stability for all time depends on the verification of the assumptions of the Kolmogorov—Arnold—
Moser theory. There is a considerable literature by now dealing with such questions, see [18] and
references therein.
