Evidently the chances are
that a considerable contraction in bulk accompanied the process of carbonisation ; but
the matrix about Palseospondylus adheres to it closely, no interspace exists between
the rock and the fossil, either empty or filled with a mineral deposit, the sand-
grains of which the rock chiefly consists are in immediate contact with the fossil. Hence carbonisation may be inferred to have been practically completed before the
rock was consolidated. Taking all the facts into consideration we are inclined to
think that the transformation into coal was not effected very slowly. An important question next arises as to what was the original character of the
skeletal substance of Paleeospondylus. As already pointed out it now consists of coal,
which, so far as can be seen, differs from that of Coccosteus solely by a slightly
greater density, due probably to the presence of a somewhat larger proportion of
mineral salts.
