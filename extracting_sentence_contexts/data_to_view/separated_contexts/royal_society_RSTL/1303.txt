Thus, in ſpeaking
f theair produced upon expoſing raw filk in water to the aftion
Sof light, I ſhall ſometimes mention it as being yielded by the
S6ilk ; and 1 ſhall ſometimes ſpeak of the air furniſhed by ex-
Foſing water, which has previouſly turned green, in the ſun's
rays, as being immediately produced by the water, though it is
Zprobable, that the green matter ads a very important part in
Zthe produQtion of this air in the one- caſe and in the other. But
F- ow it a&tsis not well aſcertained ; and I had in general much
Srather confine myſelf to a ſimple, and even 2a unlearned, de-
S\cription of faCts, than by endeayouring to give more preciſe
Sdefinitions, at firſt, to involve myſelf in all the difficulties
Z'which would attend accounting for phznomena, whoſe cauſes
Z are but very imperfe&tly known. S You will, therefore, not be ſurpriſed, if you ſhould ſome-
2 times find me ſpeaking of appearances in the fame manner as
Za perſon would mention them who ſaw them for the firſt time,
8 and who did not know that others had diſcovered them before,
_ and how they had endeavoured to account for them, I ſhall
take care that the facts ſhall be faithfully deſcribed, and I flat-
ter myſelf you will not think them the leſs intereſting on
account of their being unadorned,—But I baſten to give you

a account of my experiments,

86 Sir Bexjanin Tromeson's Experiments |

c Enperiment N* 1, -

© My firſt obje&t was to colle& a ſufficient quantity of the air
ſeparated from water by fiik to determine its goodneſs by the?
teſt of nitrous air; and to this end, having filled with clear?
ſpring water a globe of thin, white, and very tranſparent
glaſs, 44 inches in diameter, with a cylindrical neck 2 of an
inch in diameter, and about 12 inches long, I introduced into ®:
it 20 grains of raw filk, which bad been previouſly wathed in |
water, in order to free it of air; and inverting the globe under wa-
ter, and placing its neck in a glaſs jar, containing a quantity of
the ſame water with which the globe was filled, 1 expoſed it *'
in my window to the a&tion of the ſun's rays, and prepared |
myſelf to examine the progreſs of the generation or produQtion © {
'of the air,

The globe had not been expoſed ten minutes to the aQtion of :
the ſun's rays, when I diſcovered an infinite number of ex- *
ceedingly ſmall air-bubbles, which began to make their ap=
pearance upon the ſurface of the filk ; and theſe bubbles con- |
tinuing to increaſe in number, and in fize, at the end of about '
two hours the filk, appearing to be intirely covered with them,
roſe to the upper part of the globe. Theſe bubbles going on to increaſe in ſize, and running into
each other, at length began to detach themſelves from the ilk, | }
and to form a colleQion of air at the upper part of the globe; *
but the meaſure of my eudiometer being rather large, it was |
not till after the globe had been expoſed in the ſun near four
days, that a ſufficient quantity of air was colle&ed to make the

experiment with uitrous air, in order to aſcertain its goodneſs by
that teſt,

© Having at length colle&ted a ſufficient quantity of this air
for that purpoſe, I carefully removed it from the globe, and
mixing with 1 meaſure of it 3 meaſures of nitrous air, they were
reduced to 1,24 meaſures; which ſhews, that it was aQtually
dephlogi efficated air, and that of a conſiderable degree of purity,

Common air, tried at the ſame time, 1 meaſure of it with
x meaſure of nitrous air were reduced to 1,08 meaſure,
&+ Having again expoſed the globe with-the ſame water and filk
In my window, where the ſun ſhone the greateſt part of the
Flay, at the end of three days I had colleQed 34 cubic inches
wk air, which, proved with nitrous air, gave 14+ 3u=1,18;
Shat is to ſay, 1 meaſure of this: air, added /o 3 meaſures of
Ditrous air, were reduced to 1,18 meaſure.
9 A ſmall wax taper, which had been juſt blown ou a ſinall
Sart only of the wick remaining red-hot, upon-being, plunged
[a a phial filled with this air, immediately took. fire, and
urnt with a very bright and enlarged flame.
/ The water in the globe appeared to have loſt ſomething of its
Fratpuecy and had changed its colour to. a very faint
eeniſh caſt, having at the ſame time acquired the odour or
egrance proper to raw filk, : q
S This -experiment I repeated ſeveral times with freſh water
{retaining the fame filk) and always. with nearly the fame rg
alt ; with this difference, \however, (that when !the ſun ſhong
Srery bright, the quantity of air produced was not only greater,
Abut its quality likewiſe was-much ſuperior to-that yielded whey
the ſun's rays were more feeble, or when they: were: frequently
intercepted by flying clouds. The air, however, was always
not only-much better than common air, but. better than-the air
in general produced - by the freſh leaves of plants .expaſed in

was ſo good that 1 meaſure of it required 4! meaſures of nitrous |
air to faturate it, and 3,65 meaſures of the two airs were de-

very convenient ; and for that reaſon, I ſhall continue to make
