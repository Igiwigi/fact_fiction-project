or approximately 2 per cent. In human cells, this is
(0.99)?° °° — 6 x 10-719! Thus, to achieve a robust
block to re-replication in each cell cycle, the block to
re-initiation on a per origin basis must be far, far greater
than 99 per cent. To achieve a 99 per cent probability that
no origin will re-fire in a single cell cycle in yeast, the
probability on a per origin basis is “9/0.99 = 0.99998,
or 99.998 per cent efficient. In human cells,
this is ~°”0.99 = 0.9999998. Or, in other words, an
error rate of approximately 1 in 10? initiation events in
yeast and approximately 1 in 10’ in human cells is 6. PERSPECTIVES AND CHALLENGES
required to achieve this 99 per cent probability. Given = The calculations described above are, by necessity,
the fact that even very limited re-replication is lethal in not based on any ‘real’ numbers. For example, what is
yeast [68,72,92], it is highly likely that the overall block the actual rate of re-initiation in wild-type cells in vivo?
to re-initiation in wild-type cells is considerably greater Previous plasmid loss assays in yeast have suggested
than 99 per cent. that the rate of re-initiation per origin is less than 1 in
10°? [96], which was the limit of detection in this
assay. However, as described above, the real number is
5. A POSSIBLE SOLUTION likely to be much lower than this. Similarly, just how effi-
cient is the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Cdc6 in
vivo? Or, how efficient is the export of Mcm2-7? Are
they 90, 99, 99.99 per cent efficient? Assays that can
measure intracellular concentrations of proteins over
the ranges required simply do not exist. Hopefully, the
development of more sensitive, quantitative assays for
