The cell contents become granular and in unstained sections are clearly visible,
whilst the nucleus takes on a brown colour, and the starch grains disappear. The whole
focus of degeneration soon becomes hemmed in by a many layered phellogen which is
visible to the naked eye as a rough corky deposit.


ITS STRAINS AND REACTIONS 153

THE virus oF Foutar Necrosis or X?

In 1934 my former colleague, Mr F. C. Bawden (Bawden 1934), described a disease
of the potato to which he gave the name Foliar Necrosis, ascribing it to a virus he
called D, and called attention to the fact that many of the reactions induced by this
virus were identical with, and others akin to, those produced by the X virus. Evidence
will be adduced for the view that the virus D conforms more closely to the status of a
strain of the X virus than to that of an independent species. For that reason it appears
both more correct and convenient to designate it as the X” strain of the X virus.
Whilst Foliar Necrosis was being studied the writer was working on another virus
disease in the potato which presented many similarities to it. This virus which, in the
writer’s opinion, is yet another strain of the X virus group will be here described as the
AX virus.

The essential characters of Bawden’s Foliar Necrosis and its causative virus may be
stated as follows:
