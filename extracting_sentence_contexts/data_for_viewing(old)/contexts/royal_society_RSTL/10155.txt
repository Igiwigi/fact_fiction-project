THE DETECTION AND WIDE DISTRIBUTION OF YTTRIUM. 893

under examination with strong sulphuric acid, drive off excess of acid by heat, and
finally to raise the temperature to dull redness (10). The anhydrous sulphate thus
left frequently showed the citron band in the radiant matter tube, when before this
treatment the original 8nbstance showed nothing (75).

Examination of calcium compounds.

5. My first idea was that the band might be due to a compound of lime. Much
chemical evidence tended to support this view. I have already explained that the
chemical extraction was rendered very difficult by the fact of the citron band 80
frequently turning up both in the precipitate and the filtrate. By neglecting the
portion showing leasb citron band, and separating all the elements present which gave
little or none, I could generally concentrate the citron band into a solution which
—according to our present knowledge of analytical chemistry—should contain little
else than the earths, alkaline earths, and alkalies. Ammonia added to this s0lution
would precipitate an earth (11, 14), and in the filtrate oxalic acid would precipitate
an insoluble oxalate (7, 18).

The citron band hovered between these two precipitates, being zometimes stronger
in one and sometimes in the other, It was also to be detected, but more faintly, in
the residue left after evaporating to dryness and igniting the filtrate from the oxalate.
