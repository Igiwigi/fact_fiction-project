The relation between the yard and the metre, as determined non-interferometrically,
by Szars, Jounson and Jouty, namely 1 yard = 0-91439841 metre, and the mean of
MicHetson’s and Benorr, Fasry and Prrot’s values of the metre, 1553163-82 wave-
lengths of Cd,, can be used to calculate the number of wave-lengths of Cd, in the yard. The result afforded by doing so is 1420210-5, a most satisfactory concordance with the
number now communicated. Perhaps the most interesting fact about this investigation is that the author has been
able to measure a base-line of ,!;-inch, between Grayson-ruling fiducial limit-marks of
less than a half wave-length thickness, by direct counting of the interference bands,
5423 in neon light, which are comprised in this interval. Indeed, as this has been done
