caudate nucleus, as it is turning downwards and forwards ; behind it is a space,
probably the posterior cornu of the lateral ventricle, corresponding to the position of
the grey matter at the bottom of the calcarine fissure ; in front and below, the anterior
margin of the corpus callosum forms the posterior wall of the lateral ventricle, which
here separates it from the upper end of the hippocampus major. A prolongation of the
corpus callosum is sent downwards and forwards behind the hippocampus major, but
separated from it by the lateral ventricle, the direction of the fibres being downwards.
The lateral ventricle is therefore an important landmark in this region, in distinguishing
the corpus callosum from its forceps major. The position of the forceps major in relation
to the lateral ventricle is always on its internal and inferior wall, while the tapetum is
on the external and superior, according as the section is horizontal or sagittal. At
the present level we can tell that the part of the corpus callosum now visible belongs
to the main body from the fact that it is superior to the lateral ventricle. On the
posterior and superior edge of the gyrus hippocampi there is a band of fibres whose
direction is parallel to the tapetum, from which it is separated by the ventricle ;
probably these are fibres of the forceps major.

In the next section the corpus callosum has contracted to very small dimensions ;
the direction of its fibres is downwards and slightly forwards. It is seen as a horn-


f

shaped collection of fibres, surrounded on its upper and posterior sides by the hori-
zontal fibres of the corona radiata or optic radiations. In front, the larger end of
