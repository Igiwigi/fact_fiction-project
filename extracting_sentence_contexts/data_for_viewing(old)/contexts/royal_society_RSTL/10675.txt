As regards the corona, we may perhaps point out that hitherto the position of only
one true corona line had been fixed, though two other lines had been suspected. The
corona, during the late eclipse, seems to have been especially rich in lines. THOLLON

have been able to measure about thirty additional lines, thus increasing the number
considerably.

The fact thab part of the outer corona shines by reflected light has been once more
proved by the presence of the dark FRAUNHOFER lines near G, and if any doubt
previously existed respecting the presence of dark lines in the corona spectrum,
that doubt is now completely removed.

The results have amply proved the value of the photographic method employed,
and it has been shown how an eclipse of only 70 seconds' duration can be made to
yield important information.
