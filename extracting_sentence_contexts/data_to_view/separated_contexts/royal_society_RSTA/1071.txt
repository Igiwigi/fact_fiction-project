As I said, however, Bohr’s reply
assesses EPR’s argument on their own terms, whereby it is possible to assign certain properties to
quantum objects, under the constraints of the uncertainty relations and complementarity, at the
time measurements. Bohr also assumes, as do EPR, that this assignment is in principle possible on
the basis of a prediction rather than only a measurement, albeit only predictions that are in principle
verifiable. This is in fact a necessary qualification, which requires further nuancing (discussed
below), but it is missed by EPR. Thus, both EPR and Bohr assume that the EPR experiment for (S;, 5) can be set in two
alternative ways so as to predict, with the probability equal to unity, either one or the other of
the complementary measurable quantities for Sz on the basis of measuring the corresponding
quantities for S;. Let us call this assumption ‘assumption A’.
