The nature of the substance in which the chemical change must take place,
which change reverses and so forms a cyclic process, is an almost insuperable
difficulty, since the rate at which the energy must be constantly absorbed and given
out again is considerable, and the materials present in which this chemical change
must take place are only carbon, its vapour, and the slight trace of impurities which:
the author thinks essential to the existence of the are. If the impurity be assumed to be a salt of potassium, there is the possibility that a
carbide of potassium might be formed, and that part of the P.D. might be due to the
are forming a cell, having carbon and potassium carbide as its electrodes, and the
vapour column as the electrolyte, the products produced by the flow of the current
through the cell being conceived to be destroyed in the flame which surrounds the
are proper. That a chemical combination between the carbon and surrounding gas is not the
cause of the back E.M.F., at any rate in the normal silent arcs considered here, is
evident from the fact that the arc is but little affected by the nature of the gas in
