This, however, is not true for the translational flux density and, in fact, it is
nearly identical to the numerically exact one (compare with figure 3). As an important point, this
means that an electronic flux density is accessible via a BO calculation. This fact is not restricted to
the one-dimensional case as is the construction of the electronic flux density from the continuity
equation.

5. Conclusion

We study the dynamics of coupled electronâ€”nuclear motion where the focus is on the nuclear
and electronic flux densities. A one-dimensional model is used where the interaction of a single
electron and a nucleus is parametrized such that the BO approximation holds.
