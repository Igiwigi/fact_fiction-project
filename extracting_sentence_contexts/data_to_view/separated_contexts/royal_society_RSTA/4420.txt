until ‘1’ has been by each name; this defines a set of rankings. Illustrating with figure 1, the set is

A>B>C>D>E, B>C>D>E>A, C>D>E>A>B, (23)
2.3
D>E>A>B>C, E>A>B>C>D. That these terms must play a central role in developing a comprehensive theory for voting is
suggested by the fact that the top row of equation (2.3) was used to create the equation (2.1)
example with its cyclic behaviour. A ranking wheel array is a Z; orbit of a ranking. By construction, each candidate is in first,
second, ..., last place precisely once, so no candidate is favoured: The outcome should be a tie.
