There can be no doubt that these facts are evidence of a great fault; that the beds
on the east of it are an upper portion of the Bovey deposit, preserved, through the
intervention of a vertical displacement of at least 100 feet, from the denuding action
which swept it away on the west, after it had, by its pressure, assisted to flatten the
timber in the uppermost stratum of lignite at present existing there ; and that this denu-
dation occurred before the deposition of the © Head,” since this is found covering the
deposit alike, without considerable variation in its thickness, on each side of the
< fault.” It will be understood that it is by no means intended to intimate that this is
the only fault in the Bovey formation ; the occurrence of beds of lignite, near the
Surface, in yarious parts of the Heathfield, renders it probable that there is, at least,
another. Nor is it meant to_express the opinion that the * Head ” itself may not have
lost much by denudation ; $0 far as they are at present understood, certain facts 8eem
to imply that it may have suffered much in this way.

Though the neighbourhood of Bovey was necessarily regarded as the head-quarters
of the formation, it was felt to be desirable that some attention should be given to
certain other localities, in various parts of the basin, where clay-pits exist.

The clay-works at Aller, in the parish of Abbotskerswill, adjacent to the road from
Torquay to Newton, and about two miles from the latter, have been abandoned some
years. Lignite seems to have been found there in considerable quantity, Samples of
