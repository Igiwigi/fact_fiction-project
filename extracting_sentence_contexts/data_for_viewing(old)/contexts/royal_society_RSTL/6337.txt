destitute of them (as. Professxor WILLIAMSON has pointed. out in Polystomella, orispa);
and such forms differ much less widely, as. regards: this character, from the simpler
forms of Calcarina, than these last do from the very complex forms which have been
shown (©þ 197) to be connected with them by a. continuously gradational series. Hence
I cannot regard the remarkable development of the supplemental skeleton in Calcaring
as affording any disproof of the idea of its genetic relationship to Rotalia, to which its
affinity in every other particular is most intimate.

250. If, again, we inquire into the import of that remarkable development of the
canal-syslem, which seems to be the distinctive feature of Polystomella, we find that if
we base our judgment upon a sufficiently wide foundation of facts, its non-essential
character becomes apparent. For although the large P. craticulata of the tropical and
Anustralian seas presents the most symmetrical and extensive distribution of the canal-
system that I have anywhere met with (|< 187-191), the. little P. erispa of our own
seas exhibits but feeble traces of it (| 192); yet of the intimacy of their relationship
no doubt can be fairly entertained. We have traced a parallel difference between the
gigantic Amphistegina Cumingii and the comparatively diminutive A. gibbosa (T 171).
And the like difference has been shown to. exist between the two forms of Tinoporus
(7 222), where its presence or absence is obviously associated with the presence or
absence of the radiating prolongations and of the supplemental skeleton from which
these proceed.

251. In considering: the import of the canal-system as a character for the systematist,
