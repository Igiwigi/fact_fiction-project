The unweighted means of the columns show in a striking manner the trend described
above, increasing as they do in value as the columns are passed over from left to right.
This confirms the conclusion arrived at above by the consideration of individual class
means, namely, that the more damaged specimens tend to be larger than the less damaged.
It should be added that, in unconsciously relaxing his standards for the larger specimens,
Rowe was influenced by taxonomic considerations that turn upon relative growth rates.

To anticipate a little here, it may be said that Rowe defined both Epzaster gibbus and
Muicraster coranguinum var. latior in terms of characters which show allometric growth.
Thus in selecting for Epiaster gibbus, for the passage forms between this species and
Muicraster coranguinum, and for M. coranguinum var. latior he was led to favour large speci-
mens, because, other things being equal, the larger the specimen the better developed
the diagnostic characters would be. â€˜This is numerically demonstrated in table 4 by the fact
that, in these three cases the row means are larger, and the row variances smaller, than
for M. coranguinum auctorum. In addition, on this hypothesis Epiaster gibbus should have a
larger mean and a smaller variance than its passage form, the selection of large forms
having been more marked in the former than in the latter. And so it has, as is demon-
strated by the table.

(c) The age distribution of the sample

The Northfleet population of fossils itself is already unrepresentative of the original
living community from which it was derived. A specimen which is now preserved in the
chalk must have survived many hazards since it was part of a living echinoid. To start
with, the animal must have died in some way which did not involve the destruction of
