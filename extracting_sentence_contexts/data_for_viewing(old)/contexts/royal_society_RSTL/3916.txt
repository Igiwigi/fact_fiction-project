The subsequent discovery of two grades of organization in the class of Cephalopods,
consequent on the dissection of the Nautilus Pompilius ||, called for a closer investi-
gation of the affinities of the Belemnites, and led to an attempt to establish a more
definite approximation of these with the other families of siphoniferous Cephalopods,
now ranked under two distinct orders of the class.

The first evidence that bore directly upon the question of the position of the Belem-
nite in this class, was detected by Dr. BuckxLaxny@ and M. Acass1z** in specimens
of Belemnite from the lias at Lyme Regis, in which the fossil ink-bag was preserved
in the basal chamber of the phragmocone, or that formed by the anterior prolonga-
tion and expansion of its capsule.

The importance of this discovery depends chiefly on the facts, that the secreting
gland and reservoir of the inky secretion common to all the naked Cephalopods do
not exist in the recent Nautilus Pompilius, and that no trace of them has ever been

* Such was Mr. MrLLus's opinion ; but, as it was unsupported by microscopic investigation, or by any facts
like that above cited, it was not accepted by Prof. Ds BuaiviLLy and Dr. BuckLaxp.
