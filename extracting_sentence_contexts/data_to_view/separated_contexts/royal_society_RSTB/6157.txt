* Sacer (1933) reports cytological changes of very
slight degree in the centre median nucleus after lesions of the frontal lobe in two
monkeys, and concludes “ qu’il est en relation d’une part, avec l’écorce frontale
et d’autre part, avec la zone corticale correspondent 4 la face.’ His microphoto-
graphs, however, are far from convincing and we think it probable that his conclusion
rests on an error of interpretation, related to the fact that the centre median nucleus
in normal brains shows a certain degree of individual variation in the density and
spacing of its constituent cells. Until and unless more convincing evidence of a
positive nature is forthcoming, the conception of a direct cortical connection of the
nucleus should be abandoned. * Sacer (1933, p. 115) is in error in attributing to one of us the statement that the centre median
nucleus is in relation with the frontal cortex.
