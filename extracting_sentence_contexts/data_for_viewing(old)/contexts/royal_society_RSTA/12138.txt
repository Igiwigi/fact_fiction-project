substances, He used both the oxy-hydrogen and oxy-coal-gas flames. He attributes
only line spectra to copper, bismuth, lead, gold, iron, manganese, chromium, tin,
potassium, sodium, lithium, zinc, cadmium, mercury, silver, barium, strontium, and
calcium. He figures banded spectra of the following elements, magnesium, lines and
bands ; sulphur, selenium, tellurium, phosphorus, boron, iodine (bromine and chlorine,

Cyanogen and ammonia are also figured as giving channelled spectra, as well as the
following metallic chlorides and oxides :—

PbO, PbCl,, AuCl,, Fe,O, or FeO, MnO or Mn,O,, CuCl,, CuBr,, Cul,, CuF,, and
