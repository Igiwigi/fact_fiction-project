how and why one would need to adopt the IBH, as opposed
to one of its weaker forms, to incorporate these facts. To make
my confusion more transparent, consider three properties of a
person that we might want to understand: their observable
behaviour, their cognition and their conscious experience.
Let’s consider these in the light of an experiment that IBH
advocates have mustered: the experiment by Auvray ef al.
[4], discussed above (cf. figure 1). In this study, participants
find each other’s sensors, even though they themselves
appear unaware of whether they are finding a sensor or a
shadow. One could quibble about various aspects of this
example as a good example of the IBH in action (it is not par-
ticularly ‘ecologically valid’; the fact that the subjects cannot
explicitly distinguish sensor from shadow does not show that
their brains are not representing this distinction, just uncon-
sciously; etc.), but let us take it as an example nonetheless.
Now the question is: what exactly does this experiment
show? It shows that coupled causal interactions between
two people are required to explain something—what is
that? As far as I can tell, it is only a certain aspect of behav-
iour. Yes, the behaviour of the system cannot be explained
only by events in individual brains. Me riding a bicycle
also cannot be explained only by events in my brain. Much
of our behaviour comes about through complex causal
interactions between our brains and the world, and social
