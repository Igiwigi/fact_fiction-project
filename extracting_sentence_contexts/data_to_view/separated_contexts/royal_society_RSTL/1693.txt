That the greatest of all the mean variations is nearly :016 inch in
amount, and occurs in the afternoon minimum height of the baro-
meter at four o'clock ; the next 012 inch, and found in the forenoon
maximum at ten o'clock ; after this the one of nearly *011 inch in
the evening maximum at eleven o'clock ; and finally that of -005
inch occurring in the morning minimum at half-past four.

8. That the general relation between the barometrical changes and the
yariations of temperature, appears to be direct during the morning
hours, and inverse during those of the day and evening.

9. The singular fact, that while a period of fifteen days gives a mean day
generally distinguished by its relative variations at noon and mid-
night, a period of one month, or a complete lunation, not only gives
a gradual succession of variations, but, in all these obseryations, a
result almost identical in character and amount with the combined
result of the whole. Among the investigations in which I am at present engaged, are those
relating to the following inquiries: 1. To ascertain whether the mercurial
vapour in the vacuum chamber of the barometer, sensibly influences the
height of the column at the ordinary variations of the temperature of the
atmosphere. 2.
