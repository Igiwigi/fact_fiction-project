It was thus evident that spermatozoa, even of the previously paired Frog, still retained
their power of penetrating into dead eggs, as these ultimately proved to be, after
careful preservation to the sixth day in a favourable temperature. The spermatozoa
were distinctly visible within the envelopes, without change of position, for several
hours, but no fecundation was effected by them ; no chamber was formed in either
of the eggs, no segmentation took place, nor was any embryo produced. 'Phese
cireumstances seem to Show that the eggs were already dead, as was supposed, before
contact of the spermatozoon ; consequently that the entrance of the spermatozoon
into the envelope is due to a power inherent in the penetrating body, and not simply
to an attraction on the part of the yelk ; although from the fact that the spermatozoa
usually enter in a centripetal direction, it is probable that some influence may be
exerted by the yelk or its vesicle, although penetration is mainly the result of force
in the spermatozoon. The facts now 8tated of penetration by the spermatozoon seem to Jead us better
to understand the nature of some experiments with solutions of caustic potass, which
are detailed in my former paper. I have repeated these experiments, during the past
season, in the presence of several friends, Professors Saarvey, Eris, and BELL, and
Messrs. Buss, Tours and WargRnovst, with resn]ts precisely similar to: those which

are detailed in that paper ; viz. that when dilated spermatic fluid, recently obtained,
is applied to a set of eggs, and—as s00n afterwards as the experiment can be made,
a solution of potass,—of snch a strength as is known by previous microscopic observa-
tion to have the property of instantly decomposing the spermatic body,—the solution
being wasbed away quiekly after its application, by repeated quantities of water,—
to prevent. its affecting the egg itself—that then—in some- instances—even when the
interval of time between the application of the spermatic fluid and the subsequent ap-
plication of the potass does not exceed a few seconds,—impregnation of the egg is
effected; as is proved by the formation of the chamber, the segmentation of the
yelk, and perhaps the formation of an embryo.
