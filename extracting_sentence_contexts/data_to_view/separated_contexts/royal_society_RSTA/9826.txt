The Rigorous Expression for the Harmones of the Second Kind. The integral Q; denotes 33,'(%) Q'(%), and %B, denotes Qi(n) 23/(%). Thus
0

G; is, in fact, the harmonic function of the second kind. 4%; is clearly determinable
from @;*. In the original paper @,* was found by quadrature, and this defect in my procedure
is referred to by M. Lrapounorr as a cause possibly contributory to the discrepancy
between our results.
