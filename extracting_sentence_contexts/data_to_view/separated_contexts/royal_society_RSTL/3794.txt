In the higher forms
of Chilopoda, as in Scolopendra, there are only twenty-three; and in Lithobius and
Seutigera fifteen, besides the brain and medulla. In Geophilus subterraneus (fig. 11, 12.) the brain (b) exhibits a condition similar
to that of Polydesmus, in the almost entire absence of optic nerves. But it differs
in the fact that the optic ganglia (c) are slightly developed at its sides, and that these
give off a very minute filament to the single ocellus, which exists on the under side
of the head, behind the antenna. Treviranus+ has described the brain in Geophilus
longicornis, Leacn, as entirely without organs of vision; but from the existence of
an ocellus in that species also, on each side behind the antenna, he has probably over-
looked its minute nerve. The brain itself is large, as compared with the size of the
head, and the ganglia of the antennz (a) have almost completely coalesced with it.
