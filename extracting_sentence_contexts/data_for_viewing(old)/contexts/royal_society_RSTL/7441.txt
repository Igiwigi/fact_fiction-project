is exercised. The facts indicate that the result consists in an alteration of the mode of
contraction of the heart. That part therefore of the nervous system which presides over
tFe movements of that organ must be concerned in its production. But the effect may
I brought about either by agencies which are entirely mechanical, 4. e. altered relations
between the pressures existing in different parts of the circulation, or may be also more
le due to changes in the chemical state of the circulating fluid. For this reason
te proper course seems to be, first to determine to what extent the increased activity
& the heart which follows each inspiration may be accounted for as a mechanical effect
o&the expansion of the chest. Then, even if it be found that the whole of the obseryed
pEenomena may be thus explained, it will still be open to question how far the chemical
&n8equences of each respiration may be also concerned in their production.
=The effect of the respiratory moyements on the arterial pressure stands in relation to
the fact, demonstrated by DoxbRs, that all the organs contained in the chest are kept
when its walls are at rest (as e. 9. after death) in a state of distension, s0 that the mass of
fEe thoracic viscera has constantly a tendency to shrink to a 8maller volume than that of
t&e cavity in which they are contained. As all of these organs possess elasticity, they must
ngcessarily all participate in any expansion of the whole mass, but inasmuch as they resist,
pansion mn very different degrees, their participation is unequal. Of the four principal
nds of organs contained in the chest, viz. the lungs, veins, arteries, and heart, the
zteries and heart (when contracted) are by far least capable of distension, for they are
Zready distended by an internal pressure equal to that of 5 to 7 inches of mercury.
nsequently in inspiration the arteries and contracting heart take little or no part in
e amplification of the chest ; s0 that the increase of bulk produced by dilatation of
fe thorax is for the most part divided between the lungs, the great veins, and the heart
when in a state of relaxation. The actual ratio between the resistance to expansion of
