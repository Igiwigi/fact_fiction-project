Namib Desert grass [16]. While some species of cacti have flattened spines, such as Sclerocactus
papyracanthus [17], in general, cactus spines can be considered to be conical in nature [18] but do
vary considerably in size and dimensions and, if not straight, can be hooked, twisted or curved
with an array of colours and texture [19]. The dew droplets are further driven from the tip to
the base of the cactus spines by the surface roughness gradient that was found to be higher at the
tip (Ra = 0.71 + 0.064 1m and R, = 10.23 + 0.41 pm) which had narrower microgrooves compared
with the spine’s bases that had wider microgrooves (and surface roughness parameters, Ra =
0.56 + 0.14 1m and R;z = 7.65 + 2.45 1m). This gradient of roughness creates a wettability gradient
which gives rise to the surface free energy gradient that acts on the droplets.
Lorenceau & Quéré [20] studied the movement of water droplets against gravity on a conical
wire and identified the Laplace pressure gradient as the decisive force. However, the wettability
of a surface may also play a role in the harvesting of dew on cactus spines and is something that
future research could explore. In fact, Luo [18] discussed the movement of fog droplets along
conical cactus spines and they developed a model to interpret the movement of barrel-shaped
droplets driven by liquid pressure differences within the drop. Even if the spine shapes are not
conical, all are tapered from their base to their tip, which could also drive surface droplets that
have formed on the spines from dew or fog to move from the area that has a lower cross-section
radius to the region of higher radius [21].
The results gained above justified further analysis of the movement of water on the spines
(using fluorescent labelled water) and within the stem of the plants (using MRI scans).

(b) Fluorescent nanoparticle imaging

Having captured time-lapse images of dew droplets on the surface of C. cinerea, which showed the
drops moving from the spine tips to the bases, this was further tested using fluorescent labelled
