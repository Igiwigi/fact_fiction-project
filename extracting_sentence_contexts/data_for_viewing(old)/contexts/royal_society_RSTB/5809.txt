drainage line half-way to the Pyramids, formerly mentioned. This is somewhat un-
expected.

The minimum positions of Pit XVI show a remarkable feature, depicted more fully
in fig. 38, p. 370, in that the curve approximates much more closely than that of Pit IIT
to a typical “ sakia” curve as drawn by Ferrar or AupEBEAU. In spite of the repeated
accessions of water from the canals, the level at the trough of the canal-wave sinks
steadily lower during summer, and is more suddenly intercepted by the flood-rise than
in Pit III. Again the importance of the western drainage line is emphasised, in contra-
distinction to the backflow to the river on the east, which we should otherwise have
assumed.

But if we examine, e.g., fig. 27, p. 361, bearing this fact in mind, it will seem very
likely that—at any rate in July—the source of the water in Pit III ought to lie
