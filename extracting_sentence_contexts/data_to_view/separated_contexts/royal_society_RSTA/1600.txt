ON THE RICHARDSON GYRO-MAGNETIC EFFECT. 287 The further fact which may be deduced from the last column of the table, that the
eddy currents have practically died down in a few thousandths of a second, is thus
superfluous to prove that their momentum is entirely too small to influence the measure-
ments of the R effect. There was, however, just the chance that some unsuspected
direct action of the field on the eddy currents might result in an incompletely
eliminated throw error, and for this reason we persevered in the experiments with the
copper sheath. Table XT. contains the results of the five determinations made.
