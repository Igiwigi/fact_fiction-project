values of eigenvector centrality are those that have most influ-
ence on the entire network. More generally, there are a range of
other statistical methods available for constructing and analys-
ing networks, and these are likely to apply to the domain of
leadership as well (e.g. [81]).

One challenge that has not been dealt with particularly well
methodologically is that such a dyadic perspective will fail to
be realistic if there are significant non-dyadic influence relation-
ships. For example, if individual C only follows when both
A and B initiate, but not when either initiates alone, this triadic
relationship would be difficult to capture using standard
network tools. Such non-dyadic interactions may in fact be
key to the decision-making process, for example, through the
well-documented use of quorum rules in animal group
decisions [82-85]. One approach that could prove useful here
is maximum entropy modelling. This is an information-theoretic
approach (distinct from the approaches described above)
which can quantify how much of the information contained
in a joint distribution (e.g. of group states) is accounted for
by pairwise relationships alone, as opposed to higher-order
interactions. Maximum entropy modelling, which has already
been successfully employed to describe the dynamics of bird
flocks [86], could give insight into whether pairwise inter-
actions represent a good approximation of the system
