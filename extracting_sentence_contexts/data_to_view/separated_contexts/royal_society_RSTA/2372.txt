While historically there was an emphasis on considering
particular subsets of cages encompassing both those of the preferred crystal phase and perhaps
a few others (e.g. the 5126n_41510gm cages where n=O, 2, 3, 4 and m=2, 3, 4), it is becoming
increasingly clear that there is a plethora of transient cages from which more common and more
stable cages arise as hydrate nucleation proceeds, again strongly indicating ordering in stages. For
example, early on in the nucleation process, irregular and defective cages are prominent structural
features, and appear in interfacial regions between the solution phase and the hydrate nucleus
[119]. An ordering-in-stages perspective on gas hydrate nucleation is also supported by the fact
that nascent ordering according to water-based molecular-level order parameters apparently
precedes the appearance of cages, suggesting that lower level ordering (e.g. at the molecular
level) is needed before larger and more elaborate ordered structures can appear [25]. Moreover,
distributions of local order parameters (e.g. Sg and MSD) change and narrow continuously
throughout the nucleation process.
