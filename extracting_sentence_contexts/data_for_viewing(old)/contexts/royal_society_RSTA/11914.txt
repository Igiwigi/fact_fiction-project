and negative, proves that the form of the curve has been largely modified by this last
point. If this observation be neglected, the linear equation

Ye = Yo (1 — 001188)

gives a much better agreement than Browat’s parabolic expression, the mean differ-
eace being only + 2 parts in 1000. It would, therefore, appear that BronaT was
Rrdly justified in using his parabolic equation ; indeed, even apart from the fact that
tRe boiling-point of the carbon bisulphide used by him is 2° higher than those obtained
¥§ ourselves and the other observers quoted on p. 644, we think that the character of
ls experimental data scarcely warrants the acceptance of his equation as representing
e true temperature variation of the rotation in carbon bisulphide.
‘g Independent evidence in support of this conclusion lies in the fact that if Lord
Raviercn’s value for the rotation in carbon bisulphide at 18° be reduced to 0° by
dgr expression for the temperature variation, it agrees much Letter with the deter-
Bination made at 0° by BecquereL than when it is reduced by means of Browat’s
