Euclidean [69]. Moreover, apparent distances computed in
morphospaces may be misleading where constraints on vari-
ation limit the range of possible morphotypes [70]. The
evolutionary spaces described above include a range of topol-
ogies (table 1), although many spaces are often assumed to be
at least metric, if not Euclidean [4,5,68,71]. A substantial chal-
lenge in evolutionary biology, and one that has achieved
too little attention, is adjusting our Euclidean intuitions to
the evolutionary dynamics in spaces of different topologies.

5. Topology of evolution

The enduring interest in evolutionary spaces reflects the fact
that while some spaces are a description of empirical pat-
terns, all of the spaces provide useful intuitions about the
evolutionary process (which is why Wright introduced geno-
typic spaces). This section addresses the relationships and
possible discontinuities between spaces, and then elaborates
on the difference between adaptive searches within an
existing space and the construction of new spaces.

One might argue that all spaces are ultimately derived from
a vast sequence space and mappings from that into a pheno-
typic space. But the existence of discontinuities between
spaces is implicit in Wagner's distinction between macromol-
