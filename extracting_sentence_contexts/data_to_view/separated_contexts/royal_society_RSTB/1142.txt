A connection between the posterior root fibres and
the lateral column, presumably by means of fibres in the posterior column or cornu,
must therefore exist. This connection is, however, of such a special kind that it
offers an evident resistance to the passage of impulses backwards from the cord into
the root. The fact that no effects in the above experiment could be obtained when,
with the lateral column as the gole bridge between the excited upper portion of
the cord and the nerves, the posterior columns were excited, shows that any spread
of path from the posterior to the lateral columns, if it exists, must either be below
the level of the section (12th dorsal) or must offer a resistance â€œto the passage of
impulses in the downward direction which it does not offer to their passage in the
upward direction, that is, in their ascent towards higher centres. The relations which the cord columns appear to have -with one another, as given in
the summary of Chapter VIIL., are in this respect of great interest and importance. Two results are clearly brought out by the consideration of the series of experiments
in the whole of this section; the first that the analogous character of the general
electrical results in cord and nerve, without being pushed too far, may be extended to
this point, that the stimulation of any one column in the cord is a localised stimulation
of the nerve fibres in that column only, and the secon, that the resulting nerve
