Should further experiments bear out this contention, it seems that very great care
must be exercised in the use of materials having a higher maximum stress than that
corresponding to alternations of equal and opposite stresses. Below the static yield-point, iron and steel appear to be capable of maintaining an
unstable condition for a considerable time against cyclical variations of stress which
ultimately produce a considerable change of length. The first application of the
maximum stress in a given cycle may show only a scarcely measurable extension,
in spite of the fact that extension of thousands of times the amount may be obtained
without any change in the cycle of stresses. It would appear from this that
BavscHINGER’s definitions of the “ primitive” and “natural” elastic limits are in
