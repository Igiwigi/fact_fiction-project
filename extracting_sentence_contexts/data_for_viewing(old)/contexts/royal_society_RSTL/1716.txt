rating on the aeriform compounds of charcoal gives more
accurate results than rapid combustion by the electric spark,
being never attended with that precipitation of charcoal, which
is often observed when the gases are exploded with oxygen.
A regulated temperature, also, effects the analysis of such
mixtures much more correctly than the action of the sponge
or balls, because in the latter case the heat produced is un-
certain; and though sometimes adequate to the effect, yet
there is always a risk that it may exceed, or fall short of
that degree, which is required for the successful result of the
analytic process.

From the facts which have been 5stated, I derived a method
of obtaining carburetted hydrogen gas perfectly free from
olefiant gas, hydrogen, and carbonic oxide, and mixed only
with a little oxygen, which, had it been necessary to my pur-
pose, might also have been separated. The early product of
the distillation of pit-coal was washed with a watery solution
