Dashed lines indicate polar contacts. (d) ATP-induced conformational changes in the
SBD. Overlay of the SBD of E. coli DnaK in the ATP-bound open conformation (PDB ID 4890; SBD, dark red; SBD, orange, truncated for space reasons) with the
structure of the isolated SBD of Â£. coli DnaK (PDB ID 1DKX; [34]; SBD, dark green; SBDa,, lime green). Indicated are the substrate (light green) enclosing loops (left
panel) and residues lining the central hydrophobic substrate-binding pocket (right panel).

resulting in simultaneous reduction of basal and stimulated with the fact that the isolated NBD (DnaK(2-385)) has an
ATPase rates. Thus, this comparison suggests that the SBD ATPase rate similar to the basal rate of full-length wild-type
represses the ATPase activity until substrate binding releases Dnak. However, the NBD including the interdomain linker

this repression.
