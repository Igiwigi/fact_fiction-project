D. H. SCOTT ON THE STRUCTURE AND AFFINITIES

drawn out longer, while the vascular bundle below is also cut obliquely, facts which
indicate that the section was at an angle between the tangential and horizontal
planes. At the opposite end the integument is completely closed, without the least
indication of any crevice. It is obvious that at this closed end the section approaches
either the distal or the proximal extremity of the “seed.” The form of the section at
the closed end is, however, far too narrow for the distal region (ef. phots. 14 and 16),
and we thus arrive at the conclusion that it is the proximal end of the seed which is
completely inclosed by the integument, a conclusion which agrees with all the rest of
the evidence.
