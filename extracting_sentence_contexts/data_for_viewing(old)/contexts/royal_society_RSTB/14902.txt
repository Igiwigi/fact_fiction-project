similar partitioning of the morphospace. ment for replication, which, as mentioned above, can be

satisfied by species and communities that live on islands or
in lakes. However, ecological communities in these habitats
are often less complex than elsewhere. Thus, if ecological com-
plexity affects evolutionary repeatability, our perceptions of the
degree and prevalence of repeatability may be skewed.
Another challenge is that populations or communities
where parallel evolution is observed are not true replicates.
Quasi-replicates vary at least somewhat in the environment
they experience and in their initial state (community struc-
ture, genetic composition of member species, population
sizes, etc.). On the one hand, the fact that parallelism is
observed despite these ‘extrinsic’ differences between quasi-
replicates suggests that evolution would have been even
more repeatable among true replicates. On the other hand,
extrinsic variation compromises our ability to interpret any
quantitative measure of repeatability. Specifically, if some
quasi-replicates did not evolve in parallel, it is unclear
whether the lack of parallelism should be attributed to the
intrinsic randomness and contingency of evolution or to the
extrinsic variation between quasi-replicates. Imagine that 50
out of 100 quasi-replicates evolved character state A and the
other 50 evolved character state B. Clearly, evolution is some-
what but not perfectly repeatable. This lack of perfect
