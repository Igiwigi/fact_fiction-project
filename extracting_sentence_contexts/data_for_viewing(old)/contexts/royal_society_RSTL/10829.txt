MR. C. A. BELL ON THE SYMPATHETIC VIBRATIONS OF JETS, 417

similar to those seen in liquid jets, and that these changes grow along the jet-path.
T have only been able 80 far to observe this drop-like appearance in jets at low pres-
gure, and even then the outline is 80mewhat obscured by trails of smoke detached
from the 8tream. T hope, however, to succeed in getting good photographs of jets at
high velocities. The practical difficulties in the way can no doubb be overcome,

Tt 8eems to me that the true key to an explanation of the vibratory phenomena of
both liquid and gaseous jets is to be found in the fact that the velocity of the stream
is8uing from a circular orifice is not equal at all points, but diminishes from the centre,
or jet axis, outwards. When the efflux takes place from a straight circular tube (and
even 8uch a jeb is © sensitive”) this may be caused by adhesion of the fluid to the
sides of the tube, or by friction; but when the jet issues from a hole in a thin plate it
is no doubt chiefly due to the convergence of the stream lines towards the orifice.
This will tend to cause retardation of the normal velocity of the outer layers of fluid:
indeed at the orifice the ontermost layer of a liquid must be in a state of absolute
rest., The fall in velocity from the centre of the stream outwards must evidently be
more 8teep in small jets than in large ones; and as I have pointed out, it is precisely
the former which give the most accurate reproduction of impressed vibrations. |

The normal jet, then, as it leaves the orifice is composed of an infinite number of
