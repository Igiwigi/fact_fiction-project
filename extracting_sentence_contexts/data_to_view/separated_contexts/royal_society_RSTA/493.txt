Velocity distribution in returning wave originating from: I, unit pulse, H(¢+x);
II, finite pulse, {H(¢+x) —H(t+x—2b)}; ILL, finite pulse, {H(¢+x) —H(t+x—0-6(26))}. 548 W. CHESTER ON THE PROPAGATION OF SOUND

step-functions, it follows that any finite discontinuity in the incident wave will disappear
in the returning wave. In fact, by virtue of the integrating property in the first region, they
become discontinuities in the velocity derivatives. This is verified by the two graphs in
figure 11, which describe the returning wave originating from a finite pulse of length z in
which the velocities are represented, respectively, by

—{B' (t+) —B'(t+-x—2bz)} and —{H(t+x) —H(ét+x—26z)},

where 8’ is given by (65). The two cases z = 0-6, z = 1-0 are shown in the figure.
