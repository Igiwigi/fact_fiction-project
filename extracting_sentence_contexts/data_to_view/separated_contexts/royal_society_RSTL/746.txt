BERTHOLLET thinks this fact 80 unaccountable, that he has
been willing to discard it altogether. Whether the view
which I have just opened, of the relation subsisting between
the elastic force, density, and latent heat of different vapours,
harmonize with chemical phenomena in general, I leave to
others to determine. It certainly agrees with that unaccount-
able fact. Whatever be the fate of the investigation of the
general law now respectfully offered, the statement of Mr.
Warr may be implicitly received under the sanction of his
acknowledged sagacity and candour. CONCLUSION.
