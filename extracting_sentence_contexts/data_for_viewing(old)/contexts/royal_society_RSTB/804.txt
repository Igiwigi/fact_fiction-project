With regard to the skull of Megaladapis, it may be remarked that the low cranium,
with an almost straight upper profile and an elongate facial portion, would be regarded
by most paleontologists as primitive.* There are, however, several considerations
which seem to indicate that in many cases it is in reality a highly specialized feature.
Firstly, the increase of the facial portion of a skull, both in a vertical and a horizontal
direction, is often obviously due in great part to the specialization of the teeth. The
molars, generally speaking, are increased vertically and sometimes horizontally, and
the canines are transformed into tusks and weapons of different kinds. Secondly, other
facts of ontogeny and phylogeny also suggest the same conclusion ; for any skull
during growth from the immature state to old age} and any type of Mammalian skull
(e.g., the Ungulate) traced from Eocene times to the present day, almost invariably
shows the gradual diminution of the cranial and the concomitant elongation of the
