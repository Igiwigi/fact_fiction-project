The methods of breeding were the same as those used for the experiments with
S. vetulus described by the author in 1913-14. The animals were kept throughout
in cylindrical glass tubes, 10 X 3 em., when corked containing about 50 c.c. of water
and 15 cc. of air. One individual only was kept in each tube, and when a mature
specimen produced a brood of young, this was removed and measured within
24 hours (with insignificant exceptions). The culture medium used was, as before,
the water from a heated tank containing living Lepidosiren paradowa fed daily with
Anodonta. The water in this tank, which is changed weekly, contains ‘a large
amount of organic matter and infusoria, and has proved “an excellent medium for
cultivating Cladocera of various species. A large jar of water was taken from this
tank on alternate days and strained through linen to avoid all chance of infection
with foreign strains of Simocephalus (though, as a matter of fact, none were ever
observed in the tank). The jar of tank-water was then brought into the room in
which the breeding tubes were kept, in order to bring it to the same temperature,
and on the day following it was used to renew the water in the breeding tubes. The
Simocephalus was picked out of the tube with a pipette, the water poured away, and
then the animal returned and fresh water added. The vessel containing the tank-
water was well shaken up before filling each tube, so that every Simocephalus was
provided on the same day with approximately the same amount of a practically
identical medium. Before using an old tube for a new specimen it was always well
sponged out and sterilised by heat in order to remove bacterial growth from the
sides. By these means it was hoped to keep the conditions under which the animals
were living as nearly identical as possible for them all, and to insure that should any
slight differences develop among the tubes, these should be equalised the next time
