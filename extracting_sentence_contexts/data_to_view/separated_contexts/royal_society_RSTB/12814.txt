The outcome of invasion by a pathogen is then determined
by whether its intrinsic ability to establish within the host

environment is greater than the combined resistance of the (a) Regulation of available resources

We take as our starting point a host with a baseline level should minimize the nutrients that support microbial

a reasonable default given the impracticality of completely consumed by microbes [56-58].
