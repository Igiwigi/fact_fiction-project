THE ELECTRIC AND LUMINIFEROUS MEDIUM. 795

steady equilibrium state with excessively great effective elasticity, while the
ractions necessary to equilibrate a free boundary are non-existent. Such a hypo-
esis looks like explaining one wether by means of a new one, but it is perhaps not
ally more complicated than the facts ; on our present principle of interpretation, the
hange of gravitation in the field due to a disturbance at any point must have been
propagated somehow, while in the machinery that transmits electric and luminiterous
isturbances no elasticity has yet been recognized anywhere near intense enough to
‘ake part in such a propagation. _ We may not surmount the difficulty by the assumption that, in addition to the
finite resistance to rotation which is the cause of the propagation of the radiation, the
medium also possesses an enormously greater static resistance to rotations of some
more fine-grained structure, and that the surface integral of the rotation over any
surface enclosing a vortex-atom is a positive constant, of course definite and unchange-
able in value for each atom ; for this would lead to gravitational repulsion instead of
attraction.
