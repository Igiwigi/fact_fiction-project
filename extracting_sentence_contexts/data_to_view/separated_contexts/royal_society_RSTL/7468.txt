'The rills are, under favourable lights, seen to be really fissures with
one dark and one Ag side—deep dark fissures. Rills of this remarkable cha-
racter do not appear to be branched ; and in this respect the long rill of Hygi I.
on Mivuer's map for ninety-two miles, may be compared SG the po FA ie
England dyke, which extends from Teesdale to near the Peak on the coast of Yorkshire,
seventy miles, without a branch. Contraction, rather than violent movement of the
< moon's crust, 8eems to 8uit best the facts observed; and the same explanation may be
S fairly applied to most of the fissures filled with whinstone in the coalfields of Durham
» and Northumberland. Still the straight rill near Tebit (called the Railroad), nearly on
= the central meridian of the moon, bears the appearance of dislocation in the shadow
S thrown by one side,
£ The rill which descends from Herodotus is of a different but equally remarkable cha-
Sxacter. Parting from that dark crater—full perhaps of augitic compounds, in strange
@contrast with its neighbour Aristarchus, which shines as if formed of white trachyte—
E the rill takes a winding course with some irregularity of width and appearance, till it
= opens into what resembles an old delta, or dried gulf, margined by cliffs, and undulated
