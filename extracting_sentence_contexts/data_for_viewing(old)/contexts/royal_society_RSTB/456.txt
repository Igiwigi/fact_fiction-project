(2.) That the duct of the sudorific glands in passing outwards between the papilla,
is bound up, as in a bundle, with the adjacent head of each of two neighbouring
papille. So that if the sudorific duct is symbolised by the printed letter I, a section
across the ridges might be symbolised by a row of the letters Y and I printed
alternately, thus—YIYIYIY. Then the union of the I with the adjacent prongs of
two Y’s forms the foundation of a ridge, and the clefts between the heads of the
Y’s correspond to the furrows. :


MR. F. GALTON ON THE PATTERNS IN THUMB AND FINGER MARKS. 3

There is, I believe, no adequate explanation of the fact that the prominences
through which the ducts issue, on the bulbs of the finger, and in some other parts,
are strongly disposed to arrange themselves into continuous ridges, and not to form
isolated craters. There is, however, abundant analogy in the animal kingdom of
external ridges of various sorts running in a variety of spirals and whorls.

Obtaining Impressions.

The impressions in my collection were made by thinly inking a copper plate with
printer's ink, by means of a printer's roller. The plate was about eight inches by
twelve, and fixed to a solid block of wood. The thumb was rather lightly rolled on
the inked plate, not simply pressed upon it, and then rolled on paper. Thus the
impression it left was a cylindrical projection of the whole bulb of the thumb,
