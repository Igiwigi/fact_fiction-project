For the second and third arrivals of station 2, two lines can be drawn which are
tangential to the multiple refraction curve, but again the residuals are considerable.
One of these lines has a slope equivalent to the velocity (8200 ft./s, 2-50 km/s) where the
gradient becomes zero, and the second a slope equivalent to 6450 ft./s (1-97 km/s).

The second arrivals of station 3 lie on a line of smaller slope than the two low-velocity
lines of stations 1 and 2, which is equivalent to a velocity of approximately 7200 ft./s
(2-19 km/s) ; the residuals are no greater than would be expected from the accuracy with
which the arrival times can be taken from the records.

An objection to the hypothesis that the second and third arrivals represent tracks
through a layer of constant velocity within the region of the velocity gradient lies in the
fact that the constant-velocity layer lying immediately below this region must be of great
thickness compared with any layers of constant velocity which lie above it. This layer,
however, does not produce good second arrivals. It is possible that the second arrivals of
station 3 do represent the layer of constant velocity below the gradient region, the value
of this velocity being less than that for station 2 in which, as has been shown above, the
value has been determined with accuracy. An objection to this explanation is that the

evidence from all the multiple refractions for the three stations points to the same gradient
value in the upper layers and the consequent improbability that different asymptotic
values of the velocity would be reached.
