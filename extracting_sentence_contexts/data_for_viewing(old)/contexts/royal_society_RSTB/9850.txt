capacities. Often individuals with high-functioning autism are
diagnosed in early adulthood when the core autistic symptoms
prevent successful professional activities and other forms of
social integration.

With regard to autism, a long-standing and prominent
suggestion has been that the characteristic social deficits
of autism can be construed as a failure of a ‘theory of
mind’, i.e. a specific inability to take into account the mental
states of others. Interestingly, many individuals with high-
functioning autism, however, are actually able to do exactly
this in the form of explicit mental state attribution (cf. [27])
and may, in fact, spend much more time thinking about other
people’s mental states than most non-autistic persons, because
they try to make use of this ability in an attempt to compensate
for their inability to engage in social interactions. Also, it has
been shown that when individuals with high-functioning
autism are prompted to use explicit mental state attribution,
not only can they do this, but this leads to a recruitment of simi-
lar brain regions as in neurotypicals [37]. This emphasizes
further that what is characteristically different in individuals
with autism is a lack of spontaneous mentalizing and/or be-
havioural adaptation and that in spite of an intact ability to
consciously reflect upon others’ mental states, patients still
have dramatic difficulties in real-time social interactions.
