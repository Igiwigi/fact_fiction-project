3 Secondary butyl nitrite when injected ranks as one of the most active of the

§ nitrites, but when thus administered its effect is less than after inhalation by some

2 5 to 6 millims. in the fall of pressure.

8 Ifthe average fall after inhalation is 43 to 53 millims., after injection it is 40 to 45;
while after injection, the return is comparatively rapid (average pressure is — 6 millims.
in 5 minutes) in spite of the fact that acceleration is usually no more than 1 to 3 per
minute. The fall after injection is slightly greater than after an equal dose of
iso-buty] nitrite.
