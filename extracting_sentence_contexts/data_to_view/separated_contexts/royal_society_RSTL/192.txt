HumPnREYs on a new Variety

Trequent instances have happened where common ewes
have had twins by ancon rams, when one exhibited the com-
plete marks and features of the ewe; the other of the ram. The contrast has been rendered singularly striking when one
short legged and one long legged lamb, produced at a birth,
have been seen sucking the dam at the same time. The facts respecting the fleeces have not been-s0 well as-
certained.. They have been judged by some_ to be finer and
heavier than those of our common breed ; by others, of a
medium fineness, but possessing more uniformity of pile on
the same, and on different sheep of this kind. I have seen
instances of their varying considerably from each other,

One case, where the young assumed the perfect likeness
of the ewe, together with a meliorated pile apparently derived
from the ram, is too interesting to be omitted.
