= Action of Alcohol upon Nitrate of Diazobenzol.

S By gradually and cautiously introducing the nitrate of diazobenzol into a moderate
5 quantity of alcohol (previously warmed to about 50* C. in order to accelerate the s0lu-
= tion), and submitting the whole to distillation in a water-bath, a yellow residue remains,
which solidifies to a crystalline mass on cooling, and dissolves readily in alkaline solu-
tions, whence it was inferred that it had the character of an acid. There was, in fact,
no difficulty in ascertaining that this body was nothing else than dinitrophenylic acid,
Possessing all the well-pronounced properties of this compound ; and to prove this most
conclusively, it was converted into the characteristic amidonitrophenylic acid. Dinitro-
phenylic acid, however, is not the only product to which this reaction gives rise ; for on
mixing the distillate with water an oily body separates, which collects upon the fluid,
especially when its specific gravity has been increased by the addition of a solution
of chloride of sodium. This oil may be removed by means of a separating funnel and
dried over chloride of calcium. It possesses, when rectified by distillation, all the pro-
perties of ordinary benzol. I have converted it into dinitrobenzol by the action of
fuming nitric acid, and haye found this latter identical with that prepared from coal-tar
