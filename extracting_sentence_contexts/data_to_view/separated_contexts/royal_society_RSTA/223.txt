The use of nanoporous alumina membranes for environmental applications has
also received recent interest. For example, Ma, B. et al. (2009) suggested the use
of nanoporous membranes for water purification. As mentioned earlier, many medical and environmental applications for
nanoporous alumina membranes are attributed to the fact that these materials
exhibit high pore densities, well-controlled and uniform pore sizes, as well as
straight pores. Transport of materials across nanoporous membranes may be
controlled by altering the membrane pore size in a controlled manner. In addition,
nanoporous materials with unusual biological and chemical properties may be
created by chemically modifying the pore surface.
