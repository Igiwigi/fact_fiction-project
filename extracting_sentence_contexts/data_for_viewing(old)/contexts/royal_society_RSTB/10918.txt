high as in other communities. Male—female friendships in sev-
eral Old World monkeys (see above) may functionally
correspond to extended mate guarding. Increased mate selec-
tivity may represent another variation on this theme [175],
but there is as of yet little evidence from primate studies sup-
porting this notion [129]. Other alternative male reproductive
tactics, including dispersal decisions, temporary influxes of
males from all-male groups, coercive or surreptitious mating
and coalition formation, have been described [176], but they
have not yet been systematically linked to variation in ASR.

(d) Adult sex ratio and female reproductive strategies
The fact that female primates and other mammals not only
compete with each other for food, but also in the context of
reproduction has only recently been fully appreciated
[1,82,85,86,177]. Sex ratios may play an important role
in this context as well because female-biased ASRs may
exacerbate this competition by increasing the number of
competitors relative to males when female mammals com-
pete directly for access to mates and paternal investment
[82,83,178]. In a solitary ground squirrel, female mating fail-
ure varied indeed predictably with changes in the colony’s
ASR: a female’s probability of breeding increased under
more male-biased OSR and it was independent of local
female density [150]. Among primates, increases in female
