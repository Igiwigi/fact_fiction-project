Patients with these numerical abnormalities have a
much less severe phenotype than comparable autosomal
abnormalities. Autosomal monosomies are embryonically
lethal in man, with trisomies of chromosomes 15, 18 and 21
being tolerated, but associated with malformation. By con-
trast, the relatively mild impact of X aneuploidies probably
reflects the fact that in humans all but one X chromosome
are inactivated, and the phenotypic abnormalities observed
in these individuals probably reflect the altered expression
of X-linked genes that normally escape X inactivation [13]. In human, it was shown that about 12-20% of genes are
expressed from the inactive X chromosome (Xi) [14]. These
genes that are believed to ‘escape’ silencing vary among tis-
sues and also among different female individuals, thus
contributing to phenotypic variability in X aneuploidies.
