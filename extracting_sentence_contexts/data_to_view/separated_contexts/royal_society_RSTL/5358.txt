And we ought to have B==cG,+eG,, to satisfy,which equation we must, manifestly
have c=4; to find (e), compare the wn <a; of #4, this gives

4[0, 3]+24[1, 2]=P[0, fo tl =FK 2]+e(3[1, 2]—[0,3]);

accordingly we ought to be able to satisfy the two equations

each of which accordingly we find is Satisfied by the equality =,
Substituting| in, the equation, for B above written, we. thus obtain

which will be found to be identically true. Art (70.). We may now ee our way to a more concise mode of obtaining the
numerical coefficients [by which they may\in fact be» computed- and-verified with
comparatively little labour], connecting the Bezoutiant with the co-bezoutiant forms of
the constituent scale. It, will not fail to have been remarked, that throughout the pre-
ceding determinations I have presumed the truth of the formulz which admits of an
immediate verification, that for all values of mz and we have the identical equation
