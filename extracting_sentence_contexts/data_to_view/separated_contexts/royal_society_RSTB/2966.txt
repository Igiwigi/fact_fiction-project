CaAtman, we have been able to examine
preserved specimens of Anaspides, and we have found traces both of a centralised
and of a peripheral system of chromatophores (Plate 23, fig. 52). Opposite
to the base of each pair of appendages and closely applied to the nerve-cord,
there is an unpaired chromatophore-centre from which long branches run up the
body-wall and down the endopod of the limb, very much as in Mysis the branches
of the neutral group of centres supply these two organs. In fact, this is the neural
group. It is centralised, segmental, and has the far reaching branches of the
Mysidee. In addition to these chromatophores, there are hexagonal plates of pigment
on the skin of the abdominal pleura, and more deeply placed pigment-masses in the
mid-dorsal line of each segment.
