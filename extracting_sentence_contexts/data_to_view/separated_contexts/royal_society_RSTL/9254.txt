PART 1L.—(THEORETICAT). SeorION V.— INTRODUCTION TO THE THEORY.

53, In 8uggesting im a former paper that the results discovered by Mr. Crookes
were due to the communication of heat from the surface of the solid bodies to the gas
surrounding them, I pointed out as the fundamental fact on which I based my explana-
tion, that when heat is communicated from a s0lid surface to a gas, the mean velocity
of the molecules which rebound from the surface must be greater as they rebound than
as they approach, and hence the momentum which these particular molecules com-
municate to the surface must be greater than it would be if the surface were at the
same temperature as the gas. So far the reasoning is incontrovertible. But in order to explain the experimental
results, it was necessary to assume that the number of cold molecules which approached
the hot surface would be the same as if the surface were at the same temperature as
the gas, or at any rate if reduced the number would not be sufficiently reduced to
counteract the effect, of increased velocity of rebound.
