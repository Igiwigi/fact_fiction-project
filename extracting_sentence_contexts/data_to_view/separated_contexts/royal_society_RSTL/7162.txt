ALTHouGn the dentition of adult individuals of the animals which constitute the
Jemarkable order, or, rather, subclass Marsupialia, has been repeatedly 8ubjected to
Bxamination, and described with exhaustive minuteness of detail, it is a singular cireum-
Itance that most, of those peculiarities of the succession of their teeth which distinguish
Shem from other mammals appear hitherto to have escaped observation. S Professor OwEN has, indeed, established the fact that, those posterior teeth of each
Hide of each jaw which have no deciduous predecessor are, as a general rule, four in
Humber, instead of three, as in most placental mammals*, and has further contributed
-Zome important obseryations upon the later stages of the dentition of one family, the
Blacropodider. Beyond this, I have not been able to find any information upon the subject. Indeed
5 is remarked by the author just mentioned, that * an interesting field of observation still
'Zemains open in regard to the period and order of development, of the deciduous and
Sermanent teeth, in the different carnivorous, omnivorous, insectivorous, and frugiyorous
Marsupials.”
= To supply this blank is the object of the present communication, Fortunately the

aterials contained in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, if not quite 80
.Somplete as might be desired, are amply sufficient to illustrate the main aspects of the
pention; and to furnish a result as interesting as it was unexpected,
