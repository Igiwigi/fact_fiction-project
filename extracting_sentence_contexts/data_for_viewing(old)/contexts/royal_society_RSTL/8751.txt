sometimes assume a faint violet tint from the hematoxylin.

As represented in figure 7, the nuclei are not uncommonly seen as if lying under the
silver line separating two adjacent cells, a part of the nucleus being on one side of the
line and part on the other.

Coming off from these vyessels, and traversing the gland in all directions, are numerous
lymphatic tubes of very varied size and shape. 'The larger ones run principally between
groups of vesicles, and are in direct communication with smaller ones which pass between
individual gland-vesicles. The latter (the © few finer canals” of Fer), in a well-injected
Specimen, are seen to be numerous, and are frequently noticed partially, and not uncom-
monly completely, surrounding the individual vesicles. As mentioned, these tubes vary
very much in 8ize and form—in fact, they appear to adapt themselves accurately to the
intervals left between the vesicles. 'This being the case, as might be expected, the dia-
meter of a tube rarely remains constant for any distance ; and where the intervals left
between the vesicles are larger, the tubes expand into lymphatic spaces having the most
irregular shape.

The lymphatic tubes, then, both large and small, together with the lymphatic spaces,
form a dense rounded network of freely anastomosing canals, which permeates the entire
substance of the thyroid gland, In no case have I 8een any indication of the lymphatics
terminating in blind extremities, and can only attribute such an appearance to an imper-
fect injection. The distinctly tubular character of the tubes, as well as the form of the
spaces and tubes generally, are best seen in specimens injected with Berlin blue (figs.
2 & 3). In perfectly injected parts of silver preparations a continuous layer of endo-
