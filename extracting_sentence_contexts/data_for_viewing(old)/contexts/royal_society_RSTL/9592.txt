facts arises from the bearing which they have on the theory of natural rhythm. My

belief is that hitherto the theory of rhythm as due to ganglia has attributed far too
much importance to the ganglionie as distinguished from the contractile tissnes, and I
have founded this belief principally on the facts which have been already stated and
which certainly prove, at least, this much : that after the removal of their centres of
spontaneity the contractile tissnes of the Meduse display a marked and persistent
tendeney to break into rhythmic action whenever they are supplied with a constant
stimulus of feeble intensity. Without waiting again to indicate how this fact tends
to 8uggest that the natural rhythm of the unmutilated organisms is probably in large
part due to that alternate process of exhaustion and restoration of excitability on the
part of the contractile tissues, whereby alone the phenomena of artificial rlythm can be
explained,* I shall go on to deseribe ome further experiments which were designed
to test the question whether the influences which affect the character of the natural
rhythm likewise, and in the same manner, affect, the character of the artificial rhythm.
T took the trouble to perform these experiments because I felt that if they should
result in answering this question in the affirmative, they would tend still further to 8ub-
stantiate the view I am endeavouring to uphold, viz. : that the natural rhythm may be
a function of the contractile as distinguished from the ganglionic tigsue. Of the
modifying causes in question, the first that I tried was temperature.
