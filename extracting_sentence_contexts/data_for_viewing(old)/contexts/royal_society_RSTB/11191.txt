these are performing their normal biological functions’ [14].
Molecular chaperones fulfil essential cellular ‘housekeeping’
and cytoprotective functions, and thereby ensure correct func-
tionality. They also enable cells to cope with the plethora
of insults and stresses that exist in the complex and dynamic
intracellular environment (table 1).

Since these early studies, a growing number of proteins that
are involved in protein folding and in the cell stress response
have been identified in all three of life’s Kingdoms. Several
families of the molecular chaperones include large numbers of
proteins. For example, the Hsp40 family contains 50 members.
The fact that the number of human molecular chaperones and
protein-folding catalysts is probably in the region of 150 proteins
underlies the enormous complexity of the cell stress response.
The cell stress protein families can be subdivided into molecular
chaperones, which aid protein folding without changing the
client protein in any way, protein-folding catalysts such as
protein disulfide isomerases, which catalyse SH-:-S-S- intercon-
versions, and peptidyl prolyl isomerases, which catalyse cis :
trans isomerization of prolines and thus induce chemical
changes in their client proteins [19]. The protein-folding cata-
lysts can also be involved in redox interactions, and this

phenomenon of oxidation and reduction both within and out-
