dimension and its fissuration tending more to transverse fissuration than in the Chinese.
Concerning the Rolandic angle (average 64째) I should not like to make any statements.

The rounder form of the frontal lobe as compared to the Chinese is evident on first
sight in all my eight specimens ; it may be more emphasised by connecting the temporal
perpendicular, where it intersects the dorsomedial edge of the brain, with the most
frontal point of the frontal lobe.

The angle thus formed with the temporal perpendicular is constantly larger in my
Japanese (average 40째) than in my Chinese brains (average 35째). The same is seen in the
three Japanese brains described by Serat (1913).

This is in harmony with the greater height of the Chinese head and with the fact,
observed by BAtz (1880), that the Japanese front tends to protrude, a feature rarely
oceurring with the Chinese, cf. HABERER (1902) and Mocut (1908). On the mesial side
the high callosum index and small stem angle (average 96째) are equally striking, as in
the Chinese.

I finish this part of my paper by showing some brains of Bataks, a people usually
considered as belonging to the Protomalay or Indonesians of Hamy (1926), together
with the people of Mentawei and Nias and the Dajaks (KLEetwe@ DE ZWAAN (1925) ).

HacGEn (1890) and V6rz (1900) pointed out that their cephalic indices show a similar
numerical relation of dolicho-, meso- and brachycephalics as the Nias people, so well
