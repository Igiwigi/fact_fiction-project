But though many skulls have been described we know
little of the anatomy except the relations of the external bones. Something is known
of the palate in half a dozen genera, and a little of the structure of the lower jaw, but
little of the occiput or of the structure of the brain-case, and very little of the dental
succession. Our ignorance of the earlier Therocephalian skull is largely due to the
fact that nearly every skull from the Tapinocephalus zone is in a matrix so hard that
satisfactory development is very difficult, and in many cases the bones are cracked
so that the tracing of sutures is hardly possible. The Therocephalians of the Tapinocephalus zone can conveniently be placed in two
groups or familiesâ€”those with two large functional upper canines, and those with
only one. In mammals with a full dentition the canine may be defined as the first
maxillary tooth ; but in many of the Therocephalians this is not so, Very frequently

the first maxillary tooth is quite small, and it is the second tooth that is the killing
tooth.
