Thus, most of the measures of non-locality (as a
special case of contextuality) reviewed in [16] cannot be naturally extended to measures of locality
(non-contextuality). The measures of contextuality constructed in relation to Bell-type criteria of
non-contextuality for consistently connected systems, as e.g. in [17], usually can be extended to
measures of non-contextuality along the lines of our opening example. The fact that we do not
discuss these measures in detail is a reflection of the focus of this paper rather than our view of
their relative importance.

2. Basics of the Contextuality-by-Default approach

2.1 A system R of random variables is a set whose elements are random variables Rf labelled in
two ways: by their contents q € Q (that which the random variable measures or responds to) and
their contexts c € C (the conditions under which this random variable is recorded):

R=(Rj:ceCqeQq~<c}, (2.1)

where q <c indicates that content q is measured (or responded to) in context c. Throughout this
paper, the set of contents Q and the set of contexts C are finite, and all random variables in the
system are Bernoulli, with values 0/1.

2.2 In CbD, with no loss of generality, one can make q < c hold true for all q and c, by placing in
every ‘empty’ (q,c)-cell a dummy variable with a single possible value [18].
