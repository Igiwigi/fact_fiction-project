extends vertically into it as together representing the allantoic primordium (text-fig. la, End. D.). Our
subsequent examination of Loris (33) has, however, thrown doubt on that interpretation and it now seems
more probable that the endodermal diverticulum represents the hind-gut, but this question can only be
decided when further material becomes available for study.

(Pl. 2, fig. 19, and text-figs. 2 and 3).

When we proceeded to work out the distribution of the allantoic (umbilical) vessels,
certain remarkable facts came to light. We found that the four branches of the
umbilical arteries (three of them accompanied by corresponding veins) which radiate
outwards from the attachment of the allantoic stalk, on the inner (coelomic) wall of
the primary sac, did not extend on to the accessory lobes at all, but on reaching the
