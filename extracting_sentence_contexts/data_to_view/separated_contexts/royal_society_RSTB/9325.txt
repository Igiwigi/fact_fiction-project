Concluding comments

In the context of the Royal Society meeting entitled ‘The para-
digm shift for UK forensic science’, this paper has explored
some of the issues faced by forensic science through the trace
evidence example and presented some possible solutions. Trace evidence is seminal to forensic science both for epistemo-
logical and historical reasons, and most of the comments
addressed towards this area are applicable to forensic science
as a whole. Despite the fact that many of these comments
may appear negative, this paper should not be seen as the
‘nail in the coffin’ of trace evidence. This is in fact quite the
opposite. It is hoped that by better understanding the chal-
lenges and their roots, the relevant community can work
collaboratively with end-users, R&D providers, educators,
policy-makers and other stakeholders towards a more effective
and more reliable use of trace evidence.
