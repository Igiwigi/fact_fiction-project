Their testimony was given freely, and was concurrent at each locality,
and equally s0 in comparing the different localities between which there was little or no
communication. Now all the workmen to whom I spoke, both at Abbeville and Amiens,
were unanimous in assuring me that the flint-implements were found in the undisturbed
gravel indiscriminately with the fossil bones. Not only did the workmen all agree on this
point, but the foremen and proprietors of the pits bore testimony to the same fact, —a
fact which to a certain extent I can now corroborate from my own experiencef.

3. Finally, we have to-consider whether it is possible for the flint-rmplements to kave
been introduced into their present position within some comparatively recent period, or
whether they are contemporaneous with the accumulation of the gravel; and further,
whether the remains of the large extinct mammals could have been derived from some
older beds, and therefore be of anterior date to the flint-implements. These implements might have got imbedded in the gravel, —lst, by artificial excava-
tions; 2ndly, by rents in the ground.
