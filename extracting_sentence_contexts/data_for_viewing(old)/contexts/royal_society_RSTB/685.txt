It has been seen that an epidermic origin for the E.M.F. of the rest current of the
Fel’s skin upon the theory of mucin-metamorphosis will not hold good, and that it is
far more probable that the explanation that the source of the E.M.F. of the current
of rest is in the preparatory processes going on in glandular structures, is the correct

_ one. If such be the case, the most simple explanation of the origin of the E.M.F. of

the current of action in the Eel’s skin is that it is simply due to an increase in the

activity of processes whose molecular changes give rise to that of the current of rest.

Most striking support is given to this explanation by the fact, evident in Experi-

ment O, that, when the E.M.F. of the rest current is reduced nearly to zero by the
action of chloroform vapour, the normal excitatory development of E.M.F. is absent,

It remains now to recapitulate a few of the more important points with reference
to the electromotive properties of the skin of the Eel dealt with in this paper :
