tions of feyer patients in a public hospital ; and many facts are incidentally
related by medical writers, and referred to other causes, which I should not
hesitate to ascribe chiefly to exposure of this nature. Not to mention indi-
vidual cases, in the sessions held at Oxford in July 1577, © there arose amidst
the people such a damp that almost all were smothered+.” Lord Bacox attri-
