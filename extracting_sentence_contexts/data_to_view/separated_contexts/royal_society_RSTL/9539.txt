With the exception, perhaps, of the oxyntic glands of the
Snake, all the glands above considered have normally nearly returned to their hungry
condition by the end of the digestive period, 2.e., at the end of twelve to twenty hours
of 8ecretion, The protoplasm which has been continuously diminishing, owing to the
continuous formation of zymogen, is hardly appreciably in less quantity than at the
beginning. The protoplasm, then, has grown during secretion. I know of nothing
D which tends to show that the growth of protoplasm is limited to any particular period
of digestion ; there are, on the other hand, several facts which go far to prove, if
indeed they do not prove, that the growth is continuous during digestion. In the second stage of digestion the cells increase in size, since we have no reason

= to imagine that the stored-up substances, the zymogen and 80 forth, occupy a greater

Z 8pace than the protoplasm from which they are formed, we may, I think, fairly refer
the greater part ab any rate of this increase in the size of the cells to a growth of the

fluid 8ecreted, the total growth of protoplaxm must be very considerable. We have seen that under certain circumstances it may happen that there is a similar
increase in the size of the cells, 1.e., a similar growth of protoplasm in the first one or
two hours of digestion ; we might then adopt a course of reasoning like that adopted |
in considering the formation of granules, and conclude that the protoplasm is growing |
also in the first stage of digestion when the cells are diminishing in 8ize.
