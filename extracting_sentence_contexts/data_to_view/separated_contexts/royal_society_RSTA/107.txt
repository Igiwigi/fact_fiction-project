It can be noted that, even if the results with
the hindcasted series are close to the average values obtained by the reconstruction, the range
of variability of the reconstruction is much wider and provides a statistically more significant
sample. Differently from permanent free spans caused by sea bottom unevenness, the evaluation of
the fatigue accumulated by an evolving free span should be calculated considering the actual
environment causing its development. In fact, as can be seen in figure 8, the main part of the
fatigue is accumulated during the last part of its life when its length is maximum and caused
