Interestingly, by comparing the
distributions across components, we observe substantial differences. We observe that, when
including holiday and weekend trips, the distributions display a bimodal shape (figure 3c). A
possible explanation for the observed bimodality lies in the fact that, when it comes to holiday
and weekend travel, certain cities act as travel bridges, because they are located along major travel
roads, and connect travellers from their home locations to their travel destinations, while other
cities act as origins or destinations of the trip. In the former, the distribution of effective distances
is extremely unbalanced, because trips occur mostly along one preferential travel axis. In the latter,
the distribution of effective distances is more even.
