Through 12 vessels of diameter 0°22 millim. the amount should be 0°68 cub. centim.
per minute. The ditference between the observed and calculated amount of flow
is due to the fact that: (1) the vessels, as already seen, are longer than is indicated
by the length of stem; (2) they are not perfectly circular in outline; (3) their
internal walls are not perfectly smooth. In any case it is evident that the
viscosity resistance in this especially favourable case is two to three times greater
than would be expected from a viscosity calculation when the vessels are completely
filled with liquid. Living wood was used for this experiment, but the viscosity of
water and mercury are so nearly alike that the presence of a molecular film of water
adhering to the inside of the moist wall could hardly affect the flow appreciably.
