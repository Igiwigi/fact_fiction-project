agrina margaritfera but not in Meleagrina anomivides, or M. vulgaris; in Solen
fonesi, Pharella orientalis and Solenocurtus philippinarum (fig. 42, p. 254), but not
in the other examples of the Solenidee examined; in Anatina flexuosa, but not in
Anatina truncata, The meaning of these enlarged apical filaments is as inscrutable
as that of the principal filaments, and no attempt at an explanation is here con-
templated.

Cilia.

Those curious isolated patches ot stiff cilia constituting the “ciliated discs” have
already been referred to (p. 154). Asa general rule they project slightly from the
anterior and posterior sides of the filament, owing to the fact that the columnar cells
bearing them are taller than the ordinary epithelial cells, e.g., Lithodomus dactylus
(fig. 3A). In certain instances, however, they are set upon definite outgrowths or
“spurs” of the filament, arising from the anterior and posterior sides, e.g., Modiola
polita (fig. 3B), or from the interlamellar edge, e.g., Spondylus nicobaricus (fig. 3C).

The other cilia of the filaments are usually arranged in vertical strips or bands,
one down the frontal surtace of the filament—the frontal cilia—and one on each of
the sides of the filament—the /ateral cilia—separated from the frontal cilia by a
narrow space. The marginal cilia of the frontal band are usually, though not
invariably, longer than the median ones, and these are known as the latero-frontal cilia.
(These terms are not employed in exactly the same sense as by Peck, whose figures
are mostly incorrect as regards arrangement of the cilia.) The disposition of the
