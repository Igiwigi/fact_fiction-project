Interestingly, the condition (C 1) translates to the fact that information cannot propagate at a speed
below the smallest discrete velocity of the lattice, and above the maximal one—this condition
is more commonly known as the (Courant, Friedrichs et Lewy) CFL condition. Similarly, the
condition (C 2) translates to the fact that the temperature is bounded by the minimal and maximal
internal energies of discrete velocities. Observing a lower limit for the temperature might be
surprising at first, but in fact, this is exactly what is observed during simulations of both DVMs
and LBMs (figures 1 and 2). Consequently, by choosing the minimal and maximal norm of discrete velocities, and by
centring the velocity discretization accordingly, researchers from the DVM community are able to
obtain stable simulations that lead to accurate results even for very large velocity and temperature
variations.
