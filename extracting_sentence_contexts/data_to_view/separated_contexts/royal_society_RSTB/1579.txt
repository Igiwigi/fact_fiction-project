â€˜3 A careful investigation of the remaining genera of the Hypostomatine may bring
en light other forms, some of which may prove to be eyen more, and others less,
Siberrant than those alread 'y known. $ We have had no opportunity of dissecting the Indian genera, Sisor, Zcostome, and

gAmesice, Some doubt has been thrown om the correctness af their presumed velation-
Sship to this group, but the mode of formation of the oaseous capsules for the air-
Bhladder, and the extent of coalescence among the anterior vertebre, should furnish
oo evidence on this point. TL is unfortunate, therefore, that the only eyidence
Zavailable through Day's descriptions is confined to the bare fact that the air-bladder
Bconsists of two lateral sacs enclosed within bony capsules, no information being
given about the special features so necessary for comparison with undoubted
Hypostomatines,
