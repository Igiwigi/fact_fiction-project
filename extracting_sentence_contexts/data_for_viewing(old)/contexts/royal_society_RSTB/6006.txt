view of the cast of Pithecanthropus is definitely blunter in appearance than that of
Sinanthropus. There is an antero-external angle placed only very little behind the
level of the most anterior point of the cast; this angle is only very faintly indicated
in the cast of Sinanthropus where the superciliary margin passes uninterruptedly into
the orbital margin. The presence of the antero-external angle in Pithecanthropus
which appears to belong to the same general mass as the postero-external angle formed
by the frontal cap gives the inferior frontal region a bolder and fuller appearance than
it has in Sinanthropus. It is as though the cortex of the frontal lobe had flowed down
over the lateral surface and become banked up along the orbital margin. The lower
end of the precentral region in Pithecanthropus is somewhat fuller and therefore it is
apparent that the changes leading to the expansion of the frontal lobe were in a slightly
more advanced stage in Pithecanthropus than in Sinanthropus. We have already
referred to the fact that the region behind the parietal eminence is also slightly fuller
in Pithecanthropus. The frontal expansions are probably the expression of the higher
motor responses to the development of the sensory areas in the parietal and post-
temporal regions. We should therefore find corresponding differences in the temporal
region. On the left side of the cast of Pithecanthropus the temporal region is practically

all missing ; but on the right side enough is preserved to allow definite conclusions to
be drawn. The anterior part of the temporal lobe below the level of the precentral
area is fuller in Pithecanthropus ; its upper border is not bevelled off and finally it is in
contact with the frontal cap at the most anterior point at which it is preserved. This
