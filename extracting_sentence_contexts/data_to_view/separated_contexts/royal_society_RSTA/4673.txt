The distance
from the centre of the thermometer K to the centre of the heating coil was 5 em.,
and the distance fiom the centre of the heating coil to the centre of the thermometer
H was 8 em., so that the alteration in the rise in temperature between the heating
coil and this thermometer in the two flows was 0째034x8/13째 C. approximately. Thus, if we assume that by the time the gas had reached H it had reattained the
temperature of the jacket, we see that the excess of the temperature of the jacket
over the mean temperature of the gas between the heating coil and H was approxi-
mately 4 (0째084) (8/13), or 001째 C. greater in the small than in the large flow. This
fact would tend to minimise the heat loss which took place when the gas became
heated by the electric current, the effect: being greater in the small than in the large
