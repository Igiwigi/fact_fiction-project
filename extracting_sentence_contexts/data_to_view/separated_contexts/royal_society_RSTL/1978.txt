For the firſt experiment T put into the glaſs ſyringe four drops

the poiſon diffolved in water ; the quantity of poiſon in the

bur drops could hardly amount to half a grain. 1 introduced

de crooked end of the ſyringe into the jugular'of a large rabbit ;

ut in the a& of puſhing in. the piſton, which was not cloſe

ough fitted to the bore of the ſyringe, the poiſon returned

Ickward, which made me fay to the perſons who were preſent,

cient quantity, as the animal was killed ; but had it not been
for that circumſtance, I ſhould have judged, from the quan=#

'The animal was ſodead, that there appeared no ſigns of reſpisll

its parts than is uſual with animals that have been long dead
The death of this animal followed ſo cloſe upon the introduftionl
of the poiſon, that the interval of time ſeemed quite inſenſible ;
it appeared to take place much quicker than in the caſe of the
poiſon of the viper, introduced into the blood mn the ſame
manner. Having repaired my ſyringe, I put into it only two drops of
the water in which I had mixed one quarter of a drop of the
poiſon diffolved in water as above. I had ſcarcely introduced
the poiſon into the jugular, when the rabbit fell down as dead
as if it had been ſtruck with lightning.
