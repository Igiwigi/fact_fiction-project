this type is recorded so early as the Carboniferous period. But whatever view may
be taken on this point, the extremes are connected by intermediate examples, and it
is no difficult matter to see that a slight modification of a pinna with circular sori, by
extension of the sori along the veins, might result in a type like Danwa, while in
Danes itself, the sori when abstricted (fig. 1) take a form very much like that normal
for Kaulfussia, The instability of form in the individual serves thus to connect the
more divergent types; it suggests that the condition in Kaulfussia, where the
numerous circular sori are spread over a large leaf-area, may have arisen by extreme
lateral extension of the wings of the pinna, accompanied by repeated abstriction of
the sori during the process, after the manner shown in Danea in fig. 1, a, b,c: signs
of such abstriction are still to be seen in Kaulfussiw as shown in fig. 81. Such
extension of sori following on the broader development of the leaf, will harmonise
with the facts stated by ZerierR (‘ Bassin Houiller et Permien d’Autun,’ pp. 23-4,
also pp. 57-8), in the case of Pecopteris densifolia (GorrrERt), Grand’ Eurya
Autunensis (Stur), and Pecopteris Platoni (GRANvD’ Evry) (Joc. cit., pp. 8 and 53, and
plate 8, fig. 7). Ifa widening of the pinnule were followed by an extension of the
sori and their final abstriction, just such difficulties in definition of the individual

sorus as he mentions in the former species would probably present themselves.

Accordingly, while admitting that the matter is not susceptible of present proof, my

own opinion is that in Danea and Kaulfussia, which are the extreme examples of
extension of leaf-area, while the leaves themselves are simply pinnate, or even
