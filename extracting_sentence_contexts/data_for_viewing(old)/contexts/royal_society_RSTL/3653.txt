110. The only views I am acquainted with, regarding the place which blood-cor-
puscles should be considered to occupy as © cells,” are those of Scawaxx, and
Vaiexrin. The former considers this corpuscle as a nucleated cell; while the latter

maintains that it is a nuclens,—the object usually termed the nucleus, being really
the nucleolus. From my own observations, it appears that, paradoxical as it may
seem, both these views admit of being established. The fact is, that at an early period
the corpusele of the blood is a mere disc, having a cavity or depression representing
the * nucleolus.” At this period the corpuscle may be called a nucleus; though it
does not seem desirable to use this term, before the formation of the cell. Subse-
quently, the outer portion of the corpuscle or disc becomes transformed into minuter
discs, which coalesce to form a membrane; and the inner portion is now the nucleus,
the entire corpuscle being a cell.

111. At « of fig. 144. is a corpuscle resembling a young corpuscle of the blood, in
which the central part was red, and the outer part pale. At «, fig. 95, is a blood-
corpuscle, the discs in the altered nucleus of which, generally speaking, bad a deeper
red, the nearer they were to the centre of the nucleus. These may serve as examples,
Showing that there is a continual re-appearance of red colouring matter, and that it
