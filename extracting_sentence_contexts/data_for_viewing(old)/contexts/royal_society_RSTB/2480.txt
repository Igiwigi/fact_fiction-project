to assume that it stands in immediate need of phosphatic manure. That conclusion,
therefore, appears to be well maintained by the new results obtained from the wheat
soils. How far we may go in the other direction in venturing to fix a limit which
shall indicate (when such is the case) that the supply of phosphatic manure is
unnecessary is a more difficult question to decide. The soils of the various super-
phosphate-manured wheat plots in Broadbalk Field, like those of the corresponding
barley plots in Hoos Field, have been abundantly or over-abundantly supplied, and
would probably grow undiminished crops for some years to come if the annual supply
of phosphatic manure ceased, nitrogen (and other materials) being supplied as usual.
Those included in our series average from ‘04 to ‘05 per cent. of citric-acid-soluble
phosphoric acid—almost identically the averages found for the various corresponding
barley soils. That this is indicative of superabundance of phosphates is evident from
the fact that another plot (not analytically examined) receiving the same dressing of
mineral manures, but receiving half as much again ot nitrogen (600 lbs. ammonium
salts per acre) has consistently yielded considerably larger crops. We seem thus in a
position to say that the limit of phosphatic sufficiency, for cereal crops, is somewhere
below °04 per cent. of citric-acid-soluble phosphoric acid, while as little as about ‘01
per cent. indicates phosphatic starvation.

The plot 2 B, continuously dunged for 50 years, gives ‘056 per cent., and is pro-
bably saturated with mineral constituents of plant food. Its yield is inferior to that
of the most liberally manured chemical plot of the field (not represented in our table),
owing, it may be supposed, to an insufficient annual supply of nitrogen in a rapidly
available form.
