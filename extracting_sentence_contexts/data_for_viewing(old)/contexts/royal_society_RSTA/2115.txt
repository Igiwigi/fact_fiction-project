In general, the compound deficiency does not vanish. Consequently, there are two possibilities a

According to (5.38), we obtain from (4.1) the compound deficiency of the Hamiltonian 1

which is caused by the interaction part, a fact which is obvious: the sum of the Hamiltonians of
the subsystems differ from the Hamiltonian of the corresponding undecomposed system.

(g) Removing semi-classical description

Up to now, the systems described in §§2 and 4 are treated semi-classically, that means, the external
exchange quantities are not connected to an interaction Hamiltonian. Thus, the external heat
exchange (4.62) and the external entropy exchange (4.63) vanish in isolated systems not by the
vanishing of an interaction Hamiltonian, but by that of the exchange propagator (4.33). This
procedure is called semi-classical, because the contact temperature (3.3) is used as a classical
quantity whose quantum-mechanical definition (4.73) was not taken into account (because it
is unknown on this level). We now remove this semi-classical description by introducing an
interaction Hamiltonian describing the partition between an undecomposed subsystem and its
