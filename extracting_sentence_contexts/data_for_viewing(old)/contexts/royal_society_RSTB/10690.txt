are based on cumulative synthesis; this is important. However,
there are limitations to the ‘knowledge-for-knowledge-sake’
agenda that need to also be accounted for.

Disease models loom large in these debates due to their fre-
quent centrality in policymaking. As Christley et al. [29] note,
models are complex assemblages built on different levels of
uncertainty; their usability is a product of the networks and dis-
courses that surround them and the functional value they
provide. This makes many scientists somewhat uncomfortable
in actively engaging the policy world—it is difficult to commu-
nicate the intricacies of models and their uncertainties,
especially when there is an expedient need for concrete facts
and information to make decisions, as during an epidemic.
Kate Jones, an expert zoonotic disease modeller from University
College London and the Zoological Society of London, high-
lighted this issue in an interview:

Models ... are [often] interpreted as the truth. They have some

kind of authority over ...people...[but] the uncertainties and

the assumptions around those models aren’t often discussed,
and [it is] actually very difficult to communicate the uncertainties
