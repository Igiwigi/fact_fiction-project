entire mass, then, although the total expansion might be very great, there would be
no local expansion at all, and therefore none of the effects in question. The expan-
ion we require is a sudden elevation of the point where the rocker comes into con-
tact with the bearer, and it is manifest that * a rapid communication with the inte-
rior” may, by suddenly withdrawing the heat from the point where it is communi-
cated, almost extinguish the requisite elevation, and thus prevent the vibrations.
This appears to be the precise reason why Professor Forsxs has failed to obtain the
numerous results described in the foregoing pages. His bearers were of such a form
that the mass of matter immediately surrounding the point of contact quickly abs-
tracted the heat communicated to that point, and thus destroyed the condition upon
which the vibrations depend. The snccess of the experiments described in this me-
moir depends on the precaution, that the abstraction of heat was prevented, to some
extent, by reducing the bearers to laminz and mere spikes; and the fact that a thin
edge gave a better tone than a thick one thus receives a full explanation. These
considerations, I think, render it clear that the cause of the superiority of lead assigned
by Professor Farapar is by no means an © oversight.” On the other hand it would
not be safe to aflirm generally, nor has it been affirmed by the philosopher last
mentioned, that the less the conducting power the greater will be the effect. In the
case of glass and earthenware the vibrations 800n come to an end, for the requisite
difference of temperature between rocker and bearer, as anticipated by Professor
Forses, s00n ceases. Perſect non-conductibility would be just as inefficacious as per-
fect conductibility, and the region of practical results lies between these two extremes.
