e;, eg) are orthogonal basis vectors in a cylindrical co-ordinate space, G = (G1, G;, Gg) in (2.7a) can


be expressed as a linear function of that basis by (Gjej)e; = Gidj1 + Grdjr + Godjg. The mean flow
field commensurate with an axisymmetric jet, has components, v = (U, V;), where (at this point)
the jet spread rate is arbitrary at € = O(1).

Following GSA, we take U to be one of the independent variables of choice; i.e. (y1,1) >

(y1,U), where r= |y7|= V3 +93. The co-ordinate surfaces U(y;,r)=const. and y; =const.
are such that VU.Vy; =0 at any fixed radial location r. Since the gradient operator shows
that e} = Vy; and VU=e,dU/dy + e,dU/dr, the choice of independent variables implies that
VU.Vy; = dU/dy; =0 in the transformed co-ordinate system. Using the fact that G(y1,1,6|x;)

the orthogonality condition and the chain rule in (y;, U) co-ordinates show that the mean flow
advection vector Xj; = (X1,X,) [in (2.7a)-(2.7c)] takes a more general form than that given by
Eq. (5.15) in GSA. Moreover, operator Do acting on G(y1,1,¢|x;@) in equation (2.72) may be
transformed to

where we have suppressed the remaining arguments in G;, Dp =iw + Ud/dy; (here, 3/dy1 =
(8/dy1)|u) and X is given by (2.8). Since dU/dr =(8r/dU)-! and the chain rule shows that
a/0U = (dr/dU)d/dr, the i=r component of (2.7a) is transformed to the following result
