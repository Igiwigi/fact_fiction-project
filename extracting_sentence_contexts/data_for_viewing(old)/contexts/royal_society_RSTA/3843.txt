whereas before there are N periods around the circle, and ,/é9 is the modal refractive index of the
fundamental waveguide mode. The field Ansatz for the helical Bloch waves can then be written
as

where Bo =kye0(1 + @22) = Bo/1 + a2? is the effective average axial propagation constant
(taking account of the fact that the light is spiralling around the axis), k is the vacuum wavevector
and b,, is the complex amplitude of the mth Bloch harmonic. Note that the azimuthal interference
pattern created by any two of the harmonics in the summation will rotate at exactly the same rate
as the fibre twist, as required.

Inserting (3.7) and (3.8) into Maxwell’s equations in cylindrical coordinates with no radial term

one then applies the standard condition that the sums of coefficients of terms with identical rates

of phase progression must each independently equal zero [20]. This leads, after some algebra, to
