The Earth system feedbacks discussed in the IPCC fifth assessment report contain substantial
uncertainties, with some estimates varying by more than an order of magnitude. In at least one
case, fire, even the sign of the feedback as well as its magnitude is uncertain. The low confidence is
also illustrated by the fact that several feedbacks have only a single estimate of their magnitude in
the IPCC report. Furthermore, while linearity of feedbacks is assumed to hold for these centennial
projections [15,22] there is some evidence of longer term variation and scenario dependence of at
least some of these feedbacks [19]. Despite the current low confidence in quantification of most of
these feedbacks, the information can still provide an initial view on the impact of the composite
effects of these Earth system feedbacks on allowable global carbon budgets.
