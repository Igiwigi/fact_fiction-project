These can generally be readily recognized, as, the Nauplii thus hatched
out are more sluggish than those of the Balanids, and remain for a longer time in the
vicinity of the parent. Fishing with the surface-net will furnish Nauplii of Balanus perforatus of the first
moult, and often of other moults, probably the whole year round at Naples, and
in late winter and in spring the sea of part of the §.W. coast of England (Plymouth),
or that around Jersey, may swarm with Cirripede larvee (Chthamalus, Balanus). In
order to obtain Nauplii of Lepas faseicularis it is, according to Witvemors-SuuM
(28), during the day time necessary to fish at some depth below the surface, as these

Nauplii perform the daily descent to depths characteristic of the pe’agic fauna as a

whole, while at night they may be obtained in vast numbers at the surface itself:

The first moult is, as a rule, speedily accomplished, as WILT :
Lepas fascicularis, in fact so speedily that in this species, as well as in Balanus
perforatus, after half an hour or so it is often difficult to find any individuals which
