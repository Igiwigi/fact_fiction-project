V. BEVAN ON THE COMBINATION OF HYDROGEN

to exist for some time, and are not liable to rapid spontaneous decomposition into the
original molecules H,O and Cl,, or into new molecules HCl and HClO. That this —
complex molecule is to some extent stable appears both from the expansion experi-
ments in damp chlorine, and from the fact that pre-insolation of damp chlorine alone
makes the subsequent combination with hydrogen more rapid (p. 101), for in these
last experiments the chlorine was darkened while hydrogen was admitted, and this
operation lasted sometimes for several minutes. Owing, however, to the difficulty of
obtaining comparable results with these experiments, all that can be said is that the
H,0, Cl, molecules can exist at any rate for several minutes, The constants Cy, Cg
cannot at present be more accurately defined, but we may suppose them both to
depend on the intensity of the light. The value for dz/dt,
