492 JOHN Z. YOUNG ON FUSED NEURONS AND SYNAPTIC

In the best preparations the surfaces of the fibres appear to be pressed closely against
each other, with no visible space between (fig. 43a, Plate 46 and figs. 48-50, Plate 47).
In many cases, however, a narrow shrinkage space appears (fig. 47, Plate 47), and the
separation of the two fibres in this way shows most clearly that they remain distinct,
and do not mingle with each other at their place of contact.

The fact that there is not complete mingling between the substances of the two
members of the synapse is also most strikingly shown by the difference in their staining
capacities. The axoplasm of the outgoing, third-order, axon is deeply basophil, and
after fixation with a protein precipitant, such as picric acid, contains a great number
of small granules (figs. 47-50, 55, Plates 47, 48). The substance of the incoming fibre,
however, hardly takes basic stains at all, and even after precipitation of the proteins
contains only a few relatively large granules. In fact the incoming fibre appears to
have a very much smaller protein content than the outgoing fibre, and much less of
the acidic material. Some comment has already been made upon the gradation in
amount of acidic material (and perhaps of total protein) which occurs along the length
of the giant fibres (Young 1937). Whatever may be the functional significance of this
gradation, it shows decisively that the substances of the two axons do not mingle at
the synapse. They are kept apart, either because they are not mixable, or, more
