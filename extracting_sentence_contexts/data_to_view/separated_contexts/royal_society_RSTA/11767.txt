Each of these six lines has the same relation to the triad ; take any
one of them, say 2. Such a set of lines as 26, 27, 5, 2, is called a “ tetrad.”

Again, from figure C, we see that the number of lines which do not cut the
tetrad 26, 27, 5, 2, is 83: the lines which do not cut are 9,10,and 13, These three
lines, however, have not all the same relation to the tetrad. The lines 9 and 10 have
cach one common line of intersection with the tetrad: in fact, the line 4 cuts the lines

26, 27, 5, 2, and 9, and the line 3 cuts the lines 26, 27, 5, 2, and 10; whereas both
the lines 8 and 4 cut the lines 26, 27, 5, 2, and 13. Such a set of lines as 26, 27, 5, 2, 9, is called a “ pentad.”

Again, from figure C, we see that there is but one line 10, which does not cut
the pentad 26, 27, 5, 2, 9. Such a set of lines as 26, 27, 5, 2, 9, 10, is called a “ hexad.”

We may summarize the last results by saying that the number of the lines of the
surface which do not cut—
