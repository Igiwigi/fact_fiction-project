Illumination pattern design for hexSIM. (a) The locations of the three illumination beams (red stars) and the seven
spatial frequencies from the illumination pattern (blue spots) relative to the illumination pupil (grey circle). (6) Simulated
illumination pattern for hexSIM. (c) Potential light-sheet-based illumination scheme for hexSIM. (Online version in colour.)

fewer than the nine raw images required by conventional 2D-SIM, making it attractive for high-
speed imaging. Another attractive feature is that the illumination pattern (or its generating beams)
does not need to be rotated in order to achieve near isotropic resolution improvement. In fact,
altering the phase of just two of the beams is enough to move the pattern laterally and arbitrarily
in the sample plane. While with an epi-illumination set-up, the lateral resolution improvement of hexSIM is limited
to only approximately 1.87, this limitation can be overcome by delivering the illumination beams
as light sheets (figure 1c), where the illumination numerical aperture (NA) is now decoupled from
the detection NA. We envisage that such a light-sheet illumination set-up may be achieved with
a photonic-chip-based system similar to that reported in [38], where three mutually coherent and
overlaying light sheets are generated with on-chip optics, and the hexagonal interference pattern
can be shifted laterally by shifting the phases of two of the three light sheets.
