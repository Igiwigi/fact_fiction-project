Fav, who has examined with care their structure and development, confirms the
statements of Dr Bary and Russow. If the central cylinder of Osmunda be regarded
as reduced polystelic with the foliar gaps very much narrowed and the internal
phloem degenerate, it is possible to understand the presence of the peculiar bays ot
phloem between the strands of xylem, A further peculiarity of Osmunda and Todea,
in addition to the one just discussed, is the concentric nature of the foliar strands. There are now recorded a number of striking examples of conservatism in the foliar
strands of vascular plants, and it seems reasonable, especially in view of the facts
