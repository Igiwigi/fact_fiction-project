The determination of Z for given value of y involves that of » and e, and these can
only be found from an approximate preliminary solution of the whole problem. But
when Z is known approximately, the solution of (39) is very simple, for we first
neglect the terms in «* and «" on the right-hand side, and so determine a first
approximation to «’. As a fact I have not included the term in «” in my computa-
tions, because it would not make so much as 1’ difference in the value of cos™! «’. For Rocur’s problem when ¢ and 7 are neglected the solution is very short, but
when these terms are included the computation is laborious. We now turn to the determination of the radius vector.
