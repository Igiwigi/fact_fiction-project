But I cannot find any
evidence in the ordinary growth of the disk, that the sarcode extends itself over the
surface of the portion previously formed ; although occasional appearances will be
hereafter described (4 53), that seem to indicate that it may do 80. 21. It is a fact of much importance in the due appreciation of the relations of
Orbitolite and its allied forms to other tribes of Foraminifera, that the calcareous
partition which separates each cell of any one zone from its neighbours on either
side, is not double, but single. And this is in great part the case, even with regard
to the partitions that separate the cells of successive zones ; the inner or central
boundary of one being chiefly formed by the peripheral wall of the other. It is not
easy even in thin sections to distinguish the boundary between the walls of one zone
and those of another, s0 absolutely continuous do they appear to be.
