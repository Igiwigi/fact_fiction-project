tory that we required no further proofs of the truth of our
former observations.

Before we concluded our experiments, every mode that
could be devised was put in practice to see how far there might
be any deception ; the eye was moved upon its axis, and in
different directions, but these motions did not give at all simi-
lar appearances to those seen in the adjusting of the eye to
different distances.

From the different experiments which I have had the ho-
nour to lay before this learned Society, I shall consider the
following facts to have been ascertained.

15t, That the eye has a power of adjusting itself to different
distances when deprived of the crystalline lens; and therefore
the fibrous and laminated structure of that lens is not in-
tended to alter its form, but to prevent reflections in the pas-
sage of the rays through the surfaces of media of different
densities, and to correct spherical aberration.

2d, That the cornea is made up of lamine; that it is elas-
tic, and when stretched, is capable of being elongated 7+ part
of its diameter, contracting to its former length immediately
upon being left to itself.
