the long-term trend nor the long-term mean of either area or volume allow us to substantially
reduce the uncertainty as to when the Arctic Ocean might become free of sea ice in summer
based on the rejection of individual models from the ensemble. Not only is the link between
the past and the future evolution of these observables often not clear, their temporal and spatial
variability is additionally too large to allow us to reject a significant number of model simulations
as unreasonable.

Such a large internal variability of an observable has sometimes counterintuitive implications
regarding model quality. For example, it is usually not possible to use such an observable to


draw firm conclusions regarding a possible improvement in model quality for CMIP5 simulations
relative to CMIP3 simulations: the fact that, in our case, the CMIP5 ensemble more closely matches
the observed trend and observed mean of sea-ice area and sea ice volume compared with CMIP3
simulations [14] could, at least in principle, also indicate an on average worse quality of our
models: if the observed sea-ice evolution over the past decades forms an extremely unlikely
realization for the given atmospheric forcing, one would expect the real evolution of the sea-
ice cover to only show up in but very few simulations. It is hence by no means a desirable aim to
have the real state of the climate system lie roughly in the center of any model ensemble, nor is it
an indication of a particularly realistic model ensemble if this is achieved.

While the severe difficulties in narrowing down projection ranges through the rejection of
individual models have here only been examined for sea ice, our findings are generally true
for any metric for which the observational period is too short to robustly remove the impact
