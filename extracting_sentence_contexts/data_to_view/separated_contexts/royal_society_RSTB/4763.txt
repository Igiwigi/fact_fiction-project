That this effect is scarcely visible on the unmanured plot, and still less so
on plot 5, speaks strongly in favour of Sir Joun Lawesâ€™s view that the damage done
by winter rain was principally occasioned by the washing out of nitrates from the soil. Plot (3 and 4) and especially plot 5 can have little to lose in this way, and possibly rely
for the greater part of their growth upon nitrates produced by bacterial activity as the
soil grows warmer in March, April and May. The same view is confirmed by the fact
that among the remaining plots the loss due to winter rain is least in plots 28, 10 and 11,
all of which are characterised by the low proportion utilised of the nitrogen supplied.


126 MR R. A, FISHER ON THE INFLUENCE OF RAINFALL

If these plots seldom suffer from lack of nitrogen, its loss during the winter must be
expected to affect the crop relatively little ; nevertheless the actual average loss of
about one bushel to the inch of rain shows that at this time (j.e., before the spring
dressings are applied to plots 10 and 11, and perhaps before bacterial activity can fully
tap the resources of the farmyard manure), a temporary shortage sometimes injures the
crop. With these preliminary observations we may pass to the consideration of the types
of rainfall response curve actually found.
