(6 inches), therefore, measured off upon the roof of the type skull, should give the
position of a line beyond which the cribriform plate certainly did not extend anteriorly.
From the point thus defined to the anterior edge of the presphenoid is a distance of
1:75 inch, which must therefore represent the maximum length which the cribriform
plate could have attained. The distance from the anterior edge of the presphenoid to
the level of the posterior margins of the occipital condyles is 4:5 inches. 'The cribriform
plate is rather shorter in proportion to the base of the skull in the Glyptodon than in
> the ordinary Armadillos, and its anterior part is situated far further back in relation to
the antorbital processes.

The proper cranial cavity, or brain-case, is 8mall when compared with the whole size
of the 8kull, if the chambers.which lodge the olfactory bulbs are left out of considera-
tion. Tt is in fact only 45 inches long,.2'5 inches wide at widest, and about 1% inch
high at highest. Tts greatest width is situated beneath the occipital ridge, whence it
narrows towards. the olfactory outlet, which is about 1-25 inch wide. The immediate
side walls and roof of the fore part of the cranial cavity are formed by a very thin inner
: table of bone,.separated by a.wide air-chamber from the denser and stouter outer table.
This air-chamber does not appear to extend back beyond a transverse line connecting
the two glenoidal facets.

Mr. FLower has obtained a cast of the cranial cavity, from which one is enabled to
form an idea of the shape and size of the brain. The proportionally large cerebellum
exhibits a prominent yermiform process, and is completely uncovered above by the
cerebral hemispheres. "The latter are quite 8mooth, and their upper contour is much
arched, while their sides are flattened, and approach one- another anteriorly. 'The
