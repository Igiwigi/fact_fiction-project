no change in the alveolar CO, pressure during the exertion, or after it. The exertion
-was insufficient to produce shortage of oxygen in either the contracting muscles or
the respiratory centre. Consequently the alveolar CO, pressure remained about

normal. Only in the case of HALDANE was there an appreciable fall in the alveolar
CO, pressure, the rate of walking having been somewhat too fast in his case to allow of
a completely normal oxygen supply to the body.

From the foregoing sets of experiments it is clear that the excessive hyperpncea on
exertion at high altitudes is due firstly to the fact that the normal level of alveolar
CO, pressure is greatly lowered. On Pike’s Peak this lowering implied an increase of
about 50 per cent. in the volume of air breathed per unit mass of CO, produced in the
body. During hard muscular work the alveolar CO, pressure is still further lowered,
however, in consequence of deficient aeration of the arterial blood with oxygen. The
net result on Pike’s Peak was that during fairly hard work the alveolar CO, pressure
was about 20 mm. of mercury, instead of about 45 mm. with corresponding work at sea-
level. In other words the lung ventilation required to be about 2+ times as great for
a given elimination of CO,. This is not all, however, for the rapid lowering of the
CO, pressure during the work necessitated the washing out of a large quantity of pre-
formed CO, from the body. During this process, as has been shown, the respiratory
quotient rises to 1°2 or 1°3. This implies a further temporary increase of about
30 per cent. in the lung-ventilation per unit of work done, or of oxygen absorbed, so
