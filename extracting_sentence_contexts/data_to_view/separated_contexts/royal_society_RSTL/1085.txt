The oxide of tin (wood tin) is, yery little inferior to tin
in specific gravity... In this instance, the metallic base is comparatively light, aad the
attraction for oxygene strong; and.in a case when the metal is much lighter and the

attraction for oxygene stronger, it might. be expected a priori that the oxide would-be
heavier than the base,

of the metals without the aid of a new combination, we may
expect that this result will be afforded by the most volatile
and oxidable, such as arsenic, or the metals of the fixed
alkalies, submitted to intense heat, under electrical polarities,
and having the pressure of the atmosphere removed. Whatever new lights new discoveries may throw upon
this subject, still the facts that have been advanced, shew that
a step nearer at least has been attained towards the true
knowledge of the nature of the alkalies and the earths.*

* Since the facts in this Paper were communicated to the Royal Society, I have
Seen an account of some very curious experiments of M.M. Gar Lussac, and
TrzNxard, (in Number 148 of the Moniteur, for 1808, which I have just received,)
from one of which they have concluded, « that potassium may be/a compound of
hydrogene and potash.”

These gentlemen are said to have heated potassium in ammonia, and found that
the ammonia was absorbed, and that hydrogene gas equal to two-thirds of its
volume appeared, and that the potassium by this process had become of a grayish-
green colour. By heating this grayish-green substance considerably, two-fift!:s of the
ammonia were again emitted, with a quantity of hydrogene and nitrog2ne correspond=-
ing to one-fifth more, and by adding water to the mixture, and heating it very strongly
again, they obtained the remainder of the ammonia, and nothing but potash was left.
