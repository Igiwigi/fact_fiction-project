to effect the same purpose, which one might presume would be instinctively analogous
to those by means of which the foetus was originally applied to the nipple.

With respect to the first point, I was aware that the Hunterian dissections as ex-
hibited in the preparations in the Museum of the College, and the obseryations of
Mr. Moncax * and Mr. Corrs +, concurred in disproving the theory of a vascular
mode of connexion between the mammary foetus and the nipple ; nevertheless, as a
discharge of blood had been stated by Georeroy ST. HiLatms to accompany marsupial
birth, or the spontaneous detachment of the foetus from the nipple F, and even the
anastomoses and distribution of the continuous vessels in the neck of the foetus had
