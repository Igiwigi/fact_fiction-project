if is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. These Euler-Lagrange
conditions can also be interpreted in terms of game theory [70-72]. In fact, they imply that the
potential y achieves its global minima on the support of j, and therefore jz is also characterized as

In game theory, the probability measure ju is interpreted as the strategy chosen by the agent x, the
potential is interpreted as encoding the interactions between the agents, and the minimization
is thought about the optimal condition (the game) that the agents are looking for. Therefore, the
Euler-Lagrange conditions are interpreted in game theory as the lack of interest of any player
in the game to a change of strategy leading to the concept of Nash equilibria.
