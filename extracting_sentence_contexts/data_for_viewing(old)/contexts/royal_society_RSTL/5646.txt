Plate VII. fig. 3 represents one half of the outer ephippium magnified 250 times, and
only partly finisghed. It consists of small angular cells, about 000125 in diameter, gra-
dually passing, near the centre of the hollow which is to contain the egg, into small round
pit-like cells.

The inner ephippium (Plate VII. fig. 2) is very similar. The lower side margins consist
of a plain membrane, in which angular cells gradually become visible: round the central
protuberances these cells become elongated, but on the surface of the protuberance
regain their first $hape. A dotted membrane is also evident here.

I have not succeeded in either obtaining ephippial eggs from isolated specimens, or in
clearly proving that these eggs require impregnation, and the facts bearing on this $ub-
Ject may be summed up as follows. In the first place, the common eggs of D. Schafferi,

which T have in this paper called © agamic,” certainly do not require to be fertilized in
the ordinary manner; and as these two sorts of eggs only, 7. e. the agamic and the ephip-
pial, are produced when the males are tolerably numerous, and may often be observed in
coitu, it follows either that impregnation is necessary for the ephippial eggs, or, which in
the present state of our knowledge seems less probable, that one or both sorts of eggs
