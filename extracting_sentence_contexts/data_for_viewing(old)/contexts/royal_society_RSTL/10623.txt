by General Mont. In this case it was used to perform the operation [Fds, where F was
the force of traction measured by a spring, ds being the increment of space passed over
at that instant by the cart. Tt was 800n afterwards employed by Professor MosgLey
in a © constant s8team engine indicator” designed for the use of a committee. of the
British Ass0ciation.* In this instrument the disk was replaced by a cone, and F was
the varying pressure of steam in the cylinder. Since then the disk and roller
principle has been adopted by many inventors for purposes of integration in con-
junetion with dynamometers for measuring the power transmitted from a prime mover
or to a machine. The cone and roller principle was employed by Professor MosELEY
in a calculating machine,+ and by SANG and others as a Platometer or Planimeter.
Messrs. A8HTON and STory have revived the application of the disk and roller to a
continuous Indicator, which should, however, really be called a steam-power Integrator.
In the last-named instrument advantage is taken of the fact that as the steam
pressure acts alternately on one 8ide or the other of the piston, the roller may be
made to take a corresponding position on either side of the centre of the disk, thus
both the forward and backward stroke of the engine combine to effect the continuous
rotation of the roller in one direction, and thereby integrate the total work done.

All the foregoing examples are applications of the disk and roller mechanism for
purposes of integration. Differentiation may practically be effected by means of the
disk and roller in the following manner :—In fig. 1 leb G represent the disk, and B
the movable roller. Instead of the roller B being fixed to its axis the latter is a
crew (K E) of which B forms the nut. For convenience the disk is snpposed to be
driven from the hollow shaft F by means of the roller A, which is always ab a
constant distance from the centre of the disk, and may be therefore alluded to as
