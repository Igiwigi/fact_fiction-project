that drive structure formation do not involve dissipation, but, when dissipation is computed, its
statistical distribution in space measured in the inertial range is a direct response to the statistical
distribution of the structures. A simple picture emerges, in which, for large driven systems, it is
possible to achieve balance between ideal structure formation and structure deterioration owing
to non-ideal effects. In that case one finds a steady transfer through inertial range scales, balanced
by intermittent dissipation at small scales.

4. Dynamical relaxation, cellularization and intermittency

The multiplicity of variables, conservation laws and other parameters in incompressible MHD : =

for a kinetic plasma. Multiplicity of variables and parameters also makes it difficult to envision [3

turbulence that extends beyond hydrodynamic antecedents. : 3
The role of advection in generation of intermittency seems fairly clear based on the several : 3
examples discussed in the prior section. The pile-up of gradients also requires a region of :3

slowdown or diversion so that the transported quantity may be concentrated. For hydrodynamic
shear layers, this role is evidently provided at least in part by stagnation points or layers, where
vortex amplification into sheets or tubes is likely to occur. For MHD there are more possibilities,
as the magnetic field also provides a direction of transport of various quantities, including energy.
Therefore, stagnation points of the magnetic field, or neutral points (including component neutral
