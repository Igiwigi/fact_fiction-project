But in this treatment
the distinction between photosphere and absorbing layer disappears ; each shades con-
tinuously into the other; the absorption coefficient of the material no longer appears
explicitly, and the law of darkening of the integrated radiation is free from all
arbitrary constants whatever. Further, as has been shown, it is a straightforward
deduction from SchWARzSCHILD’s theory that for the darkening in the separate colours
a single quantity alone requires to be determined—the effective temperature. Tt is remarkable that a theory so simple, so logical and showing such general
accordance with the facts should have sprung to birth with such completeness. Its
beauty is best realised when we contrast it with a paper such as that of Oprk (‘ Ast. Nach.,’ 198, p. 49, 1914), which, clearly written in ignorance of ScHwARzSCHILD’s work,
gropes complicatedly in the same direction.
