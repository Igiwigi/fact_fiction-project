Analysis and mathematics only take us so far. We have to judge how best to make certainty out of
uncertainty. These two functions of applied science and judgement can variously be described as the
known and the supposed, the factual and the conjectural, the deductive and the intuitive, the rational
and the instinctive. The third element is equally important. We are required to act in the public interest and must
therefore live up to high ethical and professional standards.
