It has been found necessary to disregard very weak absorption bands at 1350 cm=! in
n-butane and at 1307 and 1293 cm~! in n-hexane in order to obtain a regular scheme
(Axford & Rank 1949, 1950). Further infra-red work to check the solid-state spectra of
the smaller molecules in this region would probably provide the best test of the validity of
the distributions proposed, and might also locate the lower limit of the CH, twisting modes. PROPANE, N-BUTANE AND 2-PENTANE

The fact that the series selected for the skeletal, methyl rocking and CH, modes fit
smoothly into the spectra of the earlier members of the set of n-paraffins allows us to
review, and where necessary to amend, the existing assignments for these molecules with
confidence. Further, it is possible to extend the detailed interpretation of the solid-state
spectra as far as n-pentane for which there has been no previous assignment. INFRA-RED AND RAMAN SPECTRA OF THE n-PARAFFINS 55
(a) Propane

The assignment of the fundamental vibrational frequencies of propane has recently been
reviewed (Sheppard & Simpson 1953).
