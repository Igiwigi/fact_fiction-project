Let us consider the integral

[[(6)—vas
If V is a function which is symmetrical round the axis of 2 we may write this
2n[p""Vds
where ds is an element of are of any section of the sphere of reference containing the

axis of 2, and p*+2*=R?. Now the expression (5) gives the form of solution in this case. If we put

v=I "(+jp cos "dy

we have, in fact,

32 Ly {2 12 mS+n bs £ F,
(ſa=w=P.d8=amn inn X[(2+7) (Hip con Words

Expanding the quantities under the integral sign, and performing the differentia-
tions and integrations, we obtain

2m*R?2m!i2n! 22m+2gp +7111!
