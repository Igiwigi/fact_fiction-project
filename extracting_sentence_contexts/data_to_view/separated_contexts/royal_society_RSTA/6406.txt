The argument of the article is based on a particular interpretation of quantum phenomena
and quantum theory, specifically QM and QFT. This article will only be concerned with QM and
QFT in their currently standard forms, and will only mention alternative quantum theories, such
as Bohmian mechanics, in passing. Quantum phenomena will be assumed to be defined by the
fact that in considering them the Planck constant, i, must be taken into account.! The present
interpretation follows Bohr’s ultimate interpretation, developed by Bohr in the late 1930s and
based, in addition to complementarity, introduced in 1927, on a new concept, that of (quantum)
phenomenon. Both interpretations belong to the class of interpretations based on the concept
of reality without realism (RWR) and designated here as RWR interpretations.” In accordance
with this concept, these interpretations place the emergence of quantum phenomena beyond
representation and knowledge or even conception, to be designated as respectively weak and
strong RWR interpretations.
