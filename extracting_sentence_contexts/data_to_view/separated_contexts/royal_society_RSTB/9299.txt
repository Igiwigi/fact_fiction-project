Although there now appears to be common ground on
the basic principles between the scientific and legal commu-
nities, they are not always easy to apply in practice. There
is, for example, disagreement on whether reliance can be
placed on unpublished research.'! This is likely to be a
more acute problem in England and Wales given the fact
that much research is done by competitors; develop-
ments are not published and statistical databases may not
be consolidated. A judge also must always guard against the dangers
inherent in any institutional consensus where old ideas are
challenged or new ideas are advanced. The role of the
judge in this respect is difficult and must proceed upon the
confidence that a judge can place on the individual scientist
challenging the established view.

(b) The role of the scientific community and a regulator
Although the judge has the role of gatekeeper at the court,
there is an essential task to be performed by the scientific
community in being prepared to validate the reliability of
the underlying science.’

There are many ways for this to be done—through a more
systematized approach to validation of underlying science by
an established scientific body such as this Society or by a
newly created transnational body.
