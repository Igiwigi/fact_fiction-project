Although the Zoantharia tabulata are as numerous in the existing coral-faunas as
they were in the Paleozoic (and some of the genera are closely allied), the presumed
fact of the restriction of the Rugosa to the Palzozoic formations tempted many to come
to the erroneous conclusion respecting the break in the continuity of coral life at the
end of the Permian age. The characteristic nature of the Paleozoic coral-fauna was, moreover, strengthened in
the minds of some by the able manner in which MM. Mi1xe-Epwarns and Jules Hang
overthrew the old classification of the corals of 'the Muschelkalk and St. Cassian strata
of the Trias, and proved that they were not of Palzozoic genera. Strengthened by the
opinions of many geologists respecting the limitation of life, a number of able palzon-
tologists have persisted in refusing credence to any facts which should prove, if they
were no longer called anomalies, that the Rugosa were not restricted to the Palzozoic

which restricts the Rugosa to the Palzozoic rocks had studied the great work of the di-
stinguished French zoophytologists 80 often mentioned by me, they would have found that
