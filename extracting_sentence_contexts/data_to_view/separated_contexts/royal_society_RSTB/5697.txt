If this explanation of the displacement of I, is correct, the displacement must be
expected to have been less when only a small part of the presumptive stipular area of I,
was left on the apex than when a larger part was left. On the whole, this was found to
be so, as far as could be judged, as can be seen from Table II, though unfortunately it
was not found possible to measure the displacements exactly, and often their amounts
could not even be roughly estimated, for the reason explained in section (4). Moreover,
the correlation is obscured by the fact that the I, primordia were at slightly different
stages of development : for since the displacements of the second primordium were less
when P, was isolated, it must be expected that in the isolations of I, the displacements
would be rather less when I, was rather older and therefore nearer to the stage of P,. It was indeed found that in the isolations of P, the displacements were actually less
when P, was older. In the isolations of P,, the cuts were intentionally made sometimes rather close to
the central part of that primordium, and sometimes rather far from it and closer to the
growing-point, so that the isolations fell into two groups.
