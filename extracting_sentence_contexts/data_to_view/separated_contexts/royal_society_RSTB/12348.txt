Keywords: 1. Predication: a configurational definition

syntax, semantics, neurolinguistics, Predication is a prototypical compositional notion since it is defined by the
clause structure, cartography, predication combination of two distinct and diverse elements, a subject and a predicate,

in the proper configuration. The term ‘composition’ is obviously pervasive in

science for it refers to the generation of a novel structure by assembling smaller

parts but, in fact, the term was originally used in linguistics; etymologically,

composition derives from the Latin translation of the Ancient Greek term

ina sequence." The term ‘configuration’, instead, refers to the fact that syntactic
relations cannot be represented on a single linear dimension despite the fact
that the physical stimulus is indeed linear: they require at least two dimensions
which are normally represented as graphs on a plane (see [2]). This is very easy
to detect but it is often neglected. To illustrate the configurational properties of
syntax, a simple sentence like The war which destroyed these countries was not
unexpected is sufficient.
