In two instances
out of fifteen experiments made on this point, however, there was no fall recorded
on the peripheral trace. It is therefore clear that the initial fall in the central blood
pressure, is certainly not a vaso-motor phenomenon, a conclusion already arrived at on
page 234 from other considerations, and to which latter may be now added the fact
that the effect is produced within the brief period of time required for a single reflex
act, and not a period sufticient for an excitation of the vaso-motor centre to evidence
itself by its usual curve of reaction.

(3.) That the ratio between the central, 7.c., cardiac blood-pressure and the pressure
observed in the femoral arterioles is little altered by the effect of the shot, and the
figures obtained show only the fact that the cardiac or arterial trunk pressure is
lowered before the peripheral. The average ratios obtained are as follows :—
