Thus the appearance, to me, of the green division of the diagram corresponds exactly
with that of the red or opposite one. First, I find one particular hue (full green to the
normal-eyed), which to me is entirely neutral and colourless, and visible only as a dark
grey ; secondly, all the greens on the blue side of this neutral are represented to me by
shades of blue, and can be matched to my eye by blue plus black ; and thirdly, all the
greens on the yellow side are simply shades of yellow, and can be perfectly imitated by
darkening this colour. IT am, in fact, as totally blind to green as to red; an element of
the malady which, I think, has not hitherto received the attention it deserves.

16. But here a curious question arises, whether these two kinds of blindness have any
connexion with each other? We have seen that insensibility to red induces also a want
of perception of its compounds, orange and violet ; but can this in any way affect the
vision of green, a colour into which red can scarcely be supposed to enter ?
