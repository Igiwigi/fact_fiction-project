It is in some ways similar to the tree-width, introduced in [21]. The tree-width captures
essentially how tree-like the graph is. This is useful for finding algorithms for problems on graphs
of bounded tree-width, motivated by the fact that many graph problems are easy on trees. More
on algorithms for problems on graphs of bounded tree-width can be found in [22]. Rank-width,


compared to tree-width, captures a larger class of graphs with similar complexity.
