ference of two portions of light cannot be questioned ; though it does not,
appear how these interfering pencils are generated. If we adopt the hypothesis
of the reflecting forces shown in Fig. 4, we may conceive the light reflected
about CD to be interfered with by the light reflected about C'T)', so that the
same effect nearly might be produced as if CD, C'D' were the limits of a thin
plate. If this supposition is not admissible, we may hazard the conjecture,
countenanced by some facts which will presently be stated, that an invisible
film differing in refractive power from the plate glass, has been formed upon
its surface.

There is one phznomenon which has been more than once mentioned, and
which requires some further notice ; namely, the decrease in the intensity of
the pencil as the incidence becomes more oblique, In re-examining this yery
perplexing fact, which takes place in the prism B though it does not produce
periodical colours, I have observed at a great incidence a distinct change of
colour, from a bluish gray to a blue; s0 that I have no doubt that in this case
the tints are those of a long period approaching slowly to its minimum. This
consideration led me to suppose that in the case of balsam of capivi and other
fluids, where the first order ends at and below 65Â®, there might be another
