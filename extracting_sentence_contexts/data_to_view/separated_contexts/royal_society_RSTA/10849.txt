case, the brightness shades off across individual crystals, sometimes uniformly, so as to
give the crystal a concave appearance ; at other times in patches, giving a mottled
effect. On closer inspection, it appears that such variations in brightness occur only
in one direction in each crystal; in that direction the brightness may be made to
move across the erystal by a slight oscillation of the plate, but another direction can
generally be found where the crystal appears uniformly bright and is quite free from
the concave appearance. Tt is well known that the usual selective effect of oblique illumination on etched
crystalline surfaces is due to the fact that etching develops on the surfaces of
crystals a great number of minute but similarly oriented facets or pits, and the
uniformity of illumination over any area is a direct result of the constancy of
orientation of these pits over that area. In the specimens of tin-plate here described
we would therefore expect to find that the orientation of the etched pits or facets
was not strictly constant over the entire area of each grain. By examining the etched surface of tin-plate under the higher powers of the
microscope the etched pits or facets can be clearly resolved.
