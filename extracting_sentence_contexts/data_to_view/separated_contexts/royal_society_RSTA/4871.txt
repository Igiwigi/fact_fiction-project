The film being thin and weak,
compared to the plates, nearly the whole of the resulting strain is borne by it. Consequently, any change in condenser capacity observed on heating will be due
either to the direct effect of temperature change in altering dimensions or dielectric
constant, or to the stresses thereby set up. We will assume the former alternative
and see to what results it leads,

The facts are, that when the sulphur is heated, say from 20° C. to 70° C., the mica
standard and resistance boxes being at constant temperature, no change in the
balance is observed ; for instance, it remains steady at 2463 x 107° microfarad within
one figure in the last place. 624

The temperature coefficient of specific inductive capacity, which would be required
to compensate for the alteration of capacity, computed from the variation of the
various dimensions with temperature, is
