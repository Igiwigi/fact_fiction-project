= Anew method of writing the vertebral formula of Birds is adopted (pp. 78, 81,
Q and 83).

7. The Sternum and Ribs.

In Stage E the sternum is nearly horizontal in position ; only two sternal ribs are
attached to it by joints, and a third by indifferent tissue; and it does not extend
caudad of the attachment of the third (p. 87; Plate 16, fig. 216). In Stage F
three ribs are united to it by joints, and a fourth by fibrous tissue (p. 87; Plate 16,
fig. 217). In Stage G there is the normal number of four sternal ribs in connection
with the sternum. These facts seem to show that the costal sternum does not
originate by the union of the ventral ends of all four sternal ribs, but that it extends
backwards independently of the third and fourth ribs; meeting them in turn and
becoming united with them by joints.

114 PROFESSOR T. J. PARKER ON THE ANATOMY

In some adult specimens the sternum bears a low median ridge, probably to be
looked upon as a vestigial keel (p. 86; Plate 16, figs. 210, 211, and 218).
The form of the adult sternum is very variable (Plate 16, figs. 208-215).
