ization exists in the nearly allied tribe of the Corallidz, and that from the bases of
the minute polyps, the chyliferous juices should be dispersed in eyery direction through
the common mass of the stony body of the animal, and that the usnal processes of the
absorption and reproduction of parts should take place within their calcareous axes,
as in the corresponding parts in the higher tribes of animals.

The structures which I have described are in other respects exceedingly interest-
ing, as they establish a degree of organic connection between the Corallida and the
Spongiadze, which had not, I believe, before been suspected to exist, and at the same
time have a tendency to confirm the idea of the animal nature of the latter. What-
ever doubts may have existed at former periods in the minds of naturalists respecting
the nature of the siliceous spicula of the sponge tribe, the fact of having found these
curious organs $0 exactly similar in every respect amid the undoubted animal secre-
tions of the Corallidz, will stamp them as true animal productions. The vascular
tissue with cazcoid appendages has a striking resemblance to that which I have de-
scribed in Part I. vol. i. of the Transactions of the Microscopical Society, as found
upon the fibres of one of the species of the sponges of commerce; and in the fleshy
portions of Tethea lyncurium and Geodia Zetlandica, LAMaRCK, we find fleshy mem-
branes, with minute vessels meandering through their substance in eyery direction,
80 closely resembling those obtained from the coral tribe, as to establish a degree of
affinity between the Corallidze and Spongiadz 80 intimate as to appear to place the
animal nature of the latter beyond a reasonable doubt. These tissues are in a like
manner common to Nullipora. How far this may be the case with other apolypous
corals remains yet to be proved; but should the same structures prevail in these as in
