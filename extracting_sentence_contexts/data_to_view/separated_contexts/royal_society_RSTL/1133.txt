manner, we shall find, also, that three atoms of chlorine are
adequate to conyert one atom of carbonic oxide into carbonic
acid. The facts which have been stated sulficiently prove, that
chlorine cannot be employed as a means of correctly analyz-
ing mixtures of olefiant gas, either with hydrogen or with
carburetted hydrogen, if light be admitted, even though of
feeble intensity, and for the short interval during which such
an experiment may be expected to continue : and they ex-
plain that uncertainty as to the results of analyses of mixed
gases made in this way, which was first remarked by Mr.
Farapar® and subsequently by myself. F Chlorine becomes,
however, a most useful agent in separating olefiant gas from
such mixtures, provided light be entirely excluded during
its operation, as I have found by subjecting to its action,
mixtures of those gases with known proportions of olefiant
gas. In these analytical experiments, I admitted into a gra-
duated tube standing over water, a volume of chlorine ex-
ceeding by about one.
