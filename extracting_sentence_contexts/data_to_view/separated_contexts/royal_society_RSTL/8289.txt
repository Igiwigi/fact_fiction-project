I do not attempt a general
investigation, but confine myself to showing in what manner the reductions arise,


OF ELLIPTICO FUNCTIONS. 405

12. I will first consider the cubic transformation ; here, writing for convenience
Fn the equations give

kg? 31

i= that is, PF(+2)—(2+1)=0,

and
kf=Q;

the equation in 0 gives (#0'—1)—4#(1*f—1)*=0, and we have thence
k(Q*—1Y—40Q(4N—1)*=0,
kQ'—4PQ*+64Q?—4Q +k=0,
the modular equation ; and then F9'—1+20(7*f—1)=0, that is, Q*—1 +20(4Q—1)=0,
or 20= SL, which is = = say we have «=Q*—1, Þ=2(1—kQ); consequently

that is

1=y__l-z (Q*-1+2(4Q—1)a)*
1+y 1+z ]Q?-1-2(40—1)aſ?

1 __a*+2a8 0+2 N*—4kN+3
a=Q*, and HEE ET MH,

which completes the theory.

13. Reproducing for this case the general theory, it appears & priori that Q is deter-
mined by a quartic equation; in fact from the original equations eliminating Q, we
have an equation

RENE |=0;
where U, U', V, V' are quartic functions of , Þ; that is the ratio «: 4 has four values,
and to each of these there corresponds a single value of Q; viz. Q is determined by a
quartic equation.

14. Considering next the case n=5, the quintic transformation ; the elimination of Q
gives the equations

HEY W.

where U, U', &c. are all quadric functions of a, 3, y.
