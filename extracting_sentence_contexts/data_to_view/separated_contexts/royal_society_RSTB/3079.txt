Careful examination
of the anal region shows the presence of two large nuclei, one on either side
of the anus, which probably represent the rudiments of these structures. These
nuclei or cells are very unlike the teloblasts HarscHex (8) has described as giving
rise to these bands, and at no later period of development can I ever find them as
well marked as indicated in his figures. His figures, 57, 58, and 59, in fact, are
very misleading in this respect. The real pole cells of the mesoderm bands, if such we can call them, lie close under
the ectoderm, against its inner surface, almost touching the gut. They are most
satisfactorily seen in ventral views of the larva seen en face, and are conspicuous
for their large dark oval nuclei and lack of surrounding cytoplasm.
