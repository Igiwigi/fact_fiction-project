pp. 83 and 171), in the secondary yolk cells before they form the mid-gut epithelium.

In no other Peracaridan has a satisfactory account been given of the formation and
development of the endodermal layer. The determination of the fate of the yolk cells
or vitellophags and the origin of the liver in Hemimysis is of critical importance in the
conception of endoderm formation in the Peracarida generally and in the Decapoda.

The mid-gut in Hemimysis is long and formed directly by yolk cells. The liver has a
separate origin, arising from the mesoderm, or if the liver be considered as an endodermal
organ, then the head mesoderm bands can be termed mesendodermal. The fact remains
that the liver and mid-gut are not formed from a primary homogeneous endodermal layer.
Now suppose that from such a form as Hemimysis the proctodeeum became longer and the
mid-gut shorter ; then the yolk cells could not all become mid-gut epithelial cells. Those
lying in that part of the body traversed by the proctodeeum would necessarily degenerate,
as they do in Hemimysis at the sides of the short proctodeum. Thus the adult alimentary
canal would be practically entirely ectodermal, the greater number of yolk cells degénerat-
ing and the liver being developed just as in Hemimysis. It will be shown that such a
condition is probably found in the Isopoda, where the hind-gut is long.

The persistence or otherwise of the yolk cells in the Peracarida has been reported in
such different ways that it has been difficult to interpret the real nature and function of
these cells. It is probable that such difficulties are really non-existent, the yolk cells
