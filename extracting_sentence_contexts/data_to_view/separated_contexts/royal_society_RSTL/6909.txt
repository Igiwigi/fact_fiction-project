For, if the period is assumed to have been one of severe winter cold, we must
follow out the consequences of that assumption, not only with regard to the floods
following upon the winter snows, but in all its collateral bearings. The effect of the freezing of the rivers and the transport by ice of the boulders,
gravel, and organic remains lying on the shores, has already been discussed. In addi-

tion, however, to the ice 80 formed, observations of late years have Shown that a very
considerable formation of ice takes place along the beds of certain rivers, especially
when those beds are stony and gravelly, In these climates we rarely have the opportunity
of observing this phenomenon on a large scale, although, from a few facts noticed, it
appears even here to be far more common than has been supposed. That this agent is one of considerable power in producing changes of the character
we are referring to, is evident from the facts recorded by ARAGoÂ®, and the experiments
made by M. LrcLercef at Li6ge, and by Colonel Jacks0N in Russia.
