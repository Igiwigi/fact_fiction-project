20, it will be seen that they vary
very greatly in size, some being narrow and compressed, others being elongated in
the direction of the longer axis of the sorus ; the largest of these (x), show slight
lateral extensions of the sterile tissue into the sporogenous mass, these appearing as
partial septa : in other cases the septum may be complete, dividing the loculus into
two, while it is common to note two equal sporangia side by side, which thus illus-

trate a complete septation by means of a broader wall. It will be necessary, in view
of the theoretical interest which attaches to the question of septation, to look more
closely into the details of these extraordinary abnormalities, but I shall endeavour
first to give a plain statement of the facts, without reference to opinions which may
be based upon them. It is at the period when the difference in character of the tapetal and sporogenous
cells becomes clearly marked, both by form and contents, that these anomalies, of
which in early stages it is difficult to be sure, may be studied with some degree of
certainty. The sporogenous tissue does not appear to be always strictly limited to
so regular groups of cells as those previously described : thus in fig.
