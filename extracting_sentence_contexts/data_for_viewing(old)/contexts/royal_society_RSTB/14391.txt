situations but do not demonstrate any mitigating effect of social relationship
quality. The results indicate that the ability to modify communicative signals
may play an important role in navigating complex primate social interactions.

e-mail: peter.clark@ntu.ac.uk Given the importance of communication for forming and maintaining social
bonds, failures in communicative signalling can be costly to the signaller and/
or receiver. The potential for fitness costs means that there is selective pressure
on communicative signals to be clear and unambiguous ([1], p.882; [2]).
However, some signals might be under more selective pressure than others.
Signals that are used for different functions, by different animals, and in
different environments are under different levels of evolutionary pressure; mis-
understanding an alarm call could cause fatal results, but misunderstanding a
