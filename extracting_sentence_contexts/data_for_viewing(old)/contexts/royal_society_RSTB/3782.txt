and in either case we must assume a relationship between Forficula and Lumbricus
closer than that between Forficula and Stenobothrus. We have already shown that
no correlation exists between our present classification and the number of
chromosomes in a complex, and, if no correlation exists between lengths, the
attempts of McCiune and his followers to establish relationships between dimensions
of rods and somatic characters must prove abortive if carried beyond the limits of an
individual family.

Since no correlation apparently exists between number and length of chromosomes
and our classification of the animal kingdom, and, since current theories seem to be
contradicted by the facts enunciated in the preceding pages, I have constructed a
working hypothesis, which may assist us in the search for an explanation of these
phenomena.

If we assume that the substance of the primordial cell has become differentiated,
and if we define evolution as a transition of matter from an indefinite incoherent
