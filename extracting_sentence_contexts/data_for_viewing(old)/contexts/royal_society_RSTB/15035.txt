for practical purposes, conjecture is good, but knowing is
better. This is a phrase one of us (DBA) uses regularly and
is the basis for a book his school distributes freely at this
link [8]. So, we encouraged conjecture, but we also encour-
aged thinking how we can move from conjecture to
knowing. What studies, what methods, what experiments
would it take to move us toward greater knowledge, and
most of all, we encourage distinguishing between conjecture
and knowing.

The reader will find a rich diversity of opinions here. The
reader will find theories in both senses of the word. The
reader will find conjectures and facts pertinent to different
ideas of causation. There will be no shortage of entertain-
ment, of inspiring insights and of suggestions for key
future studies. Enjoy the buffet!
