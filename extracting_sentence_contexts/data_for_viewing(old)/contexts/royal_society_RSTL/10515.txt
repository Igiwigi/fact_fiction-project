that this is the pigment whose bands are seen in the almost colourless tentacle after
removal of the yellow cells, as it gives a band in blue and in the violet, spectrum 15,
Chart IV., besides the first. They read : 1st, X 582 to A 560 ; 2nd, X 5205 to X 506 ;
3rd, X 4945 to A 475. The first band probably belongs to a trace of actiniohzematin.
That this fluorescent pigment was not a 80-called © lipochrome ” is shown by the fact
that, on adding caustic soda, one of the bands near the violet end disappeared, while
with acetic acid the second and third bands appeared merged into one.

Summary and Remarks.

The above observations show that a respiratory colouring matter is present in
Actima mesembryanthemum, Bunodes crassicornts, and other Actinie. That it mus
be respiratory is shown by the fact that one of its decomposition products is capable
of existing in a state of oxidation and reduction. That it is closely related to hamo-
globin is shown by the results attending my attempts to convert ib into hamochromogen
and hematoporphyrin, as the pigments corresponding to these, obtained from the
above Actiniz, are undistinguishable from those obtained from hazmoglobin.

The occurrence of biliverdin in such lowly-organised animals is of great interest ; ib
may probably be looked upon as excretory, and, as I said above, a part of it seems to
be present in the state of a chromogen, as proved by the action of acids upon it.

The discovery of biliverdin in the ehells of certain mollusks by KRUKENBERG |
acquires an additional interest from these observations ; but it is premature to conelude,
as KrUkExBERG does, that here it is independent of the presence of hemoglobin,
