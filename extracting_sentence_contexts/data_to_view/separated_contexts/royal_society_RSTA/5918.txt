Let 27, be an arbitrary regular sub-manifold, where Zo € (0,27). Then, the open region Be = Uze(z)~,Z)+<) @z contains, for arbitrary small enough e > 0,
ergodic sub-manifolds 27. This is due to the fact that irrational numbers are uniformly
distributed on the real line (equidistribution theorem). We claim that it is impossible to find an infinitesimal symmetry continuous on B,, and
defined globally there, with a non-zero component along the z-direction. To see this,
suppose that such a symmetry exists, call it 9(x,y,z,t), and assume without loss of
generality that its z-component is equal to 1 at f=0,x =0,y =0,z = Zo: 1§(0,0, Zo, 0) =
1.
