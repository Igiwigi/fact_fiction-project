stereo correspondence problem. In fact, useful behaviour can be produced
Received: 31 March 2022 with very basic stereoscopic algorithms which make no attempt to achieve

fusion or correspondence, or to produce even a coarse map of depth across
the visual field. This may explain why some aspects of insect stereopsis
seem poorly designed from an engineering point of view: for example,
One contribution of 18 to a discussion meeting paying no attention to whether interocular contrast or velocities match. Such
issue ‘New approaches to 3D vision’. algorithms demonstrably work well enough in practice for their species, and
may prove useful in particular autonomous applications.
