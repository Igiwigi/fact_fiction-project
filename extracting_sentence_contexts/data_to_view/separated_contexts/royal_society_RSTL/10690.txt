M. Corxu did
nob directly measure these lines, but derived the numbers he has given from a
comparison of his photographs with his map of the solar spectrum. But the reason
why the wave-lengths we have given are probably the more correct lies in the fact
that about this region there are many iron lines, and our measurements of iron agree
with those of M. Corxv, while, if our cadmium lines departed from accuracy as far as
they differ from those of M. Conxv, this difference would occur in the iron lines,

ComPaRIs0N of the wave-lengths of lines from the spectrum of cadmium,
