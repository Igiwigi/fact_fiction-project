softer to the fingers than yet older, fully migrant locusts. The morning behaviour of these
more advanced fledglings was watched on three days: 10, 11 and 12 June 1943 (figure 2).
It was very warm, as the few temperatures entered in figure 2 show. Crawling activity did
not stop altogether even during the night, and basking became general almost immediately
after sunrise. But there was no sustained flying, and no mass departure. A consistent
direction did appear on 10 June, which is shown as streaming in figure 2, but in fact these
locusts settled with every small increase of wind. Had they remained in the air they would
certainly have been turned down-wind, and such alternating orientation has been described
as surging. On 11 June, a warmer day, the locusts flew rather more uninterruptedly, rising
higher in the air. On 12 June they were immobilized for most of the morning by a strong
wind. They surged up-wind and down-wind during a brief lull at 130 min. after sunrise and
again when the wind dropped after 320 min.
