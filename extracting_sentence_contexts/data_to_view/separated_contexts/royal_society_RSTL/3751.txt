On the other hand, when the nitrate is used, the brown hue frequently passes
to absolute blackness without any subsequent exposure to sunshine; and in that case
the photographs produced have an intensity and opacity scarcely, if at all, inferior to
that of printing ink. :

239. This high degree of opacity and depth, together with the comparative insen-
sibility of the ground, is evidently capable of being most usefully applied to the pro-
duction of retransfers. In fact, the photographs so produced being negative are 80
far titted for the purpose, and if used as models while in this, their transition state,
and as it were self-fixed, s0 far from being injured by the transmission of light, they
are actually acquiring additional sharpness and depth by every beam which passes. By seizing therefore the right point of dryness, and by using a very sensitive paper to
receive the impression, there is no reason to doubt of success in procuring very per-
fect positive transfers. Some trials I have made have satisfied me as to the practi-
