Two years ago an experiment was described by Mr. ArmsTrONG and others *,
in which the issue of a stream of high pressure steam into the air produced abundance
of electricity. The source of the electricity was not ascertained, but was supposed to
be the evaporation or change of state of the water, and to have a direct relation to
atmospheric electricity. I have at various times since May of last year been working
upon the snbject, and though I perceive Mr. ArmsTRONG has, in recent communi-
cations, anticipated by publication some of the facts which I also have obtained, the
Royal Society may still perhaps think a compressed account of my results and con-
clusions, which include many other important points, worthy its attention. 2076. The apparatus I have used was not competent to furnish me with much
steam or a high pressure, but I found it sufficient for my purpose, which was the in-
vestigation of the effect and its cause, and not necessarily an increase of the electric
development.
