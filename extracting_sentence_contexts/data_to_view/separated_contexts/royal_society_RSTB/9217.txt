anthropomorphic robotic limbs that reproduce much of the brain—-machine interfaces—i.e. neuroprostheses that are

opment and refinement of algorithms that decode intended fact, not only could animals discriminate ICMS pulse trains
movements from the neuronal activity measured in motor that varied in frequency, but they could also distinguish
areas of the brain. Together, these innovations make it poss- ICMS that was delivered to different neuronal populations
