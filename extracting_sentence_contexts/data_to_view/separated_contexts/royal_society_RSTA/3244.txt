It will appear from the
results below that these terms are at least of the seventh order in powers-of 1/r.
A fortiori LL, which is at least of the eighth order, will be omitted. The whole expression for V will now be divided into several portions. Let (e#), be that portion of e# in which each ellipsoid may be replaced by a
particle ; it is, in fact, the product of the masses of e and £ divided by 7,

Let (e#), be the rest of eH.

Let (vv) denote that portion of V in which the larger body £ may be replaced by a
sphere ; then

(vv) = gee+hll+[e+ 8,4 $0* (y?+2*)] 14+ 80. Similarly, let

(VV)
