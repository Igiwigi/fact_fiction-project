lower jaw always passes in front of the canine aboye. Even in the human subject
this characteristic relative position is shown by the molars and premolars, when the
upper incisors are produced beyond the lower ones.

The existing species of Mammalia that retain the typical formula of dentition, viz.

are few: but that formula was much less frequently departed from in the species of
placental Mammalia which were first introduced into this planet. This is a very sig-
nificant fact, and became manifest in the course of working out snch typical formula
by tracing and comparing the development of the teeth in the recent species.

In the oldest known strictly carnivorous mammal, e. g. the Zyanodon, remains of
which have been discovered in the newer eocene deposits of Hampshire, and in the
miocene formations of France, the complete typical dentition is retained, and each of
the three true molars presents the peculiar trenchant form of crown which charac-
terizes the single tooth called by Cuviss *le dent carnassicre” in the Lion : here,
therefore, we use the term * molar” in the same technical or arbitrary sense as the

- term © incisor * when applied to the tusks of the Elephant or the prongs of the Hip-
popotamus. In the mixed-feeding Amphicyon, a larger extinct miocene Carnivore-
allied to the Plantigrades, the three true molars have broad tuberculate crowns.
