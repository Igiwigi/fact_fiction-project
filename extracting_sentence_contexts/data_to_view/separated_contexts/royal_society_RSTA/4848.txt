If the synthetic and observed
properties match, one can say at least that the forward model provides one possible explanation
for the observed feature. Of course, other explanations might exist. However, when comparing
complex models to complex observations, there is a fair chance that, if the synthetic and real
observations match, the model is in fact a good description of the real Sun. In this context,
‘complex’ means that not just one single aspect is matching, but that many observables (in the best
case any one can think of) do match. To illustrate such synthesized observations, figure 2 shows
an emerging active region model covering 150 x 75 x 75 Mm’ after two sunspots appeared.
