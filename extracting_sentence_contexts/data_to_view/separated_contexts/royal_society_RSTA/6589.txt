As the plank is initially jerked into motion
the level piles up on one side and sinks on the other, but waves running round the edges of the
plank gradually rectify the difference of level at the plank, until as we have seen at time
t = (2b/c) the level has sunk to zero all round the plank. Thereafter the level tends to sink
farther on the leading side of the plank and to pile up on the other, but again this tendency
is counteracted by the new waves running in from the edges. So, in fact, we have an oscil-
latory process—the oscillations in level becoming smaller, and the motion settling down to
a steady one, as the wave energy spreads out from the plank over the surface of the
water. As pointed out earlier, the waves coming in at A, A’ ensure that there is no discontinuity
of pressure at the edge of the aerofoil (or of water level round the edge of the plank). The
detailed results given are broken off at z = 4ab.
