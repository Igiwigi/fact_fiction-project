44 THE REV. W. WHEWELL ON THE EMPIRICAL LAWS

closely with the theory, and which in its amount appears to depend only on the ratio
of the forces of the sun and moon, we find that in fact its amount is different at dif-
ferent places, as we have already stated. We cannot expect, therefore, that the
amount of the corrections for parallax and declination will agree very exactly with
those from theory; and till the empirical corrections are more certainly and generally
determined, I have not thought it worth while to make the comparison. But though there is at present this uncertainty respecting the amount of the in-
equalities of the tide, I do not conceive that there can be any doubt that the forms of
these corrections are such as I have stated them.
