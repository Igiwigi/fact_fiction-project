Colour Screens and Incandescent Gas.

Kout, in his work on Trianea, seems to have found no difficulty with artificial
light ; I find, too, that the stomata of Callitriche verna can be opened by incan-
descent gas; but with a number of terrestrial plants T have failed to open the

stomata of shut leaves even when the ligbt was concentrated by a lens.* I had, in
fact, concluded that the experiments with colour-sereens and artificial light must be
made with the above water-plants when I happened to find, in the cotyledons of seed-
ling Ipomeas and Cucurbitas, material sensitive enough for my purpose. The light
of the incandescent gas was concentrated on the experimental plant by passing
through a large globular flask before passing through the colour-sereens into the
experimental box. In this way it was found possible to cast a brilliant light on the
plant, and at the same time to keep it cool.

The preponderant effect of red light is clear in the observations on seedlings, princi-
pally of Cucurbita maxima, a few of Ipomea purpurea, and one of Cobaa macro-
stemma.,

Out of twelve observations on red light (718-639) there was only one failure to open
