Among the
consequences of this frustration and the resultant compromise are that optima
and equilibria are difficult to achieve and that responses to perturbations are
slow, in part extremely so, and often chaotic. A ‘cartoon’ to illustrate the character of a complex system is of a rugged
landscape with many hills and valleys and the system’s dynamics imagined
as movement on the landscape with only local vision, simple moves being
downward,! becoming stuck in intermediate valleys and unable to surmoun
ridges, needing a change of rule to overcome them (for example, also allowing
uphill moves), only to be faced by further barriers. In fact, the space of the
landscape is very high-dimensional and the difficulty extremely much greater
than for a mountain range on our three-dimensional Earth. Changing an externa:
influence parameter, such as temperature, magnetic field or other ‘pressure’, can
lead to ‘chaotic’ transformation of the whole landscape, removing the option of
straightfoward iteration to a solution. This paper is organized as follows: §2 introduces the issues and some of the
concepts derived in the context of spin glasses (in condensed matter physics) and
compares a related optimization problem that is simple to formulate but difficul
to solve; §3 considers further hard combinatorial optimization in computer
science, particularly in the context of satisfiability; §4 is devoted to some examples
from biology, in the form of neural networks and proteins; §5 addresses problems
involving speculative agents in finance/economics and opens the way to other
social sciences; §6 considers growing networks; §7 gives some typical magnitudes;
and §8 collects some conclusions and hints at the future.
