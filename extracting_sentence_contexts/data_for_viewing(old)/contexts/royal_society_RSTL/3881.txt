This uncertainty of the existence of any structure in the cord that seemed sufficient
to explain the reflected moyements on the same side of the body, independent of the
brain and the nerves of volition and sensation, long obliged me to withhold my assent
to the doctrines now received respecting these phenomena. Although the fibres that
pass transversely through ganglia might explain the effect produced on one side of
the body, by the irritation of a corresponding part on the other, there seemed no ana-
tomical structure to account for the moyements of distant parts, anterior or posterior
to a given point, on the same side, if the doctrine long received, that each fibre is en-
dowed with but one special function, were correct. Now, therefore, that we find an
anatomical structure in the cord that seems to account for these phenomena, I ought,
in justice, to state, that Dr. Har, to whom is due the high credit of collecting, com-
paring and arranging in one system numerous facts connected with the reflected
movements of animals, as observed by Wnvyrr, BLaxe and others, and also by him-
self,—adopting the principle established by our distinguished physiologist, Sir CHarRLEs
Ber, that every nervous fibre is continued unbroken from its origin to its termi-
nation, and is capable of ministering only to one special function, —conceived the ne-
cessity for the existence of special nerves for the reflected movements; and that, at
the period when I was engaged with Dr. Har in his experiments on this subject, in
1833, he requested me to examine the cord in the Hedgehog to ascertain the correct-
ness of his opinions. This examination was not made, becanse at that period I differed
from him in attributing the reflected movements to the agency of another part of
the nervous system. Now that the views of Dr. Hair seem proved to be correct,
I am desirous of adding this testimony of the acuteness and perception of one who
has done much for physiological science.
