Figure 6. Divergent CPGs underlying homologous behaviours. (a) Dendronotus iris swims with left-right whole body flexions. (6) The CPG underlying this
behaviour has a simple half-centre organization with the left and right Si2 inhibiting each other. Sil does not make or receive any contralateral inhibition.
©) Simultaneous intracellular recordings show that Si1 fires irregularly, whereas the two contralateral Si2 burst in alternation during the swim motor pattern.
(d) Melibe leonina swims in the same manner as Dendronotus. (e) The swim CPG in Melibe is more complicated than that of Dendronotus.
