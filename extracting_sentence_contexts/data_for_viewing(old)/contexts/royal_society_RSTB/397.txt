LEPIDOPTEROUS PUPA AND THEIR SURROUNDING SURFACES. 431

The results in the case of P. brassicew are probably more trustworthy, because the
numbers of pupa employed in the various experiments were more uniformly large.
The similarity of the results in the two species is very striking, and it would have
been even greater but for the fact that the palest varieties of P. brassicw retain more
pigment than those of P. rape. Looking at the colours which retard the formation
of pigment when they preponderate in the incident light, we see that they contain
certain rays in common which are probably highly efficient in this respect, 7.¢., the
rays from 57 to 59 or 60. The immense difference between the action of red and
orange corresponds to the fact that these active rays are present in the latter, and

they are also present in the highly efficient yellow and bright green—that is, in all

the colours which retard the formation of pigment, except white, which, of course,
contains these rays in addition to the others, although this is not necessarily the
case, and it would be extremely interesting to experiment with whites from which
this part of the spectrum is absent. Concerning such an experiment, it may be
argued that this relation of colour to pigment formation is essentially protective, and
