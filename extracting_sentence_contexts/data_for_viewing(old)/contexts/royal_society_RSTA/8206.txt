of properties near the level, 250 km. deep, where the conducting core begins (according
to CHAPMAN’s estimate based on the daily magnetic variations). There may, in fact,
be no sudden inerease of « at this level, but only a gradual increase, and this inerease
may continue to much higher values of « than 3-6.107%. ‘To throw light on this
point we here examine the actual distribution of the induced currents in the core (on

the supposition that it is uniformly conducting and that « = 3-65.10), both for
the daily variations and for magnetic storms. It is found that the currents penetrate
further in the latter case, but that below about 2000 km. they are small and have
only a slight influence on the surface magnetic field. Thus the region about which
these magnetic variations can afford information is unlikely to extend below this depth,
and may fall far short of it if the conductivity increases downwards. The comparison
of the induction-effects for the daily variations and for magnetic storms does, in fact,
indicate that the conductivity is not uniform below 250 km., but continues to increase,
and at a quite rapid rate. By considering the magnetic variations over a wider range
of period (or, in the case of aperiodic variations, of time scale), it may prove feasible
to determine the radial distribution of conductivity for some distance below 200 km.,

though the data now available scarcely suffice for this purpose. The inv
require a difficult extension of the mathematical theory if the conductivity is supposed
to vary continuously ; but it may prove sufficient to treat the earth as a series of
concentrie shells each of uniform conductivity ; the formule required in this case have
been given by CaapMan and Wurrennap (loc. cit.). In the present paper the detailed
analysis is concerned solely with a uniformly conducting core.
