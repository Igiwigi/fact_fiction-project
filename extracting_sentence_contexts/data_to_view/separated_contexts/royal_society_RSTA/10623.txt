A
similar effect is produced by drilling out one of the carbons and inserting a glass rod
as a core, probably due to the introduction of sodium into the vapour column. The
lower resistance and higher back E.M.F. of ares between cored carbous than of those
between solid carbons is also probably due to a similar cause, namely, the presence of
potassium silicate in the core. In fact, it seems probable that the whole of the
observed differences between solid and cored ares, and between ares for which
different makes of carbons are used, not only in resistance and back E.M.F., but also
in all their physical properties, are due to the different amounts of the traces of

foreign substances present in the are. The author believes that if it were possible to obtain perfectly pure carbon
electrodes, then the resistance of the are between them would be very high, so high
that it might be impossible to maintain a true are between them at all. He is of the
