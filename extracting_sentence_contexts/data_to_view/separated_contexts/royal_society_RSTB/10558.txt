Short-lived open
states may be due to immediate relaxation of the local
field upon pore formation [22,31,32]. We found that the
characteristic lifetimes for pores in over-hydrated bilayers
were essentially identical to those for standard DIBs
(figure 2e,f). Further, the fact that these distributions were
again best fit with double exponentials suggests that the
short-time components observed here and_ previously
reported do not result from any bilayer interaction with
the substrate.
