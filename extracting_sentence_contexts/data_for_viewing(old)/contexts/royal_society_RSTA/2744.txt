in space (the Poynting vector), is what springs to the forefront. For historians of science, it is
his decades-long battle-of-words with William Henry Preece (1834-1913), the pompous head of
engineering at the British General Post Office (the controlling agency of electrical communications
in England), battles that seem like something a Hollywood script-writer with an overheated
imagination might cook up.

In other words, the life of Oliver Heaviside was a pretty interesting one [3].

In the rest of this paper, I will discuss another ‘adventure’ of his that is not as well known as the
ones I just mentioned, one that has found new life in the modern physics literature dealing with
the theoretical possibility (or not) of time machines and time travel to the past. What Heaviside
would have thought of such things will be pure speculation on my part, as he never wrote (as far
as I know) on them, and was dead before the early science fiction magazines embraced the time :
travel concept with great enthusiasm. .

Heaviside must, of course, have surely been aware of H. G. Wells’ famous 1895 novella The
Time Machine but, again, I do not believe he ever put his thoughts about that work down on paper
(with one possible exception, which I will mention later). So, I will feel free to speculate, but I will
also do my very best to keep one foot (or at least a toe) in the real world.

Now, before we get down to business, let me end this opening section with the comment
that Heaviside has reminded some of his admirers of the eccentric, fictional scientist Haskel van
Manderpootz, professor of the ‘new physics’ (that is, relativity), who appeared in an hilarious
science fiction tale published 10 years after Heaviside’s death [4]. Compared to the ‘modest’ Van
Manderpootz (read Heaviside), all other physicists in the world are a mere ‘pack of jackals, eating
