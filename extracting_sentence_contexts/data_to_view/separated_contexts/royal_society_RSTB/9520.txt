Furthermore, the randomized trial mentioned above [1] indicates
that the benefits of cell therapy in terms of mortality, functional improvement
and increase in left ventricular ejection fraction are also no longer significant in
the subgroup of trials which have been blindly analysed. These comments
should not be interpreted as suggesting that there is no benefit to draw from car-
diac cell therapy in the context of heart failure. They simply call for some caution,
which is indeed consistent with the fact that if phase 2 clinical trials can give us a
suggested way forward, they are not tailored to conclusively establish that the
new therapy under investigation should be readily implemented in the clinics. In the case of the treatment of heart failure by stem cells, it is indeed not so sur-
prising that the first wave of clinical trials have not yielded results matching
the initial expectations which were definitely excessive. The likely main reason
is that these early trials have been clouded by the uncertainty which then sur-
rounded the optimal cell type to be used as well as the most efficient method of
cell transfer.
