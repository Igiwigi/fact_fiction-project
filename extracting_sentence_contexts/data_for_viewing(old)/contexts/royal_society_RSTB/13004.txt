Choosy populations are highlighted; they comprise two categories of CNVs: ‘Non-Choosiness-associated’ CNVs, that occur at high frequency exclusively in Non-Choosy
populations, and ‘Choosiness-associated’ CNVs, our prime candidates, that occur at high frequency exclusively in Choosy populations. Choosiness-associated CNVs
show a pattern of copy-number displacement and therefore show the clearest association with the evolution of positive assortative mate choice. (Online version
