The maximum oceurs at a higher induction than in the steel, and the drop
afterwards is more rapid. TRON AND STEEL IN A ROTATING MAGNETIC FIELD. 731

It may be noted that, while the first and last parts of the curve are in good
agreement, there is considerable divergence near the maximum, and repeated
experiment failed to remove this. In fact, when kept running at the maximum
value, the deflection was by no means steady, showing that it is a genuine phe-
nomenon, and not due to errors in the apparatus. Occasionally, in the latter half of
the curve, the same phenomenon occurred, the value altering slightly for a few
readings, and then coming back on to the original curve, without any alteration or
stoppage of the apparatus. In these experiments the induction was pushed as high as possible, and a
consistent continuous curve was obtained down to a very low value of the hysteresis.
