The Telencephalon. The basal centres of the telencephalon, dominated by olfactory impulses in Platypus,
are simple structures compared with those of other closely related brains which have
received any degree of intensive study. Without doubt, this fact may be correlated
with the peculiarity of the life of a recluse, whose radius of activity is rather short and
who, in spite of water as a medium for food exploration, prefers general cutaneous sensi-
bility to olfactory stimulation. he olfactory bulb, although quite typical of mammals,
is also not noticeably enlarged. The region about its dorso-lateral fissure, which the
writer has identified as the accessory olfactory bulb, ELiior Smrru (1895) thought to
contain “the ganglion of Jacopson’s organ.” He found no differentiation either in
fibre or cellular content, peculiar to this area. McCorrer (1912) substantiated this
observation by finding in the accessory olfactory bulb of the opossum all those structures
characteristic of the distinctly olfactory portion of the bulb.
