OF ALL THE PHENOMENA OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 101

netisgm had resisted every prior attempt to reduce them to the power of ana-
lysis. It will now be necessary to refer to those which relate to the reciprocal
action of iron bodies and a magnetic needle on each other, which were till
more uncertain, and apparently more anomalous, than the former.

In 1819 I undertook this investigation, and, after an extensive series of ex-
periments, I succeeded in reducing this reciprocal action likewise to very
simple laws, derived empyrically from the results I had obtained, but which
were obviously only approximative, although the approximation was very cloxe :
in the course of these experiments also a very remarkable fact was discovered ;
namely, that all the magnetic power of an iron sphere resides on its surface.
These first experiments, with the exception of the fact last mentioned, which I
had not then discovered, were presented to the Royal Society in 1819. I after-
wards extended my first researches, and published the whole in a small tract,
entitled, © An Essay on Magnetic Attraction.”

The simplicity of these results, and particularly the circumstance of the
magnetic power residing on the snrface only of the sphere, led Mr. Cnarrzs
BoxxycasTLE, (at present mathematical professor in the Uniyersity of Virginia,)
to undertake an investigation of the laws which an iron sphere ought to ex-
hibit according to a certain hypothesis relative to induced magnetism ; and he
succeeded in eliciting most of the formulze I had obtained empyrically from my
