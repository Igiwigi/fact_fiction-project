balloons have been followed by a theodolite up to 16 km. or more. Mr. Cave, who is
an authority on this point, considers that the wind falls off as the isothermal region is
reached, but on some occasions a strong wind is found at 15 km. ; there are four such
instances on record at Pyrton Hill. But the balloons can only be followed to great -
heights when the air is clear and the lower winds light. If the lower winds are
strong, the balloon is too far off to be visible long before it has reached the
isothermal region. ;

Qn many occasions there is no great wind up to at least 20 km., so that the
supposed strong westerly winds, if they exist at all, are intermittent, and different
in character to the N.E. and 8.E. trade winds.

The fact that from a station in England many quite likely tracks for a balloon end
in the sea introduces a large systematic error, so that no just conclusions can be
drawn from registering balloons in England as to ,the prevalence of certain winds.
In most cases the track runs parallel, or nearly so, to the surface isobars, so that
generally the direction of the upper wind does not greatly differ from that of the
lower, and since also very high ascents do not show longer runs than those of average
height, it is certain that the wind velocity decreases rather than increases above 10 or
12 km. But there is nothing in the observational results to negative the supposition
that strong winds may on some occasions exist at a height of 15 km. A _ persistent
current of this kind in the general circulation would be easily explained, but it is
hard to see in the case of intermittent winds whence the energy can come and where
it can go. Also cyclones cannot be caused solely by the upper winds, for if so they
would have no reason to avoid continental areas, and prefer moist areas, such as the
