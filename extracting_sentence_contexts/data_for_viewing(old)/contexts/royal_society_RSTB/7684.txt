There is, however, evidence of the existence of special aerodynamic sense organs on
Acridids, in the shape of patches of hairs on the frons and vertex which are sensitive to the
flow of air past the head (Boyd & Ewer 1949; Weis-Fogh 1949). Stimulation of these has
been shown to initiate flight itself once the insect is deprived of a foothold and, during flight,
to initiate contra-lateral (compensatory) turning responses when the air flow comes from
one side instead of dead ahead. These responses could clearly have a stabilizing effect on the
locustâ€™s flight direction, correcting its own deviations from a straight course, like the
halteres of flies (Pringle 1948). Since the same receptors would presumably record a change
in the wind direction, if that were sufficiently sudden, the responses could, conceivably,
serve to orient the flying locust on the wind, but this is more conjectural.

At present, there is no observational evidence that locusts do orient themselves to the
wind by such direct responses. The fact that the observed responses to wind changes were
less marked away from the ground, where the wind is stronger, than they were close to it
(p. 209), argues against direct responses to air movement participating in course and track
determination, however important they may be in securing stability in flight. Moreover, if
it is only the large-scale air eddies which are so shaped as to give the locusts pushes which
are biased in the wind direction, while between these the insects are subjected to more
numerous, randomly directed pushes, then it becomes very difficult to conceive how the
insect could utilize its aerodynamic sense organs for orientation to the wind. It is also
difficult to see, at present, how the same organs could be used, without confusion, for regu-
