If we further inquire into the cause of this relation, we find that the direction of
the melting-point curve is determined by the product of the absolute melting-point
into the quotient given by the volume change at the melting-point divided by the
latent heat of crystallization in the Clapeyron-formula for the change of the melting-
point by pressure. If the ratio between the absolute melting-points of two crystalline
forms remains constant at all temperatures and the melting-point values converge
toward unit value at the absolute zero, as in this case, it is therefore necessary that
the ratio between these quotients in the Clapeyron-formula should also remain
constant at all temperatures, and that the absolute values of the quotients should
themselves also converge towards unit value at the absolute zero. Nothing at present
is known about the absolute values of the factors entering into this quotient in the
Clapeyron-formula, and of the absolute change of these factors with changing
temperature, but the fact that a volume factor, as well as a heat factor, in the case of
both modifications is affected by pressure in a similar way is of considerable interest.

The changes of the latent heats of crystallization must depend on the changes of
the specific heats of the liquid and of the crystals, and to these changes the changes
of the latent heat of transition between the two modifications probably aiso
corresponds. The volume changes again must depend upon the compressibility of the
liquid and of the crystals. The intersection of the melting-point curves at the
absolute zero thus points to the probability that the values of all these properties for
both modifications converge toward unit value at the absolute zero.

It may suffice here to point out briefly that in the case of the energy factors this is
what is required by the heat theorem of Nernst, and that the other factors again
