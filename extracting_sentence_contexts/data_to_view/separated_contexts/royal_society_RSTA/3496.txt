This is the series of circular configurations, and corresponds to the series of
Maclaurin spheroids in the three-dimensional problem. When o? > 2zp the solution
breaks down physically, since the pressure at every point of the liquid becomes
negative. In fact, when w* reaches the value w? = 2zp the series gives place to
a series of annular forms, for each of which has the critical value.
