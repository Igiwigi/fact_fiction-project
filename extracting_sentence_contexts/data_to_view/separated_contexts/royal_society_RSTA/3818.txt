In order to limit
this effect, the Hillerborg regularization model has been included [14]. In this method, the energy
consumed by a crack to propagate through a band of finite elements is no longer dependent on the
mesh size because of a fixed characteristic length L¢. In fact, the method consists in modifying the
softening part of the stress-strain relation in order to obtain the same fracture energy whatever
the mesh size. To do so, a new variable w is introduced,

@=1 if eq Ep, (2.13)
L

w= Py (1 - =) =“a(Ri) if eq > ep, (2.14)
& E L

where &p = H€pet(1 - )Epd with Ept and Epd being, respectively, the peak strain in tension
and compression. a(R;) is a corrective function dependent on the dynamic increase factor Rj. This variable w is included in the damage formula (equation (2.4)) to adapt the damage kinetic,
taking into account the characteristic length L, of the material and the finite-element characteristic
length Le,

As proposed by Hillerborg et al. [14], the characteristic length L. is assumed to be directly
linked to the fracture energy G; and the static tensile strength f, of the material under

consideration,
