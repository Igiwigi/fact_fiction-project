In a number of plants a greater or lesser number of small bright yellow
spots were found superimposed on the normal X¢ mottle. In those cases where the
inoculum was obtained exclusively from these yellow spots the inoculated plants
exhibited an increasingly more virulent type of reaction. These facts led to the view


ITS STRAINS AND REACTIONS 177

that although the X° strain reacted generally in a uniform manner, the cultures were
nevertheless contaminated with a more severe type of virus. It was natural to suppose that inasmuch as the L type had been recovered from
another spot on the same leaf of the same plant as that from which the G strain was
derived, we should find that the virus strain which was acting as a contaminant would
be the Z type. Curiously enough, the X” type was only recovered twice in the X¢
series even when it was put to the most severe analysis.
