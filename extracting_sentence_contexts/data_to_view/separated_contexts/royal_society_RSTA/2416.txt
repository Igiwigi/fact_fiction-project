This is already becoming a reality in organic
photovoltaics, where combinatorial screening [60,61] and machine learning algorithms [62-64]
are being applied. Stability is also a key issue that affects all organic related devices. The fact that organic
light emitting based TV screens became commercially available a few years ago suggests that


there is not a fundamental limitation that would prevent real-world application of this class of
materials. However, important issues still need to be understood and addressed depending on
each technology and its requirements (e.g. in terms of encapsulation and operation conditions). In the case of organic thermoelectrics, perhaps one pressing need is to obtain stable doping levels,
particularly stable n-type materials.
