In the dorso-lateral margin of the bulbus olfactorius there is found a large fissure
which extends about half way into its bodyâ€”the fissura bulbi olfactorii (f.b.0., fig. 31, b). It disappears slightly anterior to the attachment of the bulb to the ventral surface of
the telencephalon. The lateral ventricle of the telencephalon is not continued as a
cavity into the olfactory bulb ; in fact at its point of attachment the bulb is solid. In
the more rostral levels of the bulb, the fissure of the bulb is plugged by a solid ellipsoidal
mass. In all probability this fissure marks the site of the accessory olfactory bulb and
the ellipsoidal plug is, in part at least, the vomero-nasal nerve fibre-mass.
