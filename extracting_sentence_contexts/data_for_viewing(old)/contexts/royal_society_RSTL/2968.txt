ordinary temperature, which is about 10® or 15® above that of the atmosphere, is considerably increased during
the period of incubation, exactly the same as in the nest of Bombus terrestris.

On the following day after examining the nest of the wasp, I examined the temperature and pulsation of the
larva of the same species. The specimens examined had been remoyed from the nest on the previous evening,
but had not been removed from their cells. The results are given on the accompanying table, I examined
als the larva of the hornet, Vespa Crabro, Lixx., which was till contained in its cell, but had been some days
removed from the nest. In this instance the temperature of the larya was found to be about 2*:5 Fanx. above that
of the atmosphere, but its rate of pulsation was only thirty-two beats per minute. I should have attributed this
low rate of pulsation to the specimen having been 80 long remoyed from the nest, had not the rate of pulsation in
this larva been examined by my friend Mr. OzxsBorx a few days before, and almost immediately after the
specimen was obtained from its nest, and found at that time not to exceed thirty-three or thirty-four beats per
minute. These facts therefore are in accordance with the observations on the larya of Anthophora retusa and
Bombus terrestris, and also accord with other observations on the laryz of that very destructive tenthredo or
aw fly Athalia centifolia, KLuc ; which has been 80 obnoxious to the agriculturist by destroying his crops of
turnips during the last three xummers.
