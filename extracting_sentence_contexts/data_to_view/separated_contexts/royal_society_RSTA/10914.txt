When lightly etched, a power of 50 diameters
brought out a beautifully regular pattern of rectangular crosses and bars on a dark
ground that was finely. mottled with gold. The ground was brown and the pattern
generally golden, but under some conditions of etching the pattern seemed to be
white, and many of the minute specks in the brown mother-substance seemed to be
white also. A power of 1000 brought out very clearly the fact that the ground was a
eutectic mixture. A slowly-cooled alloy, containing 18Â°1 atoms, of which we give a
photograph (fig. 2), presented a very similar pattern, but on so large a scale that it was
visible to the naked eye ; the pattern in the slowly-cooled alloy was, however, always
golden. Although we have mentioned the occasional whiteness of the pattern in the
16:9 atom alloy, we do not feel able to attach any importance to it, as it was probably
due to some electrolytic action occurring during the process of etching.
