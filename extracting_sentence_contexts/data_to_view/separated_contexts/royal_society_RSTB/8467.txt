When the external input is decreased below a critical amount, as in the bottom image of (c), the activity on the
neuronal sheet gets easily distorted and hexagonal structure is not detectable over time. At the same time, the head-directional input becomes the dominant source
of input and the neurons show high directional tuning. (a,b) Adapted from [32]; (c,d) from [33]. The fact that a purely inhibitory network can generate grid these sets of studies suggest that connections do not have
