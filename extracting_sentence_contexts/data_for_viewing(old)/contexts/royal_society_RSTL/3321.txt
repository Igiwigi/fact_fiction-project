40. The blood-corpuscles when passing into cells for the formation of muscular
fibre, are darker in colour than those destined to form the chorion. There seems to
occur in them an increase of red colouring matter (par. 43.).

41. The masses of globules seen by VaLEeNTIN (par. 28.) to accumulate between the
muscular threads,—globules which were © round or roundish” and © somewhat larger
than the blood-corpuscles,” —I would suggest may really have been blood-corpuscles,
which had assumed a globular form, and increased in size in the manner above de-
scribed. VaLENTIN, however, states that the globules in question entered into the
formation of the © uniting mucous tissue-þ.”

42. In connexion with the fact now recorded, that muscular fibre is formed of
corpuscles of the blood, an observation may be referred to which has been mentioned
by several authors; namely, that of a disposition to run into combinations, and
form objects compared by Hewsox to rolls of coin. I find it yery usual for this ap-
pearance to arise in blood obtained by a puncture (as of the finger), and to which no
addition has been made.—R. Wacxzr mentions that in blood taken from the heart of
8ome of the Invertebrata—Unio and Anodonta—when the coagulating fibrin makes its
appearance, blood-corpuscles are seen—often grouped necklace-like—around it.

43. Others have supposed muscular fibre to be formed by the blood-dises ; but I
am not aware of any facts having been observed which warranted the supposition.
It is remarkable that a conjecture on this subject in one of the papers of Sir EvErarD
Homz \ should have approached s0 near the truth. His conjecture was, © That the
