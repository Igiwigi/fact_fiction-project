of 70*8, Five specimens which had previously been very active, and were now per-
spiring profusely, raised the temperature of a phial, whose cubic bulk was about two
inches, from 70*5 to 71%4. Nine insects in a similar-sized phial raised the tempera-
ture in four minutes from 70*5 to 722, and a few minutes afterwards to 73%2. During
this time the insects were in a state of the greatest excitement. The bulb of the ther-
mometer was not brought into contact with the bodies of the insects. When the
thermometer was placed among the beetles, and in contact with their bodies, the
mercury rose to 745, a difference of at least 4* above the original temperature of
the bottle ; but this was far from being the full amount of the heat of these insects.
During these obseryations I found that a large amount of heat generated by the in-
sects confined in the phial becomes latent, and also that much caloric is radiated
from the exterior of the phial, which becomes heated by the beetles and warm air
within, as is proved by the fact that when the thermometer is held very close to the
8ide of the phial without touching it, the mercury is considerably affected, and when
the bulb of the thermometer is held in contact with the phial the mercury ascends
the scale. In the present experiment it rose more than a degree when the bulb of
the thermometer touched the side of the phial. It must not be forgotten that besides
this difficulty in our observations on the temperature of insects, there is another which
prevents us from knowing the exact amount of heat generated by the insect under
examination. It is seen in these observations on the Melolonthw, as before shown in
the Bombi, that alarge amount of the heat generated by the body of an insect quickly
passes off into the surrounding medium. But if the excited state of the insect be ex-
cessive, and the consequent evolution of heat greatly exceed its usual amount, nature
has resorted to another expedient for cooling down the animal body, through means
of a profuse perspiration, which is carried on in insects perhaps to a greater extent
