Were the ccenenchymal tubes symmetrically distributed, either in a
quincunx or in parallel rows, the entire suppression of groups of seven and the arrest
of growth of the inner walls of twelve tubes surrounding each group, would leave the
walls of adjacent tubes projecting as twelve pseudosepta into the cavity thas formed. In Heliolites the pseudosepta are constantly twelve in number, and their presence
appears to result from this mode of formation; but in Heliopora the explanation 1s
more difficult, and has bafiled me. It is obvious that there is no homology between


AFFINITIES OF HELIOPORA C@RULEA, 463

Q pseudosepta of such Alcyonarian corals as Heliopora and Heliolites and the septa
of the Madreporariaâ€”a fact which has already been pointed out by Mosetny. As regards the minute structure of the corallum, in many points I have not been
ble to make my observations agree with those of MosExery, and I have been quite
unable to reconcile his fig. 4 with any of my sections.
