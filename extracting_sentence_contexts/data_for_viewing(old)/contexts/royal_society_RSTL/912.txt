inflammable gas, were carbon and water; which last, though
probably not a constituent of gases, is, however, copiously dif-
fused through them. If the evolved hydrogen proceeded from
the decomposition of the former of these two substances, it is evi-
dent that a certain volume of the carbonated hydrogenous gas
must yield, alter electrization, on combustion with oxygen, less
carbonic acid than an-equal volume of non-electrified gas ; or,
in other wards, the inflammation of 20 measures of carbonated
hydrogen, expanded by electricity from 10, should not afford
s0 much carbonic acid as 10 measures of the unelectrified.

From the fact which has been before stated, respecting the in-
creased consumption of oxygen by the electrified air, it follows,
that in determining the quantity of its carbon by combustion,
such an addition of oxygen should be made, to that necessary
for the saturation of the gas before exposure to the electric shock,
as will completely saturate the evolved hydrogen. For if this
caution be not observed, we may reasonably suspect that the
product of carbonic acid is diminished, only because a part of
the heavy inflammable air has escaped combustion. It might,
indeed, be supposed, that in consequence of the superior afti-
nity of carbon for oxygen, the whole of the former substance,
contained in the dense inflammable gas, would be saturated,
and changed into carbonic acid, before the attraction of hydro-
