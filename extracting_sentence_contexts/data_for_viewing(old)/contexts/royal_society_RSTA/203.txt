We turn next to the single molecule studies of fluorescing nanoparticles, which
will illustrate some of these points. Most of the discussion will focus on a certain
class of these particles, but the goal has a broader aim. In a sense single molecule
studies although now widespread are still in an early stage. Even for the most
widely studied system, CdSe nanoparticles, new facts are being discovered while
we write. Not only is the theoretical picture incomplete but also the experimental
one on which competing theories are based. What we learn from studies of this
particular group of systems can in some measure provide a base not only for
suggesting new experiments but also for developing theoretical ideas on new
systems in the single molecule field as a whole.

3. Nanoparticles and colloid chemistry

Colloid chemistry is well recognized as a venerable well-studied field. Since the
colloidal sizes range from micrometres to nanometres, the study of ensembles
of nanoparticles is a branch of colloid chemistry. They are correspondingly
ubiquitous. Colloidal gold nanoparticles, for example, gave us the millennium-old
