For most gases, and in particular for air in the visible spectrum, three terms of the
expansion are sufficient to represent the observed facts with high accuracy, so that

(n2—1) = [ag-+b,A-2+-c,d-4] d. (6-2)

This equation and the corresponding equation for the Lorenz-Lorentz expression
(1:3), namely,

(n?—1)|(n2+2) = [a5 +bgl-2-+0,-4] d, (6-3)

are based on theoretical relations concerned with the propagation of light through a
transparent medium. With a gas under normal conditions the value of (n—1) is small, so that, if we put
(n—1) =r, then the equations (6-1), (6-2) and (6-3), respectively, may be written
in the following forms, since (n?—1) = 2r+r? = 2r(1+17/2) and (n?—1)/(n?+2) =
(2r+-7?)/(8+2r+7?) = 2r(1—7/6)/3:

re [a,-+b,A-2-+-¢,A-4] d, (6-4)
r = (1—1/2) [ay +b,d-2+-c,d-4] d/2, (6-5)
r= (1+1/6) [ay +-byd-2-+¢,A-4] 34/2. (6-6)

To a first approximation, since 7 is small, equations (6-5) and (6-6) reduce to the same
form as (6-4), in which, for a given radiation, the refractivity is proportional to density,
but it is also evident that if the measurements of refractivity of gases are of sufficiently
high accuracy it may be possible to distinguish between the three relations. Striking experimental confirmation of the Lorenz-Lorentz relation for gases was, in
fact, obtained by Magri (1905), who made determinations of the refractivity of air at
densities corresponding to pressures from about 1 to 200 atm., using a Jamin refracto-
meter with the green line of mercury (A = 5461 A). But Magri erroneously described
his results as proving the constancy of the expression (m?—1)/(n?+1)d, and this
expression has, in consequence, frequently been quoted as an independent empirical
refraction constant, whereas, in fact, it appears simply to have been substituted by some
curious error in place of the Lorenz-Lorentz expression (n?—1)/(n?+-2) d at the head
of a column of figures actually calculated from this latter. We have therefore deemed
it of sufficient importance to reprint the results of Magri’s observations in the first
three columns of Table IX, together with his quoted calculation of the values of
(n?—1)/(n?4-1)d in the fourth column.
