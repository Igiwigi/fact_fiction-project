remains a valuable parameter, for in terms of it these systems may still be quantitatively
compared with spiral systems, and, indeed, quantitative differences may be established
even between apices which are usually regarded as displaying the same phyllotaxis, e.g.
there is no reason to suppose that all opposite decussate apices have the same plastochrone
ratio or phyllotaxis index, and a comparative study within this group might well prove of
interest. Rising phyllotaxis will not be reflected here in a change in the number of con-
spicuous parastichies, but it will alter the angle of intersection in the 2:2 spiral system. The
relation between this angle and phyllotaxis index is not entirely without interest, and will
be elucidated in the following paragraphs, especially as its inclusion completes the survey
undertaken in earlier sections.

These various systems from which ‘rising’ phyllotaxis (in the usually accepted sense) is
excluded, all derive geometrically from the fact that a new primordium always appears in
a position bisecting angles between the primordia of the preceding whorl; even in the
alternate arrangement the new member may be regarded as bisecting the 360° angle round
the whole apex terminated in either direction by the centre of the preceding primordium.
It follows that the leaves produced at any node are orthostichous with those separated from
them by two, four, etc., internodes. All these phyllotaxis systems are then essentially

similar, the sole difference residing in the numbers of leaves occurring at the nodes, one in
the alternate, two in the opposite decussate, x in alternating whorls of x. Hence in the
opposite decussate arrangement we are dealing simply with a bijugate version of the alternate
