method, the search-coil is either jerked out of a given position in the field, or turned
through a small angle, or else the field is suddenly removed, or reversed, while the
search-coil remains stationary. This method, however, notwithstanding its great
importance as a method for ascertaining the magnetic flux through a given area in
the field, can hardly be regarded as a method for delineating lines of induction.
The same remark is applicable to two other methods; that in which the field
intensity is ascertained by measuring the resistance of a bismuth spiral; and that
in which a conductor conveying a known current is placed in the field, and the pull
on the conductor is measured.

The experimental method which the above investigation proves to be accurate, is
applicable to two-dimensional problems only. In so far as this is the case, its scope
may appear restricted. But when we consider the fact that in the practical applica-
tions of magnetism, the bulk of the phenomena with which we have to deal are of
the two-dimensional order, it will be recognised that it offers a solution of problems
whose interest and importance are by no means inconsiderable. The magnetic field
in and around the armature of a dynamo or alternator, and that in and around
a cylindrical case which is used for purposes of magnetic shielding, are examples
of important practical problems in two dimensions.

One very important feature which characterises the method, is the fact that it
enables us to obtain the exact shape of the lines of induction not only in air, but
