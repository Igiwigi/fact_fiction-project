On now
adding sulphate of magnesium, howeyer, to the amount normally present in sea-
water, the Sarsi@ became more active, I next tried the effects of chloride of sodium
dissolved in fresh water to the point of saturation, or nearly 80, The Sarsi@, of course,
floated to the surface, and they immediately began to show symptoms of torpidity, The
latter became rapidly more and more pronounced, till spontaneity was quite suspended. The animals, however, were not dead, nor did they die for many hoursâ€”their irritability
continuing unimpaired, although their spontaneity had s0 completely ceased. The ten-
tacles and polypite were exceedingly relaxed, which is an interesting fact, as being the
converse of that which occurs in water containing too small a proportion of salt. Lastly, to give the density hypothesis a still more complete trial, I dissolved various
neutral salts and other substances, such as sugar &c., in fresh water till it was of the
density of sea-water ; but in all cases, on immersing Sars/@ in such solutions, death was
as rapid as that which followed their immersion in fresh water. VII.
