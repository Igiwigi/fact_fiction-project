A New Theory of Multi-phased Gastrulation Among Insectsâ€”The theory to be discussed
is essentially a development of the newer biphased gastrulation theory and has been
necessitated by certain facts recently discovered by myself and other authors. It
also attempts, in part, to combine the already described older and newer biphased
gastrulation theories. From both of these, however, it differs in the fact that insect
gastrulation is no longer to be regarded as a process occurring in only two main
periods of activity but in several. This, it need hardly be pointed out, has been
brought about by the large amount of yolk present in insect eggs. The whole
process of gastrulation has been extremely elongated in time and the time relations
of the various phases of the process are profoundly modified.
