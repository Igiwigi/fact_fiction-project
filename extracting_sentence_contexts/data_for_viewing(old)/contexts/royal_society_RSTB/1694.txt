It has already been stated in Part I. that the experiments with the frog nerve-
muscle galvanoscope show that the uninjured fish responded readily to mechanical,
and less easily to electrical, stimulation of the surface of the skin beyond the limits
of the organ, this response being, in the case of the organ, a reflex discharge. That
such a response is a reflex one, and not due to excitation of the efferent electrical
nerves, is evidenced by the long and variable period of delay which elapses between
the excitation and the electrical response, this period having a minimum of ‘02 to ‘03
second,

It was pointed out that if the stimulus was applied to the surface of the skin over
the organ, the resulting electrical response was, as regards its initial effect, not reflex,
but due to the stimulation of the efferent nerves of the organ in the immediate
neighbourhood of the excited area; this being proved by the fact that there is
always a constant short period of delay (from ‘004 to ‘008 second according to the
temperature), identical in character with that found in the case of the isolated organ.

It is evident that by the frog galvanoscope it is impossible to ascertain whether or
not such a direct nerve organ response is followed by a reflex one, but the capillary
electrometer records show that this may be the case. They thus confirm and extend
the results of those observations. A tap on the caudal fin beyond the organ or its
electrical excitation caused a reflex response which is evidenced in the records; and
it was noted, that whereas such response could only be evoked by an intense
electrical stimulus, it was readily produced by a very weak mechanical stimulus, a
slight touch with the finger being often quite adequate to evoke it.
