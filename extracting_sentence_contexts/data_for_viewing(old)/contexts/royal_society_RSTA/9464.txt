The quantities within the brackets are extrapolation values.

The following general conclusions may be drawn from the above facts :—

(1) That, in spite of the varying thermal effects obtained on diluting different
solutions, these effects may be expressed in a simple manner for the range over which
the solutions may be considered concentrated ;

(2) That when the solutions become more dilute they, at the same time, become
more complex ;

(3) That those thermal changes occur in strong aqueous solutions, which suggest
