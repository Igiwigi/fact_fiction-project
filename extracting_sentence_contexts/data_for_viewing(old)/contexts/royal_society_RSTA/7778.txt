DIFFRACTION AND REFRACTION OF WIRELESS WAVES 299

phase angle of ¢ is no longer nearly — }7, but is much nearer zero. Referring again to
fig. 7, the direction of BX instead of being }7 is now $7—v from (6-27), i.e. is 4-4-0’,
where v’ is a positive angle considerably less than 47. The minimum resultant is now
cos v’ instead of 1/,/2, and the initial drop is much less, with a correspondingly smaller
value of h,,;,- On the scale on which the curves are drawn in fig. 8 the effect is there-
fore negligible, except on the longer waves over sea, and we would not expect to be
able to detect the effect experimentally.

Since |7| increases as ¢ and A decrease, the initial parts of the curves in fig. 8 get
steeper as the wave-length is decreased, and the over land curves are much steeper than
the over sea ones. This is equivalent to the fact that the ground attenuation due to earth
losses increases rapidly with decreasing ¢ and A.

By using the reciprocal theorem the analysis applies as well to the case when the
receiver is on the ground and the transmitter is elevated. By combining both cases the
effect of having both the transmitter and receiver elevated can be calculated. If hy
and h, are the heights of the transmitter and receiver respectively above the ground,
then the signal strength at the receiver is obtained by adding to the value worked out
with both assumed on the ground, the gain reckoned from the ground up to hp, plus the
gain reckoned from the ground up to /;. We thus get the benefit of the large initial
gain close to the ground twice over, and the net gain is considerably greater than would
be obtained by raising either the transmitter or the receiver alone to a height hyp+hp.
For a given value of hy +h, the optimum arrangement, if practical, is to make hy, = hp.
