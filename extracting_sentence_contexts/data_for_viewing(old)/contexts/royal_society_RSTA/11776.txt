ssible, enable a well-defined line of demarcation to be traced. Attention must
“Bherefore be directed to ascertaining to what extent the mechanical properties of a
given sample of metal are due to each of these kinds of structure, and how far to
uch relations as are possible between them. This being the case, we considered that
ft would be interesting to submit the gold, containing 0°2 per cent. of various
ements, to micrographical examination, and, fortunately, the identical specimens:
gvhich were submitted by one of us to the Royal Society eight years ago, had been
spresorved intact, and were available for examination.
3 % Gold is a metal which may readily be purified to a high degree. It does not
®xidize in air at any temperature. The influence of occluded gases appears to be small ;
nd the quantity of the added element is in each case so small as to favour the view
Ghat, at least, most of the impurity remains dissolved throughout the mass without
there being liquation either of definite or indefinite compounds. We have, in fact,
