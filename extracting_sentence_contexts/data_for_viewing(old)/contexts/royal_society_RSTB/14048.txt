mean values shows broad overlap between core and edge
within a given garden site, including the site with the warm-
est conditions (NC). This finding, along with the significant
heritability for phenology and growth, suggests that standing
levels of genetic variation within the core is already high, and
edge genotypes may provide little additional benefits, at least
for these specific traits.

Lastly, plants from the margin appear to behave quite dif-
ferently from the other two regions. Plants from the margin
express very high growth, likely attributable to hybrid
vigour through introgression with its congener, black
spruce. Despite the fact that bud break plasticity under
warming was highly maladaptive for margin plants, their
hybrid vigour outperformed core and edge plants across all
environments. However, margin plants did suffer a decline
in growth at the range edge sites (VT and NC) compared to
the more central MD site. One could argue that past intro-
gression of black spruce genes into margin populations

represents another form of (unassisted) gene flow that has
produced clear benefits in terms of growth across the entire
range of climates tested in our experiment. Thus, natural
hybrid genotypes such as those that appear in the margin
and have been vetted by selection, may offer an additional
