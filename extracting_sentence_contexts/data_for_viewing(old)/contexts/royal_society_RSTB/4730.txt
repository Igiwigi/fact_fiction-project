The peculiarity of this insect is that the portion of the wing surrounding the
iridescent green patches is brown at normal incidence, but turns blue and then green
as the angle increases (see p. 17). It was thought that sections from the two
portions of the wing might yield instructive information. A section from the
central green part (Plate 1, fig. 3a) shows a periodic structure of the typical sort,
except that the chitin plates, @, are very thin and close together, their centres being
about 0°6 » apart, If the air film is a half wave-length thick, two half wave-lengths
remain for each of the plates, provided they are not double.

A section from the peripheral blue area (Plate 1, fig. 3b) shows a very striking
contrast. The chitin pillars, a, instead of being over 2 in height, are less than 1 p,
becoming, in fact, merely bosses of chitin at the extreme edge of the blue border.
The change of colour is no doubt correlated with this variation in height, for it is

clear that the number of plates traversed by a ray of light at any angle depends
upon the height of the plates, as well as upon the inclination of the ray; and the
greater the number of interfering surfaces, the greater will be the saturation of the
resulting colour, This is indeed the case, for at normal incidence the central portion
is bronze green, the periphery brown, whereas, when the incidence increases, more
and more plates are cut by the oblique rays, and the central portion changing to a
vivid green, seems to spread outwards, because the periphery containing the shorter
