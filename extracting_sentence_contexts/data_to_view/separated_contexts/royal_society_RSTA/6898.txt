The structure of the ocean basins is one of the most outstanding problems of geology. The
fact that the rocks which form the floor of the ocean are not directly accessible for investiga-
tion renders its solution a matter of considerable difficulty. Until recently, almost the only
data available were derived from soundings and bottom samples, but the development of
geophysical methods now provides means by which additional information can be ob-
tained. One of the most notable advances was the development, by Professor F.
