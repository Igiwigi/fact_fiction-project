This generalization may perhaps be extended to
leaves also, along the following lines. In the ferns there is evidence that growth-regulating
substances are formed in the apical cell and move downwards in the shoot. From the fact
that leaf primordia arise on the apical meristem whereas buds are formed lower down or,
more usually, remain inhibited, it may perhaps be inferred that leaf formation is stimulated
by concentrations of growth-regulating substances that inhibit bud formation. But in
close proximity to the apical cell, where the concentration of growth-regulating substances
is greatest, leaf formation will be inhibited. If, however, the apical cell is destroyed, leaf
primordia may eventually be formed in close proximity to the extreme tip.
