The values of ¢, and ¢, are represented in figure 21 as functions of 7 and those of s in figure 22
as functions of kT/¢. The curve s has again a point of inflexion, defining the transition
temperature at a value of kT./é which cannot be distinguished from (111). The inclination
of the tangent increases and hence the height of the maximum for the derivative of s. We
notice that the difference in behaviour between three and five levels is rather small from the
point of view of the location of the transition temperature. The reason for that is that the new
parameters ¢ which we introduce to represent the new levels are very small in the neighbour-
hood of the critical point.

The calculations can be carried on to any number of levels. In the vicinity of the transition
temperature there is practically no further change. Also the parameters ¢ do not become 1,
at any rate for temperatures for which 7 <0°8, in spite of the fact that for an infinite number
of levels ¢(x) =1 is a solution of equations (100) and (102).

The change in the value of the transition temperature, according to Bethe’s method,
occurs therefore at the passage from two to three levels. Although we also expect to have
a decrease in the correct transition temperature, when the number of levels is increased, we
do not know whether this decrease will be as substantial as it is in Bethe’s approximation,
owing to the anomalous behaviour of the two-level problem in this approximation.
