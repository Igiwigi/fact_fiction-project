sparks or ramifications, or even a feeble stream of electricity through the air
from either the point p or n, iodine will be immediately evolyed.

323, These effects must not be confounded with those due to the true elec-
tro-chemical powers of common electricity, and must be carefully avoided
when the latter are to be observed. No sparks should be passed, therefore, in
any part of the current, nor any increase of intensity allowed by which the
electricity may be induced to pass between the platina wires and the moist-
ened papers, otherwise than by conduction ; for if it burst through the air, the
effect referred to ensues.

324. The effect itself is due to the formation of nitric acid by the combi-
nation of the oxygen and nitrogen of the air, and is, in fact, only a delicate
repetition of CavenDIsn's beautiful experiment. The acid s0 formed, though
small in quantity, is in a high state of concentration as to water, and pro-

duces the consequent effects of reddening the litmus paper, or preventing the
exhibition of alkali on the turmeric paper, or, by acting on the iodide of po-
tassium, eyolving iodine.

325, By moistening a very small slip of litmus paper in solution of caustic
potassa, and then passing the electric spark over its length in the air, I gra-
