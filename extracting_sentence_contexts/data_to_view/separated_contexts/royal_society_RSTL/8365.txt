In my former memoir on explosive agents I discussed* incidentally the influence of
an accumulation of heat in a mass of gun-cotton in promoting violent explosion or deto-
nation, if through any cause the materials become ignited, an influence which equally
affects other explosive agents. This point has acquired much additional importance
8ince the publication of that Paper, in consequence of its probable bearing upon the
violent explosions which occurred at the Gun-cotton Works at Stowmarket in August
1871, and of the possibility thereby rendered manifest that violent explosions of gun-
cotton, or other substances of analogous properties, may occur under circumstances
which until lately were not considered to involve hazard. The fact that the previous application of heat to an explosive agent increases the
violence with which this will explode when flame, or a sufficiently powerful source of
heat, is applied, admits of ready demonstration by simple experiments. Thus, if a
small quantity of gun-cotton, wool, or thread be inserted and lightly presxed down into
a test-tube, and ignited by application of a hot wire to the gun-cotton, or of a sufficient
Source of heat to the exterior of the tube, it will ﬆmply flash into flame rapidly, with
but little indication of explosiye violence; but if it be preyiously exposed to a heat of
90” to 100* C., until it has attained that temperature throughout, its ignition, while at
that temperature, will be attended by decided evidence of greater explosive energy. * Phil.
