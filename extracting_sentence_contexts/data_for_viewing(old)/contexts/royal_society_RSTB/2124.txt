“"Qrith the horn hygroscope.

< Another fact noted by Scuwenvener, Lerrces, and Stan, namely, the closure of the stomata of
lea in winter, is easily verified. It is worth noting that in the warm winter of 1897-98 the
(Atomata were found clearly open on January 20 (temperature 12°), in the following :—

Prunus Lawrocerasus and lusitanica, Hedera Heli, Capsella Bursa-Pastoris, Cheiranthus Cheirt; the
hygroscope was at zero on Buxus sempervirens and Ilex Aquifolium.

Tn many leaves, especially those of Monocotyledons, the hygroscope readings vary in different parts
of the same leaf. Thus in Thalia dealbata the readings increased from 5 at the base, through 12 in
the middle up to 18 at the tip. In Agapanthus umbellatus four regions of the leaf from the base
upwards gave 0, 2, 7, 10. These facts, as already stated, are of importance in relation to’ the use of
the instrument, and show clearly the necessity of making no comparisons except between corresponding
parts of leaves. The same thing is true with regard to leaves of different ages, the hygroscope
readings on the stomatal side of young leaves are often considerably lower than on full-grown leaves.
