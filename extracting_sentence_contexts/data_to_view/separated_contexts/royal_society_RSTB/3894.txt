Summary or Carer Resuurs. A. The genetic identity between parent and offspring in parthenogenesis is
indicated by the following facts :â€”

(1) Ina polyclonal population of S. exspinosus the correlation coefficients between
individuals and their ancestors do not diminish as the scale of ancestry is ascended
(Table IV). (2) Ina monoclonal population the ancestral correlation coefficients for all degrees
tested are insignificant and fluctuate on both sides of zero (Table IX). (3) The offspring of a large number of pairs of parents, each pair belonging to one
clone, were compared, and it was found that the offspring of the larger members of
the pairs did not differ significantly from those of the smaller members of the pairs
(Tables V and X).
