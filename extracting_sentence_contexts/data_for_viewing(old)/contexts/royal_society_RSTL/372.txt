The young of the elephant, at its birth, is about 35 inches
high; and, as a knowledge of its progressive growth forms
the best criterion by which we can judge of the age of this ani-
mal, I shall here note down some observations made on this
subject, till the elephant has attained its full size; for, after this
period, till signs of old age appear, I do not know any marks
by which a tolerable guess can be made of the number of its
years, unless we could examine the teeth accurately; and, even
then, there would be much uncertainty.

Very erroneous notions have been entertained, with re-
spect to the size of elephants, in different parts of India; for
which reason, I have collected such facts as were likely to
ascertain their general height. The following observations, of

the gradual increase of growth, were made upon a young ele-
phant of Mr. STEPHEN Harris, which was accurately measured
from time to time, and upon a female elephant of my own,
till I left Tiperah.

Mr. Harris's elephant, at its birth, October 16, 1789, was 35
inches high.
