Section 4c described how learning in the form of ‘do

possible for individuals to learn from the behaviour
of others directly—learning in the form of ‘do what

them as cues as to what are ‘fit’ strategies, using both
the frequency of the behaviour [79] and the success
of the model (e.g. wealth, high status and health) as
guides [80].

We have some evidence that individuals do, in fact,
imitate the hygiene behaviour of the group (though
there are other effects here beyond blind copying).
A study monitoring handwashing with soap in a
motorway service station showed that it was more fre-
quent if there were several people present in the toilet
[81]. Similar effects have been found elsewhere [82].

Such blind copying can, of course be harmful.
A review of handwashing studies in 11 countries
found that handwashing with soap after defecation
was rare (17% observed to do so on average over the
studies). Respondents often claimed that handwashing
