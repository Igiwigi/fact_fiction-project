Sments were made in which this secondary oxidation was allowed to reach its limit. The
Detion of the air, which in presence of manganous salt, when the solution is let stand
for many hours, is apt to be considerable, was rendered as small as possible by boiling
Zout the water used and keeping the liquid under carbonic acid ; a correction for it was
Zils0 obtained from a comparative experiment. Tt appeared that the secondary oxida-
tion did not exceed one-sixth of the primary, and bore to it often a still smaller pro-
portion, while at the same time its amount was always sufficient to leave no doubt as
Nt the reality of the phenomenon. The available oxygen of the permanganate is. thus
Sinally distributed in two ways, part of it remaining in a form in which it acts gradually
Eon hydriodic acid, and another larger part having no such action. What oxidizing
Substance the colourless solution still contains, whether a less reducible salt of manga-
.2nese, or ome compound produced, as is most likely, by the gradual oxidation of oxalic
Sacid, we do not know; but the fact that some s8ubstance is formed besides a manganous
Zxalt, carbonic acid, and water, is certain. If, however, two products, or any number of
=different products, are formed by the action, according to different equations, of one
Soxidizing substance—binoxide of manganese, for example,—the quantities of this snb-
stance remaining after equal intervals of time should still be in geometric progression ;
for the amounts of each of the products which is formed at any given time is propor-
tional to the whole amount of binoxide present in solution at that time, and in conse-
quence the amount of binoxide which disappears owing to the formation of each of the
products is also proportional to the whole amount of binoxide present.

Let dy, dgy, . .. d,y be the amounts of binoxide which disappear during an infinitesimal
time dx, owing to the formation of n different products, then 2x, 5, 5 are the
amounts of binoxide which disappear in a unit of time owing to their formation, and
