brighter than that deposited from the same solution without that ingredient ; this bright
depoxit is not wholly metallic silyer, but contains a small proportion (about 1 per cent.)
of some other ingredients of the electrolyte.

I have not examined the laws or conditions that regulate the proportions of the sub-
stances that unite by this species of combination.

127. The substance formed in either of these solutions of antimony may be viewed as
\ a feeble chemical compound of metallic antimony with a salt of antimony : that it is
not a purely mechanical mixture is rendered very probable by the fact of its powder not,
" reddening moistened litmus paper, especially in the case of that obtained from the
"bromide solation, which contains as much as 20 per cent. of saline and acid matter,
; whereas immediately after the gradual change has occurred it has the power of redden-
ing litmus strongly (101.), and the alt of antimony contained in it may be much more
readily extracted by dilute hydrochloric acid (83.); these facts also indicate that, the
change is, at least in part, a case of chemical decompoxsition, the substances remaining
X together after the decomposition in a state of mechanical mixture.
S 128. The compound depoxited is evidently not a direct result of electrolysis, other-
2 wise it would be deposited in the proportion of its electro-chemical equivalent ; nor is it
Z a definite chemical compound, because there is no equivalent or atomic proportion
= between the quantity of metallic antimony and that of the salt with which it is com-
Â© bined, and because the proportions of these two ingredients are in each case somewhat
