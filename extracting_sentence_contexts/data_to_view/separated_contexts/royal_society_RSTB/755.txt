In fig. 233, taken


AND DEVELOPMENT OF APTERYX. 91

from the cartilage after removal from the body, the scapula appears to be nearly in
the same straight line as the coracoid, but in fig. 216, accurately reconstructed from
sagittal sections, it is seen to be strongly curved, so that while the coraco-scapular
angle, as usually taken, 7.c., considering the ventral end of the scapula only, is about
135째, it is only about 83째 if the general direction of the scapula is taken by a line
joining its base and apex. Fig. 216 certainly suggests the straightening of the
shoulder-girdle by its release from the backward pull of the shoulder muscles. Another striking fact is that the long axis of the coracoid (fig. 216, Cor.) is
inclined from its sternal articulation forwards, so as to make an acute angle with the
vertebral column, instead of a right angle as in later stages (cf fig. 204, Cor.). In
other words, the coraco-vertebral angle is about 35째, instead of 90째, and thus
furnishes an important point of agreement with the Carinate. Stages F and G (Plate 17, figs. 234-236).
