Mrmwunton as to the fact of the island of Rodriguez in the Indian Ocean having been
rmerly inhabited by a Didine bird specifically distinct from the true Dodo of Mauri-
us (Didus ineptus, Linn.) appears to have been first satisfactorily adduced in 1844 by

EM late Hugy Epwix STRICKLAND®, It is true that, eighty years ago, GMlay, in his

Klition of the *Systema Natur * of Linneus (tom. i. p. 728), described in scientific

finguage, from the account given by Le6varf (with which he was apparently acquainted

thly at second hand through the intervention of Bupeoxt), a second species of the genus

Widus as inhabiting that island ; but this species had been long rejected by all zoologists, Bxcept those whose labours had been confined to the work of compilation, until, as just

Hentioned, STRICKLAND proved, from a renewed examination of the original and other

-Fecounts, that the species thus described, however it might have been misrepresented,

Had certainly once existed, and moreover that remains of it were contained in at least
ree collections—the Museum of the Jardin des Plantes, the Andersonian Museum of

Blasgow, and the collection of the Zoological Society of London. = The opinion thus propounded was, four years later, et forth at greater length by its
thor, the subject of it being then declared not only specifically but generically distinct
om Didus ineptis, and called Pezophaps solitaria (Gmel.)g, and since that time no one
s ventured to impugn its accuracy.
