What may be another exposure of the same age as the Gaza Beds
is that reported by Champion (1937, p. 114) from the Lomogol Valley, for a specimen
received from him contains all three species of Mollusca found at Gaza. From the foregoing we find that the Omo Beds are to be assigned to the Lower
Pleistocene on account of the contained mammalian fauna, and that the Gaza are of
approximately the same age on the evidence of the molluscan fauna. Of the two it
may be that the Gaza Beds are the earlier on account of the fact that at some localities
at least the Omo Beds occur at a much lower altitude. That the part of the lake basin
in which both these series of deposits have been formed has undergone considerable
modification through earth movement is undoubted, for the Omo Beds themselves are
extensively faulted (see p. 255). The relationship of the Omo and Gaza Beds to some
others in Central Africa is shown in the Table (fig. 8).
