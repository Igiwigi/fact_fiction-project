chloric acid has not all the properties of hydriodic acid; soda has not all the properties
of potash ; chlorine is not the same as iodine; and sodinm is different to potassium. Is
it then to be a matter of surprise to us that peroxide of manganese has not all the
properties of peroxide of hydrogen ? is this case to have a special explanation ? and are
we to refer the different properties of these substances, not to the actual and known
differences in the elements of which they consist, but to an altogether hypothetical
and imaginary difference in the oxygen, which is the element common to the two bodies?
In each different compound, if such conyentional language be admissible, oxygen has
different properties; and if we are to account for this class of differences by the asxump-
tion of different varieties of oxygen, we must assume not two forms only, but an infinite
number of forms of that element. Of the precise mode in which the chemical pro-
perties of 'the compound are connected with the chemical properties of its constituents,
we are doubtless unable to give an adequate account. But the fact of this connexion
is not to be doubted. We take the oxygen of the peroxide of sodium, and transfer it
to the protoxide of manganese. In this new combination it will no longer produce the
effects of reduction. Again, we transfer the oxygen of the peroxide of barium to
anhydrous acetic acid, and we form one of the most powerful oxidizing agents with
which the chemist is acquainted ; while we can re-transfer this oxygen to baryta,
and restore to it its original properties. It is not the oxygen which is different, but
the elements differ with which the oxygen is associated.

The definite manner in which the final result is affected by modifying the conditions
of the reaction, is rendered evident by the following series of experiments.
