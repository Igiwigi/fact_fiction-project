easy to ausiver. A preliminary difficulty to be encountered is the complex physia=y
lowical chavacter of the two ongane ; and, apart fyom our toiperfect knowledge of the

physiology of the several functions assigned fo each, and especially in the cuse of the

internal ear of Fishes, a further difficulty is afforded hy the total absence of any

experimental evidence directly bearing on the functional siguifeanes of the Weberinty
ossicles. And, while we desire to emphasize the danger of making physiological
dedoctions from facts of a purely anatomical nature, 10 other course has yeb beey

adopted hy previous writers on this subject, and, ot present, this is the only one open

to us; consequently, any conclusions based upon data so frequently misleading and
unreliable must partake rather of the nature of suygestions, and be aecepted with

considerable reserve. With the qualification reridered necessary by these consider
tions, some Light miuy possibly be thrown on this dithewst problem by a careful inquiry
as to how far the Weberiun ossicles, and the coadapted parts of the aimbladder and
internal ear, ave anatomically fitted to uch as subsidiary or acvessory structiires in
conection with any of the several fanctions assigned to either the atr-bladder or
internal ear, while unsnited for association with others, By this means it may al
