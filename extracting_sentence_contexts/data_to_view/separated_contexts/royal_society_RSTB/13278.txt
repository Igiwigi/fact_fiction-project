The current coverage (table 1)
includes up to four of eight classes at the time of writing. The three classes that are covered by multiple genomes—
bivalves, gastropods and cephalopods—are the most familiar
molluscs and the most economically important. However,
these are not the largest classes: Polyplacophora in fact is
more species rich than Cephalopoda in terms of living species. Available genomes either represent interesting adaptive
features that capture the public imagination (for example the
scaly-foot snail and octopus, [10,30]), or species with impor-
tance for fisheries (for example oysters and scallops, [20,31]),
and potentially other economic impacts such as biomineraliza-
tion and bio-materials. There is a comparatively high number
of genomes in Pectinoidea (Pectinida + Ostreida), due to the
economic importance of these bivalves as well as the indepen-
dent origin of a dispersed visual system [32].
