April 26 and 27.â€”After an absence of a month from Kelly we again tested the
colour effect on April 26 and 27. We used wheels with 250 teeth and with 400
teeth, bright and s8moked, upright and inclined. We ascertained the fact that blue
light required the greater velocity of rotation to produce equality ; but we did not
make any actual measurements. We were unable to detect the snccessive phases of
colour which were observed on February 11. *
