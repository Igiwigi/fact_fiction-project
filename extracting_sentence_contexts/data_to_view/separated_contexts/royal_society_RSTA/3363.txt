In general, when conditions for resonant tunnelling are satisfied, one should expect that all the
configurations reachable by resonant transitions should be represented approximately equally
in the eigenfunctions. Thus, this picture predicts a sort of ‘thin ergodicity’ out to a distance at
least r(L), meaning that all configurations within an energy window (whose width decreases
exponentially with r) should be roughly equally represented in the eigenfunctions. In fact, larger neighbourhoods of the Griffiths region should be affected similarly, with ‘thin
ergodicity’ extending to arbitrarily large radii, in the idealized case of a single Griffiths bubble
in the whole of Z4. To see this, we need a bootstrap (or inductive) argument. To match up the
transition energy to the requisite accuracy for a spin at a large distance r from the bubble, we need
sufficient ‘digits of precision’ to represent the energy difference.
