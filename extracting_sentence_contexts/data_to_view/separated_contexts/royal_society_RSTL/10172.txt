The body always assumes nearly the same position, the dorsal
8ide (as determined by the interior structure) being held upwards and the buds extend-
Z ing horizontally on either 8ide. The anterior part of the main polyp, with its crown
2 of tentacles, is directed obliquely upwards and forwards. This position is maintained
S throughout all the following stages, and this is, I believe, a fact of the greatest import-
ance which stands in causal connexion with the bilateral syrmetry of the organism. The tentacles of the axial polyp may at this stage be entirely retracted into the
anterior part of the body. This is effected by the invagination of the oral end of the
body, the tentacles being at the same time strongly contracted.
