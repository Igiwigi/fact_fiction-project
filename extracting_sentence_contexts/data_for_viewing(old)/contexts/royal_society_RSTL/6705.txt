RADIATION OF HEAT BY GASEOUS MATTER. 81

air oscillate, but the ether does not s8well. We have here a definite picture before the
mind's eye, which, if the theory of an ether be true, is as certain as any conclusion of
mathematics, and would hardly be rendered more certain if the physical vision were 80
$harpened as to be able to see the oscillating atom and the fluid in which it swings. I
write thus strongly and definitely lest it should be imagined that T am dealing in vague
conjectures in connexion with this subject. If I am vague, the mechanical theory of an
ether must in reality bear the reproach. $0 far, however, from having a reproach to
bear, the whole body of facts is in complete harmony with this theory.

Further, if, as all the facts declare, radiation and absorption are complementary acts,
the one consisting in communication, the other in reception, and the one being strictly
proportional to the other, no coincidence in period between the vibrations of a radiating
body and those of oxygen, hydrogen, or air, could make any one of these snbstances a
good absorber. The form of the atom, or some other attribute than its period of oscil-
lation, must, enter into the question of absorption. It is physically incapacitated from
communicating motion, and hence in an equal degree incapacitated from accepting
motion. The neutrality of elementary gases in the experiments on absorption already
recorded does not arise from my accidentally choosing a source of heat whose periods do
not synchronise with those of the gas; for however they might synchronise, the gas would
8till be a bad absorber. Even when the motion which their own absorbent power does
not enable them to take up is mechanically imparted, or is communicated to them by
contact, they are till incompetent to expend it upon the ether, which accepts all vibra-
