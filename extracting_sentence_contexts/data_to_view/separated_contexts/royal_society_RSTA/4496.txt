Yet, as (02 - o?) - (ui - Ww) = 0.125 > 0, we would still prefer to confront f, rather than [8
f3. The WTP has gone up, even though the new distribution has a lower mean value of climate :3
sensitivity, more mass in the left-hand tail, and the same amount of mass in the right-hand tail. [8
That is because outcomes got worse in the middle. What at first glance might have appeared to
be ‘good’ news is, in fact, ‘bad’ news. This result holds if we change the most likely value of f3 to
any value higher than 3.2155°C, while leaving all other values unchanged, when 13 = 3.06°C.

(ii) Non-logarithmic utility

For non-logarithmic utility—values of y 4 1—the impact on the social planner’s WTP of moving
from f; to f; is more complex. This is because no natural damage function combines with
non-logarithmic utility to give a quadratic value function.
