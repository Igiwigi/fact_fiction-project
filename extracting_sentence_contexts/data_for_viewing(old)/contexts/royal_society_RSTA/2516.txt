The additional lemmas, appealed to on lines 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8, do not at all touch the central
considerations that lead to the fundamental lemma. That part begins with proving the structural
identity for chains c’ =’ U h{c’] of a subset b’ of a, where a is any system and h any function from a
to a. This general fact can be instantiated for the two chains c and c*; that fact, in turn, allows the
partitions used in the proofs of the fundamental lemma to define the bijections h* and h**. Here is a
diagrammatic summary:
