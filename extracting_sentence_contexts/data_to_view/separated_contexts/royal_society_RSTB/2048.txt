in the centre—a fact which demonstrates the general untrustworthiness of the
method. The stomata can only be well seen in stripped epidermis or thin surface
sections, but such preparations are especially liable to the source of error above

in spite of the general objections to this class of work, there is no doubt that much
valuable work has been done in this way.
