decrease in I equal to the secular change observed in an entire year.

The absolute magnitude of the non-cyclic change in I, as we see from Table X.,
does not vary very conspicuously with the season of the year, but relative to the
range of the diurnal inequality it is most important in winter. In January, in fact, it
averaged fully 30 per cent. of the range of the proper cyclic diurnal variation.

§ 17. The non-cyclic effect in H, see Table VII:, is as prominent as in I. Here also
it is increased by the contribution from the secular change, but 8 average quiet days
suffice to produce an increment in the force equal to the full secular change for the
year. The non-cyclic effect in H is on the whole wonderfully uniform throughout
the year, but it appears somewhat reduced at midsummer. Relative to the range
of the diurnal inequality, it is most important in winter; in January, in fact, it
averaged over 20 per cent. of the observed range.

In V, see Table VIIL, the non-cyclie effect is considerably less conspicuous than
in H or I, but more conspicuous than in D, There is a decided preponderance
of months in which it has the negative sign, and the mean annual value is positive
in only 2 out of the 11 years. According to Table X., the magnitude of the non-

cyclic eftect in V is considerably dependent on the season of the year, being greater
in summer than in winter. We have already seen that an appreciable though small
