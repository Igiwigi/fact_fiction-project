This hypothesis is borne out by
facts. When the vacuum is just good enough to allow the shadow to be seen, it is
very faint (owing to few molecular rays), but is quite sharp (owing to the divergence
of the molecules laterally). The variation in mutual repulsion is shown by the fact
that the focus projected from a concave pole falls beyond the centre of curyature, and
varies in position with the exhaustion, being longer at high than at low exhaustions.

589. Awning that the phosphorescence is due, either directly or indirectly, to the
impact of the molecules on the phosphorescent surface, it is reasonable to suppose that
a certain velocity is required to produce the effect. Within the dark space, ab a
moderate exhaustion, the velocity does nob accumulate to a gufficient extent to produce
phosphorescence ; but at higher exhaustions the mean free path is long enough to
allow the molecules to get up speed sufficient to cause phosphorescence.
