The observations made with this instrument gave me undoubted assurance
that the equation to the curye M N in fig. 11 is yz=a, a conic hyperbola, and that
the disposing force is inversely as the distance at which the flexion of the rays bent
and disposed takes place.

Scholium —It is clear that the extraordinary property we have now been examining,
has no connexion with the different breadths of the pencils at different distances
from the point of the first flexion, owing to the divergence caused by that flexion. By the same kind of analysis, which we shall use in demonstrating the 6th Propo-
Sition, it may be shown,—fzrst, that the divergence of the rays alone would give a
different result, the fringes made by an inflexion following a deflexion and those
made by a deflexion following an inflexion ; secondly, that in no case would the
equation to the disposing force be the conic hyperbola, even where that fringe de-
creased with the increase of the distance ; thirdly, even where the effect of increasing
the distance is such as the dispersion would lead to expect, the rate of decrease of
the fringes is very much greater in fact than that calculation would lead to, five or
Six times as great in many cases ; and /asly, that instead of the law of decrease being
uniform, it would, if caused by the dispersion, vary at different distances from the two
edges*, Nothing therefore can be more manifest than that the phenomena in ques-
tion depend upon a peculiar property of the rays, which makes them change in their
disposition with the length of the space through which they have travelled. It should seem that light may be compared, when bent and thereby disposed, to a
body in its nascent state, which, as we find by constant experience, has properties
different from those which it has afterwards; and I bave therefore contrived some
experiments for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not light at the moment of
its production (by artificial means) has properties other than those which it possesses
after it has been some time produced. This will form the subject of a future inquiry.
