THE MECHANICAL EQUIVALENT OF HEAT. 393

Tt should be noticed that on the above dates we were constantly passing currents
through the coil in order to adjust the temperature of the calorimeter during our
stirring experiments. As, however, there was but little current when ascertaining
the resistance of the wire at different temperatures, the: curves were not appreciably
altered, and we did not recognize the fact that the rise was a consequence of the
current. On August 27, we performed one of our “J” experiments. We then had
a current of about half ampére passing through the coil for about 14 hours.
