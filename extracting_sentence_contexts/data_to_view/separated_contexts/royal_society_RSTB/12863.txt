The moment they upgrade to a roomier shell, other crabs line up for
the vacated one [2]. One can easily see supply and demand at work here, but since it plays itself
out on a rather impersonal level it is not the barter or trade Smith had in mind. Hermit crabs are no deal-makers and in fact have no qualms evicting previous
owners by force. Barter is present in the primates, though. It is suggested by
reports on high-ranking male chimpanzees ‘bribing’ others by sharing meat
selectively with their allies [3], or raiding papaya plantations of a nearby village
to share the fruits overwhelmingly with fertile females [4].
