Understood to have evolved from a lineage of vertebral nonapeptides [1-3],
oxytocin was identified early as a hormone crucially involved in birth and lac-

oxytocin. Continuation on these lines of research revealed that oxytocin,
which can act as a neuromodulator in the brain [14-18], robustly affects
social behaviours in both humans and animal models [19-24]. In humans, oxy-
tocin has been shown to increase gaze to faces [25], improve the ability to infer
the mental state of others [26,27], enhance socially reinforced learning [28], and
possibly increase trust in social interactions [29-34]. In non-human primates,
oxytocin increases time spent looking at faces [35,36], improves socially
reinforced learning [37], increases the frequency of gaze following behaviours
[38] and promotes the donation of rewards to social partners [39,40]. Likewise,
