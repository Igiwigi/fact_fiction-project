Hence the resistance of the gas can be calculated
from the observed readings. Figure 5Â¢ shows the gas resistance plotted against pressure. The irregular waveforms for the gas current show that the gas does not in fact behave as
a simple ohmic resistance, and hence the values obtained above must be regarded as the
average resistance of the gas for the two cycles after breakdown, which was the region over
which the measurements were made. It is seen that the curves of resistance against pressure
are similar to the breakdown voltage curves. The minimum resistance, however, occurs at
a higher pressure than the minimum breakdown potential.
