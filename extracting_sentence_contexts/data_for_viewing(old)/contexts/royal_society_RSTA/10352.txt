9. Theory of Successive Changes.—Before considering the evidence from which
these changes are deduced, the general theory of successive changes of radioactive
matter will be considered. It is supposed that the matter A deposited by the
emanation changes into B, B into ©, C into D, and so on.

Each of these changes is supposed to take place according to the same law as a
monomolecular change in chemistry, 7.¢., the number N of particles unchanged after a
time ¢ is given by N = Nye~, where N, is the initial number and \ the constant of
the change.

Since dN/dt = — XN, the rate of change at any time is always proportional to the
amount of matter unchanged. It has previously been pointed out that this law ot
decay of the activity of the radioactive products is an expression of the fact that the
change is of the same type as a monomolecular chemical change.

Suppose that P, Q, R represent the number of particles of the matter A, B, and C
respectively at any time ¢#. Let ,, As, As be the constants of change of the matter
A, B, and C respectively.

Each atom of the matter A is supposed to give rise to one atom of the matter B,
one atom of B to one of C, and so on.

The expelled ‘rays’ or particles are non-radioactive and so do not enter into the
theory.
