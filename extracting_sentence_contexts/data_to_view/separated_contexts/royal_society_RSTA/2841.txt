Using a Lagrangian
formulation, Weber [21] employs a viscous model also to represent a MIZ—in this case for an
unlayered, rotating ocean. A viscous boundary layer model based upon the eddy viscosity in the
turbulent boundary layer beneath the ice cover has also been suggested [22-24], recognizing that
eddy viscosity is a phenomenological parameter to be determined as a function of flow conditions

rather than a physical measurable viscosity. These few papers collectively illustrate a reasonably : =

In fact, sea ice itself is viscoelastic, with different degrees of nonlinearity dependent on its 2
physical properties and environmental circumstances. At ocean wave forcing frequencies, first- aed
year sea ice itself is approximately anelastic [25], ie. any viscous deformation is recoverable, 22
which is a specific form of viscoelasticity where the hysteresis loop is closed. However, current [4
viscoelastic plate [26] and viscoelastic layer [15,27-29] models—the latter originally built to : >
synthesize the elastic plate [5] and viscous layer model [16], ignore this subtlety.
