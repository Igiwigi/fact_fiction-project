In the present state of our knowledge concerning the structure of Peripatus, the
most remarkable fact is the wide divarication of the ventral nerve-cords. The fact was
considered remarkable and dwelt upon in all mention of Peripatus before the exist-
ence of trachee in the animal was known, and when it was thought to be herma-
phrodite, but it is doubly remarkable now. The fact shuts off at once all idea of
Peripatus being a degenerate Myriopod, the evidence against which possibility is over-
whelming. The bilateral symmetry and duplicity of the organs of the body, the
absence of striation in the muscles, the absence of periodical moults of the larval skin
