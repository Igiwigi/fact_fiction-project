The mantissa of the satellite 23782
as found above was 4A,—60, above that of D,. Consequently its complete maritissa is
209A,—58, +, — (4A,—60,) = 205A, +4,+6, above that of f(1) or = 928A, or +4, or
+24,. Now this is soclose to the A, multiple as to point to the fact that this satellite
is the fundamental one, in which the rule is a multiple of A, for the mantissa when
there is no relative displacement with the second or third of the triplet satellite set. But here the observed », is 17992 = 179°50+°42 and ‘41 is the change produced by an
oun displacement. In other words the mantisse of the D,,, D., lines are either
M(A,), M(A,)+6, or M(A,)—6,, M(A,).
