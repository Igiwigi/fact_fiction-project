It is evident that
unless f” can be identified with A the value of w# calculated from (57) will be an over-
estimate (the case f <fis hardly probable). The temperature differences calculated from the readings of the resistance ther-
mometers, denoted by 6, and 6’,, differ from the true temperature differences @ and 6’
by amounts 36 and 46’ respectively, arising from the effect of kinetic heating already
mentioned. Although this effect is diminished owing to the fact that differential
readings of temperature are taken, the resonator thermometer registered an excess
of temperature over the valve thermometer owing to the fact that the former was
more exposed to air velocity than the latter. Writing 0, = 6—d0 and 6’, = 0’—d¢,
equation (57) becomes

w = JOM (6,—6’,)+JC,M [(so—00’)—(Ae—Ad’)]-(f—f’).. . «
