Here (in fig. 55) we find two
spirals, running in opposite directions, and interlacing at a certain point (Â«), in every
wind. This arrangement gives to the entire object a grooved appearance and a
flattened form. It is in fact the structure which, for want of a better term, I have
called a flat filament. The edge of this filament (figs. 114 3, 56 y, 62) presents what
at first sight seem like segments, but which in reality are the consecutive curves of a
spiral thread. A transverse section of snch an object is rudely represented by the
figure 8.
