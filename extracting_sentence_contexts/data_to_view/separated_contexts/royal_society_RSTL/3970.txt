arrow heads on the circle c; if the ray proceed from b to a, and

the eye be placed at a, the rotation will still be right-handed 70

the observer, i. e. according to the direction indicated on the
circle d. Let now an electric current pass round the oil of
turpentine in the direction indicated on the circle c, or magnetic
poles be placed $0 as to produce the same effect (2155.) ; the
particles will acquire a further rotative force (which no motion
amongst themselves will disturb), and a ray coming from a to
b will be seen by an eye placed at 6 to rotate to the right-hand
more than before, or in the direction on the circle c; but pass a ray from b to a,
and observe with the eye at a, and the phenomenon is no longer the same as before ;
for instead of the new rotation being according to the direction indicated on the cirele
d, it will be in the contrary direction, or to the observer's left-hand (2199.). In fact
the induced rotation will be added to the natural rotation as respects a ray passing
from @ to b, but it will be subtracted from the natural rotation as regards the ray
passing from þ to a. Hence the particles of this fluid which rotate by virtue of their
natural force, and those which rotate by virtue of the induced force, cannot be in
the same condition.

2233. As respects the power of the oil of turpentine to rotate a ray in whatever
direction it is passing through the liquid, it may well be, that though all the particles
possess the power of rotating the light, only those whose planes of rotation are more
or less perpendicular to the ray affect it ; and that it is the resultant or $um of
forces in any one direction which is active in producing rotation.
