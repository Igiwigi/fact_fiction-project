However,
this view is not universally accepted. Thus, Griffiths [18] calls the counterfactual meaning of
contextuality Bell-contextuality, and argues that any system is Bell-noncontextual (see Griffiths’s
paper in the present issue, [19]). This means that, in Griffiths’s opinion, it is always true that had
one measured a factually measured property in another context, the result would have been the
same; and that this has nothing to do with the existence or non-existence of joint distributions in
the first meaning of contextuality. The third way of defining (non)contextuality was historically the first. Contextuality (without
using this term) was introduced in quantum physics through the notion of hidden variables,
primarily by Bell [20,21] and Kochen & Specker [22].
