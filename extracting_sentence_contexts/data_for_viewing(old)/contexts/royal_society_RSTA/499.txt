and therefore different nanoflare frequencies. It must be remembered, however, that the observed
slopes have large uncertainties [24]. Cargill and co-workers [25,26] recently showed that the full
range of observed slopes can be understood if (i) nanoflares occur with a random distribution of
energies that obey a power law, (ii) there is a correspondence between the event size and the delay
between successive events, and (iii) the mean delay is of order 1000s, comparable to a cooling
time.

Viall & Klimchuk [27] have used a different approach to study nanoflare frequencies in the
diffuse corona. They developed an automated procedure to measure time lags in the brightness
variability observed in different channels of SDO/AIA. A large majority of pixels in the images
show clear evidence of cooling plasma, presumably in the aftermath of nanoflares, though not all
the plasma along the line of sight need be cooling. The time lags are seen even in channels with
widely separated temperature, implying that the nanoflares have low frequency. The fact that a
clear signal can be detected seems rather amazing when one realizes that the emission in each
pixel comes from many hundreds to thousands of unresolved strands. Modelling shows that the
technique is expected to see a cooling signature even with such extreme averaging [28].

Intermediate to high-frequency heating is needed to explain active region cores with steep EM
slopes. Low-frequency heating is needed to explain active region cores with shallow EM slopes
as well as the ubiquitous time lags. Both types of heating can be present along any given line of
sight, and the relative mix of frequencies can vary from one line of sight to the next and from one
active region to the next. The challenge is to explain both the slope and the time lag within the
same framework, possibly as proposed by Cargill and co-workers [25,26].
