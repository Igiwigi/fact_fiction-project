The remarkable performance of the model, especially before rather than to cumulative area (see appendix A). In particu-
visual experience, raises the recurring question of whether lar, the response profile of numerosity-sensitive neurons
numerosity comparison might in fact be carried out using (‘numerosity detectors’ in [24]) should be invariant to cumu-
low-level continuous visual properties as a proxy for discrete lative surface area: this is indexed by a large absolute value
numerosity [73-77]. Indeed, even if test stimuli are carefully for the numerosity regression coefficient and a small value
designed to control for continuous variables, simultaneously for the cumulative area coefficient. As shown in figure 5a,
controlling all of them is not possible [78]. numerosity-sensitive neurons were found even in the initial

To assess the influence of continuous visual cues in the network (n= 23), although their number significantly
