More or less elaborate: forms will be suitable according to the volume of the data.
Evidently these are considerations the nature of which may change greatly during the
work of a single generation. We may instance the development by PEaRson of a very
extensive system of skew curves, the elaboration of a method of calculating their para-
meters, and the preparation of the necessary tables, a body of work which has enormously
extended the power of modern statistical practice, and which has been, by pertinacity
and inspiration alike, practically the work of a single man. Nor is the introduction of
the Pearsonian system of frequency curves the only contribution which their author has
made to the solution of problems of specification: of even greater importance is the
introduction of an objective criterion of goodness of fit. For empirical as the specifica-
tion of the hypothetical population may be, this empiricism is cleared of its dangers if
we can apply a rigorous and objective test of the adequacy with which the proposed
population represents the whole of the available facts. Once a statistic, suitable for
applying such a test, has been chosen, the exact form of its distribution in random
samples must be investigated, in order that we may evaluate the probability that a
worse fit should be obtained from a random sample of a population of the type con-
sidered. The possibility of developing complete and self-contained tests of goodness of
fit deserves very careful consideration, since therein lies our justification for the free
use which is made of empirical frequency formule. Problems of distribution of great
mathematical difficulty have to be faced in this direction.

Although problems of estimation and of distribution may be studied separately, they
are intimately related in the development of statistical methods. Logically problems of
distribution should have prior consideration, for the study of the random distribution of
different suggested statistics, derived from samples of a given size, must guide us in the
