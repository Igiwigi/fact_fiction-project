The villi of the chorion are vesicles in which I observed objects having the appear-
ance of yesicles (Plate VIII. fig. 141.). The whole embryo indeed is composed of
vesicles (Plate VIII. figs. 121A. 121B. 122. bb!, and bb?,); and even the primordial germ
itself (Plate VI. fig. 113. bb.) seems to have been the nucleus of the vesicle in the
centre of which it lies.

297. I have now to mention a fact or two regarding the nature and properties of
nuclei, SCHLEIDEN SupPoses the nucleolus to exist before the nucleus, and ScuwanN
believes that he has obseryed the formation of the nucleus to take place around the
nucleolus. Hence the last-mentioned observyer considers that it may be said, © the
formation of the cell [yesicle] is only a repetition around the nucleus, of the same
process through which the nucleus was formed around the nucleolus;” the difference
being only in degree. In connexion with this yiew Scuwanv refers to the fact, that
nuclei often become hollow vesicles. On the period of origin of the nucleolus I haye
no observations, except that its existence was not appreciable in any of the nuclei re-
presented in Plate VII. figs. 120 and 121}, and not in all of those in Plate VIII. fig. 150.
Several observations, however, enable me to state that objects occupying the situation
of nuclei are sometimes hollow vesicles. Such for instance was their condition in the
amnion (Plate VIII. figs. 129. 130.) and in the lamina subsequently vascular (fig. 150F.).
I have also observed that with incipient decomposition of the peculiar granules
(vesicles) of the ovisac, their nuclei appear like vesicles, filled with a colourless and
pellucid fluid (Plate V. fig. 102. g.). Whether this results from distention of the
nucleolus (frequently seen to be hollow), or from liquefaction of the contents of the
nucleus including the nucleolus, I do not know.
