outreach and education [1]. CNGOs are important innovators and early adopters
in conservation science, policy and other practices, demonstrated by their develop-
ment and application of new tools, methods and approaches such as spatial

ecosystem monitoring systems (e.g. Ocean Health Index, [6]).

The CNGOs are increasingly interested in monitoring and evaluation (M&E),
parallel with (and influenced by) growing interest in M&E across the conserva-
tion sector [7,8]. CNGOs use a range of M&E approaches [9], including impact
evaluationâ€”the systematic process of assessing the causal effects attributable to a
project, programme or policy vis a vis a counterfactual scenario [10]. The counter-
factual is commonly established using a comparison group, or control, which is
identical to the population or site, but is not subject to the intervention. Impact
evaluations apply experimental (ie. randomized control trials) [11], quasi-
experimental (i.e. mimicking a counterfactual baseline as controls through statistical
methods) [10] or non-experimental designs with no control group using a simple
pre- and post-comparison [12] as well as advanced causal inference methods
such as structural equation modelling and Bayesian network analysis [13,14].

Impact evaluation is recognized as a valuable tool for retrospective examin-
ation of effects of past conservation efforts and prospective assessment of future
