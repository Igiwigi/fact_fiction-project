I therefore infer
that, 202 may be considered as a close approximation to the real equiyalent
of mercury. Before closing this communication, I will avail myself of the opportunity to
make a few remarks on the employment of filters. In so far, indeed, as re-
spects the experiments which haye been described in the present and preced-
ing Essay, the discussion is not very material, since most of the principal facts
have been ascertained by processes independent of filtration ; but in reference
to analysis in general, the subject is very important. In my own researches
I am in the habit of determining the weight of substances collected on a filter
in one of three different ways. One of these, introduced by Bzrzervs, consists
in burning the filter in a platinum crucible, and deducting the weight of its
ashes.
