DAWSON ON NITRAGIN AND

by certain observations which I made while studying the nature of the root-hair tube. In many root-hairs which had already reached their full size, tubes were present,
which had but just begun to grow down the hair, or had not yet penetrated through
its whole length. Similarly, in other fully formed hairs, infection had only just
oceurred, and the infection spot and inflated tip alone were evidences of the fact. On
the contrary, I have also noted several very small root-hairs, scarcely larger than the
cell from which they arose, penetrated by infection tubes which had already reached
and entered the outer layer of the root-cells. We are evidently confronted here by a difficult physiological problem as to the
conditions which regulate the entrance of these organisms.
