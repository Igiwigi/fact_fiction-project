At first sight it looks as though such a muscle would function by pulling
the terga together. But supposing these two plates were kept apart by some rigid fulcrum
above the muscle, then the latter, while pulling the lower ends of the plates together,
would at the same time pull outwards the upper parts. That this is what in fact occurs soon
became evident from the study of sections transverse to the terga and longitudinal to the

peduncle (figure 2). A fulcrum occurs which is formed by the carina and a modification
of the body wall. OF THE PEDUNCULATE BARNACLE LITHOTRYA 93

The outer covering of the peduncle consists of a relatively thick, laminated chitin layer
covered on the outside by a thin cuticular layer.* Towards the base of the peduncle the
cuticle is modified in places as little star-shaped nodules (Darwin 1851, p. 337), each of
which possesses a fine extension like a tail which runs through the chitin layer to the under-
lying ectoderm (figure 10).
