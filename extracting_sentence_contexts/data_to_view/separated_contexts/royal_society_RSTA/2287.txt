In many
woods both kinds will probably take place, but the first are most likely to occur in
homogeneous woods, and the second in light coniferous woods. § 24. Summary of Conclusions.—lt appears that the chief cause of the anisotropic
character of the elasticity of wood is to be found in the fact that wood is built wp of cells, of
which the majority are long hollow cylinders, arranged parallel to the grain. The exis-
tence of the medullary rays is also an important factor in producing this anisotropic
elasticity. Mathematical analysis shows that these two features of the structure of wood
are sufficient to account for (i) the fact that wood has, at any point, three planes of elastic
symmetry, and (ii) the numerical relations that exist between the three Youne’s moduli
and the six Porsson’s ratios which are implied by this symmetry.
