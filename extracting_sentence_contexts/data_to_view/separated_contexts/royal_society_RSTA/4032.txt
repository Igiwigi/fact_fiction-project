We will evaluate [log Ty (2 + @| @,, @) dz and [log Ty (2 + a| @, w,) dz. The method which will be employed is the same as that by which Raaseâ€™s formula

itself was originally obtained; it was, in fact, first invented for the proof of the
present theorem. Let
t (a) =["log T(z + a] a, w) dz. Then es tr Tye +2) E
