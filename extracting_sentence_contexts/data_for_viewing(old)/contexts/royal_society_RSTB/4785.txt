Four other egg-clusters produced 329 larve, entirely of the Progrediens type.
Steven (6) has obtained egg-clusters from Sistentes which hatched entirely to larvee
of the Sistens type.

Conclusions upon the Numerical Research,

Most striking is the fact that in all three types of parthenogenetic forms upon the
Larch—namely, Sexupara, Progrediens and Sistens—one type increases, as generation
after generation is produced, at the expense of one or other, or even both of the two
others.

First we see the Sexupara arising in very small numbers, and gradually increasing
from year to year in the first annual generation produced by the Sistens. Then the
Progrediens type makes its appearance in small numbers amongst the offspring of the
