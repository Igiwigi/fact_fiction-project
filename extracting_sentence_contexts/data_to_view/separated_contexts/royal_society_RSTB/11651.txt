The challenge for social
robotics is to determine how to incorporate such methods
into the sort of interactions needed for a particular deployment
context. For example, the current E2E (‘End-to-End’) NLG chal-
lenge [52] uses data drawn from a restaurant domain,
where the input consists of a series of facts about a restaurant. Any system trained on this sort of data would perform well
in a context where the robot must convey similar facts to its
partner; however, in contexts such as a home companion
robot, the robot utterances might be very different. In general,
as with all data-intensive techniques, the issue is obtaining
sufficient training data. It is not likely that current data-
driven NLG techniques can solve all social robotics generation
tasks—although given the success of such techniques, it would
still be instructive to learn how far they could be pushed.
