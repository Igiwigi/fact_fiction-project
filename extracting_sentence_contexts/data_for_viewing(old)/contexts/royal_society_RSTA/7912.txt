the “ keystone’ cannot “ fall’ into the denser underlying rocks further than its
equilibrium position where it is just “ floating’. The isostatic anomalies over the
floor of the Rift could not therefore be negative as they are, in fact, found to be. We
therefore conclude that the Rift has not been formed in this way.

WeEGENER* has suggested that the Rifts are rents formed by tension which have
been filled by matter rising from below. Tension can only thin the crust by stretching
it or produce cracks which are filled by heavier matter, it cannot produce more light
rock below sea level than was there before. This is shown by WEGENER’s fig. 35.
It is impossible, therefore, to produce a gravity deficiency over the Rifts by such a
process. This argument will apply to any tension theory of Rift formation.

It has been suggested by WAYLAND? that the Rift is due to compression, a wedged-
shaped block being forced down between reversed faults. This block, held under
by the plateaux on each side, will clearly provide an excess of light matter over that
