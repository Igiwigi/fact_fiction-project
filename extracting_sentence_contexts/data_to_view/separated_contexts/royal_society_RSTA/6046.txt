We have now seen that BvH theory can assign a score that reflects the functionality of a
sequence pattern without the need to fit any parameters. But in order to quantify the functionality
of sequences with significant correlations between sites, we have to go beyond that theory. We
now introduce a second-order PWM (as BvH in fact did in the appendix to [22], but for adjacent

monomers only)
(2) Po(si) )

Just as before, pjj(Sa, Sp) is the likelihood to find symbol combination sq, sp at the pair of sites i, j,
while po(sjj) is the likelihood to find the consensus pair there. Defining this matrix implicitly assumes that beyond monomers, any pair of monomers is in
statistical equilibrium as well. While assuming that even higher-order correlations are in statistical

3We changed notation slightly in equation (3.9), from pi(s;) in equation (2.8) to pi(sa) here, to conform to BvH theory.
