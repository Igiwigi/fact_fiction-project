After tapping (under any load up to
6 or 8 kilos.) the resumption of loading caused the E.M.F. to have a positive
maximum or negative minimum, and the resumption of unloading gave a positive
minimum or negative maximum, as in that figure. The molecular state produced by
brisk mechanical vibration is like that produced by applying the process of reversals,
at least in these particulars—that the traces of previous stress-changes are more or
less completely obliterated, and the next succeeding application or removal of stress
causes similar complex variations in thermoelectric quality.

$ 41. Attention has already ($ 13) been drawn to the fact that the characteristic
difference between © on” and © off” curves of load and thermoelectric quality is not a
mere lagging in the change of thermoelectric quality. If it were, a reversal, 8ay,
from unloading to loading would cause in the earliest stages no thermoelectric effect,
instead of causing (as it generally does) an effect whose sign is the same as that which
was previously occurring during the unloading. Tt occurred to the writer to inquire
whether this might not be accounted for as follows, by the instability of molecular
structure which, generally speaking, exists at any point in the process of loading or
unloading.
