When cross fertilization fails the position of the penis seems eminently suited
for self-fertilization, as inferred by Martin Saunt ANGE (54). As to exactly at what moment fertilization takes place I have little fresh evidence. Nusspaum (44) supposed at first that it occurs in Lepas before the formation of the
egg-sacs, and, therefore, while the eggs are still in the oviduct ; later, however (51),
he supposed that the ova were fertilized as they issued from the external opening of
the oviduct ; the fact that in the foregoing case of Lepas anatifera the ova of the
completely developed lamella went on developing quite normally, while those in the
small clump emitted on the other side did not develop further, though united together
2 by the gelatinous cement and placed in exactly similar conditions, tends also to show
that fertilization takes place in the mantle cavity. In all other cases (and these were
fairly numerous) where I obtained eggs of Cirripedes freshly laid they had already
commenced developing, and had evidently been fertilized. I am inclined to believe,
therefore, that the spermatozoa do not enter the oviducts, and that fertilization takes
place immediately after extrusion of the eggs, while the cementing material is still
quite soft and easily penetrable.
