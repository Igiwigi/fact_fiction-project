This second group has a smaller liquidity value for all t. (Online version in colour.)

Finally, figure 11 shows the liquidity L(f), as defined in equation (2.2), for the groups of trained
and untrained agents. As it can be seen, trained agents have always a lower liquidity value. This is due to the fact
that they choose not to interact when their wealth is sufficiently low. This result makes it clear that
even though the mechanism of tax redistribution is very effective at lowering the Gini index of
the system, when considering just non-rational agents, it does not motivate the agents to interact
and participate in transactions. The consequence is a stalled economy and higher inequality.
