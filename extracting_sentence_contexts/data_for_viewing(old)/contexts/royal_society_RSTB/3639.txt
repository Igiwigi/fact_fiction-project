perinuclear network as primary both in phylogeny and ontogeny. The perinuclear
network in the giant cells of Halla appears to be of great importance, if one may
judge from its position and relations, for it is closely associated with the nucleusâ€”
the controlling and active centre of the cell, and it is placed so as to be most
advantageously situated with regard to the substances which diffuse from the nucleus
into the cytoplasm. This chromophilous substance, though present in the general
cytoplasm, is nowhere found in such dense accumulations as in the perinuclear zone
with which the perinuclear network is so intimately associated. It would appear,
therefore, that this central network is specially situated with regard to the facility
for rapid nutrition and for experiencing the full benefit of its close proximity to the
nucleus. Some of the nerve elements described by Berne seem to afford ground for
accepting his view that the cell body in these cases may be regarded as being of
subsidiary importance, as, in fact, a lateral, perhaps merely trophic, appendage of the
conducting elements or fibres. But whatever may be the relative value of the cell
body and its processes in the case of certain crustacean nerve cells, I think no one,
after examining the giant cells of Halla and noting their large size and the high
degree of development of the neurofibrillar network and especially of the perinuclear

network, could doubt that, in this case, the cell and its contained fibrille form a
centre of activity which must exercise a profound effect upon the nature or potential
of the nerve wave which traverses this centre. This statement must not, however,
be taken as applying to the giant cells of all Annelids, for there are indications that
