The prediction of energy in the bands at resonance (i.e.
the directly driven bands, and those at integer multiples of the driving frequency) again
is accurate to within a few decibels; however, two distinct errors are present: (i) the SEA
methodology has a tendency to smear the energy across neighbouring frequency bands,
for example in case (c) the benchmark predicts frequency content in the seventh band,
while the SEA method makes a prediction that includes energy in both the seventh and
eighth bands; (ii) outside of the resonant bands the prediction is less accurate. Errors
outside of strongly driven bands are to be expected as the assumption of equation (2.9)
required that each frequency band contains resonant oscillators. A resonant assumption would
incorrectly predict the energy if the oscillators were in fact only weakly driven. Noticeably,
the nonlinear SEA results fall within the error bars of the bench mark code for the bands at
resonance.
