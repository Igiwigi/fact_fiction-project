left around the central fibre, which is of course gradually increasing in length also, I
think it doubtful if the entire cell rotates, because the central fibre does not appear to
be twisted ; but it is obviously possible that the outer portion of the cell might rotate
glowly round the inner portion without causing any twisting of the fibre, the mass of
which the cell is composed being in the natural state very soft and plastic,

It must be borne in mind that at first the two fibres of the ganglion-cell are parallel
to each other, and that the cell while altering its position continues to grow. As the
cell moves away, its fundus or large extremity preceding, the fibres projecting from it
increase in length—are drawn out, as it were. There is a fact in fayour of rotation which I have observed s0 often that it may be
regarded as constant—that, in peripheral parts where a dark-bordered fibre is being
Sdeveloped, a fine fibre passes spirally around it; and this may be accounted for in pre-
© cisely the same way as I have attempted to explain the production of the spiral fibre of
>the ganglion-cells. The arrangement described is represented in figs. 29 & 30.
