At the time of recording the above obseryations, I was not aware that such an idea
had been published. I shall be glad if those observations are 8uch as to confirm it. There is one fact men-
tioned by Owev which I think particularly deserving of attention here. In describing the blood of a cold-blooded
animal—the Monitor—he remarks, © many of the discs had the marginal contour slightly crenate, with lines
converging to the nucleus.” —The appearance of the blood-dise when undergoing the changes which we have
seen to terminate in a separation into globules, seems to have been noticed by several observers; among whom
may be mentioned Hewsox and FaLcovar, and more recently Hopoxiv and Lisrer.
