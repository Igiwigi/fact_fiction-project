It seems also necessary to add, that the light of the seyeral belts differs greatly
in intensity ; some being composed of closely crowded and very brilliant streamers,
and others of a few feebly-lighted, ill-defined ones. It is now apparent, from the description, that the streamers are not phenomena
distinet from the arches, but that the latter are just aggregations of the former within
certain stereometric spaces, whose bounding planes bear definite relations to the lines
of magnetism of the earth. In the letter to the President of the Royal Society I
named these aggregations fringes; and, in fact, they resemble long fringes composed
of threads, the threads being represented by the individual, nearly vertical streamers,
or lengthened narrow straight pencils of rays of light. 'The length of these filled ste-
reometric spaces, at right angles to the magnetic meridian, is often very many miles,
extending over head, when they come to the zenith, from the east to the west horizon,
although they are frequently cut short in this dimension. Their depth in a nearly
vertical direction, or more properly in the plane of the magnetic dip, is determined
by the length of the individual streamers that fill them. This length of the streamers
seems to vary considerably; as some of the arches at about 45* elevation may be s8een
about 20 broad from north to south, and others 30* and upwards.
