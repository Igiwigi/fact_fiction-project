amygdala and direct or indirect inputs from the insular cortex (figure 2), both of which are
also involved in generating responses to physical stressors [35,72]. Furthermore, air-puff stress
induces an increase in c-Fos expression (a marker of neuronal activation) in the RVMM, but
not in the RVLM, which, as mentioned above, is activated when cardiac sympathetic activity
is reflexly increased by inputs from peripheral receptors [51]. The RVMM contains more SON
than any other brain region [50]. The descending pathway from the DMH to the RVMM is


functionally asymmetric, such that disinhibition of the right DMH induces significantly larger
decreases in HP and increases in cardiac contractility and number of ectopic beats than those
evoked from the left DMH [75]. Thus, the pathway from the right DMH to the RVMM may
contribute to stress-related increases in cardiac sympathetic activity [75], which is a main cause of
malignant tachyarrhythmias [76], and further explains the fact that intense emotional stress can
cause sudden death (see, for example, [77]), as also discussed in ยง2d(iv). Finally, vagally mediated
heart rate variability may also decrease with stress, and according to a remarkable meta-analysis
of neuroimaging studies may index the extent to which threat representations encoded in the
amygdala are inhibited by the ventral MPFC based on the external and internal perceptions of
safe contexts [47].

The transition from wakefulness to non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep brings about : =
an increase in HP [78], which is attributed to an increase in parasympathetic activity [79]. On [3
passing from non-REM sleep to REM sleep, which accounts for approximately 20% of total : =
sleep time, HP generally shows a mild tonic decrease, which is superimposed on large transient Da
changes in HP associated with bursts of rapid eye movements, phasic increases in the activity of : re
