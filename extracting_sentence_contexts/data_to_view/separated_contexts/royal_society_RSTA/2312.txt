Also, an analytical solution for the solitary wave in an
arbitrary extensible helical fibre was obtained [15]. It was shown that the extensibility manifests
itself when the energy of the wave is high.

(b) Binary wave

Meanwhile, a question arose as to how the helix would respond to a suddenly applied axial
tension force. The peculiarity of the situation was the fact that under this load, the helix, due
to its geometry, should rotate about the longitudinal axis, but at the same time, there was no
axial moment applied. This contradiction was resolved by the formation of a binary wave arising
in the helix, where one part of it rotates in one direction, while the other switches in the other
direction, so that the total angular momentum remains at zero [16]. Another type of binary wave
was discovered much later [17], ยง8e.

(c) Binary crack

Dynamic lattice fracture and phase transition exhibit some surprising phenomena.
