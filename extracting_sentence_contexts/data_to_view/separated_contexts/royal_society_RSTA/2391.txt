17. The simplicity of the formulation depends on the fact that the invariant
factors of 8~a—y are linear. We have obtained this by assuming that the form ap*
only vanishes when every element of p is zero, But the invariant factors may be
linear when this is not so, and the roots of the determinantal equation are not pure
imaginaries. For instance, take Hri1’s equations for the motion of the moon, under
certain limitations,
