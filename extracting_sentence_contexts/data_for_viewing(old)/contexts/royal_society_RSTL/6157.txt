and its ally, starch.

In making a quantitative determination of this material in the liver, I have availed
myself of its properties of resisting the action of a boiling solution of potash, and of
being precipitated by spirit. The following results were obtained by pounding a piece
of weighed liver with potash, adding a little water, and boiling some minutes until all
was completely dissolved. The liquid was then poured into about six times its volume
Â» of 8pirit, by which the amyloid substance was thrown down as a white floceulent pre-
cipitate. The precipitate, after bemg well washed with spirit, was dried and weighed.

The size of the liver is to a most striking extent influenced by the nature of the diet ;
and the alteration that is thus induced is chiefly, if not entirely, due to the amount of
amyloid snbstance/ present. TI was first conducted to the discovery of these facts, whilst
in my early experiments I was seeking to determine if the quantity of sngar found in
* the liver and blood of the dog after death was altered from its ordinary amount by the
previous administration of a strictly vegetable diet. The process I then adopted for
examining the liver was to remove and weigh it, and then to pass a stream of water
through its vessels until its tissne was completely deprived of sugar, After a vegetable
diet, T noticed, first, that the liver was of enormous size, in comparison with what IL
had been accustomed to meet with under an animal diet; and secondly, that there was
a remarkable quantity of a material present which much interfered with my analysis,
and which I sabsequently found to be amyloid substance.

In all the observations that follow, the life of the animal was suddenly destroyed, its
body then opened, and the liver removed. The liver thus circumstanced immediately
