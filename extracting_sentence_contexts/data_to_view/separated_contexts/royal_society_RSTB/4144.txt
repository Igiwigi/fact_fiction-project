evident, they continue, that in the life-
history of Paramacium, periodically, a dynamic reorganisation occurs, either by
endomixis or by syngamy. Lastly, while endomixis is not regarded as exactly
comparable with parthenogenesis, for instance, both are nevertheless apokaryomictic
phenomena, which must be contrasted with karyomictie ones such as conjugation. If, therefore, endomixis is still necessary for the continued existence of a race of
Parameciuin, which is (artificially) prevented from conjugating, does not this fact still
further diminish the value of any generalisation that syngamy is not an essential
process! For, according to the opinion of the authors themselves, endomixis is
only a variant of conjugation, both processes having a similar function ; and emphasis
is laid upon molecular rearrangement as the result common to both. I am strongly of opinion that it is in this direction that we must look to find the
primary cause of, or reason for, syngamy.
