surface nearer to the observer.

though the vertical portion of the T is so shortened as to be nearly absent. The
nucleus lies excentrically on the hinder (outer) side of the cell, and this is especially
clear in young animals (figs. 18, 19, Plate 42). On the anterior (inner) side of the
nucleus there is a curious pathway of axoplasm connecting the axon with the dendrites

(figs. 18, 19, Plate 42), this representing the horizontal arm of an ordinary T-shaped
neuron. The bipolar shape of the cell is therefore a result of the fact that it has grown to
such a size that the cell body can no longer be contained within the outer cell layer.
The neighbouring neurons of the lobe, though never as large as the giant cell itself,
often show a tendency to leave the cell layer (fig. 4). Evidently the morphogenetic
