STRUCTURE OF A SPECIES OF MILLEPORA. 131

ment of the tentacles, and in the nature of the thread-cells*, MMillepora seems to
resemble 8nch a form as Gemmaria implexa. The real affinities of Millepora amongst
the Hydroids cannot, however, be determined until the mode of reproduction is dis-
covered. It is a remarkable fact that the corallum of Millepora seems undoubtedly to be gene-
rated by the ectoderm. In Anthozoa this is not the case, the corallum being developed
from a mesoderm, as appears certain in the latest accounts of the matter from M. Lacazre-Durnrens'sF researches on Astroides calyeularis, and from those of KowaLewsky{
on Astraa and on Aleyonium digitatum.
