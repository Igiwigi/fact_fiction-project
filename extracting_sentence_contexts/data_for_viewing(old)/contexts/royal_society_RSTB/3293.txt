epidermis (B), with the exception of a few short rows at the base of the lower
surfaces (c), The faleate form of the leaf of the broad base is shown in fig. 20, p.
In the other Eutacta species stomata usually occur over the whole of the epidermis.

Sect.: CotymBprea, Araucaria imbricata.—The cotyledons exhibit a well-defined
differentiation into palisade and spongy parenchyma. Hypodermal fibres occur below
the upper and under epidermis. The vascular bundles are usually accompanied by
fairly abundant transfusion-tracheids in a form of a conspicuous are above the
centrifugal xylem. The resin-canals alternate with the veins, but occasionally
a canal is seen underneath a vascular bundle. The leaves of the seedling differ
from those on the older shoots chiefly in their softer texture, due to the comparatively
feeble development of mechanical elements. We noticed that the transfusion tracheids
in the apical region of a young leaf constituted nearly the whole of the xylem, a fact
in accordance with BERNARD’s description of this tissue in the leaves of Agathis.

The mature type of leaf is characterised by numerous short and broad ribs of
hypodermal fibres below the upper epidermis comparable to those in leaves of
Cordaites. The mesophyll in some leaves is almost uniform in structure, while
in others it exhibits a differentiation into palisade and loose parenchyma, the former
tissue being represented on both faces. Contrary to Brerrranp’s statement,{
numerous large and lignified idioblasts are scattered through the mesophyll. The
mesophyll in this and other species contains a considerable number of thin-walled
and clear cells which probably serve as water reservoirs, The vascular bundles are
