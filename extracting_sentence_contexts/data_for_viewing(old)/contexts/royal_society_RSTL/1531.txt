escape, acquires a higher level, $0, in a place where it can
escape, the same operation produces a current: and this cur-
rent will extend to a greater or less distance, according to the
force with which it is set in motion ; or, in other words, ac-
cording to the height at which it is kept up, by the wind.

It may possibly be asked, why a similar current does not
prevail in the British Channel, from the same westerly winds?
To this I answer, that the increased height and velocity of
the tides, during the prevalence of such winds, prove that a
part, at least, of the same effect which happens in the Bay of
Biscay, is produced in the Channel ; and I have little doubt,
that there is, in fact, a current also ; but that, as it is blended
with the common tide, the effect on the senses is lost : for it
may appear only in the form of a stronger flood tide, or a
weaker ebb, than at other times. Whereas the Bay, a wider
Space, and of a different form, allows a freer scope to the
tides, than the British Channel does : it being high water
nearly at the same time, all over the Bay ; but varying in
the Channel, at least five hours. And it may be concluded,
from analogy, that the form of the Channel does not allow of
the same effect being produced by the wind, on its included
waters, as may be produced on those of the Bay : these meet-
ing with an opposition, in the coast of France, the others
having a partial exit, at the Strait of Dover : we may also
