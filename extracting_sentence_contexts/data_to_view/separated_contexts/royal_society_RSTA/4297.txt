Moreover, for these organisms, the fitting parameters are very similar, with a characteristic length
ranging from 200 to about 300 bases (from a minimum of 214 for Equus to a maximum of 294 for
mouse). The only exception is Monodelphis, which has a characteristic length of 452, nearly double
the others. This may be due to the fact that in this organism CpG autosomal density is very
different from the other amniotes (0.9% versus 1.7-2.2% [44]). For the other group of organisms,
once again, the situation is more heterogeneous: for example, for Apis and Danio, the exponential
function seems to fit the empirical data well (?? = 0.98, x2 = 0.1) and also the characteristic lengths
are comparable with the ones of the first group (A = 296 and 299, respectively), while Drosophila
and Saccharomyces have very good fits (r? > 0.99, x? ~ 0.1 for S. cerevisiae), but their characteristic
lengths differ by an order of magnitude (A = 44 and 37, respectively). For the other organisms, :
the exponential distribution seems unfit, even if with a heterogeneous degree of dissimilarity (see :=

electronic supplementary material, figure S2, for a visual inspection).
