Rebinding of MinE to the MinD-—MinE attachment
recruitment. The recruitment of MinD shifts the attach- zone at the tip of the polar zone is favoured owing to the
ment—detachment balance towards further attachment. By faster recruitment of MinE and the fact that MinD is tempor-
contrast, the recruitment of MinE shifts this balance towards arily inactive after detachment. This leads to the progressive
detachment. The structure of a polar zone is such that MinE is conversion of attachment zones into detachment zones
accumulated in the form of MinDE complexes at its rim owing to the shifting balance in favour of MinDE complexes
(sometimes called the ‘E-ring’), whereas MinD accumulates (detachment) (figure 5).
