FISH provides one of the most solid 2 6 ‘3
approaches to visualizing natural mixotroph-prey inter- FI & 2
actions when used with fluorescent prey or dual probes, °1O
one hybridizing to the mixotroph and the other hybridizing e
to the prey [75]. This technique has demonstrated prymnesio-
phyte algae as important bacterivores, followed by (b)

knowledge of the predator and prey, if specific probes are z —_
