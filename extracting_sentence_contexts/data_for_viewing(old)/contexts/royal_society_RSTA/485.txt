measurement gives a fracture toughness in terms of Jjc using the standard of 175kJm~?. For
comparison the initiation toughness, J;, was also calculated using following relationship [23]:

Ji= F-%9COD). (3.1)

The factor d,;, depending on stress state and strain hardening coefficient was taken to be 0.78,
which is typical for a non-hardening material and characterizes the deformation behaviour of
UFG materials at larger strains well. The reference stress o9 is the average of yield and ultimate
strength. J; was calculated to be only 7.6 kJm~ and inserted into the J â€” Aa plot in figure 5. It is
clearly visible that the calculated J; corresponds well to the value that would be assumed from
the J-resistance curve in the figure. What is different to most coarse-grained ductile materials is
the steep increase of J after crack initiation. A similar trend in the J-resistance curve behaviour
was also observed for UFG Ti [24]. The much higher Jjc can be explained by the fact that its
definition per the ASTM standard allows a stable crack advance up to 0.2mm, whereas J; defines
the first physical crack advance. The further steep increase is also somewhat surprising, because in
coarse-grained material the slope would normally flatten out. Another reason for the steep slope
was found with fractographic observations, which showed a pronounced crack path tortuosity
leading to local re-blunting processes and thus to a strong increase in the local COD with almost
no crack advance. For the CG copper, a J-resistance curve and Jjc could not be measured because
of the very low strength of the material.


For a direct comparison with other materials very often critical stress intensities are demanded. 8 |
