involved: [38] is algebraic and combinatorial, [60] is representation-theoretic, and [61] is
cohomological.

In their unpublished work, Kang and J-K Yu obtained a similar identity for n > 4 involving
Z,(Xu) for l1<r<n—-1.

(c) Ramanujan and strongly Ramanujan complexes

Motivated by the Ramanujan conjecture, a Ramanujan complex arising as a finite quotient of
the building B,,r is defined in §4b in terms of the Hecke operators, or equivalently, adjacency
operators on vertices. To see this from the viewpoint of zeta functions as we did in §3d for
graphs, as shown in theorem 6.1, for n>3 other operators also appear in the zeta function.
In fact, adjacency operators on r-dimensional simplicies for each 0 <r<n—1 would appear.
It is natural to ask whether the temperedness condition holds for each r and how they affect
each other.


For n=3, Kang-Li-Wang proved in [60] that a finite quotient Xr of B3r is a Ramanujan
complex if and only if the non-trivial spherical representations in L?(7\PGLa(F)) are tempered
(by definition), which is equivalent to the non-trivial parahoric representations in L?(7\PGLa(F))
being tempered, which in turn is equivalent to the non-trivial Iwahori-spherical representations
in L?(P\PGL3(F)) being tempered. We note that a spherical representation is parahoric,
and a parahoric representation is Iwahori-spherical. This holds true in general: among the
representations in L?(7\PGLn(F)) which occur in the zeta function of the finite quotient
Xr =I°\By,F, spherical representations contain non-zero vectors fixed by the maximal compact
