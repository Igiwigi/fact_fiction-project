Here a pronounced effect of stochastic fluctuations (caused by the atmospheric temperature
and fluid friction velocity) on the crystallization dynamics is studied. The rapid unpredictable
stochastic changes in different system parameters lead to the unusual noise-induced solidification
scenarios in the mushy layer as well as at its boundaries, ‘solid phase-mushy layer’ and ‘mushy
layer-liquid phase’. One of the main conclusions following from this research article consists in
the fact that the presence of noise drastically changes the mushy layer dynamics compared with
the classical deterministic scenario [50,51]. This paper presents an area of research in the nonlinear
dynamics of crystallization processes—a phenomenon of stochastically induced shifts of different
dynamical dependencies in a mushy layer. The evolutionary theory of the curved solid—liquid interface, which, in many cases, precedes
the mushy layer appearance, is analysed in the concluding overview [52].
