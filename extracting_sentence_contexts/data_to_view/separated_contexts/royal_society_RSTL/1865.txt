Portal-yvenous congestion is of very rare
occurrence ; I have een it in children only. In this form, the congested sub-
stance never assumes the deep red colour which characterizes hepatic-yenous
congestion ; the interlobular fissures and spaces and the marginal portions of
the lobules are of a deeper colour than usual; the congested substance is con-
tinuous and cortical, the non-congested substance being medullary and occu-
pying the centres of the lobules. (Plate XXI. fig. 4.) The second stage of
hepatic-yenous congestion, in which the congested substance appears, but is
not, cortical, may be easily confounded with portal-venous congestion. The physiological deductions arising out of the preceding anatomical facts
are extremely simple. If it could be shown that two substances exist in the
liver, it might be fairly presumed that this organ executes two functions ; but
each lobule being, in itself, a perfect gland, and of the same structure through-

It _ been shown that all the vasa yasorum of the liver are branches of the
hepatie artery and portal vein ; that branches of the Portal vein arise in the
coats of the hepatic veins themselves; and that the veins of the coats of the
vessels constitute the hepatic origin of the portal vein. The arterial blood
having circulated through the coats of the vessels, becomes venous, and is
conveyed by the veins arising in the coats of the vessels into those branches of
the portal vein which correspond to the vessels in the coats of which the veins
arise: thus, from the coats of the vaginal ducts, veins and arteries they con-
vey the blood into the vaginal veins; and from the coats of the interlobular
ducts, veins and arteries into the interlobular veins.
