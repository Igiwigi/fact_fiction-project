him) that was different from the Alexander polynomial (Jones 1985). Crucially,
it was chiral, that is, it could distinguish knots from their mirror images, which
the Alexander polynomial could not. It soon emerged that this new invariant
was part of a grand family of invariants based on Lie algebras and _ their
representations.

The Jones polynomial emerged from a mysterious background of mathematics
and physics and seemed to fit into no general framework. But shortly afterwards,
Witten showed how to interpret the Jones polynomial in terms of a quantum field

heory in three dimensions (Witten 1989).

In fact, this relation between knot invariants and particles goes to the very
yeginning of relativistic quantum field theory as developed by Feynman and
others in the 1940s. The basic idea is that, if we think of a classical particle
moving in space-time, it will move in the direction of increasing time. However,
within quantum theory the rules are more flexible. Now a particle is allowed to

ravel back in time. Such a particle going backwards in time can be interpreted
as an anti-particle moving forwards in time. Once it is allowed to turn around,
he trajectory of a particle can form, as it were, a complicated knot in space
ime. The rules of quantum theory will associate to each such trajectory a
orobability amplitude that describes the likelihood of this process actually
aking place.
