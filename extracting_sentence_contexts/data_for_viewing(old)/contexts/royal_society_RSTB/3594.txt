mentary “inner flesh” and of the nucellus are bounded by a well-defined,
well-preserved epidermis layer. In this, our only longitudinal section, there is
no sign of a pollen chamber, but, as can be seen in Phot. 12, Plate 3, the nucellus
and endosperm project upwards into the base of the micropylar canal. This suggests
two alternative possibilities for the structure of this region of the seed, the relative
merits of which we cannot actually determine until we have more specimens. They
are: either that the seed had passed the stage of pollination and that the growing
tissues of the endosperm had crushed back the pollen chamber, which was presumably
small, and are filling the whole available space in the integument ; or, on the other
hand, that the apical portion of the seed had a beak-like conical projection, within
which lay the pollen chamber, which would be presumably rather small. If the seed
were cut slightly obliquely, the section would escape such a pollen chamber and yet
give an appearance of cutting the base of the micropyle ; such a section, in fact, as the
one we have. e

The Nucellus.—In nearly all sections some of the cells of the nucellar tissue are
preserved, and several specimens show a fine, large-celled tissue, instead of the
crushed black line that so often represents the nucellus in fossil seeds. Something of
this can be recognised in Phot. 11, Plate 3, but the detailed drawings in fig. 8,
Plate 1, and text-fig. 12, show it more clearly. The best preserved part of the
nucellus is the epidermis, which covers it entirely down to the base, where leaving
about 2 mm. of the nucellus in contact with the soft tissues of the inner flesh, it is
continuous with the epidermis of the latter. The cells are shown in longitudinal
direction in fig. 8, Plate 1, where they are seen to be rather long, about 0°08 mm. by
0°02 mm., arranged with their long axes in the same direction as the long axis of
