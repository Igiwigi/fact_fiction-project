were either one or, at most, two years old. I als» made use of some museum spe-
cimens, but decided to reject the results I obtained. with them, as. I had reason to
believe that in many cases those results were abnormal, As regards their favourable
or unfayourable character as material for showing the perforation of the cell-wall by
protoplasmic threads, seeds greatly differ one from another. In the firsb place, it
may be stated, as a general rule, that the thicker the pit membrane the easier can
the threads be distinguished. In very thin pib membranes the observation of 8uch
threads as may cross it requires great precaution and care; there is nothing, 80 to
peak, for the eye to catch upon, and one has to detect a line within a line. Tt is
this very fact that causes endosperm tissue to be 80 favourable for 8uch an investi-
gation as the present one ; for here, nob only, as a rule, are both the cells and the
pits unusually large, but, what is much more important, the pit membranes are
thick. In many cases, however, this is not the case, and an examination of sueh-
examples as Manicaria, Mauritia, or Caryota is quite sufficient to prove that the

extreme difficulty ; and it also serves to show that in other cases where the pits are
