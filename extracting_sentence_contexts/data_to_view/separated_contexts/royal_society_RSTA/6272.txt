It can also be clearly seen from figure 7 that for all admissible speeds of bridge crack failure the
parameter a is less than 1. As a consequence, if the horizontal links inside the chain are assumed
to have the same strength as the vertical links, all admissible bridge crack regimes are realizable
in the structures considered. Here, our conclusions are based on the fact that all links in the structure possess the same
strength. The results leading to these evaluations use the solution from [36], which gives
the profile of the chain during steady bridge failure regimes. These profiles are obtained
independently of any information on the behaviour of vertical odd-numbered links and
horizontal links through, for instance, 6 and w, respectively.
