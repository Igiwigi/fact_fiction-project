Therefore, trehalose is often used to prevent freezing
of water at low-temperature applications, e.g. cell preservation or freeze-drying. Since hydrogen
bonds are relatively strong molecular interactions, we classify A as following in a first attempt:

Figure 4. Plot shows relationship between limiting fictive temperature of the carbonate—water solution as a function of the : _
carbonate weight fraction. Increasing water content in the carbonate glass results in decreasing glass transition temperatures. iy
Data are fitted by Gordon—Taylor equation [40]. Glass transition temperature of pure water is taken from Hallbrucker et al. [35] im
and Capaccioli & Ngai [36].
