Wilson (1925), too, has said that ‘the physiological
anatomy of the individual cell falls into the background. ..and the apparently composite
character which the multicellular organism may exhibit is owing to a secondary distribution
of its energies among local centres of action’. Earlier, both Hofmeister and Sachs had
maintained that organ growth in plants is the primary fact and cell formation only of
secondary significance, while Whitman (1893), supporting this view, pointed out that ‘for
the same purpose’, e.g. the formation of an organ, one, several, or many cells may be used. The truth of this statement becomes apparent when the apices of different classes of vascular
plants are compared. But while it may be maintained that the apex functions as a whole,
the terminal apical meristem, with its initial cells or layer of cells, is indispensable to the
harmonious and orderly (i.e. the ‘normal’) development of the axis and its appendages.
