possible then, we say, that there can be any correspondence
between the general act of respiration, and the rolling of the
eye? Led thus to make the experiment, I was gratified to
find it s0 easy to give the proof. On stopping the nostrils
with the handkerchief, every effort to blow the nose will be
attended by a rapid rising of the cornea under the upper
eyelid, And on every occasion when the eyelids suffer con-
traction through the agency of the respiratory nerve of the
face, as in sneezing, the eyeball is rolled upwards through
the agency of the fourth nerve.

I might, perhaps, be satisfied with having made the obser-
vation of these two facts ; first, that there is such a combi-

combine to one effort, but also that relation between the classes of muscles by which
the one relaxes while the other contracts. I appended a weight to a tendon of an
extensor muscle, which gently stretched it and drew out the muscle ; and I found
that the contraction of the opponent flexor was attended with a descent of the
weight, which indicated the relaxation of the extensor. To establish this connec-
tion between two classes of muscles, whether they be grouped near together, as in
the limbs, or scattered widely as the muscles of respiration, there must be particular
and appropriate nerves to form this double bond, to cause them to conspire in
relaxation as well as to combine in contraction. If such a relationship be es-
tablished, through the distribution of nerves, between the muscles of the eyelids and
the superior oblique musele of the eyeball, the one will relax while the other
