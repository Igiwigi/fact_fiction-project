Such models have recently attracted a considerable amount of attention due
to the fact that various phenomena, including cracks, are successfully described. In the classical
linear elasticity theory such nonlinear response cannot be explained. The advantage of implicit
theories is that they allow for the gradient of the displacement to stay small so that one could
treat the linearized strain, even for arbitrary large values of the stress, which has, in fact, been
observed in many experiments (see the references in [3]). In this work, we are interested in the analysis of a one-dimensional viscoelastic model resulting
from a constitutive equation specifying the relation between the linearized strain, the stress and
the stress-rate. In ยง2, we introduce the model we study in this work which is derived using
the viscoelastic constitutive relation and the equation of motion.
