In the second-order phase transition, however, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism has been the
popular monopole production mechanism [38,39]. Kibble correctly argued that the thermal
fluctuation is important for the monopole production, but assumed that the monopoles are
produced at the critical temperature and estimated a upper bound for the initial monopole density
using the horizon distance at the critical temperature. Zurek improved this bound taking into
account the fact that the phase transition does not take place instantaneously but continuously. The underlying assumption in both mechanisms is that the monopoles are produced during
the phase transition. But we emphasize that the change of topology which becomes the seeds of
the monopoles is generated by the thermal fluctuations of the Higgs field even after the phase
transition, not just during the phase transition.
