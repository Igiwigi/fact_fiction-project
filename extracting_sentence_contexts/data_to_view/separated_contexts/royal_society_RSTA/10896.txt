Sulphuric Acid,—As an example of the method of work, and of the way in which


DILUTE SOLUTIONS AT THE FREEZING POINT. 341

the observations were recorded, full details from the laboratory note-book are given
on p. 342, for a set of measurements on sulphuric acid. This set is chosen as a fair
example of the usual degree of constancy among the measurements of resistance. It
is also shorter than any of the others, owing to the fact that sulphuric acid had been
investigated in the preliminary experiments, and could thus be disposed of in a fewer
number of observations. Four other solutions, stronger than any of this set, were
afterwards made up, and their resistances determined in a Jena glass cell, The results
of these are included in the final table on p. 343,

Sulphuric Acid (prepared at the Chemical Laboratory).—A quantity of redistilled
sulphuric acid was taken, and the percentage of H,SO, found. Then a known
weight of SO, was obtained, and the calculated quantity of the sulphuric acid was
added to bring it up to 100 per cent.
