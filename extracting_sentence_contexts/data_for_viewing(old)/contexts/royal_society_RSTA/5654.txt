There is an extensive literature on mixing in fluids. From a dynamical systems point of view,
we mention only the comprehensive reference [4]. There is also an important connection with
Rayleigh—Bénard convection, where the Schmidt number is replaced by the Prandtl number (e.g.
[5,6]). Mixing has been recognized as an important mechanism for stabilization in fluids, with
connections with phenomena such as inviscid damping for the Euler equations [7] and enhanced
dissipation [8]. Recently, several works have addressed rigorous bounds on mixing rates, using
the so-called mix-norms [9-12], which allow for a quantitative approach [13-16]. These bounds
have been shown to be sharp under various constraints on the flow, such as finite energy or
enstrophy, both in the deterministic setting [16-19], as well as in the stochastic setting [20]. All
these results concern pure mixing and transport of the scalar field and can be considered in the
limit of infinite Schmidt number. There are significantly fewer works in pde/analysis addressing
mixing with diffusion and, in particular, bounds on the energy dissipation rate or the spectrum for
scalar turbulence at large, but finite, Schmidt number [21-24]. In fact, transport can both enhance
as well as balance diffusion.

Historically, the Kraichnan model [25] has played an important role in the study of anomalous
diffusion and anomalous scaling (among the many references, we mention in particular
[26-30], and the monograph [31]). In this model, the passive scalar is advected by a random
flow, generated by a Gaussian-in-space, white-in-time vector field. The velocity is only Hélder
continuous and hence the Lagrangian trajectories are not unique. In this model, anomalous
dissipation can be established rigorously, using the results in [32,33]. The non-uniqueness of
Lagrangian trajectories is a more general mechanism for spontaneous stochasticity (see [34-37] and
references therein).

The purpose of this work is to present simple deterministic examples of scalar fields and
