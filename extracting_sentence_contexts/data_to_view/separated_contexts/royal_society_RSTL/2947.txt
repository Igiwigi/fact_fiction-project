The Folliculus Graafianus, or Graafian Vesicle.

25. From the union of the ovisac with the covering or tunic now mentioned, I ap-
prehend it is that there results what has been called a Graafian vesicle ; and it ap-
pears to me that the © Couche interne de la capsule de la v6sicule de De Graar” of
Bats (Plate VII. fig. 62. hk.) is in reality the previously independent ovisac, while the
*conche externe” © of this author (Plate VII. fig. 62. 4.) is the covering or tunic of the
ovisac above mentioned.

26. Professor Barr has expressed his belief that the formation of the © ovulum”
(ovum) precedes that of the Graafian vesicle ; but he adds, © Je doute qu'il soit jamais
possible a Thomme de &en convainere par Vobservation++.” I trust that the facts
mentioned in the preceding pages, and illustrated in Plate V., will suffice to show how
far this eminent naturalist was right in his conjecture as to the priority in formation
of the ovum ; and that they will also serve to demonstrate the possibility (questioned
by Bazs) of determining this point by observation.

$ The germinal vexicle is thus in or near the centre of the yelk when the latter is first formed, This vexicle
subsequently passes to the surface of the yelk. T. W.
