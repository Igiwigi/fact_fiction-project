These projections
gradually take on the form of those which were described on the ventral part of the
perfect entozoon. The largest of the entozoa which I have seen in this stage is about
vz5th of an inch in length, and Z5th in breadth. The next facts requiring especial notice, are those connected with that stage of develop-
ment which takes place after the animalcule has become surrounded byan adventitious cyst. The first indication of the formation of such a cyst is, the turgescency of the capil-
laries, or some of the smaller vessels in the vicinity of one or more entozoa. Granular
bodies, exudation corpuscles, and fibres of different shapes next make their appearance.
