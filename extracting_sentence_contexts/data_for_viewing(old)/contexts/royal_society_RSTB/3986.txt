A small proportion of the eggs fertilized, and these grew very slowly and gave rise to
unhealthy and for the most part deformed larvae, few living longer than eight days.
One alone developed the maternal apical spike. The majority, however, did not live
more than five or six days, and did not develop the spike. MacBrine considers the
absence of the spike a paternal character, but as he did not obtain the reciprocal
cross the evidence on which he based this conclusion is indecisive.

In 1912 Fucus (28) hybridized the same species at Plymouth, but obtained both
reciprocals of the cross. Of these H. esculentus ? x Echinocardium cordatum $ was,
contrary to MacBrivr's experience, most readily obtained, and proved the least
unhealthy. Fucus points out that the wide difference separating these species is
such as to render the resulting larve derived from crossing them invariably
pathological. This is borne out by the fact that very few survive more than seven
or eight days, and always die after becoming highly abnormal and stunted. It is
doubtful, therefore, if sound deductions can be drawn from the hybridization of these
forms. In the cross Hehinus 2 x Hehinocardium f all the larve inherit the absence
of the aboral process from the female parent. In the reciprocal the majority are
highly abnormal, and have the paternal absence of the aboral process; but among
these there are always a few more healthy than the rest, and these develop the
maternal aboral process. When the paternal character dominates it would seem to
produce exceptionally unhealthy larvee.

In view of the very unhealthy larvee obtained by both MacBring and Fucus in
hybridizing Hchinocardium and Echinus, it is obvious that the specific differences
