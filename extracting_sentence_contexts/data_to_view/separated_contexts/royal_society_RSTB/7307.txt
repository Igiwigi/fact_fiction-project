The positions of the curves for Lucilia and
C. albiceps become reversed at an initial concentration of 70 Lucilia equivalents, so that the
latter species now assumes the superiority formerly evinced by Lucilia. The ability to maintain the population through efficient use of the medium under adverse
conditions clearly varies widely among the species. The failure of C. chloropyga occurs com-
paratively early and is probably due, in part, to the fact that its larvae are much more
sensitive to the mechanical effects of overcrowding than are those of Lucilia and C. albiceps. As a result, many more of the immature larvae crawl away, or are forced away from the
food and, after wandering about on the outskirts of the seething population of their fellows,
subsequently die from starvation. This was noted continually in cultures where the higher
