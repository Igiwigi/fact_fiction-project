The data
referring to the epidemic of 109} weeksâ€™ period do not offer an equally clear
interpretation, but such evidence as they present is read by me in the same light. One point of great interest, if it be admitted that the different periodicities are
due to the action of different strains of organisms, refers to the degree of protection
which one strain of organism may afford against another. The facts seem to
indicate that this degree of protection is high, but it is certainly not absolute. Second infections from measles within the short period of three weeks were far from
uncommon in the wards of the city of Glasgow hospitals set apart for the treatment
of that disease. Further, as the frequency of such second infections varied with
different epidemics, the phenomenon being at times absent, it is probable that, on the
occasions when the frequency was high, the epidemic in the city was not a single
epidemic due to one strain of organism, but to the accidental concurrence of epidemics
due to independent infecting agents.
