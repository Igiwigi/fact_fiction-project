for several values of the shape parameter, ranging from low
(a= 5) to high (a = 0.5) variance across hot spots (electronic
supplementary material, figures S9-S12). In the limit a â€” oo,
this model reduces to the uniform model considered thus far,
which is also indicated on the figures for comparison.

Under a fixed parameter regime, the mean fraction of active
targets at equilibrium H (electronic supplementary material,
figure S9) tends to increase as the variance increases (i.e. as
the shape parameter a decreases). By contrast, the equilbirium
recombination rate R (not shown) tends to decrease with decreas-
ing a. This opposite behaviour of R and H, whena varies, is due to
the fact that strongest hot spots are the first to be eroded, and
thus, the depletion of the genome-wide recombination activity
at equilibrium is mostly contributed by the extinction of a
relatively minor fraction of very strong hot spots. This effect is
stronger for smaller values of the shape parameter a.

The equilibrium diversity also tends to decrease with increas-
ing variance (decreasing a) under most parameter regimes
(electronic supplementary material, figure S10), except for extre-
mely high conversion rates vg or extremely weak selection

regimes (very small a). Correlatively, the turnover time (which
is directly proportional to diversity), also tends to decrease
