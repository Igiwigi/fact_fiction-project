Bxamination, and described with exhaustive minuteness of detail, it is a singular cireum-
Itance that most, of those peculiarities of the succession of their teeth which distinguish
Shem from other mammals appear hitherto to have escaped observation.

S Professor OwEN has, indeed, established the fact that, those posterior teeth of each
Hide of each jaw which have no deciduous predecessor are, as a general rule, four in
