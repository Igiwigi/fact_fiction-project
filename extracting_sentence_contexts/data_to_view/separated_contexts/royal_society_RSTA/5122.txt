The mass parameters for the u,d quarks that appear in the SM as a consequence of
the BEH mechanism are very small (in the few MeV range) compared with the masses of protons
and neutrons, which are about 1000 MeV. Hence, the sum of two up and one down quark mass
parameters hardly account for the mass of the proton. The largest contribution come, in fact,
from the fact that the quarks and gluons are highly relativistic objects confined in a space of the
other of a fermi. A purely quantum phenomenon owing to QCD: the confinement of colour. As
mentioned before, a new scale is generated dynamically in this case.
