case of most plants growing in ordinary conditions, it is extremely difficult to
discriminate between the effect of decreased illumination and the effect of the
decreased transpiration which is almost invariably associated with it.ยง Most
writers have simply studied sun and shade forms of leaves and have taken both
the factors together. CiemENTs, however, distinguishes several direct kinds of
response due to the stimulus of light. The first is connected with the disposition of
the chloroplasts ; we cannot, however, expect to observe these in fossil plants. Then
it would seem that the form of the mesophyll is directly affected by light. Palisade
tissue is greater, and spongy tissue less, in amount in heliophylls than in
sciophylls, and this does not appear to be entirely due to transpiration effects.
The number of stomata is often much greater in sun leaves than shade leaves,
and this character must be entirely independent of transpiration. Again, it is a
fairly general fact that sun plants have shorter internodes than those growing in
the shade, and stomata are very frequently confined to the lower face of the leaf.

The modifications due to water are more numerous and important. A water
supply too small to come up to the requirements of transpiration operates on
both the form and structure of leaves. A reduction of the transpiring surface
may be brought about by decreasing the size and number of leaves, and linear or
cylindrical leaves are very often produced in a dry situation. The position of the
leaf may be changed. The production of hanging or erect leaves on many tropical
trees is a device for reducing the intensity of insolation, and consequently the trans-
piration. Again, rolled leaves are typically xerophytic. With regard to structure,
we find that the epidermis very frequently shows modifications. The thickening of
the outer wall or cuticle almost invariably accompanies a dry situation, the cells of
