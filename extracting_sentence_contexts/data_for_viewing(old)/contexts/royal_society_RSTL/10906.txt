SOLUBILITY OF SALTS IN WATER AT HIGH TEMPERATURES. 25

distillation of water from one part to another will take place. A paraffin bath
appeared to offer greater probability of uniformity than an air bath, and was con-
sequently employed in most of the best experiments.*

3. Further, ib is obyious that the part of the tube not occupied by salt and
solution must be filled with vapour of water, which, on cooling, will condense to the
liquid state, and mix partly with the undissolved residue and partly with the
solidified s0lution which has been drained away. Unfortunately, too, this cireumstance
is complicated by the fact that the tension of such water vapour is not that which
would be given by pure water, but is the smaller tension given by the saline solution
contained within the tube.

By ascertaining the volume of this vapour, approximate correction of the results
can be effected with the aid of the tables of vapour tension of salt solutions, published
by WiLrxeR (PoaGexD. Ann., ciii., 529; ex., 564),

In any case the error on this account could not be great, but we nevertheless
thought ib advisable to make a few experiments with the object of testing directly
its probable magnitude.
