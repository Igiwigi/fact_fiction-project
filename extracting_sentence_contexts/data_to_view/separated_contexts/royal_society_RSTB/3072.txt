The nucellus was “ bliischenformig,” containing a
rather large nucleolus. In a few cases he states that the tubes had grown completely
through the nucellus, and penetrated into the micropyle. These were regarded as
abnormal, and their remarkable behaviour was thought to be due to the fact that
pollination had not oceurred. The later stages now described may be compared with the development of the
prothallus and sexual nuclei of Gnetum, especially of G. Gaemon. In the latter
speciest the free-nuclear condition, in which there is a well-developed central
vacuole, is followed by the appearance of cell-walls in the lower portion, while
the conditions still remain unchanged in the micropylar end.
