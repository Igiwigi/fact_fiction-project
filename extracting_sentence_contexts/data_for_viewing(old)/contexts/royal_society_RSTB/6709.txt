most of the hemispheres fall into two groupings which appear to contrast with one
another. Firstly, a well-marked sulcus lunatus is present with horizontal folding
of the striate cortex, and secondly, the striate cortex is folded in a vertical direction,
frequently associated with a broken condition of the sulcus lunatus. This vertical
folding is accompanied by a retreat of the area striata from the lateral surface ; but
this retreat must be of a different order from that which occurs in the European races
because the particular Australian hemispheres practically all reveal the very
primitive form of the intrastriate sulci found in the higher apes in which the whole
area of the cuneus is often occupied by the area striata. Furthermore, these cases of
vertical folding also reveal a prominent medial operculation which is suggested, in
this type, as representative of the inner part of the “‘ Affenspalte ” as the sulcus lunatus
is of the outer part in those cases where the area striata is horizontally folded. Whilst
these two types contrast, the fact that a combination of the two occurs in three hemi-
spheres suggests that they are more closely related. It almost suggests two experi-

parietal lobe. One tendency—the vertical—might well lead to the European type
with absence of sulcus lunatus ; the other might equally well tend towards the
Chinese. But these groupings of subordinate areas do not give the solution of the
racial difference, for I have found some of the best examples of vertical folding in
the Southern Chinese hemispheres. So, although the sulcus lunatus when it is
seen in the Australian looks fuller and bolder than in the Chinese, the pattern shown
