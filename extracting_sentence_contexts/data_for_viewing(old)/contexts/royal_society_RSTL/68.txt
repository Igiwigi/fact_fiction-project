HE Author'of rheſe Diſcourſes, prefixes a Preface,
wherein he ſhows the neceſſity of a right Know-

ledge of the Principles ottrue Philoſophy, and of the A- *
'nimal Oeconomy in the | Prattice of Phyfick ; where '
our Skill in curing Dil-aſes, whoſe Hiftories are known,
is always proportional to our Knowledge of the Anis |
mal Oeconomy, which of it ielf is a conſiderable: part ?
of Natural Philoſophy. He does indeed blame the too
common Merhod of Philoſophizing en Principles not
drawn from Nature, but 'ſnch 'as are the uncertain |
fictions of the Brain, whoſe' real-exiſtence can never-be
deduced from. Experiments, | This fort of Philoſophy, *
he ſays, is very prejudicial to Phyſick: Men being ge-
nerally fond of their own ProduRions, have not ſtuck
to mould' new Diſeaſes to anſwer their Hypotheſis ; ſo
that moſt of the late Hiſtories of Diſeaſes are only Phi-
loſophical Romances; but notwithſtanding this, Natu-.
ral- Philoſophy, and the Hiſtory of Diſeatles muſt go
_ Hand in Hand in improving the Art of Curing: And
he affirms, that there is no Man that praQtiſes, but.
who does it on ſome Knowledge of the Animal Oeco-
nomy, or ſome Notions of his own, which are more or |
leſs clear, according to his Skill in Natural Philoſophy.
