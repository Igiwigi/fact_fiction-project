The maximum (35-802) is from 31-54 S. lat., 72* 37' E. long., about midway
between the Cape of Good Hope and Australia, Now in the North Atlantic Ocean
even the mean salinity between 30? and 99? N. lat. is 35-932, thus greater than the
maximum in this region, though this maximum 1s from near 32* S. lat. The fact is
Striking. The minimum (25:879) is from a place high up in the Bay of Bengal, and of
Rourse highly influenced by the vast quantity of water from the Ganges. It lies, how-
Sver, about 300 English miles from the month of the Ganges; and another specimen
Srom N. lat. 17? 20', and about sixty miles nearer the mouth of the Ganges, has 32-365
Ser 1000 salt, 8 that it seems as if some other cause has also been operating to weaken
She 8ea-water at the minimum place.
