formed, since we have shown (28.) that the intensities evinced by a given quantity
of electricity are the same in both cases, and that consequently the distribution, 80
far as respects these two surfaces, must be similar.

47. Should the inductive susceptibility of the tangent disc be at any time, by its
position in respect of the electrical particles, reduced to zero, or nearly s0, it would
then fail to become in any degree charged, and would be as inefficient as a plate of
varnished glass or any other non-conductor, the inductive susceptibility of which is
80 little, that it will not, under ordinary circumstances, take up the least electricity
on being applied to a charged body. Now it is not improbable that a small insulated
plate plunged within a spherical charged hell is thus circumstanced : it may hence
fail to become charged, even although electricity should really exist there, and which
fact we have experimentally shown (31.). Similar effects would ensue in placing a
neutral body under any other circumstances involving similar conditions, as in placing
a very small conducting ball immediately between two large electrified globes. The
small globe does not, under these circumstances, according to CouLonBs, take up any
free electricity.

48. It would be difficult, without the aid of induction, to explain in what way the
mere position of a neutral body, in respect of the electrical particles by which it is
surrounded, effects its power of absorbing electricity ; and even with this we require
a more extensive investigation of the phenomena than has yet appeared. That a
change of position of the electrical particles of a charged surface in respect of each
other, and of the body charged, is attended by important consequences, has been
already shown by Voura, who obseryed the curious fact that the intensity of a charged
