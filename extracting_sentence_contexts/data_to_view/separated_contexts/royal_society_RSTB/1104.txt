the upper end of the lower peripheral fragment of the divided cord in two Cats. In one Cat (137) the left half of the split cord showed a resting difference of “007,
and the right ‘016; in the other Cat (143) the left half showed ‘021, and the right
‘013. The amounts are considerably below those just mentioned, one reason doubtless
being the fact that the portion of cord upon which the operation was carried out was
severed from the brain. (c.) Cord previously operated upon.—It has already been pointed out that, while
severance from the brain seems to induce a condition in the separated cord in which
the amount of the resting difference is less than it otherwise would have been, further
operations upon this severed fragment do not seem to notably affect the difference,
provided they are made in such situations as to leave a part of the cord both intact
and in situ between their seat and the portion observed.
