e. dehydrogenized,
and its nitrogen united to oxygen. The only thing sure is, that we know very little
about spontaneous nitrification. Considering the theoretical interest connected with the obscure phenomenon in
question, it mnst appear very desirable that novel facts should be ascertained calcu-
lated to throw light upon, and lead to the true insight into, the cause of spontaneous
nitrification. The observations I am about to state will perhaps contribute a little
to obtain that end. Some years ago I ascertained the fact, that a soJution of potash, sufficiently long
treated with air ozonized (by the means of phosphorus), yields a liquid which, being
over-saturated with sulphuric acid and heated, causes a brownish coloration round
a crystal of sulphate of iron, and has the power of destroying indigo*.
