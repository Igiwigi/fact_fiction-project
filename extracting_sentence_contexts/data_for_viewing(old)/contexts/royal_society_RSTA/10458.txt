1. The Initial Expansion.*

This expansion can, as we have seen, be made exceedingly large. But with light of
suitable intensity it can be kept within manageable limits.

PrincsHerm has worked at this phenomenon, but his conclusions have not been
confirmed in this investigation. The following experiments were therefore made very
carefully and in considerable detail.

* The results of this section were published in the ‘Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical
Society,’ vol. 11, Part IV., 1902. J. W. MEtxor published almost simultaneously the fact that hydrogen
chloride is formed during the momentary illumination producing the initial expansion. He also afterwards
arrived at the conclusion of §5 with regard to the expansion of damp chlorine alone under the influence of
light. MxE.1or’s investigations are in the ‘Journal of the Chemical Society,’ 1901, 1902.

§1. The Relation of the Initial Expansion to the Time of Insolation.

The first point considered was the relation of the expansion to the time of
illumination, the intensity of the illumination remaining constant.
