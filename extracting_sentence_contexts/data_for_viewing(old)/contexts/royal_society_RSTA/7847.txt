At low temperatures precise estimates can be made only from measurements of
magnetization in extremely high fields. Kaprrza’s results are taken as giving a

lower limit.

On the view developed here the results of Wetss on nickel in the experiments
particularly considered and in others are not inconsistent with (8.16).

The theoretical treatment of the intrinsic magnetization curve indicates that the
molecular field coefficient does not vary by more than some 10 or 20% over most
of the range below the Curie point, though the treatment is complicated by the
fact that the effective saturation moment increases by about 40% in passing from
absolute zero to temperatures above the Curie point.

Although the conclusions arrived at here do not definitely rule out a variation of
the molecular field coefficient with temperature by perhaps 50%, the view which
has long been maintained by Weiss, namely that Ne is constant, is not necessarily
inconsistent with them. Such a view, however, could hardly be accepted in the
face of the glaring discrepancies in the estimates made of Ne, Table I. In the present
paper an attempt has been made to account for these discrepancies, and at the same
time, by a detailed analysis and interpretation of the results for the magnetization,
magneto-caloric effect, and specific heat of nickel, to contribute towards a clearer
understanding of ferromagnetic pheonomena generally.
