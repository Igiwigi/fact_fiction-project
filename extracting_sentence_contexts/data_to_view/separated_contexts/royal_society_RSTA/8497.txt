In this case the @ priori probability will
be dé/x, and that after making the observations will be proportional to

(1+sin 6)* (1—sin 6)" da,

But if we interpret this in terms of p, we obtain

2 d ns iJ

Pp (1p? Fame = p**(1—p)-* dp,
p(1—p)

a result inconsistent with that obtained previously. In fact, the distribution previously

assumed for p was equivalent to assuming the special distribution for 0,

af = cos 10,

the arbitrariness of which is fully apparent when we use any variable other than p. In a less obtrusive form the same species of arbitrary assumption underlies the method
