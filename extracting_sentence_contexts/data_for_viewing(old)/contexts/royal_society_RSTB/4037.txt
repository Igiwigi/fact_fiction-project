distress, nearly vomited, turned an ashy grey colour, knees wobbled. He
managed to reach the laboratory however. After the violent hyperncea there
was a period of irregular apnoeas and deep gasps, then Cheyne-Stokes breathing.
Oxygen caused at first apncea, then regular deep breathing, very comforting and
agreeable to the subject. On stopping the oxygen Cheyne-Stokes breathing
returned.”

The greater tendency to periodic breathing after an exertion was probably due to
a temporary fatigue of the lung epithelium, and consequent lowering of arterial
oxygen pressure. After an exertion the alveolar oxygen pressure was usually rather
high for some time, so that a lowering of this could not have been the cause.

Closely connected with periodic breathing is the fact that any temporary holding
of the breath caused hyperpnoea immediately. This was very evident during the
first days on Pike’s Peak, and caused us a good deal of inconvenience in such opera-
tions as reading gas burettes, shaving, &c. At ordinary barometric pressures one is
accustomed to hold the breath during various short exertions, and to make it
synchronise with other exertions, such as that of walking. The partial loss of this
power was a distinct trouble.

We were all able to hold the breath at sea-level for about 40 seconds by voluntary
effort. After the first 48 hours on Pike’s Peak, HenpERsoN, Douetas, and HALDANE
could not hold longer than 15 to 18 seconds, though ScunerpErR could hold for
40 seconds. On our descent to Manitou, HENDERSON and HALDANE found, much to
their surprise, that they could still hold no longer than on the summit. At Colorado
