Owing to Cogentâ€™s type system, the compiler even
knows which objects have to be deallocated before returning, so the default clean-up code could
be automatically generated. Independent of the language, we cannot always avoid serialization and deserialization of data. In fact, a significant portion of file systems code is typically concerned with this monotonous and
error-prone task. Data description languages address exactly this problem by generating the code
automatically given specifications of the serialized and deserialized format. Following a similar
approach as PADS [71], we are currently working on adding language-level support for data
(de-)serialization to Cogent.
