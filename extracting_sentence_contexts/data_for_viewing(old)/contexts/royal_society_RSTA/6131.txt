is found there, and a ‘0’ otherwise, and Tr is the matrix trace. With this definition, the consensus
sequence sg has E1(sy) = 0, and sequences that carry symbols at that position that rarely occur in
the MSA score badly (have high energy). For cases where the symbol does not occur at all in the
MSA at that position, we have to introduce the concept of pseudocounts in order to deal with
zeros in the denominator of (3.9), as we discuss in more detail below. Using a threshold where
all sequences with an energy score lower than the threshold are predicted to be functional DNA
binding sites, BvH theory is fairly successful at predicting DNA binding sites in a genome (e.g.
[25]), and even at detecting correlations between binding sites [26].

We have now seen that BvH theory can assign a score that reflects the functionality of a
sequence pattern without the need to fit any parameters. But in order to quantify the functionality
of sequences with significant correlations between sites, we have to go beyond that theory. We
now introduce a second-order PWM (as BvH in fact did in the appendix to [22], but for adjacent

monomers only)

Just as before, pjj(Sa, Sp) is the likelihood to find symbol combination sq, sp at the pair of sites i, j,
while po(sjj) is the likelihood to find the consensus pair there.

Defining this matrix implicitly assumes that beyond monomers, any pair of monomers is in
statistical equilibrium as well. While assuming that even higher-order correlations are in statistical
