As may be seen from the figure, the real supercooling taking into
account the crystal growth process in a mushy layer (time-dependent functions w) is always
below than the main contribution wo, which characterizes the phase evolution in the absence
of particle nucleation in a mush. The evolutionary behaviour of the phase boundary plotted in figure 3 shows that the
nucleation and growth processes in a mushy region substantially constrict its width, namely
the bell-shaped dashed line taking into account particle nucleation and growth lies below the
corresponding curve without nucleation (solid line which behaves as the square root of time self-
similar law [38,39]). This very different transient behaviour arose from the fact that the growing
nuclei release the latent heat of phase transition and compensate the mushy layer supercooling. In summary, the theory under consideration is concerned with approximate solution of
nonlinear integro-differential model that describes the transient phase transition dynamics
complicated by crystal nucleation and growth processes. Taking into account the previously
developed theory of particle nucleation in a motionless metastable liquid [7,16], we analytically
describe the mushy layer evolution in unsteady-state manner which is caused by the crystal
nucleation phenomenon.
