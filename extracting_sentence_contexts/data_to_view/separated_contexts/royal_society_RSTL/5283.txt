MR. A. CAYLEY'S INTRODUCTORY MEMOIR UPON QUANTICS, 249

9. What precedes is a return to and generalization of the method employed in the
first part of the memoir published in the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical
Journal, Old Series, t. iv., and New Series, t. i., under the title © On Linear Trans-
formations,” and CRELLE, t. xxx., under the title * Memoire sur les Hyperd6termi-
nants,” and which I shall refer to as my original memoir. I there consider in fact
the invariants of a quantic

(a are 2 ts)
linear in regard to n sets each of them of m facients, and I represent the coefficients
of a term 7,y,2;.. by rst.. There is no difficulty in seeing that «, 3, being any two
different numbers out of the series 1, 2..m, the operation {xd,,} is identical with the
operation

E2..(aat..795>),

where the summations refer to s, t.. which pass respectively from 1 to m, both inclu-
8ive; and the condition that a function, assumed to be an invariant, 7. e. to contain
only the coefficients, may be reduced to zero by the operation {xd,,} —x,d,,, is of
course simply the condition that such function may be reduced to zero by the opera-
tion {x;d,,} ; the condition in question is therefore the same thing as the equation
