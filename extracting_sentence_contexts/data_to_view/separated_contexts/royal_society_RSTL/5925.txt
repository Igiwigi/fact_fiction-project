In a transverse section they present no dark masses resembling those of
Zhe posterior vesicular columns, but only a few cells, of various shapes, at their bases.
#\ distinct stratum, however, of small fusiform cells, in connexion with the fibres of
Zhe posterior roots of the nerves, extends diagonally from the point of each cornu to
Ehe posterior commissure, which is also interspersed with numerous nuclei, like those
Sf the epithelium which lines the canal. In the cervical and lumbar enlargement, the
Sells, as well as the stratum which they form, are larger than in the dorsal region.

tance (9) becomes continuous from side to side in a curve with its concavity backwards,
