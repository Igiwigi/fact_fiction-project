GUNN ON LINEARIZED SUPERSONIC

generally give a reasonable indication of the resultant forces to be expected on an aerofoil
surface. This paper is concerned with the extension of the linearized supersonic theory to
flow past finite aerofoils, so far as possible of arbitrary plan and cross-section. In fact,
certain limitations will be found in the applicability of the theory, which will be discussed
as they arise. A brief discussion of previous work on supersonic flow past finite aerofoils is perhaps
necessary to explain the authorâ€™s standpoint. The first attempts were made by Schlichting
(1936) on the basis of a lifting-surface theory put forward by Prandtl.
