Nu due to w(z=0) 40. Figure 8 shows the total energy dissipation « and the pressure power
on the permeable walls, 2(w*)|z=0/(BH), normalized by US /H (i.e. the first and second terms in
the right-hand side of equation (2.10)). As BU increases, the vertical fluid motion is significantly
enhanced, so that the total energy dissipation scales with U°/H at high Ra, largely different from
the decreasing dissipation relatively with respect to U°/H in the impermeable-wall case. The
same is true of the pressure power, namely it could scale with U3/H at high Ra. The latter, the
energy sink, would be prominent in the total energy budget for larger BU. The scaling « ~ U°/H
in the permeable-wall case, for which we have observed the ultimate scaling Nu ~Ral/?, isa
direct consequence of the energy budget (2.10) instead of Taylor’s inertial dissipation originating
from vorticity stretching in three-dimensional flows. In figure 9a,b, we show the local energy
dissipation ¢(z) = (v/2)((duj/dxj + duj/Axi)*), normalized by u3/H in the permeable-wall case
fU=155. In the bulk region, the local dissipation decreases relatively with respect to U°/H as
Ra increases. The low dissipation should be due to the fact that in two-dimensional flow, there is
no vorticity stretching and thus no small-scale dissipative structure (figure 7). The local energy
dissipation is much higher in the near-wall region, increasing relatively with respect to U°/H
with increasing Ra. This is the reason why the total dissipation ¢ can scale with U°/H in spite of
decreasing ¢/' (U3 /H) with increasing Ra in the bulk region.

In wall-bounded thermal convection, a flow on the horizontal wall is also driven by buoyancy.
In the present flow configuration, however, there are no mean velocities in the horizontal-plane
average of the periodic box. To examine the characteristics of the mean horizontal flow in the
two-dimensional steady solutions, we average the horizontal velocity over the horizontal planes
for the single convection roll in the symmetric solutions as
