Let us look at the viral load distributions at these chosen time points in more detail, figure 5b.
We see that the distributions differ substantially. For a rising epidemic (t € {20,30}), the bulk of
the probability mass is shifted towards the left, indicating a lower viral load. As individuals
become infected faster and faster, there are more individuals who are at an early stage in the
course of their infection. Recall from figure 3a that we expect a peak viral load perhaps a week
after initial infection and then a slow decay over the subsequent several weeks. On the other
hand, for a falling epidemic (t € {56, 66}), the probability distribution is bimodal. Much of the
probability mass is concentrated in the lowest viral load as many individuals are on the point
of recovery. However, a significant amount of probability mass is present in high viral loads
reflecting individuals with developed infections and slowly decaying viral loads. A similar effect
was noted by Hay et al. [4] who showed that rising and falling epidemics can be distinguished by
looking at the distribution of cycle threshold values in PCR tests and that this can, in fact, be used
to estimate the time-varying reproduction number R(t) in a population. We recover this result as
a consequence of the immune dynamics in the model.

5. Discussion

Previous work on models, both across domains and for infectious disease modelling specifically
[35], have suggested that there are various features which make models more useful for different
tasks. For infectious disease modelling, useful features include predictive accuracy, ability to
