The results are collected in Table I. Working graphs were constructed from these
figures to the following scale :—

NITROCELLULOSE IN ACETONE-WATER MIXTURES, 255

Partial Vapour Pressures of Acetone-water Mixtures.—In view of the fact that there
is an acetone-water complex formed, it seemed desirable to have measurements of the
partial pressure of acetone-water mixtures, as this figure is proportional to the activity
of the acetone in the solution: for where there is a complex the concentration alone
may give quite an erroneous measure of the “active mass” of the acetone. The
apparatus just described was suitable for the measurements.
