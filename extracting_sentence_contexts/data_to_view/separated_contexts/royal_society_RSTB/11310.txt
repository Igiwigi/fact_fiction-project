promising approach is the use of drugs with biphasic

condition with the antagonist fluphenazine, high antagonist S
actions (first phase stimulating, thereafter sedative

PRL responders developed more cigarette craving than
lows. This means the biochemical response may be a pre-
requisite for the psychological change only in highly
susceptible individuals. This was also supported by the fact
that individuals responding by equal PRL responses to both
drugs also did not differ in smoking urge in the lisuride
and fluphenazine condition. This indicates that manipula-
tions of the TM systems by stimulation and blockade
cannot only help to trace specific temperament-related sus-
ceptibilities, but also provides some information on the
question under which conditions a possibly causal relation-
ship between the biochemical and psychological indicator
of TM activity may become manifest. Study 20: An additional evaluation indicated that an
expected overall effect of the DA agonist bromocriptine on
smoking urge according to incentive stimulation theory [73]
was not observed.
