I am informed by
Mr Clifford Dobell, however, that he has observed an accessory flagellum—much as
in Monas—in forms otherwise indistinguishable from Bicoeca lacustris James-Clark, and
that he believes that forms with two anterior flagella undoubtedly exist. Stained pre-
parations of three species of Bicoeca by von Prowazek (1903), Reynolds (1927) and
myself (see p. 459) show no trace of a second anterior flagellum. The situation
is rendered all the more confusing by the fact that when Kent and Stokes published
their descriptions the anchoring filament was not recognized as a flagellum, and the
two flagella of the free-swimming form were identified by Kent with the two anterior
flagella of the sessile form. Yet since the posterior anchoring filament is undoubtedly
a flagellum, the free-swimming form should have three flagella, if indeed there are
