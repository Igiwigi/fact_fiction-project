ternal examination that the essentially bipartite nature of the air-bladder becomes
Apvious. {n fact, in all the normal Siluride the air-bladder is, physiologically, as
truly bipartite as in other Ostariophyse, and the former derive precisely the same
physiological adyantage in the registration of hydrostatic pressure variations from
this fact as do the latter. Neither is SacemeHL quite accurate in supposing that
Aughenoglanis® and Auohenipterus possess an air-bladder which is bipartite externally
asin the Cyprinidia, inasmuch as we have already shown, in the morpbological section
of this paper, that in both genera the bladder is substantially similar to that of all other
Siluridi: normales so far as this point is concerned. Sagewunt’s suggestion that the

close relation of the lateral walls of the air-bladder to the external skin, and th

to the surrounding medium, enables the air-bladder more promptly to react to
pressure oscillations is, perhaps, not improbable, and, if such be the case, would
certuinly have the effect of rendering the Siluride much more seusitive to variations
of hydrostatic pressure than is the case with other Ostariophyses where the ait
bladder is separated from the external skin by the lateral lobes of the liver and othey
abdominal viscera, While admitting the feasibility of this suggestion, we may point
out that the eonneetion of the air-bladder with the superficial skin would also enable
variations in the size of the air-bladder, the result of pressure variations, sore
promptly to modify the volume and specific gravity of the Fish, for any expansion ov
contraction of that organ from such eauses must at once lead to the imward on
outward bulging of the lateral eutaneous areas.
