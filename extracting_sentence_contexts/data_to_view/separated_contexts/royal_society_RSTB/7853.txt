The point was
investigated in a number of specimens, and it was found that the adhesion is in fact normal. Pleural cavities are present in foetal stages and are obliterated soon after birth; costal
movements in breathing are thus reduced to a minimum and respiration is largely
diaphragmatic. This fact contributes to the remarkable stillness of a standing elephant in
repose. A very young elephant calf in distress was observed to call loudly and continuously,
its chest heaving very much after the manner of the young of the domestic cow or sheep. The anatomy of the alimentary system has been fairly thoroughly described in both
Indian and African elephants, and nothing has been added during this research.
