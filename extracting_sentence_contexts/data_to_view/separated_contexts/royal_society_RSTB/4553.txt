Or the anal fin may not develop, the dorsal fin remaining very large and
reaching to the head (Trachypterus, fig. 99). Here we have one-half of the. Flat-fish
condition and, as a matter of fact, the fish is said to swim obliquely in the water and
lie on its side at the bottom like a Flat-fish. But the skull has just managed to
escape the final deflections by being bent down so far, that the compression of the
jaws acts on the dorsal surface, with the result that the mouth is very protractile. In
the Flat-fishes the anterior end of the skull is bent upwards again.
