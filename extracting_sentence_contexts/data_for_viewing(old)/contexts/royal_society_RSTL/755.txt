elastic force generated at that high temperature.

When we turn our attention to ether, we find the discre-
pancies, if possible, less easy to reconcile. At the temperature
of 212?, for example, where the old and new scales meet for
the last time, the force of its vapour by the geometrical
progression exceeds that found from experiment, by the
enormous quantity of 67 inches and a half ; amounting to two
fifths of the whole elastic force evolved.

May we venture, then, to conclude, from these multiplied
comparisons, that the progressions of elasticity in vapours,
taught by Mr. DaLTox, are geometrical fictions, intended to
quadrate with his notions concerning temperature ; but not
consonant with the laws or phenomena of nature ?

Within a moderate compass, indeed, it is not difficult to
Suit the ratio of elastic force and the thermometric graduation
to each other; but the prosecution of the enquiry into ranges
more remote, detects the fallacy of such hypothetical adapta-
