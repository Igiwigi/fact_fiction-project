The analysis @ was made on the first portion of the distillate, 6 and & on the last third,
and d by treating an alcoholic solution of oil of rue with gaseous hydrochloric acid, and
reobtaining the aldehyde by the addition of water. It would appear that this last opera-
tion (supposed by him to yield an isomeric modification of the capric aldehyde) was in
fact to some extent a process of purification, the liquid s0 prepared having a fruity odour,
different from the oil merely purified by distillation, and therefore resembling the pure
and fragrant aldehyde obtained by me. Although the experiments detailed scarcely permit a doubt of the true nature of the
substance (especially when the mode of purification is considered), still it was wished to
place the matter beyond dispute. With this intention, the aldehyde obtained from the
crystalline bisulphite was again treated with bisulphite of ammonia, and the whole pro-
cess of purification repeated.
