Then follows the tetrad division, all the cells of the sporogenous
mass taking part in it in normal sporangia. A tapetum is meanwhile formed from
the cells adjoining the sporogenous group, and these may grow and assume irregular
form, encroaching on the cavity, as in the case of Danea. In fact all the main
features are the same as in other Marattiacez. As in other genera, an estimate has been made of the average number of spores
which may be produced from a normal sporangium of Kaulfussia. An average
number of spore-mother-cells exposed in a single vertical section of a sporangium,
radially through the sorus, is found to be 245; transverse or tangential sections
show that the whole sporogenous mass is about eight layers in thickness; the total
number of spore-mother-cells would therefore be about 1960, and the potential
number of spores per sporangium ahout 1960 x 4 = 7840.
