exceptions, wonderfully uniform. In fig. 17 (G.'l.) the values range from — 0°0072 to
—0°0100 ; in fig. 18 (G.U.) the majority of the readings range from —0°0037 to
—0°6119, though a few readings are lower. The average of readings usually
approximates to the value for @ but there are always some extrinsic deflections which
precede Q.

That the extrinsic deflection results from the excitation of some deep lying mass of
muscle cannot be doubted ; that most extrinsic deflections from a single heart represent
the activation of the same region of that heart seems clear from the general uniformity
of the readings. It is certain that the earliest extrinsic deflection from a given con-
tact is not an expression of activity in the deeper layers of the muscle wall at the point
investigated, for, if that were so, the values should rise over the right ventricle when
the right branch division is transected. In point of fact they do not rise (Table XTX).
It seems clear, therefore, that extrinsic deflections recorded from a contact over the

right ventricle may represent the passage of an excitation wave through portions of
the left ventricle.
