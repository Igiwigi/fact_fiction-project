comparison a physiological and anatomical basis; he says, ‘‘ Personally, I should
incline to regard them rather as a specialised family, modified in consequence of
saprophytic habit, though probably derived from a very ancient Fern-stock, possibly
the same as that from which the Cycadofilices took their origin. This last suggestion
is based on a number of points, chiefly anatomical.”t The anatomical comparison
has not yet been stated, but on the saprophytic habit the following considerations
may be advanced: mycorhiza has been observed in Ophioglossum vulgatumt and in

O. pendulum ;* it has also been seen in twelve species of Botrychium, by GREVILLIUS,T
but in varying abundance, and Kiun had previously described it for B. Lunaria.t
In Helminthostachys the fungus is present in the first three or four roots of the
young plant, but absent in the roots produced later.§ It is thus seen that mycorhiza
is not distributed with constancy in the family; in none of them does it take so
prominent a part in the nutrition as to lead to their discarding, or even in marked
degree reducing their dependence on the chlorophyll function. The facts will hardly
