of Sir Isaac NewrToN's doctrine of infinite series. And I fur-
ther observe, 72 transilu, that Facnant's theorem, respecting
the rectification of the ellipsis, is attainable in the same easy
manner. These devices are indeed very ingenious ; but their

utility appears to me to be much less than has been imagined.
It has been represented even in these Transactions, for the
year 1804, p. 236, that Facnant's theorem is necessary to
the investigation of EuLER's series for computing the length
of a quadrantal arch of an ellipsis ; yet, the fact is, that Fag-
Nant's theorem is no more Tequisite on that occasion than
LanDEN's theorem is in the investigation of a similar-series
for computing the difference between the lengths of an infinite
arch of an hyperbola and its asymptote, which will be given
in this Paper.

27. It appears by inspecting the values of z and 2+ d, ex-

hibited in terms of e and /, in Art. 25, that when y becomes

equal to, or greater than, =, Theorem IV. will be more
