found by the persistence of the germinal vesicle for a -short time, even after the egg
has escaped from the ovary into the cavity of the abdomen, as the undeveloped
spermatozoal cell passes from the testis into the efferential duct, —are later in their
development than others. Further, it may be remembered+, that s0. far from the
contents of the yelk being in a dormant condition at the time of oviposition, as some
inquirers have supposed4, there are changes still going on within it, and which are
perceptible to the eye, in the condition of the white surface, for ten or twelve minutes
after oviposition ; after which they become less and less marked, and s0on entirely
cease if the egg be not fecundated.

Thus then from a comparison of the state of the fecundatory agent with the body
to be fecundated, we might have expected to have found some close coincidence in
the retention of their vitality, and this indeed, in a state of nature, seems to be the fact.
Spawning seldom or never takes place by the act of the species until each sex has
attained its full maturity of function. The eggs are sometimes voluntarily retained
by the female Frog, for several hours or days within the uteri, although arrived at
maturity, if the proper evolution of spermatozoa in the male be not completed. I
have had evidence of this in the fact, that when the union of the sexes has been of
long continuance, the female has sometimes passed a very few ova, and then has con-
tinued without further oviposition for many hours, sometimes for a day or two,
before the mass was expelled, and the function of the sexes consummated. These first
extruded eggs have almost always been found to be unimpregnated.

When the eggs have been deposited, the cireumstances which affect their fecunda-
tion are precisely similar to those which affect the spermatozoa,—the temperature
