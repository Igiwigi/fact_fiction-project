There is accordingly not only a correlation between shore-living attached forms and
viviparity on the one hand, and sand-flat free-living oviparous forms on the other, but
there seems to be a corresponding association between the presence of urodele larvae
among the former and anural larvee among the latter. The agreement is not absolute,
as GIARD thought, yet is very much closer than the opponents of his view considered,
and when the development of more species that are free-living and oviparous is known,
it may become closer still. Summarising the principal facts and conclusions so far reached :—

(a) Anural development is confined to Molgulide within the Ascidiacea ;
(b) a sandflat free-living habitat is typical of the Molgulide and of no other group ;

(c) apart from “6” there seems to be no other peculiarity in the mode of life of
the family ;

(d) the shore-living forms become attached, viviparous, and with two exceptions
retain the tadpole larva ;

(ec) viviparity is a rarity among the free-living forms, and that all but one of these
possess anural larvee ;

(f) the origin of anural development is polyphyletic ;

(g) of the two attached forms with anural development there is strong reason to
believe that M. bleizi is a species derived directly from the anural M. occulta,
and that the other, M. retortiformis, shows more markedly than most attached
forms its free-living origin ; 7.e., in both species anural development conceivably
arose while they were yet free-living sand forms.
