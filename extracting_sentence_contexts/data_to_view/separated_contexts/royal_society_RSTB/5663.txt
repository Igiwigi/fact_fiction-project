corresponding to CyyH,o0,N, while a phenylhydrazine salt
of citrinin would require a nitrogen content of 7-82 per cent. corresponding to
CyoHs205Np. Taking the above figures for the nitrogen content of this compound, and also con-
sidering the fact that it is insoluble in potassium acetate solution and that citrinin
cannot be shown to exhibit ketonic properties with other ketonic reagents, it appears
probable that the derivative obtained is a phenylhydrazide of citrinin. As little success had been obtained in attempts to make derivatives of citrinin the
breakdown products of citrinin were now investigated. Decomposition Propucts or Crrrinin.
