of forging of the rod from which the test piece was turned, and it seems probable that
this temperature must have been rather low, with an appreciable amount, therefore, of
* cold work,” and consequent mechanical hardening.

Turning to the materials used in the present research, which were not included in the
Hadfield series of tests in liquid air, these are 11 in number, 7 containing iron in
considerable proportion.

The results from the plain nickel-iron alloys 3450 and 5277, containing high percen-
tages, 35-8 and 57-5, of nickel, demonstrate that as the percentage of nickel increases
the ductility in liquid hydrogen also increases, until at 57°5% nickel it is actually
greater at this low temperature than at ordinary temperature. Among the ferrous
materials tested, this alloy 5277 has, in fact, the greatest ductility, 35-°5%, of any.
Since, associated with this excellent ductility, it has a tenacity as high as 73 tons per
square inch, the choice of this material for the stressed members of the testing apparatus

used in the present research will be seen to have been an excellent one.

It is evident that as the nickel percentage increases in these high-nickel alloys they
partake more and more of the character of nickel itself, which, as has been seen, also
