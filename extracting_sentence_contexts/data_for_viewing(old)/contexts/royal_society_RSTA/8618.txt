is shown. The fineness of the partitions shown in this photograph approximates to the
fineness which can easily be obtained with the fluorescene used for eye observations,
but it is not actually quite so good.

Case when the Cylinders Rotate in, Opposite Directions. -

When yw is negative—that is, when the cylinders rotate in opposite directions, only
one case has been worked out completely, namely, that in which « = —1-5, R, = 3-80,
R, = 4-035. The characteristic differences revealed by the analysis between the
motion in this case, and that in the case when ys is positive, are :—

(a) The spacing of the vortices is reduced in the ratio 1-73:1. The predicted
spacing of the vortices in this case is in fact (4-035 —3-80)/1-73 = 0-136 cm. ;
and

(b) The vortices in contact with the inner cylinder only extend out about half-way
to the outer cylinder instead of extending right across the fluid annulus.

(a) Spacing of Vortices—To verify the conclusions reached in regard to the spacing
of the vortices a number of measurements were taken when the radius of the inner
cylinder was 3-80 em., the values of « ranging from -+-0-65 to —1-78.
