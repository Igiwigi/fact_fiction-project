= There are here evident indications of the rate of retardation being somewhat greater
5 at low than at comparatively high pressures ; but, neglecting these indications, the
above numbers give 1-043 second as the average retardation in- a six-inch or thirty-
seconds fuse for each inch of mercurial pressure removed. This result agrees closely with
that obtained by Quartermaster MITCHELL, if we except those fuses which he burnt at the
greatest altitude, and in referenee to which some error must obyiously have crept in,
either as regards the altitude of the station where the fuses were burnt, or the duration
of their combustion. The latter source of error is perhaps rendered less improbable,
from the fact that only two experiments were made at the greatest altitude, whilst six
were performed at two, and four at the third of the remaining stations. The following
Table shows Mr. Mrrentrii's reults, uniformly with those in the last Table.
