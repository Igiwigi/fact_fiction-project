Given the equation (z,y) = þ (— £8 =]
here we have f(z)=f(—-x), and a particular solution is fa==2*;
also f (y) =f(=) and a particular case isf (9) ==
1 x1 1
hence the general solution of the equation is
(2,9) =0(x,=)
@ being perfectly arbitrary. If we employ the. general solutions of the equations
ea =f=z) andf(y)=f(=), we shall still only have one
arbitrary function. In fact, the most general solution of the
equation v (z,y) =v (—z, =) with which I am at present
acquainted is
and this only involves one arbitrary function.


186 Mr. BABBAGE'S essay towards

PrRoBLEM II. Given the same equation
v (2,9) =v (az, by)
Suppose one particular solution of this equation is known,
let it be f(z, y),
then take y (z, y) =o f(=,y), 6 being perfectly arbitrary
and the given equation becomes
ef (2,9) = of (ar, fy)
which is evidently satisfied ey, (2,3) =Ff (az, fy) by the
hypothesis.
