This very marked
degree of vacuolation is evidently a process of fatty degeneration, but nevertheless appears
to represent a functional phase of the corpus luteum which persists for a long time. It
would seem that during this time substances are slowly released from the vacuoles in
a process which involves the eventual destruction of the cells. With the exhaustion of the
vacuoles the luteal cells in fact disappear, and are replaced by connective tissue elements. Another feature is the marked orientation of the luteal tissue in a framework of connec-
tive tissue, seen in figures 23 and 24. The orientation is related to the vascular supply, and
particularly to the arrangement of prominent channels, presumably lymphatic in nature,
which are lined by a well-defined epithelium and which evidently function as a drainage
system. â€˜They are present in the earliest stages in this material, and persist until the corpus
luteum finally and rather suddenly declines, a process which, in the present material, is
illustrated by stages immediately before and after parturition.
