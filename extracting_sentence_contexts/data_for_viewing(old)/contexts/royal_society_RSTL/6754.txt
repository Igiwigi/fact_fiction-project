regard to the Nitrogen which long washing might have endangered, or at least rendered
less easy. There is, however, evidently a slight gain of dry matter, which, so far as its
carbon is concerned, was doubtless due to carbonic acid in the distilled water, of which
"about 500 cub. cent. were added to each pot at the commencement of the experiment.
None was added during the progress of the experiment ; but the s0il was moist when
the plants were taken up.

yery limited distribution of the roots, and the fact that no water was added 4
growth, which would tend to distribute any s0luble or otherwise easily transpo
matters, are conditions all consistent with the almost total absence of Nitrogen in t

Lastly in regard to the results in the Table (X1.), the final column, showing the
or loss of Nitrogen, affords us the means of judging how far the molecular actions
which free Nitrogen was given off in the cases of the experiments upon the d
position of nitrogenous organic matter are likely to interfere with the results of
investigations on the question of assimilation of free Nitrogen by plants. It is seen
in the experiments now under consideration, no free Nitrogen was given off during
process of germination and growth. At least, the asswmption that free Nitrogen
given off implies the still more improbable one, that, under the circumstances detai
