losophers ; but when it is songht to introduce new views and generalizations upon
sullicient experimental evidence, they become absolutely necessary, and operate'be-
neficially in assisting the mind to break through the trammels of a train of thought
which is invariably attached to old expressions. Suffer me to make a moderate tie
of this new nomenelature in what I have farther to communicate.

One of the principal objections to Davy's theory of the salts has always been the
impossibility of isolating, and preserving in a free state, the compounds of acids with
the additional equivalent 'of oxygen which it supposed; and in their electrolysis we
find that the ions invariably evolve their oxygen at the zincode. It occurred to me
that evidence” of their isolation might be found in the beautiful experiments of
M. Taexarv®, which led to the discovery of oxygenated water. It will be remem-
bered, in fact, that the first conclusion which that eminent philosopher drew from
them was that the phenomena were due to such combinations of the acids with
oxygen; and it was only after a long course of further investigation that he rested in
the opinion that the extra equivalent of oxygen was in all cases united to the water
with whieh' they were mixed. He at the same time allowed that the combination was
greatly more permanent when any acid was present.' I was in hopes that/I might have
obtained further evidence of the fact from an apparatus which I contrived for the pur-
pose, but the' results were not conclusive, and'I shall not trouble'you with the details.
