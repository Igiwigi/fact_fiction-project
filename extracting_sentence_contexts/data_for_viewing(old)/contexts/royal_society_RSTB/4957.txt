any known member of the Branchiopoda. The principal of these differences may be
stated as follows :â€”

Points of Difference from the Anostraca.

1. Absence of stalked eyes.

2. First antenne distinctly three-jointed (in this differing also from the majority
of the Branchiopoda).

3. Second antenne in the adult of both sexes forming large biramous swimming organs,
retaining, in fact, the chief characteristics of the second antennz as found in the larval
forms of the Anostraca and most Branchiopods.

4. The adult male provided with a pair of powerful clasping organs, which were not
modifications of the second antennz as in the Anostraca, but arose just behind the
mandibles and were probably developed from the maxillule.

5. Trunk limbs rather sharply separated into two series (in this differing also from
the majority of the Branchiopoda).

6. The first three pairs of trunk limbs, although of the foliaceous type, having the
terminal part much modified to form scraping or rasping organs.
