On the left-hand side of these
equations there are still derivatives of the first order. If, however, we write

I(F) = 1(F,) + I(F;),

in accordance with equation (3.13), and use equation (4.10), we are able to reduce
equation (8.11) so that it contains second-order derivatives only. In fact, we find
