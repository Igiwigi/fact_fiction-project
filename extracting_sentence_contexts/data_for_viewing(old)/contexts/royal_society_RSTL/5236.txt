by all recent writers on the snbject of bone; their variable size and not nnfrequent
anastomoses have been pointed ont; and the fact of the larger apertures in the
spongy parts of bone being similar in the structure of their parietes to the smaller
ones in the denser parts of the osseous tissue has not failed to be recognized. It may
be remarked, that whether the canals are large or small, their section presents an

oval or circular outline, and that the walls of such canals have a tolerably uniform
surface. When examining sections of bone it is necessary to bear this fact in mind,
for on a close inspection it will be seen that there are other spaces which possess a
different character, although up to the present time, 80 far as the authors know, this
difference has not been recognized.

These spaces are irregular in shape, and have an irregular, festooned and often
jagged outline, similar to that found on the surface of bone which has been removed
by exfoliation, similar also to the surface left upon the fang of a tooth after a part has
been absorbed. Such spaces correspond in shape to the peripheral outline of one or
more of the Haversian systems, and are in fact subservient to the development, of
those systems, and necessarily precede their formation (Plate VI. figs. 2 a, 3 a, 4 a). It
is proposed to call these spaces which are produced by absorption, Haversian spaces,
as this name is indicative of their ultimate connection with the Haversian systems.
