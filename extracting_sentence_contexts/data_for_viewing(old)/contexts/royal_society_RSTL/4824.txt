The preceding sketch, incomplete as it is, sufficiently exhibits the leading features
of the new class of snbstances, of which tetrethylammonium and its compounds are
the prototypes. It is at once evident that there is a marked difference between these
latter and the bases which I have described in my former memoir, Irrespectively of
the non-volatility of the new basic oxide, which forms in itself a line of demarcation,
there are many other properties not less distinctive which attract our attention. The
consecutive replacement of the several hydrogen-equivalents of ainmonia induces a
gradual change in the properties of the original atom ; ethylamine is almost as soluble
in water as ammonia itself; in diethylamine this property is less marked ; and finally,
triethylamine is till less soluble. But another equivalent of ethyl being added, the
substance changes altogether in property ; it becomes soluble in water in all propor-
tions, in fact 80 soluble that it can scarcely be obtained in the drystate. A perfectly
analogous, although reverse deportment, is exhibited by the platinum-salts of the
various bases ; here we find that the s0lubility of the salts augments with the degree
of ethylation, the salt of triethylamine being soluble in the extreme, while suddenly
the tetrethylammonium-compound becomes not more soluble than the ammonium-
compound itself. It is evident that ethylamine, diethylamine and triethylamine are
compound ammonias ; the tetrethylated base is a compound oxide of ammonium.

It now remained only to submit the new base again to the action of iodide of ethyl.
An experiment on a small scale showed that the two compounds do not fail to act
