Figure 4. DCell facilitatates interpretation of how mutations affect phenotypes. When rev7 and rad57 (dark nodes at the bottom) are mutated, colony growth is
severely reduced, indicated by the dark blue (dark grey in black/white version) colouring for the node labelled ‘cell’ at the top. The fact that the node for DNA repair
is also coloured dark blue (dark grey in black/white) indicates that it is a mechanism that is severely impaired in the mutant yeast and may explain the reduced cell
growth. The nodes shown in light blue and light pink (light grey in black/white) indicate nodes with only moderately altered activations. (Online version in colour.)
