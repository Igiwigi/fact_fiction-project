on the large scale, to reduce, and not to increase, the relation of the as8med flesh-

reason or other, better adapted to meet the collective requirements of the human
- organism, at least under many conditions, than an exclusively Bread, or other vegetable
one, the testimony of common experience may be accepted as sufficient evidence. Tnde-
pendently of any difference in the physical, and perhaps even chemical relations of the
A 3upposed flesh-forming nitrogenous compounds in animal food, which may render them,
Sat least in limited quantity, more easily available to the purposes of the system than the
E asumed analogous vegetable products, it is at any rate clear, that the main and charac-
'& teristic distinction between a Bread—and a mired Bread and Meat diet—consists, not
Sonly in the quantitatively higher relation of the respiratory and fat-forming capacity to
pa given amount of assumed flesh-forming material in the latter, but in the fact, that the
