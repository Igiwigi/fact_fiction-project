independently from the latter.

Stages showing a saddle or disk of superficial blastomeres were observed by Sedgwick and
Purcell, but both considered these cells to be ectodermal only, while in fact they give rise
to all germ layers. Purcell as well as Sedgwick confused the non-nucleated cytoplasmic
spheres of early stages (see Sedgwick 1885, figures 7, 8 and 10 en., plate 31, and figures 62 to
67, plate 37 shown here) with the ‘large vacuolated cells’ derived from the edges of the saddle
of blastomeres (see Sedgwick, figures 11, 12, 13 and 15 en., plate 31 (figures 7, 11 and 12 are
of P. balfouri and figures 8, 10, 13 and 15 are of P. capensis) and the figures on plates 37 and
39 of stages i to k of P. balfourt and figure 120, plate 41 of P capensis here shown).

Sedgwick further supposed that both these components represented endoderm; the large
vacuolated cells in P. capensis do in fact give endoderm, but not in P. balfouri where the
definitive endoderm does not arise until later (see p. 512). He accounted for the nuclei of his
‘endodermal’ cells by supposing that they arose de novo in the non-nucleated cytoplasmic
spheres, so giving the nucleated large vacuolated cells which he correctly observed forming ‘a
ring-like mass applied all round the edge of the ectodermal patch’ (1886). Although Sedg-
wick gives a long description and discussion of the development of ‘endoderm’ from the
cytoplasmic spheres, he says (1887) of segmentation that, apart from the superficial blasto-
meres, ‘the breaking up of the rest of the ovum into irregular masses cannot be regarded as
a process in any way related to cleavage, inasmuch as the nucleus takes no part in it’, and
in a footnote, ‘This process is probably identical with the formation of the non-nucleate
yolk spheres found in many arthropoda.’ The former conclusion is correct, but applies
more forcibly to the facts of development here described than to the version arrived at by
Sedgwick. Whether the cytoplasmic spheres represent yolk spheres is uncertain. They are
