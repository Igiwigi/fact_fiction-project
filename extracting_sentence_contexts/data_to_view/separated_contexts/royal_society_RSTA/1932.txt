of the initial value in a few minutes. This percentage, however, diminishes as the load
is decreased. These facts have an important bearing on stress determinations from
observations of artificial double refractions in celluloid. (4) The stretch of the celluloid follows laws closely similar to those of the optical
retardation, the initial stretch being also approximately proportional to the applied load. (5) The retardation r and stretch ยง are connected in each case by a linear relation

r = aT-+ 8,

T being the applied load in each case.
