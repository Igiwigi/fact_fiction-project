The dorsal arcualia compress the perichordal tube to such an extent that apparently
they appear to rest direct on the notochordal sheath and so also on the hypochordal
(EMELIANOFF, 1925), but the whole notochord in this region as elsewhere is surrounded
by the perichordal tube as we have already stated.

One can easily find that the former workers from GEGENBAUR (1862) to SCHAINSLAND
(1906) had the idea that there are two dorsolateral cartilages forming the dorsal arcualia,
and a ventral representing the heemal arch element throughout the whole length of the
vertebral column. Their descriptions of the formation of the vertebral column can only
tally to a certain extent with the structure of the anterior portion of the urostyle, so
that one cannot imagine that these workers ever cut sections of the actual trunk vertebra.
As a matter of fact, ScHwEGMANN (1884) has given two figures, one for the trunk vertebra
and another for the urostyle, and they resemble each other, the only variation being in
their size.

In the urostyle region there are two pairs of dorsal arcualia at the anterior portion and
a hypochordal cartilage starts from the beginning of the urostyle and continues up to
its hinder end. It has a bulky posterior portion where there is no neural arch or
cartilagmous dorsal arcualia. The spinal cord in this portion is enveloped by
connective tissue arches.

Gavow (1896) has stated in the case of frog that the anterior portion of the urostyle has
two lateral basidorsals and a pair of basiventrals (or hypochordals) for two vertebrae, the
so-called 10th and 11th. The recent worker EMELIANOFF (1925) has not contradicted him.
