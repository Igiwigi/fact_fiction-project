Any attempt to homologise the corpus striatum of Ornithorhynchus with that of
; either reptiles or marsupials is made exceedingly difficult, because that body in Platypus,

particularly in the adult, resembles nothing on earth so much as itself. The genesis of
| its peculiarity of form is probably coincident with the marked hypertrophy of the ventral
and medial nuclei of the thalamus. Some comparative neurologists would say that the
thalamus has pushed the corpus striatum quite out of place, a slightly naive way of
expressing the simple morphological fact that the corpus striatum fits the lateral peri-
phery of the dorsal thalamic complex very like a skull cap fits a bald head. Such an
explanation of position carries with it the initial supposition that the growing corpus
striatum is a completely plastic body, susceptible only to pressure without, generating
none within by its own power of cell differentiation and hypertrophy. Were it true for
the striatum, it should be true also for the cortex.
