The SASTRA Ramanujan Prize has a more stringent age
limit of 32, and so has recognized brilliant mathematicians even earlier in their careers. It is no exaggeration to say that the winners of the SASTRA Ramanujan Prizes have also shaped
the development of mainstream mathematics and will continue to do so in the years ahead. The
fact that the SASTRA laureates have subsequently won major prizes with a hallowed tradition


is a testimony to this; for instance, Fields Medal Winners Manjul Bhargava (2014), Peter Scholze 0 |
(2018) and Akshay Venkatesh (2018) were all earlier SASTRA Prize Winners. Data accessibility. This article has no additional data. :s
