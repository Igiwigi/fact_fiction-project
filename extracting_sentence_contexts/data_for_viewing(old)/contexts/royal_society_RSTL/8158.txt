S cylinder from the leaf-bundles, we can understand the possibility that the downward
E prolongations of them would not reach the roots. But, as T have illustrated in my last

rootlets. Hence it would appear that the nutritive fluids were absorbed by the rootlets
and transmitted up the stem primarily by the vessels of the exogenous zone ; but in
order that those fluids should reach the leaves, they had to be transferred, by some lateral
