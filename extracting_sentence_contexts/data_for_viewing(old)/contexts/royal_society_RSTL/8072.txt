the fourth power of e being neglected—a formula which may be applied without sen-
sible error to any orifice of an approximately circular form. In fact for a given area the
circle is the figure which gives a minimum value to c, and in the neighbourhood of the
minimum the variation is slow.
Next, consider the case of two circular orifices, If sufficiently far apart they act

independently of each other, and the value of c for the pair is the simple sum of the
separate values, as may be seen either from the law of multiple arcs by considering c
as the electric conductivity between the outside and inside of the reservyoir, or from the
interpretation of M in (23). The first method applies to any kind of openings with or
