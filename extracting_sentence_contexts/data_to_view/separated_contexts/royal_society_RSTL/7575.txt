The bright lines which have been observed in several sfars, especially in the remark-
able one in Corona, the outburst of which was spectroscopically watched by Mr. HuGGxs
in 1866, shows us that under certain conditions of constitution a chromosphere may be
a part of the regular star-economy, and be liable to changes more or less great, and
effected with more or less rapidity. The continuous observation of the sun's chro-
mosphere may therefore lead to a knowledge of many important facts. It is remarkable that in the outburst in the star in Corona, two of the lines of the
chromosphere were coincident with C and F, and that two other lines were visible. If,
therefore, either or both of these lines be due to hydrogen, we must regard that star,
leaving the density of the enyelope out of consideration, as being of lower temperature
than our sun.
