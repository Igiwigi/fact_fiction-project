But then we are met with the
difficulty that the intensity of the phosphorescent illumination in similar cases
increased by the introduction of an air-spark in spite of the diminution of the quantity
of the discharge. A possible explanation of this law is obtained by supposing s
the effect on the radiometer is proportional to the momentum with which the ps
leave the terminal while the phosphorescence depends on their energy. This won
mean that a diminution of quantity diminishes the number of particles leaving bn
terminal while the increase of tension increases the velocity ; such increase bein
insufficient, to prevent the total momentum of the particles from being decreased
the introduction of an air-spark, but sufficing to cause a marked increase in their tot

energy. ,
It is a very significant fact that the intermittence of the phosphorescence ©

'at the negative terminal is of the nature of a response, and is presumably of a much
