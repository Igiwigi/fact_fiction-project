If, therefore, a film was half black and half coloured it would differ

inappreciably from a cylinder if the difference of surface tension was only 1 per cent.
The.pressure, however, would have altered by 0:5 per cent., and if the film were now
put into communication with another which was coloured throughout an appreciable
change in the principal diameters would take place. This is evident from the fact
that, if the change in the pressure exerted by the first film had been due to its surface
tension having altered throughout by 0:5 per cent., the difference in the principal
diameters would have been 0451/2=0'225 mm. It follows, therefore, that if two
films are in communication, and if the surface tension of a part of one differs slightly
from that of the remainder, the asymmetry of this film is s8mall compared with the
Lhange produced in the principal diameters of the two films. We may, thereſore, as a
Yrst approximation to the truth, regard the sensitiveness of an experiment in which
Part only of the film is black as proportional to dp/dp”,
