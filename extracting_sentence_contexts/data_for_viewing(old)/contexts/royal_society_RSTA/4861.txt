this structure. It must be said, however, that so far it is the loop integrands that have been
completely transformed by the new developments. Actually performing the (regularized) loop


integrals to extract amplitudes is another matter. However, several different approaches using
twistor variables are being undertaken, for example by Lipstein & Mason [44].

There is a general question about how the breaking of conformal symmetry enters into
fundamental physics, which has been a feature of the twistor philosophy from the outset. In
standard space-time physics, both this symmetry and the breaking of it are obscured. Once it
comes into clear focus with twistor coordinates, one may hope to distinguish and inter-relate
the different aspects of conformal symmetry breaking. There is the breaking of symmetry due
to the fact that amplitudes are measured ‘at infinity’. Length scales associated with infrared and
ultraviolet regularization also require breaking conformal symmetry. Gravity breaks conformal
symmetry in a different way. The Higgs field, in the Standard Model, is the source of mass, which
also breaks the symmetry. We now also need to take seriously the enormous length scale given by
the cosmological constant. All these topics are on the agenda.

One of the approaches to regulating divergences involves studying a ‘deformation’ of =
amplitudes which retains conformal (and indeed Yangian) symmetry. The authors of a recent :

This is over-generous, since in the early days there was no systematic way of thinking about loop- :
level amplitudes at all, whereas now the Grassmannian provides such a framework. Nevertheless, [4
