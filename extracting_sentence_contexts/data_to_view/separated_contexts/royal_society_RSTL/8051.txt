As exogenous stems grow, the pith gradually contracts, and what
cells remain do 80 in a final condition that rather represents effete structures than active
cells filled with vigorous protoplasm. Yet, though the medulla becomes thus altered,
and its primary mission a thing of the past, the medullary rays continue to grow and
