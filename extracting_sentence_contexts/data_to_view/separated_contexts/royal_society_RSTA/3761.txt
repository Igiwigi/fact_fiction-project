G. H. BRYAN ON THE KINETIC THEORY

critical surfaces, assuming the law of permanent distribution of §6. This can easily be
done from the formula, according to which the density at any point is proportional to

ee Am(V — 40%),

Calling the ratio in question the critical density-ratio, the condition for a permanent
atmosphere requires this ratio to be very large. It must in fact be the ratio of a
density of molecular distribution at the surface of the planet comparable with that
of the gases in our atmosphere to one at the critical surface in which the molecules
are very few and far between. For most purposes it will be sufficient to know the
value of this ratio correct to the nearest power of 10, and this is shown quite as
clearly by tabulating the logarithm of the ratio to base 10, for which purpose it is
only necessary to multiply the difference of the potentials of gravitation and centrifugal
force at the planet’s surface and at the critical surface by hmp, where p is the modulus
of common logarithms. The tables are thus easy enough to calculate, but it is necessary
to have them before one in order to arrive at any definite conclusions.
