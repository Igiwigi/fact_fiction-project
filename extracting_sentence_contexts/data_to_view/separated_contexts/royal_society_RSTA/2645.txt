A further assumption on the azimuthal symmetry of the wear suffered by the pipe is
considered, allowing the projection of the two-dimensional histograms into one single coordinate:
the radius of the POCA scattering centre. The resulting distributions can be seen in figure 3. This
projection confirms the fact that the outer pipe face is easy to identify, while the inner face is more
difficult, providing a soft gradient towards zero instead of a steep fall at the radial position of the
wall.
