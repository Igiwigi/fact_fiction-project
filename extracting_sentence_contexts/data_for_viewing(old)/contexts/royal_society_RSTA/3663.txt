of the terrestrial value, which seemed to confound a previously emerging view that Jupiter-family
comets (like 67P) should have the Earth-like values. In fact, for a number of reasons, it is beginning
to look like there is no obvious difference between the D/H values of water in Jupiter-family
comets and other Oort cloud comets. Rather, comets, in general, appear to have D/H values that
span a range of one to three times the terrestrial value, with the exact value being a reflection
of the distance from the Sun that the comet condensed [7]. The relevance for studies of the
origins of the inner planets is that, as things stand, the elevated D/H ratios in comets mean that
they could constitute only a relatively minor proportion of the water on these bodies, including
the Earth [8-10].

The noble gas (isotopic) compositions of 67P have the potential to offer further constraints
on the role of comets in the development of the surface layers of planets like the Earth. These
are difficult measurements to make and are, in fact, still being acquired. Initial results from
argon are given in Balsiger et al. [11] and confirm the fact that comets like 67P were not a
significant contributor to water on Earth. However, it may transpire that isotope ratios can be
used to constrain the relative inputs of noble gases to the different surface reservoirs on the
planet (e.g. the atmosphere as distinct from the hydrosphere). This is important because it gives
insights into the significance of comets in delivering species other than water to the surface of
the early Earth. In this regard, carbon-bearing components are of considerable importance. This
includes organic compounds, of course, but also more abundant components such as CHy, CO,
CO, etc.
