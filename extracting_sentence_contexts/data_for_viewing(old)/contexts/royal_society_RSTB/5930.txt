explain the appearance of the wound as seen in sections of apices pickled 3 or 4 weeks
after the operation ; for in the latter sections the upper part of the wound appeared
as a small V-shaped scar (see fig. 11, No. 24.D), and this can be readily understood,

Fic. 3—A. Diagram of transverse section of apex immediately after operation. The wound is shown by
a radial line. B. Diagram of transverse section of apex about 7 days after operation. The sides of
the wound have gaped apart; the wound meristem is shown by lines radiating inwards from the
wound,

since the two sides must have gaped apart some time before. The very small relative
size of the wound scar in these sections was obviously due to the fact that its absolute
size remained the same while the surrounding tissues went on growing. In two or three
experiments, for instance No. 5, fig. 5, D, the wound was seen to project on a protuber-
ance, which may have been formed by the activity of the wound meristem.

(4) Terminology and Brief Classification of Results.

The primordia will be named in the same way as before. Those visible at the time
of operation are P,, Ps, etc., P, being the youngest : those arising after the operation are
I,, 1,, etc., I, being the first to arise. The “ genetic spiral” is a line drawn through
successive primordia in the order in which they arise. The direction along this spiral
towards the successively younger leaves will be called the “ anodic ” direction, and the
opposite direction the “ kathodic.” The operation divided the presumptive area of I,
