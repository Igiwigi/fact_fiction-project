CURRENTS IN INFINITE PLATES AND SPHERICAL SHELLS. 315

where @1, wg, wg are the angular velocities of the element at z, y, 22 We cannot,
therefore, look upon þ as the potential of free electricity ; in fact it is easy to see that
there will be no free electricity inside it, just as when it, was at rest, Tf the conductor
be symmetrical about an axis, and revolve about it sufficiently long for the currents to
become steady, the total current will become identical with the conduction current, and
there will be no flow across the surface, We may then take at every point of the

gurface
lu+mv+nw=0. The triple integrals in the expressions for F, G, H are then to be taken only
aF
an”
passing across the gurface ; and ontside, F, G, H xatisfy the equations

thronghout the conductor, and we shall have as before F and &e., continuous in

T2H=0; 7 G=0; 73H=0:

The special problems which are solved in the present paper depend for their solution
on certain properties of the vector potential ; and it will therefore not be oub of place
to devote a little space to their preliminary discussion. We hall thereby gain a
clearer insight into the subsequent analysis,

The vector potential.
