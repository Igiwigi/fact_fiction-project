cycling. Importantly, these protein-derived amino acids have
the ability to suppress the deleterious effects of nutrient star-
vation, leading to albumin-dependent proliferation and
growth. Interestingly, catabolism of macropinocytosed serum
albumin contributes substantially to PDAC intracellular
amino acid pools, even in the absence of amino acid deprivation
[35]. An important avenue of further study is determining
whether amino acid deprivation can enhance macropinocytic
uptake and to what extent macropinocytosis contributes to
cellular fitness under nutrient-replete conditions.

The evaluation of the role of macropinocytosis in PDAC
tumour growth took advantage of the fact that macropinocy-
tosis is unique in relation to other endocytic pathways,
because it is sensitive to 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) amiloride
(EIPA) and other amiloride analogues that inhibit Na*/H*
exchange [50]. Miniaturized plasma exchange experiments
demonstrated in situ that live tumours actively engage
in macropinocytosis and break down albumin [51]. This
albumin catabolism was suppressed by EIPA and resulted
in the modulation of amino acid levels within the tumour.
Importantly, EIPA administration in animals bearing
KRAS-mutant xenograft tumours resulted in an attenuation
of tumour growth, and in some cases regression, relative to
vehicle-only controls [6]. The observed effects of EIPA on
