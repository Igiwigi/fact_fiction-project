fy) SBOE Hite lag ites 50 23 Bled to death from carotid.

Post-mortem.—The portal, pulmonary and systemic circulations and the heart
were free from any clotting. The blood was incoagulable and bright red in colour.
There were well marked sub-pericardial, endocardial, sub-pleural and peritoneal
hemorrhages.

Here we have a steady fall of pressure with greatly increased excursus of the
pulse, the heart continuing to beat steadily throughout, and was still contracting well
at the end of the experiment. The adrenal chloride caused a marked but temporary
rise of pressure. The usual slow failure of respiration secondary to the failure of the
blood pressure was showing itself when the experiment was stopped. A central
vaso-motor paralysis would account for all the facts observed, while the following
experiment affords further strong support to this view of the action of the poison.
