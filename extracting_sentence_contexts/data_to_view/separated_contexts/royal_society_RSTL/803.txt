This may be proved without difficulty from the known
form of the integral of the equation of a recurring series,
Now since the values of *A_, ?A.., &c. are all expressible by
means of ”A_ as above described, it is easily seen that these
are all in like manner circulating functions of a similar form,
and since

we may neglect in the expression of "A, all: those terms
which have not S, for a multiplier; in that of ?A, , all but
those multiplied by S,__. ; and 80 on, This is a simplification
of considerable moment, and will enable us in any assigned
case to dispense with the troublesome and complicated pro-
cess of determining *A,, &c. by elimination from (C) after

the relation between the constants which enter into these
