other component is everywhere perpendicular to these meridian planes. The vortex
aggregates will be moving with rectilinear translation through the fluid with a
velocity calculable, when the distribution of vortex motion is known, by HetmMHotrz’s
method. Bring the aggregate to rest by impressing everywhere a velocity equal and
opposite to the velocity of translation. The motion then consists of a flow up through
the centre in the direction of previous translation, the fluid then streaming (in this
most, general case) in spirals round a certain circle. The circle may conveniently be
called the equatorial axis of the aggregate. The line of symmetry through the
centre in the direction of translation may then be termed the polar axis, Whether
awe deal with ring-shaped or singly connected aggregates, the surfaces p will always
She ring-shaped inside. In fact they are so also at the boundary, for the surface value
of w really consists in the latter case of the outer boundary together with the
lar axis.
& 3. Conceive now the aggregate divided up into a large number of ring-surfaces
riven by values of a parameter w differing by dy, and confine attention to what is
Going on between the two surfaces ys and w + dp. We shall suppose wp to increase as
Bie pass from the outside inwards. Let dn denote the distance at a point between
othe surfaces yp and y + dip, dn to be measured also inwards. In the shell considered ,
“Sthe lines of flow will be spiral, and the vortex-filaments also spirals, as indicated in
“the figure, the thin line Pf representing a line of flow, the thick Pv a vortex-filament,
