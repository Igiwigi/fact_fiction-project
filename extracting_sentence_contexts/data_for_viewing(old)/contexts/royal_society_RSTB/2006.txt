proteids as evidenced by the production of opacity.

We have employed this salt and confirmed KiHne's observation. The muscle
shortens greatly on being immersed in this solution, and becomes very opaque. It
presents exactly the appearance of a muscle which has been heated to 40°C. If,
now, that same muscle be gradually heated, as in our experiments, we find that
practically no heat-contractions occur, and such as do occur are probably due to quite
small quantities of proteid still uncoagulated.

Ammonium sulphocyanide we found to exert no effect upon the production of heat
contractions. Thus the action of potassium sulphocyanide favours the view that
heat-contraction is caused by the purely physical precipitation of a proteid by heat.
Other facts which also point to the same conclusion are: (1) The heat-contraction
produced in rigor-mortis muscle ; and (2) The contractions produced in fresh muscle
at about 47°C. and 58°C. It is, moreover, probable that the precipitation of the
proteids in one insoluble form during rigor-mortis is the sole physical cause forming
the basis of that contraction.

On the other view, viz., that the physical is accompanied by a chemical change
which latter is the true cause of the actual contraction, we have the series of
observations with regard to the production of an acid reaction during heat-
contraction. This change was first observed by Du Bors Reymonp, and confirmed
by Kisune* in many particulars, though he notes that a muscle in heat-rigor need
not show an acid reaction. He moreover found that with the heat-coagulation of
frog's muscle-plasma the reaction might or might not become acid. In our
