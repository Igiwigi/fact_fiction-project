aborted seeds.

The reduction of homotypic correlation in the case of the fertility of pods may be
profitably compared with the like reduction which we find in the case of the
coefficients of inheritance of fertility and fecundity in man and the horse.t

Other points worth noting, I think, in our results are those of Table LI., which
gives the correlation between ovules and ripe and aborted seeds. As we might
anticipate, the more ripe the fewer aborted seeds, and vice versd. The correlation is
negative, high for the â€˜everlasting pea, remarkably low for the tare vetch. It is
interesting to see that the correlation between the ovules and either ripe or aborted
seeds is not very high. A large number of ovules not necessarily connoting either
a very large number of ripe or of aborted seeds. In fact, in the case of the ever-
lasting pea, the number of ovules has very small influence indeed on the number
of seeds which ripen. In the tare vetch only is the relationship more marked,
Professor F. O. Onrver tells me that in certain cases evolution appears to be tending
in the direction of the pod containing one ripe seed only. It seems, therefore, that
such relations as are indicated in Table LI. (and others of a like kind, for further
observations ought certainly to be made) may be useful in indicating the degree of
fixity between the number of ovules and the number of ripe or aborted seed which
are ultimately to be found in the seed vessel.

While the ovules have the least and the aborted seeds the greatest variability, as
measured by the coefficient of variation, the ovules have the most and the aborted
seeds the least homotypic correlation, This might at first sight appear to be opposed
