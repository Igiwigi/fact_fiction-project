of light were apparent. The conclusion appears to be that through some process, at present
unknown, the patterns produced by stimulating several cones simultaneously by a point of
light fail to reach consciousness. Some evidence in favour of this conclusion may be obtained
as follows: three white test objects were prepared, a square with 8 mm. sides, an oblong
with 6 by 11 mm. sides, and a trefoil having about the same area. Over the plotting-board
of the micro-stimulator was placed a piece of black velvet so as to obtain as dark a back-

ground as possible. The test objects were placed on this, and they were illuminated by an
electric spot-light. They were examined singly and together. It was found that their shapes
could not be recognized, in fact, it was difficult to distinguish them apart. Now there can
be little doubt that diffraction and the aberrations, both of the apparatus and of the eye,
cause the distribution of light on the retina to differ materially from a geometrical image
in the case of each one of these test objects. None the less, material differences in the shapes
of the images should exist. Yet none were noticed by the observer. The conclusion arrived
at previously is confirmed, namely, that not only do the patterns produced by the stimula-
tion of the retinal cones by a point of light fail to reach consciousness, but actual patterns
of similar form as well.

Thus, there appears to be some process taking place in the visual pathway which smooths
out the irregular shapes of objects when they subtend small angles at the eye. This loss of
shape is a disadvantage. But at the same time the process eliminates the spurious shapes
which objects, e.g. stars, would undergo owing to the arrangement of the receptors of the
