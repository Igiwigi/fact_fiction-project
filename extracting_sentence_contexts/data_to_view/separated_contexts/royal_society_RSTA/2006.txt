d,, (1)
= 51731°03—23899'08 = 27831°95 and separation that of the D satellite or 1165. In
searching for this allowance will have to be made for the prevalence of displacement
in the lower orders. As a fact, however, this only appears for m = 3 in F,, although in
F, there are considerable signs of it. The following table with succeeding notes
contains the data, including also those for the corresponding F series ; also for certain
lines which show a separation about 150, and which may probably be the analogue of
the 1864 X series. We shall denote this last set by dashing the letters.
