It is estimated that in some of the pregnant
animals the ovaries contained over 200 g of luteal tissue. For some time after the corpus
luteum is fully developed, the luteal cells are large, rounded and sometimes binucleate,
and the cytoplasm has a frothy appearance. They present, in fact, the structure charac-
teristic of this type of cell in the fully developed condition (figures 23a and 24a). But in
most of the available specimens the cytoplasm of the luteal cells is occupied by large
spherical globules which stain black with osmic acid and which appear as vacuoles in
preparations in which they are not preserved (figure 26, plate 8). This very marked
degree of vacuolation is evidently a process of fatty degeneration, but nevertheless appears
to represent a functional phase of the corpus luteum which persists for a long time.
