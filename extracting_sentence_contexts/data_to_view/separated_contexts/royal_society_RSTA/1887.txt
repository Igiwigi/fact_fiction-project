The alloy of this formula appears* to have the lowest melting point, and it is
a quite mobile liquid at room temperatures. In some of the early experiments an alloy
of higher melting point having the initial composition NaK was used. This fact will
be mentioned when it is necessary to refer to those experi-
ments. Where no specific reference to the composition of the
alloy is made, it can be assumed that it was close to that
given by the formula NaK,. There is reason to believe that as
the alloy is used the potassium is consumed faster than the
sodium, with a consequent increase in the viscosity of the
alloy.
