The first of these two cycles agrees in character with the preceding ones ; we are,
in fact, still dealing with annealed, not drawn wire. But the cycle 0-10-0 begins
the wire's passage from the annealed to the hard state, and the curves of magnetigm
exhibit a corresponding transition. The next stage in the loading, up to 11 kilos,
caused a decided drawing out, and with it a complete transformation of the curyes into
the form which has been already described ($ 71) as characteristic of a stretched piece,
and substantially the ame form was retained with further successive additions of load.
