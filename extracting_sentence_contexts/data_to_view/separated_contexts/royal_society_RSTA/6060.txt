The expansion terms are the result of quantum effects computed within the
context of QFT in curved space-time. For the present universe, pyac greatly simplifies and it
appears as the sum of a dominant term plus a dynamical component which varies as ~vHP nt,
where v is a small (dimensionless) and computable coefficient (playing the role of 6-function


coefficient of the VED running) and mp, is the usual Planck mass (mp; = Gy! 2), Such a result
perfectly fulfils the above condition of being compatible to a great extent with the ACDM, as it
entails only a small departure from the main term. No less remarkable is the fact that the quantum
vacuum is predicted to be mildly dynamical, and such dynamics can be effectively evaluated from
first principles since the parameter v can be accounted for using QFT in curved space-time. As long as the QFT vacuum approach proposed here turns out to be free from the
awkward ~m'4 effects that are obtained in oversimplified renormalization treatments which prove
inappropriate for the CCP, the renormalized result which ensues appears theoretically distinct

and tantalizing. Remember that the CCP [16] is one of the hardest and long-standing mysteries of : S
theoretical physics, and proves to be a most serious obstruction to reconcile theoretical cosmology 1S
with particle physics [23].
