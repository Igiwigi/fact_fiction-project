This
fact enables us to determine the lattice function and the sub-lattice functions
derivable from the whole of the permutations of the letters a,”«/*...@,?* when we
may suppose the exponents p;, Ps, ..., P, to be in descending order of magnitude and
establishes also that these functions are invariant for any permutation of Pyy Ps +15 Pn

were under view. ‘Taking the lattice corresponding to «;*a,’«, and arranging 6

For the whole of the permutations derived as above from the lattice which are, in
fact, the whole of the permutations of «,°a,’«; we derive a permutation function

such that the generating function sought is

and this we know otherwise to have the value
