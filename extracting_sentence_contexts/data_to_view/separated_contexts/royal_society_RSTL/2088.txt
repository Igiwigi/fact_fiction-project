Even were it otherwise, the texture
of the hell is 80 soft, that it could make no impression upon
the stone without being itself acted on ; and the effect of this
would be permanent, because superficial injuries of the shell
are never repaired. | But nothing} of this kind'is met with. I have even found a Saxicava fixed between two others, which

a third. of its proper. thickness ; yet neither of the three
showed the slightest mark of friction, and the cuticle of the
sides in contact was as perfect as usual. But independent of the presumprion afforded by the soft-
ness and smoothness of the shell, and by the absence of any
arrangement of muscles which might employ it with effect
had it been strong enough to act on hard stone, it is easy to
collect facts affording ample proof that the shell cannot, be
the instrument of penetration. I have a specimen, of calca-
reous stone of extraordinary hardness, containing small
masses of silex, some of which project into the holes formed
by Saxicava rugosa, and Venerupis irus., /The lime has been
smoothly cleared around the base of these projecting portions
from situations with which the shell could not possibly have
come into contact. In another specimen, in which the lime
is mixed with a large proportion of clay, there is a small
round stratum of stone entirely argillaceous, and not one-
twentieth of an inch in thickness.
