CAYLEY ON A NEW AUXILIARY EQUATION IN

where -
Soe*=a%þ+at+a3 + ai +05=7: (6*—2ac),
and thence, observing also that o+7/ =>
w0(=ofofsfoffo')=52*f— 5al*e+b*+90'r7,
or as this equation may also be written,

4a0=(Sac—20) —ba(r—r')*;

and hence the Resolvent Product 0(=fwfsfo*fa') being determined by an equation of
the sixth order, this is also the case with the function (7—7'P. |

5. But the twelve functions +(7—7') can be divided into two ets of six functions each,
$0 that each set is determined by an equation of the sixth order involving a single qua-
dratic radical. This was in fact suggested to me by Mr. HarLEy's equation in #; for in
the case considered 7+? was =0, or 2?=t—t', and the equation in # was presumably the
particular form of the equation for 4(#—?7') in the general case. But it will presently
appear in what manner the conclusion should have been arrived at & prior.
