6.G—-3,H =0, 6,G—3,H=0, 3,K—-3,L=0, 36,K—é6,L = 0,
or, what is the same thing, simply
6G = 3H and d,G = dH
at all distances along O’a’.

If we confine attention to the two cases above, we see that in the first, where the
emergent origin is the principal focus, G = 0, and therefore 3,G = 6,H without the
intervention of 8 = 0, and similarly in the second, when the emergent and original
origins are conjugate normal foci, H = 0, and therefore 3,G = d,H ; the interpretation
of these is the same, namely, that the comatic displacement is twice the comatic
radius—“ comatic displacement” being used to denote the expression $d? (3,H +3,G)
as on p. 168—a well-known fact, usually put in the form that in the absence of
astigmatism the successive comatic circles have two common tangents inclined to one
another at 60 degrees. The other term remains as the true content of Perzvat’s
condition. Its interpretation may be put in different forms; as, apart from spherical

aberration, at the normal*focal plane of any image, the longitudinal axis of the focal

ellipse is three times its transverse axis, which is an interpretation of the expressions
of p. 166, for df” = 0,

8b’ = ... cos pd [4$d*,G + $8" (3,G+23,H)], de’ = ... sin gd [$d*,G + 38°9,G],

of the first case, or the corresponding expression of the second case; or again, the
