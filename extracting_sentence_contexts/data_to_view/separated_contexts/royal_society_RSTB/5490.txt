The opening leading from the uterus into the
tube is hidden among the membranous folds at the upper end of the uterine cavity. This opening in the rabbit, as in the sow (ANDERSEN, 1928), is sometimes provided
with an incomplete papilla projecting into the uterus. ANDERSEN was unable to inject
coloured fluid from the uterus of the rabbit into the tube, but I found this relatively
easy to accomplish, as in fact ANDERSEN herself did in the sheep and the sow. Injection
in the opposite direction through this passage in the rabbit was also easily performed. Whether the freedom of this passage varies with the physiological state of the animal,
as suggested by the work of Lr (1925, a; 1925, b), remains to be ascertained

vagina.
