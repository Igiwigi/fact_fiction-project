Now, the
reason appeared why, in the former case, the crystals of antimony did not oscillate
(2512.) ; and why, also, they went up to their position of rest with a dead set ; for the
currents produced by the motion are just those which tend to stop the motion
(2329.)*; and though the magneerystallic force was sufficient to make the crystal
move and point, yet the very motion s0 produced generated the current which reacted
upon the tendency to motion, and 80 caused the mass to advance towards its position
of rest as if it moved in a thick fluid.

2515. Having this additional knowledge respecting the arrest and reyulsion of the
antimony (effects dependent upon its superior conducting power, in this compact
crystalline state, as compared with bismuth), one has no difficulty in identifying the
magnecrystallic force of this metal with that of the former, and the correspondence
of the results in all essential characters and particulars. In most of the pieces of
crystals of antimony the force seemed less than in bismuth, but the fact may not
really be 80, for the inductive current action just described, tends to hide the mag-
necrystallic phenomena.

2516. Different pieces of antimony also seern to differ from each other in their
setting force, and also in their tendency to exhibit revulsive effects; but these dif-
ferences are either only apparent, or may easily be explained. The arresting and
revulsive action depends much upon the continuity of the mass, 80 that one large
piece shows it much better than several small pieces, and these again better than a

* Any one who wishes to form a sufficient idea of the arresting powers of these induced currents, should
take a lump of solid copper, approaching to the cubical or globular form, weighing from a quarter to half a
pound; should suspend it by a long thread, give it a rapid rotation, and then introduce it, spinning, into the
magnetic field of the electro-magnet ; he will find its motion to be instantly stopped ; and if he further tries to
$pin it, whilst in the field, will find it impoxsible to do 80,
