The method of taking the electrometer curves and their degree of accuracy is
discussed later.

The dotted curve represents the indirect curve, while the continuous one represents
the ordinary capillary curve. In this particular experiment it apparently happened
that for some accidental reason (such as difference in purity of the mereury of the
large and small electrodes) the “natural” potential difference at the small electrode
was appreciably different from that at the large. In consequence of this, the surface
tension of the small electrode began to increase immediately the connection between
it and the large electrode was broken. As I have subsequently observed, this is an
effect which can be obviated when due care is taken, with pure mercury and a
solution of uniform concentration. The phenomenon does not affect the conclusions
in the present case, but in fact rather increases the interest attaching to the
observations. When the electrodes were joined by a short wire, the surface tension
was different from what it was when they were joined by the graphite resistance.
The reading in the latter case was not appreciably affected by reversing the resistance,
so it could be assumed that the graphite did not introduce any appreciable E.M.F.
into the circuit.

At first the indirect readings for a given external E.M.F. give higher values for
the surface tension than the direct. The curves cut one another at an E.M.F.
corresponding to about 0°28 volt, so that for this E.M.F., the surface tension assumed
by the mercury is the same whether the E.M.F. is applied directly or through a very
high resistance. Hence, when the surface tension at the capillary has this particular
value, there can be no appreciable continuous current through the electrometer. It
