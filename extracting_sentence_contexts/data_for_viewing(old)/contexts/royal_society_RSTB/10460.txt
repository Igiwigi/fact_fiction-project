(c) DNA repair

An old idea for a potential benefit of transformation is that
acquired DNA is used as a substrate for genome repair
[29,30]. Early experimental evidence indicated an immediate
benefit of DNA uptake on transformant survival relative
to the remainder of the population in B. subtilis [30-32].
However, these earlier results were countered in the same
species by evidence that genotoxic stress did not induce com-
petence [33], as predicted by the original idea. A more recent
extension of this ‘DNA repair hypothesis’ proposes that
transformation is a general stress response [34]. This idea is
supported by the fact that some, but not all [35], naturally
transformable human pathogens such as S. pneumoniae,
Legionella pneumophila and Helicobacter pylori lack a general
SOS response and that DNA damaging agents, including
some antibiotics, induce competence in these species
[34,36,37]. Current evidence suggests, however, that the benefits
of competence induction in these species may be unlinked from
the effects of transformation per se (i.e. DNA uptake and inte-
gration) [38,39]. Thus, although these reports reveal that at
least some forms of stress can induce competence, they do not
always provide evidence that this response is adaptive, nor
provide clear indications of the mechanisms underlying these
benefits. Furthermore, they do not take into account the
