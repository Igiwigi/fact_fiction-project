As is well known, the left division of the 4A—V bundle in the dog passes over and
lies on the muscular septum and, appearing in an almost constant position a little
way beneath the junction of two aortic cusps—the right ventral cusp (from which
the right coronary artery springs) and the dorsal cusp (from which no artery arises)—
it occupies a purely sub-endocardial position, and quickly spreads and flattens itself
out to form a fan (see fig. 7), the outlines and many details of which are clearly
visible in the freshly opened heart. The borders of this fan are continued into its
two most prominent subdivisions,* the ventral and dorsal branches, which run a
g free course from septum to the bases of the corresponding papillary muscle. Usually
8 originating as single free strands, they are subject to minor variations. Near their
terminations in the sub-endocardial spaces overlying the papillary muscles they
3 break up into a complex basketwork. These chief facts are illustrated in the
5 accompanying diagrams, where free strands encased in endocardium are indicated by

iP unbroken lines, and where the remaining visible outlines of the fun are represented
4 by broken lines.

e In cutting the left division I use a small tenotomy knife, introducing it, as did
3 Eprrncer and Rorapercer, from the ventral and left surface of the left ventricle.
= The point chosen is the erutch formed by the descending branch of the left coronary
g artery at its union with its chief branch, an artery which runs down toward the left
3 and dorsal surfaces of the heart’s apex. The knife is driven cleanly in between the
gs two arteries, ina dorsal direction, with an inclination to the right; it enters the
5 cavity $-1 em. below the left anterior aortic cusp (see fig. 7), and in the space
