When a sufficiently strong crust had formed, the dish was lifted up and the still
molten metal was poured out through the free corner. When cool, it was found that
a certain portion round the edges of the dish had solidified to the full depth of the

metal, but that in the centre there was simply the upper crust, about $ inch to
4 inch in thickness, and this could be easily cut away from the surrounding portions.
The crystals forming the erust fell away from one another to a certain extent when
unsupported by the metal beneath. This was due to the well-known fact that the
metallic impurities form a eutectic with part of the lead and collect in the crystalline
boundaries. This eutectic has a lower freezing-point than the pure lead, and hence
remains molten after the main mass has solidified. â€˜lhe boundaries are, therefore,
lines of weakness, and the crystals tend to fall apart when the supporting metal
below is poured away.

The upper surface of the crust which had been in contact with the air was, apart
from the skeletal markings, fairly plane, but the lower surface was covered with
numerous small spiky projections, these being regular in shape and position over each
individual crystal, but varying from one crystal to another. Fig. 4 (Plate 2) shows such
a surface natural size, and the various crystalline grains can be easily distinguished by
their different textures. Tt will be seen that in some cases certain spikes are raised
