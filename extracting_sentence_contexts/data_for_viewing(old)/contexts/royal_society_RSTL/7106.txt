affect the supply of nutrient matter distributed by modifying the calibre of the vessels,
and hence regulate the supply of blood which passes to the capillaries. The nerves

I believe really exert their influence upon the contractile muscular coat of the small

arteries and veins alone, and do not act directly upon any other tissues.


448 PROFESSOR BEALE'S NEW OBSERVATIONS UPON THE

The Nerves.

With regard to the trunks of the nerves, I remark the following facts of im
portance '— |
1. That the bundle of nerve-fibres distributed to a papilla always divides into two
bundles which pursue opposite directions. The division of the bundle may take place
just at the base of the papilla, or at some distance from it, but it always occurs (Plate
Pn fig. 1).
. Fine pale nerve-fibres pass from the same trunk of dark-bordered fibres as that
W hich gives off the bundle of nerves to the papilla. The fine fibres ramify—
a. Amongst the muscular fibres of the tongue (Plate XXI. figs. 1, 9).
5. Upon the vessels (Plate XXT. fig. 1, #, t, 3).
c. Tn the connective tissue of the tongue generally, and also in the simple papille
(Plate XXI. fig. 1, , e).
