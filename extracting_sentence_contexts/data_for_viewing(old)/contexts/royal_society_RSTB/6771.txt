and therefore will not be discussed here.

In view of previous experimental work on the embryonic skeleton (Murray 1926;
Fell and Robison 1929; Murray and Selby 1930; Warren 1934; Hamburger 1938)
which has shown that the general form of bone rudiments is determined at a very early
stage, the posterior lateral processes might be expected to appear in the isolated
sternum during cultivation in vitro.

It is more surprising, however, that the curvature of the corpus sterni and the
ventral bending of the keel should appear not only in the explants of the complete
sternum but also in cultures of a single sternal plate. From a study of normal embryonic
development it might have been thought that the curvature of the corpus sterni was
caused by the pressure of the growing viscera. This is disproved by the fact that it
appears in vitro in the complete absence of the viscera, and regardless of whether the
sternum is explanted with the dorsal or with the ventral surface uppermost.


DEVELOPMENTAL MECHANICS OF THE AVIAN STERNUM 451

On morphological evidence alone, it seemed likely that the formation of the keel
was related to the growth and development of the pectoral muscles with which it is
so intimately associated, and, as indicated in Part I, the writer herself at first inclined
to this opinion. Experiment showed, however, that the keel can develop in the
absence of these muscles, but this result did not preclude the possible influence of other
extrinsic mechanical factors. Thus, as suggested in Part I, the continued expansion of
