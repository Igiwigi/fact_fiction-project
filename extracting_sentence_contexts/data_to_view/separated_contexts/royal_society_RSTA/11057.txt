The spring, as shown in the
drawings (Plate 13), consists of a pair of elliptical springs crossing each other at right
angles, the point of support for the thread being at the centre of the crossing. The
point to which the thread is attached is very light and might be lighter with advantage,
so as to increase the effect of the damping. There are four bars of spring steel (watch main-spring, in fact), which are attached
to the plate carrying the coach springs so as to stand up perpendicular to the plate. The free ends of these springs are attached by wire links to the thread support. The
object of this disposition is to damp down the free transverse vibrations of the
support.
