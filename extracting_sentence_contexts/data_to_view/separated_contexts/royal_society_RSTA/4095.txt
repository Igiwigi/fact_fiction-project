Evidently, the fidelity computed using an initial state pg and the fidelity
obtained from the Haar measure for the quantum maps share the same decay behaviour: a short-
time decay which depends on the characteristics and strength of the perturbation, followed by a
Lyapunov regime depending on a classical feature. We also compute | f2(t)| using the semi-classical DR. This is a simple task due to the fact that
unperturbed trajectories are geometrically obtained in the billiard and the perturbation only gives
a phase as dictated by equation (2.1). To take into account the initial pg(n1) state, we compute the
semi-classical | fa(t)| by assuming that the initial conditions are uniformly random inside the
billiard; the same was assumed for the direction of the initial momentum. The modulus squared
of the momenta are distributed as the eigenenergies of the unperturbed system.
