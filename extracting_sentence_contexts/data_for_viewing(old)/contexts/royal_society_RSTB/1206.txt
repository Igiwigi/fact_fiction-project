8 While the spinal nerve centres have been investigated in numerous ways since

unptt estimated the delay in the passage of an impulse through them, it is
temarkable how little is known with certainty of their functional activity.

By the galvanometric method we have been able to establish some fundamental
considerations on this matter, and, to indicate their bearing, we will first enumerate
categorically the facts that have been previously ascertained by various investigators.

The facts may be conveniently divided under the headings of—

* See particularly C. Gone, ‘ Anatomischer Anzeiger,’ 1890, Nos. 13 and 14, and C. Suerrineron,
‘Journal of Physiology,’ &c.

+ Wonor, ‘Untersuchungen zur Mechanik der Nerven und Nervencentren,’ 1876.
