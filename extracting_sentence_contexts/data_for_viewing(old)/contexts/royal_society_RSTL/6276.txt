arresting the formation of the former. 'To the same cause we have sncceeded in
referring an apparently anomalous state of oxygen, produced by passing a stream of
strong electrical sparks, for ome minutes, through that gas containing a trace of nitrogen.
The oxygen becomes by this treatment incapable of contracting or of changing into
ozone under the action of the silent discharge, and only recovers its usual condition by
exposure to heat or by standing for some hours. If the nitrogen amounts to not more
than 345th of the entire volume, this condition cannot be produced more than two or
three times. At first we supposed it to be a new (passive) state of oxygen, but we have
now no hesitation in referring it to the presence of a trace of hyponitric acid gas pro-
duced by the electrical sparks.

It is perhaps premature to attempt a positive explanation of the facts now described
regarding 0zone. 'I'he foregoing investigation into its volumetric relations has, for the
moment, rather increased than diminished the difficulty of determining the true nature

of that body. To reconcile the experimental results with the view that ozone is oxygen

series of experiments (Ig 3 and 4), from fifty to sixty times that of oxygen, and accord-
