In 2017, in an effort to make the YSM more realistic, Boghosian & co-workers [14] added two
features to it. The first of these was a simple model of redistribution that alone was sufficient
to suppress the tendency toward oligarchy. The second was a model of so-called Wealth-Attained
Advantage (WAA), which accounts for the fact that wealthier agents enjoy economic advantages
over poorer agents. The resulting two-parameter model, called the Extended Yard-Sale Model
(EYSM), was subsequently shown capable of describing empirical wealth distributions to an
accuracy of 2-3%. Most of the remaining discrepancy was due to the presence of negative-wealth
agents in empirical distributions who were not accounted for in the EYSM.
