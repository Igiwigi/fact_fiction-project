In general, the initial forces on the fault cannot be determined in the earth [25], and we will
use a UQ workflow to try and estimate these quantities. A snapshot of the ground shaking from
one of the simulations is shown in figure 1â€”the bumpy line is the rough fault surface, and the
colour scale shows the propagation of elastic waves away from the fault due to the slip on the
fault. Complicating matters is the fact that earthquake faults are not smooth planes, but instead
rough bumpy surfaces with a fractal geometry [26]. An important consequence of this is that
the smallest wavelength bumps have the largest effect on the resulting forces [27]. This is what
makes earthquake problems challenging to model: at a given model resolution, the simulation
is omitting details that play an important role.
