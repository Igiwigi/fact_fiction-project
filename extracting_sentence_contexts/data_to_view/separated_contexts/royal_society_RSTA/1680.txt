Uniqueness of ¢ is clear since C,(X) separates the points of X. a

Remark 3.3. In view of the arguments used in the proof of Lemma 3.2 and the classical
Gelfand—Naimark and Kakutani theorems (e.g. [4, Section 1.4] and [5, Section II.7]) representing
every unital commutative C*-algebra or AM-space as the space of continuous functions on
its (then compact) spectrum, the question arises as to whether one can also give an abstract
characterization of the spaces C,(X) for completely regular X. In fact, there is such a result due
to Cooper showing that these are (up to some technicalities) the prototypes of the so-called unital
commutative Saks-C*-algebras, i.e. unital commutative C*-algebras with a suitable additional
locally convex topology, see [28, Proposition II.2.6 and Appendix A.2] for a precise category
theoretic equivalence. Loosely speaking, this result shows that no essential information is lost
when passing to the Koopman linearization. In the case of semiflows on compact spaces, additional algebraic and lattice theoretic
characterizations of Koopman semigroups are available in terms of their generators.
