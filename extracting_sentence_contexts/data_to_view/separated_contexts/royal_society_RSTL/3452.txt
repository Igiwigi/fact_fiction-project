FARADAY'S EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY. (SERIES XVII.)

bable or philosophic cause assigned for the assumed action ; or reason given why
one or other of the consequent effects aboye mentioned should not take place: and,
as I have again and again said, I do not know of a single fact, or case of contact
current, on which, in the absence of such probable cause, the theory can rest.

2071. The contact theory assumes, in fact, that a force which is able to overcome
powerful resistance, as for instance that of the conductors, good or bad, through
which the current passes, and that again of the electrolytic action where bodies are
decomposed by it, can arise out of nothing. That, without any change in the acting
matter or the consumption of any generating force, a current can be produced which
hall go on for ever against a constant resistance, or only be stopped, as in the yoltaic
trough, by the ruins which its exertion has heaped up in its own course. This would
indeed be @ creation of power, and is like no other force in nature.
