and Gothenburg, and at the sea-side in the contiguous Skiir. I saw some considerable
boulders overlying the deposits of recent shells at Capellbacken near Uddeyalla, a
phenomenon analogous to that described near Upsala, where these huge erratic blocks
repose upon the sand-hills, characterized by fossil shells of Baltic species. The trans-
portation, therefore, of these rocky fragments into their present position continued
after the period when the modern shelly formations of both coasts were accumulated ;
and it may be inferred from seyeral facts mentioned in this memoir, that the drifting
of such blocks may now be going on by means of ice eyery year. I am at a loss to
conceive from what data some geologists have inferred the siniultaneous dispersion
of the erratic blocks of the North of Europe ; but it would carry me into too wide a
digression should I endeavour to controvert that theory. I can, however, confirm the
statement of Professor Havusmanx, that, in the ridges of sand and gravel, the largest
blocks occur in the highest parts of each ridge; a fact which seems to me to point
to the mode in which they may have been drifted into their present position. For if
these ridges were originally sand-banks in the sea, as the marine $hells found in
some of them incline me to believe, the summits of such banks would have arrested
the progress of ice-islands which might transport fragments of rock in the manner
before suggested.

In regard to the proposition, that the land in certain parts of Sweden is gradually
rising, I have no hesitation in assenting to it after my visit to the districts above al-
laded to. Independently of the geological proofs derived from strata containing recent
Shells, the evidence in favour of an upward movement consists of two kinds: first, the
testimony of the inhabitants; and secondly,the altered leyel indicated byartificial marks
cut in the rocks. More than one generation has passed away Since Cgrs1vs recorded
