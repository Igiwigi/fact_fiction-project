SIGILLARIA SCUTELLATA AND OTHER EUSIGILLARIAN STEMS, ETC. 157

it, as well as below, in the region of the phelloderm. Thus the parichnos of Sigillaria
differs markedly from any hitherto described among Paleozoic Lycopods,* and still more
from the so-called parichnos of living Lycopods, Our specimens, further, do not support
Mr. T. G. Hitx’st recent conclusion that this organ, when mature, had the form of an
empty canal.{ In many of our sections the parichnos tissue is fairly well preserved,
and where it is absent in others the fact may be accounted for by the delicate nature
of the walls of the elements.

Perhaps the most interesting point brought to light by the present study is the
fact that the xylem of the leaf-trace, when passing through the leaf-base, divides
into two distinct strands. In the secondary cortical tissue, which is regarded here as
being of the nature of phelloderm, the two xylem groups unite, and continue as
a single strand during their passage through the wood. The form of the leaf-trace
in the more external tissues of the stem has enabled us to identify the detached
leaves, named by Scorr, Sigillariopsis suleata, as being the leaves of a Sigillarian stem
closely allied to S, seutellata, perhaps even identical with that species. Thus, while
no petrifaction is as yet known in which the leaves can be seen actually in continuity
with a Sigillarian stem, there is now clear evidence which enables us to recognise
