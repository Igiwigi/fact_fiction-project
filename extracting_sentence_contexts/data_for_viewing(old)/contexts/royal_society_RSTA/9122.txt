quiet day, X, 25 (September 24, 1920), is paralleled within nine days by a real Q day,

XI, 7 (October 3). It will be seen that several of the supernumerary quiet days had
characters 0-1, one had even 0-0. The fact is that the size of the character figure was
not in all cases the only criterion taken into account at De Bilt in the selection of Q days.
For instance, XXIV, 1 (September 13, 1921), with character 0-1, isa Q day, while XXIV,
14 (September 26), with character 0-0, is not. But September 24 and 25 also had
character 0-0, and to have had three successive days, coming near the end of the month,
all Q days would have led to a rather unbalanced choice. For the purpose now in view,
September 26 is equally significant with September 24 and 25. Take again X,5
(September 4, 1920). September 4 has the same character, 1-4, as September 9. It
may be regarded as pure accident that September 9 was selected a D day, in preference
