Corollary 6.5. The map ©® is well defined and is a fibrewise real-analytic diffeomorphism satisfying
&*(2)=2


Proof. The fact that ® is well defined (i.e. does not depend on the choice of (t,t2) € R? with El
the property o""2)(y) € N) follows from lemma 6.4. To show that @ is a symplectomorphism, i.e.
*(2) = 2, we note that the position of each point y € T? x B is defined by the values of H, F “3
(which can be understood as coordinates on B) and fy, t2 (which can be understood as coordinates :
on the torus T? with the ‘origin’ (0,0) located on N). These four functions define a canonical
coordinate system, i.e.

2Q=dH A dt +dF A dt.
