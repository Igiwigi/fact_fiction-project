In the case of rough walls, the viscous drag is observed to
vanish slowly, just as for smooth walls, so that the asymptotic drag f,(k/H) is due entirely to the
form drag on the roughness elements in the limit [30]. The non-vanishing drag with rough walls
thus has the same origin as the non-vanishing drag for flow past finite solid bodies and analogous
flow phenomena are observed near the roughness elements, such as separating boundary layers
and pressure asymmetry [30,42,43]. As recently shown [44] (also [45]), the associated form drag
must in fact be due to a flux of spanwise vorticity across the streamwise flow. Although the
viscous drag becomes negligible in the limit, it is again observed to vanish more slowly than
1/Re so that the wall-normal derivatives du/dn must diverge as Re > oo. These divergences of velocity-gradients at the wall, as well as the additional divergences in the
interior, can be described as an ‘ultraviolet catastrophe’.
