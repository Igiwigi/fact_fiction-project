nd conclusions of BovssINGauLT, and others, in connexion with this question, from the
date above mentioned up to the present time, we shall have to refer pretty fully further
on. It may here be mentioned, however, that already at that early period Bovs-
8INGAULT had 80 far adyanced in his inquiries into the chemical statistics of certain agri-
cultural practices on the large scale, as to be apparently led by them to see the import-
ance of inyestigating much more closely the sources of the Nitrogen periodically yielded
by a given area of land, over and aboye that which was artificially supplied to it.
We fully admit the pertinence of the considerations, and the sagacity of the observa-
tions adduced on this head, more than twenty years ago, by Bouss1x6AULT. It will,
neyertheless, be well to preface the discussion of our own experimental evidence regard-
Sing the sources of the nitrogen of plants, by the statement of a few prominent and
Striking facts, established by investigations conducted here, at Rothamsted, illustrative
Sf the amounts of nitrogen yielded by different crops over a given area of land, and of
e relation of these amounts to certain measured, or known, sources of it. Of these
Points, however, we profess to speak only in a yery brief and summary manner on the
Zpresent occasion. The discussion in detail, of the evidence relating to them, would
Indeed itself exhaust the limits of our Paper. Moreover, we have already treated of
his snbject in a separate form, elsewhere®*; and it is our intention to consider it much
:Jnore fully at some future opportunity.
