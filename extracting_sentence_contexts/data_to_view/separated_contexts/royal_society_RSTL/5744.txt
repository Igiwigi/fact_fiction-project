CONDUCTIBILITY OF MERCURY AND AMALGAMS. 835

It will no doubt be remembered that we also experimented upon bars which, instead of
being compoxsed of cubes, were made of two longitudinal bars of copper, juxtaposed and
soldered to two other longitudinal bars of either tin, zinc, or lead, and that all these
bars conducted heat as if they had been entirely composed of pure copper, and had
not, contained half their bulk of tin, zinc, or lead. We have made, since those results
were published, a great number of experiments with the hope of throwing some light
on the above interesting fact, but we regret to say without success. We have, however.
noticed a result which deserves to be recorded; it is, that a bar composed of 2 of
bismuth and 2 of antimony, juxtaposed and s0ldered together, is the only one which
conducts heat in the same ratio as indicated by theory ; for example,—

We have also ascertained that the fine film of solder existing between the blades
exerts no influence whatever on the proportion of heat conducted by the compound
bars, for we have—
