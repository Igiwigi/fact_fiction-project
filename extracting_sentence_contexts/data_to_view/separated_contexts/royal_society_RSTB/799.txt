In other words, the useful work done at each contraction of the
ventricles is increased without a corresponding increase in the catabolism of the
ventricular muscle. As we have noted in Section III., the contractions of the ven-
tricles would seem to gain in efficiency with increase, within certain limits, of their
circumference, independently of the increased economy of the energy evolved at each
contraction which we have just referred to. It must, of course, be @ priori assumed
that the increased height of the pulse-waves which results from vagus slowing is
not beneficial to the circulation, In all of these particulars the heart is relieved of
work by the action of the vagus, the circulation of course suffering to a certain extent,
The mere fact that the centripetal fibres which call the vagus into play by reflex
action come chiefly from the heart itself, shows that one part, and a very important

part, of the vagus function is to reduce the work done by the heart in the interest of
the heart itself. We conclude, then that the vagus acts as a protecting nerve to the heart, reducing
the work thrown upon that organ when, from fatigue or other causes, such relief is
required by it. The fact, however, that there exist centripetal fibres which call the
vagus centre into activity, in such nerves as the sciatic and splanchnic, shows that
the vagus mechanism may be called upon to act in the interests of other parts of the
