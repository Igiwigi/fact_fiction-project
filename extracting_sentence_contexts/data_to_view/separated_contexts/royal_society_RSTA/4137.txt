The fewer
the ions also the less rapid is the rate at which they recombine ; we would, therefore,
expect the average life of the very few nuclei with which we are now concerned, if
they really are ions, to be at least as long as 1 second in the absence of any electric
field. If then we have here simply a case of spontaneous ionisation due to molecular
encounters, we ought to obtain something like 800 times as many drops without the
field as with it. In similar experiments t made with the ions produced by Réntgen
or uranium rays, much weaker fields were in fact found sufficient to prevent almost
completely the production of fogs by expansion. In the experiments now made without external ionising agents, not the slightest
difference could be detected between the appearance of the showers on the two sides
of the apparatus. All degrees of expansion from ¢,/v, = 1°25 to v,/v, = 1°38 were
tried.
