Assuming no other spatial aspects and a constant flux of particles, p(x, y;t) = p(x,y;0) is time
independent and denoted as p(x, y). Now each Dy(t) (with i=, II, II) will evolve independently.
Indeed, if we insert this ansatz into the equation of motion,

dD. a ~ nm a
in—F =[Hr,D] =[Ha,D] + V@)Hsa,P], (4.4)
we reach for the right-hand side,

RIR RIR
+ I. dx le dyo(x,y)Ix) yl{{Ha, Pin — KHsa Bun} + he, (4.6)

where in the last term we took account of the fact that in its integration intervals V(x) = —k and
V(y) =0. This immediately leads to an uncoupled equation of motion for each D;(t),

and ih gp = Ha, Bunl — KHsa Pun.

The first equation of motion accounts for the spin located in the region R. Comparing it with
(2.11), we see that we have exactly the same situation except for the factor —k, which comes from
