F. W. MOTT ON HEMISECTION OF

CiaupE Brernarp* and Ostroumorr,t by experiments on animals, showed the exist-
ence of vaso-motor fibres in these roots, and GAsKELL{ showed that these fine fibres
existed in the anterior roots of the thoracic region in the Dog, and to him is due the
merit of the association and correct interpretation of these two facts. Rose Braprorp and BayuissÂ§ following up the work of CLaupE Bernarp and
Ostroumorr, have shown that stimulation of certain of these roots leads to vaso-
constriction of the vessels of the limbs, and a general rise of blood-pressure. They
have proved that the vaso-motor nerves to the hind limb of the Dog pass out by the
11th, 12th, 18th dorsal, and 1st lumbar roots.
