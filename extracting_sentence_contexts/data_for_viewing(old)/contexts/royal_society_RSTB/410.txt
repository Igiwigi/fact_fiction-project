MOTOR CORTEX AND INTERNAL CAPSULE IN AN ORANG-OUTANG, 151

in the psychical order of events, zc. (1), direction of the head towards the danger ; (2)
initial movement of flight.

In the Orang the case is otherwise. The vertical posture requires much purposive
action. An Orang placed under the same circumstances as the Bonnet rises on to its
hind limbs by extension of the hip ; we, therefore, find that this movement is repre-
sented in this animal to great excess compared to that of flexion.

Further, in accordance with the now well recognised fact that as the foci of function
are more spread over the convex surface of the hemisphere from the longitudinal
towards the Sylvian fissure, so they are more highly, 7.e., purposively evolved, it is
clear that in the Orang the hip possesses a far higher character of representation than
it has in the Bonnet, and we believe that this subserves the vertical posture. In
addition, just as in the Bonnet the anatomical juxtaposition of the foci corresponds
with the psychical order of events, in the Orang it is seen also that the focus of direc-
tion of the head towards the source of danger is situated below the focus for the hipâ€”
below because, as will be seen, what in the upper part of the hemisphere is horizontally
directed in the Bonnet Monkey becomes vertically arranged in the Orang.
