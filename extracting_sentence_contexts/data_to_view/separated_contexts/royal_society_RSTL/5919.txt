This is the construction of the sextactic points obtained by PLUCKER and
STEINER. 40. Reverting to the equation of the line joining the point of contact of the five-
pointic conic with the point of simple intersection, this meets the cubic in a third point,
and Mr. SALMON has shown that this third point is in fact the second tangential (tan-
gential of the tangential) of the point of contact, or, what is the same thingâ€”


CONTAOT AT ANY POINT OF A PLANE CURVE. 391
