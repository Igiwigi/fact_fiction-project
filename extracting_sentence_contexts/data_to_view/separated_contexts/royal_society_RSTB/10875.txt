In fact, by 20 January
2015, there were fewer than 20000 confirmed and suspected
cases in Liberia and Sierra Leone [92]. Importantly, the forecast
assumed that no changes in individual behaviours and
community health decisions would take place. Hewlett &
Amola [93] present evidence that Ebola-affected communi-
ties, in fact, typically adopt protective measures that change
the outcome of epidemics. This disconnect between the epi-
demic modelling and the reality of how humans and their
institutions react to a changing infectious disease epidemic
illustrates the importance of incorporating behavioural
research into epidemic forecasting efforts. As individuals and communities assess and reassess how
their behaviours affect their risk of exposure to a disease, beha-
viours are subject to modification.
