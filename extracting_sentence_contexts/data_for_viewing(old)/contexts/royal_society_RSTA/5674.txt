t
enjoy weak stability (since the embedding H* — L? is compact, cf. §3b), but can also be produced

using ‘convex integration’ methods, a phenomenon which to our knowledge has not been
observed before in any other situation.


While the classical justification for the exponent 3 in theorem 3.5 given in the physics literature
is based essentially on dimension analysis and, crucially, the law of finite energy dissipation,
the proof of theorem 3.5 suggests an entirely different heuristics, which does not rely on energy
considerations.

The main mechanism to produce non-conservative solutions is in fact an algorithm which we
will present in the form of an iteration scheme. Assuming that we start with a sufficiently smooth!
(vo, Po, Ro) = (u,p, R) as in (3.3), at each step of the iteration we add an oscillatory correction
in order to decrease the defect to being a solution. More precisely, we construct inductively a
sequence of smooth solutions (vq, Pq,Rq),q=1,2,... to

d¢vg + div (vq @ vq) + Vpq = div “| (3.16)

and div vy =0,

such that vg > v and Ry — 0 uniformly.
We write vg41 = Ug + Wg41 where we think of Ug as the ‘mean flow’ on length-scales > dg land
Wg+1 as a ‘fluctuation’ on this scale. Up to lower-order corrections w,+1 should have the form
