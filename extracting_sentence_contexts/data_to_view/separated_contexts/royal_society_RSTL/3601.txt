At 3B, fig. 154, the cell-membrane is formed. We thus seem to have
even here a mode of origin of the membrane of the cell, essentially the same as that
which, in a former paper, I showed to form the chorion{,—as will be hereafter
pointed out in the membrane of the ovisac,—and as seems to be the mode of produc-
tion of other, and perhaps all, membranes, as well as fibrous tissues.

174. Other facts observable in an examination of the pale cells of the lens, are
equally confirmatory of my views regarding © cells” in general. The nucleus is very
distinctly seen to be composed of discs (figs. 154, 155, 156.), into which it divides ;
and at a certain part, there is s0metimes seen a highly refracting object, correspond-
ing apparently to the nucleolus of authors, but, as I believe, being really an orifice
communicating with the exterior of the cell. 175.
