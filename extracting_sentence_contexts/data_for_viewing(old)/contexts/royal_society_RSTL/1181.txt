derstand them ; but he seems to have had some vague notion that electrical combina-
tions, when not exhibiting theirelectrical tension, were in a magnetic state, and that
there was a; kind of electro-magnetic meridian depending upon the electricity of the
earth, See Annales de Chimie, T. 64, p. 80. Since this letter has been written, Dr.
Marcer has been 50 good asto send me from Genoa, some pages of ALpiny on Gal-
vanism,and of Izaxn's Manual of Galvanism, published at Paris more than sixteen
years ago. M. Moon, senior, of (Genoa, is quoted in these pages as having rendered
a steel needle magnetic, by placing it in a voltaic circuit for a great length of time.
This, however, seems to. have been dependent merely upon its place in the magnetic
meridian, or upon an accidental curyature of it; but M. Rouacnzs, of Trente, is
sfated to have discovered that the pile of Volta caused a declination of the needle; the
details are not given, but if the general statement be correct, the author could not
haye observed the same fact as M. OxrsTeD, but merely supposed that the needle
had its magnetic poles altered after being placed in the voltaic circuit as a part of the
electrical combination.

obscure, or their experiments inaccurate, they were neglected:
the chemical and electrical phenomena exhibited by the won-
derful combination of Volta, at that time almost entirely
absorbed the attention of scientific men ; and the discovery
of the fact of the true connection between electricity and
magnetism, seems to have been reserved for M. OxrsrTeD,
