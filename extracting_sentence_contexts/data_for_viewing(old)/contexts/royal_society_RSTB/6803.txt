disease affecting leaves at the junction of the upper and middle thirds and then
proceeds in both directions and, in the group of varieties we are considering, never
kills the plant. The progress of the disease downwards is more rapid and the lesions on
the leaves more extensive than those on leaves nearer the apex.

The second season symptoms of this group may be illustrated by the behaviour of
Majestic. Infected tubers may give rise either to quite healthy plants, fully infected
ones, or fail to sprout. A similar behaviour was observed by the writer (Salaman 1930)
in infections with the two streaks A and B, and has since been recognized as occurring
in tubers of Epicure when infected with the X virus. Bawden (1936) has described this
phenomenon in some detail. If the shoots are infected they are completely so, and
show no amelioration of symptoms such as has been described by Botjes (1934). This
doubtless is due to the fact that the original infection is the result of a single virus and
not a complex. From a single tuber it is not uncommon to find one shoot healthy, and
a second from another eye diseased.

Infected plants are invariably stunted in their growth; the leaves, as soon as they
unfold, display innumerable necrotic foci which appear under the upper epidermis
and at first do not penetrate throughout the thickness of the lamella. As the plant
grows, similar lesions appear on the new leaves, whilst in the older ones the necroses
fuse, bringing about a collapse of the leaf (fig. 15, Plate 20), streaks appear in the petiole
and stem, and the collapsed leaves begin to hang and then drop. Before long all the
lower part of the plant is stripped bare, the young leaves are mottled, spotted with
necrotic spots, and may be considerably deformed by contractions which occur in the
yellow interveinal areas.
