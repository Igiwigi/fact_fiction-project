of olfactory cues by males in Djungarian hamsters (Phodopus
campbelli) [125], ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta) [126] and
cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) [127]; the use of
female vocal signals in grey mouse lemurs (Microcebus
murinus) [128] and Barbary macaques [129]; and detection
of female behavioural changes in rhesus macaques [130]
and long-tailed macaques (Macaca fasciularis) [131]. Repro-
ductive skew may then be increased, insofar as high-
ranking males are better able to act on this information
than low-ranking males. Chimpanzees in captivity use olfac-
tory cues to obtain information about social relationships
[132], suggesting they may be able to use them to detect ovu-
lation [133], but whether either species of Pan does, in fact, do
so remains untested.

(b) Mechanisms operating under limited-control (iv) Importance of female alliance

(i) Social cohesion and female gregariousness In some species, females may cooperate with kin to combat
Although variation in social cohesion occurs across chimpanzee male aggression and harassment (rhesus macaques:

bos generally appear to travel in larger [106-111] and more females; this strategy may have evolved to counter sexual
cohesive parties [104,112] than chimpanzees, with females coercion and/or infanticide by males [52,138,139]. One of
