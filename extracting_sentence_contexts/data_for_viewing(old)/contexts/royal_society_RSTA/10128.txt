which the jet issues is practically constant.

Lastly, the jet is emitted parallel to the wall of the building, instead of perpendicular
to it as before. This tends to increased uniformity in the conditions, as the potential
varies rapidly in the direction perpendicular to the building, but little, if at all,
in a horizontal direction taken parallel to it. The discharge tube, which projects
from a window in the west wall, is situated about 10 feet to the north of the old tube,
but nearly at the same level above the ground.

A flower border used to run the whole length of the west wall, containing shrubs
3 or 4 feet high. The northern half of this border was cleared of shrubs and laid
down in grass, which has been kept short the whole year round. These changes were
made with the object of securing that no appreciable fictitious element should be
introduced into the annual change of potential gradient.

A definite test of the insulation of the apparatus was introduced, and is applied
each morning. It is not always possible to improve defective insulation immediately
when discovered, but at the worst the test shows when a day’s record is to be
regarded with suspicion.

The surface of the ground outside the building is not absolutely level, so the height
of the spot where the jet breaks into drops can hardly be given with mathematical
precision, It is very approximately 11 feet (3°35 metres). The perpendicular distance
from the general outline of the west wall is 50% inches (1273 centims.).
