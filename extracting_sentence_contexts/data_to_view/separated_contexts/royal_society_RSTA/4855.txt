In fact, this is an identity. Note that (2.1) is the limiting case when a, 6 > 0 of
this identity. When we pass to higher moments, the corresponding identities will be consequences of
conjectures rather than facts. Thus, it is desirable to give a direct proof of this now, one that can
be imitated later. Proof.
