oscillators.

Synchronization phenomena represent nowadays a huge research field, and the
next contribution by Rubido et al. (2009) also focuses on synchrony, in this
case arising in a set of light-controlled oscillators (LCOs). An LCO is a realistic
pulse oscillator whose behaviour resembles the integrate-and-fire oscillator, but

differs by the fact that its discharge is not instantaneous. The authors study
experimentally and numerically a system composed of coupled LCOs in different
configurations, including local coupling. Synchronization times are quantified
as a function of the initial conditions and the coupling strength. For each
configuration, the number of stable states is determined by varying the different
parameters that characterize each oscillator.

The next two contributions show that information theory provides novel
effective tools to investigate important multi-disciplinary problems such as the
characterization of pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs) via complexity
and randomness quantifiers and the characterization of high-order correlations in
the information transmitted by neuronal systems via Shannon information theory.
