an eye, whether living or dead, in the downward or negative direction causes
counter-current in the opposite (upward) direction, and there is in this reaction no
absolute token by which to distinguish between polarisation and physiological
response. But whereas an induction current through a dead eye in the upward
direction causes a downward counter-current, it causes an upward after-current in
the same (upward or positive) direction in a normal living eye. In this case there
is after-effect in the positive direction, 7.e., a retinal discharge in the same direction
as the exciting current.

With a normal fresh eyeball giving the regular positive response to illumination
this retinal discharge is in the positive or upward direction, whether the exciting
current be directed upwards or downwards. This is the principal and most certainly
demonstrable fact. At later stages and with moribund eye-balls the effects become
variable. We-may then witness retinal discharge upward in response to upward
excitation, and downward in response to downward excitation, and finally I have
once or twice obtained a downward retinal discharge in response to both
directions of excitation. . But I have bestowed little attention as yet upon these
varieties, and I do not associate them with the three types of response to light.


EXCITED BY LIGHT AND EXCITED ELECTRICALLY. 155

They are in any case less striking and invariable than the normal positive response
which I have described as the principal effect, and which is of such regularity,
magnitude, and duration as to suggest comparison with the discharge of an electrical
