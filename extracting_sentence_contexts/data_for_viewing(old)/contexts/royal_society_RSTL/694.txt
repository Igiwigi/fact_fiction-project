pliched. Amidst the total absence of all attempts of this
kind, the following illustrations of one of the most obvious
assistants of the inventive faculty, will not, I hope, be consi-
dered useless, even though it should have no other effect than
that of directing the attention of those who are engaged in
mathematical enquiries, to: this most interesting and-impor-
tant subject.

At our first | entrance into” algebra, one' of the- most
remarkable circumstances which presents- itself is, that
some fractions which in certain cases apparently  vanish,

have in fact a finite value. Such is the fraction = which
when z=0 becomes _ = =, and yet its real value is well

known to be log. +.

Here then by assigning a certain value to a variable quan-
tity which is capable of all degrees of magnitude, the expres-
sion apparently becomes illusory: let us now examine a
parallel case in the Calculus of Functions. Take the expres-

r—=4= |
sion —— and let us suppose v to be an arbitrary charac-
