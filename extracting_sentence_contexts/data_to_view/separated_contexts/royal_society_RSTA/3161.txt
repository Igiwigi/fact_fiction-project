metal there is a hard and a soft state, with different physical properties. If in the
future a still closer agreement between the results obtained by different observers is
demanded, it will be necessary to specify both chemical composition and microscopic
structure of the materials tested. The fact that the thermal conductivities of most of the pure metals decrease with
increase of temperature, while those of all the alloys tested increase with increase of
temperature, raises the question whether the increase with temperature observed in
the case of aluminium both in JAcER and Dirssenmorst’s experiments and in the
present ones, and in that of nickel in the present experiment, cannot be attributed to
small amounts (less than 1 per cent.) of impurity remaining in the specimens tested. While there is much to be said in favour of this in the two cases mentioned, it
seems to me that the apparent existence of a maximum of conductivity of silver, and
possibly of steel, and a minimum conductivity of aluminium, shows that we must
guard ourselves against stating that the thermal conductivities of all pure metals
decrease as the temperature rises, and limit ourselves to the less general statement
that the thermal conductivities of most pure metals decrease with rise of temperature
over the range —170° C. to +100° C., while those of all the alloys tested increase
over the same range of temperature. On comparing these results with those obtained previously for non-metallic sub-
stances,* mostly electrical insulators, it will be seen that on the whole metals and
non-metals are affected in the same way by change of temperature, 7.e., both tend to
conduct heat better at low than at high temperatures, while alloys conduct better at
high than at low temperatures, and in this respect resemble glass, the only mixture
of non-conductors of electricity which has up to the present been investigated.
