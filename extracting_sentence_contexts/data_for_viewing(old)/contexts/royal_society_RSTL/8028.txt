> By means of these proportions it is possible to approximate to the amounts of the
Sending-moments and shearing-forces in other ships of the type when their displace-
Anents and lengths are known ; only it is necessary to remember that in many cases the
Sesults obtained must be regarded as strictly limiting values, on account of the fact that
n the * Minotaur the excesses of weight at the extremities for still water and the fine-
—ess of form are both extremely great.
YZ Passing on to the second typical ship, the * Victoria and Albert,” we will suppose her
be balanced on the crest of a wave of her own length (300 feet) and 20 feet high
from hollow to crest. This height has been taken because it bears nearly the same pro-
Portion to the length as that of the 400-feet wave on which we supposed the © Mino-
taur* to be balanced, and fairness of comparison between the conditions of strain in the
two types is thus ensured. Under these circumstances careful calculations, of which
the results are recorded in Plate XIX. fig, 22, Plate XX. fig. 23, and Plate XXI. fig. 24,
show that the additional immersion of the middle body does away altogether with the
excess of weight existing there in still water, while the decreased immersion of the ends
leads, of course, to an increase in their excesses of weight. In short, on the wave-crest
