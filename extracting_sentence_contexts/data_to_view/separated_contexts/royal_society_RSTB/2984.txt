They also dehisce by a
longitudinal cleft. On the narrower pinnules which have a single row of sporangia
on each side of thé midrib we have only to imagine the sporangia increased in length
till they extend past the margin of the pinnule and their apices bent downwards,
where, if the pinnule were stalked, we would now have a Crossotheca, for it is not
necessary that in Crossotheca the microsporangia be arranged in a circle. It is not, of
course, known whether the sporangia of Dactylotheca are unilocular or bilocular, but
still one can easily see how such a genus, which occurs in the Culm, could give rise to
a form like Crossotheca, 5

I am aware that Dactylotheca is classed with the “ferns” at present, but I have
little doubt its supposed sporangia are the microsporangia of a Pteridosperm,

The most remarkable character in Crussotheca is the bilocular microsporangia,
From the fact that the microsporangia are borne on modified pinnules of the ordinary
fern type, so long as stamens are held to be foliar in nature, any comparison with
them is inadmissible, Among recent plants it is difficult to find a parallel case and
though in the Marattiacee the sporangia may become abnormally bilocular through
septation,§ I do not think that in Crossotheca this is their mode of origin. In fact,
the sporangia forming the synangium of the Marattiacee arise in all cases,

according to Bower, from a process of septation, and though one cannot trace the
course of development of the microsporangia of Crossotheca, they arise as individual
organs, and at no period are the members of a sorus connected with each other as far
as I have been able to observe.
