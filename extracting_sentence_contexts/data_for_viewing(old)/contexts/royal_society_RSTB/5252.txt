the petioles is needed to reduce their irregular
disposition in the central part to the orderly
arrangement at the periphery of the trunk. All
that is necessary is a slight radially outward in-
clination of each petiole during its ascending course
through the matrix of roots. Sufficient lengths
of the “false stem ’’ are not available to allow
one to follow a rachis from the centre to the
periphery ; but knowing the extremely small angle
of inclination, we -can say that a petiole arising
from a stem near the centre of the trunk probably
did not reach the surface before a height of several
feet from the base was attained. This fact alone
gives some idea of the height which the entire leaf
may have reached.

Fortunately it is also possible to form a rough
minimum estimate of the height of the trunk. In
the large section figured in Plate 1 there are 13
stems, four of which show bifurcating steles. Con-
sidering that this specimen represents less than
one-third of the entire trunk, the number of stems
in the complete cross-section at this level must
have been well over 40. This would mean that the
original axis must have undergone at least six
