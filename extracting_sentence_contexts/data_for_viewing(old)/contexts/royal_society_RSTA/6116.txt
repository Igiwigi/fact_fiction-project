In this form, it can be easily checked that the kinetic part of the action is invariant under global
O(a, d) transformations preserving the shifted dilaton ¢, i.e. under the transformations

¢>¢ and M>M=2'MQ, (2.32)

where @ is a constant matrix satisfying 2™Q =n. Such an invariance is still valid for V 4 0 if the
dilaton potential is a constant, or is a function of the variable ¢ (or, more generally, it is a function
of some O(d, d) scalar formed with M and @). Also, the scalar-factor duality of the previous section
can be recovered as a particular case of O(d, d) transformation. In fact, let us consider a pure gravi-
dilaton background with B =0, and a global transformation generated by the particular matrix
n € O(d,d). We have

_({G o ~ OT a _({G 0

so that G> G=G", ie. the considered transformation simply produces an inversion of the
spatial part of the metric. For a diagonal isotropic metric, in particular, G = —a7I, and the above
equation is equivalent to the scale-factor duality transformation a> @=a’.

The invariance under global O(d,d) transformations can be preserved even including into
the action the source contributions, provided their energy-momentum/charge/current densities,
