well beyond the transition to tertiary creep) and taking the value n'’ = 4.4 [31], we derive for ice
at —10°C the values B =2.5 x 105 Mpa~3> s~! and C = 0.027 MPas!/". Equation (7.1) then gives
for the coefficient of dry kinetic friction at —10°C the relationship

ba = 0.98, (7.2)

for velocity in units of ms~1.

Equation (7.2) is shown as the dashed line on figure 8. Barring roughness, which remains to be
incorporated, the model captures the dry-sliding measurements quite well.

The fact that the kinetic friction of sea ice and freshwater ice is practically indistinguishable,
even though bulk sea ice creeps more rapidly, is again taken to mean that asperities and the
underlying deformation zone are too small to contain creep-enhancing pockets of brine.

(c) Dry—wet sliding: velocity weakening =

As already mentioned, fundamental to velocity weakening is frictional heating and the creation of a
meltwater. Yet, direct observations of water at the sliding interface are lacking. There is, however, DG
indirect evidence, deduced from Coulombic shear faults. When introduced into relatively warm aa
(at —10°C) specimens of both sea ice and freshwater ice through proportional, biaxial loading, [4
the faults did not come apart [47]. They had slid a few millimetres in about one second, i.e. at a :
velocity of approximately 10-3-10-? ms~! . This speed is within the weakening regime. Solid- a
state healing of the kind discussed in §5 could not have been at play, for the contact time was 18
