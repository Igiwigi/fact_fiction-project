large spherical or oval varicosities. Many of the delicate processes end without any
obvious end-swellings, whilst others form minute brush-like endings. It has not been
possible in my silver and methylene blue preparations to distinguish either a neuro-
fibrillar network in the cells or any connection between the interstitial cells and the nerve
fibres.

Much discussion has taken place concerning the nature of these cells since Casan
described them in 1889, and there are two contradictory views regarding them. Casa (9)
demonstrated the existence of a neurofibrillar network in these cells, and his observations
were later confirmed by those of his pupil La Vriua (37). This network was in silver
preparations frequently better impregnated than a similar network in the neurones of
Averpacn’s and Metssner’s plexuses. The existence of these fibrille, the varicose
form of the processes, and the fact that they stain deeply with methylene blue, claimed
to be specific for nerve cells, were held by Casan and La Vitxa to demonstrate their
nervous character. But it must be noted that neither Casau nor La Vinxa succeeded
in tracing a connection between them and the neurones and extrinsic fibres of the
enteric plexuses, although they state they were able to trace their processes to the
smooth muscle fibres and to the crypts of LreperKtauy, in relation to which they describe
them as terminating.

Tn 1895, P. Scuunrz (59) gave a description of these cells and definitely stated that
they are of a nervous nature, and in 1920 EH. Mitier (50), from his observations on
embryos of chick and Squalus acanthias,claimedthat the interstitial cells and the neurones
of Type II are derived from the sympathetic primordium, whilst the nerve cells of Type I
migrate along the vagus primordium. Mixumr believed that the interstitial cells become
