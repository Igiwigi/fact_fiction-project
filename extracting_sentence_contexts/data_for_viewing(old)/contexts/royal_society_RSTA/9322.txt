ares which are probably (331). In the region of the fourth layer-line nothing may be
discerned but a very weak (040).

Taken as a whole the photograph is what might be expected from an imperfectly
crystalline system in which the only sharply defined translation is that which is parallel
to the fibre axis; in other words, it suggests long filament-like molecules which cling
together sideways with varying degrees of perfection. The radial spreading of (100),
and possibly of (001) too, is very marked, and indicates either malformed junctions or

mixed-crystallisation effects. On the other hand, the fact that (100) is the spot most
free from dispersion points to an arrangement in which the dispersion is confined to a
real or imaginary cylinder, the radii of which are the normals to the planes (100). It is
exactly this distribution which has already been found for ramie fibre.*

The reflections described above may be referred to an orthogonal cell of dimensions,
a=274.U.,b = 10-:34.U.,c =9-8AU. Table I gives a list of the observed and
calculated spacings as derived from a study of the whole of the available material.
