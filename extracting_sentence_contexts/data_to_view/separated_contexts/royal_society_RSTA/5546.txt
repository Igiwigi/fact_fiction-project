We will make use of the plane wave expansion of the Dirac
mass

8(x) = x [- exp(ikx) dk, (3.2)

or more precisely, in its functionally generalized form [23]

stv = 5 | expli(y-#)1DIA) G3)
A symbolic expression of the Green’s function K[69(x)|0(x), t] was given as follows:
(xt) =0(x) ft an
K{G9(2)16(2),1=C exp {i[ ae | (G2 +nQte1) ax} Ding oD AL, a)
n(2e,0)=60(x) 0 ar

where Q[¢] = —¢¢x + véxx and C is a formal normalization constant. In those expressions e.g. D[¢] = My dé (x, f) denotes a fictitious (translation-invariant) measure.”

Actually the basic formula (3.3) is common to all the derivations we review in this article. We recall how Rosen’s path integral representation is derived. Because of linearity it suffices
to show that K satisfies the Hopf equation.
