& ventral panels of 31.836 contain cross-hatched triangles and lozenges. In 31.834
8 Igonamo, Barai, the broad fore band has semi-spiral bands of usually four lines; some
< of these are cross-hatched and some contain a zigzag.

S Longitudinal bands.

= In a considerable number of pipes the internodes are divided longitudinally by
g plain bands bounded by fine lines that extend along the whole length of the internodes.
& The intermediate patterned bands are divided by transverse spaces or bands, which
Â© usually are plain; thus a patterned band contains a longitudinal row of separate panels.
s The distinction between longitudinal and transverse bands is due to a different
5 conception in the lay-out of the decoration which usually is more clearly expressed in
A pipes from other areas. As a matter of fact this real distinction is not very obvious in
many pipes from the Rigo district, as in both groups the patterned bands in most
pipes are broken up into panels and the panels may be decorated in a similar manner.
In some, but not in all, pipes the bounding lines of the median dorsal plain band
diverge at the fore end to accommodate the dorsal hole. In some pipes the dorsal hole
bears no special relation to the decoration. In most pipes there are median dorsal,
median ventral and lateral plain bands, but in others this symmetry is not found. The
broad dorsal and ventral plain bands in a few pipes contain a narrow longitudinal
band with a long jagged zigzag or jagged chevrons,
Some pipes have oblique cross-hatched bars across the individual panels, and the
decoration is so arranged that four contiguous panels produce solid or hollow lozenges
with external concentric cross-hatched bars.
