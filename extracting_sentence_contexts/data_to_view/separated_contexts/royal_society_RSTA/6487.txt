In the presence of an :8
inhomogeneous dielectric profile, the Poisson equation reads . VegeL (VW) =—p2), (2.1)

where V =d/dz, €9 is the vacuum permittivity, y(z) is the electrostatic potential and p(z) is the
charge density due to ions. At an interface, the dielectric response function is in fact a tensor; for
laterally homogeneous charge distributions only the perpendicular component ¢ | (z) is relevant. Introducing the perpendicular electrostatic field E | (z) = —Vy(z) and the approximate relation

D1 (2) ~e0e1@E.@), (2.2)

which becomes virtually exact in the long-wavelength limit for constant vertical displacement
field D, (z), we can rewrite the Poisson equation as

coV2W(2) = ~€7!@)p(2) — Di@Veq"). (23)

According to the Boltzmann equation, the charge density is determined by the electrostatic
potential via

where j14(z) and _(z) are the non-electrostatic contributions to the chemical potential of positive
and negative ions, respectively. In the following, we set 24(z) = 4—(z) =0.
