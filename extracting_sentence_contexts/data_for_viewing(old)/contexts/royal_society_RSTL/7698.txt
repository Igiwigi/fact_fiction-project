maxilla; it divided into three branches, which were traceable into the muscles and inte-
guments of the nares.

As the blowholes are the only orifices through which the atmospheric air is allowed.
to pass during the act of respiration, we find accordingly that these outlets are amply
provided with the means of carrying on this important function. Their alz can be
divaricated by the simultaneous action of the superficial and deep muscular planes, and,
on the other hand, they could be brought together by the middle plane of fibres, which
from their fasiculi running in an elliptical direction on each side of the blowholes,
formed a regular sphincter and approximate the external lips of the orifices ; at the same
time the central portion of the muscle, from its deep-seated position, would press the ex-
ternal or alar cartilages against the septum, and 80 completely close these passages; the
Pressure of water from the outside may account for the fact that the muscles for opening
are much more powerful than those for closing these canals,

There are some points worthy of notice respecting the mechanism by which the func-
tions of respiration and deglutition are performed, in this and other Cetaceans, which we
think have not hitherto been clearly explained.

As regards the first or respiratory function, it is obvious that when the animal ap-
proaches the surface of the ocean its first act will necessarily be that of expiration, in
order to expel from its lungs the deoxidized air contained therein after the preceding
inspiratory act ; expiration is accomplished in a great measure, as in other mammals,
by the contraction of the abdominal muscles drawing in the ribs, and propelling upwards
