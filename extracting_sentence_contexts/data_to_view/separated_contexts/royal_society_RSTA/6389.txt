What
is the difference, he said, between measuring a single statue 10 times with poor instruments and
measuring 10 different people? In either case, we have a bell-shaped distribution with an average
and a quantifiable standard deviation, and the interpretations can be similar. Nature, he said,
shoots for the average man the way a marksman shoots for target—the variation that exists in our
heights, chest lengths, chest widths, and so on, simply result from the fact that nature’s gun has
too short a barrel [9]. These ideas, especially as popularized by the Englishman Henry Buckle’s History of Civilization,
rippled through the educated world and proved to be vital for the development of statistical
mechanics. Boltzmann and Maxwell both—apparently independently (in this paragraph I rely
on [8]: 111ff)}—used the analogy to individuals to explain their reasoning as they developed
the statistical mechanics of gases.
