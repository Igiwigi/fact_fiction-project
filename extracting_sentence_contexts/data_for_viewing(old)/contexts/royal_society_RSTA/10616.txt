The large zeros of P,’ (z) are approximately those of cosh a. Z, and the latter are
such that, with the usual notation, a, = n? + n + 4.

We notice that the general form of a, given above shows that the large zeros of
P,(z) separate and are separated by those of P,’(z), a fact which agrees with the
extension of Rotue’s theorem.

§ 94. From the preceding example it is now evident that we are in a position to
prove that, for all the types of integral functions of which asymptotic expansions
have been obtained in this memoir, the order of the function is equal to the order of
its derivative. And not only so, but we are theoretically in a position to determine
as nearly as we please a formula for the (large) n™ zero of the derivative. It would
be tedious to consider in turn all cases which can arise: we will take one or two as
typical of the rest.

As an immediate corollary of the preceding example it may be seen that the
