In fact the losses were greater in experiments 2 and 3 with
vessels 80 cm. (= 31째5 in.) deep, and only 11 cm, (= 4째3 in.) wide, than in No. 1
with a width of 17째5 em. (= 6째9 in.). It is indeed obvious that, with vessels so narrow and deep, and closed at the
bottom, as according to the description we conclude they were,* and with no plant to
cause evaporation, and with consequently very little atration, the conditions would be
favourable for the evolution of free nitrogen, and the more so in the narrower vessels. In fact it may be doubted whether, if there had been holes at the bottom of the

* We have since ascertained that the vessels were closed at the bottom.
