The fact of the evolution of Nitrogen in the decompoxsition of nitrogenous organic
matter, illustrated in Sub-section D, p. 497 et 8eq., indicated the danger of using Such
matter as a source of supply of Nitrogen. We have therefore used solutions of sul-
phate of ammonia (se Appendix, p. 542), by means of which we have been enabled t9
supply the plants with known quantities of combined Nitrogen at pleasure, as the pro-
gress of growth scemed to require.

Tn the following Table (XLV.) are given the numerical results of the experiments 0h
the question of the assimilation of free Nitrogen in which the plants were supplied with
combined Nitrogen beyond that contained in the 8eed 80Wn. See also figs. T7, 8, 9, 10,

plants with extraneous supply of combined Nitrogen, corresponding to the six above
