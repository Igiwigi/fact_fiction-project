When the point under consideration is inside the matter in the field there exists the
possibility of an additional contribution to this force due to local conditions of the
matter in the neighbourhood of the point, but for the present we shall disregard any
complication of this kind.

(b) C, the complete electric current; in the most general case this consists of
several distinct parts. Firstly, there is the differential drift of free ions constituting the
true conduction current and the material dielectric displacement current ; then there
is a part due to the convection of charged and electrically polarised media, and finally
the sethereal constituent essential and peculiar to MAXWELLâ€™s theory. It has been definitely established that all but the last constituent of the current
are in themselves true movements of electricity, or at least effectively equivalent to
such, so that so long as we retain the definite concept of an electrical entity the
origin of these different constituents merely remains a matter of kinematics, and they
have, in fact, been fully dealt with on this basis. *

(c) H, the magnetic force, defined in a similar manner to the electric force, with
the aid of the concept of a magnetic pole, but now without the possibility of a local
contribution due to surrounding magnetic polarity if the point is inside the matter. It is perhaps as well to emphasise the fact that both the electric and magnetic
forces are defined in a theoretical manner which almost excludes the possibility of
direct experimental verification.
