the pyriform cells described by AL1MAx, and figured by him as occurring in Gemmaria
implexaft. They are here termed gastric, because the fact that they occur only in the
mouthed zooids seems to render it probable that they exercise a digestive function.
"The mouthless zooids are long and slender in comparison with the mouthed ones. 'They
differ very much in length, as will be seen from the figure; the longest of them
measure about 13 millim. in length. They are cylindrical in form, tapering towards
