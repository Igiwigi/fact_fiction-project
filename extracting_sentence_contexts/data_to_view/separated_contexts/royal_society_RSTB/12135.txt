However, as there were
many genes without blast match and the annotation process can
overpredict gene content [34], we decided to take into account
only proteins in which, using a Pfam scan, we could find protein
domains. The proteomes of M. brevicollis and S. rosetta contain
approximately 70% of their proteins with a described Pfam protein
domain. Therefore, we considered this fact in our calculations
together with the average between the genomic completeness
obtained by BUSCO and CEGMA (taking into account complete

and fragmented proteins detected), to infer the total number of
proteins that UC1 and UC4 may have in their complete genomes. SAGs assembly and annotation are available at Figshare (https: //
doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7819571.v1), including the list of
protein classification.

(d) Genome size estimations UC1 and UG4

To estimate the genome sizes of UC] and UC4, we took the aver-
age of the percentage of presence of BUSCO and CEGMA
proteins (complete and fragmented), and the length of each
assembly. Then, we inferred the putative genomic size of UCI
and UC4 if the percentage was 100%.

(e) Ecological distribution of our SAGs

We performed a BLASTn v. 2.2.31 [49] using as query the 18S
sequences of our SAGs against the operational taxonomic units
(OTUs from the TARA Oceans database [55].
