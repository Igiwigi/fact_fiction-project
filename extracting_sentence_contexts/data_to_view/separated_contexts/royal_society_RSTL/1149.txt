380 Dr. Gray's Account of the Earthquake

I have ventured to propose the consideration of these mixed
causes,* if I may s0 term them, because I think it very cer-
tain that none of the theories hitherto formed respecting
earthquakes, are by any means adequate to explain their va-
rious phenomena. [ leave it to future theorists, should any
adopt the principle, to determine which of the elements is
concerned in a primary, and which in a secondary way ; also 1
what $hare in the attendant phenomena is to be assigned to n
each element. In whatever light the subject is viewed it seems to present
50 many difficulties, that perhaps the best we can do is, to
consider our knowledge respecting earthquakes as consisting
merely in a certain number of facts, to which many more must
probably be added, before we $hall be able to understand the
cause of a phzenomenon whose dreadful effects have, in all ages,
been too well known in every quarter of the world. So fre-
quent indeed are carthquakes in some parts, that it is impos-
sible, without being fully sensible of our happiness, to reflect

* Dr. Hares's theory of earthquakes was founded upon a sort of mixed cause: he
supposed sulphureous yapours to arise from the earth, and to form clouds, the explo-
Sive lightaing of which kindled the ascending vapours in the earth, and thereby caused
what he calls an earth lightning ; which lightning he considered as the immediate b]
cause of earthquakes. Yet, 50 imperfect was the aerial chemistry of those days, that -
the experiment by which he illustrates the operation of his sulphureous vapours, con-
Jists only in mixing together nitrous gas and common air, to show the red fumes, and
diminution of bulk produced.
