the Euplotid nuclear code are evidenced in grey (yellow online). (Online version in colour.)

regularities in the genetic code were clear from the very beginning (e.g. [7,8]).2 For example, in
most cases, codons sharing the first two nucleotides code for the same amino acid. Furthermore,
some biochemical properties of amino acids are correlated with specific nucleotides in different
codon positions; in fact, codons with the same nucleotide in the second position are associated to
similar amino acids; also, there is a correlation between the first base of codons and the precursors
from which the encoded amino acids should be synthesized [9,10]. The genetic code is a translation table that connects the world of nucleic acids, where biological
information is stored, to the world of proteins, the chemical bricks of cellular metabolism. The
genetic information is stored in double helix DNA molecules.
