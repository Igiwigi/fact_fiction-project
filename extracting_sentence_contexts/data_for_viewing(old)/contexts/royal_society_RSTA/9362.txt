The fact that after removal and re-application of load during the yielding process
flow again takes place at the lower yield stress (fig. 6) may readily be explained on this
view. Removal of load will be accompanied by removal of the elastic deformation,
or even reversal in the case of grains carrying little stress at the moment of removal.
The displacements due to slip will be unaffected except possibly for small adjustments
that may take place. Re-application of load will simply restore the pre-existing elastic
strain, and crystals which were then on the point of failing will again be in the same state.

As to the magnitude of the stress reduction which, according to the view here put
forward, may accompany the dislocation within an individual grain, nothing definite
can be stated. There are some grounds for supposing that the stress may even be
reduced to zero. The fact, for instance, that when the external load is reversed plastic
flow may, as shown by Roperrson, commence at zero load, would suggest that this

is the case. The simple removal of load would be sufficient to bring the elastic deforma-
tion of such grains to the critical value in the reverse direction.

Whether or not the above view of the process of yielding in mild steel is the correct
one, there is no doubt that the initial stage of plastic strain, both in uniform or non-
