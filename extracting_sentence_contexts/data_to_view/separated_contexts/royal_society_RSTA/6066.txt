Here, co is a constant of dimension +2 in natural units, closely related to A, and Hy is the scale
of inflation; v, and a are dimensionless coefficients. For a =0, we recover the low-energy form
of the RVM, equation (5.10), but only in the presence of higher powers of H beyond H? inflation
becomes possible. In fact, in the early universe the term H?P+2 is dominant and one can show
that inflation occurs for any p>1. Once more the participation of only even powers of H is
a requirement of general covariance of the action. The QFT-based model of inflation (7.1) just
corresponds to p=2, for which HÂ® is the driving force of inflation.
