Tf this be the view of contact theorists, the rival theories are mere
disputes about terms. If, however, the contact theory connects with the term con-
tact an idea of force which does or may produce a voltaic current independently of

chemical action, a force without consumption, I cannot but regard it as inconsistent
with the whole tenor of voltaic facts and general experience. Another point of theory suggested by the gas battery, is the relation of latent
heat in the different cells of the battery and voltameter. According to our received
theory of caloric, oxygen and hydrogen cannot assume the gaseons from the liquid
State without rendering sensible heat latent.
