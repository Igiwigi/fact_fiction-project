those at a pressure of 4 m.m., excepb thab the negative glow was more extended and
terminated in a fringe-like contour composed of filaments of light.

Pressure 3 m.m., 3947 M, 6300 cells, current 0:04901 W. Two stratified lumino-
sities as shown in Plate 9, fig. 6, copied from a dry-plate photograph obtained in
25 8econds, and a drawing made at the time; the negative was completely and very bril-
lantly illuminated. After a short time the two luminosities coalesced to form one at
the positive terminal, and between it and the negative there was a long dark discharge.
The outer boundary of the discharge from the positive is less bright than the fluores-
cent glow of the tube, as was the case with a discharge in air. Plate 10, fig. 19,
shows the phenomena of the discharge in tube 200 at the same pressure, with a current
of 0:03071 W; this exemplifies well the influence of the diameter of the tube on the
phenomena of stratification. In fact, in tube 199 we have not yet succeeded in
obtaining a steady stratification, while in tubes of a less diameter perfectly steady
strata are always obtained, although their form and number depend partly on the
dimensions of the tube, Part II., fig. 62a, p. 209.

Pressure 2 m.m., 2632 M, 6300 cells, current 0:04686 W. Strata for three-fourths
of the length of the tube, commencing at the positive in a point and enlarging to
about half the diameter of the tube as it approached the negative.

Pressure 1:5 m.m., 1974 M, 6300 cells, current 005801 W. The strata completely
filling the tube towards the negative in form like OC, tig. 87. The negative still more
brilliantly illuminated, the glow terminating as a fringe. The resistance of the tube
was found to be 63,000 ohms.
