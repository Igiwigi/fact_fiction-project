These tables and curves are not particularly striking, but they serve to show
graphically (1) that the growth of this bacillus in the medium given is slow at these
low temperatures, and (2) the effect upon the rate of growth of a difference of
temperature amounting to only about 2 degrees (cf Curves III-A and I). They
also show a peculiar rhythmic growth, especially in the case of Curve II, which
seems to be connected with cell-division, since it was observed that the appearance
of a septum was preceded by a period of retarded growth, and that as soon as the
septum was formed more rapid growth ensued. It is also interesting to note in
Curves III-A and IIL-B the acceleration of growth which accompanied the slow rise
of temperature caused by lighting an incandescent gas-burner shortly before four
o'clock. From these facts it is evident that the rapidity of growth, and therefore, by

* The longer period required for doubling in the case of the pair of rods, as compared with the terminal
rod, was due to irregularities which occurred in the rate of growth of the penultimate rod. At times the
growth of this rod almost or quite ceased, therefore the doubling period of the terminal rod alone repre-
sents more accurately the rate of growth of the organism,

inference, the period required for spore-formation, is dependent upon temperature,
and, furthermore, that the optimum is probably nearer 30° C. than 20°C. As to the
minimum temperature at which growth occurs, the following facts are of interest,
