Solution
wIf ammonia attacks it rapidly, and transforms it into oxamide and allylic alcohol. An
Slcoholic solution of ammonia added with caution 80 as to avoid the formation of
Sxamide, produces a substance analogous to oxamethan, which, for this reason, we shall
Mexignate by the name allyloxamethan. 'This substance separates in magnificent crystals
Ayhen its alcoholic solution is allowed to evaporate spontaneously. Z Potassium and sodium energetically attack the oxalate of allyl, especially with the aid
Sf heat, an evolution of carbonic oxide ensues, whilst there passes over on distillation a
Aimpid colourless oil of an aromatic odour, lighter than water ; this is in fact the carbonate

If allyl.
= The analysis of the oxalate of allyl has furnished the following results :—
5 I. 0-179 grm. of substance gave 03695 grm. of carbonic acid and 0-0951 grm. of water. Q II. 0-320 grm. of a second specimen gave 0662 grm. of carbonic acid and 0-170 grm.
