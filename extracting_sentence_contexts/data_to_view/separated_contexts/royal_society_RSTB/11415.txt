I argue that afterlife beliefs are supported by a wide-ranging human dispo-

sition to feel connected to, think about and talk about attachment figures, despite
their physical absence.

2. Two conceptions of death

As they get older, children growing up in a variety of cultures realize that death
inevitably comes to all living creatures and is an irreversible transformation [1]. The exact age at which they realize those biological facts varies but, barring
cognitive pathology [2], children typically attain those insights by 10 years of
age [3]. More recent research has focused on how children conceive the sequelae
of death. I argue that many children, and adults, are inclined to adopt two par-
allel conceptions of death—a biological conception in which they think of the
deceased as a dead corpse and an afterlife, or religious, conception in which
they think of the deceased as someone who has departed this life but lives
on elsewhere in some form.
