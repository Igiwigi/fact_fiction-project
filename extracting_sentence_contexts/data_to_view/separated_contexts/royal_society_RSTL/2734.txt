Buxr, who is constructing Tide-Tables for Bristol, have also collected this
inequality from observations. But the connexion of the inequality, as it exists in
different parts of the world, was never brought into view till the discussion of the
European and American observations of last June. The laws which the inequality
follows when thus considered on an extensive plan appear to me to be yery curious,
as they result from this examination of the facts; and I now proceed to explain
them. :
- 23, The inequality is most clearly een in the heights of high water. I exhibited
the results in curves, by erecting a series of ordinates at equal distances to represent
the heights of the successive high waters above a fixed point at each place ; and the
curves which were thus produced showed, in most places, a series of parallel zigzags
(the tides being alternately higher and lower); and these curves were 80 regular, and
80 exactly accompanied each other, as to prove both the goodness of the observations
and the existence of the diurnal inequality. This was the case, in the most marked
manner, on the coast of America, where scarcely any exception occurred.
