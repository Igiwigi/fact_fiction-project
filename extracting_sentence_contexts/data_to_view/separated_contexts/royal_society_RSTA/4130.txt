Here, quantum-like Jeffrey conditioning provides the most consistent scheme of PU and learning. Finally, we
remark that here PU has to be treated not so straightforwardly as in the classical Bayesian approach where PU is the update
ofa prior probability to a posterior probability. In the quantum-like model, this ‘update’ is, in fact, the assignment of subjective
probability to the hypothesis H on the basis of the reference self-measurement on the belief state p.


in (5.1) goes to zero. Thus, new Jeffrey conditioning differs from ‘conventional one’ by appearance
of additional terms (of the interference type) correcting the classical conditioning. We also remark
that, in contrast to QBist FTP (3.3), our FTP is valid even for infinite-dimensional state spaces.
