more recent extensions. Subsequently, we discuss limitations
of both frameworks in relation to empirical observations
from the biological and cognitive sciences and suggest ways
for future research to move beyond these frameworks.

2. Building blocks and sequential structure

Before discussing models of structure building and sequence
generation, we must first consider what the building blocks
are from which sequences, be it in language, music and
animal vocalizations, are built. One of the classic universal
‘design features’ of natural languages is ‘duality of patterning’
[15], which refers to the fact that all languages show evidence
of at least two combinatorial systems: one where meaningless
units of sounds are combined into words and morphemes,
and one where those meaningful words and morphemes are
further combined into words, phrases, sentences and discourse.
While many of the details are debated, the assumption that
words are building blocks of sentences is uncontroversial [16].
Like language, music and animal songs combine units of
sound into larger units in a hierarchical way, but the compar-
ability of the building blocks and the nature of the hierarchies
of language, music and animal songs is not at all straightfor-
ward. In particular, there is no clear analogue of a ‘word’ in
music or animal songs [17,18].
