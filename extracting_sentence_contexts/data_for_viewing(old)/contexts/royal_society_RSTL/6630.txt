Perhaps the best way of doing s0 is to refer to the * Prefatory Note” to Principal

him in 1846, are to be regarded as having the ry meaning as the NR 65A < fracture
and regelation,” first introduced into the snbject in 1857. Now there is od ambiguity
whatever in this latter expression. © Fracture” means the breaking and splitting of the
ice regarded as a brittle and crystalline s0lid, and could never be intendes to have the
slightest reference to viscosity. In fact the expression is altogether inapplicable to any
body which can be called viscous, without what I should regard 858 violation of scien-
titic language. Still this, it may be 8aid, may be onlya want of striot accuracy of expres-
Sion, rather than of accuracy of conception. But if a notion of cracking and breaking, 80
foreign to any idea of plasticity, should be admitted, it could not be said that a glacier
moved as it is observed to move because it was plastic, but merely that it moved as if
it were plastic. The true inference from the motion would have been that glacial ice
possessed not necessarily real plasticity, a definite property of bodies, but a quasi-plasti-
city, which expresses no determinate property at all, but may consist with many different
properties. It merely expresses, in fact, the power of the component elements of the
mass of changing to a certain extent their relative positions. But this is not the pecu-
liar property of ice; it is common, indeed, to all bodies exposed to disruptive forces
which, as in the case of ice, the cohesive power is unable to withstand. The mass of
