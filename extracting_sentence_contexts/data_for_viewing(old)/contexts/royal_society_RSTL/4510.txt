tric action which have since arisen; and we may transfer the ideas and mode of
thought without making any hypothesis as to the mutual relation of the phenomena.
This is not the place to enter fully on this question, and I shall confine myself to the
application of these principles to explain certain phenomena of change in compound
substances, to which I shall presently show the parallel in the case of the element.
These phenomena are those which go under the name of the © phenomena of the
nascent state.”

Silver cannot be oxidized by the direct action of oxygen on the metal, but oxide
of sIlver is readily formed by boiling the chloride of this metal with potash. The
particles of oxygen and silver have therefore acquired by this association with the
chlorine and potassium a chemical relation or affinity which at other times they
have not. This is the fact. The rational conception of the fact is given in the ex-

in which I have indicated the polar relation of the snbstances. The chemical re-
lation therefore between the oxygen and sllver is essentially dependent on the che-
mical relation between the oxygen and potassium, in the same way as a negative
and positive electricity are related to each other. The same is true of the relation
between any other two particles of the system. Hence chemical decomposition is an
essential condition of chemical combination ; 80 that when we see one of these eyents
