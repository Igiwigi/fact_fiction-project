the zooid z. of fig. 202. The three other zooids are evidently placed with reference to
pÞ. and not to p?. Thus the zooid d”. has its ventral chamber turned towards the
centre of the main group and away from that of the secondary group. Hence d”. is
the offspring of p!. and the grandchild of p'.

There appear to be in fig. 203 two other secondary centres, but each is repre-
gented by two or three zooids only. Thus a, b, and c seem to be arranged about the
centre y, while d', e, and perhaps f, are arranged about a centre at 2. Tt is rare to find
the secondary groups completely or symmetrically formed, and in many, perhaps most,
cases no secondary centres can be certainly identified. In fact, I have seen only two
cages in which the secondary groups were as perfectly formed as at w. in fig. 208.

E The close correspondence between the mode of budding of the zooids and of the
Zsexual polyps must already have struck the attention of the reader. If the group of
S four zooids shown in fig. 199 be compared with the group consisting of three sexual
Wpolyps and the exhalent zooid (fig. 181) the composition of the two groups is found to
Sbe the game. Tf the axial polyp in fig. 181 be turned upwards at its anterior part, as
'Sactually happens at a later stage, it will have the same relation to the exhalent zooid
Sus that existing between the lower and upper zooids of fig. 199, and the two lateral
