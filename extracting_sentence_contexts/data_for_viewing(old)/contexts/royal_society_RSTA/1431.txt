(up to 3xCC) for hourly extreme precipitation in Australia. A full review of this topic can be
found in [44] and this suggests that extreme sub-daily precipitation will increase at the CC rate,
or higher. This, coupled with the fact that we expect large-scale circulation changes to affect
sub-daily precipitation extremes less than thermodynamic drivers and that we have reasonable
understanding of the thermodynamic feedbacks, means that the confidence in our understanding
of the effect of climate change on extreme sub-daily precipitation is nearly as high as for daily
extreme precipitation.

Event attribution studies of extreme rainfall events have used a variety of approaches
including the statistical analysis of observational data and the analysis of large ensembles of
climate model simulations. There is no a priori reason to expect different types of intense storms
to respond in the same way to higher temperatures, and studies have so far not separated storm
types. In fact, there is substantial evidence that changes to the most intense storms may be
quite different than changes to more frequent, less intense storms of the same type [122,135,136].
The literature on the effect of climate change on tropical cyclones is rapidly expanding due to
advances in computing and high-resolution climate modelling. Intense tropical cyclones (TC)
are readily identifiable in both the real world and in appropriate high-resolution simulations
[137], placing them relatively high and to the right in figure 3, with attributable increases of
the risk of extreme rainfall found for Hurricane Harvey [43,118]. Intense extratropical cyclones
(ETC) are well simulated in a wider class of climate models but are not as readily identified in
models or reanalyses [138,139] placing them to the left of intense tropical cyclones, although event


attribution was performed for the August 2016 flood-inducing event in South Louisiana [140]
Atmospheric rivers (AR) and frontal systems pose similar identification problems [141,142] so
