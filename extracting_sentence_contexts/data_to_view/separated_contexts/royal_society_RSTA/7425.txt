If the applied forces are held constant,
the total energy of the system (internal energy of the body plus potential energy of the sources
of external force) is a function of the set of parameters necessary to specify the configuration
of the imperfections. The negative gradient of the total energy with respect to the position of
an imperfection may conveniently be called the force on it. This force, in a sense
fictitious, is introduced to give a picturesque description of energy changes, and must not
be confused with the ordinary surface and body forces acting on the material. Even if there is only a single imperfection in the body and no externally produced stresses
the force on it will not in general vanish. This ‘image force’ will depend on the shape of the
boundary of the body and on the variation of the elastic constants from point to point in it.
