38, 40, 41, 66, 70, 72); and obseryations more recently made, but only alluded to in
par. 72, have proved that in air of ordinary density a cold body repels.

On the supposition that air-currents are the motive power, the effects noticed when
the source of heat is internal to the tube, and applied aboye the moying beam (37, 39,
40, 41, 45), are inexplicable, whilst they are easily comprehended on the repulsion-by-
radiation hypothesis.

If an additional argument is necessary to show that air-currents are not the cause of
the repellent action of a hot body, I bring forward the fact that the movement attains its
maximum when there is no air at all present (54, 55, 68).

79. Effects probably due to this repulsive action of radiation are constantly met with.
I will instance the following :â€” -

Cohesion and adhesion are diminished by heat. This naturally follows if inereased
temperature augments the force of repulsion between the molecules.

The phenomenon of the spheroidal state is probably due in some measure to a re-
pulsive force exerted between closely approximated bodies, one of which is at a very
high temperature. This action is generally supposed to take place only when one of
the bodies is volatile, and the rapidly formed skin of vapour is held to be a sufficient
