3 $6. ON THE EFFECT OF CoMPRESSING THE STEM.

mA diminished water supply may be readily produced by compressing a branch in a
fice. In this way it has been shown* that the transpiration current diminishes,
facreasing again when the compression is removed. The experiments that have been
fade on this point have been directed to the amount of water absorbed by cut stems,
t, as far as I know, to the actual amount of transpiration. The fact that the
el pressure increases during compression would seem to show, as might be
Gxpected, that the loss of water is not diminished in proportion to the diminished
spiration current.
£ My present experiments tend to show that transpiration is not immediately or even
#pidly diminished.

Indeed, in some cases the first obvious effect is increased transpiration, which I

fissume to be due to opening of the stomata.
