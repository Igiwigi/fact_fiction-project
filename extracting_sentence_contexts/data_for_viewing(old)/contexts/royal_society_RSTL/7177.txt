She —e small.

= In the Resistance the two parts, the difference of which makes up the D, are very
mich larger than in the Defence, though the resulting value of D is less.

The comparison of the values of D and of @ and & in the compasses of the Royal
-Dak with those in the compasses of the Hector and Valiant is very instructive. These
Ibips are nearly alike in dimension, in the arrangement of the iron-plating, and the posi-
Zion of the compasses. 'The Royal Oak has an iron upper deck, but is otherwise wood-
Suilt. 'The Hector and Valiant are entirely iron-built.
= A first inspection of the Table might lead us to infer that the large value of D in the
S on-plated ships is due to the armour-plating at the sides, but the comparison with the
Royal Oak shows this not to be the case. In fact a little consideration will show that,
Bs regards longitudinal induction, the effect of armour-plating continued from end to end

to produce a —a; that, as regards transverse induction, the effect of the parts which
Fun fore and aft is to produce a small +e, and the effect of the transverse parts near
Ahe extremities of the ship to produce a small —e, 8 that on the whole the tendency is
probably rather to diminish than to increase D. The large value of D in the iron ships
is evidently attributable to the increased amount of transverse iron in decks, bulkheads,
iron beams, and the iron bottom of the ship, the magnetism of which is, as it were, con-

ducted upwards by the iron sides.
