is derived, the latter term being due to the above-mentioned term in the current.


FUNDAMENTAL FORMULATIONS OF ELECTRODYNAMICS. 225

This last remark points to the possibility of obtaining an elementary deduction of
the expression

E+ a [ms B]

for the complete electromotive forcive simply by calculating »the rate of change of
intrinsic energy of a moving bi-pole, and the calculation has in fact been carried out
by Larmor,* taking however a parallel plate condenser with equal and oppositely
charged plates, moving in a uniform magnetic field.

An’analogous argument in the magnetic case will give a deduction of the magneto-
motive forcive |

9. We have stated that the magnetic energy expressions just obtained are
effectively equivalent to those usually derived, whereas as a matter of fact this is true
only of the final result ; the various formule employed in the derivation of this result
