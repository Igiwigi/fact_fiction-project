The horse-shoe nucleus, the large single round nucleus, or the same dividing
small nucleus either single or in the act of division, and leucocytes with two, thre
four nuclei, are all commonly seen within the vessels (fig. 39). In one specimen I saw a leucocyte whose large single nucleus was in the
division into four by fragmentation (fig. 398); this, however, is an except
specimen, the commonest are those represented in fig. 39. The absence of the phenomena of diapedesis, the absence of wandering leuco
in either the deep or superficial layers of the mucosa, and the fact that leucocytes
no part in the re-formation of the tissue are points of no little interest, and re
further notice. CoHNHEIM asserted that colourless corpuscles of the blood are a source of the
tissue which an inflammatory process may produce, and he is supported by yar
writers, meution of whom is made in a paper by SHerRineron and Baxance (65

Amongst these perhaps the chief supporter of CoHNHEIM’s view is Zrrq@
(86, 87). SHERRINGTON and BALANCE also give a list of writers who deny to
migrating leucocytes any power of further development, and seek to show by
own experiments that CouNHEIM and ZIEGLER are wrong.
