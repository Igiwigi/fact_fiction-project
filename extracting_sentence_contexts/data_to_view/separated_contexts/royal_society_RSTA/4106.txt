This would reduce
the percentage of “mentally dull,” and, owing to the association between defects,
would also reduce indirectly the percentages of those with other defects. A proportion
of the decrease one would expect to take place from natural selection, but probably
a small proportion. We have, in fact, selective mortality, selection by mental
capacity, and growth (change in the individual), all acting together as causes of
change—and very probably also initial differences between the groups from which
the older and younger children sprang—precisely as was indicated in the previous
discussion on pp. 299-300. § 63.
