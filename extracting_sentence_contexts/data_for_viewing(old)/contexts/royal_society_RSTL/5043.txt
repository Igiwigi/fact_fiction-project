it with incredible rapidity. The entire contents of the system of the true-hlood can in
no single instance be withdrawn from its vessels (except in very small quantities)
compatibly with the preservation of life. Hence another fundamental difference be-
tween the physiological history of the blood-system and that of the chylaqueous.
How significantly that of the latter speaks as to the © simplicity” of the living
organism in those orders of which it constitutes the exclusive means of nutrition !

Echinodermata.—Physiologists, from TiEpeEMANN to MULLER, commonly describe in

this family three distinct systems of fluids ; that, 1st, of the general cavity of the body;
that, 2ndly, of the feet and water-canals ; and that, 3rdly, of the blood-proper. The
doctrine which maintains the perfect independence of these three orders of fluids, is
advocated by these two illustrious anatomists. Facts will now be adduced which
render it probable that these three apparently independent systems constitute really
only a single indivisible fluid-system. They will be found to warrant no other con-
clusion than that in Echinoderms the system of the blood-proper is s0 rudimentarily
formed, that its contents, by some means and in some undetermined manner, commu-
nicate and mingle with those of the general cavity of the body, since in every histolo-
gical character the morphous elements and chemical compositions of the two fluids
prove, under every mode of inquiry, to be identical. From the same method of
examination, the inference is confidently drawn that the contents of the vascular
system of the feet (* Das Wassergefisssystem ” of MULLER and TiepeMANN) are iden-
tical, chemically and histologically, with those of the visceral cavity. But, though
rudimentary, the blood-proper system in the Echinoderms does exist. As regards its
central channels, it is easy, by injection and inflation, to verify the descriptive state-
