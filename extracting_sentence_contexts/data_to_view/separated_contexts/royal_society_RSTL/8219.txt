And to this early machinery may be ascribed the production, as by a mighty mill,

* Daxa (American Journ. Sci. 1847) has, however, shown a different possible cause for the greater prevalent
stecpness of mountain-ranges on one of their flanks, viz. the greater intensity of the tangential pressure at the
less steep flank, or smaller resistance of the materials of the opposite one. This, however, gives no solution
of the very general fact of western flanks being the steepest.â€”March 1873. f :

more or less stratified rocks, or of others of like character that may have preceded them.

57. At length the crust became further indurated, and with its viscous bed beneath
greatly thickened and convection cut off by it, as well as its coefficient of contraction
diminished, arrived at that state in which it was thick enough to transmit tangential
stresses within its own sheet.
