Gristicated air, and after that a little common air, were added, in order to see whether
Sthe cessation of diminution was not owing to some imperfection in the proportion of
‘the two kinds of air to each other; but without effect. The soap-lees being then
Zpoured out of the tube, and separated from the quicksilver, seemed to be perfectly
gneutralised, and they did not at all discolour paper tinged with the juice of blue
flowers. Being evaporated to dryness, they left a small quantity of salt, which was
evidently nitre, as appeared by the manner in which paper, impregnated with a
gsolution of it, burned.”

& Attempts to repeat CAVENDISH’s experiment in CAVENDISH’s manner have only
increased the admiration with which we regard this wonderful investigation.
Working on almost microscopical quantities of material, and by operations extending
Eover days and weeks, he thus established one of the most important facts in
Achemistry. And what is still more to the purpose, he raises as distinctly as we

{+ The explanation of combustion in Cavenpisn’s day was still vague. It was generally imagined
that substances capable of burning contained an unknown principle, to which the name ‘ phlogiston’
was applied, and which escaped during combustion. Thus, metals and hydrogen and other gases were
said to be ‘ phlogisticated ’ if they were capable of burning in air. Oxygen being non-inflammable was
named ‘ dephlogisticated air,’ and nitrogen, because it was incapable of supporting combustion or life
was named by Priestiny ‘ phlogisticated air,’ although up till Cavenpisu’s time it had not been made to
unite with oxygen.
