6. THE TRANSMISSION OF WAVES THROUGH A SINGLE GAP IN A BREAKWATER

We suppose now that there is a gap of breadth 4, in a very long breakwater, on which
waves are incident normally. If the gap is small, i.e. b small compared with the wave-length A
of the incident waves, the gap will behave like a point source, semicircular waves diverging
from it and having the same height practically all round any semicircle. If, however, the
gap is larger than a wave-length, the energy of the waves penetrating the gap will be propa-
gated mainly in the original direction of the incident waves; the wave pattern at consider-
able distances from the gap will still be approximately semicircles, but the wave heights will
vary along these semicircles, being greatest in the direction of propagation of the incident
waves. It will be shown that, when 4 is greater than A, a good approximation can be obtained
by superposition from the solution for the semi-infinite barrier already considered. In fact
this method gives an exact solution for all values of b when one of the barriers is of the rigid
type and the other of the cushion type, and this solution is therefore given first, though it is
unlikely to be of practical interest on its own account.

We take the origin at the centre of the gap, the x-axis along the breakwater and the y-axis
in the direction of propagation of the incident waves. The problem now reduces to finding
a function F(x, y), satisfying equation (8) together with the boundary condition dF /dy = 0
or F = Oat y = 0, |x| >40, according as the breakwater is of the rigid or cushion type, and
containing a term e~” for y negative, corresponding to the incident waves.

Now if we suppose for the moment that the part of the breakwater to the left of the gap
(i.e. for x< — 4b) is removed, we have the case of a semi-infinite barrier for which the solution
