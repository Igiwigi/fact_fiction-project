He gave the right explanation in so far as he explained the occurrence of three
pairs of dorsalia by the occurrence of two pairs of “ intercalaries,” these being, of course,
a pair of interdorsals and a pair of supradorsals, the latter having wedged themselves
in instead of remaining on the top.

Kontuker (‘ Wiirzburg, 1860) in referring to Heptanchus, remarked that “bei
Heptanchus im hinteren und vorderen Theil der Wirbelsiiule die Zahl der Wirbel um
das Doppelte grésser ist als in der Mitte.” This is a most unfortunate mode of
description, and has caused many misunderstandings, It would have been better to
say that the number of vertebral centra (not ‘“‘ Wirbel ”) in the middle of the trunk is
only half that of those in the ends of the trunk. But the simple fact is this: in the
middle of the trunk of Heptanchus the length of each vertebral centrum is double
that of the centra in the anterior and posterior portion of the trunk; the arcualia all
being of the same size, it follows that the long centra carry more arcualia than the
short centra. It is the variable length of the chorda centra which causes the discrepancies. Thus, in Heptanchus, there correspond with each centrum of the middle of the trunk,
about four pairs of dorsalia (and these happen to be two pairs of basidorsalia and two
pairs of interdorsalia, as proved by the number of nerve exits) so that each long
centrum actually belongs to two true segments; in Miniur’s Zygeena there happen
to be three pairs of dorsalia, in other specimens strictly speaking two and a half or
three, and these happen to be the dorsalia of one segment, namely, basidorsal and
interdorsal and supradorsal intercalated.
