which is not closed since the evolution in time of the vector solution N(t) depends on the : 2
mean number of contacts x;. Since the Q; components, under the same hypothesis on the : >

integrating with respect to the contact variable, it is possible to recover a further macroscopic : -
set of equations describing the constrained dynamics of the mean number of social contacts : <

general, the system of macroscopic equations which can be obtained by integration of (2.22) over : &
the number of social contacts is not closed. In fact, system (2.23) depends on the time evolution :B
of x;(t), i= S,E,1, A, R while the system giving the time evolution of x;(t), i= S, E,1, A, R depend : Ss
upon second-order moments of the fi(x,t), i= S,E,1,A,R. This represents nothing else than the

classical so-called closure problem often encountered in kinetic theory [17].

However, letting t > 0 forces the distributions f;(x, t) to converge towards the Gamma vector
distribution of components (2.7) with mass fractions Nj(t), and local mean values x;(t), i¢C =
{S, E, 1, A, R}. This amounts to assuming that social dynamics are much faster than epidemic
dynamics. In this situation, it is possible to obtain a closed set of macroscopic equations. In
particular, the second order moments of the distributions f;(x, t) can be explicitly computed in
terms of the mass fractions and mean values resorting to (2.8). This gives the system
