On the other hand, when J,a arose as a complete
and symmetrical leaf the original presumptive area of I,, if it was to any extent “ deter-
mined ” at the time of the operation, must have been completely de-differentiated again
as a result of the wound. Consequently the I,a leaves must have arisen not by re-
organization but as completely new leaves, as soon as spaces were available for them
both wide enough and far enough below the growing-point. This explanation is supported by the facts already mentioned, that the I,a bracts
arose sooner than the I,a leaves, and that they covered much smaller arcs. Indeed the
bracts originated almost entirely from part of the normal primary presumptive area of
I,, as will be shown in section 11 and Table V, whereas the I,a leaves extended far beyond
this area. Incidentally, it may be pointed out that the smallest of the bracts covered
an arc of 60°, so that it appears that parts of the presumptive area of I, that are smaller
than this cannot give rise by themselves to any structure at all.
