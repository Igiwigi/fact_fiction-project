They are bordered by
radioactive staining in a manner resembling the artificial halo of Ruraerrorn,
which also is an emanation halo, The border may be very faint or very dark. Its
radial extension is in general very much the same as that of the first ring of the
uranium halo, And in many cases we can quite easily detect that the border is
due to a succession of minute haloes whose centres are set close together along
the conduit. The border in these cases consists, in fact, of a number of overlapping
circles or rings, having approximately the radius of the first ring. But every here and there one of the larger rings—the originating ring of the
emanation halo—is found among the others. Examination shows in such cases a
nucleus extending into the conduit, consisting of a refracting particle.
