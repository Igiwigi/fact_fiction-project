The tania, taking a straight course to the inferior cava, forms a base
from which the pectinate bands sweep slightly away around the body of the right
auricle ; it terminates above near the head of the node where muscle bands stream in
like the ribs of a fan and concentrate from appendix, body of right auricle, septum
and inter-auricular band, eager to act as outgoing messengers (figs. 8, 13, 16, and 21). The collection of fibres at this region is remarkable ; we name this focus the “ concen-
tration point.” A discussion as to whether right or left auricle first contracts is evidently
unprofitable in the face of our facts. Certain portions of the right auricle contract
before certain portions of the left auricle, and vice versd. Rare or PropaGation or THE Excrratory Process.
