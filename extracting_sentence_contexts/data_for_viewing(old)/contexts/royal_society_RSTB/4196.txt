seat of lesion were also cut. These nerve trunks were the suprascapular, the branch
to the outer cord of the plexus, and the branch to the posterior cord of the plexus
joining with that from the seventh root. After this excision the three peripheral
ends were joined to the two central ends, namely, to the anterior primary divisions of
the fifth and sixth cervical nerves. For the purpose of considering the distribution

of the roots of the plexus, the importance of the procedure in the operation when
excision was practised lies in the fact that both fifth and sixth roots were divided.
In an older patient, in whom partial recovery had occurred, it might be expected that
section of the fifth and sixth roots would cause an addition to the paralysis, but
hitherto I have in these older cases confined the operative intervention to removal of
compressing scars. Of the many excisions in infants, however, none have shown
increase of the distribution of the paralysis after the operation, although that has
involved the excision of the segment of junction of the fifth and sixth nerves. This
has an important bearing on the question, for if the lesion which brings about this
form of paralysis is due to the destruction of the fifth root alone, and the sixth had
in these cases only been apparently damaged, then the excision of the undamaged
sixth, and therefore the destruction of a root contiguous to that which had already
been destroyed, would, in accordance with what is known of the brachial plexus,
bring about an evident addition to the paralysis already present. Harris considers
