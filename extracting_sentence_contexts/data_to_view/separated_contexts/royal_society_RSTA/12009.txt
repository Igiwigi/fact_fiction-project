What is required in order to obtain a decisive positive result is, that the assump-
tion of a purely cyclic character for the motions associated with permanent magnets
shall be avoided by giving the elasticity of the medium some kind of grip on them
The movements of rotation and vibration of the simple vortices which constitute @
vortex-aggregate are not competent to secure this, however sudden they may be, fo
in the irrotational fluid motion the constraint of the rotational elasticity has only te
reduce a labile condition of the medium into a stable one ; thus there is no sensib
play of elastic energy introduced, such as would be required to explain induction in a
steady magnetic field. THE ELECTRIC AND LUMINIFEROUS MEDIUM. 807

One way of bringing about this desired interaction of magnetic with clastic energy,
the same time safeguarding the permanence-of the atomic current, would be to
make it a current of convection, 7.c. to suppose the core of the vortex-ring to be made
up of discrete electric nuclei or centres of radial twist in the medium. The circulation
of these nuclei along the circuit of the core would constitute a vortex which can move
bout in the medium, without suffering any pressural reaction on the circulating nuclei
uch as might tend to break it up; the hydrodynamic stability of the vortex, in fact,
uffices to hold it together. But its strength is now subject to variation owing to
astie action, so that the motion is no longer purely cyclic. A magnetic atom,
onstructed after this type, would behave like an ordinary electric current in a non-
dissipative circuit.
