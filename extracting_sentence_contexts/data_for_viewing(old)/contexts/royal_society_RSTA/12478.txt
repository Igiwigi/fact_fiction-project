} EB cooling slowly.* That a high temperature is required is well exhibited by the
@ behaviour of JonNson and NepHEWw’s iron wire. This had been raised by the makers
g to a temperature above dull red, and the wire was rendered by their annealing
S exceedingly soft and, moreover, for high, or rather comparatively high, magnetising
& forces, of great magnetic permeability ; but annealing in the Fletcher's furnace at the
& temperature of 1000° C. nearly doubled the permeability for very minute magnetising
= forces, and more than doubled the internal friction. The annealing, by passing the
S wire slowly several times through the flame of a Bunsen’s burner, so as to heat
all parts equally to a bright red, does not seem satisfactory, partly, it may be, because
‘3 a sufficiently high temperature is not reached, and partly, doubtless, because the
ig cooling is too rapid ; in every instance, annealing by Fletcher's furnace at the tempera-
£ ture of 1000° C., produced higher values of both A and B than annealing by a Bunsen’s
burner. This last fact is especially noticeable in the nickel wire, where the annealing
with the furnace nearly doubled the value of A in the wire which had previously been
annealed with the burner, as well as by Mr. ANpDREws at the temperature of 580° C.
Professor Ewine has examined the magnetic permeability of nickel wire with very low
magnetising forces, and he finds the value of A for annealed nickel to be 22°4.t This
value is very much less than that obtained by the author for the thoroughly annealed

would make the permeability equal to 1 + 4a x 1°7 or 22'4.
