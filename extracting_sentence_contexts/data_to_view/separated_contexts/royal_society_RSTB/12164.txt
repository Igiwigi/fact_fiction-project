In this regard, cross-
species studies that adopt a comparative approach have yielded important
insights into ciliary structure and function [7].

e-mail: g.jekely@exeter.ac.uk Throughout the history of cilium research, there have been multiple cases
where findings in one species have proven consequential in a number of dis-
tantly related systems spanning the entire eukaryotic diversity. Comparative
approaches have not only driven molecular discoveries, but also our under-
standing of the static and dynamic aspects of cilia. In fact, we owe much of
our knowledge of basic ciliary biology and motility to Chlamydomonas reinhard-
tii, an easy-to-culture, genetically tractable green alga dubbed the ‘green yeast’
[8]. For instance, the phenomenon of intraflagellar transport (IFT)—the bidirec-
tional transport of proteins inside cilia—was discovered in Chlamydomonas [9]. IFT has since been shown to be present in most ciliated organisms [10,11], and is
critical to build cilia and to control length, ciliary sensing and many signalling
processes [12].
