If, however, the ring is to be
regarded as being in the nature of a central nervous system where impulses received
from the arms are sorted out and coordinated, it can well be seen that the necessity
for rapid conduction, as represented morphologically by the defined tracts of the
inner fibrillar zone, would be subordinated to a more amorphous arrangement of
fibrillae, better able to elicit a greater variety of response. On this supposition only
can a reasonable explanation of the fibrillar arrangement within the nerve ring be
given. 3—The General Ectoderm

In the account already given of the radial and circumoral nerve cords, attention
has been drawn to the fact that these cords are to be regarded merely as thickenings
of the general ectoderm, in which the greater part of the thickness is due to the
presence of an immense number of fibrillae. It would be expected, therefore, that
the ectoderm which clothes the surface of the starfish would be composed of the same
elements as are the cords. This is, in fact, so, but the elements of the general
ectoderm exhibit such great differences in form by comparison with the equivalent
elements of the cord that a separate description of them is necessitated.
