It is generally considered that, in the absence of a quantum theory of gravity, the issue
of singularities can be at present tacitly ignored, alleviated by their hiding behind horizons,
surfaces of infinite redshift of which no information can escape. However, this notion brought
up a different issue with the discovery by Hawking that the presence of horizons leads to the
evaporation of the black holes; the horizons effectively disrupt the quantum correlations of the
vacuum fluctuations allowed by the Uncertainty Principle, leading to the appearance of half of
the quanta (e.g. photons, e+ e~ -pairs) of these fluctuations on one side of the horizon (Hawking
radiation), while keeping the other half (of negative energy) on the horizon interior side to reduce
the BH mass, which slowly evaporates (the existence of such radiation is generic to the presence
of any horizon, not only to those of black holes; the radiation registered on one side of the horizon
of e.g. an accelerating detector called Unruh radiation). While the effect of Hawking radiation is
well formulated and it is not considered at present controversial, nonetheless, it leads to the so-
called ‘information loss paradox’, namely to the fact that the information of Hawking radiation is
all random, contrary to that which formed the BH; this implies violation of unitarity, one of the
cherished principles of quantum mechanics. To the best assessment of the authors of this note, a
well-accepted resolution of this paradox is currently lacking.

Besides the above issues, there are several others involving the gravitational interaction, but
these are generally attributed to our poor knowledge of the matter content and distribution that
produces the gravitational field which leads to the observed kinematics, rather than to deficiencies
of our understanding of the gravitational interaction. These are the so-called Dark Matter and
Dark Energy issues.

The first one concerns the rotation curves of spiral galaxies, which do not exhibit the
expected vg ~r~/? Keplerian fall-off at galactocentric distances as large compared to that of
