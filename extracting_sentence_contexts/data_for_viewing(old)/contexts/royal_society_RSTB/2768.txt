eventually be removed, since I have never found it present in ewes killed during the
ancestrous period.

That the dicestrous cycle of the sheep and the menstrual cycle in the Primates are
physiologically homolog√©us is rendered extremely probable in the light of the facts
summarised above, while it a further comparison be made with other Mammalia, and
more particularly the dog and the ferret, the probability becomes converted into a
certainty. The procestrum in the ferret, according to my own researches (an advanced
abstract of which is embodied in the present memoir), in regard to its severity is
almost intermediate between that of the sheep on the one hand, and the menstruation
of the Primates on the other.

(Estrus in the domestic sheep very rapidly succeeds the procestrum, so much so
that the period of desire seems sometimes to be coincident with the procestrum. But
this is where the procestrous process is less severe. When external bleeding does
occur in ruminants, as in bitches and ferrets, there is evidence that it takes place
prior to the actual cestrus period, this being known to be the case with certain
