In specimens of a very much later period (Plate 18. fig. L) the proximal portions of the
outgrowth are unquestionably continuous with each other, though their actual junctions
with the spinal cord are very limited in extent. The fact of this continuity at a later
period is strongly in fayour of the view that the posterior branches of the spinal neryes

of distal processes take their origin. TI have, however, failed to demonstrate this point

the later stages, equal in number to the muscle-plates.
