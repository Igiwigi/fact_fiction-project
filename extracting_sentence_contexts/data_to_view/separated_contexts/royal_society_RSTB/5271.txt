(b) The “ peak points ” below sea-level represent the actual mean thickness of strata
intervening between the coal seams of the 29 horizons and denote the amount of sub-

= sidence of the sea-floor to form the strata from one seam to another. S Lycopodiales = 0-20 feet (wet flora); Equisetales and Cordaitales = 20-100 feet

3 (intermediary flora) ; Filicales and Pteridosperms = 100-300 feet (dry flora). H Two significant facts come to light:—(q) pairs of seams, widely separated from one
another, show dominance of fern and fernlike plants or dry flora, and (6) pairs of seams,
close together, show dominance of the Lycopodiales or wet flora. 3 Fauna. a Faunal remains on the whole are somewhat rare, and of the different genera, Car-

oh honicola, Anthracomya and Naiadites are sometimes very rare.
