modes of origin were known in the same genus, nor was it generally realised that the
relative sizes of the two parts of the cone-scale are subject to considerable variation,
even in different regions of the same cone.

Thus THomson (1909) was led to believe that while in the Abietinew (and, by
inference, in the Taxodineze and Cupressineze) the cone-scale was evidently a double
structure and the ovuliferous organ a modified axillary shoot, in the Araucarinez and
Taxaceve (incl. Taxinese and Podocarpinez) the scale was simple, and the ligule of Arau-
caria and the epimatium of Podocarpus were mere excrescences of the upper surface.
He thus founded two great groups of Conifers, the Diplosporophyllous and the Aplo-
sporophyllous forms. This step has appropriately been criticised by Eames (1913, p. 33).

More recently, Miss AASE (1915) has published facts which are of value in this
connection, showing that the classification proposed by THomson is not tenable. A
glance at her fig. 1, p. 283, will show that, according to THomsonâ€™s classification, the
scales in the proximal region of the cone are aplosporophyllous, while those higher up
in the same cone are diplosporophyllous. In Pinus maritima, P. Banksiana,
Keteleeria fortunei, Cupressus Benthamii Miss Aase describes both types of vascular

* The vascular cylinder of the brachyblast is to be conceived of as having a gap opposite to the
subtending bract, as is usually the case with the vascular cylinder of the vegetative axillary shoot in its
basal region, not only in the Conifers but also in many Ferns. If the ovuliferous scale is really a branch,
it is evident that, strictly speaking, there is no sense in describing, as inverted, the strands on the side
opposite to that on which the bract is placed.
