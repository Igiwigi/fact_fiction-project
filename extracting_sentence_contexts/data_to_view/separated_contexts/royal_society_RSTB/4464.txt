The vascular bundles in the axils of the bracts are
shown in the figure, although, being paired, they would not actually be visible in a median section. The zylem strands are shown as thick longitudinal lines, the phloem as short transverse lines.

niently called the dorsal, is usually free of sterile bracts (Plate 11, fig. 22a, is the only

exception in my material); this is the side on which is situated, at the distal end of

the receptacle, the single, smooth, broadly rotundate, fertile bract (Carpidium,

Pixcer), easily distinguished from the sterile bracts by its shape and, of course, by

the fact that it subtends the seed. In Plate 11, fig. 22a, the fertile bract is seen

wedged in between the receptacle and the seed. The most distal sterile bract is
