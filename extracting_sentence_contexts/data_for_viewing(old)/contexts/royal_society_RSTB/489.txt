& Class I. Mode of natural recovery of respiration.

The effect of the increase of pressure has been just described, it now remains to
discuss the manner in which the respiratory centre begins to recover its function
unaided by artificial respiration.

Rarely the respiratory movements have continued although extremely reduced in
extent.

After the more usual complete arrest respiration very frequently reecommences by
an initial deep inspiration, and this is followed by another (gasps in fact), then
successive respirations follow in increasing order of depth. (See Tracing I.)

In fewer instances the respirations recommence not as gasps, but simply as shallow
movements increasing in extent.
