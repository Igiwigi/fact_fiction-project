The uniquely determined normal word representing / we call the normal form of p. Because of the theorem we may identify the elements of / with their normal forms. Then
¥ becomes a group of permutations of the elements of P; in fact, the elements of © are just
the right multiplications of P; with fixed ¢ = q¢ and for all pe P one has

po = pq. Y is called the regular permutation representation of P. It is well known that right multi-

plications and the regular permutation representation can be defined in the same way for
arbitrary groups, not only for free products with an amalgamated subgroup.
