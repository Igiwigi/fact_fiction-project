in the epoxide monomers used [28-32]. In fact, the exploitation of catalysts able to operate under is
immortal polymerization conditions, ie. where such chain transfer agents are added in larger Dw
excess compared to the catalyst, is essential to selectively prepare the polyols that are required in :
polyurethane manufacture [18,20,24]. :2

The catalysts for ROCOP have some general features: the metals are Lewis acids; the metalsâ€™ :s
redox reactivity should be limited; the metal alkoxide and carbonate intermediates are labile; :
and initiating ligands (X) include alkoxides, carboxylates, halides and other anionic groups
[5,8-14]. It is common in this area of catalysis that dinuclear or bimetallic catalysts show good
performances and bimetallic pathways are proposed to accelerate epoxide ring opening [10]. Finally, the polymerization catalysts should ideally be colourless, odourless, inexpensive and
have low toxicity, as they may contaminate the polymer product.
