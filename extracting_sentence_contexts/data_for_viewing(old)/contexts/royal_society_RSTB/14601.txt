while exploiting a limited resource R. Conversely, 1—x will
be the rest of the population, which would adhere to a non-
conservation policy. The last term, AU(x, R), introduces a differ-
ence between utilities [85]. Additionally, a dynamical equation
for R (i.e. dR/dt = ¢(x- R) is also used to introduce the specific
effects of human actions on the environment. Although the
standard response of such a resource to harvesting already
includes sudden transitions, the presence of agents that make
decisions and learn makes predictions more difficult due to
the emergence of new potential states and transitions. More
importantly, when conservation costs and resource abundance
interact, one possible outcome of these models is a spontaneous
evolution towards a regime shift [71,84]. This is in fact a crucial
element of future CHES developments: allowing parameters to
be part of the dynamical behaviour of the model.

4. Biodiversity, adaptation and engineering

As mentioned above, anthropogenic changes are taking place
rapidly, leading to a shrinking window of opportunity. What
is the ‘right’ scale for action? In previous sections, we have dis-
cussed several approximations involving monitoring
biodiversity and potential WS. In this section, we will briefly
review recent proposals associated with different ways of
approaching ecosystem degradation and biodiversity losses
