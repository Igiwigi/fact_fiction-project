W. L. BALLS ON ANALYSES OF AGRICULTURAL YIELD. that the rise of the flowering-curve, beginning with the date of the first flower,
depends on the soil-temperature, which in Egypt is roughly synonymous with the
latitude, though the subsequent rate of the rise may be affected by soil-fertility. These conclusions agree with practical experience up to a certain point, but they
offer no explanation of a fact which is common knowledgeâ€”to wit, that the Egyptian
crops, of some seasons are early, while others are late. It is not likely that there
should be any very striking difference in soil-fertility over all Egypt between one
season and the next, even in the event of an outbreak of cattle-plague. There must
consequently be some other operative cause, and this is very clearly indicated by our
data as being the available soil-water.
