casting itself.

Tn both these cases the pattern, in order to be extracted from the damp *rammed up”
sand, has to be © rapped ” by the workman—that is to say, he strikes the pattern in all
directions 80 as to make the cavity in the sand bigger than the size of the pattern, the
difference being for clearance to enable the withdrawal of the pattern. If the sand
mould be then dried and heated to something like redness, it will by expansion (on the
whole, for there may be some little contraction at first on drying) cause the cavity of the
mould to become till larger, and it is at this temperature that it receives the liquid
rock.

Hence the equality in size between the wood pattern and the again solidified rock,
even if exactly the fact, does not prove that there was no contraction, but that the
amount of contraction was equal to the enlargement of the cavity of the mould, equal
to the bulk of the pattern by the © clearance ” given to the latter by © rapping ”” and by
the further enlargement of the mould itself by heating ; and as neither the yolume of
the clearance (which is never the same in any two cases) nor the enlargement by expan?
Sion (which may vary with the quality of the materials of the mould at different times,
as well as with the temperature) are known, 80 no conclusion whatever can be drawn
from those data as quoted from Messrs. CHANCE.

138. Then as to Mr. Forsxs's own results, we surely cannot rely upon measurements
made upon blocks of slag cast into iron ingot moulds of only 10 inches long, 6 inches
wide, and 6 inches deep=360 cubic inches.
