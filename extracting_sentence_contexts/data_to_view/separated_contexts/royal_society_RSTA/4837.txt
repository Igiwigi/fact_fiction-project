There is an important and quite general property of the lattice function which must
now be explained. If a lattice be read by columns instead of by rows its specification
changes from a partition to the conjugate partition, and it is a trivial remark that the
generating function of partitions at the nodes is not altered. In fact, if the rows
POSSESS ,, My, ..., %, nodes and the columns J,, bg, ..., b, nodes

GF (1; a), ds, ..., dn) = GE (7; by, bs, ..., by). Moreover, since the generating function is the quotient of the lattice function by
an algebraic function which depends merely upon the number of nodes, it is clear

that
L( WD 5 My, Ag, ++, Gm) = L(o SOTO ss se) b,.)s

MG (Gerda; nus Che 1 (15 05, Dayne as On),

(4), @g, +++ Um) and (b,, by, ..., bn) being conjugate partitions. From the last written relation we find

(I-41) ... (I+ 3a)4 (1)...
