1m or less in length. The sediments consisted of a diatomaceous diamicton dominated by mixed
Miocene sediments, including common Lower Miocene diatomite clasts. The matrix included a
mixed assemblage of diatoms spanning Palaeogene to Upper Miocene ages, but none that were
unequivocally less than 9 Myr old. The cores were also characterized by a distinct colour change
at 10-18 cm beneath the surface [45]; the lower unit was greenish grey with relatively high total
organic carbon (TOC, 0.43%), whereas the upper unit was lighter in colour with lower TOC
(0.28%) [46]. Harwood et al. [47] found little significant difference between the two units with
regard to diatom assemblages, implying similar sediment provenance, but speculated that the
upper unit may represent an active biological layer influenced by exposure of Miocene sediment
to sub-ice shelf marine conditions, and debris rain-out from basal ice during grounding line
retreat. No Quaternary diatoms were found in RISP sediments, implying little accumulation of
advected materials beneath the ice shelf at this site. However, coring may have failed to recover
the true sedimentâ€”water interface [45,48]. That is perhaps borne out by the fact that modern


diatoms were found living in seawater in crevasses at nearby Crary Ice Rise [49], which would
be expected to accumulate on the nearby sub-ice shelf sea floor. In 1987, a sediment sample
was recovered (by accident) during hot water drilling (HWD) at the Crary Ice Rise. This sample
contained a Miocene diatom assemblage that was slightly younger than the youngest age at RISP,
but also contained no Pliocene or Pleistocene diatoms [48].

Major rotary drilling projects from a sea-ice platform began in 1975 with Dry Valley Drilling
Project Site 15 [50] and continued with the McMurdo Sound Sediment and Tectonic Studies
(MSSTS) [51], Cenozoic Investigations in the Western Ross Sea (CIROS) [52] and the Cape Roberts
Project (CRP) [53]. This body of work, together with the new drilling technologies developed,
