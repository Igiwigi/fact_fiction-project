ES But that a great range of variety in the mode of behaviour of these bodies prevails
gn the lower plants is shown by the fact that, according to Swinaxx,t the centrosomes
themselves persist in the intervals of rest between two successive nuclear divisions
Sn Sphacelaria, and thus we meet with a series of gradations extending from a
‘Zelatively permanent centrosome to one which is periodically renewed, or formed
afresh, at each period of nuclear division.
8, SrrRAsBuRGER states that in some of his own preparations he was able to trace an
‘ipparent connection between the position of the two centrospheres and the limits of

©" As the process of mitosis advances, the nucleus becomes richer in chromatin, and
this becomes aggregated into a coiled thread, just asin the higher plants. Ultimately
the coil breaks up into the definite number of chromosomes, and these are, as we have
already stated in our previous communication, twice as numerous as in the gometes.
STRASBURGER gives the number for F. serratus as 30, but we are inclined to place
