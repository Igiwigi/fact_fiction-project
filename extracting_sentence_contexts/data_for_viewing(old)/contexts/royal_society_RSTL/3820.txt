the addition of a few drops of lactic*, malic, racemic, or formic acids to solutions of
their neutral salts, produces a class of active decomposing agents, 80 effectual, that
either of them may be considered to afford secure means for discriminating the phos-
phatic from other varieties of calculi.

An interesting and perchance important circumstance connected with this part of
the subject, relates to the s/rength of the solution, which appears to be in inverse
ratio to its decomposing power. Thus, a saturated solution of acetate of lead,
acidulated pretty strongly with acetic acid, is inactive; whereas, one grain of the-salt,
with five drops of the acid, dissolved in one fluid ounce of tepid water, produces
rapid and steady decomposition.

This fact has been carefully verified by repeated experiments; for instance, the
moment a portion of calculus, which had been steadily decomposing in a weak solu-
tion, is plunged into a stronger, action abruptly ceases ; it is as suddenly re-esta-
blished when the assay is returned to the weaker solution. This alternation from
weak to strong, and the reverse, was often repeated with solutions variously modified,
but invariably with the same general result.

On first remarking the above circumstance, I was not aware that BerzeLius had
previously recorded a somewhat similar fact in relation to the action of weak solu-

* When a fragment of phosphatic calculus is placed in a solution of super-lactate of lead, under the mi-
croscope a dense areola at first surrounds it ; from this, after a time, radii proceed, until the assay assumes a
stellar appearance, of dazzling whiteness.
