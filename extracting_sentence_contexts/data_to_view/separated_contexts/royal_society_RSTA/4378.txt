It is the
male pedigree with which the recorder in nearly all cases occupies himself. Only those who have attempted the labour of extracting, as has been done in this
ease, some 16,000 separate returns, will fully grasp the difficulty of making the
limitations of selection more and more complex ; the quantity to be obtained becomes
dangerously small and the labour immensely increases. Even could with time and
patience a sufficient selection of ideal cases have been made, it does not follow that
the result would be satisfactory ; for, we should have made a narrow selection, and
this very fact might indicate that possibly we have been selecting one grade or class
of fertility. It is possible that the less fertile are the weaker, and so more liable
to die early ; or again it may be the more fertile women who are subjected to the
more frequent risk of childbed, and thus are less likely to appear in the selection of
long marriages. Even greater or less risk at birth may be an inherited character
in women, and may not unfairly be looked upon in itself as a factor limiting fertility
naturally.
