insertions depends on the FN charge of the quarks. Each VEV insertion leads to a suppression of order €, = (5) / As. Figure is

fermions live towards the UV brane so that the overlap between the fermions and the Higgs
is suppressed. On the other hand, heavy fermions such as the top quark are localized near the
IR brane. This set-up leads to a protection from large flavour and CP violation via the so-called
‘RS-GIM mechanisn’’.

The key feature for flavour physics is therefore the localisation of the fermions in the AdS5
slice, which determines the effective scale of higher-dimensional flavour-violating operators.
The profile of a fermion is determined by its five-dimensional bulk mass. Because of the AdS5
geometry, modifications of order 1 in the five-dimensional bulk mass have a substantial impact
on the fermionic profile and therefore on the effective four-dimensional Yukawa coupling. In fact,
the four-dimensional Yukawa couplings depend exponentially on the bulk mass parameter. RS
models are holographic duals of four-dimensional strongly coupled theories. In this picture, the
Higgs is part of the composite sector. The size of the Yukawa couplings is then determined by the
degree of compositeness of the states that are identified with the SM fermions. Indeed fermions
localized near the UV brane are dual to mainly elementary states leading to small Yukawas while
fermions localized near the IR brane map to mainly composite states with correspondingly large
Yukawas.

In the usual picture, the bulk mass parameter is assumed to be constant. On the other hand, it
is quite well motivated to consider that this bulk mass is dynamical and generated by coupling
the fermions to a bulk scalar field which in turn obtains a VEV. We can then expect a position-
dependent bulk mass as this VEV is generically not constant along the extra dimension. In
