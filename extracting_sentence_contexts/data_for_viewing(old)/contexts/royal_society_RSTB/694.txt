devoid of all traces of secondary xylem; but when we come to stems of the latter
plant 2 feet in diameter, we find in them the most magnificent examples of a
secondary zone of wood that I have yet met with. This fact has only become
known to us through a rare and fortunate accident. We find in our Coal-Measures
very many, even large, Lepidodendroid and Sigillarian Trees, but unfortunately these
are all mere casts of the outer surface of the cortex, each interior being only a mass
of inorganic clay or sand. Hence we know nothing of what the internal organization
of these arborescent forms was. But the Arran stems have been preserved for us
under very different conditions. They have been imbedded, not in sand and mud
like those ordinarily met with, but in volcanic ash. Their central vascular axes,
with their contained medullw, are as perfect as they were in the living plants. Not
only so, but much of their cortex is equally well preserved. But for this happy and
unique circumstance, we should have been entirely ignorant of the fact that a
Lepidodendron might attain to a considerable magnitude without any trace of a
secondary vascular zone making its appearance in its stem, and yet, ere it attained to
its ultimate dimensions of a noble forest tree, it contained such a zone. Having,

however, learnt this indisputable truth, we must admit that, though no branch of
I. Hareourtii has yet been found possessing a secondary xylem, it would be pre-
sumptuous to deny the possibility that, if we could discover its matured stems, as we
have done those of the Arran trees, corresponding results would follow. This conclusion
becomes the more probable when we remember how very few there are, even of the
