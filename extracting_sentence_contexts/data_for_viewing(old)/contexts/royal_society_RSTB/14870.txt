One prominent force that favours base pairing within a
natural duplex DNA is the hydrophobic effect [28,31,32].
While there is little doubt that the hydrophobic effect favours
duplex formation, electrostatic and dispersive forces between
the natural nucleobases are also thought to contribute to
duplex stability [33-36]. Of particular importance are local
interactions between polar moieties of one nucleobase and
polarizable moieties of adjacent nucleobases [37-42]. Because
the product of DNA synthesis is a growing duplex, it is
reasonable to assume that some of the forces that mediate
duplex stability might contribute to selective and efficient
replication, and in fact might be optimized to the extent
that H-bonding functionality might be dispensable. This
idea was of additional interest from the perspective of syn-
thetic biology, which at least in part, aims to develop novel
parts that function within living cells to bestow them with
novel functions. Typically, the novel parts are created from
natural components, but their natural-like qualities could
limit their generality, and as mentioned above, could also
limit their orthogonality. Additionally, the idea that not
only could novel parts function in a cell, but that they also
might function via mechanisms and forces very different
from those that underlie the function of their natural counter-
parts has important implications for our understanding of
