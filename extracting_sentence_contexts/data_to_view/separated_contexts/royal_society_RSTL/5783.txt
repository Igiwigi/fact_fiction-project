We have already considered
(at p. 735, fig. 13) what would be the appearance of several such juxtaposed currents, if
een in a transverse section ; but it should be borne in mind that we cannot look for a
strict analogy in the breadth, average thickness, and degree of compactness in lavas of
ancient and modern cones, unless we are able to compare sections of such cones at
corresponding heights, which is usnally impossible,

Fleaures and arches in ancient lavas. In order to guard against imagining a contrast between older and newer lavas, where
none really exists, we must remember that the steeper the angle at which a current
has cooled, the more parallel in general will be the planes of stratification of the several
scoriaceous and stony layers which compose it. No doubt a great diversity of cha-
racter prevails in this respect in lavas which have congealed on corresponding decli-
vities, but I never met with ridges and furrows of great dimensions where the original
slope exceeded an angle of 20*; and the rare occurrence of flexures on a gigantic scale
in the steeply inclined layas of the Val del Bove, has always appeared to me a fact in
favour of the original steep dip of those lavas. We have already seen (p. 718, fig. 6, and
p- 726, fig. 9, and p. 730) that the surfaces of the lavas of 1689 and 1852 are compara-
tively even and uniform where they have cooled on slopes of 30速, 35速, and 40*; whereas
at points immediately contiguous, where the same currents have overflowed less inclined
planes of 10速 or 15速, they have been bent into gigantic folds and ridges. There may be
exceptions to this rule, for some sharp and conspicuous flexures are visible in the escarp-
ments of the Val del Bove, as for example, near the base of Monte Zoccolaro, in which
there are two arches, one 15 and the other 20 feet high.
