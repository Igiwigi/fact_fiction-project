According to the kinetic theory of gases, fluid pressure is the average result of the
impacts of molecules. If we imagine the molecules magnified until of the size of
meteorites, their impacts will still, on a coarser scale, give a quasi-fluid pressure. I
suggest then that the fluid pressure essential to the nebular hypothesis is, in fact, the
resultant of countless impacts of meteorites. The problems of hydrodynamics could hardly be attacked with success, if we were
forced to start from the beginning and to consider the cannonade of molecules. But
when once satisfied that the kinetic theory will give us a gas, which, in a space
containing some millions of molecules, obeys all the laws of an ideal non-molecular
gas filling all space, we may put the molecules out of sight and treat the gas as a
plenum.
