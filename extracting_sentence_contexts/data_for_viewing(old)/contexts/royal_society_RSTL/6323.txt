that direction is perpendicular to it ; their actual directions will of course vary with the
curvature of the equatorial plane. The horizontal partitions or floors of the chambers
are perforated by rounded apertures (Plate XXI. figs. 2, 3, 4) which closely resemble
those of the shell of a NRotalia or a Planorbuling in their 8ze and arrangement ; and
these will allow of free communication, by pseudopodial threads of sarcode, between the
segments that are lodged in the chambers piled one over the other in a vertical direction.
The vertical partitions are much thicker, and are not thus minutely and regularly per-
forated ; but they exhibit a small and variable number of large
apertures (fig. 4, «, a), that lead into the adjacent cells which lie
in or near the same horizontal plane. TI say # or near, because it
is seldom if ever the case that the horizontal partitions or floors
of two adjacent vertical piles of cells are on the same level ; and,
in fact, the typical arrangement (though frequently departed from)
seems to be, that there is an alternation in the levels of the floors
of adjacent piles (as shown in the accompanying diagram, based on some parts of fig. 3),
and that every chamber in any pile B normally communicates with two chambers in each
of its adjacent piles A and ©, by one passage aboye and the other below the floor that
divides them.

217. The relation of this interesting type of structure to that of Planorbuling appears
to me 80 clear that it can scarcely be questioned. For, as in that genus, the first-formed
portion of Tinoporus lavis will evidently consist of a flattened disk, consisting of nume-
rous segments which are arranged in one plane, spirally in the centre of the disk, but
clustered irregularly towards its circumference, and perforated on both sides with
