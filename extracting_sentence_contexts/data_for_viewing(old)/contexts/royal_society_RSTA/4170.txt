time [3], that continues to be of great interest today in many realms [4-6]. The subject of interest
in this contribution, however, is in regard to a very different aspect of reversibility than the
Loschmidt paradox, which amusingly involves the opposite direction, irreversible to reversible,
and is concerned not with the thermodynamic limit, but rather with the correspondence between
quantum and classical dynamics of strongly chaotic systems. It turns out that the correspondence
principle [7] is deeper and more subtle than the view that unfolds strictly from the assertion that
classical dynamics must emerge from quantum dynamics in some limit, i.e. f — 0 or ‘just replace
commutators with Poisson brackets’. In fact, the reverse connection exists, i.e. semiclassical theory
uses purely classical dynamical information to construct more and more accurate approximations
of quantum dynamics in this very same limit [8].

The reversibility paradox of interest here arises because the properties of classical and
quantum dynamical systems behave so differently, yet are so deeply connected through this :
semiclassical construction. We have in mind simple systems which are strongly chaotic, bounded =
and for which there are no environmental or other degrees of freedom. We also consider only 3
evolution under Hamilton’s or Schrédinger’s equations and do not introduce measurement.
Such systems’ quantum realizations possess unitary dynamics which are inherently reversible. nee)
After all, the inverse dynamics are given by merely taking the Hermitian conjugate of the :
unitary propagators that describe the forward dynamics. In addition, the forward dynamics is a]
stable, because knowing the unitary propagator for some time interval leads only to matrix DN
