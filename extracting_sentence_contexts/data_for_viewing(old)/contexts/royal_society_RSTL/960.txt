dies will be 126, taking Sir H. Davy's number 15, to repre-
sent the proportion in which oxygen unites with bodies.

Mr. Cooyrr states the black oxide of platinum to consist
of 100 platinum, with only 4317 of oxygen;* but he has,
I think, considerably under-rated the oxygen in it. On re-
peating his experiments on a small scale, I obtained results
different from those he has stated. Thus, he says the powder
obtained from the muriate of platinum by a neutral solution
of mercury, is a compound of calomel and the protoxide of
platinum ; but by decomposing this powder in a little retort
over mercury, I found the neck of the retort partially lined
with metallic mercury ; and this fact alone, I think, is suffi-
cient to awaken suspicion as to the accuracy of his results.
Mr. Coors, I presume, used a nitrate of mercury to decom-
pose the muriate of platinum, but he seems to have oyer-
looked the nitrous acid in stating his results.

The chemical history of platinum, is far from being com-
plete. The great want of uniformity in the statements of
