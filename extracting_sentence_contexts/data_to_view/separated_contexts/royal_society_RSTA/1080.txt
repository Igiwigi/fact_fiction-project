The analysis of the simulation data highlights how challenging it is for computations to
resolve the turbulent flow in a fan gap well. However, the final acoustic results directly from the
LBM/VLES and from the two-step method highlight how specific gap flow differences (which
could be from either inaccuracies in the flow simulation or outcomes of the selected analysis
method) may not impact significantly the prediction of broadband noise from the system. Thus,
because the broadband noise is the culmination of a physical averaging of many effects, acoustic
predictions obtained directly from the LBM/VLES method or from the two-step method based
on the LBM/VLES turbulent flow information may in fact be accurate enough to be useful for
engine analysis and design even though seemingly important flow quantities in the gap have been
shown to be inaccurate when compared with experimental data. Finally, if a lower-order two-step
method is used for the broadband noise prediction, this study indicates that RANS based input is
just as good as input obtained from a higher fidelity computational method. Data accessibility.
