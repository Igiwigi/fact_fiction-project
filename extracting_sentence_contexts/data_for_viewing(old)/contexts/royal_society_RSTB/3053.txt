allied genera which, especially in the Radstockian Series and Upper Coal Measures of
the Continent, play an important part both in the number of the species and their
frequency of occurrence. These appear to belong to the Marattiacee.

The Cycadofilices are undoubtedly the oldest group of “ fern-like
which we have fossil evidence. These are succeeded by plants with compound
annulate sporangia and these again by others of a Marattiaceous type. It seems
therefore to be highly improbable that the Cycadofilices could have descended from
plants to which the name of “ fern,” as understood in recent botany, can be applied.
What the progenitors of the Cycadofilices were, for the present remains unknown.

As to the ancestry of the Cycadofilices, 1 believe that they and the Marattiacee
have descended from a common stock and this seems borne out by the fact that
the microsporangia of some of the Cycadofilices—those with a single loculus—
have considerable resemblance to the sporangia of the Marattiacee, for to the

Cycadofilices I would refer such genera as Telangium, Dactylotheca, Urnatopteris,
Sphyropteris and most probably Renaultia, believing that what have been regarded
simply as “ sporangia,” are in reality microsporangia.

There is another most distinct character of Arch@opteris which persists to the
present time amongst the Marattiacea, and that is the stipular appendages at the
base of the petiole (fig. 13).

Such a structure has been observed on Archeopteris hibernica, ForBES sp.,
