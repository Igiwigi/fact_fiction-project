vector. More precisely, C” provided with a dot product is a finite-dimensional Hilbert space.
The Hamiltonian operator is a Hermitian operator (an operator is Hermitian if it is equal to the
complex conjugate of its transpose). The constant ft is a scaling constant (in QPT it has a specific
meaning; in psychological applications it is often just set to 1). The solution of Schrédinger’s


equation is |) = e UMH(2—h) yy, ), where e~@/MH(b-h) = Up,—1, is a unitary operator; unitary
operators have the property that their conjugate transpose is equal to their inverse.

In this model, the overall Hamiltonian was specified in C4, but the structure of this
space was such that a part was separable, in C? @ C2, and a part was not separable (note
that, in physics, it is typically the case that separability concerns C? @ C2, but the structure
of the problem we consider lends itself better to C2 @ C2). In fact, most QPT dynamical
cognitive models are specified so that they have a part which is separable, that is, it can be
written as C2 @ C?, and a part which is not separable, so that it can only be specified in
C*. There is a reason why this is the case: most of the current, interesting empirical findings
which are driving the application of QPT in cognition involve a binary decision. It makes
sense to model binary decisions in a two-dimensional space (such as C?). Also, modelling
in such a separable way retains consistency with the law of total probability, when (binary)

decisions under two conditions are involved. Using the PD example, suppose that there is : =
one Hamiltonian which corresponds to the dynamical evolution of the mental state, given : a
knowledge that the opponent is cooperating, Hc, and another one, given knowledge that 3
the opponent is defecting, Hp. Suppose also that Pp denotes the projector operator for the : XS
measurement of whether the opponent intends to D or not; in QPT, a projector applied onto : _
