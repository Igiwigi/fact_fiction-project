‘Sy k in the results given by plotting the areas, we find that the results are numbers
Svhich are about 105 and 235, and these represent wave-lengths 5570 and 4540
@espectively ; so that, if we observe the total value of light optically, it is
Squivalent to observing monochromatic light of \ 5570, and if we use bromoiodide of
Bilver for registering the intensity it is equivalent to measuring a ray of d 4540.
