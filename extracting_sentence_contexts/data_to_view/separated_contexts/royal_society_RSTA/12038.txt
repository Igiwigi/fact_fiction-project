The columns of temperatures were, immediately after an
experiment, put on a curve with time as abscissze. The effect of radiation to and
from the calorimeter ball is fairly well marked. At the point corresponding to the
temperature of the air in each curve there is an increase of curvature, caused by the
fact that the radiation has changed from negative to positive. Tn order to find the flow of heat, the rise of temperature per minute was read from
the curve at a temperature z° below that of the air, and this was added to the rise
Hr w° above that of the air. «& varied from 0° to 4° or 5°. By this means from ten

fifteen readings were got, and the mean of these gave the rise at the temperature

the air.

2 For example, for the length 6°31 centims. in the first column of Table L, the rise
Bius obtained from the curve, Diagram I, was ‘3605 in one minute.
