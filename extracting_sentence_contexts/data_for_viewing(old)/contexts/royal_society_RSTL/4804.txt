of growth with the same bones in that example; only, in accordance with what has
just been remarked, the cartilage in the centre of each bone has been more or less
absorbed, and only exists permanently as an irregular external ring, separating the
peripheries of the two osseous layers ; being thick at its margin and becoming thinner
as we approach the centre of the bone. The cancelli of the latter portion appear to
have been formed as before.

The dentary bone also exhibits a cylindrical rod of cartilage projecting from its pos-
terior angle, and extending across the inner snrface of the mandible. The vomer and
presphenoid are developed upon the under surface of the interorbital and nasal car-
tilage; only the projecting osseons lamina, contributing to the formation of the inter-
orbital septum (which is almost rendered complete by a thin upward expansion of
the cartilage), is still larger than in the Pike. In fact it may be briefly stated, that,
with one exception, the processes of growth are the same in the Pike and in the
Perch, only modified in the latter fish by the greater extent to which the osseous
tissne has displaced the cartilaginous.

The exception to which I here refer is the vertebra. This bone is wholly osseons.
No cartilaginous segments enter into its composition, and the various apophyses are
firmly anchylosed to the bone. T have not been able to obtain any evidence indicating
that cartilage has ever entered into its structure. It appears probable, that in the tirst
instance an osseous ring has been developed in the membrane surrounding the chorda
dorsalis, and that the sole way in which its subsequent growth has been effected, has
been by peripheral additions of the same kind of bone, variously arranged.
