« and calcareous earth, and also of fluor acid and calcareous
« earth, but without producing in either of them any alteration.
« Since the strong attraction which these acids have for calca-
« reous earth tends to prevent their decomposition, it might be
« thought, that in this manner they were not more disposed' to
« part with. vital air- than by the attraction of charcoal : but
« this, however, does: not appear to be the fact. I have found,
« that phosphorus cannot be obtained by passing marine acid
« through a compound of bones and charcoal when red-hot.
« The attraction, therefore, of phosphorus and lime for vital
« air, exceeds the attraction of charcoal, by a greater force than
« that arising from the attraction of marine acid for lime,” *

By means similar to those employed in attempting the
analysis of the muriatic acid, I tried to effect that of the fluoric
acid, When electrified alone, in a glass tube coated internally
with wax, it sustained a. diminution of bulk, and there remained
a. portion of hydrogenous gas. But, neither in this mode, nor by
submitting it, mixed with carbonated hydrogenous gas, to the
