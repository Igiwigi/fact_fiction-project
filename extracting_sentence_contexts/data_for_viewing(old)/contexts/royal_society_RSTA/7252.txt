energy should be about 60 kcal., which is not in good agreement with experiment.
However, the reaction mechanism is not completely clear, and that it may need modifica-
tion is also suggested by two other facts. First, the addition of hydrogen decreases the
rate of pyrolysis and also decreases the apparent activation energy, the opposite effects to
those expected. Secondly, in several of the experiments, the ratio of methane formed to
aluminium trimethyl consumed was found to be considerably greater than that theoretically
possible on the basis of a dimeric vapour. In consequence, a tetrameric vapour was sug-
gested, but further study by Yeddanapalli & Schubert, as reported in a private communica-
tion to Pitzer & Gutowsky (1946), has shown that the vapour is only dimeric at room
temperature. Since compounds such as Al(CH,)Br are known to exist, the additional
methane may perhaps be accounted for by the formation of Al(CH,) CH,, this subsequently
being measured as unchanged aluminium trimethyl. Possibly relevant to this point is the
fact that Yeddanapalli & Schubert themselves accidentally prepared a new organic com-
pound of aluminium boiling at 49 to 51Â° and more spontaneously inflammable than
aluminium trimethyl. The alternative suggestion that this might be an organic compound
of both aluminium and mercury does not appear to be very satisfactory in view of the fact
that the boiling-point is far below that of mercury dimethyl. Clearly, the pyrolysis of
aluminium trimethyl needs further investigation. In particular, the effect of nitric oxide

on the rate of decomposition would be worth studying, as this might throw light on the
chain process involved, which is still obscure.
