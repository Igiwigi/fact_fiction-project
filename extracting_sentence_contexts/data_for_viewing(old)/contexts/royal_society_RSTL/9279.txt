although themselyes incapable of originating a spasm in rTesponse to stimulation, are
nevertheless 80 wonderfully capable of conducting a spasm when this has been originated
Fi by irritation of the slender tissue-tracts above named. Tt is as though every fibre of
the general contractile tissue were capable of liberating energy in either of two very dif-
ferent ways, and that whenever one part of the general mass is made to liberate its
energy in one of these two ways, all the other parts of the mass do the sxame—and this
no matter how far through the mass the liberating process may have to extend. And
to say that it is the ganglionic element in the margin which, to recur to our previous
metaphor, here acts as a detonator, is not to explain the facts ; for although it would

S be an-interesting thing to know that a ganglion-cell may be able to originate two different
© kinds of impulse according as it liberates its energy spontaneous]y or in answer to direct,
Z stimulation, this knowledge would merely serve to transfer the questions which now
= apply to the marginal and radial tube-tissues in general to the ganglionic tissues in par-
Z ticular. Again, the supposition of the ganglia acting as detonators when themselves
EE) directly irritated, would not explain why it is that the contractile tis8ues are capable of
2 two 8uch yery different kinds of response. Anzwsthetics block spasmodic waves, but not
E till they have suspended spontaneity, and even destroyed muscular irritability as regards
= direct stimulation.
