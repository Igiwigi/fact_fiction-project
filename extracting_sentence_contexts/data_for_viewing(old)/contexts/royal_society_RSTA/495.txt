(a) Overview of the structural changes associated with single-crystal-to-single-crystal
transformations

Selected examples of SC-SC transitions are displayed in table 1 with their respective
crystallographic volume change (z = 1 equivalent). Minimal structural changes are apparently
necessary to allow for SC—SC transitions, and most examples reported show less than 4%
volume change in the lattice volume. The outlier of van Koten and co-workers’ example of SO2
uptake is exceptional because it involves a very large percentage volume change (15.7%), with
expansion predominantly along one axis. However, this occurs in the microcrystalline phase
without loss of crystallinity as measured by powder diffraction, and SC—SC experiments were
not successful. Noteworthy is the 10% change in volume associated with reversible alcohol
addition in the Ag-carboxylates, this perhaps being associated with the fact that this material is a
coordination polymer in the solid state, which might allow for increased flexibility without loss of
crystallinity.

6. Catalysis in the solid state

(a) Heterogeneous organometallic catalysts

The heterogenization of single-site catalysts brings together the benefits of heterogeneous
catalysis (i.e. recyclability and ease of removal from the reaction mixture) with the potential for
intimate control over transformations that occur at the metal centre that is provided by the local
ligand environment in a homogeneous system [15,16]. There are a number of strategies that can be
used to facilitate the heterogenization of well-defined organometallic catalyst systems, including
