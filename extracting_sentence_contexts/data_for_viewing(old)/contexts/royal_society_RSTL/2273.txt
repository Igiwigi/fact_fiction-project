These must be considered in some cases as furnishing a
defence against the attacks of enemies, and in others, as
serving some office connected with the sexual function. In
the present instance, however, these objects are obviously
incompatible with the situation of the gland, and we must
seek for some other use to which the secretion may be applied,
in accordance with this peculiarity.

The predilection of many species of fish for all strongly
odorous substances, is well known to every one who has
observed the habits of this class of animals, and is often made
subservient to the objects of the angler. From the earliest
periods, in fact, at which angling was considered as a sport,
and rules laid down for its successful prosecution, baits were
directed to be imbued with strongly scented oils and extracts,
for the purpose of rendering them more attractive. In a
book printed by Wynkyn de Worde, in 1496, and which is a
republication of the celebrated book of St. Albans, with the
addition of <© The treatyse of Fysshynge wyth an Angle,”
the following direction is given, amongst others, for taking
pike. © Take a frosshe (frog) and put it in asa fetida, and
caste it in the water wyth a corde and a corke, and ye shall
not fayl of hym. And yf ye lyst to have a good sporte,
thenne tye the corde to a gose fote ; and ye shall se gode
halynge whether the gose or the pyke shall have the better.”
