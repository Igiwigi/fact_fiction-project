implement. In the fashioning of an implement having two opposite cutting edges a
change is made from the simple triangular section to one roughly rhomboidal. The
method by which this change was in all probability accomplished has been already
deseribed (p. 337) and a diagram given (fig. 6) in illustration of this description. But
it must be remembered that diagrams are ideal, while the ideal in manipulating a

refractory and peculiar material like flint is seldom attained. Though, therefore, in
the diagram mentioned (fig. 6) the author has shown the second cutting edge at C to
be immediately under the keel at A he does not wish to convey the impression that’
such accuracy was often attained by the ancient flakers of flint. As a matter of fact
the point C may be lecated almost anywhere along the line B—D, and the truth of
this statement will become manifest in the implements now to be described.

6. The Ipswich Transitional Specimen (Plate 56, figs. 1-4).

This Ipswich specimen, though a very early palolithic, river-drift implement,
possessing two cutting edges, presents certain characteristics strongly reminiscent of
the rostro-carinate form. The right and left lateral surfaces (figs. 1 and 2) show a
well-marked beak-like profile, while the massiveness of the posterior region of the
implement is such as is usually seen in rostro-carinate specimens. It is when we turn
to the ventral and dorsal surfaces, however, that the importance and interest of this
Ipswich implement becomes manifest. An examination of the drawing of the ventral
