is the same in both maxillae but in the right side there is a very marked gap in the
middle of the series. The interpretation now suggested is that the real fourth tooth
is missing from the right side, and that the true seventh is present in both maxillae. This is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including
a large number in various museums in South Africa—the fifth tooth is always
relatively large, as in the left side, and is not of the small size of the actual fifth in the
right maxilla. A similar condition may have been present in specimen A. Here
the right maxilla is separate and has been cleaned in palatal view.
