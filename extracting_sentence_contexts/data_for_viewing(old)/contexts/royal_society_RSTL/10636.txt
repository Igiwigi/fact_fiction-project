Experiment 14*,

In this animal the middle temporo-sphenoidal convolution was exposed in its upper
half on both sides, and both were similarly operated on. With the aid of a director
slipped between the dura mater and the cortex, a wire cautery was passed along the
course of each convolution with the view of destroying it and its medullary con-
nexions. This could only be done approximately, and as a matter of fact, as will
be seen from the post-mortem account, the curve of the cortex was not exactly

After the dressing of the wound the animal was awake, the eyes were open, the

Half an hour after the operation the animal when called to opened its eyes and
looked up. When it was sitting quietly afterwards with its head between its knees,
a splashing of water was made, whereupon it looked up and came to the bars of the

As regards hearing therefore there was already satisfactory proof. Tactile sensi-
