(37), it appears by equation (123B) that the maxi-
mum would not be reached until T,,, the rise of temperature due to friction, reached
72* Fahr., which, sceing that at a velocity of 450 revolutions 'T,, is less than 17%, implies
that the maximum carrying power would not be reached until the speed was 1500 or

2000 revolutions; notwithstanding 77 Â© constant is very small ab 450 revolutions,

This is with the rise of temperature due to legitimate friction with perfect lubrica-
tion. Bub if, owing to inequalities of the surfaces, there is excessive friction without
corresponding carrying power, 2.e., if n, the effect of necking, is as large as 3 or 4,
which it is with new brasses, then the maximum carrying power might be reached at
comparatively small velocities ; thus suppose T=13 when N=100 U=21, Equation
(123B) gives

ag=o
or the maximum carrying power would be reached ; all which seems to be in strict
accordance with experience, particularly with new brasses,

42, Application of the Equations to Mr. Tower's Experiments with Brass No. 2 to
determine the Oil Pressure round the Journal. The approximate equation (74) is available to determine the pressure at any part
of the journal, 1.e., for any value of 0 80 long as c is 8mall, but these approximations
fail for much smaller values of c than for others, for this reason, together with the fact
thab the only case in which the pressure has been measured c is large, the pressures
have only been calculated for e='5, in which the approximations have been carried to
the extreme extent. These are obtained directly from equation (107), and the pressures divided by K;c
are given in Table II., Section VI. The results of Mr. Towrr's experiments with brass No. 2 are given in Table XII.,
