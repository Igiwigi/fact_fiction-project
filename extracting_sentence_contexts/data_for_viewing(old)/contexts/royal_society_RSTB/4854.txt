By the Season is meant the whole sequence of weather directly or indirectly influencing
the crop from its inception to the time the produce is weighed. In studying the influence
of the rain on the wheat crop, we have chosen a period of a year ending on the 31st of
August of the year in which the crop was harvested. To obviate the irregularity of the
calendar, this year was taken to be of 366 days, so that it commenced.on either the 31st
of August or the Ist of September prior to the sowing of the seed. â€˜Taking into con-
sideration a single element, namely Rain, only, this sequence is in our climate sufficiently
complex. The general distribution of rain through the year could, indeed, be roughly
represented by dividing the period up into say 6 sections and recording the total rainfall
in each period. If the rainfall were approximately evenly distributed in successive days
or weeks, this method might indeed give a fairly accurate picture of the sequence of
rainfall. But notoriously the rain is in fact often concentrated in short spells, with

rainless periods intervening, consequently if March and April formed one section, a
great part of the rain ascribed to that section might fall early in March in one year, and
late in April in another, and it would be impossible to regard such falls as equivalent

in their effects on the crop. . Whereas a late April fall might well be nearly equivalent
to one occurring early in May.

This consideration suggests that a finer subdivision of the year is necessary ; that
