In the preceding detail of experiments, such only have been
$elected as were attended with marked results. The electrical
'energies of many other substances were examined and com-
pared, but no new facts were ascertained, nor were any
circumstances observed which interfere with the inferences
suggested by the above statement.

To insure accuracy, each of the experiments was severay
times repeated in the presence and with the assistance of some
of my chemical friends, and the results were uniform when
proper precautions were attended to. It is especially neces-
sary to operate in a quiet atmosphere, and to employ a feeble
electrical power, for if the machine is too strongly excited,
the substances under examination are alternately attracted and
repelled between the poles, especially if insulated, or non-con-
ductors of electricity. The balls were usually withdrawn from
