(2) For a spherical shell 200 kiloms. from the Earth’s surface at a temperature of
—66° C.

(3) For a spherical shell 20 kiloms. from the Earth’s surface at a temperature of
—66° C.

(4) For a spherical shell 50 kiloms. from the Earth’s surface at a temperature of
180° C.

Apart from the fact that no account was taken of axial rotation in either my earlier
calculations or those of Mr, Coox, the assumption of the BourzmMann-MAXWELL dis-

tribution prevents us from drawing any hard and fast line between gases which can

exist, and gases which cannot exist, at any given temperature on any planet. It seems
natural to think that, mathematieally speaking, the condition of permanence would
be satisfied if the number of molecules out of which one would attain the critical
velocity were greater than the total number of molecules in the planet’s atmosphere.
But the loss of a good many cubic centimetres of air from our atmosphere in the

course of a year might easily be taking place without producing any perceptible effects
on its practical permanence.
