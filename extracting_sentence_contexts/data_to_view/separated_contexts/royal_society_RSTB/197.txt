Some of the cups are
“= comparatively shallow, while others are both wide and deep; it is possible that the
“8 shallow ones only differ from the others in being less fully developed. One of the
~ most regular and common forms is represented in fig. 3. It will be noted that this
©’ cup is of a considerable size, so large, in fact, that it does not necessarily follow, as
% I originally supposed when studying the organ of R. radiata, that organs made up
= of cups have been arrested in their development. In describing the development of
€ the organ in 2. batis, I mentioned that the discs passed through an indistinct cup
‘ stage, but the cup in 2. batis, instead of becoming deeper, has its margin everted to
8 form, first, a mushroom-shaped structure, and, eventually, a large flat disc. S In R. circularis and others, however, as will be afterwards described, exactly the
§ opposite changes set in; the head of the original muscular club is moulded as it
A increases in size to form a thin-walled cup, from which the posterior part of the
muscular fibre projects in the form of a long or short stem.
