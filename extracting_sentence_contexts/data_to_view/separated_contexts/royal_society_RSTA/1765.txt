The influence of
adhesion on capacitive coupling can be observed as the electric field lines are distorted, thus
altering the inter-electrode capacitance. In the case shown in figure 3b-d, the spherical air void of various sizes is held beneath M1,
placed at the centre of adhesion. They are acting as dielectric resistance to the electric field due
to the fact that permittivity of air is much lower than that of the sample. With larger air void

presented, the field lines are pushed away with darker areas representing higher intensity of the
field. The effects of interlocking, which is modelled as a multi-layer structure, also influence the
distribution of the fringing electric field and thus impact the charge on the sensing electrode.
