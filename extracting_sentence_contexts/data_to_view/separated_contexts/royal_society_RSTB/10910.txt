Microvesicles have been previously of the EV with the endosomal membrane releasing their con-
referred to as ectosomes or oncosomes and range from 100 tents to the cytoplasm of the recipient cell (figure 1) [8]. In
to 1000 nm. They are formed, matured and released by shed- fact, in 2007, Valadi et al. demonstrated that mRNA and
ding from the plasma membrane of the cell (figure 1; left microRNA (miR) could be transferred via EVs from mouse
panel). Both microvesicles and exosomes comprise the to human mast cells. They also showed that the RNA content
accumulation of intracytosolic components although the was functional as they found mouse proteins in the human
protein and lipid composition between both EV subtypes dif- recipient cells [14].
