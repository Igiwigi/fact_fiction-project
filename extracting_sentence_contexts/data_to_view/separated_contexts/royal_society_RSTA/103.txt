In _
the Coulomb-gauge formalism, our gauge condition has eliminated the local gauge invariance; : Sy
it is broken explicitly, not spontaneously. But there remains a global symmetry. We chose ¢ to a

corresponds to the fact that gz may not vanish but be a non-zero constant.) It is this remaining : a
global symmetry that is actually spontaneously broken. Moreover, it should be emphasized that, : Ss
unlike for example the distinct degenerate ground states of a freezing liquid, our distinct vacuum DNS
states are all physically equivalent. This is because for the phase of ¢, unlike the orientation of : =
the crystals, there is no fixed external reference standard.
