In this situation, the transformation of
the suspension in a jammed state can produce a decrease in the rotation speed or even stop it
completely. But, if the motor imposes a ramp of velocity, when the shear rate exceeds the critical
one, we expect a jump in the shear stress which will recover, if it exists, the branch where the shear
rate begins again to increase in the regime of imposed stress. In fact, in the suspensions with an
abrupt jamming transition, the jump of stress above the critical shear rate is very high and well
above the rheometer maximum torque. Furthermore, the stress generated is transmitted radially
and ejects the particles outside the suspension [19]. In a plate-plate geometry, the suspension goes
out of the gap, while in cylindrical Couette geometry, particles are pushed outside the free surface
and air enters the suspension, producing a foam at the surface.
