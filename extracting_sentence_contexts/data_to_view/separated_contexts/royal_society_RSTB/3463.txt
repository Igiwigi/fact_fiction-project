We, therefore, felt at the time
reluctantly compelled to assume that this specimen, although otherwise similar to
those formerly described (D and DD), differed from them markedly in its phase of

development,


OBSERVATIONS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ORNITHORHYNCHUS. 45

The portions of the blastoderm containing the streak and its environment were
removed for sectioning, double-embedded in cedar-oil-celloidin and paraffin, and cut
in series of 10 micron sections. Their examination showed that a primitive knot was
in fact present at some distance from what proved to be the anterior end of the
primitive streak (cf. text-fig. 7) just as we had previously found to be the case in
Specimens D and DD. It was situated pretty close to the cut edge of the
hemispherical segment in which it lay.
