The examination and the analysis of this meteorite had therefore to be performed
on yery minute quantities; in fact on a few grains of debris that had become detached
from the brittle little stone.

The conspicuous ingredient in this meteorite is a pale yellow-green, or primrose-

The granules of green minerals present in the microscope the appearance of tolerably

In separating this green mineral from the fragile mass, I have neyer succeeded in
