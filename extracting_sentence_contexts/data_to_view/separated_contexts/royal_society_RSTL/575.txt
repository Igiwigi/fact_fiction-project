8. That, as carbon, when combined in a certain proportion
with iron, (forming steel,) enables it to become a permanent
magnet, and as a certain proportion of sulphur communicates the
same quality to iron, s0 also were found to be the effects of phos=-
phorus ; for the phosphuret of iron, in this respect, was by much
the most powerful, at least when considered comparatively with
sulphuret of iron,

9, and lastly, that as carbon, sulphur, and phosphorus, pro-
duce, by their union with iron, many chemical effects of much
sIimularity, so do each of them, when combined with that metal
in certain proportions, not only permit it to receive, but also
give it the peculiar power of retaining, the magnetical properties;
and thus, henceforth, in addition to that carburet of iron called
steel, certain sulphurets 'and phosphurets of iron' may be
regarded as bodies peculiarly susceptible of strong magnetical
impregnation. Having thus, for the greater perspicuity, reduced the principal
facts of this Paper into a concise order, I shall now make some
general observations. It is undoubtedly not a little singular, that a substance like
the magnetical pyrites, which, although not common, has been
long known to mineralogists, should not hitherto have been
chemically examined, especially as mineralogical authors have
mentioned the analysis of it as a desideratum, The result of
this which I have attempted, proves that it is really deserving
of notice; for. thus we have ascertained, that the sul phuret of

iron hitherto known only as an artificial product, is also formed
by nature; and that the composition of this last, agrees with those
proportions of the artificial sulphuret which have been stated by
Mr. ProusT.
