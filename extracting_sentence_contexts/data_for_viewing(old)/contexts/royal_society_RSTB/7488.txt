lung volume to interstitial volume will be a measure of the stretch to which elastic fibres are subjected
in the growing lung. A linear relation is found between this ratio and numbers of septa, each of which
contains a bundle of elastic fibres in its free edge. It is this linear relation which suggests a causal
relationship between tension and the structural complexity of lung architecture.

Support for this view in lungs at term and during the early stages of post-natal life is given by the
results of artificial distension. The plan of the 5-day lung, the complexity of whose structure is much
greater than that at term, can be reproduced by artificial distension of the dead lung at term. Hence
there can be no question of any vital processes of growth nor of epithelial activity. Distension alters the

lung architecture by altering fibre tension, especially the tension of elastic fibres. In the living lung,
it is very probable that active contraction of plain muscle in the mouths of alveolar ducts and their
main subdivisions is also involved. The fact that the structural results of respiration and 5 days’
growth in vivo can be so completely reproduced by artificial distension, as it were in vitro, is good reason
to believe that subdivision of the respiratory lumen in both cases depends upon the same factor, the
tension in elastic fibres.

PART 1. ALVEOLAR EPITHELIUM IN THE RABBIT’S LUNG

INTRODUCTION

One of the unsolved problems of lung structure is concerned with the existence of an
epithelium covering the alveoli. Epithelium is a continuous sheet of cells separated from
the underlying tissues by a basement membrane. This criterion is obeyed up to certain
