An only moderate tenacity ratio of from 1-42 to 1-78 in liquid hydrogen is characteristic
of all except one, No. 3754, of the austenitic ferrous alloys in the present research, and
of the metals copper and nickel, which have the same form of atomic structure. The hardness of 1449A (31-4 nickel) at ordinary temperature has increased from 162 to
317. The large increase in its tenacity at the temperature of liquid hydrogen from 43 to
118 tons per square inch, a ratio of 2-76, was to be expected from the fact that it is
permanently transformed, owing toits higher carbon and manganese contents, although
be it noted that the increase is no greater than at liquid air temperature. Class 8a. Iron and Manganese with low Carbon.—With 15-27% manganese in steel
No. 1379D/2, the effect of low temperature in increasing the tenacity is still further
reduced, but the rather low ratio of increase is, as in No, 4147/104, 1-04°%, Mn,
maintained the same, at about 1-2, in liquid hydrogen and in liquid air.
