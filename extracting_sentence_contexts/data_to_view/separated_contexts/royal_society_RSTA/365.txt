We have seen in § 3 that with
increasing FE, they actually first rise above it to give ‘peaks’ and then fall beneath

it. Thus we might anticipate that the band widths would be less than the theoretical
values for metals with one valence electron. This, in fact, seems to be the case. The
good agreement obtained for metals of higher valency means that the effect of those
parts of the N(£) curve above and below the parabola just cancel one another. Tasie 8.
