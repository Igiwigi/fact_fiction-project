just the fit region in three-dimensional space it may completely occupy, without adding
any geometric information on the way the matter is arranged at microscopic scales. Every
point of such a region is intended as the place of what we call a material element, a
conglomeration of atoms, an indistinct mass point endowed just with 3 d.f. in Euclidean
point space.

â€” Such initial choice determines the description of the interactions among distinct parts of
the body and the external environment. Subdivided into bulk and surface actions, they
are defined as elements of the dual space of what describes the rate of change of the body
morphology, as I have already mentioned, and satisfy the balance equations, which may
originate from multiple sources. The investigation of the nature of their origins is essential
for the individuation of reliable paths to determine them when we want to build up new
models. In fact, acting in analogy with well established practice, e.g. the balance equations
pertaining to a single mass point or a rigid body subjected to the action of the external
environment, may be at times just a hope to determine the result. The more we know


about the nature of the interactions on and in a body, the more we can be sure about the
identification of the appropriate balance equations.

Then we furnish information (indirectly in a sense) on the essential aspects of the material
structure through the state functions, the so-called constitutive relations, which link what
we have selected as state variables (another modelling choice) to the interactions within
the body under analysis. Experimental data address the selection but there is certain
arbitrariness in the choice. The second law of thermodynamics and the requirement that
