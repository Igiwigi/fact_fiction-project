If so,
it certainly approaches nearer to what we find in my plant than any other hitherto
described. If so, however, the objects which Mr. Binney designated macrospores,
must be regarded as sporangia, which the rows of similar interbracteal spheres in my
Volkmannia Dawsoni certainly are. Notwithstanding the above facts, this subject would have been left in a very
unsatisfactory position had not Professor Cu. E. Weiss fortunately obtained in
Germany a specimen, which he has named Bowmanites Germanicus.t These
figures correspond so closely with those of Mr. Bowman reproduced in Mr. Bryneyâ€™s
memoir, that the genus Bowmanites can now be accepted as representing an
extremely distinct type of Calamarian fructification, But until my memoir on
B. Dawsoni was published, nothing was known of the internal organisation of this
fruit ;{ and until now, nothing was known of the structure of its vegetative organs.
