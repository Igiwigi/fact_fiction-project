(4, 6x, 8*+2wLj*—20, a*—2w)*=0,
where
4.(8z*+20)—(6a)=—4(a*—2w),
it appears that there are also the three cuspidal conics y*—24%=0, a*—2w=0. Reducing
by means of these two equations, the equation of the second polar is at first obtained in
the form
(4, 6x, 82* + 2wX 3/7 Ay— 6a?An, 2Ar—Auv—adAz)=0;
but further reducing by the same equations and writing for this purpose y=az(s*=2),
the equation becomes
(4, 6z, 92*Y2*(39* Ay —6Amnz), 2rAr—2Aw —wAzY=0,
that is
a[22(39*Ay— 6Az) + 3(2Ar—2Aw—wAz)]=0,
and we have thus the off-points a*=0, y%—22%=0, a*—2w=0, in fact the before-men-
tioned two points each 6 times; and the complete value of 0 is 8=(4+12=)16; viz.
the off-points are the points (@=0, y=0, 2=0), (x=0, y=0, w=0) each 8 times. On
account of this union of points the singularity is really one of a higher order, but equi-
valent to 9=16.

I am not at present able to explain the off-plane or reciprocal singularity 6=1.

33, As to the close-point or singularity x=L.-L remark that at an ordinary point of
the cuspidal curye the section by the tangent plane touches, at the point of contact, the
cuspidal curve: the point of contact is on the curve of section a singular point [in the
nature of a triple point, viz. taking the point of contact as origin, the form of the branch
in the vicinity thereof is 4*—a*=0, where y=0 is the equation of the tangent to the
