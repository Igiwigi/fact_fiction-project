550 yd. (500 m.) south of its junction with the straight new artificial river: it is very
close to the point where the upper roddon silts terminate upstream, and must also be
close to the landward edge of the underlying fen clay. It will be seen that the strati-
graphy shows an upper and a lower peat bed separated by soft fen clay. The latter is
penetrated throughout by Phragmites, a clear indication of its deposition in brackish
or nearly fresh water.

The base of the diagram, from 590 to 625 cm., falls within zone IV. Betula and
Pinus are much the most important trees, but Betula clearly predominates. All the
other warmth-loving trees are present, though not necessarily forming continuous
curves, and it seems probable that the pollen of Alnus and Tilia at least has been blown
from a long distance into a country sparsely populated with trees. This suggestion is
strongly supported by the fact that the curve for the ratio of non-tree pollen to tree

pollen has high values in zone IV, and falls sharply at the transition to zone V. Within
zone IV there is also a continuous Salix pollen curve, a feature consistent with open
conditions.
