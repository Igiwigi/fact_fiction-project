However, the white noise com-
ponent of the mixed clock might also be able to buffer
against the impact of sudden rate shifts, by locally absorbing
the deviation. This could explain the pattern observed here in
Cetartiodactyla, where the white noise component infers high
rates of evolution along several successive branches in the
early part of the phylogeny of the order (figure 4; electronic
supplementary material, figure S6). These high rates esti-
mated by the white noise component would compensate
for the fact that, because of its strong inertia, the Brownian com-
ponent tends to over-extrapolate the low-rate signal
contributed by extant Cetartiodactyla too far up in the tree. In other words, in the presence of sudden rate shifts, the
mixed clock would bring some warranted flexibility, compared
to the pure Brownian clock—although in a way that does not
really correspond to its intended mechanistic meaning. Ultimately, the mixed clock considered here may thus not
represent a correct formalization of the macro-evolutionary pro-
cesses underlying rate variation.
