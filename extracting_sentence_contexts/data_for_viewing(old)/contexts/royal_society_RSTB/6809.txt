centration to form birefringent jellies, are properties shared by the X virus proteins with
those derived from tobacco mosaic and its strains. On the other hand, no crystals or
paracrystals, as Bawden and Pirie prefer to call the needle shaped crystal-like structure
observed in tobaccoâ€™ mosaic preparations, have been secured from X virus infections.
Instead of crystal-like structures an amorphous deposit is obtained on separation and
purification of X juices with acid or ammonium sulphate. The purified product like
that obtained from tobacco mosaic juice is far less readily filtered, and it is suggested
that in the process of purification an aggregation of small particles into chains has
taken place. Characteristic of the X virus product is its extreme isotropy, a feature
present in a lesser degree in the corresponding preparation from tobacco mosaic.

The workers in this new field of plant virus disease investigation have emphasized
the fact that the peculiar protein body they isolate from infected juices (a) represents
almost all the soluble protein present in the juice; (b) that it contains 95% and
over of the total virus present; (c) that both in the case of tobacco plants infected with
mosaic virus and of those infected with the X virus, a given quantity of raw infective
juice in each series always yields an equivalent weight of the protein; (d) that there is
every reason to regard the protein and the virus agent as one and the same.

These conclusions constitute a great advance in our knowledge of viruses and their
importance cannot as yet be fully gauged. One deduction made by the writer several
years back from other and different reasons and referred to on p. 170 would seem to
