In the simplest (incompressible)
case, this leads to the Kolmogorov 4/5th law [81]; with du(r) = u(x + r) — u(x), and with uy the
longitudinal component of the velocity (along 1), it is written as (suz(r)>) = —(4/5)evr. This law
has been generalized to include all components of the velocity, to the dynamics of the passive
scalar and to that of MHD [82] and Hall-MHD [83]. In the helical case, some rewriting of
second- and third-rank tensors taking into account the fact that vorticity and helicity are pseudo
(axial) vectors and scalars, was deemed necessary [15,84]. Vectorial versions of these exact laws
stemming from conservation properties can in fact be derived in a simpler manner [85]. In the
fluid helical case, the exact relationship for helicity reads, with éy the dissipation rate of Hy

For incompressible helical MHD, working on the magnetic induction equation leads to, with
eturb = y x b the electromotive force (EMF) (see [85] for Hall- MHD):

Five remarks are in order. (i) The magnetic helicity law is not in terms of structure functions, 8 |
but of correlations functions, likely because a large-scale magnetic field cannot be eliminated

from the dynamics (and is the source of Alfvén waves), whereas Galilean invariance allows us 3
to ignore the mean velocity field. (ii) These exact helical relationships involve cross-correlations, 1S
e.g. between velocity and vorticity w, or the electromotive force and the magnetic potential. : gS
(iii) In their vectorial form [85], such laws clearly indicate the relationship between the lack of : 3
Beltramisation (non-zero Lamb vector, Lorentz force and Ohm’s Law) and the amount of transfer : =

through scales. (iv) These helical expressions have barely been analysed on data, with the notable
exception of the fluid case for the EDQNM (Eddy Damped Quasi-Normal Markovian) closure
[86], and for a series of DNS [87].
