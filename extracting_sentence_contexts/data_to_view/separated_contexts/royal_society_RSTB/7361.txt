believed that they were present only in fish sperm heads and in the nuclei of avian
erythrocytes and of thymocytes, for it was, in fact, only in these nuclei, or in the tissues
containing them, that they had been found. It has now become recognized as a result
of the present authors’ work in Britain and of that of Mirsky and his collaborators in
America that these basic proteins are much more widespread in their occurrence. They
have been extracted as sulphates from nuclei (Stedman 1944) isolated from various
tissues, including tumours, and in the form of nucleoproteins (Mirsky & Pollister 1942,
1943), or as components of thread-like structures which have been termed ‘chromosomes’
(Mirsky & Ris 1948), obtained directly from a number of tissues.
