is given by w = (x2+y?—a?)?. (B. 14)

The form of (B. 14) shows that an accurate solution can be obtained on any mesh, provided
that all finite-difference formulae used retain differences of orders up to the fourth. This
example should therefore present no difficulty, but it is useful as a demonstration of the
methods and formulae already given.


366 L. FOX ON THE NUMERICAL SOLUTION

Consider the mesh of figure 16, in which one-eighth of the circular plate is shown, with
symmetry about the broken lines. There are four points A, B, Cand D at which the differential
equation is satisfied, two internal fictitious points P and Q, three external fictitious points
L, M and N, and one boundary point S.

Ficure 16

If the radius is taken to be 3 units, the mesh length in figure 16 is one unit, and the finite-
difference form of (B. 13) is given by
20wW,)— 8S, +25,+5,—64+A = 0,) (B.15)
A=—3(88 +68 J+... J
This equation is to be set up at each of the points A, B, C and D, the fictitious points involved
being obtained, and eliminated if necessary, by means of equations (B.11) and (B. 12).
Taking advantage of symmetry and the known (zero) values of w, dw/dx and dw/dy at every
boundary point, the following equations are obtained from (B. 15), with A neglected:
