It would have been far more satisfactory if he had done similar
controls upon equilibrated CO,-bicarbonate mixtures. in which the concentrations

of [CO], and of ((H,CO;] + [HCO,] + [¢ 05) were much more nearly equal than
in the extreme case of carbonic acid solution. Such mixtures would have resembled
much more closely those with which he had to deal in his main experiments and hence
would have given more conclusive controls.

(ii) In his dehydration experiments, Faurnoitr does not mention how he avoided
or controlled the presence of carbonate in his NaHCO, solution, Omission here would
tend to give too low values of hk.

(iii) The boat method of the present paper is a very direct one. and it is hard to
see where it can have gone astray, unless conditions at the gas/liquid interface are
responsible. Against this is the fact that the precise and repeatable results of the
boat method are approximately confirmed by the rougher, but all-fluid, photo-electric
method. Results by the latter are from 10-20 per cent. higher instead of lower than
those by the boat method. We feel therefore for the present inclined to put more
trust in our own numerical values for the velocity constants than in FauRHOLT’s, but
we much hope that in the future it may be possible to analyse the discrepancy more
thoroughly.
