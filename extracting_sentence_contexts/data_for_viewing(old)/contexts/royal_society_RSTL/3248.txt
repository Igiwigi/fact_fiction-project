were accurate, for in seventeen out of nineteen instances in the Rabbit, though the
parts were generally examined while still warm, I was unable to discover Sperma-
tozoa in the fluid collected from the surface of the ovary. In the other two instances,
however, Spermatozoa, or at least animalcules exactly like those I had been accus-
tomed to meet with in the uterus and vagina, were really found on the ovary. I
$hould rather say, that on one of those occasions Spermatozoa were seen, while on
the other it was a single Spermatozoon that was observed. Some of the former were
alive and active, though not in locomotion ; others were dead. In that case, twenty-
four hours post coitum, there was neither enlargement of the Graafian vesicles nor a
high degree of yascularity in any of the parts. In the other instance the single Sper-
matozoon found was dead, and the ova had escaped. Now whether the Spermatozoa
are essential to the impregnating power of the seminal fluid, I do not think it needful
to inquire. The fact that in the course of these researches they have been met with on
the ovary, demonstrates that the seminal fluid sometimes penetrates as far as to the
surface of that organ. Whether it penetrates into its interior I am unable to deter-
mine; but certainly the changes above described, as taking place post coitum, in the
condition of the oyum while still within the ovary, are too remarkable not to favour
the s8upposition that it does}.

146. The changes now more especially referred to will presently be seen. The ger-
minal vesicle ante coitum, after the formation of the yelk has begun, is situated in the
centre of the latter. From that locality it passes to the surface of the yelk, the germinal
spot being situated on the internal surface of the germinal yesicle. The ovum (as
shown on a former occasion, 0. c. par, 85.) is conveyed from the centre to the surface
of the Graafian vesicle, and indeed to that part of the surface which is situated nearest
