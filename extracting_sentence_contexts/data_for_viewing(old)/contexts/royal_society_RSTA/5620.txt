In the subregions where the BU estimates exceed the TD estimates, the CSG sources dominate
CHyg emissions (66% of total CH4 emissions according to the UNSW inventory). This suggests that
the CSG emissions might be slightly overestimated in the UNSW inventory. G&B stations are the
biggest contributor to CSG emissions in the overestimated subregions (subdomains 10_02, 10_03,
15_02,16_04, 18_02, 18_05 and 18_06 electronic supplementary material, figure SF27). However,
the evidence is not unequivocal.

The feedlot cattle are the second largest contributor to emissions in the BU overestimated
subregions (subdomains 12_02 and 15_02), and the UNSW inventory assumes that they operate
at full capacity. Reducing the feedlot cattle population to a percentage of the licenced capacity
would improve the match between BU and TD emission estimates in these subregions. In fact,
removing feedlot emissions from the subregions would in part reduce the need to decrease CSG
emissions in order to match BU and TD estimates. There are two subdomains where piggeries
contribute greater than 20% of the CH4 emissions (15_04 and 15_05); these sources require closer
examination. There are also cases where the CSG water ponds (10_03, 16_04, and 19_01) contribute
greater than 20% of the subregion emissions. In subregion 18_4 coal mining contributed greater
than 20% of emissions, so at this location, the total emission estimate would be sensitive to
changes in the emission estimate for coal.

In the subregions where the TD estimates exceed the BU (BU/TD 0-50%, electronic
supplementary material, figure SF27), there are four subdomains where CSG G&B contribute
greater than 20% of the subregion emissions (16_09, 16_10, 19_03, and 19_04). This highlights
that generalizations about changing emission factors for the CSG G&B stations must be treated
