ROYAL SOCIETY EXPEDITION TO MONTSERRAT, B.W.I. 71

as having reached a state in which it was incapable of initiating great volcanic explosions.
Rocks in which hornblende has been almost entirely resorbed to “black” aggregates are
also regarded as representing magma that had been at too advanced a stage of con-
solidation to initiate major explosive eruptions. It is here further suggested that the
pyroxene-bandaites represent hornblende-bandaite magma in which the amphibole
has been completely, or almost completely, changed to “‘pyroxenic” or to “black”
aggregates (cf. Washington 1896). Chemically they differ little from some of the
hornblende-bandaites, and many contain minute traces of resorbed hornblende. These
hypotheses would account for the facts that, in Montserrat, pumice always contains
green hornblende, that highly glassy rocks more often contain green hornblende than
brown, and that pyroxene-bandaites are very seldom even slightly porous, and never
form pumice.

By those who believe in gravitative differentiation, and possibly even by some sup-
porters of the assimilation hypothesis, the olivine-basalt magma of Montserrat, as
compared with the bandaite magma, may be regarded as having been derived from
a lower part of the main magma reservoir of the Caribbean arc. Like many other
areas, Montserrat provides no decisive evidence on the major problems of differentia-
tion. We do know, however, that the eruption of basaltic lavas and tuffs at South
Soufriére Hill was preceded and followed by purely explosive hornblende-bandaite
eruptions that occurred only a very short distance to the east and to the north.
