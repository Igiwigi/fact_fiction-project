Elephants are capable of gener-
ating infrasonic calls [51] with frequencies below 50 Hz being
possible, and lasting for several seconds [52]. In this case, an
accelerometer would need to record at twice the highest fre-
quency of an elephant’s vocalization range to detect/record
the sound [53], assuming that the ensuing vibration can be
sensed by accelerometers. In fact, by sampling acceleration
at 320 Hz on African elephants Loxodonta africana, we have
detected clear pulsed waveforms at 19Hz, which we
assumed were due to infrasound.

(b) Memory
A key element of biologgers is that they store, rather than
transmit, data [54]. This has power and_ practicality

measured at 5 Hz and resolved at 16 bit, immediately following a single deep
(22 m), long (165 s) dive.
