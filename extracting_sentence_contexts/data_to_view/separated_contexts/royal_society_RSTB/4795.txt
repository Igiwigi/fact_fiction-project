The prediction formule which we have obtained are entirely independent of the slow
changes which appear to have taken place in yield and in weather. In presenting the
evidence for slow changes in yield (5) it was presumed, in the absence of a full investigation
of the sequence of rainfall records, that favourable and unfavourable weather conditions
fluctuated independently from year to year ; in fact, that slow changes were absent from
the meteorological series. We now know that a small percentage of the variance of
annual rainfall should probably be ascribed to slow changes, and that sequences of wet
years did in fact occur about 1879 and 1914. Since these two periods agree with the
two main depressions in yield, it becomes at first sight questionable whether the slow
changes in yield may not after all be ascribable to meteorological effects. *
