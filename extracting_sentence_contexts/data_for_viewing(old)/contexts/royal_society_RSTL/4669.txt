practical considerations snggested by the facts now under notice.

1. Recent researches in meteorology have shown us, that when we confine our
attention to the mean annual and mean diurnal values (of the temperature for example)
in different parts of the globe, we derive but a small part of the instruction which the
observation of nature is eapable of affording. A similar remark applies with equal
justice to the consideration of the variations of the magnetic elements. Jn the Annual
Variation now before us, even a very cursory inspection is sufficient to show, that as
the same months occupy positions on opposite sides of the mean line at different
parts of the twenty-four hours, the mean Annual Variation, or that which is shown by
the mean values in each month taken from al/ the observation hours, must be merely
a residual quantity; and that consequently natural features must be more or less
masked in deductions in which only mean values are brought into view. In fact,
as has been shown in the published volumes of the observations at St. Helena and
Hobarton, the mean annual variation at those stations is 80 small as to be scarcely
sensible, more particularly at Hobarton, where its whole range amounts to not more
than a small fraction of a minute of arc. But when we resolve these mean results
into their respective constituents, viz. the Annual Variation at each of the observa-
tion hours, there is then at once disclosed to us an order of natural phenomena,

well deserving the attention of those who are occupied in the delightful and highly
