But however this

Z are obvious, and they especially concern the question of after-effects. We have not

A facts in spite of the fallacy, and it will be one of the objects of a future paper to find
numerical expression for this vague quantity. Finally we may mention a further pozsible source of error, which however cannot be
eliminated should it exist, viz.: the unequal alteration by the current of the condue-
tivity of the nerve and of the surrounding tiszues. It is conceivable that the conduc-
tivity of the surroundings of nerve should be increased in a greater proportion than
