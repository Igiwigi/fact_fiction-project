As exogenous stems grow, the pith gradually contracts, and what
cells remain do 80 in a final condition that rather represents effete structures than active
cells filled with vigorous protoplasm. Yet, though the medulla becomes thus altered,
and its primary mission a thing of the past, the medullary rays continue to grow and
actively fulfil their exsential functions, which is to maintain free lateral communication
between the inner and outer layers of the wood, and between both these and the bark. If this reasoning is sound, and I believe it to be 80, the fact that a matured Lepidoden-
droid stem has its medullary axis occupied in some cases with barred cells, and in others

even with barred vessels, in no way militates against the conclusion that the vertical
piles of mural cells which separate the laminw of the yessels constituting the woody
zone, and which are constantly extending in a peripheral direction, are true medullary
rays. Their earliest genesis, combined with their final functions, rather than the degree
of differentiation which the several tissues have finally undergone, determine their
nature.

1 shall shortly demonstrate that, simple as these rays are in their early form, they
become very definite when we ascend to some of the higher developments of the ligneous
zone which we shall find amongst these Lepidodendroid plants.
