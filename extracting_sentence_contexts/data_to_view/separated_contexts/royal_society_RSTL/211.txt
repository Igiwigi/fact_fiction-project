But the mere
arsenical smell, was not a sufficient ground to-assert that it con-
tained arsenic acid; for this metal might, with as much proba-
bility, have been in any other state, If indeed, that very accu-
rate and able analyst had, upon trying the ore with the blow-pipe
in a platina spoon, perceived no fumes, 'he might then have
concluded, that the arsenic must be in the tate of acid, and that
charcoal was necessary to operate a partial reduction, to which
the arsenic owed its volatility and its smell. But no.such expe-
riment is reported,

It is alsd rather extraordinary, that Mr, GMELtN should have
taken this ore out of the class of arsenical 'ores, and left it as
an unknown species of copper; when, in fact, it is an arsenical
ore, but not an arsenical ore of copper. ;

I examined some crystals, which are commonly attached to
the specimens of this ore. They were those which, according
to M. Dt Bovuknox, are in a state of decomposition.
