It would, therefore, be more accurate to say that a primordium forms in
each gap as soon as the gap attains both a certain minimum width and a certain minimum
“Jowness,”’ the term “‘ lowness ” being understood to mean distance below the growing-
point. This hypothesis may be more briefly stated by saying that each primordium
arises in the “ first available space,” the word “ available” being understood to mean
both wide enough and “low” enough. Actually matters are simplified by the fact that
in the Lupin, both normally and also, probably, in all the experiments here reported,
the gap that first becomes low enough is also the gap that first becomes both low enough
and wide enough. But it is nevertheless possible that in some other plants, or even in
the Lupin in other circumstances, this may not be so.

(7) The Causes of the Increase in Angle between the next two Primordia. It must next be considered what were the causes of the increase in the angle between
the next two primordia after the isolated primordium, and further, why the increase was
much greater after isolation of I, than of P,.
