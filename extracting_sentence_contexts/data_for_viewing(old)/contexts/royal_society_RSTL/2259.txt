Taz principal object of this Paper is to give an account of a
singular combination of chromic acid, and chlorine, which I dis-
covered about a year and a half ago. But as the investigation
of this compound led me to a more careful examination of the
oxides of chromium, and a more accurate knowledge of their
compoxsition than had been hitherto attained, I shall also tate
the facts which I have ascertained with respect to these bodies.
In a Paper inserted in the Annals of Philosophy ( 15t Series,
vol. 16, p. 321), I have shown that the atomic weight of
chromic acid is 6:5. Two other compounds of chromium
and oxygen being known, namely, the' green oxide, and the
brown ozide, 1 was induced, from analogy, to consider the
atomic weight of the former to be 4:5, and that of the latter
55; and to make the atom of chromium 3:5. These views
were rather favoured by some experiments on the chloride
and muriate of chromium, which I have $tated in my © First
Principles of Chemistry,”* vol. ii. p.' 32. But these experi-
ments deviating more than two per cent from the theoretical
number, could not be considered as decisive. How far my
