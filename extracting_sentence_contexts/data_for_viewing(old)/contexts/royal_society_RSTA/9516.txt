The susceptibility of the crystals did not differ appreciably from that of the liquid.
A control experiment on nitrobenzene gave the abnormally large value 12 per cent.
(which agrees with the earlier experiments with this substance) for oy.

A Comparison of Experimental Results.

The general facts which have been described with regard to the large value of Ox
during the crystallization of aromatic compounds and the relatively small value which
has been obtained in the later experiments for substances of an aliphatic nature form
an interesting parallel with those relating to the magnetic double refraction of
aromatic and aliphatic liquids investigated by MM. Corron and Movton.* The
parallelism is particularly striking with nitrobenzene and hexamethylene. For the
former the induced magnetic double refraction and the value of 0x are abnormally
large while with the latter both effects are inappreciable.t

I propose to give a table showing the values of the percentage change of
susceptibility on crystallization (x/y) and the magnetic double refraction (M), each
referred to nitrobenzene as unit, for a number of substances investigated by Corron
