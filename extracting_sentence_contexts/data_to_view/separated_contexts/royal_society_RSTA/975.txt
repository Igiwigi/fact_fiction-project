Peri-urban development on Ningboâ€™s historic waterways. (Online version in colour.)

This lack of hydrological connectivity between new development areas and their boundary
conditions (surrounding catchments) has emerged as a common area of concern for the
Sponge City initiative. While the national guidelines recommend that flood modelling should
be integrated with catchment-scale flood and water resource models, support from central
government is focused on urban development, such that integration with the larger catchment
planning processes is under-represented. While the public generally supports government investment to reduce flood impacts and risks,
the fact that 19 of the 30 pilot cities have experienced flooding since 2014 [24] is not an encouraging
signal to send to potential investors. Water-logging or flooding has occurred in 10 of the first 16
pilot sponge cities, and 9 of the 14 later pilot cities [25]. These included Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing
and the capital cities of Fuzhou, Wuhan, Jinan and Nanning.
