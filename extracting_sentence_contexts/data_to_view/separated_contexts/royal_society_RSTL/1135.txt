Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. K. B.'P.R.S.-

Read February 25, 1808. Tis facts and rexilts intended to be communicated in this
Paper, are founded upon observations made, during the pre-
sent winter, at the cotton manufactory of Messrs. PuiLies and
Ltzr at'Manchester, where the light obtained by the combus-
tion of the gas from coal is used upon a very large scale; the
apparatus for its production and application having been pre-
pared by me at the works of Messrs. BouLTox, Warr, and Co.
at Soho. The whole of the rooms of this cotton mill, which is, I be-
lieve, the most extensive in the United Kingdom, as well as
its counting-houses and store-rooms, and the adjacent dwelling-
house of Mr. Le, are lighted with the gas from coal. The
total quantity of light used during the hours of burning, has
been ascertained, by a comparison of shadows, to be about
equal to the light which 2500 mould candles of six in the
pound would give; each of the candles, with which the com-
parison was made consuming at the rate of 4-10ths of an ounce
(175 grains) of tallow per hour.
