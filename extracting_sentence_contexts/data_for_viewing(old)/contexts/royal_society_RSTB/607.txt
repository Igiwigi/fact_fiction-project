The subject is one of great importance from a scientific as well as from a clinical
point of view. Some years ago a case occurred in my practice which tended to shake
my faith in the absolute truth of the doctrine of complete and immediate decussation
of sensory impulses in the spinal cord, as taught by Brown-Skquarp.

The experiments which I have performed exhibit the following principal points of
interest :—

1. Return of associated movements after complete destruction of the crossed
pyramidal tract below the lesion.

2. That all sensory impulses do not decussate in the cord; in fact, they appear to
show that certain sensory impulses, e.g., touch, the muscular sense, and localization in
space, pass chiefly up the same side, painful impressions up both sides. A peculiar
condition known as “allochiria” occurs after hemisection. i

3. The vaso-motor disturbances are on the same side as the lesion, and consist of
