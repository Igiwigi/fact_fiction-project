(d) Extension to Uranus

While this paper has focused on Neptune, similar arguments could also be made for Uranus.
The D/H ratios are very similar on Uranus (D/H = 4.4 + 0.4 x 10-5) and Neptune (D/H =4.1 +
0.4 x 1075) [24], suggesting a similar O/H enrichment if Uranus’ interior is fully mixed. The
tropospheric methane abundance on Uranus is also approximately 2-4% [102,103], suggesting
a similar C/H enrichment. Many hydrocarbons have also been observed in Uranus’ atmosphere
[104], but not CS. The main difference in observed atmospheric composition between Uranus
and Neptune that has relevance to the interior structure is the measured CO abundance.
Uranus’ stratospheric CO is approximately 8 + 1 ppb [105], which is much lower abundance than
Neptune’s approximately 1 ppm. CO has not been detected at all in Uranus’ troposphere, with a
30 upper limit of less than 2.1 ppb [31], again much lower than Neptune’s approximately 0.1 ppm.
Therefore, the case for a rock giant is in fact simpler for Uranus as there is no requirement to
dredge up CO from a strongly oxygen enriched interior to explain the tropospheric composition.
The lack of tropospheric CO could then be explained by either: lack of a large cometary impact
in the rock giant case; or by reduced tropospheric convection in the ice giant case, as inferred from
the low emitted infrared flux [78]. The D/H ratio is again the strongest argument in favour of the
rock giant scenario, although as for Neptune, for this to have relevance to the interior requires a
well-mixed fluid envelope [9,24].

4. Conclusion

Current observational constraints from fundamental physical properties are consistent with both
ice and rock giant interpretations of Neptune’s internal structure. Further constraints are available
from observations of the atmosphere, which we consider in this paper, but it is difficult to
