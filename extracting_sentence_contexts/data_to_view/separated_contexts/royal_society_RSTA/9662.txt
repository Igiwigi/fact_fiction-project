To indicate the explanation this is
entered in the table, a difference of 503 making the denominator for D (6) = 6°716653. The observed abnormality as between D,,(6) and D,,—v=D,,(6) is that the wave
number of D,, is 1°26 less than D,,, whereas it should be 8 or 9 greater, with a
denominator about 32d greater instead of 1721 less. There is, in fact, a further
defect beyond the normal value of about 36d. Thus, if the difference for D, (5, 6) is
x6, that of D, (5,6) is (w+386)0d. The lines would then be represented as follows :—

d= 700767, d, = ‘740508,
Dy (6) = (26,) D(©)—N/{6 +d,—(x+36) 5},
D, (m) = (28,) D(%)—N/{(m+d,—28)}*.
