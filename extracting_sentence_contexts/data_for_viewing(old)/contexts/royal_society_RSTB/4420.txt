ton; and one from Kent’s Cavern, Torquay (8-foot level). In the Ipswich Museum
there are three from Suffolk (Warren Hill, Lakenheath, Mildenhall); and one from
Canterbury. Dr. W. Atten Sturer, of Icklingham Hall, also informed the author
that his vast collection contained several examples of this type of implement.

The author has found that the symmetrical river-drift implements with two
eutting edges which still retain the rostro-carinate profile are even more numerous
than the so-called “side-choppers.” The late Sir Joun Evans in his well-known
book “ Ancient Stone Implements of Great Britain,” second edition, figures five such
specimens (Nos. 429, 436, 448, 445p, 458), and the author has seen many others in
public and private collections.

Sir Ray Lanxesrer has drawn the attention of the author to the fact that the
shape of the palolithic implement bears the same relation to the rostro-carinate as
does a flat-fish (plaice) to a dog-fish. The section of a dog-fish and a rostro-carinate
is roughly triangular (fig. 11), while the section of a paleolithic implement and a
flat-fish bear a great resemblance to each other (fig. 12). Sir Ray LanKesrer lays
