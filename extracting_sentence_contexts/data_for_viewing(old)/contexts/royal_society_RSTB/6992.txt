nine chambers), 0-46 mm. (doubtful, six chambers).

Horizon: 1238a.

Remarks: The elongate-ovoid and pointed protoconch is noteworthy; the sutures
are flush, but often thickened; the aperture is plain, not radiate.

The species is referred to Dentalina rather than to Marginulina, since there is no
evidence of coiling in the early chambers, though it is recognized that this is not a
conclusive point. The two genera seem to run together in such species as this.

Terquem’s figure is unsatisfactory since it seems certain that the initial part, which
depicts a globular protoconch with rounded base, is wrongly drawn. It is, in fact,

soit incompléte, et que Vextrémité postérieure manque; la disposition des loges et ’épaisseur des
cloissons fournissent des caractéres suffisants pour la distinguer.

Bartenstein and Brand (p. 160) note the similarity of some of Franke’s species here
put into the synonymy. The form never seems to be common, all the records referring
to it as rare or very rare.
