The rarity of spontaneous exploration also 30
argues against context VI, true curiosity. Additional comparisons among orangutans, chimpanzees Â£ 254
and capuchins [43] strongly suggest that feeding innovations 5 204
often concern the most nutritious and thus most favoured By
food sources. In fact, most of the cognitively more demand- 5 154
ing feeding innovations mainly concern high-quality foods 3 104
[40,43], with few exceptions [47], thus suggesting that opport- 2
