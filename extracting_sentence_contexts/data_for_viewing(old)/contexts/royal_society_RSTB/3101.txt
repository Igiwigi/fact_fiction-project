outgrowths on its upper surface show that the tissue chiefly affected is the palisade
parenchyma (fig. 20).

The formation begins either in the mesophyll alone, or the epidermis may at once
be involved. The epidermal cells, however, never divide, but each swells up into an
isolated papilla. The mesophyll cells rarely divide, but elongate into club-shaped
structures which soon break through the epidermis, which falls off in isolated cells
(fig. 21). Tho elub-shaped mesophyll cells first separate from one another at their
free ends, and ultimately they also fall apart into their constituent elements (figs. 22
and 23). The underlying tissues may also be affected down to, but (as SoRAUER
observed in other cases) not including, the epidermis of the lower side. The lower
epidermis, however, ruptures, and the result is a perforation in the leaf.. The club
shape of the hypertrophied cells is apparently due to the fact that after the cells
have broken through the epidermis, the pressure is removed from their free ends,
which consequently swell, while the lower ends are still pressed upon by one another.
The elongated cells are extremely thin-walled. They contain nuclei with highly
refractive, degenerating nucleoli. They also contain degenerating chloroplasts,
which, on account of the enlargement of the cells which contain them, become
widely separated from one another. There is no oil in these intumescences, oil, as
noted above, being most abundant in outgrowths formed wholly or in part of
epidermal cells. But the fact that the normal course of metabolism has been
