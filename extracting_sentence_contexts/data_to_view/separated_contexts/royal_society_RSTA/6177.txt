Bayesian blinkers

Historically, debates over the relative merits of Bayesian versus non-Bayesian methods have often
been heated. While I like to think that we have gotten over the worst of this, there remain,
undoubtedly, some statisticians with entrenched positions. Furthermore, the fact of the matter
is that we all come to a problem with our own set of tools that we feel comfortable with. Thus,
in some cases Bayesian methods may be used either because of philosophical intransigence, or
simply lack of knowledge or due consideration of possible alternatives. (And, of course, the same
applies to non-Bayesian methods.)

I myself have made extensive use of Bayesian methods, and most of my work has a Bayesian
component. However, I have learned from experience that not all problems need to be tackled in
a Bayesian way.
