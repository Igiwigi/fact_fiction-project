Similar remarks, mutatis mutand:is, apply als in some degree to the Legu-
fie but to the Miscellaneze in a greater degree than to them. S We have throughout spoken of the manurial conditions provided on plot 14 as being,
Smpared with those on plot 16, such as to greatly increase luxuriance relatively ts
Aaturing tendeney of growth. Yet, as a matter of fact, the herbage on plot 14 was

ays much more forward and riper than that on 16. This result, apparently 80
Fomalous, i is in reality by no means 80. The excessive amount of nitrate forced into
Ereat prominence a few very free-growing grasses, and these were characterized by

rly maturity ; whilst the smaller quantity of nibrate favoured a number of grasses

much more sluggish development, and later growth.
