Jwelled and numb, though not absolutely senseless ; he felt a
ightness at the pit of his stomach, and his mouth and lips
Swere parched ; but what distressed him most was cramps in
he muscles of his sides and hips, which were drawn into
Knots. Though immersed in the sea, they were all of them
Sery thirsty ; and though exposed to such severe cold, Mr. ZAMYAT himself was not drowsy, nor were any of the men

= Reflecting on the particulars of this melancholy story, there
Seemed no doubt that the death of the two masters was to be
Amputed to their peculiar position on the wreck. Exposed to
Sheavy showers of sleet and snow, they might suffer from being
gwet with fresh, rather than salt water : they might also suffer
Zfrom being exposed to the cold of the atmosphere, probably
E8even or eight degrees greater than that of the sea. The
Schilling effects of evaporation might operate against them,
2 promoted as these must have been by the high wind ; or they
might receive injury from their frequent immersions in the sea,
producing an alternation in the media surrounding.
