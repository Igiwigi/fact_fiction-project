= It will be seen from the table that, except in the case of aluminium, all the rods of

‘dnetal broke at temperatures a little above the freezing-point. This peculiarity of
Aluminium is due to the fact that the metal has no constant temperature of
Bolidification, but behaves more like a mixture than a pure substance.
2 The apparatus was withdrawn from the furnace as soon as the weight fell, and the
gesidue of the rod was examined. As a rule the rod had completely melted into two
~r three round beads, but the rod of aluminium broke without melting.
= The second method was a pull-out method similar to that employed by Mryer,
Rivpie and Lams in the study of salts (‘ Ber.,’ 1894, Jahrg. 27, p. 3129), and later
“by us (‘Journ. Chem, Soe.,’ 1895, p. 190). A Jena tube of about 5 millims. internal
Spore was sealed at one end and the end slightly enlarged into a bulb. A gramme or
wo of the metal or alloy was then melted in the tube so as to fill the little bulb, and,
Svhile the metal was still liquid, an iron wire was pushed into the metal so that the
nd was immersed. When the metal had solidified, the iron wire became firmly fixed
An the metal, and on account of the bulbous shape of the end of the tube the ingot
