First, we need the ‘lines’ within a PT
(obtained by such means). I cannot go into full details here, but theorems of Kodaira and others
can be invoked to establish the fact that spaces PT, constructed in this way (and not deviating too
far from the initial PP C PT) contain a complex 4-parameter family of ‘lines’ defined solely by the
fact that they are imbedded Riemann spheres, with complex structure inherited from the ambient
PT and belonging to the appropriate topological family, these lines being represented as the points



of the space V. An explicit geometrical procedure involving T’s I-structure then naturally assigns
a complex-Riemannian metric g to V [6,8], where g turns out to be anti-self-dual and Einstein.
(The complex-conformal anti-self-dual metric of V is defined by PT’s complex-manifold structure,
even without 7’s I-structure, simply from the fact that intersecting lines in PT correspond to
null-separated points in V [6,8].)

5. Palatial patching and twistor quantization

We have seen that not only can linearized vacuum general relativity be encompassed in a natural
(albeit somewhat surprising) way by twistor theory, but so also can the nonlinear theory—albeit
restricted, as yet, to the left-helicity case. This provides some encouragement for the twistor
programme, as a means towards describing Nature.
