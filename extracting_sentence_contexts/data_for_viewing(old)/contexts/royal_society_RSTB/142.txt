In Millepora the division of the spermospore into a sperm morula does not take
place, the spermoblasts being formed by the rupture of the spermosphere at a very
late period. It is highly probable that this is due to the same cause as the similar
phenomena in the development of the ovum, and this cause is the wandering or
migration that takes place through narrow channels before they reach their ultimate
position in the zooids.

The Zoological position of Millepora.â€”The very prevalent idea that Millepora and
Hydractinia ave related to one another, must now be abandoned. The skeleton formed
by the former is calcareous, by the latter chitinous, the zooids of Mullepora are very
different in character from the zooids of Hydractinia, and lastly the phenomena of
sexual reproduction in the two genera are totally different. Indeed, beyond the facts
that they are both Hydrozoa with dimorphic zooids and a certain similarity of growth,
there are no points of relationship between them.

I am inclined to believe that the Milleporide, together with the Stylasteride, belong
to a separate stock altogether from the Hydromedusz, a stock which never possessed
meduse or medusiform gonophores, . To this point I purpose to return in a subsequent
Memoir.
