liquid fluoric acid as water combined with the acid.

In the second hypothesis, that which I have alluded to in
the beginning of this paper, and that adopted by M. Ameere,
the silicated fluoric acid is conceived to consist of a peculiar
undecompounded principle, analogous to chlorine and oxy-
gen, united to the basis of silica, or s!/icum; the fluo-boric
acid of the same principle united to boron; and the pure liquid
fluoric acid as this principle united to hydrogen.

In the third hypothesis, which probably would have been
formed by the disciples of the phlogistic school of chemistry,
had they been acquainted with the facts, the liquid fluoric acid
is considered as an undecompounded body ; and the metals
and inflammable bodies as compounds of certain unknown
bases with hydrogen: silicated fluoric acid gas, on this idea,
must be regarded as a compound of the fluoric acid with the
basis of silicum, and fluo-boric acid gas as a compound of
fluoric acid and the basis of boron.

Whoever will consider, with attention, the different facts
that have been brought forward by ScayetLE, Gay Lussac
and TyExARD, Join Davy, and myself, will find that they
will admit of explanation on either of these hypotheses ; and,
as in all the cases yet brought forward, of the most simple
