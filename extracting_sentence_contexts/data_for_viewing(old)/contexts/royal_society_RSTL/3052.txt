Blackwall to observe the relative appearance of the lights when exhibited at

scrutinized, I was glad to learn on returning from Purfleet that, besides the
gentlemen immediately connected with the Trinity House, the experiments
described in Captain Harr's letter had been witnessed by Admiral Sir Taomas

northern light-houses ; by Sir 'Tromas BrIsBanE, Colonel Corpy, Captain Beau-
ForT, Hydrographer to the Admiralty, and seyeral other individuals eminent,

to the liberal spirit evinced by the Trinity Corporation on this occasion, and to
the desire which they have manifested of facilitating, by every means in their
power, the introduction of this method of illumination into light-houses. Indeed
I hesitate not to express my belief that, if this do not take place, it will arise
