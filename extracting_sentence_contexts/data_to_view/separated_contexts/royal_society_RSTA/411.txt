The impact of the stochastic sea ice parametrization on the mean climate of the coupled model
ECHAM6-FESOM turns out to be very different. The mean sea ice volume in the Arctic and
Antarctic remains largely unchanged with the stochastic scheme switched on. In the Arctic, this
can be explained by the fact that in an integrated sense the increase of sea ice thickness north of
Greenland and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago is accompanied by a loss of sea ice in the central
and eastern Arctic. This reflects the increased transport of sea ice from the eastern to the western
Arctic which is also reflected in increased sea ice velocities. The same argument holds for the


Antarctic.
