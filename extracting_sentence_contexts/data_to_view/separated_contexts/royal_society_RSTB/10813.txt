Although
we did not analyse the protein levels of PCC1, accumulation
of Ile in the PCC1 mutant is in agreement with the downregu-
lation of PCC1. PCC1 silencing slowed down BCAA
degradation, but did not result in BCAA accumulation
in cells at day 10, and HIBCH overexpression promoted
BCAA degradations. The phenotypes in these transgenic
strains account for the fact that knockdown of PCC increases
propionyl-CoA oxidation to acrylyl-CoA and eventually
to acetyl-CoA. HIBCH, encoded by a single-copy gene in
P. tricornutum, plays a key role in this oxidation pathway. In
addition, serine, which can be metabolized to the intermediate
of Ile degradation (S)-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate [32], was also
increased by 31% at day 6 in the PCC1 mutant, but decreased
by 23-47% in the two HIBCH overexpression strains (electronic
supplementary material, Data S3).
