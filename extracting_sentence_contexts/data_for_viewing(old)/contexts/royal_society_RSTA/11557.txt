It will be noticed that the value of the positive ionisation increases very rapidly
with the temperature of the wire, though not so rapidly as the negative corpuscular
radiation. The relationship between the two is brought out more clearly when the
results are exhibited graphically as in fig. 9. The continuous curves with points thus x
represent the positive, and the dotted curves with points thus © the negative,
ionisation. ‘The scale of current is different for the different curves. For curves (1)
and (4) the unit is 107” ampére, for (2) and (5) 1 = 107" ampére, and for (3) and (6)
1=107" ampére. The two leaks become equal at about 1230° C., though the
positive is far bigger than the negative at low temperatures.

Although the negative ionisation increases far more rapidly than the positive, both
depend on the temperature in the same general kind of way; in fact, the positive
ionisation, so far as its temperature relations are concerned, obeys the law originally
