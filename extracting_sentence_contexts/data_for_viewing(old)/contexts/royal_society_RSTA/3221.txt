We are now ready to prove theorem 3.1.

Proof of theorem 3.1. Assertion (i) was already observed in (2.5). Assertion (ii) follows from (i)
and lemma 2.11. Assertion (iii) follows from lemma 3.3 and proposition 2.8. Assertion (iv) follows
from lemma 3.4 and the definition of a conjugate point. Finally, (v) follows from (ii)-(iv). a

We conclude this section with the observation that theorem 3.1 can be used to establish
monotonicity of the eigenvalues of H;.

Remark 3.5. Let A,(L) <A2(L) <---<4m(L) <0 denote the non-positive eigenvalues of the
operator H_. As the essential spectrum of Hy, is strictly positive, the eigenvalues behave as the
eigenvalues of a continuous family of finite-dimensional operators parametrized by L (e.g. [29,
§II.5]). A complete proof of this fact is given in [31].

We claim that each A;(L) is a strictly decreasing function of L. Applying theorem 3.1(iii) to the
operator Hy — A;(L), we see that |A3,1| > j. As |A3,,| = Az, is a non-decreasing function of L, we
have |A3,.+45| => j for any 5 > 0, which implies that the first j eigenvalues of H,.5 are less than or
equal to A;(L). In particular, 4;(L + 6) < 4;(L), which shows that 4; is non-increasing. We complete
the proof of the claim by noting that 4; cannot be locally constant, because the conjugate points
are regular, and hence isolated, by lemma 3.4. For an alternative proof, we refer the reader to [31]
where the derivatives dij;/dL are computed in terms of the crossing form.

4. Counting eigenvalues for H via the Maslov index

We now show that theorem 3.1 can be extended to count eigenvalues for problems on the whole
