The main
cause of this problem has been hypothesized to be the domi-
nant ‘single process view’ concentrating forensic science
efforts on risk mitigation of inaccuracy in presenting infor-
mation in court to deter miscarriages of justice rather than
evaluating forensic activity in a broader security framework
[3]. The situation is summarized in figure 1. The problems for trace evidence emerged in fact well before
the NAS report. It could be argued that the roots of the current
problems go back 40 or 50 years when technological develop-
ments started to take precedence over problem-solving
in forensic science. Degradation of the holistic view of trace
evidence has not halted since then.
