communication had been content with results agreeing within about 1 part in 400 ;
greater accuracy was not required for the object in view, 7.e., that of deducing the
osmotic pressure from the vapour pressure, for, in that deduction, they had to assume
that the ratio of the vapour pressures was equal to the ratio of the vapour densities ;
while, on the other hand, the direct osmotic pressure did not seem to be of any
greater accuracy. A study of the conditions seemed to warrant the belief that greater accuracy was
attainable ; indeed, at first sight it would be thought that it is only limited by the
errors of weighing, and in fact the experiments at 0° C. on water and on EtOH came
out satisfactorily close together ; later experiments at higher temperatures belied this
and it was found necessary to investigate the cause of the discrepancies. Before proceeding to describe this investigation it is advisable to give further details
of the apparatus and method, and also enumerate the corrections which have to be
applied. The apparatus consists of five quartz glass vessels, preceded by one (No. 0) which
always contains H,SO, and serves to give a final drying to the entering air.
