The
conclusion is that they are very similar and the differences between their shapes are negligible in
practice. Therefore, we favour super-ellipsoidal holes because the Vigdergauz microstructures have a
very complex parametrization which is not easy to handle numerically. In fact, it is not explicit
and depends on elliptic integrals and requires finding zeros of nonlinear equations. This makes
the super-ellipsoidal hole more convenient in terms of simplicity and computational cost.

(i) Level-set description of Vigdergauz microstructure

Let us first provide a description of the Vigdergauz microstructure through the zero value

of a level-set function. Early work [33] described the Vigdergauz microstructure in terms of i>
the macroscopic strain and volume fraction (and material) parameters.
