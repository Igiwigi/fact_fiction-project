Owing to the time-ordering of the measurement, some constraints will be satisfied in both
classical and quantum models (or in any generalized probability theory, GPT) simply due to
causality. Such constraints correspond to non-signalling constraints [40], but only in one direction,
namely from the future to the past; they are sometimes called arrow of time (AoT) constraints [41].
For instance, for the case of sequences of length three, p(abc|xyz), we have

> p(abe|xyz) = > pabe|xyz'), forall a,beA andall x,y,z,z/EX (4.1)
c c
and
> plabe|xyz) = Y plabelxy’z’), forall ae Aandall x,y,y',z,z'€X. (4.2)
be be

These constraints encode the fact that a future choice of an input, e.g. z or z’, must not influence
previous outputs of the box, e.g. a or b.


Representing the above values as a vector (p(abc|xyz))abexyz, the set of valid correlations will be
defined by a set of linear equalities, i.e. the AoT constraints and the normalization conditions for
fixed inputs, together with linear inequalities, i.e. the positivity of probability. As a consequence,
the set of valid correlations (p(abc|xyz))abcxyz forms a polytope, called the AoT polytope. Its
extremal points have been recently characterized [16,42,43]: they correspond to all possible
deterministic functions of previous outputs and previous and current inputs. The intuition at the
basis of this characterization can be understood as follows. Owing to the AoT conditions, each
correlator can be written as
