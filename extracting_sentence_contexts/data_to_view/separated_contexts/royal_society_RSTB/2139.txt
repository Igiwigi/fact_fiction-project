Of course the alternative is that the pigment found in the intestine is excreted into
it, but the amount of pigment found in the gut is very much greater than can be
accounted for by this hypothesis. Looking now at Professor LANKEsTERâ€™s drawing
(fig. 2, Plate 34 of his paper) one is at once struck by the fact that the pigment occurs
in those parts of the cells which are nearest to the lumen of the intestine. I have myself
prepared several preparations showing this, but I also find Cheetopterin staining the
protoplasm of the epithelial cells and dissolved in oil globules.* That is, we find the

pigment as we should expect to find it if absorbed from the intestine.
