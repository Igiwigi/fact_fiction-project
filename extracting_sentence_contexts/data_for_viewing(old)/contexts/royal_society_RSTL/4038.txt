ACTION OF MAGNETS ON DIAMAGNETIC METALS. 29

specific degree of this power of magnetic action possessed by different bodies, and I
have made very little progress in that part of the subject. Heavy glass stands above
flint-glass, and the latter above plate-glass. Water is beneath all these, and I think
alcohol is below water, and ether below alcohol. The borate of lead is I think as
bigh as heavy glass, if not above it, and phosphorus is probably at the head of all the
substances just named. I yerified the equatorial set of phosphorus between the
poles of a common magnet (2273.).

2285. I was much impressed by the fact that blood was not magnetic (2280.), nor
any of the specimens tried of red muscular fibre of beef or mutton. This was the
more $triking, because, as will be seen hereafter, iron is always.and in almost all
sfates magnetic. But in respect to this point it may be observed, that the ordinary
magnetic property of matter and this new property are in their effects opposed to
each other; and that when this property is strong it may overcome a very slight
degree of ordinary magnetic force, just as also a certain amount of the magnetic
property may oppose and effectually hide the presence of this force (2422.). It is this
circumstance which makes it 80 necessary to be careful in examining the magnetic
condition of the bodies in the first instance (2250.). The following list of a few
substances, which were found slightly magnetic, will illustrate this point :â€”Paper,
sealing-wax, china ink, Berlin porcelain, silkworm-gut, asbestos, fluor-spar, red lead,
vermilion, peroxide of lead, suIphate of zinc, tourmaline, plumbago, shell-lac,
