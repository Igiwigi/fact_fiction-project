The largest oscillation which I have observed under this arrangement was 54%;
the wind was moderate, V being only 16". This is equivalent to a change of tension
=764 grains at the cups, nearly 04 of the entire tension there. I cannot account for
the great irregularities of this friction, but T believe similar facts have been observed
on a large scale in applying Proxy's brake to machinery. The extent and frequency
of the oxcillations do not seem to follow any regular law of V or Â», thongh they
evidently are related to them. (67.)
