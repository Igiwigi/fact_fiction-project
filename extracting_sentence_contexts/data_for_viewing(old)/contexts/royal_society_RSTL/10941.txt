(m) a class U containing all the separated classes.

Each class of the collection (r) may be derived by adding to some class s of the
collection (1 â€”1) a class of (1) nob contained in s.

377. We have apparently as an essential accompaniment of the idea of classes the
notion of the inclusion of one class in another. Inclusion is usually regarded as a
relation between ?1w0 classes. This is not, however, really 80. The notion of inclusion
essentially involves that of a chain of classes with two terminals, viz., a class U which
contains all classes, and a class Z which is contained in all classes, of the chain. In
dealing with a class A we really deal also with the classes U and Z; and in dealing
with two classes A. and B we deal with the four classes A, B, U, Z. When this fact
is recognised, inclusion, as commonly conceived, is seen to be a relation which, as
far as the processes of exact thought are concerned, is accidental ; that which is
essential in it depending upon the places occupied in a system of clagses by two
classes relatively to two others (8c. 388).

378. The classes U and Z are not, apart from accidents, distinguished from any
other classes. The system of which the units are classes is a single one. The reason
why U and Z seem to hold exceptional positions is that when we disenss classes we
consider their positions with reference to U and Z, which, being constantly under
consideration, acquire an accidental importance.

379. There are two distinet 8orts of inclusion, viz., direct and indirect, If @ is
