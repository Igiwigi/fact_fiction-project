terms of brain networks. Does a description of structure—func-
tion relationships in terms of networks allow for a one-to-one
mapping? For instance, a network comprised regions Ry, ...,
R,, is involved in function F (such as ‘executive function’). I
suggest that the attempt to map structure to function in a
one-to-one manner in terms of networks will be fraught with
similar difficulties as the one based on brain regions; the pro-
blem is largely passed along to a higher level. Thus, the idea
of multidimensional profiles can be profitably extended to
networks (figure 1b; [40]).

There are multiple reasons for this complexity even at the
network level, including the fact that brain networks are not
disjoint but overlapping (specific brain regions participate in
multiple brain networks [44]) and dynamic (a region’s network
affiliation evolves in time; [45]). These considerations also imply
that, neuroanatomically, there are no specific brain networks for (b) Using known brain networks to choose
