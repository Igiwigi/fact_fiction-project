nished surface, from partial oxidation. - Hence, in the fore-
going experiments, tae fulminating powders exploded in
some cases, as when placed on an oxidated surface, because
the heat did not call into play any other affinities than those
existing between the elements of the compounds. But the
powder did not explode in other instances; as when-in contact

with a surface of mercury, the affinity of this metal inter-
fered, and it slowly formed amalgams with the metallic part
of the powders. This view of the facts seems to derive
additional evidence from the circumstance, that in cases
when no explosions occurred, the powders remained sta-
tionary, and' gradually acquired a whitish colour from amal-
gamation.

I tried to explode the powder by friction, and did not at
first $ucceed, but on well drying it, and warming the vessels
in which the experiment was. to be made, I was able to
explode'it, both in a Wedgwood and steel mortar. The effect
was feeble, and consisted merely of a few slight cracks. Ful-
minating gold is much more readily exploded in this way.
