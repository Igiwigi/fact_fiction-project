to the external surface of each wedge. Examples of all these methods of growth abound.
If not antagonized, the continuance of this process would have given the peripheral por-
tions of the wedges very different dimensions to those described in the preceding pages.
I have already pointed out that we rarely find a dozen laminee in any one wedge. The
constant intercalation of new secondary medullary rays which took place here, as in living
exogens, produced the result described. We thus see that in many of its minute details,
as well as in its more general aspects, the growth of these stems has been a truly
eXOgenous One.

The bark of one specimen, but which stands alone amongst the number of those that
I have examined, exhibits conditions requiring further elucidation: I am as yet unable
fully to understand its significance, but it is suggestive of additional facts belonging to
the history of Dictyozylon that have not yet been worked out. In this specimen, part
of which is represented by Plate XXVI. fig. 25, we have the exterior of the ligneous zone
at d. Some very slight traces of the parenchymatous layer of the bark are to be seen
investing the woody zone. On the other hand, the prosenchymatous layer (&) is very thick :
this thickness is due to the appearance of a large double vascular bundle, snrrounded
by a considerable mass of parenchyma, which is lodged in the substance of the prosen-
chymatous layer. Two of the vertical prosenchymatous laminee, seen at #, }', have obvi-
ously been pushed aside to make room for the aboye intrusive structure. I have already
mentioned the fact that I have never seen any of the cortical bundles located in the pro-
senchymatous zone of the bark, save in one solitary instance, the latter reference being
to the example now under consideration. The double yascular mass (2) bears 0 striking
a resemblance to these bundles when but partially divided, as to leave little doubt that
