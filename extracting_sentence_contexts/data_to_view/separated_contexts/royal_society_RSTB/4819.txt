To such an argument the reply seems to me to be that
we are not likely to observe the actual occurrence of a viable specific mutation—it is

far too rare an event—unless or until we discover how to stimulate such mutations
artificially. This is in fact the answer already given by Dr. Wrtxis (‘ Age and Area,’
p. 212): “Lord RayzxieH has estimated the period since the Eocene alone, which
covers but a portion of that occupied in the evolution of the higher plants, at 30,000,000
years. But if we suppose one mutation in 50 years to survive, we should get the whole
of the existing 160,000 species of flowering plants in 8,000,000 years, which is only
26 per cent. of that time.”

Let us look at the matter more closely.
