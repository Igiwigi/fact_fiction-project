Additionally, socio-cognitive performance in persons without
neuroanatomical damage has been previously shown to corre-
late with functional connectivity between the right cerebellum
and left temporo-parietal regions [27], mirroring the laterality
of our results. The present study supports these findings,
while showing that functional cerebellar networks are also
relevant for processing social concepts in naturalistic texts. In fact, CA patients exhibited no significant associations
between social text outcomes and cerebellar connectivity. Abnormal cerebello-cortical coupling has been proposed to
underlie social cognition impairments in spino-CA [35] and

In HCs, social text outcomes were positively associated with
functional connectivity (i) between the cerebellar culmen
(seed 2) and the left superior temporal gyrus, middle tem-
poral gyrus, temporal pole and postcentral gyrus and
(ii) between the cerebellar tonsil (seed 3) and the left superior
temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, insula and putamen
(figure 1d, top row; electronic supplementary material, S7,
table S4). No significant associations were found for the
non-social text in HCs or for either text in CA patients
(figure 1d, bottom row).
