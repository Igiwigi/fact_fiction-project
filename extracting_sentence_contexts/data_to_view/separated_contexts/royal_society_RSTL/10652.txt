This corresponds to the effects shown in fig. 36 for the cycles of load
from 0-3-0 up to 0-9-0. Now it would seem, from the fact that when 1 kilo. only is applied and removed on
gives rise and off gives fall of magnetism, that there is essentially a maximum of
magnetisation in this annealed wire corresponding to a very small load, and this view
is confirmed by curves taken with vibration, for in these a maximum appears ab or
near 1 kilo. of load.
