This partitioning allows for the
projection of (4.5) onto an n + 1-dimensional Dirichlet distribution. Making use of (3.9), we can
specify F? directly as a random p-box

n+1 n+1

i=1 i=1

with (Win41} ~ Dir[1,...,1] and {x(1),n)} being the ordered dataset {xj.,,}, augmented by x(q) = x,
and x(n41) = XR. The fact that the robust posterior distribution F? can be expressed in this simple manner has
significant implications. Equation (5.12) provides an intuitive understanding of the method that
has been developed. The interval | is partitioned into n +1 closed intervals with boundaries
at the observed points {x;}'!_,.
