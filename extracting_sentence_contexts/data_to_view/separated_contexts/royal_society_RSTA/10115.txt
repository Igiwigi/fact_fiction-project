Now Table VIIL, or fig. 9,
shows that, for amorphous silver of normal specific gravity (u = 1), nx/d is least for
the more refrangible rays. Again, Table IX., or fig. 11, shows that, for » = 1, M, is
greatest for the same rays. It follows therefore, from equation (23) above, that, on
both these accounts, the light transmitted by silver leaf should be blue; and, in fact,
silver leaf transmits.a deep blue light. The approximately equal values of the
reflecting power, Ry, shown in Table IX., or fig. 13, for » = 1, correspond to the
almost colourless reflection from polished normal silver. Consider now the colour changes which, according to figs. 8 to 18, deduced from
the calculations of § 10, should accompany a diminution in the density of gold and
silver films from its normal value (4 = 1) to zero (u = 0).
