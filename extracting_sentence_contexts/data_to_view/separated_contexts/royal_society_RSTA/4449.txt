The difference between the

two rates appears larger in Table XXX. than in Table XXIX.; this is mainly due,
however, to experiment No. 59, and very probably arises from the fact that the time
interval between this and the previous experiment was shorter than the average. Taking the figures as they stand, we should conclude that the mean reading at
21 inches was lowered by only â€˜02 of an inch when the time of reducing the pressure
was increased from 45 to 90 minutes. At first sight, the smallness of this difference
seems truly remarkable, because after lowering the pressure to 21 inches at the
normal rate we should, in accordance with Tables IX.
