In all the Mammalia examined by myself, I have
found the quantity of the white substance of the chord absolutely greater in the
cervical region than elsewhere. It cannot therefore be, as stated by VOLKMANN, in
direct proportion to the grey substance, since the latter is far more abundant in the
lumbar enlargement. Again, his opinion that all, or nearly all the spinal nerves
terminate in the grey substance of the chord, is refuted by the fact, shown by both
K61tKeR and myself, that at least a great number of them do really pass out of the
grey substance as longitudinal fibres of the white columns. But on the other hand,

I cannot agree with the statement of K6rrixeR, that all these fibres continue the
same course within these columns in the direction of the brain; for it is certain, as I
have already observed, that many of them not only pursue a descending course, but.
that others which actually ascend re-enter the grey substance to form loops.
