density discontinuity. Whether or not such currents are possible depends on the nature of
the discontinuity. If, as Bernal has suggested, the density change arises from a rearrange-
ment of the crystal structure, it is possible that such convection could take place, but the
liberation and absorption of heat during this process would disturb the temperature distri-
bution and so change the form of the convection. At present, therefore, there is no theory
which accounts satisfactorily for the observed facts. The widespread fields of positive
anomalies indicate excess mass, but whether this is supported by the static strength of the
crust or by a dynamical process, such as convection currents, is still an open question. The
latter hypothesis appears to be the more attractive, since the assumption of a semi-plastic
substratum provides a simple explanation of the fact that the sediments which form the
outer margin of the continental shelf are very nearly in isostatic equilibrium. The evidence
for this will be considered in the next section.

4:32. Ailantic section (stations 4 to 16 and 50)

This profile comprises stations nos. 4 to 16 and 50 and extends a distance of some 500
miles west-south-west from the Lizard. The results are shown diagrammatically in figure 7.
Profile a gives the free air, Bouguer and Hayford anomalies. It is clear from these that the
