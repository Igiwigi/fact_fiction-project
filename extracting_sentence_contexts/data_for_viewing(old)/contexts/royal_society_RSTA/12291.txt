% To obtain the curve representing the second term on the right-hand side of equation
10), the ordinates of the curve on fig. 14 were multiplied by 1491-7, and then the
Zourve was re-drawn to the same scale as the curve representing 2587°4 (¢ — 12) w(¢).
he ordinates of the two curves were then subtracted from one another, and a curve,
having for its ordinates the difference of the ordinates of the last two curves, was
arawn, which gives the values of d®t/dz® for any value of t. This curve is seen
gn fig. 15 (Plate 15), it is parabolic in shape, cuts the axis along which temperature is
Sreckoned at t equals 315° C., and has its vertex approximately in the line along which
EvPt/dac i is reckoned.
F A similar investigation was made for the same wire for a current of 0°6 ampere, : and
eit was found that the curve for d*¢/dx? in this case cut the axis of temperature at
360° 8C.
E The fact that d*t/da*® is nought at a particular temperature tells us, of course,
E mathematically nothing about the actual value of dt/dx, but from our general know-
Aledge of temperature curves, we know that when a current is passing through a fine
wire, as in our experiments, the temperature will rise rapidly along the wire in the
neighbourhood of the supports, then rise more slowly, and at no great distance from
the supports the temperature curve will become nearly flat, and will be absolutely flat
over the middle portion of the wire.

We are, therefore, justified in assuming that d?¢/dx* and dt/dx are nought at about
the same point of the wire.

On examining the numbers in Table V., which refer to the 6-mil wire, it will he
