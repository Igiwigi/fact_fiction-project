However this may be, the
development of the eggs of insects sufficiently proves that eggs composed of seyeral
ovarian cells, like those which are unicellular, generally are incapable of deyelopment
without impregnation. But no one can deny the name of true eggs to the ova of
Butterflies, &c. ; and we cannot, therefore, class as © false eggs” those which arise from
more than one cell. Perhaps it would be better to distinguish the two classes as ©* com»
pound” and © simple ” or © unicellular.” The names we may adopt are, however, of less
importance than the establishment of the fact that throughout the Annulosa there are
two sorts of eggs, which are of an essentially different structure, and cannot, therefore,
strictly speaking, be regarded as homologous with one another. ;

It is also worthy of notice that among the Articulata 'a few species possess two
sorts of eggs. The cases are indeed few; but as they are also far between (Lacinularia,
&c. among the Rotatoria, Daphnia, &c. among the Crustacea, and Aphis, Coccus, &e,
among the Insects), we may perhaps see in them the last vestiges of a state of things
which at a former period may have been general, or at least more common. It is true
that the existence of two sorts of eggs is generally supposed to be connected with the
presence of Agamogenesis; but this mode of generation may perhaps have had the effect
of retaining a previously existing condition, rather than of originating a new and pecus
liar state of things.
