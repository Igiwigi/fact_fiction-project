the best expansion plans for such scenarios. On the other hand, cost increases as high as 8.2%
can be experienced if the planner adopts a deterministic solution and a different from forecasted
scenario is realized. Moreover, table 5 also shows that the stochastic solution outperforms all
deterministic solutions in terms of the expected total cost, with considerable improvement factors
ranging between 3.7% and 1.1%.

Interestingly, although the stochastic model constrains the final volume of wind capacity
connected in scenarios 3 and 4, it is possible to demonstrate that, overall, this is better than
building a line that ends up stranded in scenarios 1 and 2. In fact, a sensitivity analysis where we
force the stochastic model to commission a new transmission line in epoch 2 (shown in table 6)
reveals that costs under scenarios 1 and 2 escalate with respect to those observed under the truly
stochastic solution and this cannot be compensated for by the cost reduction under scenarios 3
and 4. Furthermore, the early investment ina transmission line is not only economically inefficient
but also prevents the utilization of smart grid technologies (FACTS/QB and battery plant) that
have been displaced by the line.


Table 6. Results from the risk-neutral stochastic model with forced commissioning of conventional network infrastructure:
expansion plan per epoch and scenario, costs per scenario and expected costs (W, S, /'23, B and QB mean investments in wind
power generation, solar power generation, line, battery and quad-booster transformer, respectively, and the additional capacity
in MW is indicated within ()). Note that the results follow the scenario tree structure depicted in figure 3.
