1892. If that be true of lead, it must be true of all the metals which, with this sul-
phuretted electrolyte, give circles producing currents; and this would include bismuth,
copper, antimony, silyer, cadmium, zinc, tin, &c. &. With other electrolytic fluids
iron and nickel would be included, and even gold, platinum, palladium ; in fact all the
bodies that can be made to yield in any way active voltaic circuits. Then is it pos

-8ible that this can be true, and yet not a single combination of this extensive class of
bodies be producible that can give the current without chemical action (1867.), con-
sidered not as a result, but as a known and pre-existing force ?

1893. I will endeayour to avoid further statement of the arguments, but think my-
