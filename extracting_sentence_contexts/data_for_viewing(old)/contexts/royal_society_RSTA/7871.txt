neglected. Presently we shall show that for a right-circular cylinder (u, v, w)
should be taken as

u= x (1 — 6 cos tz) —_y8 sin tz,

v = y (1 — 6 cos tz) + x8 sin cz,

= Oe

where 8 is a function of r = (x* + _y?)! only, and « is a constant. These reduce to
the values given by Samnt-VENANT if we take 8 = 1 and «= 0. But on calculation,
after using the values of the strain components given by (1), we find that the body-stress
equations are not satisfied if we take Satnt-VENANT’s values. In fact, we get

Since we have assumed the strain to be finite we cannot use SAINT-VENANT’S values
