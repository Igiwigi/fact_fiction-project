The orientation, however, shows some degree of regularity in the basal part
of the sorus. It will be remembered that in Gleichenia dichotoma the sporangia
occupying the middle of the sorus show no regularity of orientation, while in those
nearer its base it is constant, as we now see it in Cyathea. The cells which form the oblique annulus become enlarged early, and are partly
derived from the cap-cell, partly from the lower lateral segments ; in fact, the origin
of the annulus appears to be as in the Hymenophyllacez (see Pranti, ‘ Hymeno-
phyllaceze,’ p. 40). The appearance of a peripheral face in a young sporangium, as seen from without,
is shown in fig. 83; the complete ring surrounds an area of the wall (“Platte”),
smaller than that in Gleichenia, but comparable in position (see fig.
