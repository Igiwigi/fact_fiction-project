The pressure is, however, in only a very small proportion of cases, long maintained
at its lowest, even when the return to or towards the normal is slow. A slight upward
tendency is recorded within a comparatively few seconds of the time at which the
minimum was reached. . In the first administration of amyl nitrite this maintenance of minimal depression is
particularly short ; it is, in fact, no sooner touched than in from 5 to 8 seconds the rise
commences. A more prolonged depression at the lowest point, or within two or thre
millims, of it, is observable when the nitrite has been given repeatedly, and this 18
especially the case when the administrations succeed one another rapidly. This pol

and the relatively long depression at or about the minimum will be tanta
later on.

The rise of pressure may vary in speed even when the dose of nitrite remains equal.
