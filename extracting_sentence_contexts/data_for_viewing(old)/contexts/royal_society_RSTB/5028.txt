102 MESSRS, R. B. THOMSON AND H. B. SIFTON ON

specialized rooteap of the Angiosperms with its own initial cells, the calyptrogen. This
structure has apparently come into being by a process of evolution whose stages are
retained in lower living vascular plants. In the Gymnosperms, the periblem, dermatogen
and calyptrogen are not mapped out in distinct regions as in the Angiosperms. The
condition in Lycopods is still more primitive, while in horsetails and typical lepto-
sporangiate ferns, a single, conical cell, of the same type in both stem and root, is
responsible for the growth of all the primary tissues, the apical cell of the root producing
from its basal region cells to form a protective covering of limited extent. Indeed, in
some species* of Platycerium and Asplenium the apical cell of the root is so undifferentiated
that it may form a stem when necessity arises. The plasticity of the root is further
emphasized by the fact that the higher forms, under changed cecological conditions,
may lose the rootcap, as in Lemna, where “ root-pockets ”’ take its place, and in Cuscuta,
with its ephemeral root system,

In view of such facts, it is not unreasonable to enquire whether even the retention
of centripetal primary xylem and the lack of a definite pith in most roots may not be
due to special conditions under which this organ grows and functions. To penetrate
soil, a solid core is advantageous, and from this viewpoint the centripetal growth of
the primary wood, often meeting in the centre and eliminating the pith, is a decided
advantage. Moreover. the functioning root is subjected chiefly to pulling stresses, and
the hollow cylinder evolved in stems standing erect in the air where lateral strain must
be overcome is a non-essential to the perfect functioning of the underground organ.
