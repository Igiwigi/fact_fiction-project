But in the neighbourhood of the mouth, the vertebrae A,—A;
show a modification; the embracing ridges on the posterior surface are greatly
strengthened and continued to the upper limit of the articulation, while at the same
time the median groove on the anterior face, separating
the two ridges, is not so wide or deep. Here we have a
suggestion of the process by which the condition of
procoely in the upper region of the vertebra in Ony-
chaster may well have been converted into the opistho-
coelous condition characteristic of the corresponding
region of the Zygophiurid ossicle. Dertace and Hirovarp (3) speak as follows of the
unpaired dorsal prominence and the unpaired ventral
socket of the anterior or proximal face of the Zygo-
phiurid ossicle :—‘ Cette fossette et cette téte sont
formées en réalité de deux demi-fossettes et deux demi-
tétes rapprochées, condition nécessitée par le fait que la
vertebre est formée de la soudure de deux pitces symétri-
ques.” It does not, of course, follow that the “demi-
tétes” were at one time separated by an interval, and
were, in fact, a pair of prominences, though this may
have been the case. In Ophioderma egertont from the
Lias the two “demi-tétes” are clearly recognisable Text-ric. 5.—Horizontal Sec-
(Plate 9, fig. 3). In this connection, Acrura squamosa tions through a Mextebra of
Pic. from the Trias proved to be of remarkable and peer deters Ea $0 show

the nature of the joint and in
unexpected interest.
