EVOLUTION OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN OF FISHES. 209

Secondly, there can be no doubt that the dorsal and ventral inverted pyramidal
cartilages in the fossil Ganoids indicate an up- and down-growing tendency, and that
this same feature is repeated in the growing pyramidal masses of skeletogenous cells
produced by the embryonic sklerotomes as described in embryonic Elasmobranchs and
in the young of Amia. ‘The principle concerning the formation of vertebral centrum-
forming belts is the same in the recent and in the fossil Ganoids. Caturus has
remained at, or reached, a stage which in Amiéa occurs in the embryonic and early
life only. Another illustration of the repetition of early phylogenetic conditions by
embryonic phases of recent descendants, is the fact that the ‘‘ Hypocentral semi-ring ”

a is frequently double, «.e., it retains the original right and left ventralia without their
a fusing across below the chorda.
