TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY ON XENOPSYLLA 615

In calculating the average theoretical threshold, I rejected certain figures which were
judged to be aberrant.

The recently hatched larvae of X. astia (table 13) failed to grow at 13째 C even with an
optimum humidity of 90 %, though they ingested a little food. The capacity ofsome of them to
live for a very long time indicates that their developmental threshold is about 13째 C; this
is borne out by the fact that their theoretical threshold of development is calculated to be
13-1째 C (table 21). In contrast, similar larvae of X. cheopis and X. brasiliensis (table 13)
grew at 13째 C; in both the species a very few of the larvae that completed their larval life
pupated at 90% r.H., and two larvae of X. cheopis even spun flimsy cocoons after 58 and 65
days. The growth, however, did not produce adults; the main obstacle was the failure of pupal
emergence. The fact that the larvae of X. cheopis lived for a longer time at each humidity
than those of X. brasiliensis and that a higher proportion of them completed their active
larval life at 80 or 90% R.u. (both differences being highly significant) denotes that the
former species is less adversely affected by this temperature. On the other hand, at 90 or
100% R.H. the larvae of X. brasiliensis completed their active larval life in a highly signi-
ficantly shorter period than those of X. cheopis; consequently, the developmental threshold
of the larva of the former species can only be a little lower than that of the latter; this is
corroborated by the theoretical threshold of development, which is lower in
