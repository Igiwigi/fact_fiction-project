From the beginning of
the Protozota series to maturity the mandible is a cutting blade, with no trace of a
palpus, and the number of its denticles gradually increases with age. The metastoma. The manner in which the metastoma originates in the Nauplins as a pair of buds
smilar to those which become the maxille, as well as the fact that it persists in
closely-allied forms as a pair of limb-like structures, seems to show, as CLAUS has


94 MR. W. K. BROOKS ON LUCIFER:

pointed out (* Untersuchungen,‚Äù &e., p. 15), thab the Decapod metastora is morpho-
logically a pair of appendages ; that it has been formed by the simplification and union
of structures homologous with the limbs; and that this pair of appendages was originally
farnished with a body-somite and a pair of ganglia. Cr.avs's reason for the homology
is the resemblance between the Decapod Protozo#4 and the larva of Phyllopods and
Copepods, and the manner in which these parts are developed in the Nauplit of Lucifer
and Euphansia seems to be an additional reason for accepting his view. The firs maxilla.
