slowly, and part not given off at all, even in a vacuum

If an old wire which has been heated in hydrogen for a long time is heated in air,
and then again to a very high temperature (above 1600° C.) in hydrogen, the leak is
nearly the same in hydrogen as in air. On reducing the temperature the leak
remains small for a time, but then begins to increase rapidly and after a time gets to
about the usual value for a wire in hydrogen, At first, while the leak is increasing
with the time, it falls when the temperature is raised. After further heating
the leak becomes more steady, and then always rises with the temperature. These
facts seem to show that an old wire does not absorb hydrogen above a certain
temperature, or only does so very slowly.

The fact that while the leak is rising with time it falls on raising the temperature
is difficult to explain. This effect was obtained on several separate occasions. The
leak, then, has a definite maximum value at a certain temperature. The leak in these
experiments was saturated, so that the decrease on raising the temperature was not
due to a diminution in the velocity of the ions. The leak rose when the temperature
was diminished. In one experiment the current was 107’ ampere at 1300° C.,
4x 1077 at 1400° C., and 4x 10-* at 1500° C.

An increase in the leak while heating in hydrogen at constant temperature is
usually accompanied by a small fall in the pressure, showing that the wire has
absorbed hydrogen. Much weight cannot be given to observations showing a small
change in the pressure, because small quantities of gas may be evolved or absorbed by
the glass or the electrodes, so that a small change in the pressure is not necessarily
