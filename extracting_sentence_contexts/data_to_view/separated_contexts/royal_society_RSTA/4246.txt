This is due to two reasons: these kinds of signals are in general non-stationary,
and the standard transformations often use bases that are determined a priori. Both limitations
are overcome by the use of the MIF method as a post-processing technique. In fact, the MIF
technique can handle a non-stationary signal and does not require any a priori assumption or
knowledge of it, as confirmed in this example by the shape of the plume and its boundary after
MIF post-processing (figure 2b). Regarding the results obtained via MEEMD we point out that, even if the results are
comparable with that produced with the proposed method, this approach has disadvantages.

First of all it is still an open problem to prove the convergence of this technique even in one
dimension.
