also infer from the condition of the discharged Graafian vesicles or incipient corpora
latea, whereabouts the ova lie. I have already stated that all the ova are discharged
from the ovary at abont the same time. They are, therefore, in most instances found
very near together while in the Fallopian tube ; $0 that if a single ovum be obtained, it
may be presumed that the rest are not far off. The Table (par. 319.) shows that I have
often found ova at the commencement of the uterus, that is within an inch or half an
inch of the Fallopian tube. They seem stationary in that locality for some time.

The size of the minute Ovum no criterion of the degree of its development.

167. The figures in Plates VI. and VII. illustrating © &ages,” I have thought it
proper to draw on fixed scales, scrupulously copying nature in regard to size. If
however, these figures be referred to, the not uninteresting fact will be made evident,
that there is no fixed relation between the size of the entire ovum, and the degree
of development of its most essential parts. An extraordinary instance of this is
afforded in Plate VII. fig. 124. where in an oyum of less than 4” the embryo had attained
a stage far beyond what is usual in ova many times as large (par. 218.). On the other
band, Plate VI. fig. 110. presents an instance in which development (as compared
for example with that of the oyum fig. 113.) appeared to have been retarded.

168. Nor do any two parts of the ovum necessarily keep pace with one another ; a
fact well shown in Plate VII. fig. 124., where the incipient umbilical vesicle (bb7) and
the structure am. are very far behind the embryo in the degree of their development.

169. In the following description therefore of successive stages, it will not in ge-
