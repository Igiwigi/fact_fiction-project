already been shown to be highly probable by other considerations, the chief of which
are:—(1) The constancy of the positive ionisation in oxygen with long-continued
heating, (2) the agreement between different wires, (3) the fact that heating a wire
in hydrogen seemed to produce a permanent decrease, and not an increase, when the
steady ionisation it produced in oxygen was measured subsequently.

The above experiments show that the steady positive ionisation produced by hot
platinum in different gases, so far as its variation with temperature is concerned,
obeys a formula first deduced by the writer* and shown to represent the negative
corpuscular ionisation from hot platinum. That this would be the case was rendered
highly probable by the fact established by the writer} some time ago that the
temperature relations of the positive ionisation, when it is changing with time, were
adequately expressed by the formula C = Aé#e~°”, A and Q being constants. The
only theoretical conclusion which this temperature relation seems to warrant is that
the liberation of an ion occurs when the dynamical system from which it is produced
acquires a certain amount of energy, which is furnished, it may be indirectly, by the
energy of thermal agitation of surrounding systems. It does not really afford any
evidence as to whether the production of ions is, or is not, accompanied by chemical
action.

It is interesting to compare the values of Q, which represent, on the assumption
that equilibrium is possible, the amount of energy in calories associated with the
production of 1 gramme equivalent of ions. The numbers which were obtained are
