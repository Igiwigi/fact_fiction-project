S ofasecond, After a sufficient number of repetitions to secure accuracy, a drawing
3 was made of the configuration thus revealed, and when one stage had been
& sufficiently studied, the observer passed on to a later stage. Since, however, each
3 drawing was made from a separate, though similar splash, it was not possible to
3 obtain accurate information about those details which were at once too minute to be
5 seized in such single, momentary glimpses, and too unstable to be capable of exact
5 reproduction in another splash.

Pp A photograph, which can be studied at leisure, is under such circumstances

indefinitely more valuable than a drawing, and produces that confidence in one’s
knowledge of the facts without which speculation as to the causes can hardly proceed.
But, at the date when the observations were made, photographic plates, sufficiently
sensitive to respond to such extremely short exposures were not obtainable, and my
efforts to secure photographs were unsuccessful, A year and a half ago, encouraged
by Professor Boys’s success in the photography of flying bullets, I returned to the
attempt, being also so fortunate as to obtain the co-operation of my colleague at
