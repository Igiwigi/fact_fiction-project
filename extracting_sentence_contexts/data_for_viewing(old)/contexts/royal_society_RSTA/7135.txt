We thus see that both for symmetric and asymmetric loading the theory for the flange
resting on a semi-infinite plate may be applied with sufficient accuracy to the beam of
finite depth, and since any type of flange loading can be obtained by suitable combination
of these two solutions, we can write quite generally, for the outer fibre stress in the loaded
flange at the loading section due to a load W applied to one flange of a beam,

Wb (

8. FULL ANALYSIS APPLIED TO A NUMERICAL EXAMPLE

It will be remembered that in deriving the fact that beam depth, A, has little effect on
outer-fibre stress, we made use of the simplifying assumption a = 0, A, = 00. It is proposed
now to investigate an example in which aand A, have finite values, to check that the semi-
infinite plate solution is still a good approximation to that for the practical beam. The
analysis is developed quite generally, but numerical application is limited to the under-
carriage girder of figure 2.
