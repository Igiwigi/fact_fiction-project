In spite of a probability little short of certainty, some doubt still
remained ; for it could be brought forward, that in the first place the results had been
obtained by means of an extremely powerful reagent, with whose action we were by
no means intimately acquainted ; and, secondly, that we had no such examples of the
general perforation of the pit-membrane by protoplasmic threads. And even allowing
that the pit-membrane was traversed by fine threads, the great question that required
answering was—Do these threads in reality cross the middle lamella, or is it only a
case of the membrane itself being pitted, and the threads running up to the lamella,
but no further ? In order, therefore, to put my results on as firm a basis as possible, it was necessary
to experiment with my methods upon any such cases as might exist, where the passage
of protoplasmic threads through the cell-wall was a confirmed fact, or to endeayour to
establish, in a manner which admitted of no doubt, other instances of the existence of
s1milar phenomena. The first and most obvious examples of the occurrence of the perforation of the cell-
wall are naturally afforded by sieve-tubes, and, in consequence, I began by investi-
gating the results produced upon such structures by the reagents which I had

employed in the case of pulvini. PROTOPLASM THROUGH THE WALLS OF VEGETABLE CELLS. 839

In this direction I found that the method was in every way peculiarly adapted to
show the intimate structure of sjeve-tubes.
