most extraordinary manner, following all the contortions of the string of facts (1874.
1956. 1992. 2006. 2063.), and yet never showing a case of the production of a current
by contact alone, i, e, unaccompanied by chemical action.

2015, On the other hand, how simply does the chemical theory of excitement of
the current represent the facts: as far as we can yet follow them they go hand in
hand. Without chemical action, no current ; with the changes of chemical action,
changes of current ; whilst the influence of the strongest cases of contact, as of silyer
and tin (1997.) with each other, pass for nothing in the resnlt. In further con-
firmation, the exciting power does not rise, but fall, by the contact of the bodies pro-
duced, as the chemical actions producing these decay or are exhausted ; the conse-
quent result being well seen in the effect of the investing fluids produced (1918.
1953. 1966.).

2016. Thus, as Ds La Rivs has said, any list of metals in their order should be
constructed in reference to the exciting fluid selected, Further, a zero point should
be expressed in the series; for as the electromotive power may be either at the anode
or cathode (2040. 2052.), or jointly at both, that substance (if there be one) which is
