A determi-
nation of its vapour-density gave the number 2:9, Pure acetic ether requires 3-04. When acetic ether thus prepared is placed in contact with sodium it becomes hot,
and a considerable quantity of gas is evolyed, which, after being passed first through
alcohol and then through water, burns with a non-luminous flame, and the products of
combustion do not produce the slightest turbidity on agitation with baryta-water. In

. fact the gas is pure hydrogen. When the action is complete, the liquid solidifies on
cooling to a mass resembling yellow beeswax. By putting the sodium- into the acetic
ether as just described, it is difficult to conduct the operation to completion, owing to
the liquid gradually assuming such a thick and pasty condition as to prevent the further
action of the sodium.
