A few years ago Mr. W. B. Tex6eTMBIER pointed out to me a singular property of the
red feathers of the bird called the Touracon, or Plantain-eater. These feathers yield
up a part of their colouring-matter to pure water, a beautiful rose-coloured solution
being thus obtained. Mr. TE6ETMEIER'S attention had been drawn to this fact, and he
at once perceived that it was worthy of fuller investigation than it had already received. On further inquiry, I find that Mr. Warp of Wigmore Street had noticed the evan-
escence and solubility of the red tint in question many years ago, and that other ob-
servers, within the last few years, have even sncceeded in staining pieces of paper with
the red s0lution which these feathers yield. In order that it may be seen what was the
position of the inquiry when I commenced in 1866 my experiments on this subject, I may
cite the authority of some private letters which have been placed at my disposal through
the courtesy of Mr. HuGy Owgx.
