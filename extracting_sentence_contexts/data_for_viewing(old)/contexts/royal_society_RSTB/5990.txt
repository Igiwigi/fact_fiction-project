together, as they are constitutionally the same. In these limbs, according to
BorRADAILE (1926, p. 119), “ there is no gnathobase but an elongate lobe which starts
at some distance from the base of the limb, bears the long fine fringe, and appears to
represent the second to fourth endites.” Again, I do not accept this view, but consider,
on the contrary, that the greater part of the long fringe of setee—if not all—represents
the gnathobase itself.

In a median view of the third trunk limb of Daphnia, close above the bases of the
fringe of filter setee and well towards the posterior end, is a ridge, which looks like a
tubercle, carrying a short slightly curved seta. This ridge can only be seen in an
undisturbed preparation. On flattening the limb under a cover-slip the seta can be
found only with difficulty and then it appears merely as one of the group of spines with
which the endite series terminates; in fact, it is so inconspicuous that LintgEBoRG
omitted it from his figure of the undisturbed limb. A similar spine can be seen in
Simocephalus. It represents the posterior spine of the claw-bearing ridge of the
gnathobase and that this is so can again be seen from the more primitive form Moina.

In Moina these parts of the third and fourth trunk limbs, certainly in the case of the
fourth limb, look like gnathobases as they are not very much larger than the gnathobase
of the second limb and they have comparatively few sete and not the enormous number
as in the case of Daphnia. But in place of the small isolated spine of Daphnia, the
third trunk limb of Moina bears a long spine curving backwards which is proportionately
as long as the posteriorly directed spine on the gnathobase of Sida. I take this spine
to be a land-mark indicating the hinder end of the gnathobase.
