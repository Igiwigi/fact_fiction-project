But this
is restrictive and does not fit well with cases where the different nodes in a given information
set could be widely separated from one another in space or time. In such cases, it may be more
appropriate to think of distinct but perfectly correlated signals operating at different nodes within
the same information set. In fact, other assumptions on signals are possible that still preserve the
indistinguishability of nodes in an information set. In particular, the signals could be i.i.d., but,
more generally, we can require them to be exchangeable.> Figure 2 depicts an information set in
some tree. Figure 3a is the simple case where one coin is tossed at this information set and the
choices can be pegged on the outcome of the toss.
