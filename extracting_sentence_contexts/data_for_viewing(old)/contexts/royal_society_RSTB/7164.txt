the latter. The parasite larva then spins a cocoon within that of the host, and it is at this
point that a state of diapause occurs in a number of individuals. The full-grown parasite larva
remains as such within its cocoon for several months, even though conditions are favourable
for further development. Then, as with those individuals developing without the inter-
vention of diapause, a prepupa and pupa are formed followed by the emergence of the
adult parasite.

In these experiments freshly emerged females were mated with males several days old
(mating was not always successful as is shown by the fact that a few of the females produced
only male progeny). These females were then kept individually in small cages, 44 x 44 x 24 in.,
which were of wood with cheese cloth back and sides and a sliding celluloid front. No
variations in temperature were made, all being kept at 75Â° F, but, since apparently very
little feeding on the host occurs, the diet of the adult females was varied. Some females
were supplied with a lump of cane-sugar, others with cane-sugar and raisin, and others
with raisin alone. All were given, in addition, a dish containing cotton-wool soaked in
water and a pad of dental cotton dipped in honey-water (50 % honey, 50 % water). In
view of the effect seen with Spalangia of varying the temperature during the development of
the eggs within the parent female it was thought possible that varying the diet of the parent
female Cryptus might alter the proportions of eggs producing larvae that go into diapause.

The effect of the two factors, ageing of the parent female and variations in her diet, on
