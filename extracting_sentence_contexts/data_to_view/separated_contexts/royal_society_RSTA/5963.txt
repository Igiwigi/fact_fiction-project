Figure 8 refers to a biaxial stress path inclined
at 30° with respect to the horizontal axis and an incremental deformation L = 0.866025 e; ® e2 +
0.5e2 @ e1. It is worth noting that the zero-energy mode for uniaxial tension (figure 7b) highlights the
peculiar interplay, occurring at the instability threshold, between the local deformation of the
unit cell and the macroscopic deformation. In fact the bifurcation mode shows the sliders within
each cell opening vertically while enabling an overall horizontal macroscopic shearing. Note also
