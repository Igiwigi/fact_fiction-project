him as the result of the breaking up of an originally continuous layer of vesicles brought
about by the disproportionate growth of the blood-vessels around which the thyroid
is laid down.

In Lophius this lobular arrangement, although fairly definite in some parts, is not
everywhere equally distinct, at least so far as the masses of larger vesicles are concerned ;
but in the case of the smaller ones, which are apparently in process of formation and
growth, a definite arrangement in separate linear groups is very clearly marked. The
smallest form, in fact, long series of closely apposed but separate vesicles arranged in
rows like chaplets of beads, which in many places are replaced by, or are continuous with,
long, narrow and sometimes slightly tortuous tubes that gradually taper to a solid
point.

Many of these rows of small vesicles and tubes lie in close apposition to masses of larger
vesicles, and are evidently buds given off from them, as was described by Maurer
(10, p. 146) in the development of the thyroid rudiment in the trout ; but in other areas
(Plate 1, fig. 6) they are the only type of vesicle present and occur as isolated simple or
branching vesiculated strands lying freely in the connective-tissue stroma, and suggest
foci of new growth which, starting as a solid column of epithelial cells, develop progres-
sively into hollow tubes and rows of vesicles (Plate 2, fig. 7). There can, however, be
no question that these strands of growing vesicles, although now isolated, must have
