period just before the fibres break up when they become much more transparent,
and the nuclei may be seen in their interior clustered together irregularly, and in
absolute contact ; this fact, that the nuclei are in actual contact, is a most important
one, for it proves very conelusively that they do not occupy the interior of cells. T

figured in books of a muscular fibre as a string of nucleated cells; on the contrary,
the nuclei, when they approach each other, are free cytoblasts, and they may he clearly

formation of muscular fibre than are the blood-cells.
