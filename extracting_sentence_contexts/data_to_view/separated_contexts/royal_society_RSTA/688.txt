Writing with Leopold
Infeld, Albert Einstein explained how thinking had evolved in their book The Evolution of Physics:
The Growth of Ideas From Early Concepts to Relativity and Quanta:

In nearly every detective novel since the admirable stories of Conan Doyle there comes a
time when the investigator has collected all the facts he needs for at least some phase of his
problem. These facts often seem quite strange, incoherent, and wholly unrelated. The great
detective, however, realizes that no further investigation is needed at the moment, and that
only pure thinking will lead to a correlation of the facts collected. So he plays his violin, or
lounges in his armchair enjoying a pipe, when suddenly, by Jove, he has it! Not only does
he have an explanation for the clues at hand but he knows that certain other events must
have happened.
