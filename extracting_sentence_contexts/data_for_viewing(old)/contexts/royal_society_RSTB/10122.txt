Figure 5. Visual comparison of data types: Tohoku University 3D specimens from CT and semi-3D half-hulls extracted using the run3dmorph software on stacked
microscopic images. Three examples specimens are shown: Trilobatus sacculifer, Truncorotalia truncatulinoides and Neogloboquadrina dutertrei. The Tohoku University
specimens were digitized using X-ray CT at 5 jum resolution. Run3dmorph-extracted 3D-meshes are shown next to their corresponding focused 2D-image.
