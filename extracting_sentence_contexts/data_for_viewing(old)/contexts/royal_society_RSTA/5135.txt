development has taken place to use X-rays to study ‘real’ and soft surfaces: liquids, electrolytes,
polymers and membranes, for example. The beamline has been built to exploit both opportunities
and in recent years industrial use of the beamline has also increased.

Table 6 gives a succinct summary of the wide range of beamlines needed to satisfy the
requirements of this scientific community. The need for the initial three surface and interface
beamlines was very clear and in some sense they filled an obvious gap. However, the final four
are innovative and take the UK into entirely new directions.

Perhaps the most bold and creative idea for a Phase II beamline is encapsulated in the surface
and interface analysis beamline, 109, where it was proposed to let both hard and soft X-rays
impinge at the same point on a sample. This has involved building hard and soft X-ray beamlines
side by side—in fact, they are intertwined so that, when fully optimized, there will be three
endstations: one soft, one hard and one combined. The combined energy endstation is complete
and already producing spectacular results. The concept of the 109 beamline is already being copied
at other facilities.

From the early days of SR, the provision of tunable and polarized light has been seen as an
invaluable tool for the study of the band structure of solids. High-resolution ARPES is now one


of the most powerful tools available for the study of the exotic materials created by condensed | |
matter physics. Inelastic X-ray scattering is an emergent complementary technique that has been

proved by the Swiss Light Source to have enormous promise. In view of these, a strategic decision “3
