However, each of our analyses is of high quality, sufficient to pass peer review as |
demonstrated by comparing our duloxetine-sertraline-stroke example to a published study and R
our prior publications using similar designs. Similarly, our evaluation using control hypotheses .
provides further confidence in the quality of our designs and goes above and beyond the recent
tentative calls to include negative controls in observational studies [39,40]. In fact, we believe unfettered freedom to customize a study for any research question is one
of the main causes of the lack of reproducibility of observational study results, leading us to
the situation portrayed in figure 5a. Our challenge to the scientific community is to point out
changes to our study design that researchers believe to be necessary when answering a particular
question. Such changes should be evaluated objectively on their merit, for example, using control
hypotheses, and if proven to indeed improve quality, can be incorporated in a systematic way in
the overall study design.
