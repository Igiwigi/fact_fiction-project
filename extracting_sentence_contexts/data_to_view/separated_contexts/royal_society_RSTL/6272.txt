Such being the conditions necessary for the mncrease of light, it is
Scarcely necessary to add that the reversal of these conditions, viz. the decrease in the
Dumber of particles of carbon existing in the flame at a given time, imperfect combus-
Fon allowing the escape of unconsumed carbon, and decrease of temperature in the
Fame, determine a diminished Iuminosity.
&g One of the first causes which naturally suggests itself to account for the diminution
Bf light by decreased atmospheric pressure, is the diminished amount, of oxygen in a
iven bulk of the supporting medium rendering combustion imperfect, and thus either
Sausing particles of carbon to escape unconsumed, or determining their conversion into
Earbonic oxide instead of carbonic acid. The effect of the first would be to diminish the
Faminosity, whilst the second would have the effect of decreasing the light indirectly by
diminishing the temperature of the flame. A careful inspection of a gas- or candle-flame,
burning in an atmosphere undergoing gradual rarefaction, does not afford the slightest
evidence of smoke, or even of an increased tendency to throw off fuliginous matter; on
the contrary, the tendency to smoke obviously diminishes as the rarefaction progresses ;
Whilst, on the other hand, the fact that an increase of pressure beyond that of the atmo-
sphere causes the most smokeless flames to. become smoky, renders utterly untenable
the assumption that the escape of unconsumed carbon is one of the causes of diminished
luminosity in _rarefied atmospheres. Whether or not there is imperfect combustion in
