With regard to the nitrogen, it is remarkable that, with the enormous amount, of
about 200 lbs. of ammonia, corresponding to about 164 Ibs. of nitrogen, applied per
acre per annum, for 80 many years, there was, 80 far as can be judged, as large if nob
a larger proportion of that supplied taken up by the growing herbage as where only
half the quantity was employed. There was, in fact, a proportionally much greater
increase in the assimilation of nitrogen than in the amount of total growth—that is,
produce of hay—by doubling the application. In other words, the percentage of
nitrogen in the produce was very much increased. It was, indeed, very abnormally
high ; and, as already pointed out, such a condition indicates a deficient assimilation of
other constituents in proportion to the nitrogen taken up.
