The Floquet theorem allows for expanding these fields in a discrete set of orthogonal
p,q indexed FWs with wavevectors at the nodes of the reciprocal (spectral) lattice, ie. at kpg =
k; + (22 p/d)x + (21q/d)¥, (p,q =0, +1, £2,...). We define the average tangential (transverse to z)

field on the MTS as
E|_ 1 i” ie er(0',ks) | jp’

According to this definition, the average field in equation (3.1) coincides with the coefficient of the
dominant, zero-indexed FW. In fact, the conjugate phase factor in the integrand makes a projection
of the total field on the dominant FW. The electric and magnetic average fields at z = 0* are related
through the tensor impedance Z(w, k;) as

Et|z=0+ = Z(w, ky) - [z x He]z=0+- (3.2)
