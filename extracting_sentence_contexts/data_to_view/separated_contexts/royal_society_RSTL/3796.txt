These experiments seem to lead to the conclusion that the seat of volition is solely
in the supra-cesophageal ganglia or brain of these animals, since all direction of pur-
pose, all avoidance of danger, all control over the movements of the body, either of
speed or change of direction, are lost when these are much injured or removed. Vo-
lition ceases quickly when they are severely wounded, and is greatly diminished even
when one only is slightly affected. This latter fact is indicated by the loss or diminu-
tion of purpose, and by the gyratory movements of the body. The experiments 8eem
also to show that sensation may remain after the injury or removal of one lobe of the
brain, as was proved by the retraction of the antenna when slightly touched on the un-
injured side of the head, and by the cleansing and excited act of drawing it constantly
through the mandibles; and further, that pain is felt when the cerebral lobes are in-
jured, as when the needle was applied to them after the antennz had been removed. They lead also to the conclusion, that all the phenomena which occur in the posterior
parts of the body after the brain and cord have been separated are reflex or excited,
and that these are most intense at the two extremities of the cord—the medulla oblon-
gata, and the terminal ganglion ; and further, that the reflex phenomena are always
excited and do not occur spontaneously, and that their intensity is greater in propor-
tion to the stimulus applied, and gradually diminishes until they entirely cease. or
are re-excited, precisely as already shown by Dr.
