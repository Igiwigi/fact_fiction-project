It should be noted that animals
show osteological features of reptiles, they must have had a which reach full skeletal maturity before the onset of sexual
reptilian physiology, and therefore, their wings and their maturity, such as nearly all living birds and small mammals,
hollow skeletons were ‘merely adaptive’ for flight. Seeley may not follow these curves exactly.

taxa slow and eventually cease growing at some point.
