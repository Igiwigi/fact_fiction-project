It is shown that the components of the velocity can be expressed in terms of X and
differential coefficients of X, and that the current function is also known.

Tn the case of a fluid, part of which is moving rotationally and part irrotationally,
the boundary surface separating the rotationally moving fluid from that which is
moving irrotationally contains the same vortex lines, and may be taken at the surface
X=0.

Now, if the integral taken of the equation in X do actually correspond to a cage of
fluid motion in which part of the fluid is moving rotationally and part irrotationally,
the most obvious way to find the irrotational motion will be to find its current function
from the conditions supplied by the fact that the components of the velociby are con-
tinuous at the surface \=0. Examples I. and III. of this paper have been solved in
this manner.

If after taking any integral of the equation in A ib be found theoretically impossible
to determine the current function of an irrotational motion outside the gurface \=0,
which shall be continuous with the rotational motion inside it, then the integral in
question does not correspond to such a case of fluid motion,

In this method no assumption is made as to the distribution of the vortex lines (as
in the method of HeLMymorTz) before commencing the determination of the irrotational
motion.
