as ever, thus showing that the straightness of the slip-bands, which is so closely

associated with softness and ductility, is a characteristic of the metal rather than a
function of the temperature. In order to thoroughly test the same question in rela-
tion to annealing, a long series of experiments to determine whether or not gradual
re-crystallisation goes on in strained iron at ordinary temperatures and a similar series
on lead at much lower temperatures would be required. In the case of glass-hard
steels it is well known that a certain amount of annealing takes place at 100°C., and
even at atmospheric temperatures ; but in the case of steel, where a distinct chemical
change is involved, the nature of the annealing action may differ very considerably
from that in an approximately pure metal. Certain phenomena in the recovery of
elasticity after over-strain in both iron and steel (Murr, J., ‘ Recovery of Iron and
Steel from Over-strain,” ‘ Phil. Trans.,’ 1899) also point to the fact that changes of
internal structure may occur in iron at very moderate temperatures ; further evidence
in the same direction is afforded by the effect produced (Roger, 8S. R., ‘Proc. Roy.
Soc.,’ 1898) on the magnetic properties of soft iron by roasting at moderate tempera-

tures. On the other hand, it has been very widely believed that annealing or
re-crystallisation, particularly in iron and steel, are “critical” phenomena which can
only occur at or above certain definite temperatures. ARNoLD has gone so far as to
make a careful determination of such an “ annealing point.” Various of the “ arrest-
points” in the cooling of iron and steel have also been regarded as representing
