One story captures Anne Theo’s spirit and personality best. On her first work

Author for correspondence: dive in the Lakshadweep Islands, Anne got separated from her group. Her
Kartik Shanker fellow researchers and I surfaced after the mandatory search and became
e-mail: kshanker@iisc.ac.in increasingly worried as there was no sign of her. The sea was getting choppy

and we were running out of options. Anne surfaced seconds later, about
10 m away, looked at us and said ‘Where were you guys?’ Anne was never
lost, the rest of the world was.

Anne had not considered in-water research when she began her PhD at the
Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. In fact, she was not even a particularly
good swimmer at the time. But once the project was conceived, she trained
herself rapidly in the Institute’s swimming pool and got her dive
certification as well. However, a larger problem loomed. Many marine biol-
ogists she consulted were not enthusiastic about her plan to study mixed
species groups (MSGs) in reefs—they thought that reef fish MSGs were too
ephemeral and might not be interesting. Anne was undeterred—she spent
her first field season in the Lakshadweep Islands gathering evidence that
MSGs were common, could be video-graphed and that there were a host of
interesting ecological questions that one could address about them. Her
work, which emphasized fundamental ecological and behavioural differences
between shoaling and attendant fish groups, would inform theoretical frame-
works that were developed for a global review.
