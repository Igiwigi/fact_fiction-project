Thus, the contour is horizontal in the vicinity of these points. Note
that, owing to TF discretization, zeros of the spectrogram cannot be exactly determined; therefore
a contour, in practice, passes in the vicinity of the discrete minimum but not necessarily exactly
through it. Another interesting aspect of the proposed method lies in the fact that the contour does not
necessarily last for the whole time span of the signal: if the energy becomes locally too small the
ridge ends on the nearby zeros of the STFT. This last point is very important because it indicates
that a mode dies when it connects with a zero. Usually, the presence or otherwise of a mode is
assessed in terms of the statistics of the spectrogram of the noise.
