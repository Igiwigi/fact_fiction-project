and since the redundant product can assume the appearance derived from the matrix

we find that the enumeration is identical with that of the permutations which are
such that the quantity x, occurs s,, times in places originally occupied by the
quantity «,, when g > p, and, as before, we take the coefficient of

Ag Age. Age es 5. Gg

Hence, an arithmetical correspondence, and, also, the fact that the true generating
function for the enumeration of these permutations is

1
[ T= 2, —2QA,, — Daz,—=O,,— DA, — Dann, }
— 11 — (gy — 1) (Agg — 1)... Annia — 1) tyre... Muy Pn _]

The above example is only a solitary one of a large number that might be furnished.
An advantageous method for procedure appears to be to take some simple interpret-
able redundant product, and to then pass through the condensed form to the general
redundant product, involving n — 1 undetermined quantities as well as quantities ¢,,,
which admit of a choice of values, The assignment of these quantities then leads to
