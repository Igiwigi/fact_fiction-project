The owners of the mine immediately proceeded, at their own expense, to make the
following preparations for the pendulums. 11. In the stable for the upper station, an additional brick wall was built round
three sides of the space (about 16 feet square) intended for the pendulum room, and
an additional substantial ceiling was constructed above it; and an anteroom was
constructed on the fourth side ; 80 that the room was in fact surrounded by double
walls and ceiling. The immediate entrance from the external air was into the ante-
room ; and from the anteroom there were doors into the pendulum room and into a
narrow room at, one side. [In this narrow room were afterwards placed the galvanic
batteries and journeyman-clock, and the lamp for illuminating the pendulum disk.
