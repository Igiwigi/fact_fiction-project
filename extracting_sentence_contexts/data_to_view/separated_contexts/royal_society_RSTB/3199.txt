‘This statement has been’ confirmed by all
subsequent observers, and no theory of the ascent of sap is worthy of a moment's
consideration which does not take this fact into account. According to SrRASBURGER,
the channels containing least air are most active in the ascent of sap, but this is the
direct physical consequence of the lesser resistance to flow in the vessels more
completely filled with water. The fact that the water disappears first from the
largest vessels led SrrasBuRGER to conclude that these are more used for storage
than conduction, but here again we have a direct physical consequence of the more
