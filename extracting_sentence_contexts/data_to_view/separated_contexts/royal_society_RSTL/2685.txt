I know of no exception to this law. All medicines
within their stimulant range excite, and unless the excitement exceeds the degree
which produces no correspondent depression, (for such a degree of excitement is com-
patible with the laws of the vital though not with those of the sensitive system*,) it
acts as a permanent tonic, All, beyond their stimulant range, act as directly, and
although within that range, if of a certain intensity, as indirectly debilitating powers
with respect to both systems√û. IT is evident from many facts, stated in my papers on the Nature of Sleep and
Death, that each of the foregoing systems is a whole, which cannot be influenced in
any one part without a tendeney to be affected in all others; a property which perhaps
more than any other influences the progress of their deviations from the healthy state;
for every part more or less feeling the change effected in any one, if there be any from
accidental causes more liable to disease than the rest, this part particularly feels the
cause which operates on all; and, as I shall soon have occasion to point out more
particularly, is even the means of diyerting its effects from every other part. 'Thus
it is that diseases of continuance become complicated, and that an affection, attended
with little risk in the part firs: impressed by the offending cause, often becomes
formidable by its secondary effects.

* My paper on the Nature of Sleep in the Philosophical Transactions for 1833.

+ See what is said on this subject in my treatise On the Influence of Minute Doses of Mercury in. restoring
the Functions of Health, and my Gulstonian Lectures on the more obscure affections of the Brain, also in the
recapitulation at the end of this paper, All my Treatises, to which I have occasion to refer, are more or less
founded on the principles here recapitulated ; and consequently in them more or less copious references to the
facts, on which these principles rest, became necessary, In order to arrive at the conclusions of the present
paper, it was necessary to 8tate the whole of those facts with their various bearings, which I have done in as
coneise a manner as the requisite perspicuity appeared to admit of. In the les familiar parts of the subject,
it requires some care to ayoid being migunderstood,
