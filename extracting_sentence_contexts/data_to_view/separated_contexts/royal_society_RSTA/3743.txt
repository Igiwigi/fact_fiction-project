The double refraction is shown by the above table to decrease at an accelerating
rate as the atomic weight of the alkali metal is increased. The amount of diminution
Sfor the first replacement is nearly double as much as the increase of mean refraction,
â€œwhich accounts for the fact already alluded to that the y indices of rubidium
Smagnesium selenate are slightly lower than those of potassium magnesium selenate. This latter apparent anomaly, therefore, is the direct outcome of the general rule so
afar established for the series as regards progressive diminution of double refraction. The instructive axial ratios of the optical ellipsoid (calculated for Na-light) are
Scompared in the following tables, and they are also graphically expressed in the
Bourves of fig.
