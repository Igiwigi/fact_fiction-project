than one type of linkage, subject to approximations. Here the assumption involved is that
the C—H bonds in the methyl compounds, for example, have the same strength as in
methane. Particularly in the case of the more electropositive metals, however, the C—H
bonds are probably weaker than in methane, so that the values indicated for the strengths
of the covalent metal bonds will tend to be on the low side.

Considering the values listed in table 11 as a whole, several points are worthy of especial
mention. Essentially, the covalent metal bonds are rather stronger relatively than might
have been expected, or indeed, have hitherto been supposed. The Al—C bond, for example,
is just about as strong as the C—C bond, and the Zn—C bond approaches the C—C bond
in strength. The B—C bond, in particular, appears to be unexpectedly strong, and ap-
preciably stronger than the C—C bond. It is well established that the B—F bond, for
example, is considerably stronger than the C—F bond, a fact which is easily accounted for
in terms of electronic structure. In the case of the B—C bond, the extra stabilization
relative to the C—C bond is smaller. It is not so simply explainable in terms of the vacant

orbital of the sp* boron atom, since the carbon atom possesses no lone pair of valence electrons.
Rather, the different type of hybridization of the boron atom with the resultant increase
of s character in the bonds suggests itself as an important factor. This factor will also be
operative for aluminium bonds and still more for those of the metals in group II of the
Periodic Table.
