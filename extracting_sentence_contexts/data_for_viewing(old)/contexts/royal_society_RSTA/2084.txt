thermodynamic theories with internal variables are as flexible as EIT, and also try to make
compatible the evolution equations for the system (including that of internal variables) with the
second law of thermodynamics, via a generalized entropy incorporating the contributions of the
internal variables. However, the fluxes play a special role in non-equilibrium thermodynamics,
because in steady state they describe a central aspect of the interaction of the system with the


environment. Comparison between theories with internal variables and EIT, for some concrete
systems, is very illustrative and stimulating. For instance, in the approach of [38] to heat transport,
a vectorial and a tensorial quantity are considered as internal variables; in the case that these
variables are identified with the heat flux and the flux of the heat flux, the resulting equations
for the heat equation, the entropy and the entropy flux become very close to those of extended
irreversible thermodynamics. The fact that the generalized entropy flux has been introduced in a
very different form than in such theory makes the coincidence of the results of both approaches
especially reassuring, as they are supporting each other.

Despite their restricted character, the answers provided by extended thermodynamics to the
previously mentioned conceptual questions may be a useful guide to more general situations,
and they are helpful to give to the mentioned answers some more precise and concrete forms.
For instance, the reduction of the extended entropy with respect to the local-equilibrium entropy
may be physically interpreted in two different but complementary and mutually consistent ways.
On the one side, the reduction arises from the entropy produced by the relaxation of the fluxes
during their decay towards their zero equilibrium value after the system (in fact, a small volume
of the system) has been suddenly insulated. A second interpretation is in terms of the reduction
of the number of accessible microscopic states when the system is submitted to a non-vanishing
