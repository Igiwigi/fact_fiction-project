There being no reason to sup-
pose deposition from solution, are we not under the necessity
of inferring, that the mineralizing process witnessed in its
effects, depends on a slow motion and separation of the
particles of the original compound ? and, must we not con-
clude, that this motion is connected with the operation of
electrochemical powers ?* Supposing the oxides first formed
upon the bronze in a state of negative electricity, with respect
to the metal, their agency, in a long course of ages would
be to separate the least oxidable metal, the copper, in its
pure form ; and all the changes are such as may be accounted
for from agencies of the same kind, but of different intensity. And may not similar explanations be given of other like

* The separation of the copper from the tin in the bronzes found in the ancient
cities destroyed by volcanic eruptions, must be referred to another source ; namely,
the crystallizations dependent upon degrees of heat a little below the point of fusion
of the alloy.

phenomena, which often seem to occur in the mineral
kingdom ? These facts offer an obvious practical application,
both in determining the antiquity and genuineness of ancient
works of art; for zrugo of the kind which I have described
could not be successfully imitated by any artificial processes ;
and a very slight chemical examination, or even one by the
lens, would be sufficient to expose any fraud attempted to be
practiszed by substituting modern imitations for ancient
works. I am, most truly yours,
