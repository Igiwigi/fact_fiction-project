stream-line. At nodal points on or near the vertical side boundaries, special ‘relaxation .
patterns’ were employed to take account of the evanescence, at such boundaries, of Oy /dx.

37. Figure 23 presents our accepted wave-profiles for the cases investigated. Figure 24 |
relates the non-dimensional wave-length / with the non-dimensional crest-height A (i.e. —
the height of the wave-crest above the level of the undisturbed stream) for values of A
ranging between 0 and 1/12 (at which value a cusp at stagnation level replaces the smooth —
wave-crest). Within that range / falls from 1-11 to 0-88. .

The higher value does not agree with the value predicted by equation (47), and we have —
not yet succeeded in accounting for the discrepancy. Though small (of the order of 6 %), a
it can hardly be due to errors of computation, in view of the consistency of the plotted points
in figure 24. In fact quite unusually high standards of accuracy were imposed in these com-
putations, as is shown by the pairs of numerals appended to the wave profiles in figure 23.
(The upper numeral of each pair gives the computed value of 0//dv, the lower gives the
‘error’ 7 defined in § 36.) Our reasons were (1) the tendency of errors to cancel and so to
remain undetected near side-boundaries, (2) our desire to determine accurately (and for

the first time) the nature of the variation of J with A. Obviously this last objective would
have been attained more easily if / had varied more rapidly. ;
