Load extension diagrams of the kind shown in this and former papers are likely to
be useful to the engineer and metallurgist in the correlation of the many different
tests now made to ascertain the quality of metals,

For example, fig. 25 was taken from a test piece of material giving a low impact
number. Its shape differs markedly from the shape of a normal diagram. It

corresponds in fact with the shape of the curve found from overstrained material. Fig. 25 (overstrained mild steel). PROPERTIES AND THE ELASTIC EXTENSION OF METALS. 137

The inference is that the material is in the overstrained condition.
