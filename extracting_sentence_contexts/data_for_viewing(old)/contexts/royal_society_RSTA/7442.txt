However, in a number of instances the results of the Coulomb approximation are seriously
different from the results of Hylleraas (though not from the less extensive results of Goldberg).
To investigate the significance of the discrepancies the values of the variable n#* .—n¥ required
to reproduce Hylleraas’s figures were determined.{ From each of these were subtracted
the corresponding values obtained directly from the energy levels in the usual way. The
magnitudes of the resulting quantities A(nj ,,7j*) are given in table 9. If the differences in
the two sets of values of a? were due to it being incorrect to identify the energy parameters
used in the Coulomb approximation with the term values, then the A’s associated with
a given type of transition would exhibit certain characteristics. In particular, they would all
xt be of the same sign and, as functions of n#* , and nj, would be slowly and regularly varying.
& Such behaviour is not followed by the figures in the table. Instead, some are positive and
2 some are negative, and the variation with n*_, and n*¥ is erratic; especially striking is the
§ fact that, while most of the figures are small, an occasional one is abnormally large. A possible
@ interpretation is that there are some numerical mistakes in Hylleraas’s work. The correctness
‘© of this is supported by the ill success of the summation tests he applied.
§ Inspite of the suggested defects in them the results of Hylleraas provide valuable evidence
® that it is a good approximation to equate the energy parameters to the term values. Thus,
ob in table 10, it is plausible to omit, as unreliable, figures whose modulus is greater than or
equal to 0-05. And, as can readily be verified, the remaining figures in each section show
5 no marked tendency to be either positive or negative. Their mean values, A, are as follows:

EB A(s-p, singlets) = +0-00,,
e A(s-p, triplets) = —0-00,,
3 A(p-d, singlets) = + 0-00,,
£ A(p-d, triplets) = +0-01,.
