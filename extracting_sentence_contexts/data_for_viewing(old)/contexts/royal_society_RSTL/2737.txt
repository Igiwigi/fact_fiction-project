excited in the latter. Thus even a diseased organ will often regain its healthy tate,
when the disease has spread to another, particularly if in the latter, it takes deeper root,
if I may use the expression. It is a daily occurrence for a disease of function 'to be
finally removed by a disease of structure being established in another organ. Hence
the good effects of artificially exciting disease in external parts to relieve those more
immediately essential to life ; and the still more salutary effect, when the laws of our
frame themselves produce the same effect, because here it is the uninfluenced result
of those laws, whereas in the former case their tendency is constrained by artificial
means. Thus for example it is that the inflammation of a gouty joint or other ex-
ternal disease often relieves the derangement of a vital organ, and that artificially re-
pelling this effort of the constitution to save a vital part, has s0 often proved fatal.

On the facts that the central organs of the vital system directly influence the func-
tions both of the vital nerves and of the vessels of every part, while those of the s8en-
sitive system have no direct influence on either, many of the phenomena of disease de-
pend ; because it is only in proportion as these nerves and the vessels of the part are
influenced, that any disease of the part itself exists, and consequently that there is any
tendency to derangement either of function or structure in the part ; of function alone
if the neryes alone are affected, of structure also as 800n as the vessels partake of the
disease. Hence it is that the tendency to change of structure, except where it takes
place by imperceptible degrees, is, ceteris paribus, always proportioned to an inflam-
matory tendency which may be detected in the part, this tendency being the first
indication that the vessels partake of the disease ; and hence the importance of care-
fully watching and checking its approach, if the part be one essential to life, in all
cases of deranged function of, or even of painful sensations referred to, particular parts.
