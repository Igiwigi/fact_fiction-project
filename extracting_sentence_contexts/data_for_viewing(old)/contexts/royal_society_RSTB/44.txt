Professor Firowrr has dealt in the first of his papers above referred to.* His
conclusion was that the permanent dentition was the original one, and that the milk
set had been afterwards developed as an addition to it—a view to which, although
inclined at first to disagree, | have now become a firm adherent. To this opinion I
have come by finding the impossibility of working out the general homologies of the
teeth on the basis of the opposite view, and by the comparison of an infinitely larger
number of specimens of various sorts than even Professor FLoweEr had access to.
The chief cause of the prevalence of the opinion that the permanent dentition is a
later development than the milk is the deceptive appearance presented in the early
stages of tooth-development, when the germ of the permanent tooth is first seen as
a bud growing out from that of the milk-tooth, whence it has naturally been supposed
that the latter was the primary and the former the secondary development. Even
should this appearance of budding off, however, be entirely correct—and the fact
itself is strongly denied by R. Baumet—it may be argued that, considering the
uniform direction of the evidence drawn from later stages, there is no sufficient reason
to deny the possibility of a secondary organ, whose very raison d’étre, as in the case
of the milk-tooth, is its speedy and precocious development, so overshadowing in
size and rapidity of growth what is really the primary as to make the latter appear
as its bud, and therefore, although falsely, as a secondary and subsidiary growth.

A second, apparently adverse, argument may be drawn from the few instances
known of milk-teeth{ developed, and remaining through life, without having, or
only rarely having, true permanent successors, as in the anterior premolars of the
Proboscidea § and some of the Perissodactyla, || but these are clearly due to the teeth
