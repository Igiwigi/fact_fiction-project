coslenteric expansions of the disc were rendered permanent as a means of better
attachment, The base of the disc and the rootlets or rug became strengthened by
calcareous cell deposit, and formed a part of the primitive “ Rugose epitheca.”

A few phases of evolution having been successfully passed through, the enterprising
coral may be pictured as taller and stronger with a whorl of tentacles and a number
of rootlets. Its basal body-wall was pulled up and tucked in at the sides, but curled
loosely round the whorl of tentacles, and so far hooded the polyp when the tentacles
were retracted.

In every tuck calcareous cell-deposit gathered here and there, just as it did in the
basal disc. The primitive “septal trabecule” and “spines” thus formed, were
therefore continuous with the epitheca, and, in fact, between adjacent “ septal” tucks,
the ectoderm continued actively depositing epitheca.

If the curls and wrinkles of the peripheral ring of the body-wall were particularly
loose, it might easily happen, with further growth, that only the innermost wrinkle
kept up the original connection with the septa, while the outer wrinkles became more
variable. Thus the inner part would be differentiated as a theca, and would be
protected by the less regular deposit of the further wall-wrinkles. The so-calied
theca and epitheca are inherent parts of one and the same tangential structure,

Should calicoblastic activity in the peripheral area prove, on the contrary, to be
relatively small, and the main area of deposit be in the radial folds, the tendency
towards higher complication of the septal structures would be given. Rapid upward
