G. C. B. P.R.S.

Read June 13, 1816. Dear SIR,

Sixcr I had last the honour to address a communication to
you, with a _request that” you would lay it before the Royal
Society, I have repeated great part of the experiments which
formed the subjects of my former Letters, with such addi-
tions and variations, as might probably lead to the detection
of any erroneous conclusions which I might have drawn :
but I have not been able to detect any errors, nor to add any.
thing very important to my- former observations. I have,
however, been able to ascertain a few new facts, which I
think too interesting to be lost. I endeavoured, in my former communications, to adduce
evidence, that the matter, which becomes vitally united to
trees, previously passes through their leaves; and I shall
now proceed to state' sme_ facts, which, I trust, will prove,
that a fluid possessing the. power which I have attributed to
the true sap, actually descends through the leaf stalks.
