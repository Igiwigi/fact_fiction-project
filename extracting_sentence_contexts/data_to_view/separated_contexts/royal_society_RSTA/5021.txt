We are concerned exclusively with a plane-strain situation that involves deformations taking
place in the 12-plane. In this particular case, the equations (3.1) and (3.2) admit a number of
simplifications that will not be reiterated here ([12, pp. 173-178], for instance), and the solution



of the linear micropolar elasticity is readily available with the help of Mindlin’s stress potentials
[24], 6 = 0(x1,x2), W = W(x1,x2), defined according to

where Ip is the two-dimensional identity tensor in the 12-plane, N(¢) := (V76)Inp — V @ Vo, and
a similar relation holds for N(y). Because of the plane-strain assumption the only non-zero
components of the couple-stress tensor are /4p3 and 43, (9 =1,2), and in (3.4), we have tacitly
assumed that pp = 1413e1 + /423€2 as 431 and 132 do not feature in the equilibrium equations and
can in fact be obtained directly from 113 and j13, respectively (e.g. [12]). The compatibility conditions for the strain measures (e.g. [10,12]) demand that the stress
functions must satisfy the following set of partial differential equations

vig=0, @vt¢—V26=0 (3.52) :=

Note that, in the couple-stress limit (i.e. y > 00), we have ¢ > ¢,. In [27], the key parameters for
the micropolar theory were

and it is easy to see from table 1 that the limit of (1 — vb? /ct as y — oo is just (1 — v), which
explains why in that work the micropolar solutions were obtained from the corresponding couple-
stress results by performing the substitution

Relating the micropolar constitutive constants that appear in (3.2) to the micromechanical
properties of discrete element solids can be traced to the contributions of Chang et al. [8] and
Miihlhaus & Oka [35].
