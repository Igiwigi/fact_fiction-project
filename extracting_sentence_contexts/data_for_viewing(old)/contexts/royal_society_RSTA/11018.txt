others ; if we substitute for these two in the identity

Xu, v)
du, v) = z Bats 5) Ua xj),

we find that d(u, v) is a linear combination of the determinants of the matrix of tent
columns.

* This solution will not be a complete primitive unless a certain number of other arbitrary constants are
involved as well as a, ), a supposition which is neither made nor excluded.

It may be well to point out that the solution here assumed consists of two equations, and not of one
equation involving an arbitrary function; in fact, any solution whatever necessarily consists of two
equations, and one point of the present method is that these are to be sought together, not successively.

+ For » independent variables the number of columns in the matrix will be 4(n + 1)(n + 2), the
number of rows being still three,
