organism probably lies in the introduction, at planting of the second crop, of tubers
which were apparently healthy but which really bore free resting sporangia upon their
surface.

What is required, therefore, is to discover in the first place whether the organism
really persists for a long period in the soil, and, if it should be proved that it does so
exist, to discover whether the resting sporangium remains ungerminated, or whether
the infection of other host plants, or the assumption of a saprophytic mode of life, is
responsible for the maintenance of the fungus.

Immunity from Wart Disease.

It is a well known fact that certain varieties of potato are immune to wart disease,
but the cause of this immunity is still to be discovered. In the case of the immunity
of certain wheats to Puccinia glumarum, Miss Marryat (29) has shown that,
“though the fungus succeeds in making good its entry and producing hyphe,
further progress is either completely checked by the breaking down and death of the
host tissue locally, accompanied by the starvation and death of the parasite,” or else,
in cases of partial immunity, ‘“‘a more protracted struggle takes place . . . and the
development of the fungus proceeds to a farther point, but is still greatly retarded.”

In the varieties of flax immune to Fusariwm Lint, it was found by TispaLe
and JonEs(18) that in this case also the fungus succeeds in penetrating the host
plant. In the susceptible varieties, the parasite penetrates directly to the vessels of
the root. ‘In the resistant individuals, on the other hand, the invasion advances
