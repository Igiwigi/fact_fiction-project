I am led by some
results to suspect that it then even passes into the repulsive force noticed by Ampers*;
which is the cause of the elevations in mercury described by Sir Humenry Davy +,
and which again is probably directly connected with the quality of intensity.

1114. Notwithstanding that the effects appear only at the making and breaking of
contact, (the current remaining unaffected, seemingly, in the interyal,) I cannot resist
the impression that there is some connected and correspondent effect produced by
this lateral action of the elements of the electric stream during the time of its conti-
nuance (60. 242.). An action of this kind, in fact, is evident in the magnetic relations
of the parts of the current. But admitting (as we may do for the moment) the mag-
netic forces to constitute the power which produces such striking and different results
at the commencement and termination of a current, still there appears to he a link in
the chain of effects, a wheel in the physical mechanism of the action, as yet unrecog-
nised. If we endeayour to consider electricity and magnetism as the results of two
forces of a physical agent, or a peculiar condition of matter, exerted in determinate
directions perpendicular to each other, then, it appears to me, that we must consider
these two states or forces as convertible into each other in a greater or smaller degree ;
i. e, that an element of an electric current has not a determinate electric force and a
determinate magnetic force constantly existing in the same ratio, but that the two
forces are, to a certain degree, convertible by a process or change of condition at pre-
sent unknown to us.
