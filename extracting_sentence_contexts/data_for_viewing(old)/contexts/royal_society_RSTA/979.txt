where A=(Ai(x) is the corresponding Poisson tensor. If the rank of A is smaller than
the dimension of M, the basic definition of a finite-dimensional integrable system given in
Introduction needs a small modification. Namely, we will assume that the number of independent
commuting first integrals (including the Hamiltonian H) equals

3(dim M + corank A),

where the co-rank of A is taken at a generic point. This condition is equivalent to the fact that the
subspace spanned by the differentials of the first integrals in the cotangent space TM at a generic
point x â‚¬ M is maximal isotropic with respect to the Poisson tensor A (which is exactly the same
condition as what we use in the symplectic case).


One of the most effective methods for constructing and studying integrable systems is based
on the notion of compatible Poisson structures; for example [139,140]. Recall that two Poisson
brackets { , }; and { , }2 on M are called compatible if any linear combination of them is again a
Poisson bracket. The set of all non-trivial linear combinations of two compatible Poisson brackets
{,}1 and {, }z is called a Poisson pencil.
