Figure 4. Probability distributions of the Kolmogorov multipliers o; = In |a;/aj_1| for different positions in the inverse
(a) and direct (b) turbulent cascades. Solid lines correspond to the thermal equilibrium P(o) = 1/2 cosh’(a — &), where
& = —(1/3) In @ for the inverse cascade and G = —(2/3) In @ for the direct one. The variance ((a — &)*) ~ 0.75 for
both cascades, which is much larger than either of the squared mean values. (Online version in colour.)

fluctuate slower than the arguments of f. Let us stress the fundamental difference between the
equations on the amplitudes, which are local, and the non-local equations on kj, which involve
all the multipliers, starting from pumping up to the given mode. While we cannot rigorously
prove it yet, we find it plausible that the fact that all i— q — 1 — M random multipliers in (7.2) and
(7.4) are correlated makes correlation between any finite number of them weak, which must be
eventually responsible for the emerging translation invariance of the statistics of k; in the limit
|i—_M|>1,p,q. The analogy is the validity of the mean-field description in systems with long-
range interaction [33]. It is not yet clear how to make a meaningful mean-field approximation in
(7.2) and (7.4) to establish explicitly the asymptotic universal statistics of k; in a general case.
However, in the degenerate symmetric case a =1/2, the interaction time for the statistically
stationary solution is independent of the mode number, and the statistics of the amplitudes is
Gaussian. In that case, one may hope to find analytically the joint statistics of the multipliers.
Normalized for zero mean and unit variance, we compute for oj = Ink;:

Peg(O1,---,On) = 2"nl[1 + e771 (1 + e72(1 +++ + e771 (1+ 2)" exp [po 2k+ 10+] .
