Curves of Temperature at High Levels.

Proceeding from the sea-level to considerable altitudes, we find that the mean
temperature at Poona, in 1830, at 1823 feet above the sea-level, was 8028, differing
only six-tenths from the mean temperature of Bombay for 1844, and less than one
degree of Farr. from the mean temperature of 1843 at Bombay. A difference of
level of 1823 feet therefore gave a difference of less than one degree of temperature.

The comparison of the temperatures of the three stations of Mahabuleshwur, Mer-
cara in Coorg, and Uttray Mullay in Travancore, all at the height of 4500 feet above
the sea-level, and differing little in longitude, but several degrees in latitude, affords
some interesting facts. The latitude of Uttray Mallay is about 8? 00' N., long. 76* 00' F.,
Mereara, lat. 12 30, long. 73* 30', Mahabuleshwar, lat. 17* 58', long. 732 29'. The mean
temperature of Uttray Mullay, situated nearest to the equator, is /ower by 3*35 than
the mean temperature of Mercara, and 266 lower than that of Mababuleshwaur, while
the mean temperatures of Mercara and Mahabuleshwur are almost identical. The
maximum heat of Mahabuleshwur, in both years recorded, is in April, while the mean
of three years at Mercara fixes it in March. At Uttray Mullay the maximum heat, in
1845, was in April, while in 1846 it was in March. At 4140 feet above these levels,
namely, at Dodabetta, the maximum heat was, in May, as in Bombay and Calcutta.
The minimum heat, at the height of 4500 feet, was in December, at Mahabuleshwur
and Mercara in all the years. At Uttray Mullay, in 1845, the minimum mean monthly
heat was in June, the only instance of the kind in all the observations discussed in this
paper; and in this same year January and October had the same mean temperature. In
