The investigation which I have now the honour to. offer to the Royal Society is in a
certain sense complementary to those referred to at the outset of this paper. It deals
with the relations of gaseous matter to the most refrangible rays of the spectrum. It
treats of the chemical energies of such rays as exerted upon snch matter. If we
except the combination of chlorine and hydrogen by light, and the decomposition of
carbonic acid by the solar rays in the leaves of plants, which latter, however, may not
be the decompoxsition of @ gas, no fact I believe has hitherto been known to exist in
which light, or heat in the radiant form, acts chemically upon a gas or vapour*. By
this inquiry the range of radiant energy as a chemical agent is considerably extended ;
the phenomena resulting from that energy are exhibited in a new and exceedingly
impressive form, and they prompt reflections regarding the possible influence of solar
radiation on the gases, vapours, and effluyia of our atmosphere which could not previously
be entertained.

The inquiry was started thus:—TIt is known to the Society that the experiments on
radiant heat already referred to, were for the most part performed in tubes of brass or
glass, called for the sake of distinction © experimental tubes.” It is also known to the
physical members of the Society that a differencef exists between my eminent friend
Professor MaGxus{, and myself with regard to the deportment of aqueous vapour towards
