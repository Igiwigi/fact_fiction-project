If this view be correct, it would be only a
slight step further back to refer the whole series, as regards its origin, to the condition
of a simple strobilus, in which all the leaves would be fertile ; this condition is at
least approached in LZ. Selago, in which the sporangia appear at an exceptionally early
stage on the seedling plant. This fact, together with the undifferentiated shoot and
simple sporangium, mark off the sporophyte of L. Selago as a relatively primitive type
of Lycopod. Pihylloglossum has been commonly regarded as the most primitive type of Lycopod,
and its strobilus certainly seems to be the simplest. The question has been discussed
elsewhere as to the nature of the protocorm and protophylls, which are such prominent
features in its vegetative system, and the view entertained that they show specially
adaptive, rather than general Lycopodinous characters.
