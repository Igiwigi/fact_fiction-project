one of them terminates in the vena porta ; the termination of the other I have not ascertained in a satisfactory
manner ; I believe it corresponds in function to the umbilical arteries, and brings blood from the fotus to the

not incompatible with its being ovoviviparous, as it is considered Ã¾y the naturalists
who have paid most attention to the subject ; yet I believe it is not strictly 80, and
that it is more correct to say that it is intermediate between ovoviviparons and
viviparous, the foetus, as I believe, deriving its support in part from the oyum, and
in part from the parent. The principal fact on which I found this belief is, that the

The first Table will relate to the oyum just after it has entered the uterine cavity,
or before the appearance of the embryo; the second, to the ovum after the fetal
development has commenced, but has made little progress ; and the third, to the
