They are not developed like those in the
generative segments; they belong to the class of the © ordinary” segmental organs. These intervening annuli are not crossed in this worm, as described and figured by
HrrNG in Tambricus agricola, by the vasa deferentia and oviducts. In fact they are
altogether excluded from, and beyond the limits of the reproductive segments. Now, in studying the visceral contents of each ring within the limits of the generative
region, it will be best to proceed from behind forwards. The dissector thus comes first upon the largest and most prominent (fig. 6, #, 7) of all
the generative masses.
