1. The general Appearance and Staining with Reagents.—In specimens prepared as
above, and stained with picrocarminate of ammonia, they both present a granular
appearance and stain of a yellow colour, more or less bright. In sections stained with
hematoxylin they both present generally a uniform, sometimes a finely granular, aspect,
and stain of a greyish-violet colour.

2. The Consistence.—The reasons for considering the contents of the lymphatics to be
during life of a viscid consistence have already been given (se above, page 562). The
contents of the vesicles are (as stated above, page 558) described by KdLLIKER and FREY
as consisting of a clear viscid fluid; and, as far as I have seen, there appears no reason
to doubt this assertion, though I have not directly proved its accuracy.

From these facts it appears that the contents of the lymphatics are morphologically
identical with those of the vesicles, and they give a strong reason for suspecting that
the two materials are also identical in other respects.

It is of material importance to remember that in all but one or two of the cases which
have been examined, most of the vesicles, as well as the lymphatics, contained the
material above described ; and it is further important to bear in mind that the material
in the lymphatics fills and even distends the vessels completely, without containing any
formed corpuscles; the material cannot therefore be lymph. Hence it is reasonable
to think that one, possibly the chief, function of the thyroid gland is the formation, within
the vesicles, of a material which is transferred from these by the lymphatics to the
general circulation, there to serve s0me purpose in the animal economy as yet unknown.
