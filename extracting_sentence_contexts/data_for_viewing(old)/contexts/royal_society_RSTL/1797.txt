of the mercury is radiated in all directions from-the point of
contact to the circumference of the globule, and: that the
whole of the hydrogen-is given off at the-other end of the
wire: where it touches:the liquid: - A little consideration will
suffice, however, to show that both these effects are merely
_- modifications of one and the same.'- It is-not to, or from the
wire as guch,' that 'the superficial particles radiate; they
merely follow the direction/'of the-predominant electric:cur-
rents in their passage through the liquid. It is in- fact the
case of the source of positive electricity, being, the mercury
itself, instead of 'its being conveyed to it from a pile at a
distance.

27. Having thus distinetly traced the alteration in the me-
chanical effect by contact with the negative pole, to the amal-
gamation of the mercury with sodium, the knowledge of this
fact led me to investigate more minutely the effects of diffe-
rent metals in their contact and amalgamation with mercury ;
and the results T have encountered in the course of these en-
quiries, appear to me 80; remarkable, that I cannot forbear
annexing them, especially as they afford an explanation of
