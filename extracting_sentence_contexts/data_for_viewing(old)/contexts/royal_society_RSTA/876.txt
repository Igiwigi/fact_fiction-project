The goal of quantum communications is to outperform its classical counterpart in a number of iB
communication primitives such as privacy, secrecy and authentication. Quantum key distribution : =
(QKD) [3], for example, allows two parties to distill a common key with provable unconditional 8
security [4], a level of secrecy that is simply not achievable by classical communication, which : o
must accept computational hardness assumptions, many of which might no longer be valid as : >
quantum computers become more mature [5]. Furthermore, quantum communications is the : =
backbone for the quantum Internet [6], a network of new devices that will revolutionize the way : =e

we communicate and perform computational tasks.

Despite the many advances of fibre-optics quantum communications, a real global-scale
quantum communication network cannot be deployed using only fibre-optics connections. In
fact, the signal attenuation and the polarization-preservation issues render fibre-optic links quite
problematic and limit their lengths to a few hundred kilometres [7]. A possible work-around can
be given by quantum repeaters [8], but the most promising solution to this problem is the use of
space technologies to develop satellite links [9]. Such channels could potentially lead to a global
quantum communication network as they could connect any two points on the Earthâ€™s surface
with reduced propagation losses as compared with terrestrial channels, even in the presence
of noise [10]. The importance of such satellite quantum links is attested in several continental
information and communication technology road-maps [11-15].

Recently, several experimental efforts have been realized, demonstrating not only the
feasibility but also the implementation of satellite-to-ground links for quantum communications
[16]. The Chinese Academy of Science satellite Micius, named in honour of the Chinese
philosopher, has implemented fundamental tests in space [17], quantum communication
