Such a method is, I believe, provided by the Method of Maximum Likelihood, although
I am not satisfied as to the mathematical rigour of any proof which I can put forward to that
effect’ [1, p. 323]. Fisher was immensely creative, so perhaps it is not surprising not all of his ideas are mutually
consistent. Recall John Maynard Keynes, when accused of being inconsistent, remarking that : =
when the facts changed he changed his mind. Of Fisher, Efron has said: ‘Fisher usually wrote as :
if he had a complete logic of statistical inference in hand, but that didn’t stop him from changing :
his system when he thought up another landmark idea’ [13, §4.3]. nee)

The 1922 paper is a long one, some 60 pages, and not all of it is of great interest to modern eyes. :
The second half of the paper is concerned mostly with Pearsonian families of curves, the method [4
of moments and discrete distributions, and has had less lasting impact. DNS

Fisher’s paper of 1922 provided elements for a solid framework for statistical inference, and a
these elements are still central to practical applications.
