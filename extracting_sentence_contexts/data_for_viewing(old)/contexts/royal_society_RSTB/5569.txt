here. But they also, in their relations to the stem, seem to correspond to leaves. It
is true that the primary distal region of the leaf in 7'â€™mesipteris and the whole appendage
in Psilotum are cylindrical, and that the mode of appearance of the appendages in the
transition region from the leafless rhizome to the aerial shoot suggests comparison with
what is known for Asterorylon. These are points consistent with a comparison of the
appendages with emergences, but do not render this necessary. For our present purpose
it is enough to recognise how these existing types of small-leaved Pteridophyta, in
contrast with the megaphyllous groups, indicate the problem on which historical
evidence from the fossil record is desirable.

The interest of Thursophyton and Asteroxylon is, as was pointed out above, that their
appendages are comparable on the one hand to definite small leaves and on the other to
emergences such as those of Psilophyton. In all cases our knowledge of the facts is
incomplete and needs to be critically extended. No structural details are available
regarding the appendages borne by Asteroxylon elberfeldense from the Middle Devonian
of Germany (KrAvuset and WryLanp, 1923, 1926, 1929). It is of interest that the lower
part of the erect shoot of this plant has been compared with Thursophyton and a higher
region of the branch-system with Psilophyton. Detailed comparative knowledge of
the appendages in the various regions of this plant would evidently be most instructive.

In Asteroxylon Mackiet (Kipston and Lana, 1920) there is the advantage of our
knowledge of the appendages being based on petrified material. They show a gradual
increase in size in the transition region from the leafless rhizome to the small-leaved
shoot. Hach of the fully developed leaves on the latter has a vascular strand, coming
from the stele of the stem, but the leaf-trace stops at the base of the leaf and is not
