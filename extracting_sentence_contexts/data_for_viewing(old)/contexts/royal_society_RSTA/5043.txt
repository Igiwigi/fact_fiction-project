The conception of a particle having its motion connected with that of a vortex by perfect
rolling contact may appear somewhat awkward. I do not bring it forward as a mode of
connection existing in Nature .. . It is however a mode of connection which is mechanically
conceivable and it serves to bring out the actual mechanical connections between known
electromagnetic phenomena.

No one could deny Maxwell’s virtuosity in determining the speed of light from his mechanical
model of electromagnetic forces.


5. Act 4. Maxwell on ‘A dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field’ (1865) 9 |

Maxwell was well aware of the fact that the theory as propounded in his paper ‘On Physical .
lines of force’ was ‘awkward’ and considered it only a ‘provisional and temporary hypothesis’. ia
The mechanical basis of his insights could be misunderstood, or even ridiculed, but they 1
had set Maxwell off on the right track towards the definitive theory of the electromagnetic [3
field. He therefore set about recasting the theory on a much more abstract basis without any io
special assumptions about the nature of the medium through which electromagnetic phenomena :S
are propagated. In 1865, he published his great paper entitled ‘A dynamical theory of the a
electromagnetic field’ [1]. To quote Whittaker [25, vol. 1, p. 255]: 12

In this, the architecture of his system was displayed, stripped of the scaffolding by aid of :
which it had been first erected. [=

Interestingly, there is only one, somewhat apologetic, reference in a footnote to his papers ‘On : 3
