three of hydrogen combine with one of azote, and one of
hydrogen with one of chlorine, I thought it probable that the
new compound would contain three of chlorine to one of
azote, which is not the case.

This compound is the first instance known of one proportion

of a substance uniting to four proportions of another substance,
without some intermediate compound of 1 and 1, 1 and 2, and
1 and g; and the fact should render us cautious in adopting
hypothetical views of the composition of bodies from the rela-
tions of the quantities in which they combine. Those who argue
that there must be one proportion of oxygen in azote, because
there ought to be six proportions in nitric acid, instead of five,
which are produced from it by analysis, might with full as
much propriety contend, that there must be azote in chlorine
in some simple multiple of that existing in the compound.

It may be useful to shew, that many hypotheses may be
framed upon the same principles; and which, consequently,
must be equally uncertain. Views of this nature may be im-
portant in directing the practical chemist in his researches ;
