Einstein's ‘spooky action at a distance’, too, refers 3
to an instantaneous action, in conflict with relativity as well, but not defined by it. The standard .
quantum mechanics is not relativistic, but it is, or may be interpreted as or required to be local. The locality of quantum mechanics also implies that it is in compliance with the requirements of
relativity, but it may be a deeper fact, as the Bell and the Kochen-Specker theorems and related
findings may indicate as well. This need not mean that locality is quantum in origin, but only that
it might be a deeper aspect of nature than those, such as the Lorentz invariance, defining relativity
theory, which, however, is local as well.

3. From Newtonian mechanics to analytical mechanics to quantum mechanics

As must be apparent from the preceding discussion, the difference between realist and non-
realist models of reality is fundamental and irreducible, whatever features these models possess
otherwise, in particular, whether realist models are visualizable or not.
