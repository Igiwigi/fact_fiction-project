Participants indicated either answer by
ticking a box on a screen (yes/no or male/female) with a
mouse (forced choice). In order not to bias the participants and
to ensure attention, participants were told that body odours
would only be presented in some, but not all trials. In fact,
odours were presented during all trails and no blank trials
were included. For odour detection as well as for the assessment
of the donors’ gender, a hit rate was calculated, defined as per-
centage of correct answers. Missing data within the detection
task were treated as ‘not detected’.
