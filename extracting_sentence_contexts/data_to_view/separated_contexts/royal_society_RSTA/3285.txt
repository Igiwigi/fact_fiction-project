Noting this, the free-boundary problem may then be reformulated as a linear elliptic problem
for y coupled with a nonlinear boundary condition at the free boundary, given by

The nonlinear boundary condition is a reformulation of the Bernoulli condition (restricted to the
free surface), given by
u? + w? P-—Pa
2g 2
which is interpreted as a form of energy conservation throughout the closure of the fluid domain
2. The constant Q is the hydraulic head, and the reader is referred to [8,15,33] for further
discussion of its physical significance.

(ii) The velocity potential

Irrotationality of the flow ensures the velocity field u may be written in terms of a velocity
potential y, according to

Gx=uU-—c, g=w (3.13)
and again the fact that the flow is both irrotational and incompressible also ensures the velocity
potential is harmonic in the interior of the fluid domain. Integrating, we find that the velocity
potential may be written according to

p(x, Z) =|. (u(L,z) — c) dl + I. w(x, s) ds, (3.14)

Xo zo
where the integration constant is chosen such that $(0,z) = 0. The 4A—periodicity of the vector field
also ensures

Q(x +A,Z) = V(x, Z) — cA. (3.15)
(iii) The conformal mapping

Introducing the variables

is a conformal mapping (in the interior) of the fluid domain onto a fixed boundary domain.
