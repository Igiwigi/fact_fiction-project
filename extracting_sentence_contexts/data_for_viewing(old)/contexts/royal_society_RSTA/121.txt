paths in the fluid are never closed if the free surface is not flat.” It is therefore
natural to wonder whether the effects of surface tension could alter this feature of
irrotational water flows. The paper by Henry (2007) establishes that for linear
capillary and capillary-gravity irrotational water waves, the particle trajectories
are not closed if the free surface of water is not flat.

A vortex sheet is the free boundary between two fluids shearing past each
other in irrotational flow, the vorticity being measure-valued and supported on
the free boundary between the fluids. Linearizing the equation of motion of the
vortex sheet one obtains that the motion is linearly stable if surface tension acts,
while linear instability holds if the effects of surface tension are neglected—an
effect known as the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (Saffman 1995). The paper by
Ambrose (2007) presents a proof of the fact that surface tension regularizes the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability for the full nonlinear equations.

Several papers of this issue are devoted to qualitative studies of two recently
derived integrable nonlinear models for the propagation of shallow water waves:
the CH equation (Camassa & Holm 1993; Johnson 2002) and the DP equation
(Degasperis & Procesi 1999). Both nonlinear PDEs share with the classical KdV
model the properties that they have a bi-Hamiltonian structure and are formally
integrable? (Fokas & Fuchssteiner 1981; Camassa & Holm 1993; Degasperis &
Procesi 1999). In the case of CH, an inverse scattering/inverse spectral analysis
can be performed and one can prove that the equation is completely integrable:
its flow is equivalent to the flow of a (mostly) infinite set of parameters moving
linearly at constant speed (Constantin & McKean 1999; Constantin 2001a;
