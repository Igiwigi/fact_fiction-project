Water at 70? or
80, for instance, has the effect of permanently diminishing the rate of the rhythm, after
having temporarily raised it for a few seconds. The following note will serve to convey
a just estimation of these facts :!—

« An Aurelia, whose rhythm in water at 40* was very regular at 18 per minute, was
snddenly transferred to water at 80%. In the immediately succeeding minutes the
rhythm was 22, 20, 14. The latter rate continued for nearly half an hour, when the
observation terminated.”
