Solutions of vanadium trioxide can also be obtained by partial oxidation of the
lavender-coloured solution of dioxide. If a current of air be passed through a reduced
solution in which the free acid has been neutralized by excess of zinc, and the remaining
metallic zine removed, the liquid attains a permanent brown colour, which, on the addi-
tion of a few drops of acid, turns to green. Both the brown and green liquids contain
trioxide in solution, the dioxide having taken up one atom of oxygen, as the following
analyses show :—

(1) 0:1672 V, O,, reduced by zinc and oxidized by air passing through for one hour,
required 21-9 cub. centims. of the foregoing permanganate solution for complete
oxidation.

(2) 0:1652 V, O,, treated in the same way, but exposed for four hours to a current of
air, required 21-0 cub. centims. permanganate (1 cub. centim. =0-001320 grm.
-oxygen).

Action of Chlorine upon Vanadium Triozide —The action of chlorine upon this oxide
led Benzei1Vs to give to it the formula VO, (V=68:5); but, as has already been gtated,
the fact that one-third of the vanadium remains in combination with oxygen in the
residual vanadic acid follows equally from the formula V, O, when V=51'3. Thus 3(V, 0,)+6 CL,=V, 0, +4V O Cl,. Two experiments made in order to test the purity of the trioxide prepared by reduc-
tion of vanadiec acid in hydrogen gave the following results:—
