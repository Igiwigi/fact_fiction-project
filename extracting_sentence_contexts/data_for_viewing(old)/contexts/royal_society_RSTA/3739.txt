Post-TS dynamics provided us the full set of mechanisms responsible for the experimental
formation of different products. In particular, now also the products that are formed through TSp
are obtained and the corresponding pathway is much shorter than that supposed to occur from
PES analysis (and also from a kinetic study on this PES).

4. Concluding remarks

The most relevant conclusion of our re-visiting the CID reactivity of [Ca(formamide)}*+ molecular
ions is that only a part of the observed reactivity can be accounted for from a survey of the
topology of the PES, and from a kinetic treatment that only takes into consideration statistically
driven processes. In fact, it seems that a complete picture can be only obtained when direct
collision and post-TS dynamics are accounted for. Indeed, some reaction paths are only open if one
does not impose a statistical behaviour to the system, that is, if one allows for non-IRC processes
to occur. This is precisely the case when the flux bifurcates on the downhill pathway towards
products, after crossing a given TS. Rather interestingly, non-IRC dynamics appear systematically
linked to the competition between the formation of two monocations (Coulomb explosion) or the
loss of a neutral yielding a smaller doubly charged cation. The possibility that one single TS may
lead to two different products implies the appearance of a new kind of selectivity that is controlled
after the TS is crossed, and not before as usually assumed for kinetic control. In this way, reaction
selectivity is controlled by dynamical factors, and in some specific cases may depend on where
the excitation energy is initially located. Indeed, although in most cases the product distribution is
similar regardless of where the excitation energy comes from, rotational or vibrational activation
of the TS, in some cases, we showed that rotational excitation may have a key role in determining
