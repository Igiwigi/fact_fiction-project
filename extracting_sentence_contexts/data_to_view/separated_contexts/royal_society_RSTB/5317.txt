The head is rounded and is set off from the body by a slight constriction. No papillie
or separate lips could be discovered on its surface. A mouth aperture is lacking and no
buccal rods or other specialised mouth structures are presentâ€”features doubtless con-
nected with the fact that the adult male does not feed. The outline of the fusiform
cesophagus present in the larval condition is now lost, but an cesophageal region is
present, extending from the head to a short distance behind the excretory pore, as a
faintly vacuolate and rather ill-defined area. The nerve-ring crosses the cesophagus
just in front of the excretory pore.
