oxygene, or such as contain oxygene in excess ; and all that
are attracted by negative electricity, are pure combustibles, or
such as consist chiefly of combustible matter,

The idea of muriatic acid, fluoric acid, and boracic acid con-
taining oxygene, is highly strengthened by these facts. And
the general principle confirms the conjecture just stated con-
cerning the nature of the earths.

In the electrization of boracic acid moistened with water, I
find that a dark coloured combustible matter is evolved at the
negative surface ; but the researeches upon the alkalies have
prevented me from pursuing this fact, which seems however
to indicate a decomposition.

Muriatic acid and fluoric acid in their gaseous states are
non-conductors : and as there is every reason to believe that
their bases have a stronger attraction for ox ygene than water,
there can be little hope of decomposing them in their aqueous
s0]utions, even by the highest powers. In the electrization of
some of their combinations there is however a probability of
SUCCESS.

An immense variety of objects of research is presented in
the powers and affinities of the new metals produced from the
