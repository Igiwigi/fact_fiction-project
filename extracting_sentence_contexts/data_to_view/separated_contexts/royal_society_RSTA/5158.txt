A good policy that is (in part)
trying to police intent should not incentivize dishonesty about research motives.

7SPICE (Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate Engineering) was a multi-university SRM research project funded by the
UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council. The most high profile component of the project was a proposed
experiment on the mechanics of delivery substances (in this case roughly a bath full of tap water) to the atmosphere by
balloon and hose [42].


— There is a significant risk that a moratorium on outdoors projects would stigmatize
geoengineering research. While some campaigners undoubtedly would see this as a
desirable outcome, the fact remains that SRM may be able to reduce some of the worst
risks of a warming planet while humanity makes the transition to a low carbon world. Healthy scepticism over SRM is to be welcomed, creation of a taboo is not.

— A moratorium risks premature rejection of SRM, where a potentially useful technology
is prevented from research and development by inflexible social and political factors
[45]. How long would we be prepared to delay safe outdoors research in order to get
(additional) international agreement?
