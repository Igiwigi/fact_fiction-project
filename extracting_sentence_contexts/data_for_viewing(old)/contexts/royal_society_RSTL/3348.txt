FoR everal years I have been engaged in a series of experiments, in the hope of in-
creasing the power of the telescope, and I am induced, perhaps rather prematurely,
to lay some account of them before the Royal Society, conceiving that, from the scale
upon which they have been carried on, and perhaps from their results, they may
prove interesting, particularly to those who have devoted their attention to 8uch 8ub-
jects. I should have been glad to have postponed this communication to a more di-
stant time, 80 as to have rendered it in many respects more complete, but as experi-
ments on a large scale are necessarily very tedious (months, even years, passing away
almost imperceptibly), to have done 80 would have been to have postponed it inde-
finitely, and to have withheld facts which may perhaps be useful to those who are
engaged in similar pursuits.

All the experiments I am about to describe relate solely to the Reflecting Tele-
scope. With the exception of a few trifling experiments many years ago on fluid
object-glasses, which led to no result, I bave not had any experience in the construe-
tion of the refractor.

I have long thought that in the present state of knowledge there was not much
prospect of improving the refractor to any considerable extent ; the fluid object-glass,
at least in my hands, did not appear promising, and the improvements which have
been made in the manufacture of glass on the continent, seem to have effected little
more than to afford the means of constructing larger discs of tolerably perfect glass,
