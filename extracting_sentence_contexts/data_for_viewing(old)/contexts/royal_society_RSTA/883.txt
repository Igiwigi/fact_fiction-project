in accordance with the topological charge of the nodes found above from the spin texture.

5. Phase diagram

The spin texture and the Fermi arc surface states presented above unambiguously established
the existence of pairs of Weyl nodes in SM periodic structures. We have systematically scanned
the parameter space of this model and the resultant phase diagram is shown in figure 7. Most
strikingly, one observes a series of lobes (light grey regions, W}) that feature single pairs of Weyl

nodes, similar to those shown in the left panel of figure 2. Approximately, each lobe appears when : 2
kpd = nz (n â‚¬ Z) and vz > A. The dark black regions (W2) represent phases with two pairs of Weyl [=
nodes. They also appear as a regular array but are well separated from each other and much S
smaller in area compared to W. In fact, W2 can be viewed as the overlapping regions of two : 2
adjacent W phases, as seen in the inset of figure 7, which shows the details near d/ = 10. In the : &
rest of the phase diagram (white regions, Wo), the spectrum is gapped, even though the gap may ih
be numerically small (see, for example, the spectrum at point A shown in the first subpanel). : S

The evolution of the spectrum along a vertical cut in the phase diagram, from point A to point D8
E, is illustrated in the subpanels of figure 7. As vz is increased at this particular value of d, the : ea
lowest branch of the spectrum is pushed down by the increasing Zeeman splitting to touch E = 0, 1g

entering the W2 phase (AB). With further increase of vz, the newly born pair of Weyl nodes
with opposite charges become increasingly detached from each other, with one heading towards
k, =0 and the other towards the BZ boundary. The latter gets gapped out once it reaches the BZ
boundary where it annihilates with its mirror image living on the negative kz-axis, thus marking
