In 1866 MAGxvs varied his method of experiment, seeking to solve the question of
absorption by observations on radiation. ©T have,” he says, © made a few determina-
tions of the radiation of dry and moist air, and of some other gases and vapours. Up
to the present time,” he continues, © the capacity of these bodies to transmit heat has
alone been determined.” + He then describes his arrangement :—* The gases and

vapours were passed through a brass tube of 15 millimeters internal diameter,
