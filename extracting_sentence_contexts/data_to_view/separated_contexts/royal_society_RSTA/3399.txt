Physicists are not verifying their personal beliefs about their observations
but searching for a mathematical abstract description allowing them to explain and to predict in

a quantitative way physical phenomena observed and those to be discovered. These laws do not : =
depend on the existence and on the presence of human agents. : S

Of course we perceive the surrounding world by our senses and we probe it using : 2
experimental devices constructed by us. If our senses and brains were different, we would 14
probably grasp different aspects of this world if we were able to do it. : _

It is amazing that the laws of Nature we were able to discover and the theories we constructed :4
allow us to produce new materials, cure diseases and explore the Solar System and beyond. : =
Perhaps our success is due to the fact that our senses and brains are the product of evolution 13
which has been governed by the laws of Nature which we were able only to discover in recent : S
centuries. These laws of Nature governed physical phenomena long before Homo sapiens started their
quest for the explanation. Stars were created and vanished, tectonic plates were moving, planets
were orbiting around the Sun, seasons and tides were changing periodically.
