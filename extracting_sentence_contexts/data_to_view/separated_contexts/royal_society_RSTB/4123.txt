are closed by a coating of vaseline, while the intercellular spaces are connected with
the outer air by cutting the lamina into strips. In this way the well-known fact of

been used throughout my work. The transpiration of a greased and slit leaf has also been used for investigating the
direct effect of light on transpiration.*
