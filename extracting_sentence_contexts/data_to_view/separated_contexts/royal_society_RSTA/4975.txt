as it is well known that they are. The fact that a neutral molecule,
y HCl, dissociates so that the sume element H is always positive, may possibly be
tibed to the catalytic action of the solvent without whose aid the splitting up
â€˜ould not occur. When the solvent is water, or it may be for a gaseous body merely
s of moisture, the decomposition is produced by the formation of an aggregate
With the water-molecules which splits easily in only one way; but when the solvent
8 changed, the characters of the charges of the ions might be inverted, as in fact
Sometimes occurs. 40. If we consider a molecule to be made up of, or to involve, a steady configuration
revolving electrons, it will follow that every disturbance of this steady motion will
nyolve radiation and consequent loss of energy.
