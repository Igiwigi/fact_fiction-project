190 DRS. A. MATTHIESSEN AND C. VOGT ON THE INFLUENCE OF

The values in Table XIX. indicate that the law will probably hold good for most of
the three metal alloys.

There is, however, one of the three metal alloys which we cannot pass over unnoticed,
namely, that of copper-nickel-zinc or argentan (german silver). This alloy has long
been used, on account of the small effect which temperature has on its conducting-power,
for making resistance coils, &c. It is a somewhat curious fact, that the conducting-
power of this commercial alloy decreases less between 0? and 100? than almost any other
alloy yet known, for in the course of this investigation we have only found the following
which show a smaller percentage decrement in their conducting-power than argentan.

'The conducting-power of the platinum-silver alloy, containing 19:65 volumes per cent.
platinum, decreases between 0* and 100” 3:10 per cent.

The conducting-power of the palladium-silyer alloy, containing 23-38 yolumes per cent.
palladium, decreases between 0* and 100* 3:40 per cent. |

The conducting-power of the iron-gold alloy, containing 10-96 yolumes per cent. iron,
decreases between 0* and 100? 3:84 per cent.
