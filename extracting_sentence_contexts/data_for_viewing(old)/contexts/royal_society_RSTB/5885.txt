predominated in the Neanderthal race as it does in Pithecanthropus, and apes.

The survival of this more primitive arrangement in some races may, however, be due
to the fact that just as in primitive man the skull form is a rather long one, which
seems to favour this condition as it favours the simpler course of the Sylvian and
temporal sulci.

In meso- and brachy-hypsicephalic both conditions are less frequent, although the simpler midfrontal
also occurs with such races.+

But on the other hand the tendency of the midfrontal sulcus to split up into pieces,
and to lose its connection with the precentral in general, may have to do with the
evolution of the frontal lobe as appears from the fact that this sulcus and its homologue,
the horizontal branch of the arcuate, are so constant even in brachycephalic apes.

To explain from an evolutionary viewpoint the fragmentation of this sulcus in most
recent races we have to consider the cytotectonic and physiological development of
this lobe.

The gradual more caudal extension of the lower part of the frontal area in monkeys,
apes and man, as evidenced by the caudal displacement of the inferior frontal and orbital
operculum, is confirmed by the cytotectonic researches of all who worked in this field
(CAMPBELL, BropMann, Mort, the Voats and their school).

If we admit that the value of the inferior precentral as a limiting sulcus of the frontal
