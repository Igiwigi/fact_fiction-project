Of course, as we saw earlier, more modes creep in the vicinity when
the effect of viscosity is reduced. As a case in point near the 5 Hz location, we have three modes
in the inviscid case, i.e. (1,1), (5,1) and (2,2), but only one survives, i.e. (1,1), when viscosity
is added, this being the least choppy one. In fact, near the frequency of 4.5 Hz, a choppier but
harmonic mode, (1,2) that is slightly more stable is depicted and is forecast from table 2. The
closeness of the modes makes it difficult to discern the behaviour when modes are close to one
another. A second observation is that the peaks of the curve represent the transition of one modal
