For
the interferometric geometric phase, the phase factor is —1 for odd numbers of revolutions in the
Brillouin zone and +1 for even numbers, no matter what the temperature is. This means that the
interferometric phase does not detect any phase transition in temperature, but it detects the same
phase transition as the Berry phase for pure states, i.e. at 1 = 1. In fact, it extends the Berry phase
to finite temperature in a way that captures the periodicity of the state of the Kitaev chain. For
p(k) given by equation (3.4), modelling pure states if T=0 and mixed states if T > 0 induces a
homomorphism between the fundamental groups of the Brillouin zone with endpoints identified
and the equatorial plane punctured at the maximally mixed state. Both of these groups equal
the group of integers, Z, and the homomorphism is n — dn where d is the degree of the Bloch
vector. (Thus, d = 1 if m <1 and d=0 if m > 1.) We can extend this with a second homomorphism
Z— Zp sending n to ei”.
