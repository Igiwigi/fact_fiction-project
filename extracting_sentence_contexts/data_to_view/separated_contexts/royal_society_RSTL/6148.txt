It is perhaps scarcely necessary to consider the
former hypothesis, according to which, oxygen, in its ordinary state, would be a mecha-
nical mixture, as atmospheric air is a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen. The contraction,


VOLUMETRIC RELATIONS OF OZONE. 129

which occurs when the electrical discharge is passed through oxygen, is at first Sight
indeed fayourable to such a supposition, inasmuch as the combination of gases is usually
accompanied either by a diminution, or no change of volume. But we have not been
able to discover, in its other reactions, any facts which countenance this otherwise
improbable view of the constitution of oxygen gas. Finally, it remains to be considered, whether in the formation of ozone, oxygen does
not undergo a more profound molecular change than is involved in an allotropic modifi-
cation, whether, in short, this supposed element may not be actually decomposed. If,
for the moment, we confine our attention to the phenomena which present themselves
when the electrical discharge is passed through oxygen, this attractive hypothesis will
be found to furnish a simple and plansible explanation of them all.
