Remarkable as this independent discovery of a “ rostro-carinate” flint implement
is, it is paralleled both by that (specimen B) which led Sir ArrHur Evans to call it
to mind and by the discovery of another, more highly finished than any yet known,

also not obtained from the Pre-Crag horizon. This beautiful little implement
(specimen C, text-figs. 6 and 7, and Plate 14, C, C) was obtained by Mr. Morr from
the Mid-Glacial sands which overlie the Red Crag in Messrs. Bolton and Laughlin’s
pit. It is more minutely chipped than are any of the Pre-Crag specimens, and is ot
a perfected hook-beaked form, facts which may suggest that it is the work of a later
