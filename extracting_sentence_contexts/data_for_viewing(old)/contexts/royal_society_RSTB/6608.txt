a number of small plates. Hawkins and Hampton (1927, p. 593) state, ‘our opinion
is that the structure is a true apical system enclosing the periproct, that it is definitely
on the adapical surface, and that its polar position is indicated and excentricity not

proved”. Their drawing (fig. 6B), however, is not like any apical system known.
The facts seem to be that these authors are right in saying that the structure is on the
adapical surface, but wrong in describing it either as a complete apical system or
as polar in position. The small plates are probably only a part of the apical system
analogous with the valve plates of Ectinechinus and Aulechinus. Palaeodiscus may have
had the same “irregularity” as Ectinechinus.

Tue Corona OF BOTH GENERA

The corona in both genera consists of relatively wide interambulacra and narrow
ambulacra. The general imbrication agrees with that of other thin-walled Palaeozoic
Echinoidea, that is, the interambulacrals overlap each other by their adapical and
adradial margins, the ambulacrals by their adoral margins. It is of interest to note
that Asterozoa with flexible skeletons obey the same rules. Laterally the inter-
