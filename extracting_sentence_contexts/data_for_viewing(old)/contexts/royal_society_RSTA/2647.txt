impregnated surfaces is accompanied by the migration of the lubricant from the wetting ridge
and from within the textured substrate to the surface of frozen droplets [67]. For practical
applications, this mechanism can comprise the self-healing and frost-repelling characteristics of
lubricant-impregnated surfaces, regardless of the underlying substrate’s topography [67]. Thus,
it was concluded that further research is necessary to develop liquid-texture pairs that will
provide a sustainable frost suppression method [67]. Drag reduction by lubricant-infused surfaces
was demonstrated [68]. Anti-microbial properties of oil-infused surfaces were reported [30].
Topography of micro-rough surfaces impregnated with ferro-fluids may be effectively controlled
by magnetic fields [33].

9. Electrowetting of lubricated surfaces

Electrowetting of lubricated surfaces is of special interest to engineers, due to the fact that it allows
diminishing of the voltage U necessary for actuating a droplet [69-71]. Indeed, when a droplet
is placed on an impregnated (infused) solid surface, the triple line is de-pinned (as discussed
in §§5 and 6), which facilitates its displacement under applied voltage. Consider the wetting
regime depicted in figure 2a where oil completely coats a water droplet. Minimization of the free
energy of a droplet G [41] yields the value of the apparent contact angle 6* (shown in figure 2a,
consider that the definition and measurement of the apparent contact angle in the case of oil-
infused surfaces is far from trivial due to the wetting ridge) and the following dependence of 6*
on the applied voltage U:
