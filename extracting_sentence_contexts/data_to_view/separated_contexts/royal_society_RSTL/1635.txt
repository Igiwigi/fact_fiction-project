times following, with the same quantity of salt. I mention the

attetnpting an explanation-of it.. It may perhaps be said, that
as the water evaporates, the affinity of the subsilicated fluat for
Silex increases. ;

Subsilicated fluat of ammonia is decomposed by the sulphu=
ric acid, and by muriatic acid gas, and also by the fixed alkalies
and by ammonia,

Sulphuric acid expels from it, silicated fluoric gas and- hy-
drated fluoric acid fumes,

Muriatic acid gas acts slowly on it, and effects its decoms
position apparently through the medium of its water. A little
of the crystalline salt was introduced into muriatic acid gas in
a jar over mercury.
