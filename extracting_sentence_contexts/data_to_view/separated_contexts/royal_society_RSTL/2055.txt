By covering fine wires with glass or other insu-
lating substances,and then removing only 80 much matter as to expose the point,
or a section of the wires, and by passing electricity through two such wires, the
guarded points of which were immersed in water, WoLLasToN found that the
water could be decomposed even by the current from the machine, without
sparks, and that two streams of gas arose from the points, exactly resembling,
in appearance, those produced by yoltaic electricity, and, like the latter, giving
a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen gases. But Dr. WorLLasTox himself points
out that the effect is different from that of the voltaic pile, inasmuch as both
oxygen. and hydrogen are evolved from each pole; he calls it © a very close
imitation of the galvanic phenomena,” but adds, that © in fact the resemblance
is not complete,” and does not trust to it to establish the principles, correctly
laid down in his paper. 328. This experiment is neither more nor less than a repetition, in a refined
manner, of that made by Dr. Pzarson in 1797*, and previously by MM.
Pagers Van TroosTwyK and Deiman in 1789 or earlier.
