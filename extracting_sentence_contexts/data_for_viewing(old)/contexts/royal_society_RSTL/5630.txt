The next column represents the amount of change of refractive index which the
substance exhibits, for each 5® of temperature. For this change the term sensitiveness is
proposed. The difference is evidently uniform, or nearly 80, the irregularities being
within the limits of errors of observation. Tt is reckoned from the indices of the line D,
as that line very nearly represents the point, of mean refraction in the spectrum, and a
glance will suffice to show that were it reckoned for either A or H, the ayerage would

be somewhat different, the whole amount of difference of refraction between 0* C. and
42% C. being for A, 00317, for D, 00360, and for H, 00397. This fact is exhibited,
though under another form, in the sueceeding column, where the refractive index for A
is subtracted from that for IH; and as these lines are at the two extremities of the
prismatic image, py—p, represents the measureable length of the spectrum. It evidently
decreases as the temperature rises.

The last column gives the dispersive power at the different temperatures, that is, the
