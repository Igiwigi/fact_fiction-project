Egypt, where I was for three months in 1874-75, I often remarked upon the depth of
Shadows of the rocks of the Lybian range, distant some three miles from my station ;
“ut the shadows in the Oberland Alps, lying some twenty miles ur more away, were
n this occasion even darker, showing that the haze caused by dust, which is always
nore or less prevalent in Egypt, was almost absent. The presumable absence of
Svater particles as well as of dust on my days of observation at the Riffel made the
‘Eutmosphere clearer than it was in Egypt even under the most favourable conditions,
Al am not stating this only from recollection, but I have records of the fact in photo-
graphs which I took at the time at both places. This state of the atmosphere lasted,
as I have said, till the afternoon, when a battle for supremacy was waged between the
north wind and the wind coming over from the Italian side of the range. The sky
then became more or less hazy, and the observations of sunlight were discontinued.
The sky at mid-day, as I have said, was of a blue-black, and in fact, with a pocket
spectroscope, the spectrum could barely be seen. On a previous occasion, when photo-
graphing the sky spectrum at the same place, and, as far as can be judged, under
precisely the same conditions, the exposure necessary to give to the plate was at
least some seven or eight times that required in England to obtain similar results,

light. I think, for observations on visible radiation, such a locality as I selected in th
Alps is preferable to one of equal altitude in a warmer climate. In Professo:
