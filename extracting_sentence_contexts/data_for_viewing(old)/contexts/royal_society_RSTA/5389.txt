In both individual plays and larger regions (petroleum basins), the majority of oil resources tend
to be located within a small number of large accumulations. For example, although there are up
to 70000 producing oil fields in the world, around 500 giant and supergiant fields account for
two-thirds of all the oil that has ever been discovered [4]. As discussed later, this basic physical
characteristic of oil resources is of critical importance for future supply.

Oil resources are commonly classified into different categories on the basis of physical oil
and rock properties, extraction technology or location, but there are inconsistencies in the
terminology used. Figure 2 summarizes our classification, while box 1 expands upon these
definitions. We define conventional oil as crude oil, condensate and NGLs and non-conventional
oil as tight oil, extra-heavy oil, oil sands and kerogen oil. Since tight oil is similar in chemical
composition to crude oil (while the other non-conventional oils are not), it could equally be
classified as conventional. We classify it as non-conventional here, to emphasize the fact that
tight oil is a new and rapidly growing source of liquid fuels that was historically excluded
from conventional oil resource estimates and production forecasts. Tight oil also differs from
conventional oil in both the geological characteristics of the resource and the methods of
production.

The core issue for future supply is the extent and the rate of depletion of conventional oil,
since this currently provides around 95% of global all-liquids supply. Options for mitigating this
depletion include:

— substituting conventional oil with non-conventional oil;

— substituting all-oil with other non-conventional liquids (gas-to-liquids, coal-to-liquids
