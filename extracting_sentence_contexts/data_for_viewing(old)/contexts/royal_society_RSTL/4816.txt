glass tubes of between three and four feet in length, which were sealed before the
blowpipe after the substances had been introduced.

The erystalline mass produced in this reaction readily dissolves even in cold water.
If the iodide was in excess this substance separates in heavy oily globules, which
may be readily separated and recovered by distillation, and the solution is inodorous,
and either neutral or very slightly acid; in the latter case it has always a marked
yellowish tint. On the other hand, if the base was in excess, the solution of the
crystals was colourless and alkaline ; the alkaline reaction disappears however on ebul-
lition, triethylamine being disengaged. The crystals are likewise s0luble in alcohol,
but almost insoluble in ether.

The purification of the crystals is not attended with any difficulties; it is in fact
sufficient to dissolve them in cold water and to allow the solution to evaporate spon-
taneously, when beautiful well-defined white crystals of considerable size are depo-
Sited, which may be easily separated by mechanical means, from small quantities of
a reddish iodine-compound, which is sometimes formed by the action of the air. This
latter substance is formed in much larger quantity at higher temperatures, wherefore
it is advisable to avoid the use of boiling water in the purification.

The erystals are anhydrous; when exposed to the temperature of boiling water
they exhibit no change in weight. When snbmitted to analysis they gave the follow-
ing results :â€”

I. 0:4385 grm. of substance gave 06015 grm. of carbonic acid and 0:3040 grm. of
