In the case of KCl and NaCl, equation (8) may be written in the form
BSB BN ct depo, (LE),

which is the relation between the hydration numbers and the migration numbers, and
equation (10) gives us

ty = N,+N,(B,—-B)(B+h*)* . 2. 2 1. (12),

There arises thus from our theory a simple linear relation between the series of
Hittorf numbers n, for an electrolyte and the corresponding series of values of
(B+h*)".. We shall see that this in fact holds, and that equation (12) gives us a
ready means for obtaining N,, the value of the Hittorf numbers at infinite dilution, a
quantity of great importance in the theory of electrolytes. (b) Deduction of Constant for NaCl— In the former paper it was shown that in
the ease of KCl the function @ was of the form & = Bh7**, and that the value of B
was 3°33.
