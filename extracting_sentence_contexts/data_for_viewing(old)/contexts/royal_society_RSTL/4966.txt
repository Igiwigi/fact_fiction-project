had not yet disappeared, but which had become very indistinct, as if in a state of
difluence. At the end of sizty hours I could no longer detect any trace of them.
The egg that was the subject of these observations proceeded regularly in its changes,
and ultimately produced the embryo; all the stages of which I have traced and
delineated for future communication to the Royal Society.

Subsequently to these observations I saw ova passed by another female, Lissotriton
palmipes, and on submitting these to the same close examination as the above, within
five minutes after their production, I again found what I regarded as the remains of
spermatozoa on the surface of the egg-covering, but not a trace of any in the in-
terior or in the vicinity of the yelk.

Endosmosis of the envelopes during impregnation. â€”But although the facts now
mentioned are 80 opposed to the view that the spermatozoa penetrate bodily into the
ovum, it is due to the distinguished observers to whom I have referred to enter s0me-
what more fully into the questions which their observations involve ; and while 1 am
free to admit the possibility of mistake or oversight on my part, to mention the
details of 8ome experiments made expressly with the view to ascertain whether the
envelopes of the ovum of the Frog are permeable in any part to solid particles of
matter; or whether there exists any orifice in them by which such particles can enter.
It is well known that during the transit of the oyum through the oviduet the vitellary
membrane becomes invested with a thick gelatinous covering, the first thick layer of
which may be regarded as the rudimentary chorion, and perhaps may be analogous
in its function, in some respects, as it seeins to be in its place and mode of origin, to
