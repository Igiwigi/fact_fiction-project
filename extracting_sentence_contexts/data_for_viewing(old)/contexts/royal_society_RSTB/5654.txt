The equation for the reaction between pyruvic alcohol and alkaline iodine is similar
to that for the reaction with acetone except that glycollic acid is formed in place of
acetic acid. It is therefore,

CH, .CO.CH,OH + 61 + 4 NaOH = CHI, + CH,OH . COONa + 3Nal + 3H,0.

Summary.

A method is described (p. 140) for the quantitative estimation of kojic acid (5-hydroxy-
2-hydroxymethyl-y-pyrone) which depends on the fact that kojic acid is quantitatively
decomposed by alkaline iodine solution under experimental conditions which have been
determined and of which details are given.

The equation of this reaction has been established (p. 141) and the mechanism by
which the reaction takes place has been determined (p. 148).
