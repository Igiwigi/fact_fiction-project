The formation of extrasolar clouds and their time-
variability has first been analysed in brown dwarf atmospheres [10-12], which are repeatedly
studied as exoplanet analogues [13]. Complex models have been developed for brown dwarf and
planetary atmospheres, their chemical composition and the clouds that form [14-18]. In fact, clouds have been found to be quite frustrating as they are blocking our view into the
extrasolar and chemically very different atmospheres of exoplanets where one might hope to find

the signature of biomolecules or the precursors thereof. Because the atmospheric chemistry of :ยง
exoplanets (and brown dwarfs) is very different to Earth, the clouds that form are not made of i>
water only, but are made of a mix of minerals and oxides in the hotter exoplanets in addition : =
to water or methane clouds in cooler exoplanets and brown dwarfs [19]. Although the Solar : 3S
System gas planet atmospheres appear less dynamic compared with some of the extrasolar gas 3
giants, lightning events are detected directly in the cloudy atmospheres of Earth, Jupiter and :8
Saturn, are debatable for Venus, and indirectly inferred for Neptune and Uranus.
