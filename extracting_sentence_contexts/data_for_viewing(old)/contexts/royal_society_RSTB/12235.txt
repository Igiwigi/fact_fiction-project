for which we see ample evidence in the early ethnographic
texts we coded (see electronic supplementary material, Note 8).
Second, while our evidence suggests that Murdock was correct
in thinking that reverse transitions are comparatively rare, the lit-
erature we have reviewed above, along with our own findings,
suggest that in the ethnographic record Murdock (and we) exam-
ined, the game of transition was rigged in favour of transitions

away from matriliny and against transitions towards it. Moreover,
the unique historical conditions of the past few hundred years are
likely not representative of most of human history, raising the
question of whether we would expect to see similar patterns of
the rarity of ‘reverse’ transitions in other time periods. In fact,
we expect that at different points in human history we would
not see the same pattern.

Our findings also suggest that transitions may be flexible
in response to environmental conditions, even in the short
term, supporting the idea that ecological shifts, rather than
general or unilineal evolutionary trends, underlie transitions
both away from and towards matriliny. For example, Herlihy
[87] describes a case in which a descent system has been
observed to transition in both directions:
