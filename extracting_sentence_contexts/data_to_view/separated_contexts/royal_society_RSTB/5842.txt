I, appeared to
occupy approximately its normal position in the six experiments in which it was joined
to I,a so far as could be judged from its contacts with the older leaves P, and P,, though
it may sometimes have been very slightly displaced in the anodic direction by La. The angle I,a-I, was therefore considerably less than the normal on account of the
displacement of I,a towards I,, its highest value being 113Â° (see Table I). In No. 1
indeed, I, was noticeably displaced in the anodic direction, and this was no doubt due
to the fact that in this experiment I,a arose before I, and occupied part of the area which
I, would normally have occupied. The angle I,a-I, in this experiment is thus slightly
larger than in the other six, but still considerably less than the normal. I, appeared to be slightly displaced towards the wound in all seven experiments.
