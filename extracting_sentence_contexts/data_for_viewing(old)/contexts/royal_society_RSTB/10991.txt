and the Calvinâ€”Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle.

The second mode is heterotrophy, in which algae grow in
the absence of light by fermentation or respiration of exo-
genous sugars [7]. Among the diatom heterotrophs, two
different categories can be recognized: (i) obligate heterotrophs
(e.g. Nitzschia alba) that lack photosynthetic pigments and are
thus not able to perform photosynthesis and (ii) facultative het-
erotrophs (e.g. Cyclotella cryptica) that can separately perform
photosynthesis and respiration. C. cryptica is able to grow in
the presence of glucose in the dark, but displays lower pro-
ductivity than when operating in the photoautotrophic mode
[8]. In fact, some microalgae are obligate photoautotrophs
because of an inefficient uptake of carbon (reviewed in [9]).
In keeping with this observation, it was shown that introduc-
tion of the gene encoding for the human glucose transporter
(GLUT1) in P. tricornutum allowed the uptake of glucose in
the dark, thereby improving biomass production [10]. A
third mode of cultivation is mixotrophy, i.e. the growth in the
presence of both light and organic carbon. This mode, which
involves the utilization of respiration and photosynthesis sim-
ultaneously, is of particular interest to understand how the two
major systems of energy metabolism harboured by plants and
algae interact with one another. Various diatoms including
P. tricornutum [11] and Navicula saprophila, and some species
