EWART ON THE ASCENT OF WATER IN TREES. 359

and convey water to the tissue of the developing apex in the opposite direction
to normal flow. Further, the increase of diameter of the wood elements of a tree as
it grows older, which may amount to a quarter or one-third of their original size, is
supposed to aid in the transference of flow to the newer wood. Srraspurcer fails
to see, however, that a higher retentivity at the ends of the bundles would operate
against the transference of water to the mesophyll, whereas a ready transference is
what the plant needs, and in fact the narrowing of the diameter of the wood
elements merely enables the bundle endings to be finer and more numerous and
gives a relatively greater surface to the elements themselves for the outward
passage of water. Furthermore, under normal conditions the flow of water in the
first formed wood elements of the root apex is towards the stem, just as in other
parts of the root, since the absorption through the root-cap is greater than the
amount used locally in growth. This is all that needs to be made good, since there
is no loss by transpiration in ordinary moist soil.
