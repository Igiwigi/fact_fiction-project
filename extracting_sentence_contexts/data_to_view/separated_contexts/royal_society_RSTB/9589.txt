Although the path of cargo is thus unclear, the narrow
diameter of both the injectisome needle* and the flagellar © vw
filament (20-25 A, accommodating a maximum of one 2
to two a-helices) [211,212] means that proteins travelling Ss
through these appendages will have to be at least partially ©
unfolded prior to export [213]. In agreement with this  <
assumption, very stably folded artificial T3SS substrates
such as ubiquitin, GST or GFP were shown to be rejected
by the export machinery [214,215] or even block the machin-
ery in the cases of fusions to the ruler protein [216]. A recent
study exploited this fact to visualize a trapped export sub-
strate in the injectisome needle [208] and showed that
presence of this substrate leads to distinct conformational
changes within the basal body. The main player in unfolding the substrate (and the con-
current removal of the chaperone) is the ATPase [215], which
has been shown in many studies to engage with effectors
and/or their chaperones. Recent structural data showed
that some effector/chaperone complexes can form hexamers,
which would fit the hexameric ATPase structure [217].
