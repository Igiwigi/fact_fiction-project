An interesting parallel might, indeed, be instituted between the principle of
the reflex function and that of the irritability, in regard to their history and
degree of importance : their history is the same; for both had been con-
founded with sensation and voluntary motion*: their importance is precisely
the same; for each presides over its own distinct order of functions. Lecairos plainly mistook the reflex function of the medulla for the principle
of sensation and voluntary motion; and no physiologist has distinguished its
agency, in the function of the larynx and of the sphincters, from the influence
of the brain, or from irritability. The view of M. CruvernmR, that the me-
dulla spinalis is a mere neryous chord, is at variance with all the facts and
experiments detailed in the course of this paper. It is obviously from the mistake which has been pointed out, that Lecarrors
experienced the difficulty expressed in the following words : Â© Comment se
