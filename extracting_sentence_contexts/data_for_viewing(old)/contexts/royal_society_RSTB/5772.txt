between the entoconid and hypoconid. TxmHarp figures three crests on the hypoco-
nulid and mentions one as the antero-external ; this appears to be the central one in his
figure corresponding to what is here called the anterior arm in text-fig. 2. The outer one
in his figure which runs down to the outer base of the hypoconid cannot be traced in
the present specimen. The posterior arm curves round to the inner side and is flat
and not well marked, but on its way down to the base of the entoconid shows a very
small corrugation of the enamel which is all that can be said to represent the second
talonid cusp. It can hardly be seen with the naked eye and the statement therefore
that a double talonid cusp is a generic character of Hyracotherium is not correct. As
for the rest of the tooth it is only necessary to state that the anterior crest of the hypo-
conid runs down to a point midway between the protoconid and mesoconid as in TEIL-
HARDâ€™S figure of Propachynolophus, which the present specimen resembles more than it
does his figure of Hyracotherium. A comparison of the two lower molars in fact helps
to show that there is very little, if any, difference between these two genera. The
molars of H. cuniculus which are described later are a little different.

Hyracotherium vulpiceps. (Figs. 4, 5, Plate 51.)

The Abbey Wood specimen.

This specimen is, on the whole, nearer H. vulpiceps than H. leporinum, but differs
from both in its rather smaller size in length of the tooth row as well as in the breadth
of the teeth. The lower teeth show a similar reduction in length and breadth.

The third upper premolar is interesting in that it has more the shape of the corre-
