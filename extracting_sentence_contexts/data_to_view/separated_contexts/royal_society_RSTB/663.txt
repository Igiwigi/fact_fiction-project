It is now neces-
sary to turn to the question whether it may not be possible to obtain increments of
E.M.F. as a result of excitation. Excitatory electrical variations in glandular structures have long been known. VALENTIN (19), in 1861, and Rorper (20), in 1869, demonstrated the fact for the
skin of the Frog. Hermann and Lucusiycer (21), in 1878, did the same in the case
of the tongue glands of the Frog and the sweat glands of the paw of the Cat, Lucu-
SINGER (22), in 1880, in the glands of the snout of the Pig, Goat, and Cat, and
Bayxiss and Braprorp (16), in 1887, in the salivary glands of the Cat and Dog. The case of the skin of the Frog has been more frequently examined than the others,
but the results have proved most conflicting at the hands of the several observers

â€œThe conditions here which appear to affect the nature of the electrical variation upon
excitation of the cutaneous nerves are numerous.
