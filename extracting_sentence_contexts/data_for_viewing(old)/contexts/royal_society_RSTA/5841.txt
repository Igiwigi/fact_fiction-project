diverse features of string theory and quantum gravity,
theoretical cosmology is in fact the most obvious ‘testing
agent’ for many of the most advanced, pioneering or
e-mail: effemov-ap@rudn.ru speculative ideas in these fields.

Mathematical cosmology has acquired a unique
status, potential and independence as a scientific field.
It reveals its own problems, methods and techniques,
often with the stimulus of general relativity, quantum
field theory and above all differential geometry, but it
also serves as the inevitable tank of ideas and models for
use of the more data-driven, ‘actual’ physical cosmology.
In fact, mathematical theoretical cosmology provides the
driving force behind modern attempts to explain the—
now manifold—observational cosmology data.

We believe that this theme issue will be useful as a
lasting guide and reference for interested people entering
the field, as well as for experienced researchers who seek
to expand their field of vision in this most majestic of
scientific enterprises.
