and micro examinations.

Group “ D” contains forged bars similar to those in group “ C,” though generally
somewhat more regular in their rectangular section. ‘The specimens are, however,
distinguished by having one or more sides polished. Here we seem to have some relics
of Farapay’s efforts in the direction of obtaining alloys suitable for mirrors. Specimen

No. 39/D.12 was, in fact, specially noticeable for the excellent mirror polish which it
possessed, in no way diminished after this lapse of time.

The specimen originally selected from the contents of the box for a preliminary
examination, prior to the investigation of the remaining 78, comes into this category
“DP.” Like No. 39/D.12 it had, in fact, a high mirror polish on one side, and was
also closely similar in its cross-sectional dimensions. For this reason it was allocated
the author’s Research number 39), and group number D.12.

author will have occasion to refer to this specimen in more detail later.
