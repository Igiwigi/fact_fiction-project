Of the two values obtained by the tape method, the first measurement was made
before the magnetic measurements, and for fear of damaging the insulation of the

wire no attempt was made to smooth down any slight roughness produced by the
shellac varnish having stiffened projecting filaments of the silk covering of the wire.
Before the second set, however, such roughness was removed by lightly rubbing the
surface of the coil with a smooth piece of brass. Hence the fact that the first
measurements gave a larger value for the radius is not to be wondered at.

The radius below the first layer was in the same way measured by the two
methods. The individual measurements of the diameters are given in the following
