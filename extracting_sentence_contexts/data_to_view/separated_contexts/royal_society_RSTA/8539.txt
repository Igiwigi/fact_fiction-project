The theoretical deduction—that rupture of an isotropic elastic material always
occurs at a certain maximum tension—is doubtless correct ; but in ordinary tensile
and other tests designed to secure uniform stress, the stress is actually far from uniform
so that the average stress at rupture is much below the true strength of the material. Now it may be shown, with the help of elastic theory, that the stress must be
substantially uniform, in such tests, unless the material of the test-pieces is heterogeneous
or discontinuous. It is known that all substances are in fact discontinuous, in that
they are composed of molecules of finite size, and it may be asked whether this type
of discontinuity is sufficient to account for the observed phenomena. With the help of formula (13) above, this question may be answered in the negative. Formula (13) shows that a thin plate of glass, having in it the weakest possible crack of
length 2c¢ inch, will break at a tension, normal to the crack, of not less than 266)./c Ibs.
