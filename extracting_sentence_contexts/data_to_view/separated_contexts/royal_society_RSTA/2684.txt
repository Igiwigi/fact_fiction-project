Tue question of the mode of variation of the specific heat of water is so fundamental
in calorimetry, there are so few experiments between 50° C. and 100° C., and the
results in this region obtained by different observers are so discordant, that no
apology is needed for the publication of new experimental work tending to throw
light: on the subject. But in order to elucidate the points at issue, it will first be
necessary to review briefly the experimental evidence already in existence, and to
exhibit the results graphically as an indication of the order of accuracy of the various
methods. A minor difficulty in comparing the results of different observers arises from the
fact that they are expressed in terms of different thermometric scales and units, and
that the reduction to a uniform standard of comparison cannot always be effected
with certainty. Throughout the present paper, for reasons which have been fully
explained elsewhere, all heat quantities are expressed in terms of the specific heat of
water at 20° C. taken as unity. The scale of temperature, ¢, adopted is that deduced
from the temperature pt by platinum resistance thermometer by means of the difference
