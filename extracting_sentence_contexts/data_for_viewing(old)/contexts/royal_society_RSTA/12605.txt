The numbers of days “2” in columns n+27 and n+28 exceed those in columns n—2
and n+2, and simply tower over the numbers in columns n+3 to +24. The relative
prominence of the character “2” figures in columns 1+27 and 7 +28 is even greater
for the two first 3-year periods in Table XIV. than for the 11-year period. In the
third or sunspot maximum group of years this prominence is less.

The number of days of character “1” is much less variable in Table XTV. than the
number of days of character “ 2.”
latter days there are so many the fewer available for other character figures. Thus
the number of days of character “1” is perhaps less instructive than the number of
disturbed days asa whole. This latter number subsides much less rapidly than it
rises in both the primary and secondary pulses. This presumably is a direct con-
sequence of the known fact that while a highly disturbed day often immediately
follows a quiet day, the converse is rare.

The fewness of quiet days in columns n +26 to +30 presents the 27—28-day period
in perhaps as striking a light as any.

When, however, there are a large number of the
