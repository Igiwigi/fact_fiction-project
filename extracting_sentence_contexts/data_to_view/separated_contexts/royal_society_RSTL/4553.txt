Lastly. I may observe,
that the law of disposition and polarization in some sort, though with modification,
affects the internal fringes as well as the external. It is a curious fact connected with polarization by inflexion, and which indeed is
only to be accounted for by that affection of light, that nothing else prevents the rays
from circulating round bodies exposed to them, at least bodies of moderate diameter. If the snccessive particles of the surface inflected, one particle acting after the other,
the rays must necessarily come round to the very point of the first flexion. We
$hould thus see a candle placed at A (fig. 22) when the eye was placed at B, because
the rays would be inflected all round; and even in parts of the earth where the sea
: is 8mooth, nothing but the small curvature of the surface could prevent us from
seeing the sun many hours after light had begun by placing the eye close to the
ground.
