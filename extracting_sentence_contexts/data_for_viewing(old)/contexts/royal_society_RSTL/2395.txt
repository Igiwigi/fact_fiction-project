is due to Mr. Poxp the Astronomer Royal, but was never published by him.
By means of five microscopes, raising the telescope from the Y's, turning the
circle 180? in azimuth, and repeating the observations, the angle is obtained
upon twenty different parts of the circle, without shifting the instrument, and
consequently any error of division may be supposed to be reduced to a very
small quantity. Employing in like manner three equidistant microscopes, the
angle is obtained by readings upon twelve different parts of the circle.

The second original microscope was not removed, and this afforded an
opportunity of comparing the angles obtained by two opposite microscopes,
with those deduced by means of five.

In the course of this work I remarked a curious fact, new to me, and for
which I was at a loss to account. In hazy weather when the staff was 80 faint
as to be only just visible, it disappeared upon bringing it to the intersection of
the cross wires, 80 that the angle could not be obseryed.

A remedy for this inconvenience was suggested and put in practice by Mr.
GarpxeR. The horizontal spider's web of the micrometer being moved above
the centre, Mr. Garpxg succeeded in lodging upon it a very minute particle
of dust. When the image of the staff was brought to this, it appeared as if
planted upon a mole-hill, and we were thus enabled to observe with great
