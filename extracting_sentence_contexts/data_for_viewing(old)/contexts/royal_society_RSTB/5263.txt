heterospory has not been proved. Prof. Bower (1923, p. 264) records it in Notholena affinis) and J, M‘L,
Tompson (1917, p. 161, figs. 12-14) figures in Platyzoma microphyllum spores of three different sizes. As

Prof. Bower (loc. cit.) states, “ These facts suggest initial heterospory, but they have not yet been tested by
cultivation of the prothalli.”

from leaves held above it, than for them to be blown over to that height from a
different plant, unless the latter was also a tree-fern. On the other hand, we have to
keep in view the possibility that some of the spores may belong to a vascular cryptogam
growing as an epiphyte upon the Clepsydropsis, a view suggested by certain facts
presently to be described.

(ii) Fungus (Plate 4, figs. 20, 21).—The intercellular mycelium of a fungus shown
in Plate 4, figs. 20, 21, was found in a stem in one of the Mt. Tangorin specimens
(specimen 2). Similar hyphe are of frequent occurrence in several other specimens.
It has not been possible to ascertain whether the mycelium is septate. No haustoria
have been recognised, but this may be due to the exigencies of preservation ; it is
therefore impossible to say whether the fungus was a parasite or a saprophyte.
Certainly, the presence of the fungus is not associated with hypertrophy or any other
kind of distortion in the tissues in which it is found.

Towards the top of fig. 20 (to the right) are seen a number of spherical bodies of
