In such animals as the Hog, in which this disposition is strongly de-
veloped, and aided by a special adaptation of the tarsal, and to some extent carpal, bones
to bring together the proximal extremities of the two middle digits, these two practically
work like the cannon of a Ruminant. Tn Hyopotamus, however, this disposition is
only indicated, while it is developed much better in Diplopus. The lateral digits of the Zyopotanmns are very well

b developed, and, in fact, besides the
Hippopotamus, we know of no animal in which they

: are 80 complete and relatively large
as in Hyopotamus. Tt is possible that in Anthracotherium they took even a more im-
portant part in locomotion ; but the complete limbs of Anthracotherium are not fully
known at the present time. The inner or 8ec0nd metacarpal (Plate XXXVII. fig. 20, & Plate XXXVIIL. fig. 5, 11.)
is represented in all collections I have visited only by its proximal half.
