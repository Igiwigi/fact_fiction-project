But when we attempt to obtain readings from the septum on the

that the rate of propagation in the system is very rapid. When an idio-ventricular rhythm dominates
the movements of the ventricle and premature contractions are forced from the ventricle, the length
of the returning cycle (see first article) is little if at all longer than an initial or natural cycle. This
fact has never received adequate explanation, It now seems that the time lost by the excitation wave
in travelling from the point stimulated to the rhythm centre in the auriculo-yentricular bundle would
not be appreciable. If the natural ventricular cycle has a duration of a second or more, an addition of
two or three hundredths of a second would pass unnoticed.
