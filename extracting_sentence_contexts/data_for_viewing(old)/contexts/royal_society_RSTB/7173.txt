For comparison with the materials described above, the apex in some specimens was
only three-quarters ringed, i.e. two parallel vertical incisions and a third vertical incision
at right angles were made. The apical meristem had thus continuity of tissues, including
vascular tissue, on one side. The data for one specimen are illustrated in figures 13 to 15.
The isolated terminal region showed more development than the immediately adjacent
lateral bud. Whether or not this was due to the inhibition of the latter by the former after

a certain amount of growth had taken place cannot be decided on the evidence available.
In the isolated terminal region there was no evidence of greater growth on the non-incised
side, where the vascular tissue had not been severed. There was, in fact, a slight tangential
enlargement on the incised side (figure 15), this being probably due to the absence of
compression from adjacent tissues.

Ficure 13, Taken near the base of the incisions: shows the incised tissue (broken lines) and the position
of the isolated terminal region ifr in the centre of the pith. In figure 14, taken higher up, the
isolated terminal region, with its approximately solenostelic vascular system, and an adjacent
solenostelic bud 6 are shown; the former does not show any difference between the incised and non-
incised side (below and above respectively). In figure 15, still higher up, the isolated terminal
region, which is somewhat wider on the incised side (below), overtops the lateral bud 4; /, leaves
