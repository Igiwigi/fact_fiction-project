It was in 1946 that I decided to extend
the mapping of the Warwickshire Pleistocene eastward, and though in the 17 years which
had elapsed since my 1929 paper I had not changed the broad features of the succession
beyond suspecting that (b) was merely an outlier of (e), I had become painfully aware of
the inaccuracy of many of my mapped boundaries. This inaccuracy largely resulted from
my inexperience in recognizing the extent of solifluxion on the slopes. This can result in
gravels being mapped at levels much below that of their true occurrence; more seriously
gravel material creeping downhill over outcrops of Keuper marl or Upper Carboniferous
clays can produce in shallow exposures what appears to be pebbly clay, and since the glacial
clays are also red and are in fact very largely reconstituted Keuper marl, such exposures
may be interpreted as boulder clay. Much of the boulder clay marked either as ‘unspecified
in age’ or ‘older clay’ in my 1929 paper results from this error. There is also in the east Warwickshire succession another possible source of error working
in the opposite way from the one described above.
