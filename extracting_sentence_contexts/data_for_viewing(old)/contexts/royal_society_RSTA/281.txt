earlier-mentioned Hamiltonians to be a good approximation in a real experimental
situation, the ‘quantum computing molecules’ must not interact with each other,
a condition that can be achieved by diluting the sample in an adequate solvent.
One further difficulty with carbon NMR quantum computers is that 'C is only
about 1 per cent abundant. The most abundant !*C has J = 0. It means that, in
a liquid chloroform sample, for instance, only a tiny fraction of the molecules will
actually be two-qubit quantum computers, with a huge background of isolated
'H contributing to the NMR signal. Fortunately, 8C-enriched chloroform (and
other C-based samples) can be purchased!

The two main facts about NMR-QIP are the following. (i) Thermal equilibrium
density matrices can be transformed by means of RF pulses and average
techniques to the so-called pseudo-pure states,

l-e
pb + Wl, (1.3)

where |W) is a pure state and e%hw/2nkT, n the number of qubits and T
the equilibrium temperature. The measured NMR signal from such a state is
proportional to the nuclear magnetization,
