Method by which Periodic Solutions are established-—Any solution of (5.21), when
substituted in (5.20), yields a corresponding solution of (5.1). If the former solution

is periodic and of parameter oc, i.e., if the %, u are Laurent series in e”, the latter
solution is manifestly of the same nature ; in particular, to an equilibrium solution for
the z, u, corresponds for the a, y such a periodic solution. Similarly to a periodic
solution of parameter o/m (m integral) for the 2, «4, corresponds for the x, y a periodic
solution of the same parameter. The fact that z,, «4, ¢ are only involved in K through
the composite arguments v, w, w’ will enable us to find periodic solutions of (5.21), and
therefore of (5.1), and the fact that in (5.20) o is an arbitrary parameter will enable us to
find continuous families of such solutions of continuously varying parameter.
