In contrast to initial value problems that typically arise
when studying mathematical epidemiology, boundary value problems are much more difficult
to deal with. For instance, it is well known that a small change in the boundary conditions may
lead to significant changes in the behaviour of the solutions [20]. In fact, there is no general theory
to the existence and uniqueness of a solution for boundary value problems. In most instances,
we have to study the boundary value problem on a case-by-case basis, especially when the
problem at hand is nonlinear, and/or the boundary conditions are atypical, which is the case
with our problem as the boundary condition (1.4) is given in a non-local integral form. Non-
local boundary conditions have been studied in the past in various forms, recently appearing
in the study and application of fractional differential equations [21].
