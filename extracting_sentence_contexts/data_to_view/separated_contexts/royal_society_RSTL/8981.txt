The occurrence of such gradations under

Q the conditions T have named is what the plexus theory would lead us to expect, becanse
N the closer beneath a section that a stimulus is applied, the greater will be the lateral
E spread of the stimulus through the plexus before it reaches the polypite. Similarly,
= the further the circumferential distance from the nearest end of such a section that the
£ stimulus is applied, the greater will be its lateral spread before reaching the polypite.
=) Lastly, the present hypothesis would further lead us to anticipate the fact that when
S Tiaropsis indicans is prepared as represented in fig. 8, the polypite refers a stimulus
5 applied anywhere in the mutilated nectocalyx to the band of tissue by which it is still
=] left in connexion with that organ ; for it is evident that, according to the hypothesis, the
= radial lines occupying such a band are the only ones whose irritation the polypite is able
S to perceive ; and hence it is to be expected that it should tend to refer to these particular
'S lines a source of irritation occurring anywhere in the mutilated bell*. Z Tt is not quite 80 clear why, in the last-mentioned experiment, the polypite should
& tend to refer a seat of irritation to the unsevered nutrient tube, rather than to the tracts
FI

= * Tt may be objected that the fact of diffused excitability persisting aftor destruction of the localizing function
[= does not; prove that the same tissue-elements are concerned in the two cages. For instance, in fig. 1, Plate 30,
£ before introducing the cut «, a stimulus applied at þ would, as before stated, cause localizing motion of the
== polypite. Let us call the tissue-tracts by which this localizing motion is effected  @, and let us call all the
SZ other tracts belonging to the same system, but occurring in other parts of the hell, x '.
