on describe as causing acceleration and over-inspiratory tonus. Again, the
the rabbit of making a vertical transverse section of the brain through the I b
of the aquedust, renders the animal deeply anesthetized. CrHrisTIANt, und
circumstances, obtained arrest of respiration probably in the line of the tra
to which I shall refer as causing arrest when stimulated.

In view of the importance of this subject, I have repeated their expe
the way the observers aforenamed performed them, and have obtained
results. But I fail to see why the presence of ‘respiratory centres” shot
. been assumed from these experiments, if the term “ respiratory centre” be:

the floor of the 4th ventricle. In fact, excitation experiments of this

fibres than of stimulating central mechanisms.
Kwott,t experimenting more tecently, does not say anything about the
aneesthetic. He found that excitation of the optic thalamus and corpora quad
caused quickening of the respiration. A strong current applied to the unde
of the anterior corpora quadrigemina caused spasm, especially of the eyes,
flanks, the respiration becoming shallower or arrested. He never obt
expiratory arrest. He concluded, from his experiments, that there was no
centre in either the optic thalamus or in the corpora quadrigemina, but that
of excitation of these regions was to produce impulses in psychical or sense
leading to true respiratory centres in the medulla and cord.
His experimental results and the conclusions drawn seem to me to folk
