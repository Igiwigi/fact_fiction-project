In both, the false
stem consists of relatively weak repeatedly forked leaf-bearing axes embedded in a
matrix of adventitious roots. But whereas in Clepsydropsis the numerous persistent
petioles form a considerable part of the transverse section, in Tempskya by far the
greater part of the section is occupied by the transversely cut roots. A significant
point of agreement between the two types is the small number of root-origins observed
â€”a fact which indicates that the roots were of great length. In Clepsydropsis the only
root-origins seen are in the central part of the false stem, whence they appear to have
grown out towards the peripheral zone before they turned downwards. Another feature in common between the two genera is the presence of numerous
roots invading other organs of the plant to which they themselves belong.
