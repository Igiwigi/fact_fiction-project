The equation
{(4f—1)(a*+#f)—20a7—@}*—27&f (a +1 —@Y=0
becomes when @= > (4. e. in the case of parallel rays),
(44*+44*—1Y —27zy*=0,
which may also be written

64a +4824 —1)+1224(44*—1Y+(8/*+1Y(4*—1)=0.

It is now easy to trace the curve. Beginning with the case @=oo, the curve lies
wholly within the reflecting circle, which it touches at two points; the line joining the
points of contact, being in fact the axis of y, divides the curve into two equal portions;
the curve has in the present, as in every other case (except one limiting case), two
cusps on the axis of x (ee fig. 6). Next, if @ be positive and >1, the general form of
the curve is the same as before, only the line joining the points of contact with the
reflecting circle divides the curve into unequal portions, that in the neighbuurhood of
the radiant point being the smaller of the two portions (see fig. 7). When a=1, the two

points of contact with the reflecting circle unite together at the radiant point ; the curve
throws off, as it were, the two coincident lines z=1, and the order is reduced from 6 to 4.
The curve has the form fig. 8, with only a single cusp on the axis of x. If « be further
