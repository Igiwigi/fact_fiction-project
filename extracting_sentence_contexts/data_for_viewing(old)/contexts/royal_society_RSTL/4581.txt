points in contact, the lap was increased and a third rivet introduced to keep down
the ends of the plates.

The sketches in the 31st experiment, Table VII., and those in the 34th and 35th
experiment, Table VIII., represent the form of joint, and the methods adopted for
securing the plates in the direct line of the strain.

On comparing the breaking weights, it will be seen that the increased lap, with a
rivet to keep down and retain the ends of the plates, gives a considerable accession
of strength, and exhibits several important facts in connection with the construction
of vessels exposed to severe pressure. But this becomes more apparent in the forth-
coming experiments on the double-riveted joints.
