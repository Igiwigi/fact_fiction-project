doubted Millerian duets, and could moreover easily be conceived as originating by a
d of the peritonenm, a slight extension of which would give rise to a genital duct
e that of Lepidosteus.
he main difficulty of the view that the genital ducts of Ganoids are not Miillerian
s lies in the fact that they open into the segmental duct. While it is easy to
aderstand the genesis of a duct from a folding of the peritoneum, and also easy to
nderstand how such a duct might lead to the exterior by coalescing, for instance, with
an abdominal pore, it is not easy to see how such a duct conld acquire a communi-
tion with the segmental duct. We do not under these cireumstances wish to speak dogmatically, either in favour
f or against the view that the genital ducts of Ganoids are Miillerian duets.
