proportional to the size of the segment—a supposition which is rendered probable if
we reflect that the smaller the segment the greater is the proportional area of seyered
nutrient-tubes*. And in this connexion it is interesting to observe that, although the
endurance of the smaller segments was less than that of the larger as regards the depri-
vation of nutriment, it was greater than that of the larger segments as regards the
deprivation of oxygen. This is shown by the greater regularity of the rhythm mani-

* It may be thought that the greater area of general tissue-mass in the larger segments than in the
smaller, and not the lesser proportional area of tube-section, is the cause of the larger segments living
longer than the smaller ones. I am led, however, to reject this hypothesis, because in Sarsia, where 8eg-
mentation entails a comparatively 8mall amount of tube-section, there is no constant rule as to the larger
segments showing more endurance than the smaller ones—the conyerse case, in fact, being of nearly
as frequent occurrence. I can only account for this fact by supposing that the endurance of the seg-
ments of Sarsia is determined by the degree in which the three or four minute open tube-ends become
accidentally blocked. This supposition is the only one I can think of to account for the astonishing
contrasts as to endurance that are presented by different segments of the 8ame individual, and, I may
add, of different individuals when deprived of their margins and afterwards submitted to the same condi-
tions. For instance, a number of equally vigorous specimens had their margins removed, and were then
suspended in a glass cage attached to a buoy in the 8ea, Four days afterwards some of the specimens were
putrid, while others were as fresh as they were when first operated on. Again, as an instance of the experi-
ments in segmentation of Sarsia, I may quote an experiment in which a score of specimens were diyided in all
sorts of ways, such as leaving the polypite attached to one half, or three marginal bodies in one portion and
the remaining marginal body in the other portion, ' &c., &c. Yet, although it was yery exceptional to
find the two portions presenting an equal degree of endurance, no uniform results pointing to the cause of the
variations could be obtained. In most cases, however, the energy, as distinguished from the endurance, of tho
