In
ew of the very great intensity of the chemical and electrical forces acting between
the atoms in the molecule, values even much greater than these would not appear
xcessive. But on the other hand such a value of the density requires us to make
he «ther absolutely stationary except in a magnetic field, in order to avoid
hydrodynamical forcives between moving bodies. The residual forcive between
odies at rest in a field of sthereal motion, due to very slight defect of permeability,
s already been shown, after Lord Krtvin’s illustration, to simulate diamagnetism ;
nd the fact that there exist no powerfully diamagnetic substances is so far a
onfirmation of the present hypothesis. The view that the magnetic field of a
rrent involves only slight circulation of the fluid ether is also in keeping with the
account which has been given (§ 46) of the genesis of such a field. On Magneto-Optic Rotation.
