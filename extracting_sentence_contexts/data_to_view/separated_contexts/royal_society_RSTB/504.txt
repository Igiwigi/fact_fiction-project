of nitrogen were yielded in the crops. It may be said, therefore, that about 300 lbs. of nitrogen had been gathered by the
clover growing on a soil upon which beans had yielded smaller and smaller crops, and, in
fact, had eventually practically failed, and which was very poor both in total nitrogen near
the surface, very poor in ready formed nitric acid to a considerable depth, and very poor
in nitrogenous crop-residue for nitrification, If therefore the clover had taken up its
nitrogen either wholly or mainly as nitric acid, the supply could not be due to recent
crop-residue. Not only was so much nitrogen removed in the crops, but the surface soil became
determinably richer in nitrogen, as the following results will show. The plots are the
same as those to which Table VII.
