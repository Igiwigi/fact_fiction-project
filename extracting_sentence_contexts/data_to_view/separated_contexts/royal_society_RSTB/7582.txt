Uvarov (1928,
p. 86) wrote:

*.. physiological factors, which must be considered the real cause of flight. There can
be no doubt that the emigration flight is intimately connected with the process of develop-
ment of the genital products. An internal stimulus for the flight during the maturation of
genital products is prevalent in other insects, such as termites and ants, in which a so-called
nuptial flight precedes copulation; this is exactly what happens in locusts.’

This idea has found no place in Uvarov’s subsequent writings, but deserves mention because
it has been widely accepted, for instance by Imms (1937, p. 306), although it will not bear
examination in the light of the facts. In undertaking migration, adults are merely resuming an activity which is no less
characteristic of the same insects as hoppers. Adults employ a more spectacular form of
locomotion, flight, when migrating, than do the hoppers which can only walk or hop.
