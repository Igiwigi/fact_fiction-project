the left-hand side is =0 for ==, and (as 9 decreases) continually increases, becoming
infinite for j=0; there is consequently a single positive yalue of 6 for which the value

is =1; viz, the equation has a single positive root, and 9 is taken to denote this root.

of this equation ; but for an interior point, or A CO +R< 1. the equation just written

down has no positive root, and 8 becomes =0), that is the positive root of the original
