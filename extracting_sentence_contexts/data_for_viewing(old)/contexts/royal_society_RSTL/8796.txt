(2) The second matter of theoretical interest (namely, the early features in the deyelop-
ment of the shell) has not been preyiously discussed, since the structures described in
the paper as shell-patch, shell-groove, and shell-plug were unknown.

Tf, as seems justifiable, the Cephalopoda are to be regarded as more nearly repre-
senting the molluscan type than do the other classes, or, in other words, more closely
resemble the ancestral forms than they do, we might look in the course of the develop-
ment of the less typical Mollusca for s8ome indication of a representative of the internal
pen of the higher Cephalopoda, We might expect to find some indication of the
connexion between this and the calcareous shell of other forms; in fact the original
shell of all Mollusca should be an internal one, or bear indications of a possible deve-
lopment into that condition.

In Pisidium, in Aplysia, and in Neritina T have submitted evidence of the
existence of a specially differentiated patch of epidermic cells at the aboral pole, which
develops a deep furrow, groove, or pit in its centre, almost amounting to a sac-like
cavity opening to the exterior. The first (chitinous) rudiment of the shell appears as a
disk on the surface of this gland, but also in some cases the cavity or groove is filled by
a chitinous plug.

Let the walls of the sac-close and the activity of its living cells continue, and we
