whereby the apparent specific heat of the mixture would be augmented. The same idea
has already been advanced by PPAUNDLER, and also by MARIGNAC, to account for the
observed deviations of the specific heat of many mixtures from their calculated mean value.

A closer examination of some of the other properties of these alcoholic mixtures does
not, however, tend to confirm this sapposition. 'Thus, as is well known, considerable
contraction in volume follows the mixing of alcohol and water ; but this contraction is
not, as might be supposed, in any degree proportional to the amount of heat evolved.
Thus the maximum contraction takes place in a mixture containing about 45 per cent.
of alcohol, whereas the maximum amount of heat is eyolyed at an alcoholic strength of
about 30 per cent. The maximum elevation of the specific heat above its calculated
mean value is also observed at this strength of 30 per cent. ; and hence, in order to recon-
cile the above theory with fact, we must as8ume on the one hand that the amount of
combination taking place at any given temperature is greatest when 30 parts of alcohol
are mixed with 70 parts of water, and on the other that a given rise of temperature will
produce in this mixture of alcohol and water a greater amount of decomposition or
dissociation than in any other. We should thus have the maximum amount of chemical
action and the feeblest union both occurring with one and the same proportion of alcohol
and water.

The rate of expansion. of the various mixtures seems also opposed to the snpposition
that dissociation is the cause of the high specific heat observed. It is to be supposed
that the greater the amount of dissociation the more nearly would the specific gravity
observed correspond to its calculated value. In other words, the rate of expansion of
all the mixtures should be aboye its mean value, and this excess should stand in some
