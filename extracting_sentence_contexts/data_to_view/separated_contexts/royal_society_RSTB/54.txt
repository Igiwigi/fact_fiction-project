unfrequently there are found forms of very peculiar shape. Some are bent and often
club-shaped, and present other irregularities in thickness. That these forms are only
modifications of the same organism is distinctly proved by the fact that they are found
along with the ordinary forms in one and the same colony when the organism is
submitted to plate-cultivation. These forms do not appear to be due to involution, as
they occur in fresh cultivations and stain well. Neither were spores observed in these
nor in any of the other forms.
