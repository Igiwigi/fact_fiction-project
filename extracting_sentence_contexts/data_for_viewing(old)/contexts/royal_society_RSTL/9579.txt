point of the curve on the left hand side in each cage. The effect, of the weak con-

traction is that of momentarily interrupting the even sweep of diastole after the

strong contraction, and therefore the result on the tracing is a light depression in
the otherwise even curve of ascent. Lest any doubt should arise from the smallness
of the curves representing the weak contractions that the former are in some way
accidental, T may draw attention to the fact that the period of latent stimulation is the
game in the case of all the curves. To render this apparent I have placed marks
below the smaller curves, which show in- each case the exact point where the depressing
effect, of these smaller curves on the ascending sweeps of the larger curves first become
apparent, 7.e., the point at which the feeble contraction begins. Now, what I wish to
be gathered from the whole tracing is this : If the strength of the induction shocks
had been much greater than it was, Â«ll the contractions would have become strong
contractions, and tetanus would have been the result. But, as the strength of the
induction shocks was only slightly more than minimal, the exhaustion consequent on
every strong contraction 80 far diminished the irritability of the tissue that when,
during the process of relaxation, another shock gf the same intensity was thrown in, the
stimulus was only strong enough, in relation to the diminished irritability of the partly
recovered tissue, to cause a feeble contraction. And these facts tend still further
