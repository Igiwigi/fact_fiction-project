Sometimes one completely encloses
a patch of the other, sometimes the line of separation is sinuous or stands higher at
one part of the film than at another. In some cases when no difference of hue was
observed, the passage of an electrical current through the film either created the
difference or enabled us to notice a boundary line which we had not before perceived. Tt is a very curious fact that under such circumstances tiny white flecks appear in
the black along the boundary line between the two tints. Sometimes this line has
been observed before the passage of the current, sometimes it has not been noticed
auntil the flecks have drawn attention to its existence. a These eye observations are confirmed by electrical measurements.
