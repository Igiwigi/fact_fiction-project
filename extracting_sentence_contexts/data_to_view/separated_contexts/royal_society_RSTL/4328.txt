convexo-concave vertebrz of the Wealden were cervical ; it was indeed this circum-
stance, and the extreme rarity of this type, which deterred the Rev. W. D. ConvBears
and myself, at the very commencement of my exploration of the Wealden, from
aszigning them to the Iguanodon-F.

The inspection of a large anterior dorsal yertebra of the conyexo-concave system,
