as the accuracy which is required in this case renders necessary.
Let it therefore, contrary to our 100th experiment, be admitted,
in order to explain the phenomenon of the red glass, which
stops 80 much light and 80 little heat, that all the heat which
it intercepts consists entirely of the rays which are visible, and
that every one of the invisible rays of heat is transmitted.
Then will 999,8 intercepted rays of light be equal to 606 rays
of heat; and the remaining 394, will be the number of rays
we are now to place to the account of the invisible heat which is
transmitted.

Having thus also got rid of this difficulty, we are next to
examine how other facts, collected in the same table, will agree
with our new concession. A violet-coloured glass, for instance,
Stops 955 rays of light; these, at the rate of 999,8, or say 1000,
to 606, must occasion a deficiency of 579 rays of heat. But,
by our table, this glass stops only 489 of them; and there will
thus be go rays of heat left unaccounted for, To enhance
the difficulty, this glass, by our 164th experiment, stops also 2
of the supposed 394 invisible rays, which will amount to an
additional sum of 98. And our 111th experiment shews, that
actually a great number of these rays, that otherwise cannot be
accounted for, come from the store of heat, the rays of which
are of the refrangibility of red light.
