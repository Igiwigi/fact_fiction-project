It would be exceedingly interesting to know whether a body from the magnetic
class, as chloride of iron, would undergo the same change.

q vii. General considerations.

2417. Such are the facts which, in addition to those presented by the phenomena
of light, establish a magnetic action or condition of matter new to our knowledge. Under this action, an elongated portion of such matter usually (2253, 2384.) places
itzelf at right angles to the lines of magnetic force ; this result may be resolyed into
the simpler one of repulsion of the matter by either magnetic pole. "The set of the
elongated portion, or the repulsion of the whole mass, continues as long as the mag-
netic force is sustained, and ceases with its cessation.

2418. By the exertion of this new condition of force, the body moved may pass
either along the magnetic lines or across them; and it may move along or across
them in either or any direction.
