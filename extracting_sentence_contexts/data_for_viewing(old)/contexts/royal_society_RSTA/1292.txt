Proposition 5.1 shows that in order to solve the problem in equation (5.1) we only need to

and we refer the interested reader to the contour tracing literature and, in particular, to [35].

6. Numerics

In this section, we illustrate the potential of our large deviations approach using the standard
IEEE 14-bus test case from MATPOWER [36]. This network consists of 14 nodes housing loads, 6
