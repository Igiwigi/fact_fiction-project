This is also apparent because the net base pressure difference at the interface, i.e. Ap[-g + Aw? cos(wt)], is zero when Ap is zero. In fact, the smaller the density difference, the
greater the required amplitude, A, for the onset of the instability, all other variables being held
fixed. Likewise the smaller the width of a container, the greater the sidewall damping and the
greater the forcing amplitude. More observations can be made from equation (2.1).
