THE POST-GSOPHAGEAL NERVE CORD OF THE CRUSTACEA. 105

Internal Connections of the Posterior Pair of Nerves. The first and most striking facts in connection with the posterior nerves is that
they do not pass to two distinct centres, and that a certain number of the fibres, as
Rerzius also found, do directly decussate. On entering the ganglion the fine fibres of each nerve take up a position posterior
to the large fibres, and form a well-defined single stream which passes to a single mass
of fine plexus on the ventral surface and towards the median line (fig. 34, fpl.).
