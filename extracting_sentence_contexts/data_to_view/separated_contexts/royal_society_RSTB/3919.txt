In the same year Drrescu (25) crossed Strongylocentrotus, Spherechinus, Echinus,
and Arbacia and obtained hybrid larvee with purely maternal characters, which he
suggested were inherited through the cytoplasm of the egg. He investigated the
rate of segmentation, the character of the blastula wall cells, the number of primitive
mesenchyme cells, the pigmentation, and the skeleton. He remarked on the fact that
some individuals of a species cross well, while others will not do so. At this time, too, Drage (17) confirmed the possibility of Boveri's experiments by
cutting a single egg of a sea-urchin in two pieces and fertilizing both the nucleated
and the enucleated portions. Both of them he raised to the gastrula stage.
