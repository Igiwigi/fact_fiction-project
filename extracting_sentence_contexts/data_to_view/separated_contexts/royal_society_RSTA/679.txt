Here again, science differs from art. For a scientist, there is no need to reinvent the wheel, as it
were, when it comes to, for example, using formulae, processes, or other established concepts. In
fact, this is the foundation of science. Scientists cite the work of other scientists with no emotion
attached. Even when we look to the field of biomimetics, direct copying of nature is seen as a high :
ideal—creating nature’s work in a laboratory is not only a worthy pursuit, it is one that is highly =
coveted.
