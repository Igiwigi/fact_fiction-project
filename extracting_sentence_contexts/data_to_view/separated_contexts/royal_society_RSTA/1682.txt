These operators and the corresponding abstract
Cauchy problems
X(t) =Nax(t), £20,

x(0) =x0

play a crucial role in our treatment of the problems (aP1,,) and (aP2). We recall from [8, Sect. 3.1]
that (aCPy,) is called (mildly) well-posed if for every x9 € 0X there exists a unique mild solution. By [8, Thm. 3.1.12], this is equivalent to the fact that N; generates a Co-semigroup on dX.

(c) Operators with abstract generalized Wentzell boundary conditions

Finally, in order to study the problem (aP2), we need the operator A® : D(A’) c X > X with
abstract generalized Wentzell boundary conditions given by

A®CAm, D(A®) = {f € D(Am) 0 D(B) : LAmf = Bf}. (3.2)

If B=0, the boundary conditions defined in (3.2) are called pure Wentzell boundary conditions. This
operator corresponds to the Cauchy problem

i(t)=AP uf, t20,

CP 4B
u(0) = uo. (@CPav)

In theorem 5.1, we will see that the problems (aP2) and (aCPys) are basically equivalent. In
particular, this gives an interpretation of ‘Wentzell’ as ‘dynamic boundary conditions’.
