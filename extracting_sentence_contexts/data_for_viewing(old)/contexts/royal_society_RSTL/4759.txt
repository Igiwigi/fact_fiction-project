temperature of the atmosphere, influential upon a given place in north or south
medium latitudes, are greater in extent in summer than in winter, 80 the correspond-
ing magnetic variations may be expected to vary also, being larger in the northern
hemisphere, when the sun is on the north side of the equator, and less when he
is present in_ the southern hemisphere, and producing like correspondent change

there.

2891. From a most important investigation by Colonel SaBinzÂ®, founded on the
results of observations at Toronto and Hobarton, the facts appear to be that the mag-
netic intensity is greater in both hemispheres in those months which are winter in the
northern hemisphere, and summer in the southern. Similar results are greatly
wanted for other localities, and would show whether the different disposition of
land and sea has anything to do with the question, or whether the results at Toronto
and Hobarton are true exponents of hemispherical effects. As8uming Toronto and
Hobarton as being such exponents, the dip in both hemispheres is greater (i. e. greater
north dip at Toronto and south dip at Hobarton) in those months which are winter
in the northern, and summer in the southern hemisphere. Whether there is any
annual variation of the dip or total force in the equatorial parts of the globe is very
important to determine. It would be well worth while to take up a station for the
express purpose ; the instruments are very simple, and the obseryations would require
only a single obseryer. They are described in the paper referred to. Unfortunately
