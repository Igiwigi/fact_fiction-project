It also underestimates
the extent to which significant procedural reform has already
been implemented, especially during the last decade or so. The first level of misunderstanding concerns the somewhat
complex relationship between adversarial criminal procedure
and truth-finding in adjudication. Lawyers, it is said, play
adversarial games and courts are concerned only with forensic
proof rather than the factual truth of ‘what really happened’
regarding disputed facts. Critics fail to appreciate that adver-
sarial procedure is designed to promote truth-seeking not to
frustrate it. Before sceptical readers fall about laughing, let
me stress that this is a claim about the system as a whole and

its institutional design, not about the motivations of pro-
fessional participants in particular cases.
