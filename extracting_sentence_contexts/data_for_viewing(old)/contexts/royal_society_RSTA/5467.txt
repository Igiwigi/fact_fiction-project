In order to model these measurements, the cell contractility model was re-
calibrated for MSCs by decreasing oOmax to 8kPa and employing a Hill constant
k, =12 while keeping all other parameters fixed. Good correspondence between
measurements and predictions is obtained (within measurement uncertainty) for
ooth the scaling of Fy, with N (figure 9b) and the average traction force per
post as a function of post position (figure 10). It is worth noting here that
he threshold number of posts, when the behaviour of the cells switches from
an upscaling to a downscaling response, appears to be dependent on cell type;
compare figures 5a, 7 and 9b. However, recall that Deshpande et al. (2007)
1ad shown that this threshold number of posts increases with decreasing post
spacing. We thus believe that the primary reason for differences in the threshold
values seen between figures 5a, 7 and 9b is not cell type but rather is related
o the fact that the post spacing varied for the different cell types investigated
1ere.

In summary, the contractile response of MSCs on an array of micro-posts
exhibits the same qualitative trends as smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts.
Further, the contractility model once suitably recalibrated again captures the
observations with acceptable accuracy.

6. Sensitivity to the properties of the micro-posts

The bio-chemo-mechanical model here is further used to predict the sensitivity of
the response of smooth muscle cells to the geometric and mechanical properties of
the PDMS micro-posts. All simulations are presented for initially square-shaped
