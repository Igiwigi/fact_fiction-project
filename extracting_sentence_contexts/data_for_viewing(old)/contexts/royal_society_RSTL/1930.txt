1. Introduction.

True higher departments of eyery science are doubtless its general principles
and its laws. These have a claim to our consideration beyond that of insulated
facts or mere details. Impressed with this truth, I have hitherto devoted my
attention chiefly to the laws and principles of physiology. In a former memoir*,
I gave the outline of one of the most general of the laws of this science,—that
of the inverse ratio of the respiration and of the irritability. - In the present
memoir, I propose to give an account of a principle of action in the animal
economy, which has not hitherto, I think, been distinguished with sufficient
precision from the other vital and animal functions.

The principle to which I have adverted is connected, in a peculiar manner,
with the medulla oblongata and the medulla spinalis. There is still much dis-
crepancy of opinion amongst physiologists, in regard to the properties and
functions of these parts of the nervous system. LecaLLos concluded, from
his interesting series of experiments, that the spinal marrow, as a whole, and in
