A freedom of escape similar to that from bodies at great elevations would occur at
any other level were the vapour removed from the air above it. Hence the withdrawal
of the sun from any region over which the atmosphere is dry, must be followed by quick
refrigeration. This is simply an @ priori conclusion from the facts established by expe-
riment; but I believe all the experience of meteorology confirms it. The winters in
Tibet are almost unendurable from this cause. The isothermals dip deeply from the
north into Central Asia during the winter, the earth's heat being wasted without impe-
diment in space, and no sun existing sufficiently powerful to make good the loss.
