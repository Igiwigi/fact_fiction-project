Fee tp>b the equation 2275 - +7 =1
has (as is at once seen) a 8ingle positive root, and 4 becomes equal to the positive root
of this equation ; but for an interior point, or A CO +R< 1. the equation just written

down has no positive root, and 8 becomes =0), that is the positive root of the original
equation continually diminishes with e, and for e=0 becomes ultimately =0; its value
