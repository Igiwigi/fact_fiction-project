652 MAJOR P. A. MACMAHON ON THE

This representation is only possible when the subjacent succession of lines is insisted
upon. Art. 44, Every Sylvester-graph in two dimensions is representative of two
unipartite partitions ; it may, in fact, be read by lines or by columns, and when the
two readings are identical the graph is said to be self conjugate. In this enlarged theory every graph denotes 3! graphically-regularised multi-
partite partitions ; of the same total content, but not, as a rule, appertaining to the
same multipartite number. Take coordinate axes as shown, the axis of z beiag perpendicular to the plane of
the paper.
