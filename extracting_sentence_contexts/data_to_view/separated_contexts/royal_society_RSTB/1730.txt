Also, the wing appears to be perfectly continuous all round the spore, and not to be
in any way sub-divided into compartments or cells. The fusion of the three abortive
sister-cells of a macrospore into such a continuous ring, is entirely without
precedent, and can hardly be assumed in the absence of any positive evidence. The
fact that the winged spores of Spencerites ave ofien found still grouped in their
original tetrads (see fig. 148) is also opposed to the interpretation of each spore as
itself representing a group of four sister-cells. On the latter assumption, we should
have tetrads of tetrads, an arrangement for which there seems to be no analogy.
