with its foetal blood vessels containing nucleated deeply staining blood corpuscles.

The mesoblastic villi (V.) are blunt processes branching to a certain extent and
carrying blood vessels,

Next comes the trophoblast, so I take it to be, which makes up the great bulk of
the thickness of the placenta. It is a network of cubical cells in the meshes

of which is maternal blood. Close to the mesoblast the meshes are wide and the
trophoblast is thinner; in the deeper layers the meshes are small. In fact the
deeper the tissue the smaller the mesh, and at its base a different kind of tissue is
found. This is less cavernous, stains more lightly, contains some very large nuclei,
and shows less cell division.

The chief advance of this specimen beyond the first described one consists in the
growth of the allantois so as to surround the whole embryo, and the development ot
the allantoic villi. These push against the spongy trophoblast, and become
enveloped by the uprising trophoblastic lacunze, now tense with maternal blood.

In some places there is blood between the trophoblast and the mesoblast. The
trophoblast is here very much reduced, and probably the blood between the
trophoblast and mesoblast is due to rough handling, or post-mortem changes, though
