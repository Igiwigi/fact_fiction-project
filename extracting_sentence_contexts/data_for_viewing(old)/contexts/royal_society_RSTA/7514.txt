millivolts in order to be certain that the acid bubble is moving freely and behaving
symmetrically. Finally, there is provision for testing the insulation of the various
conductors and leads. All insulators consist of quartz or sulphur-coated ebonite, and
provision is made, as far as possible, for maintaining a dry atmosphere about them. It
has not been found necessary to keep the insulators warm, though this would be neces-
sary if it was desired to use the apparatus regularly throughout the year. The main
insulation difficulty is caused by spiders’ webs. They insulate almost perfectly in dry
weather and are thus liable to escape detection. With the onset of damper conditions
not only does the insulation become poor, but the damp thread may probably be
bridging two different metals, the whole system constituting in fact a voltaic cell, and
the result is a rapid creep of the electrometer bubble making observations impossible.

It is necessary to record the displacements of the electrometer under considerable
magnification. In order to obtain a sharp image, the top of the capillary tube is
ground flat and a strip of thin glass is cemented on to it with Canada balsam. The
electrometer is mounted on a glass plate and fixed on the stage of a microscope which
projects a real image of the acid column, magnified 40 times, on to a slit of about
0:02 mm. width, parallel to the axis of the capillary tube. The motion of the image
along the slit is recorded on a photographic plate whose sensitive emulsion is just above
the slit and in uniform horizontal motion at right angles to it. The illumination is
provided by a 100 W projector lamp and simple condensing system. The records are
obtained on Ilford Ordinary 15 x 4 in.” (88 x 10 cm.*) plates, two 15 in. records being
