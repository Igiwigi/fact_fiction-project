3. Results and discussion

(a) Fe surfaces and interfaces :=
We begin with an analysis of a conventional, centrosymmetric ferromagnetic metal, Fe, in which : a
we break the inversion symmetry by introducing a surface. Bulk Fe occurs in the bec structure at 73
low temperatures, with a net magnetization from the ferromagnetic ordering of the local moments aes
on the Fe atoms. The magnetocrystalline anisotropy orients the magnetic moments along a (001) 22
direction, which lowers the space group symmetry to 14/mm'm’'; the resulting site symmetry of Fe, [4
which is on Wyckoff position 2a, is 4/mm'm'. The presence of inversion symmetry at the atomic : *
site forbids the presence of magnetoelectric multipoles. Our first-principles calculations in this : =
setting confirm this fact. [&

On introduction of a surface, or an interface to a dielectric material, the inversion symmetry
is broken and the system becomes insulating in the normal direction. These two properties
combine to allow the linear magnetoelectric effect, which has been demonstrated for slabs of
other ferromagnetic metals both computationally [9,10] and experimentally [32,33].

Our first model system is a ferromagnetic Fe slab, represented by a superlattice containing
16 (001)-oriented layers of bcc-structure Fe separated by 102 A-thick vacuum layers (figure 1b,
upper panel). We set the in-plane lattice constant of the bec Fe unit cell to 2.98 A, corresponding
to an in-plane Fe-Fe distance of 2.43A, so that it forms a coherent interface with MgO in the
Fe/MgO heterostructures that we study next (amgo/ /2 =2.98 A). We then relax the out-of-plane
Fe—Fe distances, and obtain a Fe-Fe distance of 2.41 A in the outer layers, while the Fe-Fe distance
