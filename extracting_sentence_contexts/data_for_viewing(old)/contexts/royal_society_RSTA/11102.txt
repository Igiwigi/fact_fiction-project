O, Cl, Br, I, Hg, 8, P, and As; and. the numbers obtained in these instances did
not seem to bear any relation to each other, or to any known constant. ‘Thus, the
refractivities* of Cl, Br, and I increase with the increase in their atomic weights,
though not proportionately. But O, with an atomic weight sixteen times that of
H, only retards light twice as much, while the index of N is actually greater than
that of O. Discouraged by these anomalous results, investigators have generally
contented themselves with calculating values for the refractivities of the elements
from the effects they produce in compounds, and have aimed at obtaining an empirical
constant for each element which would satisfy an additive law in compounds. The
numbers so obtained are found to vary with the constitutional formula of the com-
pound in question, and the variations are sufficiently regular to afford assistance in
analysing the constitution of complex molecules ; but even the best results sometimes
fail to fit in with the facts in a way which proves that our empirical formule are still
far from the truth.
In 1901, however, the data at disposal received a notable enlargement by the
discovery of argon and the other members of the family of inert gases. These
