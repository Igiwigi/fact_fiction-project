Section IIL.—Steady motion of hollow vortex.

9. The form of a hollow vortex and its motion are conditioned by the fact thab the
velocity of the fluid relatively to the hollow, when the motion is steady, must be
constant over the whole surface of the tore. When the section is s8mall compared

with the aperture, the section will clearly be very approximately circular, and to a first,
approximation the motion will be represented by the stream function found in the
previous section, the value of « therein being chosen 80 as to make the coefficient of
cos v in the expression for the velocity disappear. This will give the first term in the
