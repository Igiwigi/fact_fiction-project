In addition, it should be noted that for a mean flow at rest no positive growth rates were
found, meaning that the D2Q9-LBM is linearly stable for Ma = 0 no matter how low the value of
v is. This is true whatever the equilibrium and the collision model considered, with the exception
of the cumulant-based LBM. This seems to be in contradiction to previous studies [26,41,96], but in
fact, this defect might be related to the LSA itself, which cannot account for nonlinear mechanism
without increasing the truncation order of the Taylor expansion (A 1). Eventually, the numerical discretization leads to spurious couplings between modes, that were
not observed for the DVBE. These couplings induce energy transfers between non-hydrodynamic
and hydrodynamic modes, eventually leading to positive growth rates, i.e. linear instabilities.
