On the other hand, wave motions are
studied for their role in the detailed air-sea exchanges of mass, momentum and energy, which
are the critical boundary conditions for large-scale circulation problems. As the dynamics are too
complicated to yield definitive answers, the product of the small-scale studies is also reduced to
parametrization. In fact, many of the parametrization schemes of the wave motions were actually
based on ocean surface wind rather than on wave parameters [8]. Yet, the cumulative effort of
past studies has given us a strong hint that waves could not be neglected in the study of ocean
dynamics [6,7,9], not even in large-scale circulation problems, for they are the most energetic
motions in the ocean surface layer, consequently playing a dominant role in air-sea interaction
processes [10] and in ocean mixing way beyond the surface layer [11]. Even with these understandings, many of the past studies of the waves in the context of
ocean dynamics are concentrated on breaking waves [12], for each of the episodic breaking
events would release a huge amount of energy.
