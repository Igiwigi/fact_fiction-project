take a different point of view: I dismiss naturalness arguments and explore instead the option
that the scale of new physics might be much larger than the TeV scale, perhaps even as large as
the Planck scale, Mp}.

It is a non-trivial fact that the SM can be extrapolated up in energy in the huge range from M; to
Mp) ina consistent manner, e.g. without any of the couplings hitting a Landau pole. Nevertheless,
the extrapolated Higgs quartic coupling has an interesting behaviour [4-10]: due to one-loop
corrections from the heavy top, its beta function is large and negative and this drives it to negative
values at around A; ~ 10!°GeV.! This running coupling is shown in figure 1a, with the bands
illustrating the impact of experimental errors in the top mass, the Higgs mass and the strong
coupling, as indicated.

The problem with a negative ( is that it leads to an instability of the Higgs potential. Indeed,
to approximate well the full potential at a field value h, one should evaluate the couplings at a
renormalization scale jz ~ h. Then, at h >> Mz, the potential is dominated by the quartic term V(h >
Mi) = (Pau =h)ht, and for A(h) < Oitis deeper than the EW vacuum, as shown in figure 1b. Such
instability, due to heavy fermions coupled to light scalars, has been known for a long time and was
