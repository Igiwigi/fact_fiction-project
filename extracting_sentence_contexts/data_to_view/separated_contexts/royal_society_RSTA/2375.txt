When the measurements do not capture bistability, the
test results cannot be distinguished from supposingly linear chatter tests where instability should
arise in symmetric arrangement along the steps. For the measurements, we also use the industrial jargon to label vibration states as ‘stable’ as
SSC and CH. In fact, all these states are related to a stable invariant object of the dynamical system
(1.4). Chatter CH state involves both the evolved threshold vibration and the onset of amplifying
vibrations originated, on the one hand, from the USC period one solution xp. The stability loss
is caused by an orbital Hopf bifurcation [13], which introduces dominant (chatter) frequency
(figure 3i) and its modulations [72].
