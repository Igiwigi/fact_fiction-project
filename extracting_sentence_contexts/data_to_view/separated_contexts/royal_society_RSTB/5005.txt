BURNE: ANATOMY OF

relatively few and small. As the point is approached at which the second afferent
branchial vessels leave the thyroid sinus, a complex.mass of vehicles appears in the roof
of the sinus (Plate 2, fig. 12, m.). This mass is of some apparent thickness and density, but
is, in fact, like the rest of the gland, composed of a relatively thin layer of vesicles
surrounding complex offshoots of the general cavity of the sinus, forming a sponge-like
intermixture of lymph spaces, and baulks and trabeculee of connective tissue, within
which lie the vesicles. Towards the hinder end of the gland this mass of vesicles more
or less surrounds the ventral aorta and roots of the afferent branchial vessels, forming
lateral masses in folds connecting these vessels to the lateral walls of the sinus. In
other parts at the hinder end of the gland, vesicles, though present in most parts of the
walls of the sinus, are relatively few and small.
