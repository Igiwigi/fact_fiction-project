the higher insecta.

In the first pair of legs (fig. 9), the episternum is modified to form a strongly
chitinised band associated with the sternum at its inner or ventral extremity, and
with the under surface of the pronotum at its dorsal or apical extremity. The
epimeron is small and inconspicuous, while the meron cannot be distinguished as a
separate element of the coxa. I have been unable to recognise any traces of latero-
sternites in the prothorax. In the two succeeding pairs of legs (fig. 8), the episterna
are much less chitinised and more intimately related with their corresponding limbs.
The epimera are very large, sub-triangular in form, and, curving upwards and outwards,
project dorsally on either side of the tergal shields of their respective segments
(figs. 1 and 8). That these elements have no relation to wing vestiges, notwith-
standing their appearance, is obvious from the fact that they are present on the
prothoracic segment and are, moreover, recognisable in the winged forms also. The
meron is a large and conspicuous component of the coxa, and has the appearance of

being a flattened wing-like outgrowth of the latter. Placed between the sternum
and episternum is a separate sclerite or laterosternite. The interpretation of the
basal elements of the limbs is far from easy, especially owing to the lack of agreement
