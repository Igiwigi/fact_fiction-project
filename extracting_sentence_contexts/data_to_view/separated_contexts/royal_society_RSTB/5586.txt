Acidity.—Luteose is definitely neutral in reaction, since with 0-2351 gm. a single
drop of N/10 sodium hydroxide was sufficient to render the solution alkaline to phenol-
phthalein.

3. Optical Rotation.—Luteose is markedly lavorotatory. Because of the fact that its
aqueous solution is slightly opalescent in the cold the optical rotation was determined
in a jacketed tube at 90°C. 0-5248 gm. was dissolved in 50 c.c. of water and polarised
in a 20 cm. tube at 90° C. The average of a large number of readings obtained was

— 0-886° for the mercury yellow light corresponding to [a]i? “soy = — 42°2°, and
—0-974° for the mercury green light corresponding to [a] fi) Gosn = — 46°4°.

4. Hydrolysis by boiling dilute acid.—-4819 gm. of luteose was hydrolysed by
boiling for six hours with 10-03 ¢.c. of N/1 H,SO,.
