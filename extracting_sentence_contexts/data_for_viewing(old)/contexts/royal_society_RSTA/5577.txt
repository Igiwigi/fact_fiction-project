Similar considerations were already present in the thinking of the ancient Greeks to obtain
what Aristotle defined as téxvn [téchne]: a real productive science [34]. He noted that the
technological advancement can be obtained by different means, that could be achieved by either
scientists or empirics. However, Aristotle set apart scientists from the empirics: people with a
high degree of expertise in a specific domain, but who lack any theory to justify their results.
The empirics can even often achieve outstanding results, but what clearly divides science from
empiricism is that it comes with a theory whose domain principles justify why certain decisions
are correct in specific circumstances [34,35]. ML algorithms are like empirics to a certain extent,
but complemented with means of understanding (interpreting) their decision process may lead
to scientific knowledge.

In our opinion, we do not believe that the current state-of-the-art ML algorithms might
significantly outperform the human capability of detecting cardiac abnormalities. In fact, the
number of possible confounding factors, co-morbidities, number of rare conditions and evolution
in time of the diseases may all increase the amount of data necessary for ML models to be
trained. In order to mitigate such issues, the creation of innovative ML algorithms, capable of
incorporating the domain knowledge, would facilitate the development of these models (e.g.
less data-hungry algorithms, faster training, larger interpretability) and the introduction of such
methodologies in the clinical practice, thus fostering trust in their use.

a) Limitations of the study

The frameworks presented some limitations. First, rhythm-based cardiac abnormalities were
not properly handled by our methodology. Given the fact that an altered rhythm may or may
not affect the regularity of the occurrence of any waves, it was not possible to define the one-
