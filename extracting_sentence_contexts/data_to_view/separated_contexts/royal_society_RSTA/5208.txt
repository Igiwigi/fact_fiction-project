In addition, we have found that, for fixed amplitude Lp, Mmax increases with the
increase of Ro, as shown in figure 4b. However, in the case of stable evolution, M < Mmax, the
input soliton cannot display persistent rotary motion. In fact, it performs a circular motion only
at an initial stage of the propagation, subsequently transforming into a stationary stable state. A typical example of this evolution scenario is shown in figure 4c. Obviously, this scenario is
drastically different from those described above, when we considered lattices with sole refractive
index or loss modulation.
