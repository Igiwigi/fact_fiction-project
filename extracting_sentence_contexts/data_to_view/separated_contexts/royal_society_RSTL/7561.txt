g , 2, &e. refer may be a siny
gular point, and in particular it is Proper to consider the case where the point is a cusp. T use in this case an appropriate notation; a conic which simply passes through a cusp,
in fact meets the curve at the cusp in two points ; and I denote the condition of passing
through the cusp by 1z1; similarly, a conic which touches the curve at the cusp, in fact
there meets it in three points, and I denote the condition by 2z1 ; Tz1, 2zL are thus special

forms of 1, 2, and the annexed I indicates the additional point of intersection arising
ips0 facto from the point 1 or 2 being a cusp. Similarly, we should have the symbols
3zT, 4x1, 5x1; but it is to be observed that at a cusp of the curve there is no proper
conic having a higher contact than 2z1; thus if the symbol contains 3z1, or @ fortiori,
if it contain 4x1 or 5el, the number of the conics is in every case =0; it is thus only
the cases zl and 2z1 which need to be considered.
