Figure 10. Non-eigensolution dynamics in the hierarchical model. (a—c) Initial motifs. Colours denote the eigensolutions of the
motif (which do not directly translate to the larger network). The green node shows amplitude death, the red and blue nodes
are antiphase-synchronized with respect to each other. (d—-f) Space-time plots for the networks built from the initial motifs
in (a), (b) and (c), respectively. Other parameters: n = 2, N =o 5,8 =0,A =1,w =2. (Online version in
colour.)

scheme indicates the state corresponding to v = (1,1,0, —1 — 1). We observe that the dynamics is
identical to the dynamics shown in figure 7b which we have obtained for the modular fractal
model. This is due to the fact that in spite of very different topologies, the eigenvectors of the
networks and thus the dynamics are identical.

We also study the solutions that do not correspond to eigensolutions. We do so for the three
different motifs as shown in figure 10a-c, respectively, and for a hierarchy of n =2. The space-
time plots are shown in figure 10d-f, respectively. We observe that these solutions have as well a


hierarchy in their dynamics. The nodes of the middle motif and the middle node of the remaining
motifs are either phase shifted or have different radii from the remaining nodes or both. This
is a result of the structure of the motifs: the middle nodes of all three motifs have a different
connectivity from the other nodes. Additionally, in figure 10f, the first two motifs have a different
amplitude from the last two, which is reflected in the horizontal asymmetry in the topology about
