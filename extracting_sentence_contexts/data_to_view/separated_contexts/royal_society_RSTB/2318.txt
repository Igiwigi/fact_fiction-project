In view
6 of the comparative ease with which blaze currents are abolished, I was led to repeat
q the previous experiments, observing upon one and the same eyeball the response to
Bj light and the response to electrical stimuli, before and after strong tetanisation.
= Blaze effects were completely absent while the response to light remained unaltered
5 —if anything, apparently increased by reason of a diminution of resistance. I must
Q refrain from any attempt to explain this remarkable result at present. There can,
ical however, be no mistake as regards the fact itself.

£ Experiments Exhibiting the Influence of Strong Tetanisation upon the Blaze Currents.

5 The eyeball is set up as usual in the dark chamber and connected with the keyboard as shown in fig. 2.
a Compensation is established at the commencement of each group of excitations, and is left unaltered
oO during that group. The exciting currents are not short-cireuited from the galvanometer, which is
s left in series with the eyeball, the compensator, and the induction coil (by unplugging the keyboard
a of fig. 2 at 1, 2, 4 and 5). The observations are taken before and after tetanisation for 4 minute at
} 10,000 units of the Berne coil fed by 2 Leclanché cells.
