% leasb of its medullary fibres, had escaped injury. With this lesion of the gyrus
8 pocampi was as80ciated, in evident causal relationship, a very marked impairment
5g tactile sensibility in all its forms. This, however, gradually diminished until at
the end of ten days it ceased to be discoverable.
Sz Hearing was not in the slightest degree impaired by this bilateral cerebral lesion.
='The condition as to vision was rather a difficult one to determine as regards each
Se. But it was clearly not dependent on any lesion of the optic tracts or nerves.
All that could be made out was that vision was not permanently abolished towards
ie right side, but whether the hemiopia was symmetrical or not was not determined.
Z The atrophy of the right optic nerve was purely secondary to the destruction of the
snal centres of the cortex, and was not due to any direct injury of the optic tract or
is connexions with the corpora quadrigemina, or corpora geniculata.
Â£ The fact that the right optic nerve was specially atrophied showed that the cerebral
@nbres in relation with the right eye had specially suffered ; but an exact estimation
& the amount of lesion in the cortex and medullary fibres of the occipito-angular
1Sgion in each hemisphere could not be made.

Experiment 27 (Plate 31, figs. 125-132).

In this case the left hemisphere was exposed in the region of the incisura pre-occi-
pitalis and pli de passage from the middle temporo-sphenoidal convolution to the occipital
lobe. With the aid of a director passed between the under surface of this region and
the tentorium cerebelli, the third occipital convolution was divided by a horizontal
