investigated in the available literature, e.g. [7-10].

For low to intermediate cooling rates, solidification occurs close to thermodynamic
equilibrium at the solidification front and leads to fine regular eutectic structures that follow
expected trends, e.g. a decreasing eutectic colony size and decreasing lamellar spacing for
increasing cooling rate. For increasingly higher cooling rates, coupled eutectic growth still
prevails, but the regularity of the lamellar structure gradually disappears [7-14]. A further type
of microstructure formation occurs at very high cooling rates: the eutectic reaction is suppressed
as a result of partitionless solidification [4,15-19].

In [15-18], it was suggested that eutectic reactions in the liquid can be suppressed in
the eutectic systems, with the formation of supersaturated solid solutions after solidification.
Experimental proofs of this fact with an analysis of the microstructure and composition were
obtained in [4,19]. Two studies are available in the literature where eutectic alloys and cooling
rates of up to 10Â°Ks~! were investigated [4,19]. Conclusions on partitionless solidification of
eutectic Al-35%Mg and Pb-11%Sb alloys are drawn, based on the observation of single-phase
areas that do not show the typical two-phase eutectic structure. The studies in [4,19] were carried
out using optical microscopy with magnifications of up to 1500x and a spatial resolution of
approximately 1 um. However, it is well known that rapid quenching may lead to a substantial
refinement of the microstructure [8-13], and the microstructure may consist of finely dispersed
inclusions that are not visible in an optical microscope. Thus, the results of the above-mentioned
experimental work from the 1980s do not allow us to finally conclude on the formation of a
homogeneous solid solution during rapid solidification of eutectic alloys.
