This set X contains the following 20 trinucleotides:

X = {AAC, AAT, ACC, ATC, ATT, CAG, CTC, CTG, GAA, GAC,
GAG, GAT, GCC, GGC, GGT, GTA, GTC, GTT, TAC, TTC}. The two sets X; and X3, of 20 trinucleotides each, in the shifted frames 1 and 2, respectively,
of genes can be deduced from X by a circular permutation. These three trinucleotide sets
present several strong mathematical properties, particularly the fact that X is a maximal CÂ° self-
complementary trinucleotide circular code [12]. The subset {CAG, CTC, CTG, GAG} of the circular
code X is a trinucleotide comma-free code and, furthermore, C? and self-complementary [13]. Comma-free codes are important codes as they represent a limit class of circular codes with three
particular properties: (i) no word of a comma-free code is found in a shifted frame; (ii) the length
of reading frame retrieval is the shortest; and (iii) the probability of reading frame coding is
maximal and equal to 1 [14].
