As regards the organising
function of the node, therefore, the important part of Hunt and WiLL1ER’s work is the
negative conclusion that the posterior part of the streak is not capable of self-differentia-
tion: their results on this point are shown to be inconclusive by the experiments
described above and by others to be described in the section dealing with grafts. One
might suppose that the failure of development in their experiments was due to some
mechanical cause, but without an intimate knowledge of the technique, it is difficult
to make any definite suggestions. Possibly the grafted tissue becomes rolled up in
such a way as to interfere with the movements of cell masses: such an explanation is
perhaps suggested by the fact that WILLIER and Raw es did not obtain differentiation
of the posterior part of the trunk even in grafts of the entire blastoderm. Conceivably,
the fact that their grafts were allowed to differentiate to a much later stage than that
obtained in my experiments may have been of importance. UMANSKI (1931) also failed
to get differentiation of the posterior half of the primitive streak on the chorio-allantois,
but from his diagrams of the operation it appears likely that the fragments which
he transplanted did not actually contain any presumptive neural material, so that his
failure to obtain this tissue is not surprising.
