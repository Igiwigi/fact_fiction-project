transfusion tissue, are described on p. 26. Although we have no specimen of this
plant with its fructification in organic continuity, there exists that constant
association with JYezostrobus which is sometimes such a valuable suggestion in
dealing with fossil fragments. There is also sufficient similarity in anatomical detail
between the scale of the seed and the leaf of the plant (see p. 40) to leave but little
real doubt as to their identity. Everything marks out Yezonia as being one of
that company of plant types which are known only from the fossils, and whose
structure would never have been imagined had not their actual remains come down
to science.

Owing to the lack of absolute proof of continuity with the vegetative parts,
Yezostrobus must be named and considered separately. Its salient features were
described on p. 33. Its chief interest lies in the fact that it bore seeds in a cone,
which seeds were massive and organised like those of Cycads, and at the same time
had a nucellus.free from the integument right down to the base. The seed itself,
indeed, was like that of the Paleozoic 7rigonocaipus, while it was borne on what
seems to have been a simple scale, with only one seed on it. It will be remembered
that the supposed vegetative parts have no likeness to Araucaria, a genus with
which the single-seeded scale might suggest comparison. This and the preceding
plant then afford a fascinating field for theoretical and general phylogenetical
discussions, from any further excursion into which we intend to refrain for
the present.
