purpose of eliminating the influence of secular change on their actual positions in the
annual range. This correction is in each case the proportional part of the secular
change due to the interval of time occurring between the month in question and the
middle period of the year. At Toronto, Hobarton and the Cape, the correction is
Â«mall and little significant, even in the months most distant from the middle of the
year; and the Annual Fariation is consequently very little different at these stations
from the annual range, either in magnitude or in the relative position of the several
months. But it is otherwise at St. Helena, where the secular change is large, and
its elimination therefore is indispensable, even to an approximate knowledge of the
phenomena of the Annual Variation. Happily at St. Helena the bypothesis of an uni-
form and equable distribution of the secular change throughout the year, upon which
the elimination is based, has been shown by the series of fortnightly mean declina-
tions continued for seyeral years, to be a correct representation of the facts of nature.

For the mean Diurnal Variation, it is manifestly indifferent whether the secular
change be eliminated or not ; the line DD retains in either case its position and
form unchanged, for the sum of the monthly corrections for secular change in every
case ==0. If, therefore, the Annual Fariations were $ubstituted for the annual
ranges in the dark vertical lines in Plate XXVIL., we have reason to believe that a
correct representation would be given of what would be the facts of the Annual and
Diurnal Variations if no secular change whatsoever existed; or if a secular change
were to take place (as has recently been the case in Britain) in the opposite direction
