cells may have different functions in different situations.

The hypothesis that the cellular infiltration is an effect of homograft breakdown emerges
from the present investigation strengthened. The evidence suggests, however, that the

plasma-cell infiltration is more than a quantitative response to a certain intensity of break-
down of foreign tissue and that, independently of this, it has a specific connexion with the
immune response. This is supported by the fact that, although there is a large amount of
cell death in the original graft immediately after transplantation, the infiltrating cells do
not appear until about 6 days later (first-set grafts). It is further supported by the obser-
vation of Sanders (1950) that while frozen-dried killed homografts of nerve fail to immunize
a rabbit and to elicit a cellular response, if placed in an animal already immunized by
a live nerve homograft from the same donor, they then elicit a round cell infiltration.
A hapten would appear to be involved here.

Nevertheless, in the present grafts the plasma-cell reaction was closely related to the
actual tissue destruction, and the key to its meaning undoubtedly lies in the question of
why a predominance of immature plasma cells is always associated with graft tissue which
is on the point of breaking down. On the whole this phenomenon fits better the resorption
hypothesis, which would predict it, rather than the antibody production hypothesis by
