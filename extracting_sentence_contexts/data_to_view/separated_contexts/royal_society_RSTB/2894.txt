The thickness of the chitin is probably in no case absolutely uniform,
but the broader sides of the tube have each a thickened area. Concerning this,

Petseneer has already stated (72, p. 177) that “cet épaississement est surtout
développé vers le cété interne des feuillets chez les Anomiide, Arcide, et Trigoniide,
et surtout vers le cdté externe (done ventral des filaments) dans les autres Lamelli-
branches ;” but although this statement is correct in the main, and may be allowed
to pass as a text-book generalisation, it fails to take into account the fact that the
position of the thickened band frequently varies at different levels. The general
tendency is for the thickening to be nearer the interlamellar edge of the filament in
sections taken towards the ventral edge of the demibranch than in those taken at
higher levels. Occasionally there are two thickened bands on each broad face, one
towards the incurrent and one towards the interlamellar side (figs.
