Geol. Soc.,’ vol. lix., Part 2). The fact that Africa is surrounded by a belt of seas. and this again by a belt of
land before the Pacific is reached, points perhaps to a bodily subsidence of the blunt
end of the pear, the circle of fracture having possibly been the line of Pacific folding. Such a fracture would, of course, displace the centre of gravity of the pear, and
probably this would account not only for the feature just mentioned, but also for the
non-appearance of the protuberance. It will be noticed that the smallness of the
latitude of the extremities of the axis (6°) agrees well with the theory of planetary
evolution put forward in §§ 25-80 of the present paper. |
