8. CONCLUSIONS

It cannot be guaranteed that there are no undiscovered sources as the method of analysis
can only be used in favourable regions, but there are certainly no other large sources. It
would be interesting but laborious to repeat the analysis for other epochs, but there is no
reason to believe that essentially different results would be obtained, and the fact that the
dipoles are vertical makes it possible to obtain their approximate position for other epochs
by inspection of the isoporic charts in Z, which confirms that there are generally sources very
near the equator. The interpretation of the results in terms of a two-dimensional current flow in a thin
spherical shell at the surface of the core gives physical significance to the representation of
Vestine et al. (1947) of the secular variation field by a spherical surface distribution of
current. The presence of several vertical dipoles near the equator does not support the assumption
of a large toroidal field within the core (as this is zero at the equator), which is an essential
feature of Bullard’s (1949) dynamo theory of the main field and which arose out of his work
on the secular variation.
