The only contraction applicable to this is
UA, giving 6bd*, and there is not any contraction applicable to bd%. We revert therefore
to UA on b&, this gives de, and the only contraction applicable to this is UA, giving
©, There is not any contraction applicable to this, and the process is therefore com-
plete. It may be remarked that the example presents no instance of the contraction
PP'; in fact the only terms having a pro-antepenultimate are acde, in which A, P' arc
not contiguous letters, and bed*e, in which the penultimate is not a simple letter, s0 that
the contraction PP' is in each case excluded. It must be confessed that a considerable
amount of practice would be required before the process could be readily made use of.
