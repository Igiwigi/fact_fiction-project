to the steps by which the primitive ancestral set of Mammalian teeth has become

* This specimen is also referred to by Professor Frowsr in an address to the Odontological Society
(‘ Odontol. Soc. Trans.,’ vol. 3, 1871, p. 220), and he there, on the then unverified assumption that it
possessed a changing pm‘, made certain remarks on the probable direction of the evolution of a
Diphyodont dentition—remarks which all the evidence at my disposal most fully bears out.

¢ As Professor Frower has pointed out in his paper just quoted, the type-specimen of T'riconodon occisor,
Owen (figured op. cit., Pl. IV., fig. 2), found in the same beds, also shows traces of having had a changing
pm‘, the latter tooth being very markedly retarded in development, as if a milk predecessor had only
just been lost from above it. There seems, in fact, to be every reason to suppose that all the Purbeck
Polyprotodonts had a similar tooth-change, judging from such indications as may be gathered from the
relative positions of the teeth,

modified into the very various forms of modern dentition, and especially as to the
passage from the Marsupial to the Placental style of dentition.

The first and most fundamental question that arises is this :—Is the rudimentary
