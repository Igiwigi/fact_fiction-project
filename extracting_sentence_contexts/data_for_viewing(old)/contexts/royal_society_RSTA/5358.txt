1. The quest for exploration

A thin layer around the surface of Earth is teeming with life of huge diversity:
from micro-organisms to plants and animals, and even intelligent species. Up
to now, this forms the only known sample of life in the Universe. However,
observing the pinpoints of light on the night sky has probably always inspired
humans to speculate about the existence of other worlds. It is, therefore, not
surprising that there is a long history of thoughts about such a proposition (e.g.
[1-5]). Despite the fact that it is straightforward to imagine that stars other
than the Sun would also host planets, speculations turned into evidence only
fairly recently: in 1992, the first planet around a special type of stellar remnant,
namely pulsars, was found [6], and in 1995, the first detection of a planet around
a star of similar composition to the Sun, namely 51 Peg b, was reported [7]. The
enormous progress in this field is reflected by the fact that, as of 1 June 2010,
more than 450 extra-solar planets! are known. While most of these are gas giants
like Jupiter and Saturn, some spectacular discoveries of about 20 planets of less
