JF. It is to be observed that this
dynamical equation leaves out the purely local part of the electric force. The
propagation of radiation of ordinary wave-length is in fact an action involving the
medium in bulk, and not one of molecular type; thus in accordance with the
Younc-Poisson principle (infra ยง 47) the local part of the electric force, arising from
the surrounding molecules, is compensated intermolecularly by an influence on the
physical properties of the material medium which thereby become functions of the
density and strain, and this part therefore does not enter into the molar electric
forcive maintaining the radiation. These equations lead to

CVD = 2/d?
