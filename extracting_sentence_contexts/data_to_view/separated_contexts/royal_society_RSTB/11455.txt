The dating of the
assemblage is based on 18 AMS radiocarbon measurements on
17 left ulnae and 1 cranium, therefore representing an MNI of
17 individuals. The dates between 11200 and 10900 cal BP
indicate a use of the cave as a burial place in the transitional
period between Preboreal and early Boreal. This relatively
short time span and the fact that subadult individuals,
especially small children, are underrepresented, could indicate
that the cave was selectively used as a burial place by a larger
group or by several smaller groups over 100 or 200 years. Similar radiocarbon dates have been found at two skulls
and a mandible from a sandpit at Greylake, Somerset, UK
(table 2). The human remains including postcranial fragments
representing a minimum of five individuals were excavated
in 1928, but dated only recently to the early Boreal.
