Scells and the pattern in which they are arranged to form each grid. It will, however, be
Sidentical for all micro-states for any assigned shape and size of grid. Serial numbers
§(1,2, 3,...,¢,..., W”) may be allotted to the set of N’ grids in any form necessary.*

of the ny basic cells which constitute the grid. Any statistic (in the Fisherian sense) in terms
Sof these n, values of z belonging to the same ¢th grid may now be constructed. Any such
Bstatistic may be written as, say, u{Gr(O, 9)}, where Gr(O, m)) indicates that ny basic cells
speach of size (1) are arranged in a certain definite configuration, and u,{Gr(O, o)} indicates
€ that the statistic in question has to be constructed from the n, values of z drawn in the form
sof the specified grid. For the sth micro-state there will be N’ such values (given by
t= 1,2,..., N’) which forms a frequency distribution of the given statistic for the sth micro-
‘8 state. The fact that all these values belong to the sth micro-state is explicitly indicated by the
@suffix s in the form u,{Gr(O, vp)}, where ¢ goes from 1 to N’ for any particular value of s,

and s goes from 1 to N. These NN’ values of u,,{Gr(O, %o)} form a complete set of sample values

Sway. Such a value of the statistic will be written as u{R(O, )} to distinguish it from
2 u,{Gr(O, no)}- As O, or the size of the basic cell, will be fixed in any given situation it is not
