variation of that element is chiefly derived. In our present ignorance of the physical
agency by which the periodical magnetic variations are produced, the possibility of
the discovery of some cosmical connection which may throw light on a subject as

yet s0 obscure, shonld not be altogether overlooked. As the snn must be recognised
as at least the primary source of all magnetic variations which conform to a law of
local hours, it seems not unreasonable that in the case of other variations also, whether
of irregular occurrence or of longer period, we should look in the first instance to any
periodical variation by which we may learn that the sun is affected, to see whether
any coincidence of period or epoch is traceable. Now the facts of the solar spots, as
they have been recently made known to us by the assiduous and systematic labours
of ScuwaBE, present us with phenomena which appear to indicate the existence of
some periodical affection of an outer envelope, (the photosphere,) of the sun ; and it is
certainly a most striking coincidence, that the period, and the epochs of minima and
maxima, which M. Scawase has assigned to the variation of the solar spots, are abs0-
lately identical with those which have been here assigned to the magnetic variations.
In the third volume of Kosmos, page 402 (Englisb translation, vol. iii. pp. 291 and
292), Baron von HumBoLpT has published a tabular abstract supplied by M. Scuwase,
of the results of that gentleman's obseryations of the solar spots from 1826 to 1850 ;
from which M. Scawass has derived the conclusion, that * the numbers in the Table
leave no room to doubt that, at least from the years 1826 to 1850, the solar spots have
Shown a period of about ten years, with maxima in 1828, 1837 and 1848, and minima
