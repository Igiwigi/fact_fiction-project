The logical distinction between masquerade and background
matching is that the former can, in principle, be effective even
if the animal is isolated and in plain sight: it is detected but
not recognized. In practice, the effectiveness of masquerade
depends on predators having learnt that the object being
mimicked is irrelevant, and it is more effective when
mimicked objects are present [23]. Therefore, masquerading
prey may often also benefit from background matching: a
stick insect is cryptic because it both looks like a stick and
blends with sticks. Some animals, most spectacularly octo-
puses, can mimic both different backgrounds and multiple
objects (e.g. [68,69]), and there is potentially a benefit both
of masquerade and the fact that the animal is encountered
in multiple forms, making its characteristic features harder
to learn. To our knowledge, this has not been investigated.

In the interests of convenience, the majority of experiments
on camouflage, and visual search more generally, consider
two-dimensional objects in a single depth plane. However,
most biologically relevant objects are three-dimensional, and
many interactions with them involve depth judgements. The
reconstruction of depth from the two-dimensional retinal
images is therefore a key stage in vision, both for assessment
of object shape and the relationships between objects in
space. One important cue comes from the patterns of shading
