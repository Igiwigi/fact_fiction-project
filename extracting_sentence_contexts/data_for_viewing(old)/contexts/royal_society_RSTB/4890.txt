The method of approach was obviously exceedingly crude, but it suggested
logarithmic plotting of the data. Further trial showed that the law did in fact hold


BASED ON THE CONCLUSIONS OF DR. J. C. WILLIS, F.RS. 41

very approximately, both for animals and plants, up to genera of 30 species or so, after
which the points began to drop away more or less rapidly from the line, i.e., the
observed frequencies of the larger genera were smaller than those suggested by the
law : figs. 2 and 3 (below, pp. 45, 46) bring out the point very well. The approximation
was, however, sufficiently close to encourage further work. As will be seen from the
following, the fundamental mistake was the notion that time might be regarded for
practical purposes as infinite : it must in fact be regarded as quite short.

I. Tue Frequency Disrrreution ror Sizes oF GENERA (DERIVED AND
PRIMORDIAL) WHEN TIME Is FINITE.

If time is finite we can no longer, as at the beginning of Section IT, ignore the number
of prime genera as compared with the number of derived genera. At time T, out of
unit total, we will have ge~” dx derived genera of age x, together with e~” of age T—the
term which vanishes if T is infinite.

To obtain the required frequency distribution there will, therefore, be two corrections
to make to the limiting distribution (12). (a) We must add to each term of (12) the
corresponding term of (5) (writing T for ¢) multiplied by e~*. (b) We must subtract
