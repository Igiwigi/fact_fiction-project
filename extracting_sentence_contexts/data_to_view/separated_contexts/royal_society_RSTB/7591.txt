Quite unlike any unitary organisms, a large part of the body
of some modular organisms is the accumulated ‘necromass’ of dead modules. It is this feature
that gives trees, corals and mosses their peculiar role in creating structure in a community:
forests, coral reefs and peat bogs have a community architecture that is an accumulation of
dead modules bearing a thin skin of active feeding modules (polyps or leaves). The fact that
most modular organisms occupy fixed positions in space means that they give a continuity to
the spatial structure of communities that mobile unitary organisms cannot do. An organism that is fixed in position in its habitat depletes resources locally. It cannot escape
from the resource depletion zones that is creates except by growing away from them.
