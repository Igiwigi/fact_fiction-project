CellNet is a
publicly available network-biology platform (http: //cellnet.
hms.harvard.edu/) written by Patrick Cahan with input
from Hu Li and Edroaldo Lummertz de Rocha that has
been tested extensively against both published datasets [23]
and used within our own laboratory to enhance the in vitro
production of several cell types [24]. At its core, CellNet is
founded on the notion that cell- and tissue-specific gene
