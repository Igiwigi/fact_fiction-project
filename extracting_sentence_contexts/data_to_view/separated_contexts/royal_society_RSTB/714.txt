These contents (whether
specks, rods, or filaments), are not necessarily symmetrically disposed in their investing
substance; they may be central in the latter, or axile, and equidistant from the
contour throughout, and following all the coils, turns, twists, &c. of the investment
(Plate 13, figs. 6 and 7); or the specks, rodlets, or filaments may be excentric (Plate 13,
figs. 6, c, and 8) or partly exserted (fig. 6, 6), or absent from one part or the other. Tt
will simplify matters if I say at once that the brilliant refractive contents, just
described, are the Bacterium we are concerned with, in various stages of development ;
while the paler investment is a peculiar swollen gelatinous sheath, which envelopes
the organism. AND THE ORGANISMS COMPOSING IT. 151

Mingled with the objects referred to are large numbers of minute spheroidal specks,
and rods of various lengths, and perhaps (but not always) some longer filaments—in
fact, cocci, bacteria, bacilli, and leptothrix-forms, &c., to use the current phraseology. These are unquestionably naked * Schizomycetes (Plate 13, figs. 3 and 8) from their
form, reactions, the stages of division which they present, and from their behaviour in
cultivations. Tt is now easy to see how natural were the questions—Have these naked forms
anything in common with the sheathed cocci, rodlets, filaments, &c., above referred
to?
