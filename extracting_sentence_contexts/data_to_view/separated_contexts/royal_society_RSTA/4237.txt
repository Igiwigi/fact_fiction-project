By definition, to be an OS, every pair of atoms of the form (i,j) and
(k,j) are required to see precisely the same atomic environment up to orthogonal transformation. To see that this is true of the structures above, we superimpose the undistorted lattice of austenite
on the reference configuration. In fact, the method of visualization used in these figures with
a fine array of dots is consistent with the OS definition—we simply ensure that the dots are
points of the reference lattice of austenite. Then, following the Cauchy—Born rule [22], we use the
calculated zero-energy deformation to transport the atomic positions. This leads to both reference
and deformed configurations being perfect objective structures.
