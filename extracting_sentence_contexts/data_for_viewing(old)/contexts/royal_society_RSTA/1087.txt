measurement. This is one of the reasons why the assumption of the independent existence or reality
of quantum objects or something in nature to which one can relate by this concept becomes
important for Bohr’s analysis of the EPR experiment and of the question of locality in it. This
independent existence or reality ensures the possibility of this measurement. However, once
this alternative measurement is performed, the original prediction becomes meaningless as in
principle unverifiable. To put it another way, even a prediction with probability one is still only an
assignment of probability and does not mean that the quantity thus predicted is real. Indeed, this

ensembles and not of individual events [24, p. 205].


fact in effect disables EPR’s criterion of reality. However, because the measurement corresponding
to the EPR prediction of P, if it is performed on Sz, always yields the predicted value, their
criterion may be seen as applicable insofar as such a measurement is possible to verify. Performing
an alternative, complementary, measurement of Q on S2 irrevocably preclude such a verification.
This implies that both quantities in question could never be experimentally ascertained for the
same object and hence that QM could not be shown to be non-local by EPR’s logic any more than it
can be shown to be incomplete by their logic. The application of EPR’s criterion of reality becomes
‘ambiguous’ by virtue of the lack of qualifications required by impossibility of considering the
behaviour of quantum objects independently of their interaction with measuring instruments
[9, p- 700].

Nevertheless, Einstein’s criticism made Bohr and others, and still make us, to confront the
question whether nature would allow us to do more. Einstein thought it should. Bohr’s, more
