There is not a great deal of experimental confirmation of the behaviour of : =

zero, there is work on helium [14,23], as illustrated in figure 1 for helium 4. In fact, the behaviour i>
of the sublimation curve approaching the origin of zero temperature and pressure tangentially to : <
the temperature axis, in agreement with the thermodynamic argument presented above, has been : >
used to determine temperatures below 5 K from the saturated vapour pressure of liquid helium. 138

5. Localized excitations: solitons and discrete breathers 8

The initial work of Fermi, Pasta, Ulam and Tsingou looked at low-frequency (long wavelength)
excitations of the chain of atoms. The responses of the system, the localized excitations in the
form of successive recurrences of states where energy was concentrated in one oscillator, were
established to be solitary travelling waves, now termed solitons.
