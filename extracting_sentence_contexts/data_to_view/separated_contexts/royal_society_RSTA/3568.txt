For the sake of a better visualization, only
the time evolution of the shear stress on the segments 1, 5 and 8 is shown; the shear stress evolution behaviour in the other
segments is similar.

in conditions when the ventricles are small or in the case where the catheters are placed in
close proximity to the ventricular wall. For this reason, it is also difficult to investigate different
volumes of CSF which might cause different flow forces and pulsatility to the VC lumen and
perforations. In these circumstances, particularly, it is important to mention the fact how precise
VCs should be placed in the middle of the ventricle without contact to adjacent tissue. This
situation is usually more difficult in cases with small ventricles compared those with large ones. In this context, the results given in this study disclosed that sheer stress is magnified in proximal
catheter perforations compared with the more distal holes.
