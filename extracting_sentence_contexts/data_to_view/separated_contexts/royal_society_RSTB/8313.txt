If untreated, it is fatal in half of all cases. Of the twelve serotypes of N. meningitidis,
six are epidemic (A, B, C, W135, X and Y). Conjugate polysaccharide vaccines are available for four serotypes (A, C, W135, Y);
for serotype B polysaccharide vaccines cannot be developed due to antigenic similarity with a polysaccharide in human
neurological tissues (vaccines based on outer membrane proteins are used instead; WHO fact sheet). In 2010 and 2011
more than 55 million persons aged 1 to 29 years in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger received conjugate vaccine that reduces
carriage and transmission. It is thought that high coverage in this age group can eliminate meningococcal A epidemics in
sub-Saharan Africa, but the main challenges are achieving and maintaining vaccine coverage [24].
