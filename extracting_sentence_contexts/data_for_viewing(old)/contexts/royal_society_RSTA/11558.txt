temperature of about 900° C., illustrate the kind of thing that occurs. The wire.
which was 0°2 millim. in diameter, was maintained at a potential of +40 volts, the
pressure of the oxygen being atmospheric, All the conditions were kept constant ;
the unavoidable variation in the temperature of the wire was continuously registered
by the galvanometer spot, and was not sufficient to cause a variation of 5 per cent.
in the value of the leak. Nevertheless, readings at 2-minute intervals gave the
following values for the current :—146, 180, 178, 228, 158, 170, 150, 246, 166, 324,
198, 174, 198.

Naturally the existence of a variability of this kind makes it very difficult to find
out what is the real effect of changing the controllable conditions, and the author has
spent a great deal of time in trying to get rid of it. In this he has been unsuccessful.
It looks, in fact, as though this variability is in some way or another an inherent
part of the phenomena. In some respects it seems to follow definite laws. It is
more marked at high than at low pressures, and at low than at high temperatures.
The positive leak at temperatures above 1200° C. seemed to show very little variability.
It is not due to trivial variations in the state of the gas in the tube, as the negative
leak, measured under the same conditions as the positive, did not show it. For the
same reason it cannot be due to discharges from points which might form on the
surface of the platinum.

It was found to be present whatever the voltage on the filament. Boiling out the
tube with nitric acid and distilled water left it unaffected. Slightly heating the walls
of the tube with a Bunsen burner did not affect it, although heating the walls more
strongly was found to give the big leak mentioned on p, 19. The big leak thus
