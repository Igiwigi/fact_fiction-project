By contrast, the excited
state coherence is considered to be non-impulse and is purely displacement driven. A typical
situation considers the on-resonance excitation with a femtosecond pulse and laser spectrum that
is narrower than the absorption line width. In this case, the total coherence, comprising of position
and impulse, could, in fact, be minimized. With off-resonance excitation, the resulting ground
state coherence could be multiple times the minimized value. This demonstrates that position,
impulse and phase can be controlled by the carrier frequency, laser pulse power and electronic
lifetime and dephasing properties [34].
