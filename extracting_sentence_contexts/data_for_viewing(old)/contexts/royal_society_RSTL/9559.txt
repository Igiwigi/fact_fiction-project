means state that snch is the case with the corresponding elements in the Pig ; in fact,
a striking uniformity in the contour of these cells is observable, by far the greater
proportion taking the form of an elongate pyramid, the few exceptions occurring being
usually gigantic spindles. They resemble closely, both in size and form, the large
pyramidal cells at the deepest portion of the third layer in Bimana, Quadrumana, and
the large Carnivora, as also the ganglion cells in the parietal and tempero-sphenoidal
lobes of Man. Nowhere do we find the irregular, swollen, and at times almost
globose cells 80 frequent in the motor area of the human brain. How is it possible, it
may be asked, to discriminate between these cells and those of the third layer if they
approach them 80 closely in size and contour? In the first place, their arrangement
in nests is indicative of their true significance ; in the next place, their abrupt com-
mencement is indicative of a layer distinct from the third ; and, lastly, of still greater
import to my mind is the fact that in those regions marked by a six-laminated type
the belt of angular cells becomes interposed between this layer of cells and the third
layer. To summarise, therefore, we may state that the ganglionic layer in the Pig
consists of cells which, whilst arranged in clusters corresponding to the nests of BETz

in the human subject, conform in 8ize and configuration to the lowest pyramidal cells
of the third layer in Man (Plate 7).
