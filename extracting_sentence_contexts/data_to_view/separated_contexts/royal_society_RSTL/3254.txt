The appearance of the globules in question suggests the idea that they may be
identical with the s0-called © lymph-granules,” or blood-corpuscles of the © second
form.”

hypothesis that the development of smaller vesicles within itself is a normal property of the ordinary coloured
vesicle or hlood-disc, yet the obscurity which still hangs over the origin and reproduction of the blood-discs,
and the unexpected constaney of the granulated form in a greater oc less proportion of them, while recent, and
floating in the serum, in the different species examined, makes me unwilling to suppress an idea, naturally
arising out of such observations, and likely to be suggestive of examination of the same appearance by other
microscopical observers.” At the time of recording the above obseryations, I was not aware that such an idea
had been published. I shall be glad if those observations are 8uch as to confirm it. There is one fact men-
tioned by Owev which I think particularly deserving of attention here. In describing the blood of a cold-blooded
animal—the Monitor—he remarks, © many of the discs had the marginal contour slightly crenate, with lines
converging to the nucleus.” —The appearance of the blood-dise when undergoing the changes which we have
seen to terminate in a separation into globules, seems to have been noticed by several observers; among whom
may be mentioned Hewsox and FaLcovar, and more recently Hopoxiv and Lisrer. It is not easy, indeed,
to understand how the sharp-sighted Lzzuwtxnork should have suspected the ** globules” of the blood
to be made of 8ix lesser globules, unless he had seen some of the appearances in question.
