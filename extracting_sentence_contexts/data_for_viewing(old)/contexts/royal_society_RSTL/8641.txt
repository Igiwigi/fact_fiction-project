in December, the latter in June or July, the two hill-stations (Darjeeling and Simla
have two maxima and two minima, like places on the Atlantic coast of Purope.
epochs of the maxima and minima are, however, very different in the two cases.
absolute minimum of the year at these hill-stations coincides with that on the ane

and is doubtless due to the same cause ; but the absolute maximum falls in Novem!

at the former, and is followed by a fall, at first rapid, and gradually decreasing till March,
A small rise then takes place, which brings the mean pressure of April above that
February; it is, however, only temporary, and in May and June the pressure falls
rapidly to its minimum.

* The facts thus indicated relative to the effects of temperature and vapour in affecting pressure 8eem to
explain the apparent anomalies that haye led some authors, especially Mr. Lav@nros (Phys. Geog. pp. 120,
123), to question the soundness of Havrer's theory of the trade-winds, Theso are, that winds do not blow
centripetally toward the Sahara, the Arabian Desert, the interior of Australia, &c., all of them dry regions with
a day temperature yery much aboye that of the neighbouring seas. In the first place Mr. Lavenzox has, |
think, insufficiently considered the fact that a high day temperature in these dry regions generally alternat
with a low night temperature, the nocturnal radiation þeing intensified by the same conditions which
increase the incident solar heat; 80 that the mean temperature of the 24 hours, one element of importance

in determining the general system of the winds in such regions, is frequently below that of places with a m
lower day temperature. £xz. gr., Lahore in April has a mean maximum diurnal temperature of 98%4,
one of 93%5; but the mean temperature of the 24 hours is only 791 at Lahore, while at Calcutta it is 849,
Further, the facts discussed in the text and tabulated at pages 589, 608, 609, show that in a dry atmosph of
