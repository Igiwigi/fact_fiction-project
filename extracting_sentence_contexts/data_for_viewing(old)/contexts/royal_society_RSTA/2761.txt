trapped energy current, pretty much analogous to a capacitor!


4. Mathematical models for energy-modulated computing

(a) Modelling Wakefield experiment in Petri-nets

In this section, I would like to make a brief excurse to a computational model called Petri nets.
The name that this model bears is attributed to Prof. Carl Adam Petri, whose work [24] on causal
models of information processing and communication using a graphical formalism of condition-
event nets in the 50s and early 60s had led to a significant amount of research and applications
in computer science and beyond. Petri nets have a very clear distinction between locality and
nonlocality. In fact, in Petri nets, one can express cause-effect relationship between discrete events
in a very succinct form, even if one has many events occurring concurrently and independently
in space. I spent nearly 40 years studying different types of Petri nets and their semantics and
applying Petri nets to the analysis and design of electronic systems.

What is a Petri net? It is a bipartite directed graph [25] with nodes being either places (denoted
by circles) or transitions (denoted by bars). Sometimes places are also called conditions and
transitions are called events. The arcs of the graph, called a flow relation, can only go from
places to transitions and transitions to places. These arcs define the causality relation between
transitions, i.e. events, via places. Places, transitions and arcs define the structure of the net.
A Petri net can produce a dynamic behaviour, which is defined by the initial position of token
in some places (called initial marking or initial state) and some rules of a ‘token game’, i.e. the
method according to which the current marking can change into the following marking and thus
