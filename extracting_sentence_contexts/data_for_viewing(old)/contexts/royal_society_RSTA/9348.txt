dispersion and absorption of his instrument. Kornta’s* values given are those
recalculated by NurtinG, and in this case also the energy distribution was not directlyt
measured. Hovusron’st values are the mean of those obtained by a number of
observers and the energy was again calculated. It is fairly evident that in this case
some serious error has been made in determining the energy distribution. At first
sight it looks as if the intensity of the spectrum used by Houston was so low
that he was dealing mainly with rod vision. That this is not the true explanation is
shown by the fact that he also publishes results obtained with a much less intense
spectrum, and the maximum he obtains for this rod visibility curve is as much below
