But it is possible to employ liquid
ethylene, cooled either by external application of liquid air, or by causing it to boil
Sunder reduced pressure; both these means of obtaining a known low temperature
3 have been used, but only a small range of temperature is thus covered. The results,
*B Moreover, were not so trustworthy as those obtained when a liquid of known boiling-
point, boiling under atmospheric pressure, was used as a refrigerant.

3 The plan adopted, therefore, was to determine the pressure corresponding to certain
known temperatures, and then by means of the formula suggested by Ramsay and
Youne,* the accuracy of which has been demonstrated in a great number of instances,
to ascertain the vapour-pressures at intermediate temperatures. This method
depends on the fact that the ratios of the absolute temperatures of two liquids
corresponding toa series of pressures are a linear function for one of them corre-
sponding to the same pressures. It therefore becomes possible to calculate a whole
series of vapour-pressures of any substance, if the pressures are corresponding to two
or more temperatures accurately known ; the application is briefly as follows :—

The vapour-pressures of the substances are determined at absolute temperatures
