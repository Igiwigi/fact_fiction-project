in a very warm room the interval ought to be shorter. Practice must inform the
experimenter on this point. 'The reheating must always occur before the infusions show
the slightest tendency to change.
In the early days of February a closed chamber of six tubes was treated in the manner
here described. Three of the tubes were charged with strong turnip and the three
< others with strong artichoke-infusion. After two days discontinuous heating night and
S morning, they were allowed to remain undisturbed in the warm room. The six tubes
Â© remain perfectly brilliant to the present hour.
E On the 12th of February a closed chamber of three tubes was charged with cucumber-
& infusion. Heated discontinuously in the manner described, and abandoned afterwards
5 to a warm temperature, the three tubes remained perfectly sterile.
= Any process competent to sterilize very old hay can sterilize with greater ease any
a other infusion. The fact, therefore, that only a few days ago three closed chambers
= charged with our most refractory hay-infusions were sterilized by discontinuons heating
= proves the power of the method over infusions of all kinds.
By this method very instructive comparative experiments might be made, and the
.S resistant power of different germs might be expressed in terms of the heatings necessary
S for their sterilization. I possess, for example, two test-tubes, containing the same infusion
V and associated with the s2me closed chamber, one of which has been heated five times
= and the other s8ix. The former is quite turbid, while the latter is perfectly clear. In
2 this case five heatings had left some of the more resistant germs still unkilled, which
E were destroyed by the sixth heating. Of two other tubes charged with a different
Z infusion, one has been heated seven times and is now full of life ; the other has been
= heated eight times and is perfectly barren.
S With duecare the method of sterilization here described is infallible, however highly
