and Zea. They take up a fixed orientation in one but not in the other. Brink
and Cooper (1932) have recognized that segmental interchange in maize has not
led to the establishment of fixed complexes like those of Oenothera, and they point out
that the hypothesis of segmental interchange as applied to Oenothera by DARLINGTON
(1931) is inadequate to account for the persistence of the complexes and the failure
of crossing-over to take place in the middle portions of the chromosomes. They
attempt to account for this condition by the hypothesis that the medial portions of
the chromosomes are homologous but with reversed orientation. It has already
been pointed out, however, that in Oenothera meiotic chromosomes which are known
to be completely homologous throughout their length still pair only by their ends.
Some other explanation of this condition is therefore required. All are agreed that
the complex-differences in Oenothera are determined by the middle portions of the
chromosomes. That being so, the fact that the complexes and the phenotype
normally remain constant from generation to generation shows that crossing-over
does not normally occur in this region of the chromosomes. Obviously, therefore,
true chiasmata do not occur in this region of the chromosomes, except as occasional
occurrences leading to a change of catenation and a mutation.

From the considerable literature on catenation in Oenothera and its important
genetical results, only two papers need be cited here, CLELAND and BLAKESLEE
(1931) and Gares and Carcuestpe (1932). In these papers the chromosome
configurations in quite a large number of species and their hybrids have been con-
sidered. The results are all consonant with a theory of segmental interchange, and
it appears probable (Gares, 1933) that in nature both hybridization and segmental
interchange have been concerned in producing the condition in Oenothera in which
