same time it undergoes a sudden change of curvature at the vertex. In the annexed
figure (fig. 83) the dotted curve is the parabola which would be obtained when g = 0.
The other parabola ABCDE is the shifted parabola obtained when gq is not zero,
as explained already. But only the portion ABC appears on the plate, for the
axis OX cannot be disturbed by the presence of the new exponential factor, which
must also lessen the height of the curve to the value CX. What is actually seen
is ABC and its image in OX, or the shaded area in the figure bounded by two ares

of parabolas whose vertices are not at C, which therefore exhibits a sharp peak. In
fact, the original dotted parabola really consists of ares of two parabolas which
happen to be coincident when g = 0, and the analysis always applies only to one side
of the axis, as was emphasised earlier,

The interaction of two laws of energy distribution in a line, one being the simple
exponential law, could therefore explain the peaked appearance at the vertices of the
photographs, but it is incapable of explaining the nature of the curvature if the
other law is that of probability. It is evident on inspection of corresponding points
why one curve is flatter than the other, although the parabolas are equal.

On the supposition that H, is not complex in these experiments (a supposition
which is ultimately disproved), it is a matter of practical importance to isolate the
