Thus Q; depends in fact on the pair {—n), np} not on np alone. It can be observed that
the set of matrices having the representation of Q) (for some np € Ss?) give a way of embedding
the space of lines, namely the real projective plane RP”, into the space of Q-tensors Sp. We can thus
think of Q; taking values into RP? (in fact into RP! given the specific form of np as ny - e3 = 0). Moreover, one notes that the number k/2 for k even represents the number of times mp ‘winds’
around the circle dB, the topological degree of this map (see for instance [71]). Furthermore, one
can observe that if k is odd then mp(R cos y, R sing) = — lim,_,9 np(R cos((27 — €) + ¢), R(sin(2x —
€) + )) that is after a rotation of 27 around the circle dBr(0) there will be a discontinuity for
np.
