In the Proceedings of the Linnzan Society 1874, p. xxxiv, 1 have indicated the
evidence of Pringlea being a wind-fertilized member of a natural order most or all
the species of which are insect-ſertilized. These indications are the usual absence
of petals and disk-glands, the exserted anthers and long-tufted papill of the stigma,
to which is to be added the absence of winged insects in Kerguelen Island. In
reference to the las statement, it is a curious fact that wingless flies abound in the

island, and on this yery plant. WMoseley, Journ. Linn. Soe. xv., 54, in his notes on
Kerguelen botany, mentions an apterous fly as big as a blow-fly, nestling at the base
of the leaves of Pringlea and laying its eggs in the fluid which is caught there ;
every cabbage yielding ten or a dozen specimens. [Ie adds that he did not observe
whether it climbs to the inflorescence in sunny weather.

Mr. A. W. Bennett, Proc. Linn. Soc. 1874, xxxix., has described the pollen
of Pringlea as differing from that of nearly all other Crucifers in being much smaller
