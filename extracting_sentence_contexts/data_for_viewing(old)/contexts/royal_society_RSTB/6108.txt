In this connexion, attention may be called to three points, all of which provide evidence
for the view that segment 5 represents a transitional region between an anterior non-
vertebral part and a posterior vertebral part of the skull.

First, there is the well-known fact that in Cyclostomes, the skull occupies 4 segments
only, and the vertebre are only incipient. Were they to condrify as proper vertebra,
the foremost one would be in segment 5. Next, there is the fact that in the develop-
ment of the skull in Selachians, the notochordal sheath is invaded by the cartilage
cells of the parachordal from its hinder edge to a point opposite the middle of the
auditory capsules (vAN WIsJHE, 1922; DE Breer, 1931, a). Invasion of the sheath of
the notochord is a typical vertebral phenomenon, and that it should not occur in the
anterior region of the basal plate is evidence of the non-vertebral nature of this region.
Lastly, there is the fact that in almost all vertebrates (Anura and Dipnoi are the only
exceptions) a basicranial fenestra is present, 7.e., the anterior portions of the para-
chordals are entirely free from the notochord, and separated from it by a more or less
wide space, which again is totally different from the conditions of formation of vertebral
centra. It is difficult to estimate the extent of the region occupied by the basicrania]
fenestra, or in which in Selachians the notochordal sheath is not invaded, but it would
not be extravagant to assume that it corresponds to the first 4 segments.

The conclusion which we have reached is of interest from the historical as well as
from the theoretical point of view. When Huxiey (1858) annihilated Gorrun’s
and OKEn’s vertebral theory of the skull, he demonstrated the futility of attempting
to interpret the bony skull in terms of modified vertebra, and the vertebral theory
was replaced by the segmental theory. But since it is clear that true vertebra can
