again in accordance with the seeder use of the general table. The other methods of use

and similarly that Qi? = U (net mie all

of the table are direct applications of the various symmetry properties established in part VI
and of the definition relation (6).

The occurrence in the table of every U value, except the simple unity values mentioned
above, is a consequence of the fact that all canonical arrangements of a, 4, etc., are tabulated
and that any desired value of U can be taken as equal to one of these by the symmetry rela-
tions. The form of the associated rules of obtaining required V and W values shows how
any of these may be obtained directly or by a simple multiplication. These latter rules have
been justified, and it merely remains to describe and justify the method of evaluation of
the U coefficients.

4, â€˜THE THEORY OF THE AUTOMATIC COMPUTATION PROCEDURES

The two essential stages in the calculation of the U coefficients are the calculation of the
X coefficients and the calculation of each U coefficient in terms of these. The method used
here for the second of these processes is related to the corresponding calculations in part VI,
but the method used there for the X coefficients is not suitable for automatic computation
