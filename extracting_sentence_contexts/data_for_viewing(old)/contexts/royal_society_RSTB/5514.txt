that are presumably plants on the same piece of rock. The interesting and important
questions of the nature of the plants from these lower horizons and their association
with Silurian animal fossils must be left, until collecting shall have provided adequate
material for investigation. It must be borne in mind that the localities are situated in
very difficult country. Further and more critical evidence is required before the
geological age of the plant-containing strata can be regarded as clearly established.

We mention these points in order to make it quite clear that in the present paper
we are not dealing with these lower horizons. None of the plants we have as yet seen
from them are determinable, though some are of striking size and appearance. The
present description of some well-characterised and determinable fossil plants from a
higher horizon in the Walhalla Series, that of the Centennial Beds, is a contribution of
fact, which will require to be taken into consideration along with data regarding the
animal fossils in dealing with the stratigraphical question as a whole.

There appears to be general agreement that strata in a number of localities where
fossil plants are relatively abundant are situated high in the Walhalla Series. This
applies to the Centennial Mines, the beds at Wood’s Point and those at Gaffney’s
Creek, from all of which specimens were recorded in our earlier paper. It applies also
to the North Road Quarry, about one mile from Walhalla, from which the fossil plants
that form the subject of this paper have been obtained. This locality is thus referred
to in Prof. Skeat’s paper (1928, p. 226) :—

“No. 4 locality shows the Centennial beds north of Walhalla township, and according
to Mr. BaraGWaNaTH, is 8,000-10,000 feet stratigraphically above the basal conglo-
