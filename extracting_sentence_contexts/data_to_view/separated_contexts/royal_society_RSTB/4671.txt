The only other forms that exhibit radiating calcified lamelle that belong
exclusively to the sheath-cartilage are the various species of Cestracion (fig. 21,
p- 370).* This is not, however, to be taken as necessarily implying close aflinity
with Heptanchus; indeed, the fact that the characteristic number of rays in
Heptanchus is six, while in Cestracion it is eight, tells rather against it. The
fossil genera, such as Pal@ospinax, that are commonly regarded as allied to
Cestracion, although their centra have no radiating calcified laminz, may possibly
be degenerate, but the more probable explanation is that they branched off from
the parental stock prior to the evolution in the Cestracionts proper of the calcified
lamellee external to the double cone.

The members of the family Carchariide agree with one another in the possession of
large, well calcified intermedialia, of perichondrial origin, not derived from the arch-
cartilage nor from the sheath-cartilage ; they also agree in the fact that the sheath-
cartilage bulges out towards and into the arch-bases, and includes a diagonally
placed calcified lamella in each outgrowth. The Lamnide and Odontaspididee agree among themselves, and differ from the
Carchariide in the great reduction, or absence, of diagonal outgrowths of sheath-
cartilage and their included calcified lamelle, and they differ further from the
Carchariide: in the intermedialia not being compactly calcified, but consisting largely
of cartilage. This cartilage of the intermediale is calcified on the faces that touch
the arch-cartilages, and usually contains within it several radiating lamelle
(Carcharodon, fig. 9, A, p. 356), although these last are wanting in Scapanorhynchus
(fig. 11, p. 358).
