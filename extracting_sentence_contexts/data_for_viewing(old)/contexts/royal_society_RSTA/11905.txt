Variation of Hydrogen,

Hydrogen rings have only been recorded in the spectrum of the corona on three
occasions—1871, 1875, and 1882; it is probable that the rings corresponding to
hydrogen seen in 1883 were produced by the chromosphere and prominences, since
they were not seen in the middle of totality. If the appearance of the hydrogen
rings in the corona have the same connection with the sun-spot period as the 1474 K
line, their presence in 1893 might have been expected. As they were not photo-
graphed in this eclipse, the appearance of hydrogen rings might be regarded as
subject to no law in relation to the sun-spot period, but, before coming to a decision
on this point, it is worth while to consider very carefully the differences in the
instruments employed in the various eclipses. To get at these facts Mr. Fowzur has
made a number of experiments to determine to what extent false rings may be
produced in the visible and photographic spectrum when a slitless spectroscope is
employed, similar to those produced photographically in the manner already

explained when certain plates are employed. A positive photograph of the corona
of 1893, some 6’ high, illuminated by a large gas flame or electric lamp, forms an
artificial eclipse, which has been viewed with instruments of different dispersions, at
a distance such that the diameter subtended an angle of about 32’. With a very
small dispersion, similar to that employed by Respiaut in 1871 in relation to the
