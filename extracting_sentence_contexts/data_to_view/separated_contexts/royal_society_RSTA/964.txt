In the spherical case, the inner and outer billiards are conjugated by the spherical duality. See [87]
for a survey. Let us also mention two other non-conventional billiard systems: projective billiards [88] and
symplectic billiards [89].

(i) Around the Birkhoff conjecture

It is a classical fact (see, for instance, [83] and references therein) that the billiard in an ellipse
is integrable: the interior of the table is foliated by caustics, the confocal ellipses. Likewise, the
billiard inside an ellipsoid is Liouville integrable; e.g. [90,91]. The following is known as the Birkhoff conjecture; see [92].
