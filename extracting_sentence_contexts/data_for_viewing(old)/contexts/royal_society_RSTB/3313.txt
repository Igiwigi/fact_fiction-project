during the production of this tissue from the primordial nucleus of the spore. It
would seem, therefore, that in the structure of the mature microspore Araucaria
exhibits another and notable peculiarity among recent Gymnosperms, An obvious
comparison which LopriorE makes is with the pollen-grains of Cordaites,§ but we
may recognise in this character, exhibited both by the Paleozoic .and recent
Gymnosperms, a closer approach to Pteridophytic ancestors. We do not, however,
admit that a simple type of male prothallus such as occurs in Sequoia, Taxodium and
Torreya necessarily constitutes an important criterion in estimating the relative
positions of genera in a natural system of classification. If Conifers had their
ancestry among Filicinean plants, we might reasonably expect to find in the more
primitive and older genera a closer approach to a less highly specialised type of
microspore. Miss Roserson,|| in her valuable contribution to our knowledge of the
genus Torreya, has referred to this point and, as a means of reconciling facts not in
accord with reasonable expectation, she has suggested an explanation which is

+ Lopriorr (1905). The structure of the microspores of the Araucariew will be dealt with by
Mr. R. B. THOMSON in a forthcoming paper.

t In some preparations which Mr. THoMsSON showed to one of us large pollen-tubes seen in sections of
ovules appeared to be multinucleate, but it did not seem certain that the structures regarded as pollen-
tubes might not be partially aborted megaspores. THOMSON’S interpretation has now been fully justified,
