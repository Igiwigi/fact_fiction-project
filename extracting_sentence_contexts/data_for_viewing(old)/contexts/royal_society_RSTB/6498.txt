doubtless occupied by the system of fine tubes. These were mostly decayed and
unrecognizable. They were best seen in one or two regions close to the periphery
of the core. Some of them are evident in the portion of one of these regions shown,
x 400, in fig. 46, Plate 10. The wide tubes are well seen in a portion of a longi-
tudinal section in fig. 47, Plate 10. They run longitudinally, sometimes bending
slightly and interlacing. Their walls are translucent, rather imperfectly preserved,
and may have lost in thickness ; they show no markings indicative of definite thicken-
ings. What appear to be transverse septa occasionally occur, but the preservation
is not sufficiently good to allow of more than passing notice of this ; one such
septum is seen in the figure near the top right-hand corner. At places slender
tubes were detected but they had mostly broken down.

It is not necessary to enter into any discussion here of the facts described above.
They afford the proof for Downtonian specimens of the known structure of
Prototaxites. Minor differences, for example as regards the proportion of the two
systems of tubes in the transverse section, may depend on specific differences, but
no attempt has been made to survey the fragments occurring throughout the
Downtonian from the systematic point of view. It does not appear advisable at

present either to establish a new species of Prototaxites for the Downtonian remains
or to attempt to place the material under any named form until more extensive
sections can be obtained. The remains are therefore recorded as Prototaxites, sp,
