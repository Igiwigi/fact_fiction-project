* Several of the conclusions of the present section have been previously arrived at by Professor
Lame (‘ Hydrodynamics,’ chapter viii.); but, on account of the important light which they throw on the
later sections, I have thought it desirable to treat the questions in some detail, even at the risk o
repeating what is already well known,

annual tides will be quite inappreciable, and we may take the above series as giving
a good representation of the solar long-period tides, unless the effects of friction
become important for such tides.

The fact that when the period of the disturbing force is increased without limit
the free surface does not tend to approach its equilibrium form appears at first
sight to be at variance with the general laws of oscillating systems. The explanation
of this apparent anomaly may perhaps be made clear by considering a simple form
of “ gyrostatic” system which possesses only two degrees of freedom. In the absence
of frictional forces, the general equations of motion of such a ays may; by a proper
choice of coordinates, be expressed in the form

a — oy + nx = X,
y + wx + my = Y*

Here x, y denote the generalized coordinates of the system. Of the terms on the
left, the terms a, y are due to inertia, the terms wy, wx are described by 'THomson
