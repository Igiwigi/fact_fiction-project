These coefficients, taken together with the appropriate Wigner coefficients, then determine
the [42]«LM, component of the product representations #4) 4% (9, and AH (99; * Hig)
of the group U3.

The functions (B) and (C) are neither symmetrical nor antisymmetrical in particles
5 and 6, so that L, takes on both even and odd values appropriate to both the representations
Hy, and #,,,, of Us. Since we know, however, the matrix of P;, for these functions, from
the form of the Young-Yamanouchi standard orthogonal representation, we may construct
from them two linear combinations which are respectively symmetrical and antisymmetrical
with respect to P;,, and which belong then respectively to the representations % ,, and 4 ;,).
