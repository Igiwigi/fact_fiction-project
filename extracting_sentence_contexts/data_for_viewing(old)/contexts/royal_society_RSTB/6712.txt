S.3.R. (Plate 17)—The sulcus lunatus is a curved sulcus placed well out on the
lateral surface. Superiorly it is superficially joined with the sulcus occipitalis
transversus, resembling to some extent the condition of §.9.R. Sulci praelunatus

et paramedialis are present. The general direction of the folding of the striate
cortex is horizontal.

C.2.R. (Plate 32)—The lunate sulcus is a fully curved sulcus which extends well
on to the lateral aspect of the hemisphere. The drawings give the appearance of
the sulcus extending to the medial border and actually passing on to the medial
surface. This extensive sulcus is, however, composed of three different parts.
Although their points of separation are quite definite, some facts, such as the extent
to which the sulcus occipitalis transversus is buried, are difficult to determine because
the hemisphere is somewhat cracked from handling. Although it is necessary to
state this, there is very little doubt concerning the arrangement. The sulcus lunatus
at its lower end sweeps backwards towards the occipital pole and comes to lie under

a typical sulcus calcarinus externus. At its upper and inner end it is confluent with
what appears to be the outer limb of the sulcus occipitalis transversus, but it is
possible that the whole of this sulcus may be buried, as the floor of the sulcus is
somewhat injured and definition is not possible. Just medial to the point of contact
