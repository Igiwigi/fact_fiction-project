For example, the British Standards Institute has already proposed a
standard for the ethical design of robotic devices (BSI BS 8611:2016 Robots and robotic devices);
there are also multiple IEEE standards (https://ethicsinaction.ieee.org/) projects in this area. Should regulation lag behind or prove difficult, establishing standards may be a soft approach
to the topics of data governance and privacy. In fact, this type of approach may well mirror
suggestions offered by Reed [5] in this issue.

Human behaviour is often the subject of data collection. Savings in terms of costs and general
utility will no doubt accrue after further application of analytics to this type of data.
