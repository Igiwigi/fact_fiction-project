dust rises in this cleft, it tumbles out on its lower or southern lip, where it is
hemmed in by walls of rock on all sides but one. We can easily see that these are
powerful factors in determining the path along which the blast will travel. But it
has also been stated* that on the north side of the crater there are visible passages
descending obliquely through the rocks of the mountain, and it is from these the
avalanche of sand is launched in a direction which is nearly horizontal. That may
be so, but even in that case it is not stated that these fissures are above the southern
lip, or that they can emit blasts inclining downward at an angle of 12 to 20 degrees
from the horizontal. And if from these fissures the dust-cloud is shot obliquely
upwards so as to graze the southern rim of the fissure, it still remains to be
explained why the cloud sinks down again and flows.over the surface of the ground,
refusing to rise in the air and float away as an ordinary cloud would certainly do.
This, in fact, merely postpones the difficulties, and does not settle them. Moreover, if
such an explanation were possible at Pelée, it would have no bearing whatever on the
eruptions of the Soufriére, as there the crater is a vast bowl about half as deep as it
is broad ; the black cloud could never have been shot obliquely from the bottom of
this, down the mountain side, but must have risen nearly vertically into the air,

The explanation proposed by Professor Jaccart is of a different kind: “ These
horizontal blasts are not hard to account for, and do not require a horizontal nozzle
to project them. They are simply the effect of the down blast after the heavy gravel
has begun to fall, acting against the upblast from the throat of the volcano, and both
together deflected and thrown into terrific whirls or tornadoes by the prevailing wind,
which on Mont Pelée is north-east.” He would, in fact, account for them by the
resistance which the sand and lapilli falling through the air offered to the ascent of
