Patients performed below the cut-offs
in number comprehension, transcoding and written oper-
ations (particularly in subtraction and multiplication). Lesion analyses also showed that typical spatial errors (e.g.
omissions of the left-most digits, misalignment, number
inversions, etc.) were associated with extensive lesions in
fronto-temporoparietal areas, frequently associated with
neglect. By contrast, purely arithmetical errors (e.g. failure
to recall basic number facts, to carry, to borrow, etc.) were
related to more confined lesions in the lower parietal lobe,
particularly in the right angular gyrus and its proximity. Regression models revealed that spatial errors were mainly
predicted by composite measures of visuo-spatial attentional
and representational abilities. By contrast, specific errors of
arithmetical nature were not predicted by visuo-spatial abil-
ities.
