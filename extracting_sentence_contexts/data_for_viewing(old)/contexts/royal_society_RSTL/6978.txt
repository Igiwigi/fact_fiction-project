Reducing the others in the same manner, we are struck with the coincidence of these
values with those really found for the annealed wires by experiment; in fact we must
asxume that the values deduced for the conducting-power of metals are those of the
-annealed wires, even when hard-drawn ones are experimented with. What the deduced
yalues for the conducting-power would be when using annealed wires of impure metals
we are unable at present to say, for no determinations have been made in this direction.
It, must be remembered that the effect of annealing on the conducting-power of alloys
is very small, 80 that the deduced values from those found for the annealed wires would
not be very different from those deduced from the hard drawn, as8uming, as we have
done in the former part of this investigation, that the percentage decrement in the con-
ducting-power between 0® and 100® of hard drawn and annealed is the same.
Having thus proved that, by using the expression
