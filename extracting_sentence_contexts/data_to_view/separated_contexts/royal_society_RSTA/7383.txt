Fortunately, the number of these required was the smallest, and table 2 contains
most of the values required for calculations up to the 3d shell. A method which is fairly
direct, and as good as all the others examined, is to consider a term ABO(e, m,) C(m,),
where A, B, C denote connected sets of eigangs with first values a, b, c, and to expand this
numerically in two ways

ABO(e, my) C(my) = > X(d,m, + mg, €, ¢, m,) ABG(e) CO(d, m, +m), (14)
and a
ABO(e,m,) C(mg)
= X X(¢,m,, a, b, ms) A(ms) B(m, —ms) C(ms)

= Y X(e,m,, a,b, ms) X(f,m, + m,—ma, b, c,m,—ms) A(ms) BCO(f, m, +m,—ms)
ng

ms,

~2 Y(f, d) A[BCO(f)] O(d, m, + m,). (15)

These two expressions, evaluated numerically by means of the X tables, are equal, and by
theorem 2, part IV, the eigang terms with corresponding eigang values can be equated
so that it follows

ABO(e) CO(d, m, +m) = ~ Y(f,d)/X(d, m, + my, e, c,m,) ALBCO(f)] O(d,m,+m,). (16)

But these coefficients are just the U(a,b,c,d|e, f) by the definition of the latter. Values of these coefficients are given in table 2, where it will be seen that a numerical
check is provided by the fact that each subtable represents an orthogonal transformation
and so different columns are orthogonal.

The W coefficients are used in one of the most fundamental relations for the reduction of
Schrédinger matrix elements between vector-coupled functions. They were defined by
a formula involving a double summation of products of X coefficients, but it is simpler to
evaluate them by a modification of the relation in which they are used, and which was proved
to be a consequence of the definition.
