whole and in some a hypertrophy of the ventral stolonic vessel, on the one hand,
and an extension and narrowing of the body to form a post-abdomen containing
all the viscera but the gut-loop on the other.

VIâ€”AScCENT OF THE VISCERA

Other ascidians, however, have evolved from the cionid type in a very different
direction. In most of these there has been an elaboration of the branchial sac,
associated in all probability with increase in absolute body size, since such increase
demands a relatively greater increase of respiratory and feeding surfaces. The
branchial sac tends to extend posteriorly between the gut-loop and the heart, and
in adult forms these two structures become separated from one another and
lie on opposite sides of the pharynx. There is, in fact, not only an extension of
the branchial sac posteriorly, but also a dislocation or migration forwards of the
gut-loop and associated gonads, and the heart and pericardium.

With increase in individual body size and hypertrophy of the branchial sac the
fixation stalk dwindles even to a greater extent than it does in Ciona. In the
Ascidiidae short sub-terminal ampullae apparently represent the stalk shortly after
metamorphosis, but not for long. In the families of the Stolidobranchia (Ptycho-
branchia) the stalk again is recognizable in some species during or shortly after
metamorphosis, but either it is without obvious function as in Botryllus, Symplegma,
or Distomus, or it forms a creeping stolon-like structure as in certain Molgulae and
in Styela and Polycarpa (BERRILL, 1929, 1931). In many species (Botryllus, Symplegma,
