With reference to Experiment A it will be noticed that the exposure of the skin
with normal direction of current to the action of CO, leads to a diminution of
the E.M.F., and finally to a temporary reversal of the direction of the current. A
recovery occurs upon the admission of air, but it is not in this case complete, for, as
will be seen by reference to the earlier stages of the experiment, a general fall of
E.M.F. is taking place, hastened later on no doubt by the action of the gas. In

fact the precipitations of E.M.F. induced by the CO, are seen to be imposed upon aâ€™
gentle curve of descent. If, on the other hand, Experiment B be examined, a case where at the com-
mencement the outer surface is positive to the inner, the following points will be
evident. In the first place the negativity of the inner surface is diminishing, a fact
that has already been alluded to in a previous section of this paper.
