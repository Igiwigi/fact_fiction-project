69. So far as the mean value of the abstract distribution is concerned the position is
clear. The mean value £{R(n))} based on random samples each consisting of np) values of z
is equal to the mean value £(1) of individual values of z except for a correcting term for cells
in the neighbourhood of the boundary of the field. I have discussed this correction in a
separate note attached as Appendix 6 to this Part.

70. The variance o?(n)) for samples each consisting of ny) values of z drawn at random is
also determinate, and can be easily calculated for any particular abstract distribution of z.
The variance (1) of the individual values of z is also, of course, known or can be easily
calculated for any particular distribution of z. In fact, under certain mild and well-known

restrictions, usually
o? (mo) = 07(1)/Mo; (70-1)

provided that n, is small compared to Nj, the total number of cells; otherwise there is a
correcting term. The above equation may also be written in the form

0? (No) /oo(1) = 1/M- (70-2)

71. Now go back to the variance for any particular, say, the sth micro-state or space-
frequency distribution belonging to the above abstract distribution of z. For configurational
sampling in the sth micro-state, 7?{Gr( )} has been used to represent the variance of in-
