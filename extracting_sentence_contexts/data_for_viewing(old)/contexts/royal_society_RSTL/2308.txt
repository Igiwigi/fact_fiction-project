IV. The Croonian Lecture for 1826. By Sir EvERarD Home,
Bart. V, P.R.S.

Read November 16, 1826.

Tax subject of the present Lecture, is an enquiry into the
mode by which the propagation of the species is carried on,
in the common oyster, and in the large fresh-water muscle.

Aided by Mr. Baver's microscopical observations, illus-
trated by his representations of the facts that were ascertained,
I have been enabled to lay before the Society many curious
particulars  respecting self-impregnating animals, which
could only be brought to light by an examination of the
organs of generation in the field of the microscope ; and
without the continuance of his assistance, I confess myself
unable to prosecute the enquiry.

It is now a period of five years since we entered upon the
present investigation, continuing it during the breeding seasons
of these two species of bivalves. Having at last brought our
labours to a 'satisfactory conclusion, I shall now detail the
observations we have made.
