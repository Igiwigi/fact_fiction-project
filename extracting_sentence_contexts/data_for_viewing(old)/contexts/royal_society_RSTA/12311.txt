its value being easily obtainable if ever wanted. The displacement of Fraunhofe
lines due to the Sun’s rotation is a small thing to detect with a prism spectroscop

smaller.

70. It may, perhaps, be well to check over our results by the less geometrica
method employed by Sir GrorGE SroKEs, viz., by expressing the fact that the inter:
section of the three waves (incident, reflected, and refracted) with the mirror is a joint
intersection, and runs along the mirror at a pace which can easily be written down
(viz., AC/t); for the wave-advances through the medium at a speed V, and th
medium helps it along with a component of its drift velocity v cos (@ + €); so th
total speed of the joint wave intersection as it runs along the mirror is

V + vcos (6 + e)

which it is easy to see is precisely the same as what we should have obtained by
attending to rays and to the figure, viz.,
