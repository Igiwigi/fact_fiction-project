metal is much more vivid than that reflected from the glass alone. The de-
struction of reflection at the common surface of two media of equal refractive
powers explains many curious phenomena, &c.” *

DR. BREWSTER ON REFLECTED LIGHT. 189

In the year 1814, when I was investigating the law of polarisation for light
reflected at the separating surface of different media#, I had occasion to in-
close oil of cassia between two flint glass prisms. 'The blue colour of the re-
flected light at first surprisxed me; but though the fact was new, and the ex-
periment itself interesting, the decompoxition of the light was obviously expli-
cable upon known principles. Although the refractive density of oil of cassia
exceeds greatly that of flint glass for the mean rays, yet the action of the two
bodies on the less refrangible rays is nearly the same ; and hence the red rays
must he in a great measure transmitted, while there will be reflected a small
portion of the orange, a greater portion of the yellow, a till greater proportion
of the green, and a very great proportion of the blue : and consequently the
colour of the pencil formed by reflection must necessarily be principally blue.

By using different kinds of glass and different oils I obtained various ana-
logous results, in which different rays of the spectrum were extinguished by
effecting (as far as possible) an equilibrium between the two opposite actions
