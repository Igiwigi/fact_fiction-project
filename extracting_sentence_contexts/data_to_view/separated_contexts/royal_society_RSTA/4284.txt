As a result of this discussion, it seems convenient to look for molecules with absorption
features in the spectral interval between 0.9 and 1.7m. In this respect, water is surely
advantageous because of the relatively small mass, which leads to large vibrational frequencies. As a matter of fact, the spectral lines of the 2v; and v; + v3 bands occur at 1.4,1m, with an
intensity as large as 10-Â° cm per molecule. Being a light molecule, it also shows a larger Doppler
width, when compared with CO) and other heavier molecules with absorption lines in the
NIR. Furthermore, the hyperfine structure can be neglected, as magnetic dipole and electric
quadrupole effects do not occur.
