The primary oocyte then has a diameter of
about 185,, and the nucleus a diameter of about 654. The nucleus remains very simple in
structure with dense masses of pale material containing two or three very dark spheres of
chromatin. The wall of the nucleus usually appears to be double due to the fact that it is
surrounded by a narrow but well-defined loose and very pale zone. The cytoplasm has a
narrow outer zone which, under high magnifications, appears to be less coarse in structure
than the larger central region. None of the dark cell inclusions which mark the primary
growth phase remain.
