E successive days has become very small, so that trifling accidental irregularities are
a prejudicial to accurate time deductions. This difficulty will naturally tend to
disappear as the number of years for which international data are available increases,
and the power of the method will thus continually develop.

In § 6, it will be remembered, we obtained a result which suggested that the length
of the period increased with the amplitude of the selected disturbance. If, however,
this were the case, one would expect the interval between successive subsequent
pulses associated with the selected disturbed days to gradually diminish, and the
intervals derived from pulses associated with quiet days to be shorter than those from
pulses associated with disturbed days. These tendencies are not apparent in fig. 2.

§ 10. The fact that the rise in the “ character” figure in the two days immediately

preceding the representative disturbed day exceeds the fall in the two immediately
following days has been already noticed. This peculiarity is a prominent feature in
all the associated pulses in fig. 2, except the third previous, where the exact day of
incidence of the maximum is not clearly indicated. In the case of the selected quiet
days, on the other hand, the fall in the “ character” figure in the two immediately
preceding days is less rapid than the rise in the two immediately succeeding days,
and the same peculiarity is reproduced in the first previous and the first and second
subsequent pulses. The second previous pulse shows the opposite phenomenon, but
