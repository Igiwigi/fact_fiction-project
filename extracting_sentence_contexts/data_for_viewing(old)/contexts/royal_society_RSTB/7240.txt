streak is simply excised from a blastoderm, the cut edges may heal together, a new primitive
streak be constituted, and normal development proceed. Waddington & Cohen (1936)
have found analogous behaviour in the pre-nodal region. If the reversed-piece fails to heal
essentially the same regeneration may take place dorsal to the reversed-piece, which is
therefore left isolated and inconspicuous ventral to a normal embryo. This has happened
in three specimens (which have been included in column 4 of table 1). It is, however,
hardly possible for such an isolated reversed-piece to disappear without trace, and in the

majority of cases of complete regulation the healing of the reversed-piece to the residual
blastoderm was actually observed during development; so there can in fact be little doubt
that the cases of complete regulation involve the incorporation of the reversed-piece into
the resulting embryo. Since the embryos have not been carried beyond a 10- to 15-somite
stage, normality refers only to structures developed at this stage. For this reason, the
attainment of complete regulation is often not of the same significance after operations of
types III and IV as after the other types, since such reversals may have involved tissues
still little differentiated at the time of fixation. It may be added that rate of development
of completely regulated embryos operated at S or M stages seemed often to be abnormally
slow.

By partial regulation is meant the development of an embryonic axis in the orientation of
the residual blastoderm, but showing minor traces of the operation. Such traces are how-
ever of a kind met with among the unreversed controls, and are not indicative of any
