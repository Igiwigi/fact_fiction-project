The degree of sensitiveness varies between wide limits. Discharges frequently
occur in which close obseryation is necessary to detect any trace of it, while others
may be produced s0 sensitive that the magnetic action of a powerful electro-magnet is
hardly more marked than the action which is due to it as a conductor. The condition
in question does not appear to be confined to any particular gaseous medinm or to any
special form of tube ; and it is in fact probable that in almost any tube sensitiveness
may be produced by adopting suitable precautions.* This state of sensitiveness may
be exhibited by stratified discharges, but it is more commonly as8ociated with those
which show no clear traces of stratification. Tt is not however universally present in
either kind of discharge.
