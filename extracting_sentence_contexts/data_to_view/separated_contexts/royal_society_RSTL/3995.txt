DR. MANTELL ON FOSSIL FORAMINIFERA. 469

ages that must have elapsed since the deposition of the chalk in which it was en-
shrined, is a fact not less remarkable than the occurrence of the carcase of the Lena
Mammoth, in the frozen soil of Siberia. | In another example (fig. 7), a series of sacs, held together by the connecting tube,
is uncoiled as it were, and extended in a longitudinal direction ; proving the flexible
nature of the original substance. On examining by reflected light, under the microscope, some pieces of chalk col-
lected from the stratum which yielded the fossils above-described, minute particles of
a brown colour may be obseryed scattered over the surface ; these I have no doubt
= are remains of the integuments of foraminifera ; for in one instance, three cells of the
'S S$hell of a Rotalia lined with a similar snbstance, were exposed.
