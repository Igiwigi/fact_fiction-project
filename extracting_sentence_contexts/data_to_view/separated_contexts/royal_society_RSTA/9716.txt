Neither could they have been caused by
fluctuations in the temperature, for those would have been detected by the bolometer. The observed variations therefore probably owe their origin, as we have already
suggested, to some slight relative movement of the agate knife-edges consequent upon
the loading of the beam. The correctness of this view may also be inferred from the
fact that when the above experiment is repeated with the balance duly fatigued, the
obtained R.P. curve is a right line wholly free from undulations. We may therefore conclude that the slight periodic variations which the bolometer
has shown to exist in the temperature within the usual balance case, are responsible
for the more or less harmonic motions recorded in the R.P. curve ; and it appears very
probable that these effects must always be detectable in a sensitive balance, the beam
of which is not guarded in some such manner as we have indicated. Of the Major Undulations to be Found in a Resting-Point Curve.
