observed under the microscope, and showed very few half-dissolved prisxms of gypsam,
but numerous very small octohedrons, which had been hidden by the gypsum. Besides
these octohedrons, some hemiprismatic crystals were found, precisely similar to those
which I formerly had obtained when forming a borate of magnesia. 'The powder con-
tained, further, some prisms which were striated parallel to the axis, and had a face per-
pendicular to this axis; they resembled precisely the crystals which I several years ago
described as artificial apatite, and which were obtained by fusing calcined bones with
chloride of sodium; and they were in fact apatite, formed of the phosphoric acid,
fluorine, chlorine, and lime of the sea-water. Of the powder in question, which essen-
tially consisted of octohedrons, I dissolved 7-184 grains in nitric acid, which left 0-160
grain of a reddish powder consisting mostly of oxide of iron, but showing also under
the microscope hemiprismatic crystals like the borate of magnesia. The nitric solution
gave with ammonia a precipitate which weighed 0-633, and contained phosphoric acid.
At last the remaining s0lution gave with phosphate of soda and an excess of ammonia
16-667 ignited phosphate of magnesia=6:-074 pure magnesia. The 8wn of all these
substances thus determined was 6-867, 80 that only a quantity amounting to 0-317 grain
which was wanting could be boracic acid.

It was thus clear that the octohedrons analyzed could not be boracite, and there could
hardly be any doubt but that the substance was essentially pure magnesia, mixed with
