winds [1]. He also attempted to map earthquake risk, which he claims is higher in areas with
plentiful hot springs, but lower for islands far from the coast [1]. In contrast, according to
the Japanese mythology, earthquakes are caused by the movement of a giant catfish named
Namazu, which can only be restrained by the god Kashima. The need for accurate earthquake
risk management strategy remains today and will be the topic of several papers in this theme
issue on fracture and earthquakes.

The prominent Renaissance figure, Leonardo da Vinci, further observed that the tensile
strengths of nominally identical metal wires tended to decrease with the length of the wire [2].
Similar observations were made by Galileo Galilei, also more than 400 years ago [3]. It was
understood much later that these results are, in fact, manifestations of the extreme statistics of
failure [4,5]. Due to microscopic fluctuations in material properties, the most extreme defect in a
larger sample volume will tend to be more serious than any defect in a smaller sample volume, :
on average. The weaker pointâ€™s ability to nucleate failure earlier implies a lower strength of the =
larger sample. The statistics of these extreme fluctuations are quite different in nature from those 3
of average behaviour, or even critical fluctuations. Again, the statistical treatment of such rare
events, and how much they can be anticipated (if not exactly predicted) will be a theme that we nee)
will return to repeatedly throughout this issue. :

More formal investigations on fracture propagation began with the energy balance criteria a]
proposed by Alan Griffith [6]. His seminal paper (which remains the second most cited paper in DNS
the long history of this journal) considered the energy balance required to activate an existing flaw aa)
or crack and forms one footing of modern linear elastic fracture mechanics. The other is George 8S
