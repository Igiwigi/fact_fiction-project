If ON be the abscissa of any such point, 4x = ON, and r= ws .@ gives the radius

Q of the corresponding interface between two shells. It is evident at once from the
~ construction that the thicknesses of the shells, as we pass in or out, are alternately
g greater and less—that there are two categories, in one of which the thickness
2 increases as we pass in, and an alternate series in which it decreases, There will be,
A however, some irregularity in the two inner components.

= The position of the equatorial axes is determined by those abscissee, for which the
S tangents to the J curve and the parabola are parallel. They are easily recognized by
= the eye, and thus a starting point for calculation is readily obtained. The difference
of ordinates of these points (P,P.) is proportional to the secondary circulations of
@ the corresponding shells. In fact, when multiplied by zy/(ScA — sin d), the products
8 give the values of those constants. It is therefore clear from the figure that these
& circulations are in opposite directions alternately, and that we get two alternate
8 series of ascending and descending values,

= The function S (A) =Sid — sin d denotes the area between the J curve and the
3 axis of « up to the point ». It is clear, therefore, that it has its maximum values at

= the odd , points, and its minimum at the even ones,

= The tracing of the current sheets is particularly easy from the fact that they are
& given by functions of the form
