of great importance, have shown poor translation from animals to humans lead-
ing industry to withdraw from, especially, treatment development for psychiatric
disorders [3]. In fact, the pharmaceutical industry has never had treatments for
addiction high on its list of priorities for development (with one or two notable
exceptions) despite the morbidity and mortality associated with the disorder
and its enormous personal, family, economic and societal impact [4].

However, translational studies of addiction stand on firm ground if in animals,
behavioural rather than subjective measures of drug use (e.g. craving, liking) are
used to enable contact—homology or analogy—to be made with clinical and
human experimental studies. Animals will self-administer drugs that are addictive
in humans, often showing patterns of drug taking and foraging that resemble pat-
terns of behaviour seen in humans. More than 50 years of advances in research on
drug self-administration have enabled a detailed understanding of the molecular
and cellular basis of the reinforcing effects of stimulants, opioids, alcohol and
