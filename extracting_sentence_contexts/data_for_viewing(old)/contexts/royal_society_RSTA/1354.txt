environments, or (c) there are a finite number of local environments and every atom sees one
of them, but this number is not fixed, ie. we can have bigger local environments if we allow more
of them. (The latter is a property of a Penrose tiling with atoms at the nodes.) Given that all real
structures are anyway bounded, these local properties seem to us to be quite promising as a basis
for the discovery of unusual materials.

We begin with the simplest example. Consider commutative generators 91,22 having the
form (2.5) introduced in §2 but not satisfying the conditions (2.10) of discreteness. The structure
(gighexa) : p,q € Z}, with x; not on the axis, generates points on a cylinder C of radius |z| with axis
e (figure 1a). If the discreteness conditions (2.10) fail, then there are accumulation points on C,
ie. G= {gigh : p,q € Z} is not discrete. However, as shown in figure 5a, by simply cutting off the
powers p,q, large regions of the cylinder become locally objective structures with various size
molecules. In fact, by carefully choosing the powers p,q one can arrange that there is a seam
on the cylinder parallel to the axis e, and each atom away from this seam sees the same local
environment, figure 5b. And, curiously, the atoms right next to the seam (on one side) also all see
the same environment. One can arrange also that the seam is helical, figure 6b.

A close examination of figure 5a reveals locally objective molecular structures with molecules
of different size. By selecting the powers p,q suitably, one can also make a uniform molecule.
Figure 6 shows a case with a diatomic molecule. Again, necessarily, there is a seam, which is
chosen to be helical in figure 6b.

The non-discrete groups here offer a lot of additional freedom on the structure of the molecule
and its placement with regard to its neighbours, at the expense of a seam. For example, a much
enlarged set of lattice parameters becomes possible that would not be possible with a helical
