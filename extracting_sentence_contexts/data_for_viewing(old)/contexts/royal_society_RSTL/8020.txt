principle to a ship, we see that the longitudinal pressure upon any part bounded by a
DSransversc section equals the pressure upon the immersed area of that transverse section,
nd acts through the centre of pressure of the immersed area. By this means, therefore.
owe can determine the amount and the line of action of the resultant longitudinal pressure
pon the parts of a ship, either towards the bow or towards the stern, cut off by a trans-
verse section; and knowing these two features, we can determine the moment of the
pressure about any horizontal line in the transverse section. For our present purpose
it will suffice to say that the line about which moments must be taken in order to
determine the bending effect produced by the pressure at the section coincides with the
ecntre of gravity of the section*®. As8wming that we know its position, and knowing

* It may be interesting to state here that Euizs's mistake respecting the action of this longitudinal pressure
arose from the fact that he considered the lower side of the keel as the © fulerum,”” as it was then termed, about
which moments should be taken.

the amount and the line of action of the resultant fluid pressure, the determination of
the bending-moment due to it is very simple.

I will now consider the cases of some actual ships, in order to give a more definite
idea of the amounts of the bending-moments due to the longitudinal pressure, and the
proportions they may bear to the bending-moments resulting from the action of vertical -
forces. Taking first the © Minotaur,” it has been found by calculation that the fluid -
