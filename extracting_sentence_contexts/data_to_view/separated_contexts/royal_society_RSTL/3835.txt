A very compact shining dark-coloured substance at
the detached basal margin of this fin may be the charred remains of its supporting
cartilage. The right fin, the free border of which is bent inwards upon the mantle,
as is not unusually seen in ordinary naked Cephalopods, has preserved its true posi-
tion, rising a little above the visceral chamber of the phragmocone. The most im-
portant additional fact which we derive from the present specimen is the continuation
of the mantle over the sheath of the phragmocone, proving indisputably the internal
position of that part. The chambered division and thin calcareous and nacreous
structure of the crashed remains of the phragmocone are quite identical with those
of the phragmocones preserved with the spathose guard in the specimens from Mr. Prarr's and Mr.
