Here, on the contrary, the older the seedling the less its
elongation. It may be mentioned here that there would seem to be a real distinction between
the development of nodes and the extension of internodes. To it is to be ascribed
the fact that the isophytic line for “ first flower ” does not run parallel in fig. 1 to the
isophytic line for “height, 30 cm.” It may be well to add that the reason is
probably of the nature of what we have called “ pre-determination,” to be further
discussed in Part III; the differentiation of the nodes in the bud is conditioned by
earlier environment than that which determines the fluctuation in internode length,
and the flowering branches can only arise at pre-formed nodes.
