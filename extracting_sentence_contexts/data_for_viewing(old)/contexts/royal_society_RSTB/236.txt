214 DR. C. H. BEEVOR AND PROFESSOR V. HORSLEY ON THE

different parts of the cortex now under consideration, The sequence or order j
which these movements occur forms the march for the part stimulated.

We shail take first the movements described above as an aid in dividing up
large area for the movements of the head and eyes, for the purpose of investigating
the “ March.” It will be remembered that we postponed for later consideration the
simultaneous movement of the head and eyes. The primary representation of thi
most important synergic action is given in Plate 40, fig. 5. It will be seen that i
representation has a very wide distribution, which for the most part corresponds in
mere extent with the representation of the movements of the head alone. Asa primary
movement, its importance entitles it to first consideration, for a review of the facts
given in Table L* will exhibit the very remarkable result that, of the 104 occasions
on which this movement was observed to occur, in 100 instances it was primary. This —
is, no doubt, a demonstration of the necessity that this primitive movement should
precede all others.

Taking first, then, the simultaneous movements of turning the head and eyes to
the opposite side, the following march can be made out for a considerable number of
centres. The order of this march is as follows :—

1. Simultaneous turning of the head and eyes to the opposite side.

2. Opening of the eyes wide.
