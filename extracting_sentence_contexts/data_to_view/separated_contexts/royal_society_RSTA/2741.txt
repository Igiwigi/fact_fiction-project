We further reject that computer system behaviours should be held to a ‘best-effort’ standard
because they are unforeseeable. The behaviours of any human artefact are considered during its

design and construction. Viewing computer system behaviours as though they are uncontrollable : =
ignores the fact that these systems are human artefacts, built to a purpose by some human : a
agency that must be accountable for the behaviours of those artefacts. Such a view defers too 73
strongly to the power dynamics at play, placing actions with human agency beyond governance, aes
control and accountability. Even when the specifics of how a system will interact with the world 22
are not directly foreseeable, they can be reviewed, managed and constrained.
