is important in managing short-term imbalances (frequency response) but does not have the
capacity to deliver ‘peak-load’ balancing, between night-time and daytime demand, which can
be provided by pumped-storage facilities, such as the Ffestiniog Power Station. Wind variability
poses new challenges as there can be periods of time lasting days when wind generation capacity
falls, so supplementary storage capacity needs to be on the scale of gigawatt-hours. To realistically
model the longer durations of over/under supply, Huntorf was chosen because it has limited
capacity that would be fully charged/discharged in a single operation. If Ffestiniog had been
modelled, with a capacity of around 360 MW over 5.5h, it might only be partially emptied/filled
ina single operation.

The efficiency of Huntorf is around 42%. This efficiency is too low to deliver an expected profit
and so an efficiency of 1 = 0.9 was chosen such that E(x) = nF(x). We construct F by combining the
discount rate, the actual load data with the MOC and the fact that Huntorf’s capacity is 290 MW
and fully charges /discharges over 2 h. The results, and MOC, are shown in figure 1 with

F(x) =5.1926 x 107 x? — 1.7997 x 10-79x° + 2.7287 x 10774x7

Functions ¢ and were estimated, as ¢ and w, by applying the load data and discount rate
to (2.2) and (2.3). By observing a scatter plot of the preliminary results shown in figure 2, it was
decided to fit the data to functions
