'B. Results obtained.

'Z In all, thirty-five distinet samples were tested, of twenty compositions. The first
= three were supplied to me by Messrs. MATHER and PLATT, and of these I have no
 analyses. All the res6 were analysed for me in the laboratory of Sir Joseen
E Wurrworrn and Co., and the samples of material were actually prepared there,

E telegraph wire, No. IV., from the North- Eastern Stee] Company ; and two Tungsten
S steels, Nos. XXX. and XXXI., which are in general use for permanent magnets,
V T would express here my great indebtedness to Mr. GLEDHILL, one of the managing
= directors of Sir J. Warrworta and Co., for preparing for me the samples I dexired,

A poseess really lies in the variety of samples tried and in the accompanying chemical
analysis, both due to Mr. GLEDHILL. Samples Nos. I.-X. and XXXII.-XXXV. were
| tested with a pair of bars, the rest with a single bar of the sample used, in com-
| bination with a bar of wrought iron. The particulars of the several samples are
most conveniently given in a table which follows, and to which I shall presently refer.
With many samples observations were made sufficient to plot the ascending and
descending curves which express induction in terms of magnetising force, but as these
can make no pretence, for reasons already stated, to such accuracy as would warrant
their use in testing a theory as to the form of curves of magnetisation, a few only are
' given as examples, and in other cases results are given in the table sufficient to define
