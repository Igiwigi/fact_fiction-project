He noticed
the cast-off provisional bristles, and some fragments of tissue which were probably
bits of the prototroch. His incorrect theory of the metamorphosis is really no more
remarkable than the actual truth. He had, however, been forestalled in his observation
of the metamorphosis by Kovatewsky, who in 1867 had established the fact that
Mitraria changes into a Polychete, but had unfortunately only communicated his
results verbally to Mrrscuntkorr. The latter refers to them in his paper published in
1871, a paper that has remained the most important account of the development of
Mitraria up to the present time. He described and figured two species obtained at
Spezia in May and June: both had needle-shaped bristles, and the first he considered
to be identical with Mitierâ€™s Trieste larva.
