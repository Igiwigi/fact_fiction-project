It precipitated gelatine, and gave a dark
EZ colour with the oxygenated sulphate of iron:

Z The solid matter remaining on the filtre, slightly reddened
2 vegetable blues; and, when dissolved in warm water, copiously
z precipitated the solutions of isinglass. M. ProvsT,* who first

paid attention to its properties, supposes that it is a compound
of the acid with tannin: but I suspect that it also contains
gallic acid, and probably a small portion of extractive matter.

* The fact of the precipitation of solution of galls by acids, was noticed by M. D1ze', See Annales de Chimie, Tome XXXV. p. 37,



on the constituent Parts of astringent Vegetables. 941

"This last substance, as is well known, is thrown down from its
solutions by sulphuric acid; and I found, in distilling the pre-
cipitate from galls by sulphuric acid, at a heat above 212", that
a fluid came over, of a light yellow colour, which was ren-
dered black by oxygenated sulphate of iron; but which was not
altered by gelatine. Muriatic acid produced, in the infusion, effects analogous to
those produced by sulphuric acid ; and two compounds of the
acid and the vegetable substances were formed : the one united
to excess of acid, which remained in solution ; the other con-
taining a considerable quantity of tannin, which was precipi-
tated in the solid form.
