2. First period, 1917-1960

In the first period of developments of mathematical cosmology, there appeared a great number
of novel fundamental ideas that still play a major role today in shaping the field of theoretical

cosmology: : =
:3
— The ‘universes’ as solutions of the field equations 1B
— The cosmological constant and vacuum energy : =
— Homogeneity of the universe :8
— Inhomogeneous and anisotropic cosmologies [3
— Expansion and contraction :8
— Evolution vs. steady state :8
— Big bang vs. bouncing models :g
— Gravitational stability and perturbations 78
— Hot big bang

— Causality and time travel
— Local vs. global structure

All these ideas are as fundamental and important in theoretical cosmology research today as
they were in the beginnings of modern cosmology. It is an amazing fact that the subsequent
development of the field in the coming decades proved that all these novel and important ideas
are still playing a major role, but at the same time are a small part of the complex network of
methods and directions that constitute mathematical cosmology today.

(a) Einstein static universe

On 8 February 1917, Einstein announced the first application of general relativity to the universe
considered as a whole, the Einstein static universe! [8]. It was a cosmological model of motionless
matter, having positively curved spatial sections (so had a finite volume but no boundary) and
an added repulsive force (dependent on the cosmological constant) balancing the attractive
gravitational force, resulting in a static world. But perhaps the most distinctive new feature of
Einstein’s static universe was its assumed overall homogeneity.
