SE D*U=(Xd,+Yd, +Zd.)*U,

Sand let II=@aX+4&Y +cZ=0 be the equation of a line. It is easy to see that
[- D*U—II.DU=0

will be the equation of a conic having an ordinary (two-pointic) contact with the curve
at the point (z, y, 2). In fact the equation DU=0 is that of the tangent at the point in
question, and the equation D*U =0 is that of the penultimate polar (or polar conic) of the
point, which conic is touched by the tangent ; the asswmed equation represents therefore
a conic having an ordinary (two-pointic) contact with the polar conic, and therefore with
the curve. It may be added that the two conics intersect besides in a pair of points, and
that the line Joining these, or common chord of the two conics, is the line represented
by the equation II=0; and this being s0, the constants («, 6, c) of the line IT=0 can
be 8 determined as to give rise to a five-pointic contact.
