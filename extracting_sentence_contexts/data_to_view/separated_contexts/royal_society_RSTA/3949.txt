The fact that half our series grew in one field, the other half in another,
that part came from one side of a road, part from another, may introduce an unper-
ceived heterogeneity which increases the apparent homotyposis. Thirdly, the
difficulty of ensuring that all individuals are of the same age or in the same stage
of development, is very great. The leaves of an old tree may have a fictitious
likeness when compared with those of a young tree ; we may gather organs from one
individual when it is in a stage of development, which would only be reached in
another individual some days or weeks later. These and other factors may perhaps
be to some extent eliminated—far better of course by the trained botanist than by

the mere mathematician—but I very much doubt the possibility of their complete
elimination.
