'Thus even when a very large P.D. is applied the observed curves show that the
electric intensity between the plates is very small, almost zero in some cases, so that
there is no reason to suppose that there is no recombination occurring between the
electrodes when this form of curve is obtained ; in fact, a saturating P.D. has not really
been applied, so that Marx’s argument breaks down. The presence of surface ioniza-
tion has much the same effect as an increase in the distance between the electrodes,
and consequently protects the intervening region from the applied P.D., so that it
does not get saturated. When the current is reversed so that the upper electrode is negative the supply of
negative ions is greatly diminished owing to the comparatively low temperature
of the upper electrode.
