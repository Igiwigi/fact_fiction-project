We know from the important researches of M. Ancor, referred to in the
“Preliminary Note,” that the connection between magnetic variations and sun-spot
frequency is unmistakable at Batavia as in Europe.

§ 64. In considering results such as those in Table XLVI, allowance must be made

for the fact that in the case of such an element as rainfall the results from any

single station for a single year, or even occasionally for a group of three years, may
not be fairly representative for more than a very limited area of country. But most
of the other elements are much more representative in character, and it seems
safe to conclude that, as between the two groups ot years of sun-spot maximum and
minimum, there was not in the south of England generally any difference of
meteorological character at all of the same order as that manifested in the magnetic
elements. From this generalization I would however exclude atmospheric electric
peotential.
a There seem, unfortunately, no data whence one can derive trustworthy information
Bis to changes from year to year in the mean potential gradient in the open. An
gittempt is at present being made at Kew to fill this gap, but with what success
