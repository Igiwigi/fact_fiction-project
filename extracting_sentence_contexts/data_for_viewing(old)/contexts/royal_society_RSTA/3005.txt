has a different vertical length but the same scale. (Online version in colour.)

these two solutions belong to different branches. This can be seen from the bifurcation curve
in figure 8. There is an inflection point on the curve located between the two cases at 6 ~ 0.51.
It separates oscillating DSESs from symmetric ones with zero velocity. The period of oscillating
solutions is twice the period of the curve Q(z) seen in figure 9. Similar inflection points can be
seen on other bifurcation diagrams.

The most striking feature of the diagram in figure 8 is the multiplicity of bifurcations that
takes place in a relatively narrow range of parameter change. This fact confirms that the CGLE
has a myriad of different types of solutions. There are periodic and chaotic solutions in this
region. The chaotic region can be entered through a sequence of period-doubling bifurcations.
This sequence can be seen in the region 0.216 < 6 < 0.231. Other routes to chaos also exist at
around f = 0.201.


5. Conclusion

The appearance of extreme spikes on top of wider dissipative solitons is a striking phenomenon
that deserves further theoretical and experimental investigation. Extreme spikes can appear
regularly [18] or chaotically [19]. In the latter case, they can be considered as rogue waves [20].
Extreme spikes can appear for a wide range of the system parameters. This range of parameters
