Etruscan shrew active touch

500 wm on average [16,70]. As in other mammals, the identified two topographically organized somatosen-
cortex of the Etruscan shrew is a cytoarchitectonically sory areas with small receptive fields referred to as
heterogeneous sheet of tissue. The presence of distinct putative primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and puta-
cortical areas is suggested by the fact that different tive secondary somatosensory cortex (S2). A third
staining methods (Nissl, cytochrome oxidase activity, tactile region was located posterior-laterally, where
myelin) indicate the same areal borders. Sensory neo- we observed large somatosensory receptive fields and
cortical areas could be clearly identified by often polysensory responses.
