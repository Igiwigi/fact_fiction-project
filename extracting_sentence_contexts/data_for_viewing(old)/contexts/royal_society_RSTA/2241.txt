the homology basis {az, Bx}.

Using y the periods of «dG® can be exhibited more clearly as

f *dG® =| dua, (8.3)
OK Y

and
} *dG® = | dUug,- (8.4)
Br y

Relations (8.3) and (8.4) generalize the corresponding vortex pair equations (3.14) and (3.15), in
fact they can be obtained by taking linear combinations of relations of the latter form.

The differentials dUy, and dUg, are fixed (independent of z1,...,Zn), so all dependence on
vortex locations now lies in the 1-chain y:

¥ =Y(1,-+-/2n)-

Further on, we may use (8.2) to express (8.3) and (8.4) in terms of the integrals dUg,, dUg, as in
(3.10) and (3.11):
