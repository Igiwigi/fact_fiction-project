At a very early stage in this investigation the question naturally presented itself :
Would jets of water and other liquids exhibit the same properties as gaseous jets ?
Referring to the historical notice at the beginning of this paper, it will be seen that
much more had been done in the way of reliable experiment with liquid than with
gaseous jets ; probably because the phenomena of 8uch jets appeal to two senses, sight
and hearing, and are therefore more easily studied. A few simple experiments sufficed
to 8how that all the results obtained with gaseous jets may also be obtained with liquid
jets, and in a more marked and satisfactory way.

As even the lightest known liquid has a very high density compared with air, we
should naturally not expect liquid jets to exhibit the same sensitiveness to gound that
gaseous jets do. Nor do they in fact ; while to purely mechanical disturbances they

are as sensitive, if not more 80. To produce powerful effects by sound on liquid
jets, it is therefore necessary to supply a lever, by means of which atrial sound-waves
may act on the orifice at greater mechanical adyantage. Such a leyer is afforded by
rigidly attaching the jet-tube to a sound-board which offers a large surface to the air.
In many cases, indeed, the support or table on which the jet apparatus rests will
answer all purposes ; but, generally it is better to attach the jet tube to a pine-board,
about a quarter of an inch thick, and having a surface of about one square foot. A
board of this thickness is preferable to a thinner one, since ib is nob 80 apt to play the
