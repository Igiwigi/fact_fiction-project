the supernatant atmosphere. Now it is not certain whether an amount of heat which
would be absolutely destructive to a germ embraced by a hot liquid may not be wholly
ineffectual when acting on a germ floating in vapour or air. Throughout SPALLANZANI'S
and NEEpnav's experiments, throughout those of WyMAN and RoBgR1s, and throughout
my own, as reported in this section and the last, this possibility of error runs. Such
experiments, in short, do not enable us to state with certainty the temperature at which
an infusion is sterilized, because the germs which most pertinaciously oppose sterilization
may not belong to the infusion at all, but to the adjacent air.

. The most astonishing cases of resistance to sterilization observed by
Wraax were associated with this particular mode of experiment. The
possible action of the uncleansed air, moreover, was in his case augmented
by the fact that he employed quantities of liquid, very small in comparison
with the size of his flascks, In some of his earlier experiments the yohume
of air was more than thirty times that of the infusion. These relative
volumes -are represented in the annexed figure (fig. 7), copied from
