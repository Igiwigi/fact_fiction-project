Adult Talk circumstance can be attributed, we think, to
infant protest at being left in a crib or stroller with little or
no adult attentionâ€”mothers did not allow the crying to go
on too long, choosing to hold the infant while reading if
the infant persisted in crying. Figure 2a shows that at the
latest ages, laughter proved to be about as frequent as cry/
whimper in the Parent Infant Talk circumstance.

We also considered rates of laughter occurring in the
all-day recordings as a function of the amount of IDS and
whether the infant was alone during the 5 min segments as
indicated by the questionnaire items. Results for the second
half-year support the long-recognized fact that laughter is a
social phenomenon, with 6.6 times more laughter occurring
with IDS than without IDS, and 8.8 times more laughter
when infants were not alone than otherwise. At the
same time, also in the second half-year, even in segments
when someone was talking to an infant, the rate of laugh-
ter (0.098 per minute) was very small compared with
protophone rates (4.8 per minute).
