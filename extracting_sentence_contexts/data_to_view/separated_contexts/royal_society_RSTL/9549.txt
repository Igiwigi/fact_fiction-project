This complete inability of a stimulus to
escape round the ends of an injury, forms a marked contrast to the almost unlimited
degree in which snch escape takes place in the more primitive nervous plexus of the
Meduswe. Although the nervous connexions on which the spines and pedicellarie depend for
their function of localising and closing round a seat of stimulation are thus shown to
be completely destroyed by injury of the external plexus, other nervous connexions,
upon which another function of the spines depends, are not in the 8mallest degree
impaired by such injury. The other function to which we allude is that which brings
about the general co-ordinated action of all the spines for the purposes of locomotion,
That this function is not impaired by injury of the external plexus is proved by the
fact that, if the area within a closed line of injury on the 8urface of the shell be
strongly irritated, all the spines over the whole surface begin to manifest their peculiar
bristling movements, and by this co-ordinated action rapidly move the animal in a
straight line of escape from the source of irritation ; the injury to the external plexus,
although completely separating the spines enclosed by ib from their neighbouring
spines as regards what may be called their local function of seizing the instrument of
stimulation, nevertheless leaves them in undisturbed connexion with all the other
spines in the organisxm as regards what may be called their universal function of
locomotion.

(B.) Evidently, therefore, this more universal function must depend upon some
other set of nervous connexions ; and experiment, shows that these are distributed
over all the internal surface of the shell. Our mode of experimenting was to divide
the animal into two hemispheres, remove all the internal organs of both hemispheres
(these operations producing no impairment of any of the functions of the pedicels,
spines, or pedicellarize), and then paint with strong acid the inside of the shell—com-
pletely washing out the acid after about a quarter of a minute's exposure. The results
of a number of experiments conducted on this method may be thus epitomised :—

The effect of painting the back or inside of the hell with strong acid (e.g., pure
HCI) is that of ab first strongly stimulating the spines into bristling movements,
and 800n afterwards reducing them to a state of quiescence, in which they lie more or
less flat, and in a peculiarly confused manner, that closely resembles the appearance of
corn when © laid” by the wind.
