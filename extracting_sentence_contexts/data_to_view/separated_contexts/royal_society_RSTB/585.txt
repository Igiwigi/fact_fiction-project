Further, it will be remembered that the sections
(figs. 41-45) which we are now examining, are not frontal but fronto-oblique. Con-
sequently, a section made at this level would pass inferiorly through the occipital
lobe-—this is shown by the fact that we have now reached the point where the
ealcarine fissure appears in sagittal sections to pass backwards from the dentate
sulcus——and would therefore cut through the cingulum somewhere in the upper part
of the gyrus hippocampi, or in the isthmus of the gyrus fornicatus (fig. 10, near S./.). We have here, therefore, the calcarine fissure becoming more marked as we proceed
backwards, whilst the dentate sulcus diminishes and finally disappears.
