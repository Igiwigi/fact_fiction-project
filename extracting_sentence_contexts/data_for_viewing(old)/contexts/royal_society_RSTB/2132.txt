is to me very difficult to understand : if the leaf as a whole lost water, why were the
guard cells exempt? Especially if, as Sra believes, the guard cells transpire to an
especial degree. The only possible explanation seems to be that the guard cells
robbed the rest of the leaf of water and thus retained their turgescence. But if so,
the guard cells are practically less sensitive than the rest of the leaf, since they fail
close when the leaf is actually suffering.
ie The “ preliminary opening,” which has been described in § 3, seems to show
“phat the guard cells are not the first to wither ; it may also mean that they rob the
Best of the leaf of water, as above suggested. But the fact that they soon wither
dnd close shows that this source of water can only help the guard cells in cases
Shere the general transpiration is slight, as in very moist air. If the guard cells had
Bis power to any great extent, it would, as above pointed out, be a bad arrange-
Hent, and the facts given in § 7, showing that the stomata close before the leaf
Sithers perceptibly, prove that the slowness in reaction of the guard cells, if it
“Exists at all, has under ordinary conditions no marked effect.
"8 The outcome of the above discussion of this difficuit subject is, that we have no
vidence of a specialised sensitiveness in the guard cells. The only alternative
“Beems to be that they close or open according as the leaf as a whole is badly or well
Supplied with water, either owing to variation in the psychometric conditions or in
She water-supply. ’
> But there are great difficulties in this view. In the dry air of a room the stomata
lose rapidly, without the leaf becoming perceptibly flaccid; that is to say, the
guard cells are more flaccid than the rest of the leaf. And this is a direct contradic-
Sion of the view to which we seemed to be driven—that the guard cells share in the
eneral turgor of the leaf.
