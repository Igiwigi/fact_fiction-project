RATIO OF IMPERIAL STANDARD YARD. TO INTERNATIONAL PROTOTYPE METRE. 305

These equations express the fact that the provisional value nx for the point » in this
calibration has theoretically been brought into coincidence with the unknown ideal
value , by the vertical movement Ax and the tilt By of the whole of the graph to which
the value ny belongs. In these equations as applied to one calibration only there are py +2 unknowns,
namely 09, 1), 29---%-++(px Of these) and the two quantities A, and By.
