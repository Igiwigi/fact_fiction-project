Then using the interaction machine notion, when a lifted input symbol a
corresponding to a â‚¬ A acts on the machine, all present components are updated according to the
usual cascade formulation, but those constituents where a value should fall that have not been
set before come into existence at that moment with the appropriate state value. This continues as
each input symbol acts, resulting in a growing cascade. a

Remarks on recurrence. Transience of the natural subsystems (X,(X)per) of A is a natural
consequence of the fact that semigroups allow for irreversible change. However, with the notion
of an interaction machine as formulated here and an ensemble approach in which new instances of
A may continually arise, this transience itself becomes a recurring phenomenon, as do instances
of the natural subsystems given by its permutation groups (X,(X)per). Semigroups such as the
natural numbers N or real numbers R are taken in physics as models of time.
