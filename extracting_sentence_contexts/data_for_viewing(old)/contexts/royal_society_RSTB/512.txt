nitrification, there were grown very large crops of red clover containing very large
amounts of nitrogen. Ona plot where a purely mineral manure, containing potash,
had been applied for 27 years up to 1878, but no manure whatever since, 347 lbs. of
nitrogen were gathered, almost wholly by the clover. On a plot, on half of which
the mineral manure dnly, and on the other half the same mineral manure with some
ammonium salts or nitrate had been applied up to 1878, but nothing since, 330 lbs. of
nitrogen were removed in the crops. Lastly, where on half the plot there had been
no manure whatever for nearly 40 years, and on the other half ammonium salts or
nitrate to 1878, but nothing since, 281 lbs. of nitrogen were yielded in the crops.

It may be said, therefore, that about 300 lbs. of nitrogen had been gathered by the
clover growing on a soil upon which beans had yielded smaller and smaller crops, and, in
fact, had eventually practically failed, and which was very poor both in total nitrogen near
the surface, very poor in ready formed nitric acid to a considerable depth, and very poor
in nitrogenous crop-residue for nitrification, If therefore the clover had taken up its
nitrogen either wholly or mainly as nitric acid, the supply could not be due to recent
crop-residue.

Not only was so much nitrogen removed in the crops, but the surface soil became
determinably richer in nitrogen, as the following results will show. The plots are the
same as those to which Table VII. refers; and the determinations are those made in
samples of surface soil collected in April, 1883, before the sowing of the barley and
clover, and in November, 1885, after the removal of the crops.
