The
mechanical effect of severance must be to diminish turgor, but diminished turgor
of the guard cells can only lead to closure; therefore the result must depend on
diminished pressure in the rest of the leaf. Exactly analogous evidence is given by
the effect of wetting leaves or surface sections of leaves. Many of these experi-
ments date from Monwâ€™s time; Lrrrces has also shown that, for instance, the
stomata of Potamogeton natans can be closed by wetting,* or even by damp air.

this treatment must undoubtedly increase the turgor both of epidermis and guard
ells ; if, therefore, wetting a leaf closes the stomata, the fact proves clearly that
Bihe epidermic pressure may conquer the guard cells. It is precisely the converse of
2the numerous experiments given above, in which cutting a leaf from the plant causes
gm temporary opening of the stoma. It is true that in these cases we seem to have
Biirect victory of the epidermis over the guard cells, but this need not make us
Sdoubt the existence of correlated interaction in the everyday life of the leaf.
