force.

1834. Gold, silver, potassium, and copper were introduced at x with the like ne-
gative effect ; and 80 no doubt might every other metal, even according to the rela-
tion admitted amongst the metals by the supporters of the contact theory (1809.).
The same negative result followed upon the introduction of many other conducting
bodies at the same place; as, for instance, those already mentioned as easily con-
ducting the thermo current (1820.) ; and the effect proves, I think, that the contact
of any of these with either iron or platinum js utterly ineffective as a source of elec-
tromotive force.

1835. The only answer which, as it appears to me, the contact theory can set up
in opposition to the foregoing facts and conclusions is, to say that the solution of
sulphuret of potassium in the cup D, fig. 2, acts as a metal would do (1809.), and
80 the effects of all the contacts in the circuit are exactly balanced. I will not stop
at this moment to show that the departure with respect to electrolytes, or the fluid
bodies in the voltaic pile, from the law which is supposed to hold good with the
metals and solid conductors, though only an assumption, is still essential to the con-
tact theory of the voltaic pile (1810. 1861.)*; nor to prove that the electrolyte is no
otherwise like the metals than in having no contact electromotive force whatever.
But believing that this will be very evident shortly, I will go on with the experi-
mental results, and resume these points hereafter (1859. 1889.).

1836. The experiment was now repeated with the substitution of a bar of nickel
for that of iron, fig. 2 (1824.), all other things remaining the same4. The circuit
