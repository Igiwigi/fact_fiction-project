f the isolated parts, together with external protective tissues, as sporangia,
sre were also formed, probably simultaneously, appendicular organs (sporangio-
d sporophylls), which bear them. That in certain cases (Psilotaceze and
lg Equisetineze) the original sporangia underwent a further subdivision, by
‘ign of sterile septa, the result being synangia of various types. Tsoetes, and
K% Lepidodendron, are to be taken as examples of such sterilization resulting in
ji in place of complete septa. The sterilization thus involved would be
an kind to that which was so ably traced by Lerrers in the Liverworts. A
& special interest in connection with this is the presence of sterile cells in the
rBporangia of Hquisetwm and the Psilotacer, scattered through the sporogenous
a similar cells have been observed by Rosrowzew (‘Recherches sur l’Ophio-
> vulgatum, L.,’ Kjébenhavn, 1891, p. 28, Plate 2, fig. 5) in the Adder’s-
and I have been able to confirm the fact. It thus appears that in Hquisetum,
mn, Tmesipteris, and Ophioglosswm, all types in which the sporangia are closely
d together so as to form synangia, a considerable proportion of the potential
ous tissue is sterile, the cells yielding up their substance to nourish their
which develop as mature spores. This cannot be looked upon as a mere
ce; it demands careful consideration, both from the physiological and

ogical aspects.
the physiological point of view the sterile cells act the part of a diffused
tum; they become disorganized, and the substances which compose them are
nm up into the developing spores. Developmentally they are sister cells with
which produce spores,—they are, in fact, potentially sporogenous cells, and the
on may be asked, why they do not develop as such. It would appear that
