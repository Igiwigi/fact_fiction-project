as individuals who eat more or less, drink more than a certain
number of units of alcohol per week, take more or less phys-
ical exercise or are more or less impatient. Our reason for
choosing smoking as an example is that it is one of the
most highly studied behaviour patterns in the context of
human telomere length: many epidemiological studies
include smoking status as a control variable, even if it is
not the major focus of the study.

From the perspective of behavioural ecology, smoking
might seem like an odd choice: it is an exclusively human
behaviour for which it is difficult to provide an adaptive expla-
nation. However, we argue that the fact that some people are
more likely to start smoking than others, and also find it
harder to quit, suggests that there is variation in anatomy or
physiology between future smokers and non-smokers, for
example, in the brain circuits responsible for emotional regu-
lation, that is likely to have broader significance for other
types of behaviour. Thus, although the behaviour pattern
that we are studying is a comparatively recent human cultural
innovation, we argue that it reflects differences in fundamental
mechanisms of behaviour that are likely to be evolutionarily
ancient and of broad significance in explaining behavioural
variation in humans and animals.
