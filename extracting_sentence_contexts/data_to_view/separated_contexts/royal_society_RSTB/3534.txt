Microcycas, on the other hand, which is quite xerophytic
in its organisation, though having an actual space between its veins only one-
third of that between the veins of Bowenia, yet has the longest and most differentiated
transfusion cells of any we measured. It is possible, therefore, that the absence of
transfusion tissue in the fossils may be considered a specific character, as in the case of
Bowenia ; but as they are so much more like the xerophytic Microcycas in their
organisation, it seems very probable that it depended on the closeness of the veins,
which made the system of conducting tissue more efficient. It remains a fact that
the closeness of the veins in Cycadeoidea and Niponophyllum (to a less extent),
makes it a physical impossibility for such elongated cells as the true Cycadean
transfusion tissue to be present between the bundl√©s, while the closeness of the veins
may remove the physiological necessity for them. In conclusion, Zamiophyllum seems to lie somewhere between Cordaites and

* The veining of Monocotyledons is more comparable, as it is parallel, and in them there is a fine
cross network of veins between the main ones, which makes the conducting system efficient.
