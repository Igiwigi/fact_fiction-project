It is possible to characterize the first-order phase transitions in terms of two dimensionless : =
parameters, the strength of the phase transition, a, and the inverse duration of the phase : =
transition, 8, in addition to the reheating temperature T,. Figure 7 shows the reaches of AION, :8
AEDGE, LISA and ET for the three representative values 6/H = 10, 10? and 10Â° assuming the [3
signal is dominantly produced by sound waves [55,57-59]. It is, however, important to remember : Ss
that due to the fact that the sound wave period only lasts a small fraction of the Hubble time [60- :8
62] the dependence on key parameters is the same as it would be for supercooled transitions in : =
which bubble collisions would be the dominant signal [63-65] and as a result the appropriate 1s

plot for that source would be very similar. Temperature of the transition effectively controls the
frequency of the signal through redshift. Thus as expected AION-km has very good sensitivity
for temperatures between LISA and ET provided a 2 O(0.1) provided B/H < 10?.
