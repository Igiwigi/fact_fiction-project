function representing forces at the centres of the circles which leave the straight edges
free from stress. This is expanded in a series about one centre. The coefficients in these
series contain 7, the modified value of Poisson’s ratio used in generalized plane stress
(Filon 1903, p. 67; Love 1927, p. 138). These functions are biharmonic functions for all
values of 7, and this may be treated as an arbitrary constant provided the functions
obtained from the fundamental one are of the type giving single-valued displacements
(Knight 1934, p. 256). Having given o a particular value we obtain by successive
differentiation functions of type (1-6).

In the most general problem four sets of functions will be required, two sets u, and
two v,. These may be found from two fundamental functions by giving ¢ two special,
suitable values. The method of solution is the same as before, for the infinite plate; but it
is, in general, complicated by the fact that four sets of unknown coefficients will have to
be evaluated by the successive approximations.

2. Two EQUAL CIRCLES IN AN INFINITE PLANE

Let the co-ordinate systems associated with the circles as shown in fig. 1 be defined by

=a, 2 a 1! (2-1)

We then have invariance for reflexion in a line parallel to the y axis midway between
