One striking case is that of the putative Altaic family, consisting mini-
mally of three Glottolog families, Turkic, Mongolian and Tungusic,
containing a total of 73 languages, thereby rendering it a large language
family; holding constant the remainder of the Glottolog classification, it
would rank 14th in size worldwide. In the TAM survey, there are 19
Altaic languages, of which 18, or 94.7%, have obligatory TAM marking,
which is perhaps suggestive of a large-family effect.

'6One might wonder why the relevant unit, that in which the corre-
lation between language-family size and obligatory TAM marking is
at its most pronounced, is in some cases a Glottolog family but in
other cases, a smaller group within a Glottolog family. In fact,
there is no principled reason why; it is a mere matter of historical
accident. As noted in §2, the actual factor claimed to be driving the
increase of obligatory TAM marking is rapid demographic expansion
and associated rise in socio-political complexity; such events
obviously occurred, in different parts of the world, at different
times and are therefore reflected in contemporary genealogical
groupings of varying time depths.

'” As observed in Gil & Shen [29], one of the other factors affecting the
degree of grammaticalization of thematic-role assignment is polity
complexity; as mentioned in §1, this provides further support for
the Complexity Covariance Hypothesis. In particular, in accordance
