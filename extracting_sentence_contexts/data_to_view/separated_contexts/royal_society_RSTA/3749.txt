Figure 2 also shows a line of slope
1/2 (dashed) for comparison. Evidently, (Lt) follows a different scaling. In fact, it will be made
clear later (in figure 3) that the probability density function (PDF) of the uv signal is far from being
Gaussian, ruling out the expectation of a (y+)'/? scaling. Furthermore, we observe that the signal
spends a large portion of its time at values close to zero. This is likely to cause some uncertainty in
determining (Lt); however, the signals were obtained from two different experimental facilities
and both show highly similar behaviour.
