{aE difficulties attendant upon the accurate microscopical investigation of enamel

fd dentine, especially of the latter tissue, have been so great, that very varied views
to their structure and development have been held up to the present time.

2 In the study of the development of dentine, where it is necessary to retain a very
e and delicate tissue, the pulp, in its natural relations to a hard, calcified tissue,
thie dentine, the difficulties have been greatest, and it has generally been found
Icessary to resort to decalcification of the hard tissue by acids, to ensure this
tention of the natural relations of the parts.

£ Even, however, by this method, aided by the improved processes of section cutting
@w in use, good preparations, in which the cells of the pulp are retained in
Fadisturbed contact with the dentine through any great extent of surface, are
Brnparatively yare, and the cells of the pulp usually exhibit by their shrunken
<ondition the injurious effects of the reagents used.

3 It is probable also that there are other detrimental effects of these reagents present,
ae are not so easily detected, and the fact of the lime salts being -removed from

e dentine, does, as I shall endeavour to show, produce an alteration in its
microscopical appearances. By a process elaborated by Dr. L.
