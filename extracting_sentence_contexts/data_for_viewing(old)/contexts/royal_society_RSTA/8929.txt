associated the first movements to East and to South together.

In ease (1) the second movement of 8, which follows the first movement imme-
diately, is South = 3'5 mm., West = 8'4 mm., Vertical =3°0 mm. This gives

9°0 mm. along « and 1°4 mm. at right angles to a and H/V = 3, the same as in the
first movement. The angle of impingence deduced is 57° or 73°, the ambiguity
arising from the fact that in this region of reflexion H/V has the same value for two
different angles. We cannot settle the ambiguity except by observations for different
distances, and the fact that case (2) gives e close to 60° (the minimum value of H/V
being about 2 at this point), suggests that the larger angle 73° is probably the right
one. The value from the time curve is 65°, and the discrepancy is of importance.
I consider the test by direct observation of the angle a very searching one, and likely
to throw considerable light on the question of the accuracy of the time curves.

Passing to the reflexion of transversal waves SR,, we have to observe that when
the vibration is perpendicular to the azimuth plane no change is introduced by
reflexion, so that such waves proceed as before. The vibration in the azimuth plane
undergoes change in type for A less than 4000 km., and at greater distances change
of magnitude and change of sign. This introduces very profound changes in the
character of the effects to be expected. :
