The question now was, what further conclusions could be drawn from the wealth of
material obtained from the ‘‘ Margrethe’s” seventy-three stations, comprising, as it
did, apart from larve of the fresh-water eel, close on 10,000 larvee of other eel-fishes.

In October and November, and the early part of December, 1913, the “ Margrethe ”
was working in the western part of the Atlantic, between Newfoundland and the
West Indies, in the course of which cruise the northern and southern limits of
distribution of the larvee of the European eel were determined. They were found to
occur from about 40° N. lat. (a bare 200 miles south of the Newfoundland Banks), to
about 24° N. lat. ‘To the westward, specimens were found as far as our investigations
reached, viz., to Bermuda and the sea to the south of there, 7.e., to about 65° W.
long., and even here they were present in great numbers. This was an astonishing’
fact, for one would hardly have expected to find the larvee of our European eel as a
numerous population in Atlantic waters so far west as 65°—New York lies about 74°!
Larvee of the American eel were also taken in our nets, but in remarkably small
numbers, amounting to only some few (3-4) per cent. of the total number of Anguilla
larvee. Here, again, a new problem arose ; for how could it be that Bermuda was, as
it were, surrounded by a belt of larvee of the European eel, when all the specimens of
fresh-water eels I had previously examined from these islands had proved to belong
to the American Anguilla rostrata? It was not until several years after that we
were to learn the explanation of the mystery; the time was not yet ripe for its
solution.

We now come to the size of the eel larvae taken on the cruise of the ‘ Margrethe.”
The smallest eel larva hitherto known was, it will be remembered, one measuring
