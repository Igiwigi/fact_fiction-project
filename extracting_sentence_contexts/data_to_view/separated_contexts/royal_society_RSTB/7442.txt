The odds against getting any one of these results by chance alone are not very great, and
since none of the comparisons is independent the results of y? tests may not be pooled. Therefore by familiar statistical tests these differences are of no significance. Nevertheless,
it would be incorrect to dismiss the view that the survival rates did in fact differ and that
by January there were relatively less survivors from the later samples. On block Â£,
where the whole population declined more rapidly (tables 12 and 17), six out of eight
August-marked voles were retaken in November compared with only eight out of the
nineteen new animals also released in September. Other data are too scanty for analysis.
