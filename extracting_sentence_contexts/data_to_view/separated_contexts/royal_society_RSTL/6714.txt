The one is a question of fact, no matter how it may be explained,
or how many different interpretations may be offered of it. The other is but an infer-
ence arrived at in the absence of evidence, and may result from imperfect means of
observation, or want of due care on the part of the observer in preparing the specimen. A new fact, if capable of being demonstrated to others, will be received at once as
true, but negative asertions, although supported by the authority of the most expe-
rienced, ought in matters of obseryation to be received with the greatest caution. It is one thing to assert that a cell has no fibre proceeding from it, or that a cell has
but one fibre, and another to state that no fibre or but one fibre has been demonstrated. Although many general facts are opposed to the notion of the presence of apolar and
unipolar cells, the existence of such cells is generally admitted and taught.
