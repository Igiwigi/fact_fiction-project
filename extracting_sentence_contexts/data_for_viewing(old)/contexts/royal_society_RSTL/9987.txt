CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM IN VERTEBRATE ANIMALS. 939

belonging to this layer are of extreme fineness and are unprovided with a medullary
heath, being at these parts merely axis cylinders.

Fach ridge is inserted into the main body of the wing, like a nail into a plank, with
a conical insertion consisting only of the molecular layer. The granular-basal part of
the wings forms a conical projection between each pair of molecular layers, and the pia
mater passes down between these, forming a double membrane which at the summit of
this conical process of the basal part divides into two, one accompanying each molecular
layer to the extremity of its insertion where ib disappears.

We have thus a series of ridges in alternately reversed positions, occurring in fact
S in pairs back to back. Where the wings are comparatively straight, the only contact
© that the ridges have with their basal portion is by the insertion at one edge ; but
S where curves and foldings occur the ridges become more or less distorted, and may be
= in contact with those parts by the sides as well as by the edges. With regard
S to the minute structure of these ridges and the remainder of the wings we will begin
D with a consideration of the molecular layers. These are generally separate from each
other at the summit of the ridge, but in some parts this layer of one ridge is continuous
5 with that of the next ; but in those parts where the wings end in a free edge, and
-= the ridges are on the external surface, the end of each ridge where it abuts on this
B free edge, goes round to join the next, forming a loop. The striated arrangement
= of the molecular layer is very apparent and the palisade cells (as one may translate
S Smeva's term © stiftzelle ”) are very well developed. The pia mater generally penetrates
