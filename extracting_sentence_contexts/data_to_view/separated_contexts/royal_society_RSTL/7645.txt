there is a cuspidal branch
the tangent to which coincides with that of the nodal curye; and there is a simple
branch the tangent to which may be called the cotangent at the pinch-point. In the
particular case where the nodal curye is a right line the section is the line twice (repre-
senting the cuspidal branch), and a residual curve of the order 2â€”2, the tangent to
which is the cotangent. 24, The pinch-plane, or reciprocal singularity //=1, is in fact a torsal plane touching
the surface along a line, or meeting it in the line twice and in a residual curve. Let
the line and curve meet in a point P; for the reason that the section by the plane is
the line twice and the residual curve, the section has at P two coincident nodes; that is,
the plane is a node-couple plane with two coincident nodes. The plane meets the con-
secutive node-couple plane in a line p passing through P and touching at this point the
residual curye.
