The hammering, which is evident around the feeder and
upon the upper surface in general, may thus be accounted for. When the cake is taken from the pot or crucible, the feeder
will most probably be slightly elevated, and the top of the
cake partially covered with small masses of ore and steel iron,

which the paucity of the heat had left either imperfectly sepa-
rated or unfused. These most probably, to make the product
more marketable, are--cut off at a-$econd_ heating, and the
whole surface hammered; smooth. |

I have observed the.;same facts and similar appearances-in
operations of a like nature, and can account satisfactorily for
it as follows. The first - portions of 'metal, that are' separated/jin experi-
ments of this nature, contain the largest $hare of the whole
carbon introduced into the mixture. It follows of course, that
an inferior degree of heat will maintain this portion. of metal
in a state. of fluidity, but that a much higher temperature is
requisite- to reduce the particles of metal, thus for a season
robbed of their carbon, and bring them into contact with the
portion first rendered fluid, to receive their proportion of the
steely principle.
