3 = 1411/(2°865 x 1°865) = 14°1/5°35 = 2°64.

Hence the platinum wire agrees closely in its properties with that used by
Dewanr,} and the platinum temperature scale given by it will not differ materially
from the normal platinum scale.

Tt was originally proposed to reduce all temperatures to the normal scale of the
hydrogen thermometer, but since the 6 of CALLENDAR’s formula in the case of pure
platinum compared with the hydrogen thermometer at 0°, 100°, and the boiling-
point of sulphur, appears to have the value 1°5, and when compared at 100°, 0°, and
the boiling-point of liquid oxygen to have the value 2°6, it is still somewhat uncertain
what the relation between the platinum and hydrogen thermometers is at low
temperatures. This fact seemed to render it advisable to give the results in terms of
the platinum scale, and along with them the results of conversion to the hydrogen
seale, on the assumption that CaLtenpar’s 8 is constant. When the connection
between the two scales at low temperatures is more definitely known, the results can
then be more accurately calculated in terms of the hydrogen scale.

* For pure platinum this should be +00389.
