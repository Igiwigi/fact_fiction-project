shoot of Hquisetum might be the result. A similar development in the spore
head might produce the strobilus. This view would harmonize readily wit
embryology of Hquisetwm as described by SapEBeEck, ‘ Pringsh, Jahrb.,’ vol. 11
by Bucutten ‘ Bibliotheca Botanica,’ No. 8, 1887.
But such development as this would involve the second prominent feature
we above noted aswanting among the Bryophyta (above, p. 491), viz., (2)
division of the archesporial layer to form isolated patches, instead of one conti
tissue. Is there any reason to think such a subdivision probable, and how ec
take place? To answer this question recourse must be had to comparison of
details of spore-production in the Bryophyta, and in the Vascular Cryptogams;
former are already provided by the researches of Lerraxrs, while I hope to add t
latter in subsequent pages. The full discussion of this subject must, therefore,
at the end of this memoir ; but in the meanwhile certain facts and conclusions f
study of the Bryophyta may be considered. It has been seen that sterile cells (el
in certain Liverworts appear to be massed together, and form solid tissues, as it
case of the columella ; it is, therefore, reasonable to expect that some similar pr
may occur again in such Liverworts, or other plants, as show sterile cells sea’
through their sporogenous masses. Now the Anthocerotee have by various
been recognized as plants whose sporophyte approaches that of vascular pla
than that of other Bryophyta (Lerrers, loc. cit.; Heft 6, p. 60; Prant, loc. cit., E
p. 62). In these plants a large proportion of the cells produced from the archesp 0
are sterile, and it would thus appear that a formation of sterile septa might
expected to result from a process of massing of these, such as is shown by
have produced the columella. But while noting this, I would not be unders
use it as more than an illustration, for I do not suppose that any living Bry
