structure and the evidence of association, renders it highly probable that the micro-
sporangiate strobilus just described may be of the same species with the female cones
of Lepidocarpon Lomazxt.

1. Structure of the “ Seed.”

In the calcified material from the well-known Burntisland beds, belonging to the
Calciferous Sandstone Series, “seeds” are not uncommonly met with, agreeing in
all important respects with those of Lepidocarpon Lomaxi. Some sections of these
Burntisland specimens are in the WriLtaAmson Collection,+ and were catalogued by
WILLIAMSON under the same name, Cardiocarpon anomalum, as the Coal-Measure
form. There is, in fact, very little to distinguish them, but the horizons are so widely
apart that a separate specific designation seems called for. I have therefore named
the Burntisland form Lepidocarpon Wildianum, associating it with the name of
Mr. Georce Wi1p, who has borne so important a part in the elucidation of these
fossils. It is a fact of some interest that this curious seed-like form of Lycopodiaceous
fructification should have already appeared at so ancient a period as that of the
Calciferous Sandstone deposits, which belong to the lowest strata of the Carboniferous
Formation. At present, Lepidocarpon Wildianum has only been found in the form of
detached specimens, in the mature, seed-like condition. Further search in the rich
material from this locality will no doubt reveal other stages of this fructification.
In the meantime, the specimens at present available are of value, as supplementing
our knowledge of the closely similar Coal-Measure form.
