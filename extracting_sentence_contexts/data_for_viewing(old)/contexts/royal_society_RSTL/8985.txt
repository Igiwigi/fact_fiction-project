carbonic oxide, and 42:4 of nitrogen. Gay-Lvs84ac gave the volume of these gases, at
a temperature of 0? C. and 760 millims. barometric pressure, as occupying 450 times
the space filled by the powder, the gravimetric density of which was *9. ProBert,
however, points out that Gay-Lvg4c's results, thus stated, are not possible, and suggests
that, by an error, the quantity of gas actually found has been doubled.

Propenr's suggestion is, from yarious corroborative circumstances, exceedingly pro-

bable, and is confirmed by the fact that Gavr-Lussac himself estimated the permanent,
gases at about 250 volumes.

In 1825 CneyrevL*, after drawing attention to the difference in the decomposition
of gunpowder when occurring explosiyely, as in the bore of a gun, and when taking
place slowly, as by ignition in open air, 8upposes the decomposition in the former case
to be represented by the equation

2K NO,+S+C,=K, S+N,+3CO,.

He points out that the actual constituents of gunpowder are employed in proportions

almost in exact accordance with this formula ; and the same view appears to have been
