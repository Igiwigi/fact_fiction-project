horizontal rows in the different plicee. As has already been shown by Ménvicaux
(62, p. 55, fig. 15), the apical filament is larger than the ordinary filaments in Pinna

pectinata. It is very large in Pinna nobilis and Pinna virgata (fig. 17B, af), but
) in Pinna nigra it is very slightly, if at all, larger than the ordinary filaments. There
is no intrafilamentar septum.

Limida.

The upper ends of the ascending filaments are united organically in longitudinal
series, and the upper edges of the ascending lamelle are free from adjacent parts.
The interlamellar junctions are septa. In Lima fragilis they extend only one-twelfth
of the height of the demibranch ; in fact, as septa, they may be said to be absent, for
the junction practically represents the bend of the filament. In the other species
‘they extend up from one-fifth to one-third of the height of the demibranch. They
are, of course, confined to the principal filaments. In Lima californica there is a
longitudinal blood-vessel in the ventral edge of the demibranch, but this appears to
be wanting in the other species. The interfilamentar junctions do not run across the
plica as horizontal septa, and the plical cavity is, therefore, freely open in a vertical
direction.

The apical filament is large in Lima fragilis, Lima hians, and Lima squamosa. It
is very large in Lima inflata, but in Lima fragilis it is of about the same size as the
other filaments. The average number of filaments in a plica is 11 in Lima squamosa,
12 in Lima fragilis and Lima ealifornica, 15 in Lima hians, and 18 in Lima
