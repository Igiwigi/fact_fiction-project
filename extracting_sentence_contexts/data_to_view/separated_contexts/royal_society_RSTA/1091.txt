High-harmonic generation pulse duration as a function of driving laser wavelength. As the driving laser is tuned to 8
longer wavelengths, spectral peaks merge and the spectrum becomes a continuum. The fact that this is a true continuum can 24
be verified using Fourier transform spectroscopy. In the case where the HHG emission is presumed to be coherent, this verifies 2S
that the emission is in the form of a single attosecond pulse, from [126]. :3

In experiment, the HHG spectral peaks are observed to rapidly become broader, while their
spacing shrinks, rapidly merging into an apparent spectral supercontinuum [93,125]. Virtually,
all HHG with driving laser wavelengths greater than approximately 1.5 pm is observed to be the
supercontinuum characteristic of emission during a single attosecond pulse.
