For the formula (A 7), for all r > 0 and 0.5 < 6 <1, the relative error does not exceed 10-! at

Using the fact that function gg(t) in the space of Laplace transforms is represented by the
rather simple formula (A 1), we can suggest one more approach for computing its values, which
is based on the numerical inversion of Laplace transform. Two reliable formulae of numerical
