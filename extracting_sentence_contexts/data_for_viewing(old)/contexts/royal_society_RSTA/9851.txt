at the curvature, for after all it can only be a guess, we can calculate the required
velocity. Near the earthâ€™s surface winds of 50 miles per hour, and extending
laterally over 400 or 500 miles, produce differences of pressure sufficient to show on a
weather chart the isobaric system of a deep cyclonic storm. The slope of the isobaric
surfaces at 9 km. is greater, in the ratio of 3:2, and hence the winds must be
stronger, but the velocities need not exceed 75 miles per hour. But the momentum
of such a wind system is very great, and it is hard to see how it can be originated
and how destroyed.

The Isothermal Region.

The explanation that has been given of the temperature distribution carries with it
an explanation of the fact that the value of H, is greater over the high-pressure area
than over the low. For if we take a line starting from A and rising vertically, then
turning and descending vertically to C, the displacement of the air along such a
line from A to C will carry with it the displacement of any peculiarity of the
temperature gradient. For the same vertical displacement simply alters the tempe-
rature of each element by the same amount, but leaves unaltered the difference of
temperature between any two elements of the vertical parts. Thus the isothermal
region, which begins where the abrupt change of the temperature gradient sets in, is
shifted bodily upwards over A and downwards over C, and the invariable phenomenon
of a high value for H, with the anticyclone and the low one with the cyclone is
produced. The slow warming by radiation over A does not alter the level, for
presumably the neighbouring strata are about equally warmed, but the readjustment
required to meet this -warming carries the isothermal upward again, and thus a
