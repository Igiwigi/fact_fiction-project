produced contractions, it has, in most cases, occurred that there was no Sign of in-
creased deflection in the needle of the galyanometer. Finally, bathing the nerves of
frogs arranged in piles with acid or saline solutions, the deflection, far from in-
creasing, rapidly diminished, at least in the beginning.

These facts, with which I paused, might have appeared in some manner favourable
to the idea that the induced contractions were the effect of an electric discharge
which accompanies the act of muscular contraction : notwithstanding this I termi-
nated the chapter referred to with the following words :—< I cannot take upon me
to affirm that the question is entirely solved, and I panse here from not knowing how
or by what way to advance to solve it,” 1

The importance, however, of the fact of induced contractions thus always appeared
to me very great, and consequently I have not failed to give my strictest attention to
the study of it, and I have reason to believe, latterly, with some success. I shall,
therefore minutely describe in this memoir all the experiments that I have instituted
upon the induced contractions, and I trust the reader will excuse the prolixity of the
description.

Before commencing a fresh series of investigations into the fundamental fact of
the induced contractions, I thought it necessary to repeat and vary the experiments
of which I have already given an outline, and which were directed to the purpose of
discovering whether there is a development of electricity during the contraction
of a musecle. In order to have a more fixed and considerable deflection, it was neces-
sary to employ piles consisting of a greater number of elements than those I had
