Con-
sidering that this specimen represents less than
one-third of the entire trunk, the number of stems
in the complete cross-section at this level must
have been well over 40. This would mean that the
original axis must have undergone at least six

successive dichotomies previously to the one
actually seen. This fact is of great use in a re-
construction of the false stem, for, if we knew the
minimum vertical distance required for the com-
pletion of a dichotomy, till the next one is initiated,

we could form at least a rough idea of the height ~’

of the trunk at the level of the section. OF AUSTRALIA. Ny
