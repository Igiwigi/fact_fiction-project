Were we to proceed to enumerate the combinations of hydrogen, chlorine, nitrogen,
and the other dyad elements, as indicated by the two hypotheses respectively, and com-
pare the systems thus indicated with the systems actually existing, we should find that
the combinations indicated in the case of hypothesis a* were twice as numerous as in the
case of hypothesis « ; and we should, in fact, on this hypothesis (a?) make a blunder in
every alternate statement, knowing neither more nor less about the result than we do in
tossing a halfpenny whether it will fall head or tail—a position very different to that of
one who, having obtained information that the coin is weighted, never makes any 8uch
mistakes at all, which is our position on hypothesis x. That the conclusions to which
we are thus brought as to the nature and relations of these dyad elements are truly of
a remarkable character is not to be denied ; but it is a sufficient reply to those persons
who make difficulties on this score, that they may just as reasonably object to the facts
on which these conclusions are based, which are equally remarkable with the conelu-
sions ; and, moreover, that the value of an hypothesis is to be tested, not by the coin-
eidence of its conclusions with our previous expectations, but by their agreement with
the facts which we wish to explain.

Now it may be contended, admitting it to be true that hypothesis « puts a correct
limitation upon these combinations, yet this adyantage is gained at too great a cost, It
rejects indeed (it may be said), and rightly, the combinations rejected by the empirical
law of Even Numbers, but, in 80 doing, opens the door of the system to a large number
of compounds totally unknown to us. Thus while we eradicate one set of impossible
existences, we introduce another. Where, it is asked, are the elements x, ,v..., or
