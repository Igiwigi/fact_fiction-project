their design against tsunami flooding was inadequate [12]. 22

Our emphasis will be the tsunami aspects of the Fukushima accident. We will briefly describe : Ss
what happened on 11 March 2011, and will explain what has been referred to as ‘a cascade of : s
stupid errors’ [13], which nobody in the field could have possibly ignored. We will also briefly : s
discuss the industry’s and regulators’s response which, in some instances, does not necessarily 73

follow an entirely different path from the one which led to the accident.

2. Tsunami setting

Tsunamis have been known and described by chroniclers in Japan for centuries. In fact, the term
has largely replaced the English term ‘tidal wave’ to eliminate any confusion with tides, much as
the latter is not entirely inappropriate, given that most tsunamis along open coastlines resemble
fast receding or ebbing tides. The geological setting of Japan is well known. Here, we will discuss
a few large tsunamis that have hit North East Japan (figure 1 and table 1), in chronological order,
events which were known in the literature and ought to have been known to regulators, scientists
and engineers involved in the safety assessments of Japanese NPPs.

Soloviev & Go [14] in their 1974 monumental work on tsunamis in the Western Pacific Ocean
refer to the 13 July AD 869 (known as the Jogan earthquake) event as especially strong in the
vicinity of Sendai and surmised that its triggering earthquake was an M ~ 8.6 with an epicentral
location approximately 120 km west of the 11 March 2011 event (figure 1). They refer to 19 studies
for this event in the period 1868-1969. Presumably on the basis of these studies, they assigned
