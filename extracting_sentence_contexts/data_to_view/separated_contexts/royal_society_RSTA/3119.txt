In the USA, any map associated with a presidential election makes clear that, while there
is often local (county, zip code) consensus on a candidate, there is huge spatial variation in
voting preference. In particular, there are clusters of local communities which will agree on a
candidate. Governing this clustering phenomena is the fact that opinions within a community
are not solely governed by the interactions within that same community. Outside voices, e.g.
the media, scattered friends and family, migrants and tourists, all play a role in the formation
of opinions at a local level. Therefore, isolated communities can be thought to be connected
by weighted, directed edges where each incoming edge weight is the probability of interacting
with individuals from the source community.
