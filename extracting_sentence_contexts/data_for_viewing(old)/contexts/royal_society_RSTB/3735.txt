(3) The Development of the Pineal Nerves.—The results arrived at above
regarding the arrangement of the nerves of the pineal organs in the adult
Sphenodon are confirmed in a very striking manner by a renewed investigation of
the development of these nerves which I have lately undertaken. It was very
necessary to do this as I was only able to give a very imperfect account of this
part of the subject in my earlier work (Denby, 1899, 0).

The developing pineal nerves are very well shown in sections stained either with
Ehrlich’s hematoxylin and Orange G, or with borax carmine and picro-indigo-carmine.
I have studied them in eight series of sections, of Stages O, P, Q, R, and 8, in
addition to those which I employed for my earlier work. In the latter they were not
nearly so well shown, owing to the fact that the sections were stained with borax

carmine alone.

a. Development of the Left Pineal Nerve.—Scuavrnstanp (1903), as I have
already pointed out, has, since my earlier observations were published, given a
drawing of a section (Taf. VIII, fig. 73) of an advanced embryo showing the
nerve of the pineal eye running from the eye itself to the superior (habenular)
