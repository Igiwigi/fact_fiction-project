Correlated with the greater steepness of the Sylvia is the big and more bluntly shaped
temporal lobe, and the more transverse course of the fissures that represent the inferior
temporal. The other feature, the steepness of the Rolandic, observed by both MrnGazzin1
(quoted by CunnineHaM, loc. cit., p. 189) and CUNNINGHAM (1892), may be due to a
smaller development of the frontal lobe in newborns. In this connection I wish to draw attention to the fact that in the 7th month foetus,
fig. A, Plate 37, the junction of the inferior frontal and inferior precentral fissures lies
in front of the temporal perpendicular, whereas in newborns it lies on it, and in a one and
twelve months child it lies behind it, as it usually does in the adult. With the increase of the frontal lobe in the adult this junction shifts further back-
ward,{ which again reacts on the Rolandic.
