Thus in a brief phrase is expressed a structural principle which governs the forma-
tion of the blood-corpuscle in all Mollusks.

The Bryozoa are to the Molluscan what the Pycnogonidz are to the erustacean series.
In the Bryozoa and Pycnogonidz the vital fluids are constituted in the organism into
a system, in s8trict accordance with the chylaqueous. How perfectly these two
instances prove that nature, in cases of simple organisms, gathers together and circu-
lates the nntritive fluids on the type and plan of this system, and not on that of the
true-blood ! This fact indicates in the former, with respect to the latter, a relation of
inferiority. In both the instances enumerated, the fluids notwithstanding exhibit an
advance upon the true chylaqueous fluid, in the fact that the corpuscles are more
highly organized, while the fluid itself is more perfectly fibrinized, indications both
of a higher degree of vitalization,

In the Tunicata the apparatus of the circulation is developed obviously above the
standard of the former. A heart and arterial trunks are detectable. The blood cur-
rents, however, are not determinate in direction. As in the larya of insects, the
portions of the fluid which accumulate in the peritoneal chambers oscillate to and
fro under the muscular contortions of the body ; presently, however, and at unequal
intervals, it obeys the impelling force of the heart, and advances in a definite orbit.
In the Cynthidee or Salpidee the fluids may be readily obtained for examina-
