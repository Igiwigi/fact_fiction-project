* Mr. K. G. Brair has read through the account of the Coleoptera, and for this my best thanks are due
to him. f Beetles showing diverse affinities have been grouped in the family Dryopide and by recent authorities
they are split up into three distinct families. BÃ©vrne (1926) has discussed the probable relationships of
the beetles of this assemblage, but in view of the fact that my collection has not yet been determined, I
refrain from referring to them by their distinctive names. The Psephenus- and Psephenoides-like larve
that I have collected in great numbers from several places in India are found living together in the same
stream. The former are characterized by the presence of free branchial filaments on the ventral side
(Inams, fig. 480), and the latter by the presence of a group of retractile anal gills (figured by Bovine).
