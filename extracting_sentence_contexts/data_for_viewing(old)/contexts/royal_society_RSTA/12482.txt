Fig. 1.

The sphere before use is attached to a small hydraulic hand-pump carrying a metallic
gauge, and tested to the requisite pressure by pumping water into it. In this process
the form of the vessel visibly becomes more spherical; the internal volume may
increase nearly three per cent. Leakages are now detected and marked. Subsequently
these are staunched with soft solder, applied while a vacuum is maintained in the
sphere. The sphere will now probably be quite gas-tight, but it must be further
tested when filled with gas by immersing it in water, and observing for some time if
any bubbles grow upon its surface.

The catchwater of platinum foil with which each sphere is provided, is arranged to
be easily removed. It is, in fact, hooked on to two little wire loops soldered to the
sides of the sphere.

The idle sphere, or counterpoise, is not, of course, tested. It is only necessary to
make sure that it is perfectly air-tight. It is closed when full of air at normal
pressure, and is as similar to the active sphere as regards material, weight, and
volume, as possible. The equality of volume should not be departed from to an extent
exceeding three or four cubic centimetres. Their thermal values are adjusted by
inserting calculated weights of copper wire into the idle sphere. It is easy to secure
that this in the first instance shall be the lighter of the vessels. More than an

approximate equality in the thermal capacities of the vessels is hardly requisite.
