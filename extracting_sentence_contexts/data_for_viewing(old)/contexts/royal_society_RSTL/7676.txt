any position of the parametric point upon it there corresponds not a proper conic but, a
line-pair; this may be called the discriminant-locus. We have also the threefold locus
the relation of which is expressed by the six equations

(be—f*=0, ea—g*=0, ab—I=0, gh—af=0, hf—bg=0, fg—ch=0),
which is such that to any position of the parametric point thereon, there corresponds
not a proper conic but a coincident line-pair. I call this the Bipoint-locus®, and 1 notice
that its order is =4; in fact to find the order we must with the equations of the
Bipoint combine two arbitrary linear relations,

(* Xa, b, et, Va h)=0,

(#'Le, 6, c, f, 9, h)=0;
the equations of the locus are satisfied by
a:b:e:f:g:h=e": Brig: BÞyi yu: us
(where «: 3:7 are arbitrary); and substituting these values in the linear relations, we
have two quadric equations in («, [3, y), giving four yalues of the set of ratios (a:B:y);
that is, the order is =4, or the Bipoint is a threefold quadric locus.
