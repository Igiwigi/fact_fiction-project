We have discussed
the evidence that the loss of uricase likely represented a true
‘thrifty gene’ [124]. The mutation occurred during a period
of near extinction of ancestral apes from global cooling [125]. Evidence that it might be a thrifty gene was shown by the
fact that inhibiting uricase can markedly amplify the ability
of fructose to induce metabolic syndrome in rats [126], while
resurrecting the ancestral uricase was shown to block the lipo-
genic effects of fructose in human hepatocytes [127]. Of note,
when the mutation occurred, it only doubled serum uric
acid levels (to x3-4 mg dI-') and thereby acted primarily to
protect against starvation as opposed to driving obesity
[128]. However, during the twentieth century, serum uric
acid levels rose dramatically in parallel with increasing sugar
intake and the rise in obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular dis-
ease [128].
