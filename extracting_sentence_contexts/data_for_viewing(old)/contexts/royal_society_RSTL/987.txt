matter, which enters into the composition of this cellular
substance, is evidently derived: from the alburnum.

These facts are therefore extremely favourable to the
theory of HaLes ; but other facts may be adduced which
are 'scarcely consistent with that theory.

'Fhe internal surface of pieces of bark, when detached from
contact with the alburnum, provided they remain united to the
tree at their upper ends, much more readily generate a new
bark, than the alburnum does under similar circumstances: a
similar fluid exudes from the surfaces of both, and the same
phenomena are observable in both cases. The cellular sub-
stance, however, which is thus generated, though it presents
every external appearance of a perfect bark, is internally very
imperfectly; organized; and the vessels which contain the
