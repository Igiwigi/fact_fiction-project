The scaling at small ¢ is proportional to p(0). (Online version in colour.)

A further characteristic of the system is the average waiting time (t,) between two reversals,

shown in figure 4b for different ¢. It is found that the inverse of (f,) scales as e(N-5)/2 at small : =
g, just as p(0). This translates the aforementioned fact that the width of the bottleneck controls :g
the reversals for small ¢. It is interesting to note that in the Kramers problem [66], which [3
consists of the escape of a Brownian particle from a potential well, a similar relation is found a)
between the mean first-escape time and the probability to be at the edge of the well. There, :8
the constant of proportionality can be computed in terms of the curvature of the potential.
