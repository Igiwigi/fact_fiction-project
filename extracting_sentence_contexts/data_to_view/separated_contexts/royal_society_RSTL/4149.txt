The explanation of the formation of the bands on the imperfect theory of
interferences considered in the preceding section is essentially defective in this re-
spect, that it 8upposes an annihilation of light when two interfering streams are in
opposition ; whereas it is a most important principle that light is never lost by inter-
ference. This statement may require a little explanation, without which it might
seem to contradict received ideas. It is usnal in fact to speak of light as destroyed
by interference. Although this is true, in the sense intended, the expression is per-
haps not very happily chosen. Suppose a portion of light coming from a luminous
point, and passing through a moderately small aperture, to be allowed to fall on a
screen, We know that there would be no sensible illumination on the screen except
almost immediately in front of the aperture.
