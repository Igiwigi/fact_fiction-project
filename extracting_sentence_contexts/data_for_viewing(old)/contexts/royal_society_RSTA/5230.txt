To see why climate engineering research might justify some reduction in mitigation, consider 72
that climate policy involves difficult trade-offs between morally important benefits and costs. The [4
optimal climate policy portfolio would balance the morally important marginal social benefits : Ae
from additional GHG emissions against the morally important marginal social costs of those : =
emissions.” The most important benefits of GHG-emitting activities include human development : 5

for the global poor, though many lesser benefits to others are also morally important. The
marginal costs come in the form of increased climate risk. Climate engineering, if it works
and is used wisely, would reduce the climate risk from—and therefore the marginal social cost
of—additional emissions. This would mean that the morally optimal level of mitigation, in the
presence of effective, wisely used climate engineering, would be lower than the optimal level
of mitigation in the absence of climate engineering. That is, the fact that me <img does not
necessarily mean that (i11ce, Ace, Cce, Sce) Yields a worse outcome than would (119, 49, Co, So). Thus,
if research led us to expect climate engineering could be used wisely and effectively, we might be
justified in reducing mitigation efforts.

The wisdom of reducing mitigation depends partly on how much of the reduced climate risk
comes from CDR and how much from SRM. If the relative benefits of (ice, Ace, Cce, Sce) depend
heavily on SRM, then two further ethical assumptions would be necessary to justify reducing
mitigation. The most important assumption is that deploying SRM is not intrinsically wrong.
If SRM is intrinsically wrong, then it would probably be wrong to deploy it for the purpose
of reducing mitigation and reaping the benefits of additional emissions. The other necessary
assumption is that, at least in the presence of climate engineering, the marginal social benefit
of further GHG emissions is greater than their marginal social cost. The first assumption—that
