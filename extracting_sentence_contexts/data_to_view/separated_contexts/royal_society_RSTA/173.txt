We depict these as springs
and generalize them to forces emanating from harmonic potentials so that the ‘spring constants’ can
be positive or negative. Singularities occur when either the generalized nearest-neighbour spring
constant vanishes or when the ratio of the spring constants between nearest and next nearest
neighbours is —4. In these cases the surface relaxation invades the full space (Salje 2008).

(Houchmandzadeh et al. 1992; Conti & Salje 2001; Salje 2008); secondly, the fact
that any heterogeneity is translationally invariant in an infinite body. A point
defect or an interface can, in principle, move between positions of equal energy
and (almost) equal entropy. Such a move will accommodate external agents
such as strain, electric fields or magnetic fields.
