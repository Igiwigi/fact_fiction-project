The first heating was for 1-5 hours at 230° G, and sufficed to produce a
crop of particles, shown in fig. 16, Plate 16, taken by ordinary light, with ring
illuminator, at the same region as is represented in fig. 8. Examination in polarized light, under higher magnification, showed the typical
figure. The fact that many of these particles are arranged ina straight line is a charac-
teristic which is discussed at length later. A second heating for 1-5 hours at 230° C
produced little change. Heating for 1 hour at 300° C led to the appearance of
further crystalline aggregates, and probably to some increase in size of those already
