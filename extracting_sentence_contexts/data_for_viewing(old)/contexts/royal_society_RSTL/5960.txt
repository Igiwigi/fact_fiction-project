been drawn from an examination of the following species:—S. alveolata, S. vesiculosa,
Leucodore cliatus (very favourable for this purpose), Amphitrite auricoma, Sabella @
sang vert, Sabella hospita (mihi). Of the Serpulide the author has only studied with
care the following species :—5S. triguetra, S. contortuplicata, S. lactea. Tn all the Sabel-
lide and Serpulidze the segmental organ is present in every ring of the body, except the
thorax and the caudal appendage.

The Nereid group.—Under the head of the Nereid group, for the purposes of this
memoir, several families of * errant Annelids ” will be included. Of the reproductive
organs of this group nothing whatever is known. No comparative anatomist has even
suspected the existence of the © segmental organ ” in any one of the members. STAx-
NIUs, KOLLIKER and DE QUaTREFAGES, and probably other microscopic observers, have
indeed established the fact that the ova and the spermatozoa are found on separate
individuals. Hence has been inferred the dicecious character of this group. Not one
single observation has ever been made by any of these observers as to the character of
the reproductive organs themselves. 'The author begs therefore to offer the succeeding
description as drawn exclusively from his own researches.

In every Nereid, the ciliated, looped, horseshoe organ to which the author has applied
the name of the © segmental organ,” exists without, a single exception.

The demonstration of this organ in Nereis margaritacen is attended by great difficulty.
It can only be accomplished either by the tedious process of placing annular sections of
the body under the microscope, or by the discovery of a young specimen at that age at
which the integuments are transparent ; and then it is only in the region of the tail of
