There remain then features of indicative but not of fundamental importance, such
as the asserted nature of the caudal fin-rays, which in their dichotomy do certainly
recall a Marsipobranch character in a most striking manner. We can offer no
observations of our own on the nature of these structures ; our specimens were not
well enough preserved, but Dr. BasHrorp-DraAN sees no reason why they should not
be dermal, and he considers the fact that they twice dichotomise supports him in
this view. The absence of ribs and limbs cannot by itself be regarded as furnishing
an argument for a Marsipobranch alliance. The arguments against such an alliance, however, have become much strengthened
in the light of additional knowledge; the characters of the cranium are foreign
to the Marsipobranch, the highly developed vertebral column equally so, while
the visceral skeleton is absolutely unlike anything known amorig existing
Marsipobranchs.
