But,
on the contrary, as with the Jarger angular distortions, the relation between the law of
8ubsidence in two sets of oscillations having different periods, with the same elastic
body in the same cireumstances, was not that which would occur if the molecular
resistance were simply proportional to the velocity of the change of shape in the
different cages. If the molecular friction followed this simple law, the proportionate
diminution of range per period would be inversely as the periods. This proportion
was not found to hold good, but the loss of energy was, in fact, as it would be if the
result were wholly or partially due to the * elastische Nachwirkung ”—elastic after-
working—as the Germans call it. * T shall be able to show that this is not the case if we eliminate the effect of the resistance of the air. +
