It is, of course, possible that the 6 material found in all the alloys from Sn 6 to
Sn 20 may be a series of solid solutions varying in composition throughout this range
of alloys, but the great similarity in the appearance of the 6, from its first appearance
in the scanty eutectic of Sn 6 to the moment when it fills the whole alloy in Sn 20,
makes us think it far more probable that it is a pure compound of constant
composition. Up to the present we have not been successful, by means of a chemical
solvent, in removing the « from such an alloy as Sn 16 in order to analyse the 6.

The character of the pattern of riband, bar and rosette, or fern-leaf, seen in the CD
alloys when cold and unchilled, is partly, we think, dependent on the greater or less
perfection of the transformations that take place during solidification. Too rapid
cooling during solidification will leave the grains somewhat copper-rich with some tin-
rich mother-substance round them; in fact, the D transformation will not be com-
plete. This will lead, when the 6 crystallises, to its doing so in broad ribands,
enclosing areas in which it is more sparingly distributed as rosette or fern-leaf. In
the chill at 558°, and the same is seen in the unchilled alloy of fig. 52, the 6 forms
many straight pointed bars. This peculiarity, which is first seen in Sn 20, suggests
the bars of Sn 21 and succeeding alloys.

The DE Alloys.—All slowly cooled ingots of the DE alloys, but especially the
higher chills, are more or less covered, particularly on the top, with a raised primary
crystallisation. This suggests bunches of grapes packed closely together, but some-
times, as in the upper chills of Sn 24 and Sn 25, there are suggestions of combs in
the form of long bars with rounded serrations. In the lower chills the grape pattern
alternates with patches of linear ruling, showing iridescence.
