of an inch from this point double of their mean velocity with
which they traverse the diameter. To produce this effect, the
force must (if supposed to act uniformly through this small
space) be increased 100 fold, or to an intensity upwards of
50,000 times that of gravity. Such considerations tend, if I
mistake not, greatly to enlarge our views of nature, and to
prepare us for the admission of the most extravagant numeri-
cal conclusions respecting bodies less within the reach of our
senses. That such minute proportions of extraneous matter
Should be found capable of communicating sensible mecha-
nical motions, and properties of a definite character, to the
body they are mixed with, is perhaps the most extraordinary
fact that has yet appeared in chemistry. When we see ener-
gies 50 intense exerted by the ordinary forms of matter, we
may very reasonably ask, what evidence we have for the
imponderability of any of those powerful agents to which 50
large a part of the activity of material bodies seems to be
owing ?

be produced in other metals than mercury and its alloys, when
