Taylor also discusses [2, p. 290] Osborne
Reynolds’ (1895) [3] and William Orr’s (1907) [4] ‘promising’ but unsuccessful attempts to
consider the stability related to Reynolds’ classic 1883 experimental results [5] for the transition
to turbulent flow in a pipe. Clearly, Taylor saw this as a challenge. In fact, he quotes Orr’s remarks that ‘It would
seem improbable that any sharp criterion for stability of fluid motion will ever be arrived at
mathematically’ [4, p. 75], [2, p. 290]. Taylor proves just the opposite by intentionally considering
flow between concentric rotating cylinders rather than between two parallel planes. Taylor
made clear that he was searching for an example where a mathematical representation could be
found to match observable results, and he ended up focusing on Rayleigh’s instability criterion
[6, p. 210] ‘so that a detailed comparison can be made between the results of analysis and those
of experiment’ [2, p. 290].
