Neighbouring septal surfaces bound to- Neighbouring septa united by true

verse (dissepiments).” (dissepiments). Tf now for the ‘“‘ caleareous nodule” in these definitions the fibrous fascicle be read,
and each group of fascicles be understood to represent a distinct growth-part of a
trabecular ridge, it will be seen that the definitions given by Prarz have been fully
corroborated by my work. Pratz’ definition of P. irregulares gives, in fact, the
main features of the Eupsammide, by which they may be distinguished from Pseudo-
astreine regulares (ef. below, ‘Table of Classification, p. 252, “ Successive” and
“ Contemporaneous Growth-parts”), The distinctions so carefully worked out by
Pratz are, therefore, fully justified, and I regard it as a backward step to unite
the two sub-groups under the one sub-family Thamnastreine. Moreover, I have
already shown that Prarz had right in distinguishing two kinds of synapticula—the
pseudosynapticule of the “ Pseudoastreine regulares” and the true synapticule
present in Fungine, &c. Astreomorphine, FRECH.
