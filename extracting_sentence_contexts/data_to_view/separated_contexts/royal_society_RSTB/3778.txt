The mere occurrence of such
rudiments does not, however, in the least postulate that any further members of
a decussate system are to be hypothecated, unless they can be actually proved to be
present (Lianrer and Tyson, 1912, Whorl II). f

The rest of the flower consists of a terminal ovule. There can be no doubt about
the fact-that it is an ovule, being composed of a massive nucellus, with central
megaspore and endosperm, and this is invested by two envelopes. The outer envelope springs from the extreme base of the ovule, and is enormously
extended tangentially to give rise to a wing-expansion, ultimately utilised in seed-
dispersal. To all intents it is a simple outer integument (Sykes, 1910); but,
following the use since the time of Hooxerr (1864), it may be convenient to still
designate it “perianth.”
