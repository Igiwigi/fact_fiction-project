that we see both by incident and reflected light; and, according to Bricker, the
reflection has the effect, that the light which has struck the sensitive elements of the
retina by impinging on them, strikes and affects them again on its return, at least in
those eyes, he says, which possess a Tapetum lucidum. Now we have seen that in

eyes which have no tapetum, the membrane of Brucu and the internal layers of the
choroid are transparent, and that the epithelial -layer is very translucent. We have
seen that in eyes which have a Tapetum cellulosum, the inner layers of the choroid are
opaque and colourless, the colour being exclusively due to the translucent epithelial
pigment crystals. Lastly, we have found that the Tapetum fibrosum consists of
certain layers within the choroid which are structurally coloured, the colour being to
some extent modified by translucent coloured epithelial crystals. I venture to think
that these facts must be taken into consideration in forming any theory of vision or
colour perception.

Having had occasion to study the work of LippMANN on colour photography, I
could not help being struck by the similarity of his device and the conditions which
