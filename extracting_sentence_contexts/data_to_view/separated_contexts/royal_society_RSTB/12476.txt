Intervening on Z; does, however, change fitness and this is a
source of confusion. By changing fitness, this intervention does
affect selection in the narrow sense of effecting change within
that generation. In fact, the definition of the selection coefficient
is a Price-equation covariance, cov(Z;,W;) [45]. But, not all of
this change extends across generations, as Fisher formalized
through his concepts of average excess, average effect and
breeding value. This is Fisher's third sword, which | will use
in the rest of this paper.
