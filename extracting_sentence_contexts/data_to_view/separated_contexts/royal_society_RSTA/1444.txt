The numbers seem to have been
maintained during these years by a succession of positive disturbances up to 1792 or 1793,
and the negative disturbances of the following years only just overbalance these and
leave a small negative total. This distribution of the disturbances seems to me to have some bearing on the question
whether we may perhaps tentatively regard the damped harmonic formula at which we
have empirically arrived as being something more than merely empirical, and repre-
senting some physical reality. As it seems to me, the disturbances do occur just in the
kind of way that would be necessary to maintain a damped vibration, and this suggests
that broadly the conception fits the facts. *

Clearly, however, a simple damped vibration, varying round zero, is not quite what is
wanted. One would rather expect a function of the form of the square of a damped
harmonic vibration, say,

= AE (1 =â€˜Gos'0t).
