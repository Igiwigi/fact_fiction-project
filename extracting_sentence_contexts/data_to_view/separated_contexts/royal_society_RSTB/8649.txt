The evolutionary advantage
to a species of being able to communicate more complex mean-
ings would have been (and remains) great; that is, there must
have been countless opportunities to extend unitary pre-existing
meaningful calls or gestures, but none were able to be taken. One plausible theory about birdsong is that it was a product of
runaway sexual selectionâ€”like the male peacock tail or outsize
antlers in male deer, or huge inconvenient-looking sexual
swellings in female baboons and female chimpanzees. Elabor-
ate singing abilities seem to have been preferred by mates,
despite making little direct contribution to fitness beyond the
fact that they were preferred. Sexual selection stands in con-
trast to natural selection, which rewards improved function
like a stronger beak or more efficient wings. Certainly, a com-
plex song can serve as a sign of a mate fitter in other non-song
respects.
