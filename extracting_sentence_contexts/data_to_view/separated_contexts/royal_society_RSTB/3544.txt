ApAray’s classical memoir (1897) contains important information on the subject of
giant fibres. The neurochords of Lumbricus are described as containing thin (with
sometimes one or two thicker) wavy neurofibrillz, some of which here and there are
seen issuing through the glia sheath into the fibrous mass of the cord. The neuro-
chords are homologised with the “ sensorische Schliiuche” of //irudo, but no reference
is made to the fact that Friepninper and Cerronrarne had traced the giant fibres
in Lumbricus into nerve cells, nor does ApATHY give any indication of the mode of
origin of the “neurochords” of Zuwmbricus or of the “sensorische Schliiuche” of
Hirudo, to which he compares them. Lewis (1898) investigated the nervous system of two Maldanids, Axiothea
torquata and Clymene producta, and concluded that the ‘ Leydig's fibres” therein
present agree in structure with those described by FrimpLinper. The contents of
“ Leydig’s fibre” are uniform throughout, so that it represents a single nerve fibre
and not a bundle of fibres.
