determined to be suitable for the analysis. Owing to the previous
knowledge of the positions of the heteroplasmic sites (from
sequencing of blood and cheek samples), in some instances, we
included samples with a lower depth. Samples with a sequencing
depth less than 1000x at the heteroplasmic site were included if the
depth of a minor allele was greater than or equal to 9x (unlikely to
be the result of sequencing errors), allowing a reliable measure-
ment of the MAF of these heteroplasmic sites. Ten samples were
excluded from further analysis because they did not meet these
criteria. The average sequencing depth across all sites was 7807x
(74-39 314) and across sites with depth less than 1000x was
498x. In fact, all but one site (in a single individual) had depth
greater than 200x. This single site had depth of 74x and resulted
in a MAF of approximately 16%; we included this data point
because at this site we observed MAF of 41% in cheek and 47%
in blood, and thus we expected (and observed) relatively high
MAF also in hair. A MAF of 1% was used as the cut off for a site
to be considered heteroplasmic, to avoid bias coming from PCR
and sequencing errors. The GaLaxy workflow is shown in the
electronic supplementary material, figure S1. The locations of
heteroplasmic sites in the mtDNA and the resulting amino acid
changes were also explored to determine whether the variants
were associated with any diseases [25-27].
