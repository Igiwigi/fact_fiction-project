by the ordinary means of leveling ®.

Section X.—Speculations on the action of the elevatory forces, and conclusion.

If we choose to enter on speculative grounds and to reflect on the secondary means
which have cansed these equable moyements, two solutions occur. But first I must
remark that the crust of the earth seems to yield easily to the forces which have
