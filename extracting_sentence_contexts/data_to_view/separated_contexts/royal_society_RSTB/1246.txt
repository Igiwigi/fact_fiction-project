280, Pl. 36); his results were in the main adopted and verified by Russow
1. Unters.,’ p. 147, and Pl. 9), but, as regards the origin and early history of
fporangium, the investigations of the latter add little to the facts already acquired
Hormeister. A point of difference between these two writers is in the reference
he sporangium, as regards its origin, to a single parent cell, Hormrtstsr speaks
he shields (sporangiophores) exhibiting “at five or six points a rapid cell-multipli-
eng by the division of one of the cells of the under surface of the shield,”
appears to refer the whole of each sporangium to one original cell. It will be
n that the essential part of the sporangium, viz., the sporogenous tissue, is refer-
le most cases with certainty to the successive segmentations of a single original
but the sporangium as a whole is of the eusporangiate type; this was recognized
ssow, and does not now admit of any doubt.
