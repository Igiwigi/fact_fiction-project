THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS. 117

By direct determination of the quantities of each kind of ion which pass in opposite
directions a given section of a solution in a certain time under the influence of a
given current, Hrrrorr and others have obtained various series of values known as
“migration numbers.” These are tabulated for the anions, and are often represented
by the letter n, so that

hn so-called “ mobility ” of anion
sum of so-called “ mobilities” of anion and kation’

In order to make this fit in with the present nomenclature, it will be convenient to
designate the Hittorf number by 7, and the corresponding number for the kation by
ni, Then we have

y= > Ne. > m+n, = 1,
and for the values of 2, 7 at infinite dilution
N, =G/A,) Ny= LA. Then, from equations (5), (6), and (7), we get

or

In the case of KCl and NaCl, equation (8) may be written in the form
BSB BN ct depo, (LE),

which is the relation between the hydration numbers and the migration numbers, and
equation (10) gives us

ty = N,+N,(B,—-B)(B+h*)* . 2. 2 1. (12),

There arises thus from our theory a simple linear relation between the series of
Hittorf numbers n, for an electrolyte and the corresponding series of values of
(B+h*)".. We shall see that this in fact holds, and that equation (12) gives us a
ready means for obtaining N,, the value of the Hittorf numbers at infinite dilution, a
quantity of great importance in the theory of electrolytes.

(b) Deduction of Constant for NaCl—In the former paper it was shown that in
the ease of KCl the function @ was of the form & = Bh7**, and that the value of B
was 3°33. This function was evaluated for KCl upon the hypothesis that the
modified Van ’t Hoff equation,
