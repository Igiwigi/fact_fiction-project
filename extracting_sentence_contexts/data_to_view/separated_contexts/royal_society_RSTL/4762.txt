The preceding experiments sufficiently fix the composition of triethylphosphine. This
compound is in fact triethylamine, in, which the nitrogen is replaced by an equivalent
quantity of phosphorus. The perfect analogy with triethylamine is also shown by the
deportment of the phosphorus-base with the iodides of ethyl, methyl and amyl. Tri-
ethylphosphine combines with these substances, forming well-crystallized and highly
characteristic salts, which may be regarded as iodide of ammonium, in which the nitrogen
is replaced by phosphorus and the hydrogen by the radicals of the alcohols.
