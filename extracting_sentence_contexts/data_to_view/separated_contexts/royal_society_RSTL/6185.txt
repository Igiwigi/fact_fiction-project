recorded as occurring in association with the mammalian and other organic remains 80
often found in such situations, and even these few exceptions have generally been viewed
with doubt or else entirely rejected. The conclusion, in fact, that man did not exist
until after the latest of our geological changes and until after the dying out of the great
extinct mammals, had become almost a point of established belieff. Although resting
mainly upon negative evidence and preconceived opinion, this prevalent belief was
strengthened by the failure of the many ill-observed and dubious cases which had, from
time to time, been brought forward, Owing to these circumstances there is little doubt
that cages really meriting inquiry have been neglected or overlooked. To name only a
few highly probable instances ;—

Meuse, and at elevations of about 200 feet above the river, s0me bones of man
associated with others of recent and extinct mammals: and he further subsequently
