We plotted
x as a function of the maximum size (max(b,c)) of the protein and showed that x increases with
the size of the AFP (figure 3). When the AFP is larger, ice has to grow around it more in order
to engulf it, and the engulfment resistivity is greater [38]. This stems from the fact that engulfing
larger particles into a crystal is less favourable energetically [39,40]. In figure 3, there are two obvious exceptions to our claim, wsswAFPIII and TRX-AFPIII. We
explain these using the Janus effect.
