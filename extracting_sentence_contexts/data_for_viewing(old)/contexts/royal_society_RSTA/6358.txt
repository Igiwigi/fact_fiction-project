with the « denoting convolution in time. Here, we recall that t represents the time period between
the removal of even-numbered vertical links in the medium (see (2.3)). Additionally, G solves (2.6)
with Q(t) replaced by 8(t)5m,0, where 4(t) is the delta function in time and 5,9 is the Kronecker
delta

One can then apply the Fourier transform with respect to n, denoted by a superscript F,
to representations (3.1) and (3.2). Using the fact they involve convolution-type integrals and
summation operations, they can decomposed into a product of transforms with respect to t and
m. As such, via appropriate changes of variable one obtains that the transformed functions have
the forms

UF (k) = QF (K)Geven(k) and VF(k) = Q*(K)Goaa(h)- (3.4)

Here, the transformed functions are defined as

(uF(, VE(k), OF) = | {U(n), Vin), Qn} e"* dn,

and we have
