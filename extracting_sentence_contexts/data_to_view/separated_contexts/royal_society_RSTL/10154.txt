Lodoicea sechellarum is of interest, nob only as affording one of the clearest
examples of the perforation both of the wall and pit membrane, but also because of
its very unique distribution (Plate 69, fig. 19). In Oncosperma the threads are excessively fine, and certainly snggest the extreme
probability of the existence of threads which are 80 delicate as to be invisible (Plate
69, fig. 21). In fact, I am inclined to believe that this really is 80 in 8nch endosperms
as Cocos nucifera. To this 8eed Martinezia caryctifolia presents a useful transition. With iodine it can be een that very fine threads do go through the almost 8mooth
walls, but upon treatment with picric-Hormanx's-blue the individual threads cannot
be distinguished, and only a blue coloration occurs.
