If all accelerated systems are equivalent, then Euclidean geometry cannot hold in all of
them. [5]

Towards the end of 1912, he realized that what was needed was non-Euclidean geometry. Einstein consulted his old school friend, the mathematician Marcel Grossmann, about the most
general forms of transformation between frames of reference for metrics of the form ds* =
Suv dx dx’. Although outside Grossmann’s field of expertise, he soon came back with the

2In fact, Henry Cavendish appears to have come to essentially the same result as von Soldner in an unpublished manuscript
of about 1784, inspired by John Michell’s paper of the previous year on the escape of light from a massive body. Clifford Will
[8] provides an intriguing comparison of how Cavendish and von Soldner may have each derived their result. Soldner’s result
can be found most easily from the deviation of particles under Rutherford scattering, for which cot A@/2 = (4x eym/zZe?)pv},
by replacing the electrostatic zZe? /4zrey by the gravitational GMm and setting vy =c and p= Rg.
