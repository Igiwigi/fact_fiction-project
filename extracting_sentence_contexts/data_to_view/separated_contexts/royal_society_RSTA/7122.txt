In fact, however,
& the particles of fluid in contact with the boundary must have the same velocity as the
< boundary itself; on the bottom, for example, they must be at rest. But quite near the bottom
6 the fluid is observed to be in motion with velocities comparable to that in the interior of
50 the fluid, so that in general there must be a strong velocity gradient near the bottom. This
sb implies that there is in fact strong vorticity in the neighbourhood of the bottom; and it
‘ will be seen that, even if the vorticity is confined to a layer of infinitesimal thickness, the
‘6 total amount of vorticity must still be finite. In an oscillating motion this vorticity will be
of alternating sign; and the question then presents itself: will any of the vorticity spread
-8 into the interior of the fluid, or will it remain in the neighbourhood of the boundary ?
4 In considering the diffusion of vorticity, the viscosity of the fluid must be taken into
2 consideration; for, although the viscous terms in the equations of motion vanish when the
S motion is irrotational, they do not do so when there is vorticity. Although the viscosity may
é be small it cannot be neglected near the boundaries; for it is found that, as the viscosity
2 tends to zero, so the thickness of the boundary layer decreases; the viscous terms in the
& equation of horizontal motion, which depend upon the second normal derivative of the
3 velocity, remain of finite magnitude.
3 A straightforward method of taking into account the viscosity would be to proceed by
g successive approximations as in Stokes’s solution for a perfect fluid; that is, in the first
A approximation to neglect all terms proportional to the square of the displacement; in the
second approximation to neglect all terms proportional to the cube, and so on—all the
viscous terms being retained.
