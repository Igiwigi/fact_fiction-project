He found a marked
increase in the rate of subsidence at higher temperatures except in the case of iron,
in which the number of oscillations made by the wire in damping down from an
amplitude of 90° to an amplitude of 10° at first increased with rise of temperature
and reached a maximum at 100° C., afterwards decreasing again and becoming
constant between 200° C. and 300° C, This minimum internal viscosity for iron at

100° C. was also observed in the present research, but it is not mentioned by many
experimenters. Srremntz* was the first to lay stress on the fact that there is a tendency in
metallic wires to accommodate themselves to a definite elastic state. In wires of
brass, silver, platinum, copper, iron, and steel examined by him there was a marked
diminution in the rate of subsidence produced by keeping the wire for long periods in
continual torsional oscillation. Lord Ketvin{ had previously stated that the rates
of subsidence of the vibrations of several wires tested by his students were much less
rapid after they had been allowed to rest for a week-end than when kept in continual
vibration.
