the origin of a step, which finishes usually in another dislocation of different sign. Therefore
we must study the behaviour of a step between two screw dislocations of opposite sign.
A picture of the surface in this case is shown in figure 14. We shall suppose for definiteness
that the line joining the dislocations is in the [0, 1] direction, and we let the distance between
the dislocations be d (figure 15). In real equilibrium (# = 1) the step will remain straight
between the two dislocations (figure 14), having the structure of a piece of step (0,1). If
a>1 the step will become curved (figure 14), and its shape, seen from above, under equili-
brium conditions, is the same as part of the shape of a ‘free’ nucleus passing through the
dislocations P, Q (figure 15). (Our calculations show in fact (appendix C) that the kink
density at a point in a step depends only on conditions in the immediate neighbourhood of
this point.) The diameter of this free nucleus will be /, given by (89) or approximately by
(62). If />d, there are two possible equilibrium positions: PAQ which is stable, and PBQ
which is unstable. For growth we require the transition PAQ-—> PBQ, and the activation
energy A, for this is half the edge free energy of the piece PBQ minus half the edge free
energy of the piece PAQ. This quantity is easily evaluated graphically. To find the free
_ energy of a piece of boundary we have merely to evaluate the area of the sector contained by
