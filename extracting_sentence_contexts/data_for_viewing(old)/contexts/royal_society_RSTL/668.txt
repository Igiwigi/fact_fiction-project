life, that any unusual deviation from its natural form and situa-
tion in the human body, has always been considered as a subject
of some interest by the physiologist ; such deviations have,
therefore, not unfrequently been submitted to the consideration
of this and other learned Societies. Many circumstances re-
specting the circulation of the blood, and respiration, wholly
unknown to our ancestors, have lately been ascertained; but
we are not as yet arrived at a perfect knowledge of these im-

still be acquired; and the reasoning upon these subjects will
