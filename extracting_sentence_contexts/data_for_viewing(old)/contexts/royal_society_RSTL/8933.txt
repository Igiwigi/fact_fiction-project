charged phial, as much fire as is received by one of
its ſurfaces is loſt by the other,

The fifth letter to Mr. Franklin is in relation to the
power of pointed non-electric bodies drawing off and
throwing off electrical fire, at a much greater diſtance
than obtuſe bodies do of the ſame kind. Our author
thinks, that Mr. Franklin has attributed more power
to pointed bodies, than, upon experiment he finds to
be true, ;

The fixth letter to Mr. Franklin is upon the ana-
logy of thunder with eleQricity. This is a fact at pre-
ſent fo well eſtabliſhed, as to admit of no doubt,
But our author cannot agree with Mr, Franklin in his
opinion, © that thunder is at preſent in the power of
« men, and that we are able to diſſipate it at our
« pleaſure : that an iron rod (ſuch a one as Mr,
« Franklin has dire&ted, and ſuch a one as has been
** made uſe of) is ſufficient to diſcharge of all its fire
