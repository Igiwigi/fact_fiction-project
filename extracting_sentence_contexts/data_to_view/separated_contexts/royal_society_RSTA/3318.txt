where $444(E,,0):= A(E) # A(E — n) F A(n — 0) F Ao), iM are regular multipliers, u’ is a
suitable quadratic modification of u, and R>4 is a quartic and higher-order remainder. The situation is different in dimension 1, compared to the dimension d = 2 analysed earlier,
because of the slow rate of decay of solutions. In fact, it turns out that some of the terms in the
right-hand side, which correspond to the cubic space-time resonances, cannot be integrated in
time. These cubic space-time resonances appear only in the phases ©,4_, ®;_4, @_+4, and
correspond to the frequencies (&,&, —&), (&,&, —€) and (€, —&,&), respectively. To remove the non-
integrable contribution, one can define the nonlinear profiles u*(t) by
