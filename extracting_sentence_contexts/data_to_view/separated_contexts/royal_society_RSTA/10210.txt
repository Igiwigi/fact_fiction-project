I have employed as the correcting
factor to 16° C. the value 1°00118. It may be noticed that the discrepancy between my ratio of hydrogen to oxygen
and that of M. Lepuc is partially explained by the fact that my comparisons were at
16° C., and his at 0° C,

The uncorrected number for nitrogen (14°003 corresponding to O = 16) has already
been given,§ and contrasted with the 14:05 obtained by Sras. This question
deserves the attention of chemists. If AvaGapro’s law be strictly true, it seems
impossible that the atomic weight of nitrogen can be 14°05.
