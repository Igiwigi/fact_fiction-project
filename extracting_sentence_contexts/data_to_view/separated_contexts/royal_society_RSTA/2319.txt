Here again, as regards the absolute dimensions of the optical ellipsoid along its
three axial directions, as indicated by the right-hand series of ratios, the ammonium
salt stands just beyond the rubidium salt. In the left-hand series, in which the 8
axis of each salt is the reference dimension for that salt, the copper group shows its
individuality in the fact that the ratios for the ammonium salt are the lowest or
highest, instead of, as in the other groups, being intermediate between the values for
the rubidium and cesium salts. Molecular Optical Constants.—These are set forth in the next three tables, for all
four salts, the new values now given for the densities having been employed in
recalculating the values for the three salts containing the alkali metals. The specific refraction and dispersion of the ammonium salt stand out prominently
higher than those of the three alkali-metal salts.
