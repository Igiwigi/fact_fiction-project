If now we take sin y, a number like }, to represent first-order smallness, then 7, is of
order —1, and, using the small machine discussed by Jones, we take rs’ to be some-
what less than unity. We shall use the equations (18-17) with yas independent variable. It is, in fact, quite convenient to use @ if we desire to do so, but it seems more reasonable
to use y in the case of a spin in which once again a feature is the increase of y always
in the same sense. At stalling incidence, k, is a number like 0-6 for conventional machines. Further,
Xq> Yp> ¥, ave always negligible, while z, is practically zero at the stall.
