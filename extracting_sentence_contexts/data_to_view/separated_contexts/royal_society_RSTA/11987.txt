We must therefore find some other bond for the atoms of a molecule,
in addition to the hydrodynamic one and at least of the same order of magnitude.
= This is afforded by the attractions of the electric charges of the atoms, which are
8 required by the theory of electrolysis. But even now about half of the molecules
ct would be made up so that the atoms in them assist each other’s magnetic effects,
2 unless we suppose each molecule to contain more than two atoms, arranged in some
B sort of symmetry. There is however no course open but to take all matter to

‘6 stance in the aggregation of the molecules of iron compared with other molecules.
5 The small magnetic moment of molecules of most substances may in fact be explained
7g more fully on the same lines as their small electric moment (§ 64). The vortices will

be quite permanent as regards both atomic charge and electric intensity, so that the
8g explanation of diamagnetic polarity given by WEBER, on the basis of currents induced
- in the atomic conducting circuits, cannét now stand.*

it It is otherwise with the motion of translation of a small charged body: the intrinsic twist of
pil the surrounding medium is carried on with it, and the effect of the movement is thus to impose
Ai an additional twist or rotation round the line of motion (§ 59).
