This is more difficult than for gallium, first because of the
presence of the independent (four-thirds) frequency, and secondly because the amplitude
varies more strongly over one full cycle than it does for gallium. Owing to the difficulty
of reliably ‘idealizing’ a cycle to eliminate the amplitude modulation it was decided to try
synthesis rather than analysis, and after some trial and error it was found that the expression

1, _f,
A, I;

a{r)—sin (6—¢) —0-4sin (40 + 100° —44) + 0-4sin (20+ 30°—2¢)} = (12)

could be used as the basis of a representation of the low-temperature curves at y = 20° in
figure 12; here ais positive, 0, as in (10), stands for 27E,/fH and ¢ is for the moment arbitrary. To obtain a still closer representation, the amplitudes of the three periodic terms in (12)
were varied in accordance with the appropriate values of the relevant parameters; it
was found that to avoid too rapid decay of the four-thirds frequency term the parameter x
had to be taken as 0-3° K, a value much lower than the 1-5° K found for the main frequency.*
The final result is shown in figure 12, and it can be seen that it does give a fair representation

* The calculation of the modulation was in fact somewhat simplified by assuming that the amplitudes
of the successive terms in (12) fell linearly from their initial values at 1/H = 0-65 x 10~ to final values at
about 1/H = 1:3 x 10-* of 0-72, 0-72 and 0-32 of the initial values. The use of a linear rather than exponential
interpolation is not likely to cause any serious distortion. VoL. 245.
