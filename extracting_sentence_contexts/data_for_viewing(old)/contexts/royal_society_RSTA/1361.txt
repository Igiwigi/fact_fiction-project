ATc(p, V) = m(Cj — Coo) =

and IG (Pg, Pp) = Pepe exp Ic(oo).

This contribution defines crystal growth in an isothermal solution without the curvature and
kinetic terms. As before, the concentration undercooling is a function of p and V at a fixed value
of flow velocity U.

(iii) The Gibbs—Thomson and kinetic contributions

The curvature contribution reflects the fact that the phase transition temperature depends on the
solid/liquid interface flexure and takes the following form in two- and three-dimensional cases

2doT,
9 Q two-dimensional 1
p 2i-ldoT,
AT (0)=) or AT,(p)=——*-8, (.14)
AdoT,
9 Q three-dimensional,
Pp

where again j=2 and j=3 in the two-dimensional and three-dimensional cases. Note that
expression (3.14) does not work for a three-dimensional crystal in the form of an elliptical
