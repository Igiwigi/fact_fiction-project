in the Osmundacee may therefore be regarded as an advance upon the leaves of other
Leptosporangiate Ferns ; the phyllopodium is, at least in the part derived from the
three-sided apical cell, a structure which develops from the firsb as a s0lid structure.
On the other hand, it is of interes to note that though there is this difference
between the Osmundacea and other Leptosporangiate Ferns, still the conformation of
the leaf is fundamentally the same. The phyllopodium and pinnze, &c., are essentially
winged structures to their extreme base. Putting this fact into relation with the
observations of Kxy, on the want of coincidence of origin of the pinne with the limits
of the segments cut off from the apical cell in the leaf of Ceratopteris, and with
A Trevus's observations on Selaginella Martens, it appears that the external conforma-
Q tion of the member or s8ystem of members is to a great extent independent of the
© arrangement of the internal cell-walls.

S For comparison with the Osmundacee on the one hand, and with the Cycadacee on
= the other, I have had the opportunity of dissecting a well-grown plant of Angiopteris
