Although I have not even yet completed all the experiments which it is desirable
to make with reference to this subject, I have this year s0 far added to their number

epitome of the main facts regarding artificial rhythm has previously appeared in the
*Proceedings of the Royal Society '; but of course it will now be necessary to give a
