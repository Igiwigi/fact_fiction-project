universal [55]. A locally consistent tile assembly system is one where tiles bind without
mismatches, and with binding strength of exactly 2. This sub-model is quite expressive: the
standard methods to simulate Turing machines with tile assembly systems are locally consistent,
as are many systems that have been implemented in the laboratory to date with DNA [10-15].
This begs the question: are locally consistent systems capable of simulating the full model? Recent
work by Becker & Meunier [49] shows that the answer is ‘no’. In particular, their results show that
any class of tile assembly systems that has no mismatches, or disallows excess binding strength,
cannot simulate the abstract Tile Assembly Model.°

The result tells us that at least some of the tricky aspects of the intrinsic universality simulation
in [46] are required. In particular, in that simulation binding mismatches occur in numerous places
(often as a mechanism to decide which of the competing parts of anm x m simulator supertile will
‘win’ a competition to decide which simulated tile the supertile encodes). The fact that systems
without mismatches cannot simulate those with mismatches [49] tells us that this aspect of the
simulation is required. One of the key innovations in [49] is to generalize the window movie
lemma (a pumping lemma) from [45] so that it can be applied in significantly more complicated
settings. It will be interesting to see if this generalized ‘bisimulation lemma’ finds use elsewhere.
Finally, Becker & Meunier [49] show that 3D mismatch-free tile assembly systems are intrinsically
universal and leaves open the question for 2D mismatch-free systems.

It remains as future work to further characterize the power of interesting subclasses of the
abstract Tile Assembly Model, and in particular, to separate such subclasses. Work in this direction
will enable us to understand exactly which of the model’s features are required for specific kinds
of global behaviour.
