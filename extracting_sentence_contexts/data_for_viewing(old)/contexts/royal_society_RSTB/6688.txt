It is a striking fact that this sulcus ‘y’ should occur in many of these brains ;
and not only that but also that the figure of the Australian brain which is depicted
by Exxior Smrrn should be a perfect example of the type of occipital region showing
vertical folding of the area striata which occurs in a large number of these brains
(see group 5). S.2.R.,in which I have also labelled the sulcus ‘»’, is almost an exact
copy of the right side of the Egyptian brain depicted by him. In Q.2640.L. (Plate
31) there is the difficult sulcus bearing some resemblance to the sulcus *y?, but it
ends anterior to the sulcus occipitalis transversus instead of posterior to it. ELLior
SmiTH is inclined to the opinion that the sulcus ‘»’ is related to the sulcus occipitalis
transversus, but there are difficulties presented by S.9.R. in accepting this inter-
pretation. It is perhaps an expression of the fact that in these cases the unfolding
of the occipital operculum has not progressed as far as it does in more highly developed
brains. It is the difficulty of giving exact definition to the term “* Affenspalte”’
suitable for all cases. The difficulty is lessened by realizing that names cannot
imply all that is involved in the changes which are taking place in this region, or,
in fact, in any region of the brain. (See Kooy, 1921, fig. 22.)

In S.2.R. the sulcus ‘y’ is confluent with the sulcus occipitalis transversus (17);
