Figure 2. Our best substitution models cannot yet address difficult phylogenetic issues, even at shallow depth. We assembled supermatrices by concatenating the
translated mitochondrial genomes (12 genes) of nine slow-evolving bivalves (Unionoida), nine fast-evolving bivalves (Pteriomorphia), nine gastropods and
nine outgroups. Seven different outgroups were considered, thus resulting in seven different supermatrices, each one containing 36 species and 2016
unambiguously aligned amino acid positions. We then analysed all supermatrices using RAXML [85] and PHYLOBAYES [59] under four different substitution
models: Lg + I) GIR + I CAT + Iand CATGTR + I” Bootstrap proportions (LG and GTR) and posterior probabilities (PPs; CAT and CATGTR) for the monophyly
of bivalves (upper tree) and for an alternative (LBA) topology, in which fast-evolving bivalves are attracted by the outgroup (lower tree), were computed from 100
bootstrap pseudo-replicates or from two replicate chains per outgroup/model combination, each one run for 10 000 cycles. The burnin was set to 1000 cycles. In the
associated table, outgroups are sorted by descending phylogenetic relatedness to molluscs, not evolutionary distance, to illustrate the fact that the latter parameter
is the one that really drives the results. To see this, compare PPs for Hymenoptera versus Maxillopoda, two arthropod clades.
