This result is of very little use for application. If the co-efficients (z,) are needed
for particular values of z they can be very rapidly calculated by means of equation (15),
while if their general values are to be tabulated, equation (16) will serve to calculate
them in succession,

Purther, 2B, is the same kind of function as «,, in every way except that it does not
contain c; ; in fact 2B, is the 8ame function of Cc, cg, . - « Ca—gs that 4,1 is of 0, &, » +»
