The eye reads all this in merely looking at the end view of the skull (Plate VIIL.
fig. 8), which shows a curious piece of architecture, the Keystone of which and the
lesser and greater wings thereof are produced and snagged. Five bony buds were
during the first season grafted upon each swelling ear-sac, and they have transformed
those simple encasements into the angular, ridgy, and winged mass which I have por-
trayed in figs. 1, 2, & 8 in Plate VIII. All these, save one, can be seen from the
upper surface (fig. 1); they are the © sphenotic” (5.9.), the © pterotic” (pt.o.), the
* epiotic” (ep.), and the * opisthotic” (op.): the © prootic” (pro.) can be seen from
beneath (fig. 2), partly sliced away from the outside (fig. 3), and in transverse section
(figs. 4 & 5). The inner view (Plate VII. fig. 4) and the outer (Plate VII. fig. 3, pro.)
are most instructive as to the most constant of the periotic centres. All the figures show
how massive the periotic cartilage and bone becomes, and yet the labyrinth is only very
partially imbedded in the mass. I borrow from the study of a prior stage the fact that
the prootic commences in the thin anterior edge of the shield behind the exit of the first
division of the fifth nerve, but enclosing the second ; also that the © sphenotic” begins
over the ampulla of the anterior canal, the © pterotic” over the ampulla and arch of
the horizontal canal, the © epiotic” over the arch of the posterior canal, and the
* opisthotic” over its ampulla.

The prootics nowhere display such curious and unlooked-for characters as in the
MDCCCLNXI1L. P
