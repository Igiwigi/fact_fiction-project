This group is well defined and confirms very closely the values of the main triplet
separations already adopted. A similar multiplet appears in Al II, with its first line
at 4.1767 -6 (v = 56574), and in Mg I with the first line at 4 2783 (v = 35922).

The highest term of the triplet series is a p term, but a still higher term is to be
expected in connection with the associated singlets, so that the p term in question
gives no direct indication of the normal state of the doubly-ionised silicon atom.

Comparison of Triplets of Si 111, ALIT, and Mg I.

In accordance with the normal atomic numbers of the three elements a close similarity
between the spectra of Si III, Al II and Mg I is to be expected. All three spectra do,
in fact, include triplet systems in association with singlets. The three atoms in the
states indicated by the symbols have the same number of external electrons, but the
nuclei differ in mass and charge. The effect of mass is so small as to be negligible in
the present discussion, but, as previously explained, the effect of increased nuclear
charge is to displace the spectrum as a whole to the region of short wave-lengths.
