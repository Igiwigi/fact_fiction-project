The expected test lengths are approximately given by

(i) Signal-to-noise ratio

In the case where the observed data are normally distributed as in (2.4) and (2.5) we have that
D(follft) = D(fillfo) = 27/207. The ratio 2/0? is often referred to as the SNR and it follows from (2.12) and (2.13) that in
the Gaussian case, increasing the SNR decreases the average test length under both hypotheses. A practical consequence of this fact is that if the SNR can be increased (e.g. using signal processing
techniques—see, for example, [18]) while preserving the Gaussian data output, then this will
increase the average speed of detection. This ratio is also important in continuous-time sequential
analysis due to the Gaussian nature of the Brownian motion (see §4). More generally, it can be seen that the relative entropies, or Kullback—Leibler distances,
between the densities f; and fo are inversely proportional to the expected detection delays.
