And this may in fact be the
answer: as with eukaryotic sex, a plurality of explanations
must be considered [77]. While Haemophilus may become com-
petent when it is hungry or to repair DNA damage,
streptococci, H. pylori [36] and L. pneumophiliae [37,78] may
only do so when they are damaged, while A. baylyi [42] and
Neisseria meningitidis [79] are constitutively competent
(although not necessarily all cells in the population at the
same time). However, a consensus option may lie in the fact
that not all transformable DNA is of equal appeal or value to
each bacterial species. Most obviously, non-homologous
DNA is a poorer substrate for recombination than homologous


DNA. But it goes further than this.
