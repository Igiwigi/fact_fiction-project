D. NOKL PATON ON HEPATIC GLYCOGENESIS. To draw such a conclusion from the former fact shows a want of appreciation of
the relationship of glycogen to the sugar, so clearly recognized by BERNARD. Itig
when a supply of glycogenie (7.c., sugar yielding) material exists in the liver thatit
is stored as glycogen, just as in a resting gland cell, when there is no call for mucin, â€”
or the special zymin, an accumulation of mucinogen or of zymogen occurs. If the
demand for sugar in the organism is urgent, the liver is deprived of the material for
the formation of this substance.
