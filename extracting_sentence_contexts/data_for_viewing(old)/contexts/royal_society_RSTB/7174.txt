meristem. Near the base of the vasculated region the stele is a small solenostele; higher up
it becomes a medullated protostele (figure 59, plate 27) ; and still higher up a solid protostele
with a central core of xylem (figure 61, plate 27). This shoot became attenuated and later
stopped growing; the meristematic character of the apex was lost and the distal region of
the shoot became parenchymatous. Sections taken progressively nearer the distal region
showed a decrease in the cross-sectional area of the protostele (figure 60, plate 27) until
eventually it faded out, the whole cross-section of the shoot being occupied by parenchyma.
The attenuation and ‘parenchymatization’ of the apical meristem, with concomitant
disappearance of vascular tissue, has been observed in other ferns (Wardlaw 1945).

It has been shown that the shape of experimentally induced solenosteles, as seen in
transverse section, follows the contour of the incisions. Further evidence of this fact has
been obtained during the present investigations. Figure 58, plate 27, shows the vascular
system differentiated below an apical meristem which had been isolated on a rectangular
panel of tissue; the solenostele is approximately rectangular in cross-section.

Solenostelic buds were common in the experimental materials under consideration. In
the classical works on stelar morphology in ferns, the view has been advanced that the
solenostele is a stage in the progressive elaboration of the protostele (Bower 1923). That this
is so in the normal development is not in doubt. It is also held that the solenostele marks
an evolutionary advance on the prior, more primitive, protostelic condition, this being
borne out by the facts of ontogeny in solenostelic and dictyostelic ferns. A point of some
interest which has emerged from the present investigation is that in some of the large,
rapidly growing, induced buds, there is no protostelic stage, the vascular system being
