The radiation from air, it will be remembered, was neutralized by the large Leslie's cube,
and hence the 0? attached to it merely denotes that the propulsion of air from the gas-
holder through the argand burner did not augment the effect. Oxygen, hydrogen, and
nitrogen, sent in a similar manner over the ball, were equally ineffective. The other
gases, however, not only exhibit a marked action, but als marked differences of action.
Their radiative powers follow precisely the same order as their powers of absorption.
In fact, the deflections actually produced by their respective absorptions at 5 inches
tension are as follow :—
