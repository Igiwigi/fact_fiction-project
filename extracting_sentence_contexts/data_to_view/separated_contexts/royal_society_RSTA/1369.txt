Any prime through
| meets the quadric cones in quadric conical surfaces, and these, having the same tangent
plane along /, meet further in a conic which must lie on I;. Thus I; contains »?
conics lying in primes through |, and it is therefore a projected Veronese surface and
representable on a plane o by conics. There will be «4 of these conics ; so that they
will satisfy one linear relation ; and in fact it is known that they have a fixed self con-
jugate point pair XY, and that any two points which separate XY harmonically corre-
spond to the same point of the double line 1. Any line of w meets the line XY and
corresponds to a conic of I, touching II at some point of /. Any quadric cone which

touches II along ! will meet such a conic in just two free points, and the curve in which it
meets I, will therefore be represented on o by a conic.
