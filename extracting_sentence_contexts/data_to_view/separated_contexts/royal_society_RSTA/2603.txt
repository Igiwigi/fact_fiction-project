The properties plotted on figure 4 are directly derived from the data and do not involve
assumptions relating to a physical model. The time scale of the mixing and cooling processes
cannot be directly estimated from these properties, but an examination of the relative rates of
mixing and cooling may provide observational constraints on simple models of fluid convection
within a sill. The fact that a record of concurrent mixing and cooling is preserved in the melt

inclusion observations indicates that the time scales of mixing and cooling must be similar. As a

will be demonstrated below, this equivalence of time scales provides a means of estimating sill :s

thickness.
