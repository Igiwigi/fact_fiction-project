It would appear, therefore, that from two molecules of the organo-metal, one equi-
valent of ethyl only is displaced by the negative chlorine, or the compound group 50,
Hitherto my attempts to produce a lead base richer in ethyl have failed. Experiment
Shows that if chlorine be passed over the sesquiethylated chloride, the decomposition
proceeds beyond the removal of the additional equivalent of ethyl; in fact the salt
enters into combustion and is entirely destroyed. The aqueous solution of the chloride
appears also to be unaffected by a stream of chlorine gas. Chloride of lead is not throwh
down.
