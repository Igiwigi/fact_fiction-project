affected are the heat-rays lying beyond the range of the visible spectrum. Accordingly
T brought a heated iron just ceasing to be red close against the large bell-jar which
contained the numerous specimens of Sarsia ; but not one of the latter approached the
heated metal.

From these observations, therefore, I conclude that in Sarsia the faculty of appre-
ciating luminous rays is present, and that this faculty is lodged exclusively in the eye-
specks. My observations on the other genera of Meduse in this connexion are not,
yet complete.

d 2. Effects of various Poisons on the Locomotor System of Medusw.â€”As this com-
munication has now grown to an undue length, I shall reserve for a future paper many
facts of great physiological interest regarding luminosity, general distribution of the
supposed lines of discharge, coordination of the centres of spontaneity, rate of transmission
of contractile waves in different genera and under various forms of section, &c., and shall
conclude what I have to say at the present time by describing the effects of a few among
the poisons I have tried upon the Medusz, choosing those upon the list which most
tend to prove the identity of the specialized marginal tissue of these animals with
nervous tissue in general.

(a) The anwsthesiating influence of chloroform and ether is most decided. 'This
fact, I find, has also been observed by AGass1z; and he remarks in effect that even if it
stood alone it ought to be considered sufficient to demonstrate the presence of nerves
in Meduse. Without straining our deductive powers quite s0 far as this, I think that
the marked influence of chloroform and ether upon the Medus may properly be taken
