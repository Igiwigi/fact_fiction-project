No
investigations have hitherto been undertaken to decide the question in insects that
undergo these changes, nor have any experiments been made to show that a repro-
duction of lost parts is common also to the whole of the Class Myriapoda. At a meeting of the Entomological Society in November 1839*, I exhibited a spe-
cimen of Scolopendra sb-spinipes, which had the eleventh leg, on the left side of the
body, 80 much smaller than the corresponding one on the right, although otherwise
perfect in regard to the number of its articulations, that I regarded it as a marked
instance of reproduction of the limbs in that class. As no experiments had then been
made to prove the fact, this opinion was disputed, and the instance pointed out was
considered as merely one of an arrest of development+. Since then it has been
shown, as first noticed by Muzery, that a reproduction of the legs most certainly
takes place in the Phasmidce ; but it is still doubted whether it can occur in the Lepi-
doptera, and other tribes that undergo a complete change. In the summer of 1841, and also in 1842, I made a series of experiments on this
subject, on the Myriapoda; and during the present summer have completed a similar
