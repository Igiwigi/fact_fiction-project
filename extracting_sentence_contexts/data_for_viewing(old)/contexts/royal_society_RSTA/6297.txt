Crucially, we cannot only study the logics of a theory T based on intuitionistic logic but, given
an intermediate logic J, we can consider the theory T(J) obtained as the closure of T under J. de
Jongh et al. [8] studied these theories and defined the de Jongh property as follows.

Definition 2.8. Let J be a propositional or first-order intermediate logic. A theory T has the de
Jongh property for J just in case L(T(J)) =] if J is propositional or QL(T(J)) =] if J is first order.

We also say that a theory T satisfies de Jongh’s theorem if L(T) =IPC, and that T satisfies de
Jongh’s theorem for first-order logic if QL(T) =1QC. To illustrate research in this area, we now give
an incomplete history of de Jongh’s theorem for arithmetical theories (see de Jonghet al. [8] for
a more complete history). De Jongh [3] proved that L(HA) = IPC—; in other words, he proved
that HA satisfies the de Jongh property for IPC. Leivant [9] showed using proof theoretic means
that QL(HA) = IQC; van Oosten later gave a model theoretic proof of the same fact. De Jongh
et al. [8] proved that HA has the de Jongh property for several classes of intermediate logics. The
following propositions are immediate from proposition 2.5.

Proposition 2.9. Let TCS be theories in the same language. If A is a tautology of T, then it is a
tautology of S. In particular, L(T) C L(S) and QL(T) € QL(S).

Proposition 2.10. Let J be a propositional or first-order intermediate logic. If T C S are theories in the

same language and S satisfies the de Jongh property for J, then so does T. In particular, if S satisfies de
Jongh’s theorem, then so does T.

A first crucial observation on the admissible rules of a theory is that these are bounded by its
