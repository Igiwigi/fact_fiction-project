which the animal is placed. Trmcen (24) has used this method with success f
the purpose of intoxication of Eels with strychnia, obtaining evidence of absorpti
of the drug in one and a-half hours when six milligrammes of strychnia were add
to the litre and a-half of water in which the Fish was swimming. I have kept Eels
for two days in ‘15 per cent. solution of atropine sulphate aérated by a Bunsen pump,
with apparently little effect as regards general vital phenomena. The animals were
lively at the end of this period, and though the pupil was slightly dilated it reacted
to light, yet chemical tests applied to proteid free watery extracts of the livers
showed that atropine had been absorbed.

The removed skins of such atropinised Eels are found to give either a very feeble
ingoing current of rest or outgoing currents which do not reverse with time. This
fact is perhaps best explained upon the hypothesis that atropine diminishes the
activity of the glandular preparatory processes, and is of interest in connection with
the statement by Bayiiss and Braprorp that the E.M.F. of the current of rest of
the skin of the Frog is reduced by treatment with atropine.

When the skin of an atropinised Eel is subjected to stimulation by means of the
break induction shock, it is found that the normal excitatory variation can no longer
be obtained, provided the atropinisation is sufficient.

The following experiment is illustrative of this fact.
