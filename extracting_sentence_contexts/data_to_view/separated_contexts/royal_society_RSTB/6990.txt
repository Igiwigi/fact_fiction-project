1. Many reasons support the view that the control was climatic. The fall in Alnus is too
big and too sudden for an anthropogenous effect: it might be conceived that this tree
suffered selective felling, for the wood is easy to work and is often found in Late Bronze Age
utensils, but in fact Alnus increased in amount after agriculture had begun (120 to 110 cm.),
and moreover there is so large a proportion of Alnus in the diagram that the amount of
disforestation needed to produce the observed drop in the Alnus pollen curve cannot be
envisaged. It might be suggested that Alnus was largely growing on the valley floors and
margins and that rise of the flood-waters killed it out, but although this may have been
true in part the proportion in which Alnus occurs at the base of the series makes it most
probable that this tree was a normal constituent of the forest, and that what we are here
concerned with was a shift in upland forest composition. 2.
