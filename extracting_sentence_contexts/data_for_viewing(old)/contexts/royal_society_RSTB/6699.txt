already been stated, the form of the pars occipitalis is so confused that the limits of
the ramus horizontalis and the sulcus’ parietalis transversus are not easy to define.

The grouping of the intraparietal sulcus is summarized in Table VIII, and is
compared with CUNNINGHAM’s grouping for the European and the Negro, and
with my own for the Southern Chinese.

These comparative tables are put in because CUNNINGHAM’s grouping has been
previously used as a basis for comparison. My own feeling is that the mere fact
of confluence or separation of sulci does not give sufficient information to warrant
the tables being taken too seriously. Moreover, in comparing brains which belong
to the same grouping in the Chinese and the Australian, I find that they look dis-
similar in many cases and from their general appearance are more similar to brains
in other groups. Having pointed out, however, the differences at the posterior end
of the fissure of Sylvius, having drawn the brains carefully, and having described the
salient features of the hemispheres, it is hoped that the above account may be of
use in comparing this very interesting series of parietal regions with those of other
races.
