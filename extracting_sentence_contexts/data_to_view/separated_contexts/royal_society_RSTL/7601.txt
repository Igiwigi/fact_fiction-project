I remark that my chief addition to
SALMON'S theory consists in a modification of his fundamental formulz (A) and (B) ;
these in their original form are

a(n—2)= x+ g+2%,
U(n—2)= e+2Þ+83y+3t,
e(n—2)=25+48+ 7,
a(n—2)(n—3)=2 +83[ac]+2[ab],
U(n—2)(n—3)=4k&+ [ab]+83[be],
e(n—2)(1—3)=6h+ [ac]+2[bc],
[ab]=ab—2z,
[ac]=ac—3s,
[be]J=be—3Þ—2y —7.
2. I take account of conical and biplanar nodes, or, as I call them, cnicnodes, and

binodes; of pinch-points* on the nodal curye; and of close-points and off-points on the
cuspidal curve: viz. I assnme that there are

where

C, cnicnodes,
B, binodes,
J. pinch-points,
%, close points,
5, off-points,
* This addition to the theory is in fact indicated in Sa1aox, 8ce the note, p. 445; the 7 there employed,
which is of course different from the 7 of his text, is the j of the present Memoir,

deferring for the present the explanation of these singularities. The ame letters,
accented, refer to the reciprocal singularities. Or using © trope ” as the reciprocal term

to node, these will be
C', cnictropes,

B', bitropes,
J' , pinch-planes,
x, close-planes,
9 , off-planes;
but these present themselves, not in the equations aboye referred to, but in the reciprocal
equations,
