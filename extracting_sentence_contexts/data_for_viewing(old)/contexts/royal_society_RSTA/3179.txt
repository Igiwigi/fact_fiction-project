(The generalized Markov problem): Given a natural integer n =1,2,..., (or +00), a commutative
associative real «-algebra xo with identity, a set T and a family {P(x, y) : x,y € T} of xo-valued n x n
transition probability matrices, determine under which conditions there exist:

(i) a commutative associative +-algebra « containing (an isomorphic copy of) ko and a a
Schwinger algebra A with centre «; |
(ii) for each x € T, a maximal abelian partition of the identity {Ag(x):=1,...,n} in A, such Dp
that, for each x,y¢T, the bi-stochastic matrix canonically associated with the pair : S
A(x), A(y) according to theorem 3.10 is P(x, y). =

Remark. The distinction between «9 and « in the above problem may seem a mathematical :8

pedantry. But in fact it has a deep probabilistic and physical meaning. This follows from the :&
paper [21] where the following very special case was considered: the set T contains only three :S
elements (observables A, B, C), n = 2 (the observables take only two values), and xo = R (the P(x, y)
(x,y € {A,B,C} are usual 2 x 2 bi-stochastic matrices). In the language of this paper, the result
of [21] is that only in very special cases (described in the paper) does the generalized Markov
problem for the family of bi-stochastic matrices {P(x,y) : x,y € {A, B, C}} have a solution with « =
R: the generic case requires « = C. In other words, the emergence of complex numbers in quantum
theory is a necessity, coded into the experimentally measurable transition probabilities and not an
arbitrary choice. In general, given a family of transition probability matrices P(x, y) with entries
in xo, if the generalized Markov problem for it has a positive solution, the centre of the associated
Schwinger algebra will be an abelian extension of ko. The fact that two families of transition
probability matrices with entries in «9 admit Schwinger algebra models with isomorphic centre
is an equivalence relation among such families and the common centre « can be considered as a
