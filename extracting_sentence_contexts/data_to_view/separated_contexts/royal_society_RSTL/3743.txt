The
first result, did follow ; upon taking out the stoppers the morning after the battery had
been charged, the liquid rose in the air-tube one-fifth of the gaseous volume. I now
closed it again and examined it three days afterwards ; a very curious effect had taken
place; the volume of the gas in the air tube which had previously contracted had
now increased, and it continued slowly increasing day after day. I at first believed
that the nitrogen was decomposed, but after many conjectures and experiments found
that the increase was due to the addition of hydrogen, a fact to me more extraor-
dinary than the decomposition of nitrogen would have been. Â© On repeating the ex-
periment with nitrogen instead of air the same effect took place, but of course without
the previous contraction. I 10w returned to battery fig.
