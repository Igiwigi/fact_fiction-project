that it will dissolve only 49,8 of carbonate of lime; I hence
infer that 100 of this carbonate is equivalent to go,2 carbo-
nate of lime, and consequently that 125.5 is the equivalent to
63 in the table.

Next, if I combine 125,5 of crystallized carbonate of potash
with an excess of muriatic acid, and evaporate to dryness, I
expel the whole of the water with all redundant acid, and
I find 93,2 of neutral salt; and whether I call it muriate of
potash, or chlorid of potassium, or by any other name, with
any other views, I may. deduct g4,1 as dry muriatic acid,
(whether real or imaginaryÂ®) and infer the equivalent for pot-
ash to be 59,1, even though there Should, in fact, be only 49,1
of potassium present, requiring 10+ of oxygen to convert it
into potash.

* Its separate existence is certainly imaginary, for it can no more be obtained un-
combined than dry sulphuric acid, or dry nitric acid.

+ Tf all the steps in the series, by which the number 49,1 is inferred, be correct,

this should be exactly 10,00 without any fraction ; and the proportion assigned to

muriate of potash by Berzerr1vs is sufficiently near, to shew that there can be no
considerable error, 83,02 ;' 16,58 :; 49,1: 10,04,
