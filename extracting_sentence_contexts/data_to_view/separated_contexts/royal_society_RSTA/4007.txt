Such differential actions may, however,
most probably be attributed to differences of electrical potential in the surfaces
involved. If we accept this view of the matter, then the diffusion across films of
eutectic becomes a case of electrolysis. Now, while diffusion in metals and alloys is
a proved fact, the possibility of electrolysis in an alloy has not yet been demonstrated
experimentally.* On the other hand, the close analogy with salt solutions leads one
to expect that alloys could be electrolysed, and those who have experimented in the
matter are not by any means certain that greater experimental resources will not
enable them to electrolyse alloys. There is at least one fact in the phenomena of re-crystallisation which the solution
theory, apart from electrolysis, does not cover, while the electrolytic theory explains
it very readily.
