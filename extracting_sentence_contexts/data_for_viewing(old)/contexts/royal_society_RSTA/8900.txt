dolerite shows the extremely low susceptibility 9x 10-*. This value is exceptionally
low for a doleritic rock, but it may be purely local and due to the particular form
taken by the iron-ores present in the rock (see p. 105). The figure will also be
brought below the normal because of the extent to which the rock is impregnated
with calcite. The figure should be compared with the higher values 391, 279, and
210x10- for the Whitwick, Kelham, and Southwell dolerites, and with 255 x 10-°
the average value determined for basaltic rocks by RéioKER and Wurrr.

(vi.) Intrusions being of quite local character, and often irregular in shape, are
more likely to cause sharp changes in the character of the magnetic disturbances
than sedimentary rocks occurring as horizontal or gently dipping sheets.

(vii.) Further, it is a well-known fact that in many areas the distribution of
intrusions is intimately related to the faulting, and there is evidence that similar
relationships hold in Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire, so that it is quite possible
that the intrusions really represent fault-intrusions. In such case the sharp nature
of the changes in the character of the disturbances between Rempstone and Lough-
borough, and again between Melton and Asfordby, might be readily explained.
The point will be further elaborated below.

4. Tur RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE FAULTS, THE INTRUSIONS, AND THE
Maenetic DistuRBANCES.

If it be granted that there is a strong probability that the origin of the magnetic
disturbances is to be looked for in dolerites associated with the buried Coal Measures,
