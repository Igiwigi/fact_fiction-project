In apology for the length of time taken over the work I must urge certain

unavoidable delays, of which the chief ones were due to the long exposures necessary
to obtain the weaker lines and the short lives of the vacuum tubes employed; as will
be explained below, these tubes will not withstand the long continued action of
the electric discharge and therefore they require to be frequently refilled. One of
the greatest delays arose from the fact that at one time the whole supply of xenon
was used up and it became necessary to prepare a further quantity to finish this
work. I take this opportunity of thanking Sir Witr1am Ramsay for his great
kindness in undertaking this for me.

The Rowland grating has a focal length of 10 feet and is ruled with 14,438 lines to
the inch ; all the measurements were made in the second and third orders, with the
exception of certain lines in the red region which were measured in the first order.
The spectra were photographed upon Lumrire’s plates, the extra rapid and the
A and B isochromatic series being used for the blue, green and red regions respectively.
These plates possess a great advantage over other makes which were tried in that
they give extremely well defined and fine grained images.
