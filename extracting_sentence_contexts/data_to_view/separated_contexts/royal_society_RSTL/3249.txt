the traveller may ride for many hundred miles over plains, scarcely broken by a
Single undulation, and where the strata and surface are almost absolutely level : no
one would there for one moment imagine that the elevatory forces had acted un-
equally, but rather he is astonished that the bottom of any sea or estuary should
have been 80 uniform, as must have been that of which the plains of La Plata not
long since formed the bed. Tf then great plains and mountainous countries can be raised within snch small
limits of absolute horizontality, as undoubtedly has happened in the above cases,
Shall we, who are wholly ignorant of the mechanism of these movements, be justified
in rejecting the plainest analogies, in supposing difficulties little short of physical im-
possIbilities, and in believing that the reverse of what is ascertained in other cases
has taken place in Lochaber, and all simply because the change of level has been

* I may here remark, that the equal elevation of the west coast of Scotland, and indeed of the whole British
Islands and other parts of Europe, may be inferred from the facts collected by Mr. Smrz in his paper in the
Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal. This author says (vol. xxv. p. 388.), ** The great terrace (known to

thirty and forty feet above the sea, forms a marked feature in the scenery of the west of Scotland.‚Äù
