With 65 of oxygen,
it becomes more fixed, like sulphuric acid; has a stronger
affinity for salifiable bases; and acquires more truly acid pro-
perties. Upon these considerations, I submit to the chemical
world, whether, in the present state of our knowledge, it be
not more philosophical to say,

Muriatic radical, or

some single word Muriatic acid ;

of thesameimport, pinstead of:

Muriatous acid, Oxygenized muriatic acid;
Auriatic acid, Hyperoxygenised muriatic acid. I am fully aware that, at first sight, this may appear extraor-
dinary; and the more 50, as we have no positive facts that
prove muriatic acid to be a simple body. All we can, therefore,
consider fairly, is, in favour of which appellation does the sum
of analogies scem to preponderate, And, to give the cause a
candid investigation, we should begin by considering, whether
the presence of oxygen in all bodies that have acid properties,
has been rigidly demonstrated; and not determine by this law
of the French chemistry, till we are well convinced it has not
been too generally assumed. If a nomenclature be not subservient to the uses of science,
and does not keep pace with its progress, the relation between


upon ozygenized and hyperozygenized muriatic Acid, &c. 167

substances and. their names will become 50 relaxed, that confu-
sion will be brought about, by the very means we take to avoid
it; and-if, while we continue to extend our acquaintance with
chemical bodies, nomenclature remains confined within its
former limits, the bonds that unite these two parts of the science
must inevitably be broken.
