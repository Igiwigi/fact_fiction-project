within desired size ranges. The grains produced in this way were almost spherical (cf. the
larger rounded particles in figure 3, plate 1).

(b) Initial experiments in absence of Calgon

In the first set of experiments proper, seed particles of various narrow size ranges were
used. The rates of addition of n/10-calcium chloride solution and n/10-sodium carbonate
solution remained constant at 3-6 and 4-2 ml./min. respectively. It was found that if more
than a critical quantity of grains was present no visible nucleation occurred. The overflow
remained quite clear. The critical quantity depended on the grain size and over the range
examined was in fact connected with seed diameter by a relation which was practically
linear (table 1).
