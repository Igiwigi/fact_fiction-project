where we have used the fact that as LF; is a symplectic integrator, it is volume preserving and thus
Ue, (2, p)| =1, and that N(py;0, MN (P41; hpe, (1 — H2)M) = N(pr4.1i0, MN (prs hip, (1 — H2)M). As
for ULA, it is possible to easily reparameterize the proposal in terms of standard Gaussian random
variables. This leads to low-variance estimates of the gradients of the ELBO. Doucet et al. [38]


provides an empirical comparison of UHA-type and ULA-type proposals in a limited Monte
Carlo experiment. The performance is slightly better for UHA than for ULA, but the difference
is rather small. This finding is somewhat consistent with the results of Bou-Rabee & Eberle [37],
which show that the mixing time of UHA is better than that of ULA. However, we are far from
having a clear theoretical guarantee of the relative advantage of using UHA compared with ULA
in the context of AIS, which is very complex.
