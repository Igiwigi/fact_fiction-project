specimen, which enabled me to examine it anatomically, and also to thank him for advice concerning the
identity of the specimen in question. Dr. Starr, who kindly examined my sections, does not consider it
likely that the Fiji specimen is specifically identical with Acmopyle Pancheri, but he agrees to the generic
identity.

+ Lam also much indebted to this lady, who has an intimate knowledge of the flora of Fiji, for her
kind advice on the above question.


AFFINITIES OF ACMOPYLE PANCHERI, PILGER. 257

diameter ; several of them had proliferated, having continued their growth distally
into normal rootlets (Plate 9, fig. 2), a fact which supports Van TreGuemâ€™s view (1889,
p. 352) that the tubercles are modified rootlets. In some material collected at a later
date no tubercles were present; this may be due to all the tubercles having grown
out into normal rootlets.

The stele of the tubercle, like that of the root, is diarch, and lies in the same plane,
at least at its point of origin. Root-hairs were altogether absent in my material,
both on the root and tubercles.

In the root the cells of the inner cortex show pronounced local thickenings which, in
the form of hoops, girdle the cells in different planes. Similar thickenings have been
described by NorLte (1910) in the Araucarinese, Taxodineee and Cupressinese. In
section (Plate 9, fig. 3) these thickenings appear like beads, and turn yellow in
