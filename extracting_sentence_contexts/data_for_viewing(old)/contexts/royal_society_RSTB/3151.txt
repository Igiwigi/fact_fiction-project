IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND REGENERATION OF BONE. 255

planted and seven weeks after there was not only no bone production from either
transplant, but the periosteum had become absorbed.

DuHAMEL’s Stnver Ring Experiments.

Douuamet placed (1739) a silver ring under the periosteum in a living animal and
found, some time after, that the ring had become covered by bone. He inferred from
this that the periosteum secreted bone. This experiment is often quoted as a proof
of the osteogenic power of the periosteum,

There is no doubt about the fact that when a metallic ring which closely fits the
shaft of a growing bone is placed under the periosteum, new bone will in course
of time surround the ring. The deduction drawn therefrom, that the periosteum
must, therefore, be the source of the new bone, does not necessarily follow. Irritation
of a bone excites proliferation of the bone cells and the osteoblasts are poured out
from the Haversian Canals on to the surface of the bone and fill the interstices of the
soft tissues surrounding the shaft, such as the loose areolar tissue existing between
the bone and the periosteum. In this way, layers of new bone emanating from the
bone itself are deposited peripherally and may soon cover a foreign body of limited
size surrounding the bone or lying on its surface.

If this be so, would bone, denuded of its periosteum, be capable of throwing out
sufficient ossific matter to clothe a metallic ring placed upon its surface ¢
