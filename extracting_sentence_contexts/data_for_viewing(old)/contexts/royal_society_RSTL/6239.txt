and thence, observing also that o+7/ =>
w0(=ofofsfoffo')=52*f— 5al*e+b*+90'r7,
or as this equation may also be written,

4a0=(Sac—20) —ba(r—r')*;

and hence the Resolvent Product 0(=fwfsfo*fa') being determined by an equation of
the sixth order, this is also the case with the function (7—7'P. |

5. But the twelve functions +(7—7') can be divided into two ets of six functions each,
$0 that each set is determined by an equation of the sixth order involving a single qua-
dratic radical. This was in fact suggested to me by Mr. HarLEy's equation in #; for in
the case considered 7+? was =0, or 2?=t—t', and the equation in # was presumably the
particular form of the equation for 4(#—?7') in the general case. But it will presently
appear in what manner the conclusion should have been arrived at & prior.

6. The preceding remarks show the connexion between the function @(=r—r7) to
which belongs the new auxiliary equation, and the Resolvent Product 0(=fwfa"fo*fo').
The relation was given for the denumerate form of the quintic; but taking, instead, the
standard form (, b, c, d, e, fv, 1)*=0, it becomes

400=2500{ac—*—5d'pt.

7. The foregoing equation shows that & is a seminyariantive function of the roots. In
