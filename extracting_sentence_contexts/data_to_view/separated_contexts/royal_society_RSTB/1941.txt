The associa-
tion of the two forms, i.¢., the growth of a prothallus, capable of assuming the
cylindrical form and producing sporangia, from the zygote, has never been seen, and
it would be, perhaps, too much to expect that further experiments may produce it. It cannot be too strongly insisted upon that the above is put forward merely as a
rovisional hypothesis which serves to connect together a group of facts, the further
Evetady of which must modify, and will possibly disprove it. It may, however, be used
Gas the basis of a comparison with the antithetic theory to ascertain which facts are
2 best explained by the one and which follow most naturally from the other theoretical
E view. This will be done under the following heads :—

” (1.) Alternation in Bryophyta and some Algze.

2 (2.) Normal life-history of Pteridophyta.

< (8.) Abnormal modes of reproduction in Bryophyta and Pteridophyta.

8 (4.) Cytological distinctions between the sexual and asexual generations.

3 (1.) Alternation in Bryophyta and some Alga.

5 These groups agree in that the second generation appears as a group of spores or
‘Sas a more or less complex fruit. They may be conveniently referred to together
4 without implying a necessary genetic connection between the forms compared.
