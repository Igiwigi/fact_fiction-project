They, he enumerates all the Conjupations of

cauſe, why, in all the Perturbations of the Soul, the Fyes, the Face
and the Mouth ir ſelf, do ſo' exactly anſwer th: AteQions of the
Heart, .as if they were all ſtruck with the ſame p/eri or quill ; as

motion , explaining the manner how it is performd ; and endea-
vouring to ſolve the difficulties occurring therein : where he examins,
both what Der-Carte hath deviſed on this ſubje& by aſſigning a di-
rection to. the wagging /4ndu/a pirealis ; and what Gaſſenais and. Dr. Willis have ſuggelted onthe ſame, by the flammeons motion or explo-
ſion of the Spirits ; the former ſeeming co him altogether fictitious
(bow ingenious ſoever 3) the latter leaving ic hardly conceivable
to him, how ſo conſtant-and even a motion of the Muſcles in a ſound
body can proceed from ſo violent a cauſe ; nor how the Soul would
be able to keep ſuch a command over her motions, if they did depend
from an Accenſion of the Spirits or a violent Exploſion. Mean
time, he finds it very difficult to make it out, what it is indeed, that
cauſeth the Motion of the Muſcles; yet conceives at laſt, that *tis
the ContraRion of their fibres, that produces it 3 but whether that
be done by the acceſſion of ſome ſubſtance, orby a change of angles
inthe fibres, is a new difficulty, which the Learned Sreno ſcruples to
determineany thingin, though Dr. zi/ls declare for the former Opl-

knownto us in the Motion of the Muſcles. Which done, he con-
cludes the whole with his ingenious Conſiderations about the Motion

of Walking, Flying, Swimming , Creeping. &c; annexing thereto
his doctrine of Paſlions,
