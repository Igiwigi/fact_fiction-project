fluid at cestrus, are provided by two similar non-parous squirrels, No. 275 taken in May
and No. 87 taken in June, figs. 12 and 15, Plates 10 and 11. No. 275 had a uterus
weight of 0-73 gm. ; its largest follicle had a diameter of 0-78 mm. while that of No. 87
was 0-86 mm. Comparison with No. 213 shows a further increase in the height and
volume of the epithelium ; folds of it now project into the lumen and the cells reach a
height of 50 »; their oval nuclei still lie near the base, leaving in section a deep border
of light cytoplasm next the lumen. The gland cells are similar and have a height of
15 u. The coiled, obliquely running gland tubules reach far into the stroma ; secretion
can be seen in the uterine lumen but it is not very abundant.

The cestrous uterus obtained from No. 283, shot just after mating, weighed 1-1 gm. ;
it contained spermatozoa and was distended with fluid so that the wall was far thinner
than in the preceding specimens. (Fig. 13, Plate 10.) Owing to the fact that it was
not fixed till 15 hours after death a detailed histological description is not possible.
The distended epithelium is not quite so high as in No. 87, but it averages about
40 » (assuming it to be unaffected by post-mortem changes). The epithelial cells
seem to be actively secreting.

(d) Changes before Implantation—Fig. 16, Plate 11, shows the appearance of the
uterine mucosa associated with the youngest corpus luteum of the series, that of No. 73
illustrated in fig. 7, Plate 9. This was probably 1-2 days after ovulation. The uterus
of No. 73 weighed 0-78 gm. ; there were no external signs of implantation. Fig. 16,
Plate 11, shows how the uterine endometrium has proliferated and grown into a
series of folds deeper and more regular than those found just before cestrus. The actual
epithelial cells show a decrease in height to 25-30 » ; the glands have also proliferated
