Those prepared with weaker solutions and in bottles, are frequently
more amethystine or ruby in colour and apparently clear. The latter, when in their
tinest state, often remain unchanged for many months, and have all the appearance of
Solutions. But they never are such, containing in fact no dissolved, but only diffused
gold. The particles are easily rendered evident, by gathering the rays of the swn (ora
lamp) into a cone by a lens, and sending the part of the cone near the focus into the
finid; the cone becomes visible, and though the illuminated particles cannot be distin-
guished because of their minuteness, yet the light they reflect is golden in character,
and een to be abundant in proportion to the quantity of solid gold present. Portions
of fluid 80 dilute as to show no trace of gold, by colour or appearance, can have the pre-
sence of the diffused solid particles rendered evident by the sun in this way.
