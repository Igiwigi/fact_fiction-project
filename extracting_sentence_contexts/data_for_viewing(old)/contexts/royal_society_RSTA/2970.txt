range is indeed a reasonable one.

The range to the left of what is shown in figure 5 is problematic, because close enough to the
limit of vanishing impact velocity, the saddle point of the averaged Hamiltonian becomes very
flat, on the verge of turning into a local maximum. This renders the corresponding generalized
LPT extremely flat and the corresponding energy exchange extremely slow. Consequently,
one has to wait extremely long times for delocalization to occur, and therefore only for
higher coupling values one immediately observes the delocalization. Therefore, if judging by
reasonable computational time length results, it may appear as if the averaging-based approach
underestimates the critical coupling values. The range to the right of what is shown in figure 5
is problematic for another reason. For high-enough energy it is suggested by numerical analysis
that the full system undergoes delocalization for lower coupling values than predicted by the
averaging-based approach. The reason for this may be attributed to the fact that for high energies
the system is highly nonlinear and higher resonances than the 1:1 resonance assumed to occur
may come into play. Moreover, there may be resonance overlap. Clearly, if this happens for higher
coupling than predicted by averaging, it is irrelevant to the onset of delocalization. If, however, it
occurs for lower coupling values than predicted by assuming 1:1 resonance, then delocalization
in the full system would occur for lower coupling values than predicted.

In the case analysed in [49], this latter phenomenon did not occur. The reason is that when
the system is rigorously foundation-free, the energy can be renormalized, such that the value of
the energy has no influence on the dynamics and there is no high-energy regime with its possible
complex resonance overlap.
