A great portion of the C and of
that part of the B which arose from horizontal force thus become dispelled. The symmetry which gives C its character ceases the moment the ship heels. An
addition is then made to C proportional to the angle of heel, and this addition consists
in fact of two parts, corresponding to the two parts of B which, as we have seen, do not
exist, in the original C, viz. a part consisting of transient magnetism induced by the
vertical force, and a part consisting of subpermanent magnetism induced by the same
force. These will be more conyeniently considered when we come to discuss the heel-
ing error,

'The semicircular deviation may be put under the form 4/B*+C*sin (£'+e), in which
VS B*+C represents the maximum of semicircular deviation, « (tana= 8) the angle to
the right of the ship's head of the force causing this deviation ; for convenience, these

two quantities are tabulated in the eleventh and thirteenth columns.
