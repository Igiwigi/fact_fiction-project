Ss Salts I. and II. were made from the acid obtained from the action of hydrochloric
Scid, and III. from that obtained by the action of hydriodic acid. Z It therefore appears that methyl-noropianic acid is monobasic. The fact that opi-
Zanic acid when heated with excess of strong caustic potash splits up into meconin and
Zhemipinic acid, leads us to hope that methyl-noropianic acid would with the same reagent
Zundergo a similar decomposition. It was, however, found that the acid remains unal-
Aered; for after treating it with strong caustic potash, a silyer-salt was made, which
Sviclded on ignition 39:5 per cent. silyer, methyl-noropianate of silver requiring 35:64
per cent.
5 The reduction of opianic acid to meconin by the action of sodium-amalgam caused
Jus to try this reagent on the new acid, but here again we could not produce the corre-
Esponding reduction.
65 When methyl-noropianic acid is dissolved in cold water, and about a sixth of its volume
Sof strong nitric acid added, an action immediately sets up, and the solution becomes
Sdark from nitric oxide and afterwards again light, when a nitro-acid erystallizes out. ATo prevent the action going on too far the solution must be kept cold.
