how quantum phenomena come about is, to return to Bohr’s locution, ‘in principle excluded’ [12,
vol. 2, p. 63]. As indicated above, the situation on this score is far less clear in biology, psychology
or economics, where such connections would be molecular in the first case, neurological or
psychological in the second, and psychological, sociological, political or economic in the third.
Indeed, while still entertaining in principle a similar argument, Bohr, too, was even more tentative
regarding psychology than he was regarding biology [2, pp. 158-166].

A recent article by E. Haven and A. Khrennikov provides an intriguing example of a possible
role of quantum-like discreteness in market economics [55].5 A phenomenon of quantum
tunnelling occurs when a particle tunnels through a barrier that it would not be able to surmount
if it behaved classically and is thus a quantum phenomenon par excellence. The process itself
cannot be observed. (In the present view, no quantum process could be.) We only deal with
observable effects of this process, specifically with the fact that there is a non-zero probability that

4 Arguments for such connections have been advanced, prominently by R. Penrose, from his first major work on the subject
[54] on. While Penrose’s theory primarily concerns the neurobiology of the brain and consciousness, Penrose also links his
argument to the possibility that life itself is a quantum effect.

a particle can be found beyond the barrier, which is to say that the corresponding measurement
will register an impact of this particle on the measuring instrument beyond the barrier. Thus,
we deal with two discrete phenomena, relatable only by probabilistic predictions concerning
the second on the basis of the first, in the absence, at least in the present interpretation, of any
