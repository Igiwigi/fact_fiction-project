no effect was produced. Hence he concluded that “the anterior nerve would seem to be mixed, but the
posterior nerve purely sensory.” This result was due to the fact that, in his experi-
ments, the animal was fixed in such a position that it was impossible to observe any
contraction of the extensor muscles. If, however, the animal be placed in such a
position that the extensor muscles can be observed while the posterior nerve is being
stimulated near the ganglion, and therefore on the ventral aspect of the body, a
marked tetanus of the extensor muscles is found to follow stimulation. (5.)
