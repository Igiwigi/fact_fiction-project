EE: The best mode of investigating these organs! is to dissolve the shell, and then they
zmre exposed, in various stages of growth, adhering to the margin of the mantle. They
Zure arranged in rows, and are cylindrical, with the distal extremity obtusely rounded,
Sand are pedunculated from the first ; the peduncle is long and narrow ; the cca at the
xtreme edge are small, but rapidly increase in size backward; the terminal or enlarged
-Sportion is almost constantly stuffed full with the 80-called blood-corpuscles. When
Sobserved in this way, these organs have very much the character of secerning follicles,
Shut what function they really subserve is difficult to determine; it may be that they
Shave something to do with the growth and reparation of the shell, though it is not easy
Eto understand how. They are probably, as suggested by Professor HuxLey?, the homo-
logical representatives of the vascular processes that penetrate the test of the Ascidian ;
Â£Zand if 80, it would seem likely that they have lost much of their functional importance ;
Vand in fact their entire absence in forms closely allied to those in which they are highly
Sdeveloped, augurs that they are not of any high functional signification. It may there-
Efore be here, as it is in the Ascidic, that they maintain a vitality in the external cover-
King or shell; low, indeed, in comparison to that of the test of the latter, but sufficient.
perhaps, to repair the shell should it be fractured; and as the Brachiopods do not, to
any great, extent, thicken their shells by successive internal layers, 80me Such provision
appears necessary for the purpose.
The reticulated membrane, which is closely adherent to the homogeneous layer bene;
and in which the czeca originate, has very much the character of an epithelial layer. It
is therefore not unlikely that they may be productions merely of the epithelium.
