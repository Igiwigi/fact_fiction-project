As for the deployment of the Argo array, the number of joint T and S profiles
has begun to exceed those of temperature alone. Kindly provided by Simon Good, Crown Copyright. (Online version in colour.)

(b) Initialized predictions

Idealized model experiments are useful tools for understanding mechanisms of variability,
assessing potential predictability and suggesting which are the key ocean observations. However,
such studies are always limited by the fidelity of the climate model(s) being used and also by the
fact that the real world has both internal and external forcings (e.g. volcanoes or anthropogenic
industrial emissions). Real-world decadal predictions have emerged in the last few years, with one of the first being
the Met Office Decadal Prediction System (DePreSys) [44]. Such predictions use a climate model
that has been initialized from a best estimate of the state of the ocean and atmosphere and then run
forwards in time with projected changes in the anthropogenic emissions (e.g. greenhouse gases
(GHGs) and aerosols) included.
