Further, formulae for the covariance of average pairwise .
difference terms can also be reduced to functions of individ- (b) Covariance
ual pairwise terms Let i, i’, j, j' be four individuals sampled from arbitrary

populations. Let T be a local coalescent tree relating the
four individuals restricted to a non-recombining region.
Here, we show that

Cov(dx, dy) = Cov(kii, kj). (2.7)

This simple result is due to the fact that the covariance of

sums can be decomposed into the sums of covariances. Cov(kiz, kIT) = mtirnjy- (3.5)
As presented in Takahata & Nei (equations 18a-d) [7], — —
covariance equations involving the cross population can be Consequently, we further derive the unconditional quantity
expressed as follows: Cov (kin, kip) = wE(tieniy) + 4u2Cov( tii, tins (3.6)

Cov(dxy, dy) = 2 E(k jy kij) + ny —2 E(kjp ki) To prove these results, we start by revisiting the idea that
