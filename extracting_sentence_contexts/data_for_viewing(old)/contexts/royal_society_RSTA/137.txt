maximizing the schedulable region, and minimizing network cost. In fact, some
current P2P applications already implement variants of these controllers. Such
controllers can work with current TCP; however, the RTT bias inherent in TCP
can lead to network inefficiencies.

The use of flexible routing combined with smart congestion controllers can
overcome many of the current architectural limitations of the current Internet.
The one application type that is not completely accommodated in this framework
is real-time streaming or real-time applications in general. Firstly, the suitability
of utility maximizing allocations for real-time flows is not as clear as for elastic

raffic, although one possible integration is described in Key et al. (2004).
Secondly, it is not possible to give a hard QoS guarantees over a best-effort
