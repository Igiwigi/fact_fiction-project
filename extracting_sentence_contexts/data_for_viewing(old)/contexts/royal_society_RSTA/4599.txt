A=-—wU"/U'. A further implication of A > 0 is that, if we have fixed total wealth, W, that we wish : s
to consume over two periods—c) in period 1 and cz = W — cy in period 2—then welfare, W, is : 2
maximized if cy = cz = W/2. Smoothing spending patterns over time is always preferred by a risk 2

averse individual. The negative third derivative captures what economists call the ‘precautionary
savings motive’, which was originally described by [49]. The stronger this motive is, as measured
by absolute prudence, P = —U’”/U" > 0 [50], the more we will save today against potentially bad
outcomes given a future risky income stream. This feature of utility functions is used to explain, :
among other observed phenomena, why household savings go up and interest rates go down =
before periods of high unemployment. 13
The primary variable of interest is E,_3[W], the welfare that the agent currently expects to enjoy
in the future. Specifically, how greatly do scientific advances in the interval f € [1 — 5,1] increase nee)
E,~s[¥] despite the fact that the signal neither enables the agent to reduce GHG emissions nor :
directly protect the agent from the economic consequences of climate change? A second variable [4
of interest is E,_s[c,]. Under what circumstances will a signal lead to an increase in the expected DN
consumption level the next instant? Deriving answers to these two questions under a variety of [G
circumstances is the principal goal of our model. If
To begin, we compare the case of a full signal (eg = 1 — p, eg = p) to that of no signal (eg = eg = .
0); we relax these assumptions to obtain Result 2 and in our numerical illustrations. In the simpler
case:

Result 1. If we receive a full signal in the interval [1 — 6,1], then compared with the case of
receiving no signal:

1.1. Expected welfare, E,_3[W], increases.
