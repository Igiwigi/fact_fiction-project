are such pooling equilibria.

It might also cost the receiver something to listen. Let us
combine this with a costly message and unequal state
probabilities. For example, let the probability of state 1
be 1/3, the cost of signal 1 0.3 and the cost of the
receiver paying attention to the signals 0.1. The
background fitness is 1. Then, the foregoing pay-off
matrix changes to that displayed in table 2. 5. SIGNALLING NETWORKS
