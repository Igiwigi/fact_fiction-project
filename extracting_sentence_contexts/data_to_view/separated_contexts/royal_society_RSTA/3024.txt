The fourteen readings obtained from it indicated that the linear
relation would be satisfied at that pressure if they were substituted for the readings
given by photograph D19. On both the photographs at 25 atmospheres the comparison spectrum was in the
central strip, and as the precautions that had been taken (p. 129) seemed to preclude . the possibility of an undiscovered fictitious shift, it was decided to investigate the
phenomenon carefully, and to repeat the whole series of photographs. The photographs of the second set, B, give results more consistent with a linear
connection between the pressure and the displacement (Diagrams IT., IV., VI.), except
in the case of Group III., where the displacements at 20 atmospheres are again too
high, though the readings given by Groups I. and II. agree well with those obtained
at higher pressures in making the function a linear one. At 5 atmospheres most of the lines of Groups I., Set A, as well as most of the lines

of Set B, at 3 and 4 atmospheres, show too great a value for the linear relation to
hold, and in this region the curves are not accurately directed to the origin ; but too
much stress must not be placed upon the measurements at these pressures, because
the percentage error in the measurement of a shift is greater at low than at high
pressures, since in the former the shift of the line is but a fraction of its own width.
