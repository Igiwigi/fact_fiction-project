not yet reached their asymptotic shape as a function of time. The class of states considered here DNS
is depicted in figure 2a. It has to be contrasted with the asymptotic states used in reference [52] area
as initial conditions, which always lead to a unique outcome. In figure 1, we give an overview [3
of the types of behaviour as a function of the approach velocity v and the destabilizing real part .
of the cross-coupling c;. The range covered in the plot is 0.1 < v <0.7 and 0.1 <c; < 0.6. For v
sufficiently large and cy sufficiently small interpenetration is obtained with the final quasi-one-
dimensional states reaching in size and shape their asymptotic behaviour. For v sufficiently small
and c; sufficiently large, we obtain non-unique results as the outcome of the collisions, whereas in
the range in between these two limiting cases the result of collisions of two quasi-one-dimensional
states is one compound state.

The possibility of anon-unique outcome as a result of collisions is intrinsically connected to the
fact that the initial conditions used were not in the quasi-one-dimensional asymptotic state. That
non-unique results might arise for non-asymptotic initial conditions has been briefly indicated
in reference [52], where we used initial conditions for which the quasi-one-dimensional states
were closer together (compare fig. 5a of [52]). The parts of figure 1 showing interpenetration and
one compound state resemble closely those described in reference [52], but are slightly shifted to
larger values of cy.

To investigate the non-uniqueness in detail, we use series of snapshots, space time plots taken
for a line along the crest of one of the initial quasi-one-dimensional states and three-dimensional
plots of the asymptotic final states.

Figure 2 shows an example of the time evolution from an initial state of the class considered
here (figure 2a) to one of the possible final states for these parameter values (cy = 0.6 and v = 0.5).
