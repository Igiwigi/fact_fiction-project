Here, we have to treat the gradient terms non-perturbatively, since we expect that they have the
same magnitude as the uniform terms. Combining pairs of equation in each line we eliminate &

Using the fact that the unperturbed solution is uniform, VR&o = 0, we can use the second equation
to eliminate $1 from the first,

Substituting unitarity condition AyAo = —|Ao|?, and expressions for 80,fo, one derives final

equation for corrections to the propagator, linear in OP deviations,
