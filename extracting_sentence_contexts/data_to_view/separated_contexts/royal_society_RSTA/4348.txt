Energy efficiency is essential for moving forward. The
end to historical scaling in optical systems, the fibre capacity crunch, is bringing about a shift
to growth through parallelism, which can only be supported through exponential improvements
in energy efficiency. In fact, multiple Internet technologies, having undergone similar growth,
are facing related scaling challenges, including electrical interconnects and mobile systems. Improving the energy efficiency of optics can enable the use of optics in these energy-constrained
network edges. Efficiency gains in electronics will further benefit optical systems creating
synergistic gains and open energy and cost-sensitive applications to optical technologies.
