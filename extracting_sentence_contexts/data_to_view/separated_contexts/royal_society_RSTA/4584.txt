No. 9 shows the general rise of Jevel due to the entry of the sphere. The rise at the
edge of the scale is aboutâ€™3 millims., but the rise at the spout of the vessel is much
more marked, though this is at a greater distance from the place of impact, and the
liquid enveloping the sphere seems to rise very abruptly out of the flat surface on
this side. We think that all the facts point to rise of Jevel at great distances from
the impact even when the vessel is much wider. When the ivory sphere, which when dry and well polished gave the splash of
Series IV., was allowed to fall wet into the liquid, all other circumstances remaining
the same, the splash of Series VII. (Plate 7) was obtained, which from the very
first is entirely different.
