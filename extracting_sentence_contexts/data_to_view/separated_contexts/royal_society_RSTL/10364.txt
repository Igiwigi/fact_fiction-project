(See Table LXIX., pp. 1332-3.) = Tt will be seen that the effect of the manure was, as already said, upon the whole,
xtremely meagre. In fact, there was scarcely any increased luxuriance induced ; and
Such increase in produce as there was, was mainly due to an increased tendency to
Stem-formation and consolidation of tissue in the case of some 8pecies. There was
dhus but little artificial struggle induced, and we have an average of 47 species as
-Zompared with 49 without manure. Both the percentage in the total herbage, and the
Zetual quantity per acre, of the total Graminez rather declined, whilst those of the
eguminosz rather increased ; and the percentage, but not the actual quantity, of the
-Mniscellaneous herbage also showed some tendency to increase.
