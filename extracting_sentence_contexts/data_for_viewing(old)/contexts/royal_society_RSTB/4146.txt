periods, over that which occurs in the resting muscle.

Whichever of these methods we tried we found that we had no certain base line
from which to work. It may here be well to anticipate what we are going to say
later’so far as to state two facts—

(1) That in common with all other observers we have found that the coefficient of
oxidation in resting muscle is very different in different muscles ; and

(2) That the increased oxidation caused by fifteen minutes’ stimulation such as we
have given may last for several hours, perhaps four or five.

Taking these facts together it seems quite probable that the oxidation which
observers have been accustomed to regard as that of resting muscle is largely the
after-effect of previous contractions, and in order to make any just estimate of

whether the muscle was a fit subject for estimation of the kind, one would have to
know its history for some hours before the experiment took place:

To turn now to the facts which have led to the above conclusions. CHAUVEAU
and KAurFMANN obtained figures varying from 0°0082 to 00029 c.c. per gramme per
minute in three experiments; Verzir, in 11 experiments, gives figures from
