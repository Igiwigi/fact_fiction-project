innumerable minor planes of separation at all conceivable angles to each other in both
rocks; and yet we have highly elastic and dense materials forming the substance of both
rocks, and their general mass remarkably free from open veins, fissures, or cavities.

We have also two different rocks, the one transmitting the impulse into the other,

ters as to make any great or abrupt effect upon the wave at the junction probable,
In fact, widely to the first glance as the quartz rock and the schist rock appear to
differ, there is less real distinction of physical character between them than would be
supposed: both are composed of the same siliceous, sand, in about the same size of
original grains, yariously enveloped, in the one in chlorite and mica, and in the other
in white or grey clay and mica; both have, in ancient geological epochs, doubtless
derived their materials by degradation and transport from a common $0urce as respects
their main constituent, the silex; both have been snbmitted to approximately similar
pressures, and probably like temperatures ; and the agglutinating flux has probably
been mainly the same for both, viz. the minute proportions of alkalies derived from the
