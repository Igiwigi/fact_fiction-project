As often unrecognized in the field of wind energy, load :<
control and vibration control are two faces of the same coin. Hence, vibration control strategies : s
could be considered as an alternative effective means to achieve the identical aim of control of : g

structural vibrations and fatigue-related damage in the same way that pitch control would do
by load control. In fact, vibration control strategies would not have the drawback of interference
with torque control or stresses generated by pitching the blades. Although structural vibration
control has been an active area of research for the past two decades, developing structural control
strategies and applying those to wind turbines is a relatively new field of research. The primary modes of vibration of wind turbine blades are in-plane (primarily edgewise) and : =
out-of-plane (primarily flapwise).
