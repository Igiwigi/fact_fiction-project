It will thus be seen that the hallux is represented in primary movement in a very
large proportion of the centres which are relegated to the movements of the lower
limb, in fact it occurs primarily in the proportion of over 50 per cent. While noting
that the hallux is represented as a primary movement to such a degree, it is important
to remember that its chief region of primary representation is close around the upper
end of the fissure of Rotanvo. This latter generalisation not only assumes special
importance in connection with the diagnosis of the seat of disturbance in an epilepti-
form convulsion beginning in the hallux, but also because it points to the fact, upon
which stress will later be laid, that this part is the focal region of the representation
of the lower limb. A total number of 82 primary movements of the hallux were
observed. Ill.
