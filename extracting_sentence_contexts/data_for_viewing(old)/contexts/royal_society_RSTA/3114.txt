for Maxwell molecules. The computation for hard spheres is easier to do via the chain rule

Thus in both the cases of Maxwell molecules and hard spheres, we see u is decreasing for [=
increasing r consistent with the video. 8
The reader may ask what if we had used Maxwell’s formula for the shear stress which, in fact,
is quite similar to the one obtained from the Burnett truncation. This shear stress does possess a aoa)
capillarity-like term, but the constant A given by Maxwell is negative and hence the gas would fo
move in the wrong direction. This again reinforces the failure of the Burnett truncation. a]

5. Further remarks on the relevance of Korteweg's theory fg

In this section, I will comment on some recent papers on the role of Korteweg’s theory in gas
dynamics. The first paper [47] is a rigorous derivation of the Korteweg stress term directly
from the Boltzmann equation without recourse to the Chapman-Enskog expansion. The authors
use a diffusion scaling of the Boltzmann equation and a macro-micro decomposition of the
Boltzmann probability distribution function f to resolve the flow of a gas with different prescribed
temperature values at x = too. Of course, just as in the problems of the radiometer and the flow
