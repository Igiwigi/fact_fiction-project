Tl. From », g = 36200420. From D,, (2), ¢g = 361°913+°6, but with somewhat
doubtful theory. Value adopted, 362°00 +'20.

These values for the 17 elements weighted according to the possible errors now
give gq = 361°890. This is the same as our first approximate value, but its probable
error is much less. If the determination of the value depended only on questions of
errors of calculation and of observation in spectral and atomic weight data, the above
number would probably be extremely close to the actual one. It must be remem-
bered, however, that our theory of the constitution is not yet complete. For
instance, in [IL] it was seen that the supposition that N was not constant for the
p-sequence, but that the value for the first line was slightly larger explained the
introduction of a term in the denominator. A similar explanation might explain the
fact that the value of q appears to deviate from the mean by about the same amount
in each group of elements, and if it were justified, the value of q calculated as above
would receive a slight modification. I believe it will be found ultimately that the
true value will lie within the limits given by 361°890+°05 or 90°4725+°0125.

If the existence of the oun as a definite proportion of the (atomic weight)’ be
considered as: established, the best and most direct method of determining the value
of the factor g would be from the discussion of an element in which the spectroscopic
data are good and in which the atomic weight has been determined with great
accuracy. For this purpose we naturally turn to silver. Regarded as the ultimate
standard of atomic weight determinations, no error in the atomic weight enters—the
value of g is determined in terms of W = 107°88. Moreover its separation is large,
so that any error of measurement is a small fraction of its total value, and in addition
