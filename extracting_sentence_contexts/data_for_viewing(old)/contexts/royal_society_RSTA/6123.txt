scale in state-of-the-art foundries and are present in the central processing units, memory and
other components of devices such as smartphones all over the world. The technique behind this
is of course photolithography, which has stretched the limits of the Rayleigh criterion (equation
(1.1)). Computational photolithography methods such as phase-shift photomasks and optical
proximity correction [77] take advantage of diffraction to go smaller than the criterion would


suggest. This staggering miniaturization has been possible in part due to the almost atomic
flatness, crystallinity and purity of substrates like silicon, gallium arsenide, sapphire and others.
In this aspect, polymer films will never be able to quite reach the same limits due to a lack of
crystallinity, the larger size of the polymer fibres and movement of the fibres during flexing.
There is still however—to quote the now cliché from Richard Feynman—plenty of room at
the bottom [78]. The fact that a technique as simple as spin-coating can be used to produce
homogeneous films with values of rms surface roughness of less than 1nm [53] bodes well
for further miniaturization into the nano-regime. The solution processability means that very
large-scale integration (VSLI) is possible if applications are widely adopted. Providing that
whatever flexing required is consistent, the design, materials and fabrication protocols can be
optimized appropriately, allowing for further miniaturization. Although this work has focussed
on metals—as their high conductivity lends itself well to micro- and nanoscale electronics—
modern conductive polymers which can flex with the substrate may have a role to play instead
but must have low enough impedance for devices to be efficient and prevent heating and device
or tissue damage [4].

Integration with external components such as power sources, resistors, transistors, diodes and
so on is perhaps the greatest challenge due to the mismatch between properties, and their size.
