Example 3.5. If g is the empty tuple, n > 2 and x is an n-tuple where all components are trivial,
then it follows immediately from the definition that (x, @) is not Kummer-induced. Thus, the last
result recovers, for p large enough in terms of n, the fact that the geometric monodromy group of
Ke, contains SL, if n is odd, and contains either SO, or Sp,, if 1 is even. In order to apply the results of the previous section, it is of course very useful to have some
information concerning the projective automorphism groups of hypergeometric sheaves. Many
cases are contained in the following result.
