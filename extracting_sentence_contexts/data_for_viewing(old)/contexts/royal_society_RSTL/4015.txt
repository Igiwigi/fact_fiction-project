capsule is perforated by branches of the vessels and duct which are distributed in its
interior, This arrangement of separate lobules would permit a considerable amount
of movement upon each other, whilst the capsule would have the effect of preventing
undue engorgement and distension of each individual lobule, a provision which
seems to be especially needed in the pig.

'There is not this division into distinct and separate lobules in the livers of other
animals which I have examined. As numerous authors have described, there is a
sort of mapping out of small spaces produced by the arrangement of the smallest
vessels and ducts, to be seen more or less distinctly in the livers of all vertebrate
animals ; but it is impossible to separate these apparently isolated portions from
each other, without tearing the hepatic tissue of which they are composed, thereby
leaving a rough and jagged surface. In fact, while the lobules of the pig's liver are
provided each with its separate capsule, and in many instances separated from its
neighbours by a certain quantity of areolar tissue, and the branches of the vessels and
duct for their supply, the s0-called lobules of the liver of man and other animals are
only separated from each other at certain points by the fissures in which the portal
vessels and duct lie. There is no distinct capsule, nor areolar, nor fibrous tissue
between them, and the capillaries and the cell-containing network of one lobule are
continuous at various points with those of its neighbours.

Most writers seem to have regarded the pig's liver as the type of structure to
which all others should be referred; but it seems more natural to look upon this
beautiful liver as exceptional, and bearing the same relation in structural peculiarity
to the livers of other animals, as the much-divided kidney of the porpoise bears to
