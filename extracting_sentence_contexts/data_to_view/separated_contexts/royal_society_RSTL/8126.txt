where the coefficients depend on the first and second differential coefficients of U, if
U=0 is the equation of the given surface. Now, considering the given surface as
belonging to a family, or writing its equation in the form 7—1(z, y, 2)=0 (the last r
a functional symbol), the condition in order that the vicinal surface shall belong to this

family, or say that it shall coincide with the surface r+3r—7(z, y, 2)=0, is e=2 where

V=y/X+Y*+Z2, if X,Y, 7 are the first differential coefficients of 7(a, y, 2), that
is, of the parameter 7 considered as @ function of the coordinates; we have thus the

equation

((A), (B), (0), (F), (G), (H)X4., 4, 4.Y:F=0,

viz. the coefficients being functions of the first and second differential coefficients of 7,
and V being a function of the first differential coefficients of 7, this is in fact a relation
involving the first, second, and third differential coefficients of 7, or it is the partial
differential equation to be satisfied by the parameter 7 considered as a function of the
coordinates. After all reductions, this equation assumes the form previously mentioned. On the Curvature of Surfaces.
