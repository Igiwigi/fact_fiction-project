The attempts made by Porsnurn.e to connect the magnitude of K with the natare of
the liquid were practically restricted to nn extension of the prior experiments of
Grarp on the influence of dissolved foreign substances in modifying the velocity of
flow of syoter, Powkomer confined the fact that certain of these snbstances, like
common salt, acealevate, whilab others, ike nitre, retard the rate of flow of water,
and that in general the action’ increases, within certain limits, with the anonnt of
substance added, At dirat sight it may seem reroarkble that Posen elould
huve sought to elaeilote the problem by attacking its most complicated side; that is,
by studyiny the mutnal wttion of Leterogeneons molecnles; hit the cironmstance ig
exphiined when we remember tat Tis primary object was. to establish tlie canses
which determine the flow of blood in the eapillartes, and to truce the infinence’ of
diferent wlimentary snbatanees and medicaments on its movement. Although no
fondamental relotions of the kind Jooked for were discovered. certwin frets of a
remurkubly significant character were Lidnghi to light. Thus it was found that in
the cave of mixbuves of nleahol und water, there i4.4 certain misture for which the
time of flow imewured np o definite temperatare is a maxiotom, and that this
