ultrasound pulses.

The objective of this case study is to transfer label information from the labelled source panel,
given that the seeded defects act as a proxy for delamination, and transfer this damage label to
the target panel, where damage labels are assumed unknown. Furthermore, these two specimens
form an interesting case study for the application of TCA, as they have different ultrasound
attenuation factors caused by different ply lay-up sequences, fibre volumetric percentages etc.
and both contain flat sections that have different nominal thicknesses (7 mm and 7.3mm for the
source and target, respectively) where damage is present in the flat sections of both specimens.
For this reason the flat sections of each specimen are the focus of this study, as specified in the
label maps in figures 6 and 7. Finally, as the goal in this case study is to transfer label knowledge
from the source to target panel, only the informative parts of the source panel are used in training
and testing the algorithm, which is partly due to the fact that training TCA has a computational
complexity of O(k(Ns + N;)?) [39]. These informative sections from the source panel are chosen as
they contain representative examples of both the damaged and undamaged classes, where these
sections are divided into training (black regions) and testing data (red regions) in figure 6. The
black region in figure 7 relates to unlabelled target data used in inferring the TCA mapping (and
are not used in training the classifier).

The feature spaces in this case study are normalized autocorrelation functions obtained from
the raw ultrasound pulses, depicted in figure 8. In order to make the feature spaces consistent
(ie. 4s = 4) the autocorrelation functions are truncated to 300 lags (i.e. D = 300) (corresponding
