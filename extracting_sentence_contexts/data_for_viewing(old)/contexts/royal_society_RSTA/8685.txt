p- 38) ; (iii.) two molecules of opposite rotatory power, either easily convertible, as in
the case of the isomeric nitro-camphors (Lowry, * Trans. Faraday Soc.,’ 1914, vol. 10,
p. 100), or fixed, as in the artificial mixtures of Bror (‘ Comptes Rendus,’ 1836, vol. 2,
p. 543), and of von Wyss (* Wirpemann’s Ann. Phys. Chem.,’ 1888 [2], vol. 33, p. 567).
To decide between these three possibilities, further consideration is needed both of the
chemical and of the physical properties of the solution as set out in the following
paragraphs.

(d) Dynamic Isomerism as an Explanation of Anomalous Rotatory Dispersion.

The view that the two terms in the equations showing the effect of wave-length on
the rotatory power of tartaric acid and its derivatives are due to two electrons, as in the
case of quartz, is rendered improbable by the fact that substances of similar type do
not show this effect. Thus, -if tartaric acid be regarded as a dicarboxylic acid of the
sugar-group, belonging to the C, series and containing two asymmetric carbon atoms,
it might be expected that the methyl-glucosides, which belong to the C, series and
contain five asymmetric carbon atoms, would give even more complex dispersion-curves ;
actually, however, their dispersion can be expressed accurately by a simple one-term
formula. The hypothesis of two radicals of opposite optical activity is even less easy
to apply to tartaric acid, unless some form of molecular rearrangement is first postu-
lated, since the two active radicals of which it is composed are not only of the same
sign, but are of identical structure, and would therefore give identical rotatory dispersions.

Tt is, indeed, impossible to discover, in the simple structural formula
