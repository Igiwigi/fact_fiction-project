It was observed that the
dissolution temperature is higher than that of precipitation and is independent of the hydrogen
content in the range investigated. This difference in temperature can be discussed in terms
of energy. In fact, many authors have been measuring the activation energy, the entropy and
enthalpy for these processes in different zirconium alloys [82-85] by performing thermal-cycling
measurements with a global approach (over a large density of hydrides). According to these
authors, the dissolution enthalpy is slightly higher than that of precipitation for many different
zirconium alloys. However, the same kind of experiment performed in zircaloy-4 containing
gamma-hydrides shows a larger difference in enthalpy (28 kJ mol!) [72] between dissolution and
precipitation, where the dissolution enthalpy is higher than the precipitation one.
