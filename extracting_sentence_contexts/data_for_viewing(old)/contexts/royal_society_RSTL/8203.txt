and endophlcenm ; but in the enormous deyelopment of elongated prosenchymatous fibres
or bast-tissues in the inner layer of the epidermis, we have a manifest foreshadowing of
that prevalence of the same tissue in the bark of living Exogens. M. BRoNGNIART has
already called attention to the close resemblance which the thick cylinder of medullary
vessels found in his fragment of Sgillaria elegans bore to the ordinary medullary sheath
of an Exogen, and T cannot resist the conclusion that these are homologous structures.
It appears to me that these specimens of fossil Cryptogams explain the development of
the exogenous medullary sheath, through the gradual separation of the vessels from the
parenchymatous elements of the pith, until they constitute a distinct ring ; the light
thus thrown upon their origin further explaining why the ring of spiral vessels never
recurs in the newer woody layers as they ought to do, if, as has been generally supposed,
they belong to the inner part of the first formed ligneous zone, rather than to the pith
which that zone incloses. It appears to me that this reasoning is justified by the facts
upon which it is based. The principal weak point in it lies in the cireumstance that in
Exogens the spiral vessels supplied to the ribs of the leaves are derived from the medul-

# A. BroxGxTArr, in his yarious writings, distinguishes the Lepidodendra from the Sigillariz by the supposed
absence from the former of the radiating woody cylinder ; but his knowledge of the structure of the Lepidodendra
was limited to the ono specimen of Lepidodendron now become historically famous under the name of L. Har-
courtii, Tho series of specimens which T have described demonstrates a gradual transition from the one type
to the other, with which the French 8avant was necessarily unacquainted, He concluded that the vascular
eylinder of L, Harcourtii solely represented the inner vascular cylinder of Diplozylon, which is certainly not

the case, M. BroxGxtant had not 8een the thin outer ring of small barred yessels occurring in plants of the
type of L. Harcourtii as seen in my Plate XXY, fig. 14,
