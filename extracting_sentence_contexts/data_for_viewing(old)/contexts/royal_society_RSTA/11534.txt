These colour fields all have the same shape (see fig. 12). They do not cut one
another, and if we compare the fields of the red and the green with those of the green
and the blue in the previous table, we shall see that they practically coincide. Thus
the fields of a red, two greens and a blue, are the same when proper luminosities are
taken for each. Before leaving this table, it is well to point out that the field for D

Fig. 12

is considerably more extended than that of the mixed colours, as are also the fields
for green and red separately. We may conclude that the intrinsic white light in
each colour, when added together, is greater than the intrinsic white light in the
D ray. This points to the fact that the colours of pigments should not give the same
fields as the spectrum colours with which they approximately match.

15. Connection between Change of Intensity of Colour and Extent of Field.

The difference in extent of field, caused by difference in illumination, was next
determined in the horizontal directions. The four rays, red lithium, D, scale No, 41°7
in the green, and the blue lithium, were experimented with as fairly representative of
