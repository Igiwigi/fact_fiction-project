the origin, course, connexion, and distribution of the subcutaneous, or sub-
mucous, and muscular nerves, which constitute the arcs of the reflex function.
There can be no doubt that a system of nerves takes its origin from the
lower portion of the spinal marrow, to supply the sphincters and the organs of
generation, which may be compared to those which concentre in the medulla
oblongata. The medulla is also, in its whole course, the source of nerves which
supply the limbs, the tail, and the panniculus carnosus, in those animals which
possess these structures respectively.

It was obseryed in one frog that the strychnine applied to a single posterior
extremity induced general tetanus. General tetanus, in the human subject, is
the effect of the local wound of a nerve. These facts demonstrate the strict
connexion and unity of the different parts of the nervous system.

The anatomy of the reflex function must be particularly studied in the me-
dulla oblongata; in the portions of the spinal marrow which give origin to
the nerves of the anterior and posterior extremities ; in that of the intermediate
space which supplies the trunk ; in that which is the source of the nerves of
the sphincters, the ejaculators, &c., and in that which supplies the tail ; and,
lastly, in reference to the several columns of which the spinal marrow is com-
posed. I think the investigation of the anatomy will, for various reasons, be
best pursned in the hedgehog.

It is gratifying to me to state that no part of these experiments has inflicted
