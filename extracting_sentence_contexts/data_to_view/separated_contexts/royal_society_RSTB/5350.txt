The
capsules in each have on their inner sides supporting splint bones, and I was forced to
the conclusion that these splint bones must also be homologous. But the splint bones in
Ornithorhynchus unite to form the so-called “ dumb-bell shaped bone,” while the splint
bones in the lizard become the so-called ‘‘ vomers.” As the “ dumb-bell shaped bone ”
in Ornithorhynchus is not the vomer, which is well developed behind it, a new name
became necessary and I proposed the name “ prevomer”’ for it and for the “ vomers”’
of the lizard which I regarded as homologous. A few years later I endeavoured at greater length to trace out the homologies and in
at least three instances, working with imperfectly known facts, was in error. The
apparently single vomer-like bone in the Chelonians I regarded as a true vomer: I
now regard it as the prevomer. The single median bone in the front of the palate of
Dicynodon I also believed to be a true vomer.
