These properties suggest a discontinuous
structure for allotropic silver. (vi.) If we might assume an absorption graph of n« for blue light, the fact that

’

if light is obliquely reflected from a film of “ B” silver, then the yellow light
is polarised in the plane of incidence and the blue perpendicular to that plane
can, I think, be explained by our theory : but the proof is not yet complete.

(vii.) The red colour exhibited by all the more dilute forms of the allotropie silver
is in accordance with thé fact, exhibited by the graph, that ax is smaller for

red than for yellow light for small values of 1. | Appenprx, added 28th July, 1904.—Using the values of the retiactive index
and absorption coefficient of gold for red (C), green (E), and blue light, as given by
