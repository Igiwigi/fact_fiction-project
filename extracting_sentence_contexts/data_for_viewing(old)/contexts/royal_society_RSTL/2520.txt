Mollusca, under the name of Assiminia Grayana ; and as this name has been referred
to by Mr. Jzrrrres and other conchologists, it may be regarded as established, and
that of Syncera hepatica, proposed by myself in the Medical Repository, vol. x. p. 239,
will take the rank of a synonym. A second species of this genus has lately been
made known by Mr. Bexsox, by whom it was found in ponds in India, Its shell is
banded like that of Litforina 4-fasciata and several others of the smaller Littorince,
and had been figured in the Supplement to Woop's Catalogue, t. 6. f. 28, under the
name of Turbo Francesic.

Taking this in conjunction with the preceding, we have here two instances of uni-
valve shells apparently belonging to the same genus, the one found in fresh and the
other in salt water, but proving, when their animals are examined, to belong to genera
essentially distinet, My next illustration will show that a similar fact has been ob-
served among the bivalves.

The Mytilus polymorphus of CugnNiTz is truly a freshwater species, having been
first obseryed in the Wolga by the illustrious PaLLas. It has recently been intro-
duced, doubtless with the Russian timber, (for this species, in common with the 4m-
pullarie, Paludine, and Neritine of fresh water, and the Littorine, Monodonte, and
Cerithia of alt, has the faculty of living for a very long time out of water,) into the
Lake of Haarlem and the Commercial Docks at Rotherhithe ; in both of which it
appears to increase with great rapidity. I am aware that Mr. LygLL has given an-
other explanation of the mode of introduction of this remarkable species ; but from
experiments which I have myself made on the animal's power of living out of water,
I cannot hesitate in giving the preference to the suggestion advanced above, rather
