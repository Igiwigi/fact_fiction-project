234. In bringing to a close the present series of Researches on the Organization of
the Foraminifera, I think it desirable to combine a snmmary of the most important
results which I have obtained, with some remarks on their bearing, not merely on the
» method to be followed in the attempt to frame a natural classification of this group, but
upon some of those higher questions relating to the origin and value of differential
characters generally, which have recently been brought prominently under the consider-
ation of the scientific world. In 0 doing it is my desire to confine myself strictly to the
scientific and practical aspect of these questions ; secking in the first place to determine,
on the legitimate basis of induction, what general principles may be either certainly or

probably educed from the comparison of the large body of facts which have been
brought together by myself and others as regards the mutual relations of Foraminifera ;
and then briefly inquiring how far the results of similar comparisons made upon other
types of organized structure justify the extension of the same principles to the Animal
and Vegetable kingdoms at large.

235. Tt may be well for me to adyert in limine to certain features in this inquiry, that
render the group to which it relates singularly adapted for a comparison at, once minute
and comprehensive amongst a wide range of individual forms —The size of the greater
part of these organisms is 80 small, that many hundreds, thousands, or even tens of
thousands of them may be contained in a pill-box ; and yet it is usually not too minute
to prevent the practised observer from distinguishing the most important peculiarities of
each individual by a hand-magnifier alone, or from dealing with it separately by a very
