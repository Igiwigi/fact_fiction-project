Again, a different atlas will induce a different, but equivalent, norm.

As a result, the jet extension mapping j! :C!(W) —> C°(J1W), represented locally by w(x) +
(wP (x), wi (x)), is a linear isometry for the norms specified. Evidently, j' is not surjective as sections
of the jet bundle need not be holonomic, i.e. Ae CW) need not be the jet of a vector field
in Cl(W).

Let F be a generalized force, that is, an element of C!(W)*. Then, F o (j!)~! : Image j! — R is
a linear and continuous functional on Image j'. By the Hahn-Banach theorem, F o (j)~! may be


extended to an element S € C°(J!W)*. By the Riesz representation theorem, such an element S is a
measure which is valued in the dual of the jet bundle. If a different atlas had been chosen, the fact
that equivalent topologies would be induced on the spaces of sections implies that F o (j!)~1 is
still continuous. The construction is therefore independent of the choice of an atlas. It follows that

F=Soj! =j'*(S). (2.7)

We refer to S as a variational stress (measure). We also refer to equation (2.7), exhibiting the
condition that the stress S represents the force F, as the equilibrium equation. The equilibrium
equation may be written explicitly in the form

F(w) = I, j'w-dS, (2.8)

which is the analogue of the principle of virtual work in continuum mechanics. (We will be more
