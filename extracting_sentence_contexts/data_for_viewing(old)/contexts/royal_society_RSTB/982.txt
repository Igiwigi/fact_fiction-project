}f the one hundred and eight specimens of S. entellus examined, a considerable
aber had already borne young, and were suckling them; six were found to have
-y lately borne young, and one to be undergoing the process of aborting an advanced
bryo; the rest were not breeding, and about fifty of these, adult females, were
ed, and the uteri preserved, in order to study the phenomena attending menstrua-
y—a Eurasian—who supplied me with these animals,
in April and October, and that, when breeding,
retire into the thickest parts of the jungle, and cannot then be caught. This
nation was doubtless obtained. from native collectors, and all evidence supplied
Ginatives was found to be so untrustworthy that little reliance can be placed upon
gs report.

aring in mind the fact th
had recently borne young;
Dited breeding seasons for S. ente

ssumption.
EI made attempts, during February and March, to induce these animals to copulate

hile in captivity. Two large cages were put at my disposal in one of the Monkey
ses at the gardens, and an adult male with several females put in one cage, while

the other a pair of adult Monkeys were kept.
EMany of the females seemed quite prepared for copulation
gale to fertilize them, but without success.
