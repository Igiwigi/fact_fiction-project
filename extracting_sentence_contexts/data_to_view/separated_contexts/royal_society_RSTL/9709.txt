We record finally, under these statements relating to the break induction current,
an observation relating to the make induction current, because it was a salient feature
: in our experiments with the ordinary arrangements of the coil, and because its mention
emphasises the superiority of the kathode of the make induction current combined
with the kathode of the galvanic current, over all other combinations of the two poles.

11. With the ordinary arrangement of the coul used there was no contraction to the
make induction current with all combinations and all strengths of the induction and
galvanic currents, except the combined anode of the break induction current (i.e., kathode
of the make induction current) and kathode of the galvanic current. The interpretation of this fact is identical with that for the kathode of the break
induction current when also kathode of the galvanic current, Excitation thus coincides
with increased excitability in the polar region. B. Polar alterations of excitability tested by the make induction current.
