then necessarily families ; that has perhaps come about by superposition of mutations,
and dying out of types.
Geographical Distribution in General.

We may now go on to point out what is one of the most important bearings of
the facts that have been brought forward, and which are so striking and consistent
that they demand some explanation, even if that which I have given be not
accepted, In a paper published over seven years ago,* I pointed out the effect
upon the current theories of geographical distribution which an acceptance of
mutation without natural selection would have. I then chose the Dilleniaceze for
no other reason than that it was the first order in Hooxgr’s Indian Flora with
distribution less than world-wide. In the present place I take the Menispermaceze
because the monograph in Enauxr’s ‘ Pflanzenreich’ happens to be lying on my
table. Nearly all families have the same general type of distribution.

In the paper referred to, I pointed out that there was no particular reason why the
whole tree of descent of a family should not exist on the earth at the present
moment, and I suggested that all the Dilleniaceze might be descended from
