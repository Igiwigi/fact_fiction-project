linked together, one fact presented itself in a striking manner. All these bodies are
strongly adiactinic, those which are the least 80 being the hydrocarbons ; Diagram No. 2,
will at once make this apparent, Professor SToKEs has pointed out that one of these
snbstances, salicine, in an aqueous solution, the strength of which is not stated, shows
a characteristic absorption band. Now salicine is a snbstance the constitution of which
is perfectly well known : it is a glucoside of saligenin,

C,H,(O0H)CH,

and consequently the absorption band may be due to the saligenin. At any rate it
seemed worth while to dilute solutions of known strength, containing snch allied
snhstances as phenol, salicylic acid and salicylate of methyl, and ascertain whether any
absorption bands are thus made visible. The result has disclosed the fact that almost
if not entirely all benzene derivatives, including the hydrocarbon itself, are characterised
by one or more absorption bands, which resist modification or extinction by dilution to
an enormous extent.

For this part of the research it has been necessary to make solutions of known
sbrength, to dilute them with definite quantities of water, and photograph the yarious
liquids thus obtained. These photographs have been placed upon sectional paper,
upon which the lines of cadmium as seen in a photograph of the metallic spectrum
have been drawn, and the proportions of substance in solution have been co-ordinated
with the position of the absorption bands relative to the cadmium lines. A series of
curves has thus been obtained, and each of these proves to be a highly characteristic
feature of the snbstance observed. The number of photographs necessary for com-
