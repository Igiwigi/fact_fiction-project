This technique, explored in [55,84], will be briefly reviewed below for a special case. Precisely,
we consider the scenario where we chose the electric energy cut-off to include three states of gauge
field at each bond, namely |1,—1), |0,0) and | — 1,1). In this format, we can write the bond-space
operator algebra as

U=|—1,1)(0,0/ + |0,0)(1,—1| and L=|—1,1)(-1,1] -[1,-1)(1,-1], (4.1)

which indeed satisfies the relation [U, L] = U. We can now decompose Uj,;+,, ina pair of fermionic
rishons, specifically as SiS, wa These rishons are exotic fermions, since they mutually anti-
commute, ie. {8,,., Gl = (507 8} =0 for jz jor uA’, yet they are 3-hardcore, i.e. B, =04
Bur in contrast to standard (Dirac) fermions which are 2-hardcore.

In fact, it is possible to build such a rishon from two Dirac-fermion subspecies a and b at each
site, with standard rules {4,44 wh = (jb wi = 5 jum and all the other anti-commutators

zero. € can then be written as
+ +
Fue = 95 Mundin + (1 — Gj Bin )ajn- (4.2)
The electric field operator L can similarly be expressed as a function of these field operators,
specifically
+ + + . +
QL ijt = 94 Mine + Oj Bie — Gp pti tn—n — Oj n —pbjtn—n- (4.3)
As we perform these substitutions into the lattice QED Hamiltonian, we observe that the total
parity of fermions (rishons and matter) at each site is preserved by each and single term, ie.
