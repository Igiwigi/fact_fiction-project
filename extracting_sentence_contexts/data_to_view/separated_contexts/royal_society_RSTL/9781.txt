The fusing point of the alloy is 177* C. lower than that of the iodide of silver,

<vhich constitutes one-third of its weight, and 33? C. lower than that of the iodide of

ead, whieh constitutes two-thirds of its weight. 5 7. Tf the lowering of the fusing point (alsÂ» markedly apparent in the case of the

Fhlorobromiodides of silver) is due to the fact that similar particles of matter attract
each other more powerfully than dissimilar, and hence, when the particles of two
bodies are mutually diffused, the attraction becomes less, and the molecular motion
is consequently more readily assimilated, the same cause may serve to explain the
commencement of the phase of contraction on heating the alloy, at a temperature
18* C. lower than the substance to which i owes this property. 8. It is interesting to compare one of the chlorobromiodides of silver with the lead-
sIlver iodide.
