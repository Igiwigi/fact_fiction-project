Interventions may not always provide a path to understanding either. Sometimes, it is
necessary to consider a system’s context dynamically and to account for how the system changes
and is changed by its context. For example, a credit-scoring or credit-granting system which
under-rates a certain minority group relative to their actual credit risk could be said to be
biased, but simply giving higher ratings to this group may or may not in fact improve credit
or economic opportunities for its members. That is, increasing the credit scores of the group’s
members may cause some real-world effect which counteracts the benefit of the higher scores. This could be the case if qualified members of the minority group did not resemble qualified
members of the majority, meaning that the boosted scores likely create credit opportunities for
unqualified members of the minority group.
