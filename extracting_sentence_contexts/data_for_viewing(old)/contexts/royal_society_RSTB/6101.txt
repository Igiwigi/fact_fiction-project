as cartilaginous bars, paired and separate, beneath the floor of the forebrain. They
are quite wide apart, as if the skull of the bird were destined to be platitrabic instead
of tropitrabic. Between the trabeculze and the acrochordal, and likewise isolated,
the polar cartilages (p.c.) have made their appearance as spheroidal nodules, in line
with the hind ends of the trabeculz.

The pila antotica is better developed and is extending upwards and forwards ; the
notch is at its base for the abducens is plain. Dorsal to each polar cartilage and ventro-
anterior to each pila antotica, another pair of chondrifications has appeared, known
as the suprapolar cartilages (s.t.). They correspond to the supratrabecular bars which
in the lizard (Gaupp, 1906) and in the Primates (FiscHER, 1903) connect the anterior
with the posterior clinoid processes. The ophthalmic artery runs out beneath them,
and their precocious appearance is probably related to the fact that the recti muscles
are attached to them.

The anterior parachordals have established connexion with the parachordal and cochlear
capsules, and the basal plate is now complete, enclosing a basicranial fenestra (b.c.f.).
At the same time, the basal plate is extending to the side, by lateral growth of the
originally cylindrical parachordal. The hypocentra of the two occipital vertebri
are still visible, and the atlas and axis vertebre are as before, except that their neural
arches have now arisen as separate paired struts of cartilage (a.t.n., @.v.n.).

The first appearance of the visceral arch skeleton is found at this stage, in the form
