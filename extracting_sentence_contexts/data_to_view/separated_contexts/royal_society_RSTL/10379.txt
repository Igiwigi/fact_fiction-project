& According to notes taken on the ground, the young plants, and perhaps those of
Dactylis, Festuca ovina, and Holeus, more than others, are really injured by the direct
Action of the large application of the ammonia-salts. Indeed, it is probable that, whilst
e deficient assimilation of carbon is partly due to deficient atmospheric conditions of
-Aght, heat, and moisture, and their favourable mutual adaptation to stage of growth,
& is als0, in part, attributable to some deficiency in the amount and capacity of the
Foal surface over the total area of the plot, there being occasional blank, uncovered
Spaces, instead of a uniformly distributed close leafy © bottom herbage,” and such plants
As are prominent are forced to the extreme limit possible within the season-period of
Eheir growth, and do not attain maturity before the favourable climatic conditions for
o doing have passed. A fact of interest which should not be overlooked is that, with a high percentage of

Bitrogen in the produce, and a high percentage of mineral matter als, there is, at the

Lame time, a great depth of green colour, indicating, it may be prezumed, an abundant
Z rmation of chlorophyll. We have, therefore, with abundance of nitrogen, of mineral
AQnatter, and of chlorophyll, what may be called conditions of fuller potential growth ;
yet, in defect of the necessary climatal conditions, and, perhaps with a consequent
limitation in the duration of the cycle of growth of the plants themselyes, we have a
deficient carbon-assimilation, in other words deficient growth over a given area. In the next Table (LXXIV., pp.
