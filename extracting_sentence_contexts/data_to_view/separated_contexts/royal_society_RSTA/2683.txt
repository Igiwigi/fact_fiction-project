Column II.—The experimental values of N, Na, and K do not appear to be
sufficiently established to lend much weight to the results. The experimental value of the specific heat of tin at 0° C., as compared with that
of other metals examined by us, is high. It is a significant fact that tin, at
temperatures below 0° C., tends to revert into the grey powder form. [Since the above was written, we have made determinations of the specific heat of
sodium at 0° C. Two different samples were used, and the results were in close
agreement, giving the value 0°2863 for the specific heat.
