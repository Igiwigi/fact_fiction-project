All that we can say at the present stage is that, in the Forest, this series
is of Upper Coal Measure age, while in the eastern portion of South Wales it belongs
to the Transition Coal Measures, and in the Bristol and Radstock coalfields the exact
horizon is unknown, though it is not lower than the Transition Coal Measures. On
the whole, it is clear that the correspondence between the Forest of Dean and the
coalfields of Bristol and Radstock is much closer than with the South Wales. It may perhaps be imagined that the present difficulties originate from the fact
that the horizons, as determined by the fossil plants, are not sufficiently accurate to
warrant a close comparison. Or it may be thought that the productive measures of
these coalfields all belong to one horizon, and that we are dealing with floras of local
distribution, and not with assemblages representing different stages in the evolution
of Carboniferous vegetation. It would be out of place here to attempt to justify the
existence of paleeobotanical horizons, or the validity of the large amount of work
which has been done, in recent years and in many lands, on the study of the vertical,
as well as the lateral, distribution of Carboniferous plants.
