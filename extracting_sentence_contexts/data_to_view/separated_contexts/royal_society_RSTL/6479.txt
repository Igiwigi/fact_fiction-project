Such is the appearance presented by this portion of the brain, in the highest state of
perfection which that organ attains; a condition, however, always the least favourable
for studying the morphological significance and true relations of its seyeral parts. The
original design, now obscured by special adaptive modifications, can only be traced
either by observing the gradual evolution of the same parts from their most rudimentary
condition, or by a comparison of similar structures in other animals of simpler organiza-
tion. By the firs: method we learn that while the hemispheres of the brain are mere sacs,
and perfectly deyoid of convolutions, the calcarine is one of the first of the sulci which
appears on the surface (about the fifteenth week, according to TrEDEMANN), and coinci-
» dent with it, an elevation is seen upon the interior of the ventricle, the future hippo-
campus minor, 'The eminence is, in fact, formed simply by an involution of the wall of
the original ventricular cavity, and such portion of this cavity, situated in the posterior
lobe, as has escaped being closed in by the growth of the surrounding cerebral s8ub-
stance, constitutes the posterior cornu. The variability of its extent in the human s8ub-
ject, and consequent apparent variability of the hippocampus minor, is well known®*. Little physiological importance can, however, be attached to the size of the latter as
: commonly estimated by the projection into the ventricle.
