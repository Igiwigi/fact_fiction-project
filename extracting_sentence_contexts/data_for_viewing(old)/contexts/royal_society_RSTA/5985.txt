from H” and replace most of the appearances of cg and c; by a tighter bound. The physical
meaning of the norm ||O|| c(p,14) is as follows: given a state |y) with a bounded expectation value
of energy (W|H|W) < E, the norm Olea.) is the maximal value of (y|O?|y)/(1 + E2/e?).

The earlier work of Avron & Elgart ([7], §5), while mainly focusing on gapless bounded
Hamiltonians, discussed the adiabatic theorem for unbounded gapless Hamiltonians. They
required that both the resolvent R(z=i,s) and H(s)R’(z=i,s) be bounded. Essentially the same
assumption was made by Abou Salem [37, §2] in the context of non-normal generators.

Recent work [38,39] presents a refinement of the adiabatic theorem for a different case of
diverging ||H’|| that comes from the thermodynamic limit of the size of a many-body spin system.
While the authors do not present an explicit form for 6, we believe that their methods provide an
alternative way of removing the dimension d of the subspace PH, and in fact any dependence on
the system size, from the bound on local observables.

(b) Adiabatic intertwiner

Following Kato [20], we define an approximate evolution in the full Hilbert space H:
Ug (6) = —iHaa(s)Una(s), Usa(0)=1, s€ [0,1], (2.9)
where Ug is called the adiabatic intertwiner and the (dimensionless) adiabatic Hamiltonian is
Haa(s) = t¢H(s) + i[P’(s), P(s)]- (2.10)

Note that both Haq and Uagq are tr-dependent. Here P(s) is a finite-rank projection on the low-
energy subspace of H(s) (i.e. the continuous-in-s subspace spanned by the eigenvectors with the
lowest d(s) eigenvalues®). A property of this approximation is that the low-energy subspace is
