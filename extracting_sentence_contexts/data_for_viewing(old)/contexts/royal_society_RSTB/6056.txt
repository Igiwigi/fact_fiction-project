Ker §. but with certain interesting differences in detail (fig. 19a, Pl. 21).

The blastocyst has a greatest diameter, estimated from SELENKa’s sectional fig. 7,
of 0-67 mm., though in the text he speaks of it as “die 1 mm. grosse Keimblase,”
whilst its diameter, measured from its attached margins, is only 0-5 mm. A single
central villus arising directly opposite the embryo and consisting of a central stem,
with indications of lateral branches, is alone developed. Its tip reaches to near the
floor of the maternal blood-space, is “‘ mehrschichtig ’’ and is connected with the latter
by syncytium. The peripheral or basal syncytium is thicker, more compact and more
complete than in Keim S. and it is a point of interest that a fair amount of what may
possibly be implantation syncytium is present in the intervillous space. Round the
blastocyst is an endometrial cushion similar to that of Keim S., only not quite so massive,
and SeLen«a records the interesting fact that a corresponding cushion is also present on
the dorsal wall of the uterus, to which the anti-embryonal pole of the blastocyst was
attached. No details of the attachment are available but SeLenKA figures a portion
of a section through the secondary cushion (his fig. 8, p. 334) in which the uterine epithe-
lium is seen to have thickened to form a stratified layer, two or more cells in thickness
and with an irregular free surface (cf. the uterine epithelium of Hapale 2 (PI. 8, fig. 57) ),
whilst club-shaped ingrowths are shown arising from its deep surface.

It will be evident from these two blastocysts that the early placental development in
the Catarrhine differs in certain important respects from that of the Platyrrhine. In
the first place it would appear that the attachment of the Catarrhine blastocyst is
effected when that structure is quite minute and at a very early stage in the development
of the embryo, prior indeed to the attainment by the yolk-sac of the fully vesicular
