have had any of these functions but in this, apparently the last stage, they seem to
be functionless relics.

Fic, 10.â€”Three first lower premolars, internal and crown surfaces. 4.

Of the anterior premolar (pm2) there are nine specimens, of which five show no wear
at all and the rest only a little on the posterior edge (fig. 10). Even in the old jaw where
the molars have been worn down to the level of the gum this tooth shows hardly any
wear. From these facts it seems most probable that the anterior part of the upper jaw
was edentulous, or, at any rate, the anterior upper teeth whether incisors, canines, or front
premolars were not opposed to the corresponding lower teeth.* In shape this tooth
consists of a well developed protoconulid from which run three ridges, one straight
forward, which has a small column developed on its front border but only to a slight
degree, being in some specimens hardly observable. The remaining ridges both run
backward, the outer one goes straight back and swells out into an internal buttress
which shows posteriorly the pressure mark of the next premolar; the other or inner
ridge runs inward as well as backward. The root is either single or a little constricted.
The third premolar is pointed in front and, together with the fourth premolar and the
molars, is similar to the ordinary Acerathere pattern. The cingulum is strongly marked
on the premolars, both on the inner and outer sides; on the molars, though present, it
is less noticeable.
