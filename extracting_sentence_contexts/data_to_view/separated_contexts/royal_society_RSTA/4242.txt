Consider the case of
the austenite /martensite structure of figure 4b. If the temperature is raised to 6 > 0p, then this is
no longer a zero-energy microstructure. In fact its energy at temperature 6 scales as the volume,
23, while elastic bending energies scale as 45. Thus, there is a strong driving force, forcing it back
to the unique (up to rotations and translations) reference configuration, figure 4b > 4a. For a finer
analysis, consider a beam of thickness ht, width b and length Â¢ in the reference configuration, : =

and the austenite has typical extensional modulus E.
