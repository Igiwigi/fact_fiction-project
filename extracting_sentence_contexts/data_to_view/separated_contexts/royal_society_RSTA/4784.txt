It will be recalled that this problem
was inherent in the diagram formalism from the outset, exemplified by the different possible
diagrams for Compton scattering. This example now becomes an illustration in miniature of the
structure generated by the graph theory. The equivalence of the two single-box diagrams is in
fact a case of the ‘square identity’ which defines the equivalence classes. The validity of Penrose’s
original double-box structure, however, is an aspect of the capacity of the full diagram theory
to represent loop-level amplitudes and the reduction of these to their leading singularities. On
top of this, the graph theory exhibits an amazing one-to-one relationship between graphs and
the permutation group.
