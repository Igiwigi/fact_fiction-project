It is important to note that it is necessary
to view the inhibition of the antagonistic muscles not as a passive but as an active
process, just as is the contraction of the protagonist muscles. Further it has been shown (25) that two groups of afferent fibres proceed from a
muscle of the limb. “ Both of these evoke reciprocal innervation in antagonistic pairs
of muscles ; but one group evokes a reflex which excites that muscle from which the
afferent nerve itself proceeds and concurrently inhibits the antagonistic muscles, while
the other group eyokes a reflex which relaxes the muscle from which the afferent
nerve proceeds and concurrently excites the antagonistic muscles” (25, p. 340). In accordance with these facts so thoroughly demonstrated by SuErriNGron the
phenomena seen after nerve crossing or nerve grafting become intelligible. Each
group of nerve cells constituting a centre would thus appear to be associated normally
with not only one group of muscles but also with its corresponding antagonists, in the
one case evoking on stimuli being applied a contraction, and in the other an inhibition
resulting in a relaxation, That this result of the stimulus is capable of variation
under altered circumstances is shown by the altered behaviour under the influence of
strychnine or tetanus toxin. Likewise it is important to bear in mind how these
results are called forth by the afferent impulses.
