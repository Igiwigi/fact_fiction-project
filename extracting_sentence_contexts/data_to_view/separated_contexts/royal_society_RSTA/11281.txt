They gradually increase in magnitude as the depth decreases,
and become infinite and change sign for some critical value of the depth rather in
excess of 29,040 feet after which, for further decrease of the depth, they remain inverted
until a second critical value is reached which is somewhat greater than 7260 feet,
when a second change of sign occurs. The very large coefficients which appear when
hg/4o°a* = ;'5 indicate that for this depth there is a period of free oscillation of semi-
diurnal type whose period differs but slightly from half-a-day. On reference to the
tables of § 9 it will be seen that we have, in fact, evaluated this period as 12 hours
1 minute, while for the case hg/4w*a® = ;5 we have found a period of 12 hours
5 minutes. We see then that though, when the period of the forced oscillation differs
from that of one of the types of free oscillation by as little as one minute, the forced
tide may be nearly 250 times as great as the corresponding equilibrium tide, a
