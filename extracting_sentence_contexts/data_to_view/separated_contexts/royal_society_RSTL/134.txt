the Methods uſed by the Gregorians, or thoſe of the
Church of Rowe, or by any other Nations or Coun-
tries, for finding the Time of that Feaſt, As to our
own, ſhall only obſerve, that the Method now uſed
in England, for finding the fourteenth Day of the
Moon, or the Eccleſiaſtical Full Moon, on which
Eaſter dependeth, is, by Proceſs of Time, become
conſiderably .crroncous : as the Golden Numbers,

2 of which they are reſpectively the Golden Numbers,

before obſerved, ariſes from the Anticipation of the
5 Moons ſince the Time ofthe Council of N;ce : And as
Z the Vernal Equinox has alſo anticipated eleyen Days
Zlince that time; ncither that Equinox, nor the New
3 Moons, do now happen on thoſe Days upon which
Sthe Church of England ſuppoſes them fo to happen.
3 When Pope Gregory XIII. reformed. the Julian
Solar Year, he likewiſe made a Correction as to the
ZTime of celebrating the Feaſt of Eaſter, by placing
=the Epacts (which he dirccted-to be made uſe of
Efor the future inſtead of the Golden Numbers), much
Enearer to the true Times of the New Moons than
=the Golden Numbers then ſtood in the old Calendar:
SI ſay, much nearer to the true Times; becauſe in
=fact the Epacts, as placed by him, were not prefixed
=to the exact Days upon which the New Moons then
Rtruly fell. And this was done with Deſign, and fora
Reaſon, which: it is not material to the Purpoſe of

But the Church of England, and that of Rome
or the Gregor/ans, do ſtill agree in this; that both of
them mark (the former by the Golden Numbers, and
the latter by the Epadts correſponding to them) the
Days on which their Eccleſiaſtical New Moons are
ſuppoſed to happen : And that fourteenth Day of the
Moon incluſive, or that Full Moon, which falls upon,
or next after, the 21ſt Day of March, is the Paſchal
Limit or Full Moon to both: And the Sunday next
following that Limit or Full Moon, is by both
Churches celebrated as Eaſter Day. But the 21 of
March being reckoned, according to the Gregorian
Account or the New Style, eleven Days ſooner than
by the Fulian Account or the Old Style, which is till
in Uſe among us; and their Eccleſiaſtical New
Moons being three Days carlicr than. thoſe of the
Church of England; it happens that although the
Church of England and that of Rome often do, yet
more frequently they' do nor, celebrate the Feaſt of

Eaſter upon the ſame natural Day.

]t might however be caſier for both, and could
occaſion no Inconvenience, now that Almanacks,
which tell the exa& Times of the New Moons, are
in moſt Peoples Hands; if all the Golden Numbers
and EpaQts now prefixed to thoſe Days of the Calendar,
in our Book of Common Prayer, and'in the Roman
Breviary, on which the reſpeCtive Eccleſiaſtical New
Moons happen, were omitted in the Places where
they now ſtand; and were ſct only againſtthoſe fours
teenth Days of the Moon, or thoſe Full ' Moons,
which happen betwixt the 2 1ſt Day of March and the
18th of April, both incluſive.
