As far as thermal losses are concerned, strong insulation and adequate sizing of the equipment
can reduce the losses to moderate values. Storing 1MWh in a tank of molten salt with a
temperature jump of 200°C requires 6 m°of salts. Even if an overall thermal efficiency of 50 per
cent is assumed, the size is 12m> MWh7!. This fact changes the perspective for CSP because it
can generate electricity with a sound capability to stabilize a futuristic electric system with a high
share of renewable energy sources.

Of course, this opportunity will be restricted to locations with high levels of direct solar
radiation, typically deserts, which are very far from the high consumption zones of central and
northern Europe. This implies the need to send electricity along several thousand kilometres, but
this is a challenge that could be answered with an adequate effort on superconductivity, although
other alternatives based on high-voltage DC transmission lines must also be taken into account.
This fact also implies that air cooling will be mandatory for CSP plants because there will not be :
any water available for it. 22

3. Anew electricity expansion :8

Electricity as an energy and economical sector is bound to undergo paramount transformations in i=
this century, owing to new paradigms such as electric vehicles, distributed generation, smart grids :g
and a new portfolio of generation technologies, including new thermodynamic cycles especially [8
suited for CSP. Although these novelties will convey new technical features and will impose new :
requirements, the main issue will continue to be ‘reliability’. Our way of living and our way of
working (in industries, services and so on) critically depends on a reliable supply of electricity,
which will be an enormous task in a generation scenario with a majority of renewable energy
technologies that are unreliable because their ‘fuel’ suffers from natural shortages, some of them
