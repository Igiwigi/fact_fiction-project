(2) Investigations in the open Atlantic, carried out in 1911-1921, but with a lengthy
interruption occasioned by the War. For these, we were unable to use the
“Thor,” her radius of action being too small. They were made from numerous Danish
vessels on Transatlantic routes, with no equipment for marine research, and no experts
to assist with the work, but furnished only with a net, and with instructions drawn
up by myself. Though naturally of a very casual nature, restricted as they were to
the course of the vessel in each particular case, these investigations have neverthe-
less yielded important results, and hearty thanks are due to the Danish seamen who
contributed thereto. On some few occasions we were able to work more
systematically and with the assistance of our own staff, as for instance in 1918,
with the schooner “ Margrethe” belonging to the Vendsyssel Packing Co., and
in 1920 and 1921, with the schooner “Dana,” owned by the East Asiatic Company.
In both these cases, despite the fact that the vessels had not the special

equipment of the “Thor,” important results were obtained, and the owners, who
generously placed them at our disposal for the work, have highly deserved the thanks
of science.

I will now give an account of our investigations at sea, touching very lightly
upon the earlier ones, which are dealt with in detail in the reports already
published.
