The field germination of the early sowings is not so successful as that of the later
ones ; blank spaces in the field are, therefore, filled up some three to four weeks after
the original sowing. These re-sown seedlings necessarily correspond closely to other
sowings made at the same time, and not to the original sowings among which they
have been inserted. The technical consideration of such early sowings must obviously
take into account the re-sown plants among them. On the other hand, in order to
arrive at the pure principles of the matter, our attention must be confined to the
original sowings.

Therefore, throughout this account, our methods and treatment have been so
arranged as to deal with those plants alone which were sown on the date assigned to
them. At the end of the account we have applied final corrections to allow for the
re-sowing. In point of fact, the result of such corrections is almost negligible,
amounting to an alteration of only a little over one per cent., at the most, in the final
yield of the average plant.

Outline of the Evidence Obtained,

It may simplify further discussion if we sketch at this point the general results
obtained, by the aid of fig. 1, which embodies them in graphic form.
