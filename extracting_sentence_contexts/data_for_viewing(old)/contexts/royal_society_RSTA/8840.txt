It is seen from the table that the values of @ calculated from Zéppritz’s curve do not
agree with the values of @ directly measured at Pulkovo. The discrepancy is so marked
that we may set aside the supposition that the Pulkovo values are merely instrumental
errors. In a matter so important GaLrrzrn would hardly have published them if he had
not felt assured that they were substantially correct. There remain two alternatives :
(1) that the ratio V,/V, for Pulkovo depends on the angle of impingence in such a way as
to exactly annul the discrepancy. The probability of such compensation of actual facts
to explain a theoretical formula must be regarded as small, and so we are left with
alternative (2) that within the limits of possible error in the time curve we can modify
it so as to agree with the direct measures of @. We shall show that this alternative is
quite possible within quite a large range of 4. But we must at once point out the
somewhat startling consequence of accepting the Pulkovo numbers as correct.

Tt has been shown that a ray which emerges with a minimum angle must have set out
from the focus in a direction at right angles to the radius vector from the earth’s centre
to the focus. Thus for a minimum angle at 4 = 4000 km. we find that even for a
uniform earth the depth of focus required is about 0-2 of the earth’s radius, or about
1250 km. The actual value may be a little less or a little more, according to the way
in which speed varies with the depth. Anyhow, this is a much larger estimate of depth
