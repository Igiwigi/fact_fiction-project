and the claim follows from [10, Thm. 3.3]. If B|x, € £(X0,0X), the assertion follows from
lemma A.4. a

Remark 5.9. The previous result can also be interpreted as follows: if the operator R(f) in (5.5)
remains norm bounded for t | 0, then the (coupled) problem (aP2) is well-posed if and only if the
(independent) Cauchy problems for Agg on Xp and N on 0X are.


(ii) B bounded on ker(Am)

We now study the case where B|ker(4,,) is bounded which, for Ag-bounded B, is equivalent to
the fact that the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator N = BLo gets bounded on aX. More precisely, our
starting point are the following additional hypotheses complementing our general setting 2.1. For
the definition of the operator Go see (5.3).

Assumption 5.10.
(i) The operator Go is a weak Hille-Yosida operator on X, cf. assumption 5.3.(i);
(ii) the operator B is relatively Aj,-bounded, i.e. D(Am) & D(B) and there exist a,b > 0 such that

IBfllax <4- ||Amfllx +0 -llfllx for all f € D(Am);

(iii) the abstract Dirichlet operator Lo € L(A X, X) exists.

Note that by the closed graph theorem Lo : 0X — [D(Am)] is bounded, hence assumption (ii)
