to the conclusion that these plants, any more than the Graminacez, assimilated free or
uncombined Nitrogen. Our own experiments with Leguminous plants are, however,
not yet concluded; 80 that we hope to supply some additional evidence on this subject,

on a future occasion.

Relations of the Plants grown with a 8pply of ammonia to those grown without it.
We have already called attention to the fact that the physiological phenomena exhi-
bited in the progress of the plants grown under the two different conditions as regards
the supply of combined Nitrogen at their disposal, afford satisfactory evidence that the
conditions provided in soil and atmosphere were all that were requisite in experiments
for the solution of the question at issue with regard to the Cereals. 'The great develop»
ment of these plants when ammonia was supplied (which was in fact almost in prv-
portion to the amount supplied), the cessation of growth with the limit of the suppls
together with the contrast between the growth with the aid of the ammonia and that
without it, all afford evidence in one direction in regard to the question at is$Ue, 50 far
as these plants are concerned.
In Table XIV., relating to the plants to which ammonia was supplied, an experiment
with clover is recorded. Reference to the remarks in the Appendix, Þ. 975, will how


that we failed to get any growth with clover without” the | addition of ammonia.

- Hence, excepting s0 far as this fact is itself a point for remark, no contrast can be
