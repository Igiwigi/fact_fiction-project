Thus the value of the sum Eg(w),
where the different values of x are the roots of an algebraic equation, can often be found
when the yalues of the separate terms of which that swm is composed cannot be found. Now this suggests to us the question whether it is not possible in certain cases to find
the value of the integral-sum E&ſXdw, where we cannot find the value of the separate
integrals involved in that «um. What we uſually mean by finding the value of the
single integral [Xdz, is the expressing of the value of that integral in terms of its superior
limit, an arbitrary constant being annexed, and consists, in fact, in determining the
function @(s;) in the equation
