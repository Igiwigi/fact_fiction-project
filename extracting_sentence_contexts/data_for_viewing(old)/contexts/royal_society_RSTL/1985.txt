curvature in all the lateral spokes. The degree of curvature
remains precisely the same as at first, whatever greater velo-
city be given to the wheel, provided it be not so great as to
prevent the eye from following the spokes distinctly as they
revolve: for it is evident, that the rapidity of revolution may
be such as to render the spokes invisible. It is also to be
noticed that, however rapidly the wheel revolves, each

* The appearance in question has been noticed by an anonymous writer in the
Quarterly Journal of Science (Vol. X. p. 282) who gives, however, no explanation
of the phenomenon. It would haye been impossible, indeed, to reconcile the
facts as they are there stated, with any theory that could be imagined for their
solution.

2. The number of spokes in the wheel makes no difference
in the degree of curvature they exhibit.

3. The appearance of curvature is more perfectly seen when
