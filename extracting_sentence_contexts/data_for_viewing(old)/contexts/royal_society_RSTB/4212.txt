é Returning now to the binucleate flagellates, so far as the parasitic forms are
eI concerned, they are living under conditions closely comparable to those of an
g “intensive” or specially favoured culture, as was explained in our first account of
3 ’ Helkesimastiz. Hence, in their case at all events, I am certainly inclined to think
3 that syngamy was first of all lost, the organisms being able to continue existing in
s those favourable circumstances without the necessity for this process. Then,
5 probably, as a useful adaptation, the binucleate condition arose. As indicated above,

the double nuclear division must undoubtedly effect a more equal partition of the
trophic and kinetic nuclear elements. (The peculiar delay in division occurring at
certain times in my non-conjugating strain of Helkesimastix may stand in relation
with the fact that here syngamy is absent, but no kinetonucleus is present.) On
the other hand, in the case of the non-parasitic Bodos (Prowazekias), e.g., cwudatus,
there is not the same « priori reason for supposing that syngamy was first lost ; because
these forms may occur in the same environmental conditions as the other coprozoic
flagellates, which conjugate. There is at present no evidence to indicate which
development occurred first. Forms like Bodo may have developed the binucleate
: condition independently, in the first place; and this development may have been

of sufficient advantage to the cell to enable it to dispense with syngamy. Here,
