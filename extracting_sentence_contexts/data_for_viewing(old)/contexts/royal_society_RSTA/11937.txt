yg Cy, Cy.. + ¢,, but that when w, y, ...y, are eliminated from (VI.) by this means, an integral equation
Pesents itself as an alternative to a differential equation, In such a case the integral equation will, of
mrse, relate to the second singular solution, for it contains no arbitrary constant.

Considered geometrically, the second singular solution thus arising will be enveloped by the complete
@yimitive, and, therefore, also by the first singular solution (for both lie on the locus of singular solutions
E = 0), although it may not be a singular solution of the differential equations (V1.).

A proper change in the forms of the arbitrary constants would reduce this case to the ordinary one.
If the integral factor is @" g'"..., 0,... being functions of ¢, cy... then if in the system of
arbitrary constants we take 6”.¢" . . . instead of c,, the factor will disappear.

Tn fact the ordinary equation

y= pr— p’,
or any other, may be transformed so that its singular solution appears as an integral factor. Put

y=t@—2)
and we find
y— pet p= 42 (22-1).
