However, the functionality of these neuroprostheses will be
limited if they do not also provide for somatosensation. Indeed, in individuals
with intact arms and motor pathways, but without somatosensory feedback, move-
ments are slow, clumsy and effortful [5,6]. Furthermore, thought-controlled
neuroprostheses without somatosensory feedback are experienced by patients as
disembodied robots, despite the fact that they can control them by mere thought
(Jennifer Collinger 2015, personal communication), which will limit their adoption. Finally, tetraplegic patients often yearn for the opportunity to touch loved ones, an
experience that motor neuroprostheses currently do not afford. One way to restore somatosensation in tetraplegic patients is to electrically
stimulate neurons in the somatosensory parts of the brain (figure 1).
