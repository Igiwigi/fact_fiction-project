of 1.5 wp, differing slightly from the LDA bulk value of 2.2 4g due to the epitaxial constraint on
the in-plane lattice parameters of our slab.

A symmetry analysis reveals that in the slab geometry we are considering—a tetragonal
structure with purely out-of-plane magnetization—only the magnetoelectric monopole and the
qz component of the magnetoelectric quadrupole are non-zero. The calculated magnetoelectric
monopoles are shown in figure 1b as a function of their layer number in the slab. (Since the qz
quadrupole component is proportional to the magnetoelectric monopole in our calculation, we
do not list it explicitly.) The monopoles are zero towards the centre of the slab, where the local
atomic environment is close to the bulk structure and the influence of the inversion-symmetry
breaking at the surface becomes negligible, but are non-zero at the surfaces, with opposite signs
at opposite surfaces. The opposite signs can be understood either in terms of the opposite position
of the vacuum relative to the magnetization orientation at the two surfaces, or by the fact that the
surfaces are related to each other by a glide plane, which reverses the monopole sign.

Next, we repeat our calculations for a heterostructure of the same 16 layers of Fe, this time
adjacent to nine layers of (001)-oriented MgO with vacuum on each side. In our DFT calculations,
the most stable configuration has Fe atoms situated on top of O atoms, as found previously by
Butler et al. [34], with a Fe-O distance of 2.12 A. (Note that, while our set-up is similar to that of
