The halotolerance and high sporulat-
ing capacity of FLCU-R, in reference to salt-rich media (up to
8 gl), were previously reported by Canhoto et al. [22]. Over-
all, S strains tended to release more conidia than R strains,
-ie - singly or in mixtures. In fact, a general tendency to produce
inf x ny more spores paralleled a (non-significant) reduction in biomass
Ao + in most S strains in the salinized (versus reference) media treat-
ARTE ment. If confirmed, this might indicate that in salt-rich

environments, these strains tend to guarantee reproduction

and dispersal rather than mycelial growth. This contrasts with

the growth versus reproduction trade-off previously found in
â€œwee R species grown in NaCl-rich medium [22].
