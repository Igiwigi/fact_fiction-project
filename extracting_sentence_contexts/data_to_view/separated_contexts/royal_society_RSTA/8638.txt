After this initial drop, a remarkable enhancement takes place in 14388, which is
not confined to the last three photographs, and which cannot therefore be interpreted
as due to a difference in behaviour of the separate plate on which they were taken. The change is of a quite different order of magnitude from any change found in
Table V. On the apparent law followed by the rest of the table, the true intensity of \4144
on IV. is found to be 1°2, which is in accordance with the fact that it is just visible. The intensities of this line on later photographs, even on the supposition of quite
considerable enhancement after the manner of 4388, are all less than unity, so that
its disappearance is to be expected. The theoretical intensity of \4922 on VII., on
the same supposition, cannot exceed about 0°9 on the true scale, which is in accordance
with its disappearance from this photograph.
