1173, I carried these experiments on with air to a very great extent. I had a
chamber built, being a cube of twelve feet in the side. A slight cubical wooden
frame was constructed, and copper wire passed along and across it in various diree-
tions, 80 as to make the eides a large net-work, and then all was covered in with
paper, placed in close connection with the wires, and supplied in every direction with
bands of tin foil, that the whole might be brought into good metallic communication,
and rendered a free conductor in every part. 'This chamber was insulated in the
lecture-room of the Royal Institution; a glass tube above six feet in length was
passed through its side, leaving about four feet within and two feet on the outside,
and through this a wire passed from the large electrical machine (290.) to the air
within. By working the machine, the air within this chamber could be brought into
what is considered a highly electrified state (being, in fact, the same state as that of
the air of a room in which a powerful machine is in operation), and at the same time
the outside of the insulated cube was everywhere strongly charged. But putting the
chamber in communication with the perfect discharging train described in a former
series (292.), and working the machine $0 as to bring the air within to its utmost
degree of charge, if I quickly cut off the connexion with the machine, and at the
s8ame moment or instantly after insulated the cube, the air within had not the
least power to communicate a further charge to it. If any portion of the air was
electrified, as glass or other insulators may be charged (1171.), it was accompanied
by a corresponding opposite action within the cube, the whole effect being merely a
case of induction. Every attempt to charge air bodily and independently with the
least portion of either electricity failed.
