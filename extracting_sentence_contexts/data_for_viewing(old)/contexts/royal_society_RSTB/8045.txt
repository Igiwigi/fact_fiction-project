uncommon among members of related groups, and the present findings must be considered
to afford additional evidence for regarding the elephants as being phylogenetically related
in some degree both to the Perissodactyla and to the Hyracoidea.


REPRODUCTION OF THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT 139

The provision of numerous corpora lutea, which comprise a considerable mass of luteal
tissue throughout gestation, and their precipitate decline at term, with the destruction of
luteal cells, suggests that they play a vital part in the maintenance of pregnancy for
a total period which is apparently about 22 months. That the accessory corpora lutea
which are formed at about mid-term and replace those of the earlier part of gestation are
in fact ‘active’ in the sense that they produce or contain progesterone has been demon-
strated by Mr D. G. Edgar’s work on the preserved material. It has sometimes been
suggested that the corpus luteum may lose its function some time before it regresses in size,
but the author inclines to the opinion that in some forms, including the elephant, the
corpus luteum may act as a reservoir from which hormone is slowly drained off, for some
time after the luteal tissue has been brought to a condition resembling extreme fatty
degeneration. Physical methods of identifying and estimating progesterone will doubtless
be applied to the corpus luteum of such animals as the cow at successive stages of pregnancy
and will have a bearing on this point. At present, however, the mode of action and
utilization of progesterone remains obscure.

Existing descriptions of the female reproductive organs have been reviewed in relation
to the present findings, and the marked discrepancies which characterize them have been
