centre and required patients to retrieve items and information
listed for them while following simple rules such as only
being able to enter each shop once, and only entering a
shop if they purchased something. A laboratory-based ver-
sion, the Six Elements Test, required patients to complete
six tasks of three sub-types while following a set of rules
such as not completing two parts of the same sub-type in a
row. Shallice and Burgess found that their clinical patients
performed comparatively worse on these ill-structured tasks
than age- and IQ-matched controls, despite performing at simi-
lar levels on traditional executive measures. Researchers
concluded that the difficulty of these ill-structured tasks lies
in the fact that they require multiple executive functions as
described above, yet do not simply reduce to the sum of their
parts. Recently, Cutting ef al. [44] described experimental find-
ings indicating that children had difficulties coordinating
information needed to make a novel tool, and interpreted this
as suggesting that tool innovation fits the definition of an ill-
structured problem. The start and goal states are well defined,
but there is information missing about the transformation
required to go between the two. In Study 2, we used the Six
Parts Test, a measure of ill-structured problem-solving designed
for children [45] in the hope of identifying a relationship
between innovation and ill-structured problem-solving.
