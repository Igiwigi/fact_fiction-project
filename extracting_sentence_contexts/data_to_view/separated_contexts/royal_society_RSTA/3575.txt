This indicates that the particles returning to Agilkia experienced
size selection effects; larger grains (mm to cm scale and above) lifted up by cometary activity
have fallen back to the surface, while smaller dust particles emitted from the surface mostly with
escape velocity and faster were deposited at a much lower rate, or not at all. Indications for aeolian-like features close to larger surface entities exist, suggesting surface
transport of material. In fact, the smooth and rough terrains in the ROLIS images are seen as a
clear indication [43] that so far unidentified material transport and sorting processes must be at
play on the surface of not only Agilkia, but at many more regions on 67P (see also [44]). Although
the air-fall scenario allows the surface regolith to originate from different surface terrains with
possibly different physical properties, the surface reflectivity in ROLIS images of Agilkia appears
to be rather uniform, which extends a similar finding from orbiter data [45] to a finer order of
granularity. No fracture lines are seen in the Agilkia images from ROLIS; if present they may
be completely covered by the surface regolith.
