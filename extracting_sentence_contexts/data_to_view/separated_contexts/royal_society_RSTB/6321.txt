Hoccan’s figures show a slight drop for
percentage infection after one hour’s feeding, which might have been more obvious
if single aphids had been used over a larger number of trials. Another hypothesis which can be put forward to explain the high percentage of
infection obtained by short feeding times on infected plants is that an antibody to
the virus may be formed in the blood of the aphids. The formation of antibodies to
various proteins has been described for a number of insects, and CHorine (1931),
using Galleria mellonella, finds that immunity can be acquired in from 2 to 7 hours,
which agrees with the fact that the aphids appear to be least infective after from
1 to 6 hours’ feeding (see fig. 6). The fact that infection was not completely suppressed
indicates that many of the aphids do not acquire complete immunity, and it would
have to be supposed that the antibody is produced at a lower rate than that at which
the virus is imbibed. Also, to explain the gradual increase in percentage infection
from | to 12 hours on the healthy plant, it might be assumed that a maximum rate
of formation of antibody is reached, after which it is produced more slowly.
