Sts action; these are (1) diminution of pressure, and (2) the existence of retia
Biirabilia. Té will be obvious that the repidity with which the amount of gas in au
fir-bladder can be augmented or diminished by secretion or absorption, is an
‘“nportant feature in this disenssion, for on this will depend the capacity of the Fish
“Bi adjust itself to the yarying pressures of dilfarent levels in ordinary locomotion ;
unfortunately Morgau’s experiments do not throw much light on the precise
‘Bite at which these processes take place. In many of his experiments, as, for
xample, in those dealing with secretion, the amount of gas previously abstracted
Sis often so great that the time occupied by the provess of secretion to restore
‘qnilibrium varied in different Fishes from several hours to several days, and similarly
ith absorption. No attempt has yet been made to obtain accurate measurements
Bf the precise rate of seorction and absorption, under conditions involving relatively
gmall and gradual yariations of level and pressure. ‘Tiree important facts appear
‘Sowever to ba well established: (1) that gaseous secretion and absorption are
elatively slow processes in all Wishes; (2) that although retia mirabilia are not
ispensable to these processes, there can be no doubt that both take place much
¢ rapidly in Fishes that possess such structures thai) in those in whieh they are
wanting} and (3) that ineveased lydrostati¢ pressure accelerates the rate of secretion,
while diminished pressure exerts a similar influence on absorption. With euch data
AS thees und other fhets supply, we may consider more closely the methods by which
in different Fishes the process of pressure adjustment is effected.

In the case of the Physoclisti, which very generally posseas retia mivabilia, but no

ductus pneumaticus, gaseous secretion and absorption must be the only means of
