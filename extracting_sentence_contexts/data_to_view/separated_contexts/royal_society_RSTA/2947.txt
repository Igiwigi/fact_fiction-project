One difficulty with this proposal is that the S layers must have :
thicknesses ds comparable to the superconducting coherence length 5 =(D/A)'/?, where A Ss
is the superconducting gap in S. If dg <&s, then superconductivity is completely suppressed Dw
in S, whereas if ds >> &s, then the Cooper pairs in S hardly note the relative orientation of the 1m
magnetizations of the F layers on either side of S. In fact, there have been many experiments on 13
trilayer samples of the form F’/S/F in which T; of the trilayer varies with the relative orientation iS
of the magnetizations of F’ and F (some of these will be mentioned later in this article), so the .
experimental difficulty of finding a suitable value of dg is not insurmountable. A second objection
to the F’'/S/F/S/F’ geometry is that it is difficult in a sandwich-style structure to attach leads to
the two buried S layers. For whatever reasons, no successful experiments measuring supercurrent
have been performed with samples of this geometry.
