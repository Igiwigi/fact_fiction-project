the Yellow Sea by the moon is therefore small in comparison with the energy entering
with the tide, and even its sign is uncertain. Thus the average dissipation in the
whole of the sea is not very different from 1'1 x 10" ergs per second. *

An alternative estimate may be deduced directly from the formula for the
dissipation, with a suitable hypothesis on the distribution of velocity. At the

entrance, when the current is owing strongest, the dissipation in a strip a centimetre
wide across it is 0°002pJu‘dy, and if the above distribution of velocity is correct this
is 1°2x10" ergs per second. Farther north the velocity is not so great; in fact,
around the Shan-tung promontory it does not exceed one knot, and at the islands in
Korea Bay opposite it is usually about two knots. Further, the width is here less
than 300 km., so that on this account also the dissipation for a given velocity must be
less; the amount in a strip a centimetre wide running east and west is therefore
probably not more than one-sixteenth of that in a similar strip near the entrance.
Even south of the narrow part off Shan-tung the currents appear to be slower than
near the entrance ; for about half the distance the velocity is about two knots, rising
again to 3} knots at the Sir James Hall group, in the narrow region. If a proportional
reduction takes place at all other distances from land, we must suppose that the above
estimate of the dissipation per unit length is correct for the first 200 km., that the
amount for the next 230 km. is an eighth of this, and that for the remaining 220 km.,
corresponding to Korea Bay, is a sixteenth. The Gulfs of Pe-Chili and Liau-tung may
