I find it yery usual for this ap-
pearance to arise in blood obtained by a puncture (as of the finger), and to which no
addition has been made.—R. Wacxzr mentions that in blood taken from the heart of
8ome of the Invertebrata—Unio and Anodonta—when the coagulating fibrin makes its
appearance, blood-corpuscles are seen—often grouped necklace-like—around it. 43. Others have supposed muscular fibre to be formed by the blood-dises ; but I
am not aware of any facts having been observed which warranted the supposition. It is remarkable that a conjecture on this subject in one of the papers of Sir EvErarD
Homz \ should have approached s0 near the truth. His conjecture was, © That the
globules may be the part of the blood, out of which the muscular fibres are principally
formed||.”
