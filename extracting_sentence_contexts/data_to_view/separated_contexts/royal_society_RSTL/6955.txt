In fact the neryous
distribution in these organs presents the same typical arrangement as is met with in
other tissues, but it is compressed into a very small space. Now with regard to the epithelium-like structure upon the summit, it has been
shown that the nerve-fibres are probably continuous with the material lying between
the large nuclei. In fact if the interpretation of the appearances which I have given
be correct, the arrangement may be expressed thus —


MINUTE ANATOMY OF THE PAPILLE OF THE FROG'S TONGUE. 451

The material marked « (Plate XXT. fig. 2) is a continuation of the nervous structure
or tisswe, while the matter marked þ bears the same relation to this as the s0-called
nucleus of a nerve bears to its fibre, of an epithelial cell to its wall. If this be 80, the
matter which is freely exposed at the very summit of the papilla is at least structurally
continuous with nerve-tissue, if it is not to be regarded as nerve itself. My own opinion
is that it is just as much nerye-tissue as a fine nerve-fibre is nerve-tissue, or the caudate
process of a nerve-cell is nerve-tissue.
