The
estimates for Leptosporangiate ferns involve commonly such numbers as 48-64 spores
per sporangium, while certain genera (Aneimia, Osmunda, &c.), have been described
as producing a larger output, rising in the case of the latter genus to about 500;
even this number is considerably exceeded by species of Gleichenia. But still there
is a wide margin in favour of the Marattiacew. Beyond drawing attention to this
tact 1 do not propose to go at present, but reserve the whole question of output of
spores for discussion in a later paper, which will embody facts derived from the
Leptosporangiate ferns, It may, however, be remarked that the large output of
spores gives a physiological justification for the deeply-seated sporangia, and their
broad baseâ€”in fact, the Eusporangiate condition is that best adapted for maturing
large numbers of spores from the individual loculus. The tissues which surrounded the superficial parent cell provide the rest of the
wall of the sporangium and the tapetum; this latter tissue arises outside of, and
genetically distinct from the sporogenous group. There are, however, occasional
abnormalities of origin of the tapetum, and of the sporogenous cells, which will be
discussed later.
