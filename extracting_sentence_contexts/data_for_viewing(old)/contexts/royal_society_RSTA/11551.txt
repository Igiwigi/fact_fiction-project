with similar ones given by H. A. Witson* for the negative leak from hot platinum
in air at different pressures. Witson used wires of the same thickness and an
apparatus of about the same dimensions as the author, so that the two sets of
observations are quite comparable. It will be noticed that with the negative leak a
given P.D. changes the current in a given ratio at a much higher pressure than with
the positive leak. In addition, the pressures for the maximum current with a given
voltage are much lower for the positive than the negative leak. For instance, when
V = 340, the maximum current for the negative leak is somewhere between 12:1
and 0°81 millim., whereas for the positive leak it is at a pressure somewhere near
0°2 millim. Thus for corresponding effects the value of X/p, where X is the electric
intensity and p the pressure, has to be much greater when the positive ions are the
active agents than when the negative ions are. The actual difference between the
effects of the two kinds of ions is diminished owing to the fact that the negative
ions which the original positive ions produce by collisions also act as ionising
agents.

Curves resembling some of the above have been obtained previously by
McCiettanpt, who also explained the increase in the current produced by the
electromotive force as being due to the positive ions producing others by collisions.

‘The author has calculated the number of positive ions which reach a surrounding
cylinder when a given number start from a wire of given radius at its centre and
both the positive ions and the negative ions subsequently produced give rise to
others by collision, in the hope that it might be applied to the further elucidation of
the above experimental results. The expression obtained, however, is so complex
