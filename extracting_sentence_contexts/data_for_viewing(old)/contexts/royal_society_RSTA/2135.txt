dislocation activity is severely limited in favour of brittle processes. Similarly, recent in situ
experiments by Cordier et al. [11] did not reveal any dislocation activity during deformation,
instead observing delamination and fracture.

Because of the apparent difficulty in activating dislocation slip systems, brittle processes may
dominate the deformation of antigorite under a wide range of conditions. These brittle processes
include cleavage opening near kinks, delamination and shear microcracking. The link between

inking and cleavage opening in antigorite is supported by the correlation of microstructurally
observed kinks and macroscopically observed brittle deformation [4,5,8,41]. However, recent
deformation experiments conducted on aggregates of antigorite at elevated pressure and room
temperature reveal that kinking is localized to the damage zone near fractures that formed during
brittle failure [1]. In fact, prior to macroscopic failure, the mechanical behaviour of antigorite
aggregates is marked by (i) mostly non-dilatant deformation prior to failure in the brittle regime
[1,2], (ii) significant shear dissipation and the absence of volumetric dissipation during cyclic
loading at stresses below the brittle failure strength [1], and (iii) the ubiquitous presence of
shear microcracks oriented along the basal (cleavage) planes of antigorite in the ductile (semi-
brittle) regime, preferentially oriented at around 45Â° from the maximum compressive stress [2].


Taken together, these observations support the hypothesis that intragranular shear microcracking,
equivalent to shear delamination along the cleavage plane, is a key deformation mechanism in
antigorite, at least in the low-temperature regime. Although shear delamination is analogous to,
and can be produced by, dislocation glide in the basal plane (e.g. [42]), delamination need not be
accommodated by dislocations in antigorite, where intracrystalline slip is likely accommodated
