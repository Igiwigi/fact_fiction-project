These modelling techniques may contribute
greatly to the generation of multiscale detailed meshes, driven by structural data
from high-resolution tomography. Owing to the large size of these data, also
mesh coarsening through surface and volumetric simplification methods is
an important capability. In fact, the effectiveness of adaptive computational
techniques rests on fast and robust low-level mesh primitives, including Boolean
operators, for both refinement and coarsening. Bajaj et al. (2008) have recently introduced a simple and robust method to
trace the intersection curves between triangular or quadrilateral prismatic
A-patches, while refining the support triangulation where needed. Their
prototype implementation provides for the computation of Boolean operations
between proteins (figure 5), offering a simple way of estimating the docking
quality of very complex shapes.
