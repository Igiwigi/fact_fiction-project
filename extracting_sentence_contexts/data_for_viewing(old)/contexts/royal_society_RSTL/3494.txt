1886. Lead and gold produced the same effect. Lead and palladium the same.
Lead and iron the same, except that the cireumstances respecting the tendency of
the latter metal under common circumstances to produce a current from the elec-
trolyte to itself, haye to be considered and guarded against (1826. 2049.). Lead
and nickel also the same. In all these cases, when the lead was taken ont and
washed, it was found beautifully invested with a thin polished pellicle of sulphuret
of lead.

1887. With lead, then, we have a conducting sulphburet formed, but still there is no
Sign that its contact can produce a current, any more than in the case of the non-
conducting sulphuret of tin (1882.). There is no new or additional action pro-
duced by this conducting body ; there was no deficiency of action with the former
non-conducting product ; both are alike in their results, being, in fact, essentially alike
in their relation to that on which the current really depends, namely, an active che-
mical force, A piece of lead put alone into the solution of snIphuret of potassium,
has its surface converted into sulphuret of lead, the proof thus being obtained, even
when the current cannot be formed, that there is a force (chemical) present and active
under such circumstances ; and such force can produce a current of chemical force
when the circuit form is given to the arrangement. The force at the place of excite-
ment shows itself, both by the formation of sulphuret of lead and the production of
a current. In proportion as the formation of the one decreases the production of the
other diminishes, thongh all the bodies produced are conductors, and contact still
remains to perform any work or cause any effect to which it is competent.

1888. It may perhaps be said that the current is due to the contact between the
