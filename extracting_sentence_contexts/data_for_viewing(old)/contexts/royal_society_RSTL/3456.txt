was till at the periphery of the cell. A nucleus resembling that in fig. 226. is seen
more highly magnified in fig. 227.

360. This nucleus is the object which in my ©* Second Series” was traced from a
spherical into a linear form ; in some stage of which latter state, it appears to corre-
spond to the © primitive trace” of authors on the oyum of the Bird ; and, as then
shown, it is the rudimental embryo. I then stated it to be the nucleus of a cell
(L. c., par. 300.) ; and from what has been made known in the present memoir in con-
nexion with facts recorded in my Jast, it appears that the same process by which a
nucleus in one instance transforms itself into the embryo, is in operation in another
instance where the product does not extend beyond the interior of a minute and trans-
itory cell. Making allowance, indeed, for a difference in form and size, the descrip-
tion given of the mode of production of the one, might be applied to the other. It
was shown (7. c., par. 212.) that in the production of the embryo out-of a nucleus,
layer after Jayer of vesicles or cells comes into view in the interior, while layers pre-
viously formed are pushed further out ; each of the layers being s0 distinctly circum-
scribed as to appear almost membranous at its surface. The same membranous ap-
pearance we now find to present itself at the surface of the several layers of a nucleus
in many situations. See, for instance, the nuclei in the twin cells Plate XXV. figs. 199
and 201. And I have very often found that layers of incipient cells, arising as they
do out of a nucleus, appear cireumscribed by a membrane. Many instances of this
