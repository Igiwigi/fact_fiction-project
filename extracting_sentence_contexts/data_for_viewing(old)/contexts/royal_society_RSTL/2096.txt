phenomena occurred, I shall now offer that explanation of
them which appears to me to be warranted by the observa-
tions that have been recorded in the preceding part of this
paper. They naturally divide themselves into two classes.
15st. Those in which the motion communicated is in the same
direction as that of the revolving plate. endly. Those in
which the motion of the needle is in a contrary direction to
that of the plate.

The instances in which the needles employed followed the
directions of the revolving plate are s0 numerous, and the
extent of their motion so great, that no doubt can remain of
the fact, and some of them may be repeated with a very
simple apparatus. The circumstance of one of the bodies
employed being generally an electric, such as wax, resin,
glass, and of the increase of the observed motions when these
were previously excited by friction, or by a change of tem-
perature during the experiment, naturally points out electri-
city as the cause. It is indeed the only one common to all
the cases detailed.

If it be admitted that induced electricity is neither acquired
nor given up in an'instant of time, then it necessarily follows,
from the reasoning I have explained at the commencement of
this paper, that such motions must arise.
