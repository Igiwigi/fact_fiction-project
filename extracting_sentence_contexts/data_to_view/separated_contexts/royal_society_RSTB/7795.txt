At least one-third of dopamine neurons showed an
additional, separate, slower and more sustained
activation during the interval between the stimulus
and the reward which tended to increase as the interval highest at p=0.5 and decreased towards lower and
elapsed. The signal was the highest at p=0.5 and lower higher probabilities (figure 1). Rewards were fictive
at lower and higher probabilities (figure 2). Owing to money units. Functional magnetic resonance imaging
this inverted U-shaped relationship to probability, the (fMRI) served to measure human blood oxygenation
signal correlated best with risk but not with the  Jevels in response to specific stimuli predicting reward

expected (mean) value of reward.
