Most of the papers are based on research carried out as part of the Royal Society
South East Asia Rainforest Research Programme. The issue is divided into five sections: (i) the his-
torical land-use and land management context; (ii) implications of land-use change for atmospheric
chemistry and climate change; (iii) impacts of logging, forest fragmentation (particularly within an
oil palm plantation landscape) and forest restoration on ecosystems and their functioning; (iv) the
response and resilience of rainforest systems to climatic and land-use change; and (v) the scientific
messages and policy implications arising from the research findings presented in the issue. Keywords: rainforest; climate change; land-use change; land management; landscape
