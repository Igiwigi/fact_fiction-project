ticular, when V = — aO,, the speed reaches a maximum $V at the centre of the gap,
and falls to the value V at either boundary. his parabolic distribution clearly accounts
for the infinite value of the derivative oY /éy*, which was noted in § 11 for the case
where no relative motion occurs at the point of contact. The foregoing investigation prompts the somewhat more general inference that
absolute contact between two rotating circular cylinders is primarily precluded by the
fact that a parabolic velocity distribution develops across the film of contact as the
boundaries approach one another, indicative of an infinite rate of shear. The further
consideration, that the physical properties of the fluid may become impaired when the
film attains molecular dimensions, hardly falls within the purview of a theoretical paper.
