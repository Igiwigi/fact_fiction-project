The kinetic theory proposed by Boltzmann for the
description of rarefied gases has been generalized
to various kinds of interacting systems, providing
reasonable models for the evolution of wealth distribution
[1], for opinion formation [2], for the spread of epidemics
[3] and so on. For the evolution of wealth, the pioneering
models based on binary exchanges, with individuals
saving a fraction of their wealth in each trade, may be
found in [4,5]. A good kinetic model should be able to
reproduce the fact, noted by the Italian economist Pareto
in [6], that for high values of wealth the distribution
function may be approximated by a suitable inverse
power of the wealth itself; this means that a great
part of the total wealth of the considered country is
owned by a small fraction of the population [7,8].
