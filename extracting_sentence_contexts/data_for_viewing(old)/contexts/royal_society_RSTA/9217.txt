possible errors in 7 are so excessive, due to the very large multiple of dA as well as to
large possible values of dA, that it is best to neglect them. There are several links in
the neighbourhood of 17260, where e (—4d,) = 17264°03, and of 17258. It is possible
these may be e links modified in some way not yet known. In the lists, however,
the attempt has been made to explain all these modifications by displacements on the
links in general.

Starting from P,(1), if the first link is e without any modification, there must be
an error d\ = ‘7 in the line 20100 which is hardly credible. If, however, p (A) and
p(—A) in the formula have displacements —d,, the error in this line is reduced to
d\ = —'25. The line 60270 is from Hanpxe. As the di = 36 dd, it is just possible
that the link from it to the previous line might be a normal e or e(—d,) link. The
link 11332°4 from 54617 is about 10 in deficit and may be spurious, and in fact it
leads on into the X linkage. It is, however, w (d,)+°62, but this and those beyond
have been excluded from the list. In support of this further evidence is available
from the consideration of the D, linkage below. A mesh with clear e (—3,) links is
based on P, (1) and P,(1). The formule seem to run naturally down to 18432, which
as in several cases ends the chain by annulling all the displacements. From 34669 a
chain leads to the AuX map. It would seem impossible at present to determine
where the spurious link comes. It may be noted that whilst 34669 contains
—e+e(—9d,) there are lines on either side linked by +e and —e (—é,).

The curious double mesh attached to 40305 contains very abnormal links, but with
the caleulated error —°8 which the formula gives to 40305, the links from it form two
pairs of parallel inequalities, viz., 11845°92 and 14933°8, which deviate equally in
