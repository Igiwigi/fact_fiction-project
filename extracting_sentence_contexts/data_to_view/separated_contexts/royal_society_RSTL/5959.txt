LUBBOCK ON THE OVA AND PSEUDOVA OF INSECTS. 359

No one has yet seen a male of C. hesperidum, but this presence of the spermatheca

indicates that this sex does occasionally occur. Whether the spermatheca fulfills any

l other function, as for instance that of a secreting gland, I am unable to asscrt. The colleterial glands are very small in C. hesperidum, but in OC. persice they are very

-conspicuous. 'This difference is probably owing to the fact that the egg-shell is much
more developed in the latter species than in the former. The two tubes of which the ovary consists, and which in old specimens occasionally
throw off short branches, are by no means homologous with the egg-tubes of other
insects, but rather with the uterus, or ovarian cavity into which they fall, and the short

-chamber 1s the true homologue of the egg-tube. S ln its earliest stage the egg-follicle is a simple projection of the ovarian wall, which
mes gradually pear-shaped, and may then be seen to consist of a structureless outer
membrane, a layer of epithelial cells, and three masses bounded by very delicate walls,

d each containing a large nucleus (Plate XVIII. figs. 1, 2).
