(2) The contribution to the integral from values of ¢ not lying between «+ may
be ignored, the values a+ lying within the neighbourhood where f(x) is of limited
total fluctuation (Hopson’s convergence theorem) ;

(3) By the second mean-value theorem, if f(a) is monotone,

[" {AO Al@)} F(t, R) dt = (fle+»)—A(@)} les F (t,x, R) dt,

where 0S, <4. In the last expression the second factor is finite (§ 17), while the
first can be made as small as we please by taking « small enough, if , is supposed
continuous. The same holds for the integral from #—p to a.

Thus if f(a) is of limited total fluctuation between a+, and is, in fact, the sum of
two functions fi, f2 which are monotone between those limits, and continuous at @,
