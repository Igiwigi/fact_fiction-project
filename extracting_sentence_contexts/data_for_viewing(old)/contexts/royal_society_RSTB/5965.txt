to note that even if all of them were potential DH, (which is most unlikely, judging
from the morphological resemblance of these tips to those that grew as DH,), the
maximum possible number of tips (2 ++ 16) producing DH, would still have been less
than the number (26) which gave DH.

Although in these micro-dissection experiments the nature of growth of a tip
could be no more correlated with its length than with its morphological character
(see fig. 4), there is evidence that the probability of a particular mycelial fragment
growing as DH, is not entirely unrelated to its size, since the proportion of DH;
cultures obtained was less in experiments where large inocula were crushed into smaller
pieces and in those where inocula were about 0-5 cu. mm. in size, than in the micro-
dissection experiments where each inoculum contained only one fragment of a hypha.
In conjunction with these facts it should be recalled that the presence of DH, character
inhibits the expression of DH, character, and that cutting apparently does not destroy
the power of a fragment to grow as DH,. It therefore appears possible that the
properties which are essential to a mycelium if it is to appear as DH, may not be
continuous throughout the mycelium, but rather may be localized at various points
in individual hyphw, and hence the smaller the fragment the greater its chance of
being free from properties of DH, and therefore of growing as DHy.

The transformation of DH, into DH, by DH, hyphe may be regarded as another
aspect of the phenomenon of conversion, and shows that DH, mycelium has as great an
influence on separate cultures of DHÂ» as it has on the DHy hyphe occurring within
its own body. The occurrence of the conversion cannot be questioned ; addition
of a DH, inoculum to a DH, inoculum or to an established DH, culture led to the
