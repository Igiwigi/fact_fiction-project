Figure 3. (a) Density plot (i) and scatter plot with regression line (ii) with a corresponding density plot (iii), adapted to a logarithmic scale, comparing sound
stability (x) and iconic value (y), separating the distribution of vowels (yellow) and consonants (grey) (see electronic supplementary material, $4, 55). (b) Density
scatterplots, adapted to a logarithmic scale, comparing sound stability (x) and iconic value (y), separating the distribution of ‘earlier’ (red) and ‘later’ (blue) in first
language acquisition (relative distinctions of acquisition order of features, following the babbling period), given by the feature classes ‘manner of articulation’ (i) and
‘place of articulation’ (ii) (see electronic supplementary material $4-S6). (Online version in colour.)
