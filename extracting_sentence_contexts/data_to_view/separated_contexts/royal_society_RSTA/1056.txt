OA, OK, and OL represent the limiting Hooxn’s law loads which
are necessary to initiate the transformation in each of the three phases. It seems
clear that OA and OK must be considered to be almost equal, if we are to explain the
forms of the various available load/extension curves, the observed Hookn’s law changes
in the X-ray photographs, fig. 19, Plate 8, and, in fact, the general experimental
conclusion that the first two phases, K, and K,, are very closely inter-related. In a
system such as that shown in fig. 8 we may fairly argue that K, will transform with
comparative ease, just as experiment shows, but that, as the strains of extension spread
down between the cells, internal damage will gradually increase and in such a manner
as to show more or less sharp discontinuities as the effective boundaries of the phases
are reached.
