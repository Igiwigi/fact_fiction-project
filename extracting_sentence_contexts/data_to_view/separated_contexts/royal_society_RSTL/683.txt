Upon examining the ovaria of several women who had
died virgins, and in whom the hymen was too perfect to
admit of the possibility of impregnation, there were not only
distinct corpora lutea, but also, as will be found in the pre-
sent case, small cavities round the edge of the ovarium, evi-
dently left by ova that had passed out at some former period,
s0 that this happens during the state of virginity ; and, as in
Mr. CxvIKSHANK's experiments, the fimbrie of the Fallopian
tube of the rabbit in heat, were found embracing the ovarium,
although she had not received the. male, we cannot doubt,
that every time a female quadruped is in heat, one or more
ova pass from the ovarium to the uterus, whether she receives
the male or not. These facts explain the error which physiologists have
gone into, of mistaking the corpus luteum, in which another
ovum is forming, for that which belonged to the ovum of the
present conception, and which at the time of delivery has
disappeared. Mr. Baver's drawings not only show the changes which
take place in the ovarium, for the purpose of forming the
ova, but also the internal surface of the Fallopian tube at the
time the ovum passes along it in its course to the uterus,
which I believe has never before been represented.
