Scort’s ‘ Studies.’

Combined with this fact there are other important features, in which, as Dr. Scorr
points out (1909, p. 650), the Cordaiteze and the fern-like seed-plants are as far apart
as two groups of Gymnosperms very well can be. The strap-shaped parallel-veined
leaves of Cordaites, and in fact the leaves of any known Stachyosperm, living or
fossil, are entirely different from the much-divided fern-like fronds of the Pterido-
sperms or the almost équally complex leaves of the Cycads. The result is that in
habit the two groups are totally distinct, and it is not easy to picture a Pteridosperm
frond reduced into the simple Cordaitean leaf—at any rate, no intermediate form is
yet known. Our knowledge of Cordaitean and Pteridosperm leaves is by no means
complete, and transitional forms may yet be discovered; but until these are forth-
coming it seems necessary to give due importance to the sharp contrast between the
two types.
