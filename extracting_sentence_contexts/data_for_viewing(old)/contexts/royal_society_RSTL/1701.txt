of the colouring matter of the blood in a diluted serum, and

respecting this principle, which have been detailed in the pre-
ceding pages. Although I could detect no traces of iron, by
the usual modes of analysis, minute portions of that metal
may, and probably do exist-in it, as well as in the other
animal fluids which I have examined ; but the abundance of
colouring matter in this secretion should have afforded a pro-
portional quantity of iron, did any connection exist between
them. It has been observed that the artificial solutions of the
colouring matter of the blood, invariably exhibit a green tint
when viewed by transmitted light: this peculiarity is remark-
ably distinct in the menstruous discharge.*
