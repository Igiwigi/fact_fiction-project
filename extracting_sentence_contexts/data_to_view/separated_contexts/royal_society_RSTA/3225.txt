It was soon found that the E.M.F. considerably changes with the quantity of
mereury. The greater the amount of mercury (the vertical surface of SO,Hg.) the
smaller the deflectionâ€”this is evidently due to the fact that the E.M.F. obtained is
principally a thermo E.M.F. The E.M.F. obtained depends upon how the solid

$O,Hg, was mixed up with the mercury. For this reason no comparative experi-
ments with different systems can be made.
