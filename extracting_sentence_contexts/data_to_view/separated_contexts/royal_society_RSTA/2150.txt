The theory on which this is based is the spreading wave theory. It assumes that
the scattered radiation is the radiation resulting from the. disturbance in electrons
while under the influence of—in fact while controlled by{—the primary radiation. Thus every electron in the matter traversed is influenced by every wave in the
primary radiation passing over it, and receives a definite acceleration, f say, which
is proportional to the electric intensity in the primary beam. The rate of’ radiation

of energy from an electron with charge e and acceleration f is 3ue?f?/V—as first shown
by Larmor.
