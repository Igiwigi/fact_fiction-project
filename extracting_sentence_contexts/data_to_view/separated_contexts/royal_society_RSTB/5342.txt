The relative positions of the two structures cannot be determined with accuracy since
the blastopore may be a vague area and is obliterated before the anus appears. In the
Decapoda most authors have considered the anus to develop just anterior to the site of
the blastopore, but Sottaup (1923, p. 109) suggests that in reality the anus when it
first appears occupies a position corresponding to the posterior part of the blastopore. A similar interpretation can be placed on the facts in Hemimysis. â€˜The anus pushes in
behind the level of the teloblasts, and so it must be considered to be situated either over
the posterior part of the blastopore or just behind it. In Hemimysis, when gastrulation begins, the dorsal surface of the body is far more
extensive than the ventral, which comprises only the V-shaped germinal band.
