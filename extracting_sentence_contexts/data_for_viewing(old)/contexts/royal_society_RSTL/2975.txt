W HEN an object is viewed at 80 great a distance that the optic axes of both eyes
are sensibly parallel when directed towards it, the perspective projections of it, seen
by each eye separately, are similar, and the appearance to the two eyes is precisely
the same as when the object is seen by one eye only. There is, in such case, no dif-
ference between the visual appearance of an object in relief and its perspective pro-
jection on a plane surface; and hence pictorial representations of distant objects,
when those circamstances which would prevent or disturb the illusion are carefully
excluded, may be rendered such perfect resemblances of the objects they are intended
to represent as to be mistaken for them ; the Diorama is an instance of this. But
this similarity no longer exists when the object is placed s0 near the eyes that to view
it the optic axes must converge; under these conditions a different perspective pro-
Jection of it is seen by each eye, and these perspectives are more dissimilar as the
convergence of the optic axes becomes greater. This fact may be easily verified by
placing any figure of three dimensions, an outline cube for instance, at a moderate
distance before the eyes, and while the head is kept perfectly steady, viewing it with
each eye snccessively while the other is closed. Plate XI. fig. 13. represents the two
perspective projections of a cube; b is that seen by the right eye, and Â« that presented
to the left eye; the figure being supposed to be placed about seyen inches immediately
before the spectator.

The appearances, which are by this simple experiment rendered s0 obvious, may
be easily inferred from the established laws of perspective ; for the same object in
relief is, when viewed by a different eye, seen from two points of sight at a distance
from each other equal to the line joining the two eyes. Yet they seem to have
escaped the attention of eyery philosopher and artist who has treated of the subjects
