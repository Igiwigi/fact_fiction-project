I say that the spinode curve is made up of the edge X=0, Z=0 once, and of
the cubic curye; and therefore s'=1. 310 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES. In fact in the reciprocal surface the cuspidal curve is made up of the skew cubic, and
of a line the reciprocal of the axis, being a cusp-nodal line, and 80 counting once as part
of the cuspidal curve: the pencil of planes through the line is thus part of the cuspidal
torse; and reverting to the original cubic surface, we have the axis as part of the spinode
curve: I assuwme that it counts once. The edge is a single tangent of the spinode curye; B'=1. Reciprocal Surface.
