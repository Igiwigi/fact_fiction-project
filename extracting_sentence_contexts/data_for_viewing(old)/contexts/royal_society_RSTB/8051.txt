time, and as there are no signs of immigrations into the area from the outside, the dif-
ferences which are to be observed between the forms from the upper and lower zones
must have been produced by evolutionary changes taking place within the area.

To the student of evolution this particular complex of species has yet other attractions.
The test of an echinoid has a complex structure and shows a number of definable
characters, although, unfortunately, far fewer than are to be found in a vertebrate skull.
A large number of such characters are necessary to enable reliable lineages to be drawn
up. This fact explains why our knowledge of the phylogeny of the vertebrates is so much
better than that of any invertebrate phylum. In the outcome, as will be seen, Micraster
had just enough definable characters to enable useful conclusions to be drawn. In addition
the fossils of Micraster in some parts of the English chalk are reasonably abundant and
usually uncrushed, while often the matrix is soft and the specimens may be prepared easily
and without damage.

In 1899, Rowe published his classic account of evolution in Micraster. This was the first
attempt to deal with the process of the evolution of species in Micraster on the basis of the
study of populations rather than individuals; and to the present day it remains the only
one. With the exception of the work of Hayward (19414, 5, 1943, 1951) and Kongiel (1949)
on Echinocorys, this statement appears to be true for all echinoids. The genus Micraster is
a large one—Lambert & Thiéry (1924) give fifty-two species, which they consider to be
