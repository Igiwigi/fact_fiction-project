Anabas and Macropodus) or in pools rendered foul by decaying vegetation (Ophiocephalus),
or in muddy holes which periodically dry up (Amphipnous), must constantly snap air in
order to survive at all. This habit, long continued and deeply engrained in the constitu-
tion, has eventually led to structural alterations in the form of reservoirs adapted to
contain the inhaled air.

As we have seen, these reservoirs may be developed as outgrowths either of the pharynx
(Ophiocephalus and Amphipnous) or the opercular cavity (Anabas and its allies, and
Clarias and Saccobranchus). We may remark in passing that the resources of nature
are not exhausted by these two alternatives. In Great Britain and in Europe generally
it has long been known that eels can survive for a long time out of water, and wriggle
over grassy meadows at night in their passage from one pond to another. It has been
supposed that they were able to do this owing to the fact that they possessed narrow
opercular openings, so that their gills did not dry up. But P. Berr* (1868) has shown
that eels survive out of water just as well when their opercula are removed, and that they
