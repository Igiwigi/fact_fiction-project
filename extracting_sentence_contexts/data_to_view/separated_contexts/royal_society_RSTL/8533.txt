The explanation I have elsewhere given (* West Riding Reports,‚Äù yol. iti.) of how as80-
ciated movements, such as those of the limbs of dogs, can still be carried out through the associated action of
lower centres 80 long as the cortical centres of the other hemisphere are intact, is quite in harmony with the
facts Henaaxx gives, and is further demonstrated by the complete paralysis of voluntary motion which follows
the destruction of corresponding regions in both hemispheres in these animals. DR. D. FERRIER ON THE BRAIN OF MONKEYS. 445

Puperiments relating to the Localization of Sensory Perception'*,

Certain movements of the eyes, ears, and nostrils, obtained by stimulation of certain
convolutions already described, led me to regard them as the external manifestations of
sensations thus snbjectively aroused; and the following experiments were directed to
test the truth of this hypothesis, and to determine to what extent sensory localization
in the brain might be possible.
