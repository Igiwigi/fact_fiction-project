each will be less than f;+e; Hence the upper summation over the non-overlapping
intervals, consisting partly of the simple parts of these intervals and partly of the
overlapping parts, is less than

(Ex+e%) (fit+er)+(Ea+e’s) (fates) +... +Me,

where M is a positive quantity greater than the numerically greatest values of f.
That is, this upper summation is less than X+e+2Me+Se+e, which, since e is at our
disposal, proves the theorem.

A similar proof can be given for the case of the lower integral of a lower semi-
continuous function, or we may deduce the corresponding theorem in this case from
the fact that a lower semi-continuous function becomes an upper semi-continuous
function when its sign is changed, and at the same time the lower integral becomes
the upper integral.

Bearing in mind now that the upper integral of a function is equal to that of
