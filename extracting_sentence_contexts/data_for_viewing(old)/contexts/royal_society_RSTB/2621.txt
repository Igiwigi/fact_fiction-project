Tangential expansion of the mural area is again in Porites, as in Turbinaria and
Madrepora, accomplished by the introduction of new costal invaginations (see fig. 64).
It will be seen from the ground-plan of the calyx that any two mural bars coalescing

with a radial structure bear the same relation to it as any two adjacent septa bear to
the palus between them. The tangential expansion of the calyx follows in fact the
same system throughout, and a mural ring of thickening might in some cases arise
round the pali, in which ease the “septa” would be looked upon as ‘‘ costee.”

The cost present between adjacent polyps are placed opposite every angle of the
zig-zag mural ring, Secondary thickening not only tends to solidify the wall, but
frequently produces in addition an outer ring of thickening, halfway between
adjacent polyps.
