sess1on to allow me to decide the point satisfactorily. My belief is, that when sul-
phur appears by the action of the pile on sulphuric acid, it is the result of a
secondary action, and that the acid itself is not electrolyzable (757.).

682. Phosphoric acid is, I believe, also in the same condition ; but I have found it
impossible to decide the point, because of the difficulty of operating on fused anhy-
drous phosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid which has once obtained water cannot be
deprived of it by heat alone. When heated, the hydrated acid volatilizes. Upon sub-
jecting phosphoric acid, fused upon the ring end of a wire (401.), to the action of the
voltaic apparatus, it conducted, and was decomposed ; but gas, which I believe to be
hydrogen, was always eyolyed at the negative electrode, and the wire was not affected
as would haye happened had phosphorus been separated. Gas was also eyolved at
the positive electrode. From all the facts, I conclude it was the water and not the
acid which was decomposed.

683. Arsenic acid. This substance conducted, and was decomposed ; but it con-
tained water, and I was unable at the time to press the investigation $0 as to ascertain
whether a fusible anhydrous arsenic acid could be obtained. It forms, therefore, at
present no exception to the general result.

684, Nitrqus acid, obtained by distilling nitrate of lead, and keeping it in contact
