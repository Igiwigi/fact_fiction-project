structure. This is partly because the colours of scales vanish in refractive fluids, but
chiefly because a pressure, insuflicient to destroy the molecular structure, can by
altering the spacing between the plates, cause the colours to disappear.

Recently the late Lorp RayercH reviewed all the evidence, and considered
it, on the whole, favourable to interference. He admits the force of MicHEtsonâ€™s
arguments, but shows how by assuming that the plates of chitin have a definite
structure, they may give strong interference colours, and yet reflect polarized light in
the manner of metallic films. He is confirmed in his opinion by the weakness of the
transmission colours, which in the case of surface colours, should always be stronger
than those reflected.

The fact that many of these discussions are so theoretical suggested the present
work, which mainly consists in an examination of the minute structure of a number of
iridescent objects. It was hoped that this might supply evidence which would help
to decide the true explanation, As was expected, the enormous diversity of form
makes any general theory quite impossible. It is, therefore, essential that any type
of structure should be considered on its own merits, and for this purpose many
microscopical sections are described and figured. Unfortunately, owing to their
number, they have not been dealt with exhaustively. An attempt has rather been
made to show how complicated and contradictory is the evidence. Any explanation
that has been advanced has only been given with the greatest diffidence, not neces-
sarily as true, but rather as a tentative suggestion, sometimes only as a note of interro-
gation. Indeed, in more than one case, it has only been possible to record the facts,
