When the object is placed on one of the mirrors, the images coincide
in pairs, leaving only }g points. The number is further reduced when the object is on an
edge where two mirrors meet. In fact, as we shall soon see, the images are then the vertices of

p
oa) or {ap} ox [F
according as the angle at the edge is 7/q or 7/p or 7/2. This kaleidoscopic construction for polyhedra is appropriately ascribed to Wythoff
(1918) because it was he who first successfully exploited it (in four dimensions).

3. WyTHOFFâ€™s CONSTRUCTION

In terms of the spherical triangle (which the three mirrors of the polyhedral kaleidoscope
cut out from a sphere drawn round their common point), we are considering the images

of one vertex, say the vertex P of the triangle PQR = (/ qr), where the angles at P,Q, R
are m/p, 7/q, 7/r.
