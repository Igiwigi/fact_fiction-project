The excitatory stage of spasm
entirely fails in exhausted or over-aneesthetised animals. Ligation in one operation
of both carotid and both vertebral arteries is almost immediately fatal in nearly but
not quite all rabbits, and is fatal either at once or after the lapse of a few hours in all
cats and monkeys.ยง In dogs, on the other hand, the quadruple ligature hardly ever
is followed by a fatal result. The difference depends on the fact that in dogs each
superior intercostal artery sends a large branch which runs in with the brachial
plexus, and enters the anterior spinal artery. These arteries after ligation of the
other four dilate up to the size of the vertebrals, and supply the base of the brain with
sufficient blood. On injecting dogs with carmine-gelatine after ligation of the four
arteries, the base of the brain is found well injected, while only the larger arteries on
the convex surface of the cerebrum are filled.
