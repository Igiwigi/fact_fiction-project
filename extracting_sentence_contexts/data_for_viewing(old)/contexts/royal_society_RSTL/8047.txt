the strains brought upon it. I will pass over the facts respecting the breakage in the
older clases of wood ships, and confine attention to modern wood ships. Speaking of
merchant vessels, Mr. GRANTHAM 8ays*, ** It is the general custom with builders to leave
the gangways of the bulwarks in modern ships unfinished, lest the hull should 80 much
-alter in form by settling in launching that the rails would not again fit their places ;
- and no builder would willingly copper a vessel when new, but rather allow her first to
find her own position in the water, as she would then be less liable to wrinkle the sheets.”
"In wood-built ships of war there is also a considerable amount of breakage, as the fol-
lowing facts will «how. Our finest screw line-of-battle ships, of which the length was
about 260 feet, broke, on the ayerage, about 2 inches, some ships proving weaker than
wEthers, and the breakage in one case (that of the * Gibraltar ') amounting to 4 inches on
= length of 200 feet. Our finest screw frigates, which are 300 feet long, broke from
to 4 inches; the © Galatea,' 280 feet long, broke 3 inches. Shorter ships, of course,
Tzually broke less than these long fine ships. Iron ships, I need hardly say, display very
tle change of form or breakage when launched, the character of the materials and
KAstenings used in their construction being 80 much less yielding than those employed
EY wood ships, 80 that they resist more successfully strains of equal intensity.
SThe severest 8trains connected with the launching of ships are, however, those which
Fcasionally result from partial launches. The well-known case of the early iron ship
Prince of Wales illustrates this statement ; as, owing to an accident to the launching-
ar, she was left ſor some time with her bow resting on the edge of a wharf and her
