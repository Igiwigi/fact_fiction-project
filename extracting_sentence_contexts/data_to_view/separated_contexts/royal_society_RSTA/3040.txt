Observation shows that this effect must be very small, as, in general, the band is very
well defined.

$12. Error due to Weight of Beams themselves. In computing the stresses no heed has, so far, been paid to the fact that the
weights of the glasses themselves will introduce certain stresses in the slabs. The
weight of each slab is on the average 120 grammes. This, although very small
compared with the total load in most cases, may introduce a small error in the case
of the band of the first order, which corresponds to a smaller load.
