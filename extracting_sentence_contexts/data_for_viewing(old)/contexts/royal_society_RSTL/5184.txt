between them no essential organic difference.

Waiving, however, the organic difference between the * red corpuscle” of the Mammifera and the * red
corpuscle” of the oviparous Vertebrata, and the organic resemblance between the ** red corpuscle” of the ovi-
parous Vertebrata, and the little or not at all coloured nucleated cell of the circulating fluid of the Inverte-
brata, I would observe in regard to the presence or absence of colour, that nothing bearing on the question can
be inferred from it, even in a physiological point of view, seeing that the nature and use of the red colouring
matter of the © red blood-corpuscles” are as yet too little known.

The colour of *' red blood-corpuscles ” is now acknowledged not to be owing to the iron entering into their
compoxsition, and therefore it is not, as has been supposed, a manifestation of the existence of any endowment
which may be possessed by the *red corpuscles” by virtue of the iron which they contain, But even if this had
been 0, the fact above mentioned, of the presence of iron in the uncoloured or but little coloured corpuscles of
the blood of the Crab, renders it extremely probable that what endowment soever may be possessed by the © red
corpuscles”” of the Vertebrata by virtue of the iron which they contain, may be equally possessed by the corpus-
cles of the blood of the Crab.

Profesxor Wa6xx adduces arguments of another kind in corroboration of his view, that the circulating fluid
of the Invertebrata is © mere chyle, not proper blood ;” but which it is scarcely necessary to notice after what
I have just said, especially as their force, 80 far as it is eyident, appears to bear more against than in favour of
his view,
