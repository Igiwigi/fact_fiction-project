5 These groups agree in that the second generation appears as a group of spores or
‘Sas a more or less complex fruit. They may be conveniently referred to together
4 without implying a necessary genetic connection between the forms compared. It is in
pits application to the series of the Bryophyta that the theory of antithetic alternation
is seen to connect the facts in the most natural manner. I have nothing to add to
2 E the suggestions made by PrinasuErm and Scorr as to the possible explanation of
€ the origin of the Bryophyte sporogonium on the hypothesis of homologous alternation. & In this case, however, it appears to be possible to regard the mode of increase in
3 complexity of the sporogonium as independent of the question whether the alternation
§ is homologous or antithetic.
