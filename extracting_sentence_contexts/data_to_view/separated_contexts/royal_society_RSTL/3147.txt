I obtained in this way some interesting results in re-
spect of the relative quantities of electricity displaced at given distances, which will
be noticed in another place (32.). If we place at the extremity b, of the cylinder N, three or more consecutive insulated
8lices, insulating them on glass rods, in any convenient way as in fig. 4., and then
proceed to examine the electrical state of these slices whilst under the influence of
the charged body, the electricity of the distant extremity d, will frequently be found
extending up to the last section Ã¾; and, contrary perhaps to what we might expect,
the point to which the electricity of the distant extremity d extends toward b, will be
greater as the intensity of M is greater and its distance from N less, as if the displaced
electricity not being enabled to pass freely off in the direction b d, supposing M posi-
tively charged, was continually, as it were, bounding back or reverberating upon the
extremity b, a fact which may be further observed in the following experiment. Exp. 8. Oppose a cylindrical conductor D, fig.
