section represents intense colouring. 'The tabulz are almost colourless.

When the corallum is boiled for a long period in caustic potash the blue colour
remains unaltered, When the calcareous matter is removed from the corallum by
means of hydrochloric acid, the colouring-matter is set free, and remaining suspended
in the fluid gives it a blue tint. It is, however, not in solution, but can be observed
under the microscope to exist in the fluid in the form of small, amorphous, intensely
blue masses adhering to s8mall shreds of tissue, &c., and in this condition may be proved
to be insoluble in strong hydrochloric acid. If the coloured solution formed by hydro-
chloric acid be filtered, the blue colouring-matter remains on the filter, and the filtrate
has only a very slight greenish tint.

* This fact concerning Tubipora 8cems not to be well known. Cavs, T. c. p. 204, says : © Unter Ausschluss
von Kalkkirpern entstchen endlich die festen Kalkskelete der Tubiporen und simmtlicher Madreporarien.” The
fact was well known, however, to Professor Wyy11az Twous0x, who directed my attention to it. Prof. Tuoxs0N
does not know, however, where the fact is published (he thinks possibly by Prof. PzroeyaL Warcur in the
© Ann, and Mag. of Nat. Hist.”). Disks of s0ft tissue spread from tho mouths of the tubes of growing parts of the
coral. The disks contain an open network of calcareous matter, evidently composed of fused spicules, The

Aisks fuse with neighbouring ones and form the horizontal lamine.
