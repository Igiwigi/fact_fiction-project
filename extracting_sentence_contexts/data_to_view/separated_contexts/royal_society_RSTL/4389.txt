And just as the chemist seeks to de-
termine the laws of chemical affinity by observation and experiment, $0 does the
philosophic physiologist aim to discover the general plan on which the vital force is
exerted, in the production of the wonderful series of organized structures which have
successively presented themselves on this globe. In speaking of Heat as the physical agent especially concerned in the development
of living organisms, and in the maintenance of their activity, the author would by
no means leave out of view the other physical forces, a/l of which, if correlated to
each other, as well as to the vital forces, must be capable of exerting an important
influence on these processes. He has merely selected Heat, as the one whose opera-
tion is most extensive and most easily demonstrated ; and every fact which indicates
that other physical agencies are also in operation, will (of course) only add weight to
bis argument. To the universally-admitted agency of Light, in directly exciting one
(at least) of the most important processes of vegetable growth, reference has already
been made. But there is evidence that light has an influence upon certain processes
of development, which cannot be accounted for by its agency in the fixation of car-
bon from the atmosphere, and in the production of organic compounds.
