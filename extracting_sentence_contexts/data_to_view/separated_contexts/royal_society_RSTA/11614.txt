They apply, in particular, to the expansion of a function
in both the sine and cosine series of Fourrer. It is in the light of our knowledge of
the properties of the latter series that the narrowness above referred to becomes
evident. In point of fact, the Hilbert-Schmidt theory is only applicable to Fourrerâ€™s
series corresponding to a function which has a continuous second differential coefticient
in (0, 7), and which furthermore satisfies certain boundary conditions at the end
points of the interval. For example, in the case of the sine series, the function must
vanish at both end points. It would appear, therefore, that the wide generality as
to the system of normal functions is obtained at the cost of the generality of the
function which it is desired to represent.
