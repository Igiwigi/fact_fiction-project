In particular, we
assume that, for each model separately, the total AMV is the sum of the iAMV and fAMV (ie. AMV =iAMV + fAMV). By exploiting the fact that making an ensemble mean should remove


the internal variability to reveal the common forced response, we first compute [AMV for each
model individually by using the ensemble mean SST. To compute the iAMV, we compute the
relevant AMV index from each member separately, and then make this index relative to the fAMV
index for that model; in other words, the iAMV for each individual member is defined as the
residual variability (e.g. AMV} = AMV; — fAMV"™, where n is the ensemble member and m1 is
the model).
