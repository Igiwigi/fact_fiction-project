By A. Ecerron, F.R.S.

The phenomenon of “ knock” is definitely a chemical one. Whether or not a
combustible mixture will give rise to a knocking type of explosion, depends on the
character of the chemical reactions which are taking place, not on the physical

+ The fact that the concentration of inhibitor necessary to prevent “ knock” is of about the same order
as the concentration of “ peroxide” necessary to cause “ knock” points to the collision of two active mole-
cules of the chain carrier as being needed for the chain branching, for then the chance of breaking
the chain by the inhibitors becomes similar to the chance of the explosion. ‘This possibility is being
further examined.

the rate of those reactions.
