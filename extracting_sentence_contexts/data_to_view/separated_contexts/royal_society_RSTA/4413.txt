From these 11 responses, in each context, the authors selected
two. In context ci, the selected responses were those to @ =40°,45°, so, formally, cy can be
identified with (q1,q2); in contexts cz and c3 the selected responses were those to @ = 45°, 50°
and to @ =50°,40°, respectively, making cz = (q2,q3) and c3 = (q3,q1). It is irrelevant to the logic
of the analysis that each context in fact contained all three tilts q1,q2,q3, as well as eight other
tilts. (Reference [29] includes a variety of other combinations of three objects and three contexts
extracted from the experiment in question. The dataset for the combination described here was
kindly made available to us by Asano et al. [29].)
The results of the experiment are shown in the diagram of expected values below:

The criterion of non-contextuality for a rank 3 cyclic system has the form

AC =51((ViW2), (V2Ws), (V3W1)) — 1 = 90 |(V;) — (W))| <0, (4.1)

where

51 (x,y, Z) =max(x +y —z,x-—y+z,—x+y+z,—-xX—y—2Z). The calculation shows AC = —1.233, no evidence for contextuality.
