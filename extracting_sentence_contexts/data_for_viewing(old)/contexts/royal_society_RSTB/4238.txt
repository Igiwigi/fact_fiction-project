In fig. 4, Plate 32, of his paper, a figure of the side of the skull of Platypus with
the zygomatic arch removed, it is at once obvious that the area labelled plt. tmp.,
and supposed by him to be a “temporal plate of the palatine,” is really entirely the
ossified ala temporalis, as is shown conclusively by the passage of the “ pterygoid
canal” through it and by the articulation of the Echidna pterygoid with its lower and
outer edge.

The large bone labelled ali. sph. (alisphenoid) is really the large ossification in the
membrane closing the sphenoparietal fissure, which in Specimen £ is in complete
continuity with the anterior ossification in the periotic capsule.

The bone labelled mast. pter. (ala pterotica mastoidea) can only be an ossification
of the commissura parieto-orbitalis, a view which is supported by the fact that in
Prof. Szeney’s fig. 7 (‘Q.J.G.S.,’ vol. 56, p. 648 (1900)) its anterior end is seen
to be squarely truncated and separated by a space from the squarely truncated
hinder end of the “ postfrontal,” that is the ossification in the ala orbitalis. In
Prof. vAN Brome en’s skull it is no doubt in complete osseous connection with the
rest of the periotic, but whether it be ossified by extension from the great cartilage
ossification which surrounds the foramen fallopii, or whether, as I think perhaps more
probable, it arises from a separate centre, is unknown. In vaN BemMeven’s figure
the suture labelled pre. ptrg. is probably that between the pars cochlearis of the
periotic and the basisphenoid.

In this figure the area of bone between the foramen “rotundum” and the
* sphenorbital and optic” foramen, which is labelled sph. bsl. (basisphenoid), is at
