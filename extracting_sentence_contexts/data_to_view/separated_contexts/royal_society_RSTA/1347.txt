This interval depends continuously on ft and at t = 4 the right-hand endpoint is 1, while at f= —A
the left-hand endpoint is —1. Therefore, f is constant on [—1, 1], giving the result. a

Remark 3.7. A more sophisticated proof is to use the fact that any rotation is a product of a
finite number of rotations about e and é, as proved in [12] (see also [13]). Thus p(Rp) = p(p) for
all R € SO(3), so that p is constant. Corollary 3.8.
