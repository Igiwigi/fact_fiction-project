The fall was therefore practically at an end by the 35th second. In this rapidity
of action iso-propy] is not far removed from iso-butyl nitrite, though, as already stated,
a close comparison of the effects of the two bodies shows the latter to be somewhat
less powerful as a reducer of pressure.

Another point of resemblance lies in the fact that the recovery of pressure is rapidly
brought about by the return of tone in the arterioles, with or without a marked
acceleration in pulse rate. The rise of pressure towards the normal is at first rapidly
accomplished, but after repeated administrations without the production of a serious
permanent fall of pressure, the recovery of the normal pressure becomes much more
gradual after the administration of the nitrite.
