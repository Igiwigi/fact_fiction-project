cal and evolutionary processes acting at different spatial and temporal scales [1,2].
Ultimately, historical factors are responsible for the richness and composition of
regional biotas from which local communities form [3,4]. Consequently, there is
an increasing interest on evolutionary approaches to understand biodiversity
[4-6]. The evolutionary component of biodiversity patterns have been tradition-
ally assessed by reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships among extant
species or by using the fossil record [7]. Relying on one type of historical infor-
mation only (i.e. molecular phylogenies or fossil occurrences data) biases our
understanding of evolutionary influences on biodiversity. Thus, recent claims
