X= (Xi +X +4s)/3 = 5440.

The maximum anisotropy, namely y,;—y, = 14-6, is only }% of the mean suscepti-
bility. This is not much higher than the anisotropy which might be expected even from

the direct influence of the crystalline fields on the spins, as distinguished from the
influence exerted on them indirectly through the spin-orbit coupling, which we have
considered here. The low anisotropy predicted by the theory is thus verified.

In fact the observed anisotropy of the crystal is of the same order of magnitude as its
diamagnetic anisotropy, as will be clear from the following data for the anisotropy of
the diamagnetic crystal K,Al(C,O,),.3H,O, which is isomorphous with the above
chromic salt (see Part IV of this paper, p. 351):

RPh 6-9,
—X%s=— 1st,
y=+19°.

The low anisotropy of the salts of trivalent chromium—nearly as low as if the Crt * +
ion were in the S-state, instead of in 4F —is very significant, and explains the suitability
of these salts as working material for the production of low temperatures by the Debye-
Giauque method.
