The arguments on which-I have founded my opinions have

irresistibly to the very'same conclusion.

When you andI examined together the line of our northern
fagades, we studiously sought for the points where nature
had made any change in her materials or their arrangement,
hoping that at the junctions of these little systems, we should
find some facts that would throw light on the subject; but
we generally failed ; want of perpendicularity, or other local

it is the practice of the workmen to leave: small, cylindrical
portions standing, for the purpose of determining the height
