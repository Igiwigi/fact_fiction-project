Of these fourteen genera, five (marked in italics) are peculiar; one, Micrivalus,
is confined to Malabar and Ceylon; of another, Uraotyphlus, the only known
species not inhabiting the Malabar tract is found in Western Africa. Rana, Rhaco-
phorus, Ixalus, Microhyla, Callula, Bufo, and Ichthyophis ave Burmese, all of them
except Fvalus and Callula are Himalayan, and all except Iaalus and Ichthyophis are
widely distributed in the Indian Peninsula.

The freshwater fishes found in the Malabar tract, but not elsewhere in the Indian
Peninsula, are Silurus, two carps (Homaloptera and Scaphiodon), and Sicydium, one
of the gobies. None of these is of importance.

The distinctive characters of the Malabar fauna areâ€”(1) the presence of so many
genera that do not occur in other parts of the Peninsula ; (2) the remarkable fact
that amongst mammals and birds many of these forms are Himalayan or Burmese or
both, whilst amongst the reptiles the majority, and amongst batrachia one-half, of
the peculiar Malabar types are not represented in the Himalayas or Burma, but are
for the most part restricted to the Malabar tract. The sole mammalian genus
similarly restricted, Platacanthomys, is a remarkable murine rodent, with strong

is the South Chinese Typhlomys.
