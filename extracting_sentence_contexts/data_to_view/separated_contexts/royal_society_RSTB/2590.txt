MARTA M. OGILVIE ON THE MICROSCOPIC AND

Lophoseris, etc, (of figs. 428, 46). Hence I would apply to the wall in Madrepora,
Turbinaria, and Porites exclusively the name of a porous theca, thereby indicating
(1) the fact that a tangential thecal ring of calcification is present, even if it is not
continuously developed during upward growth of the polyp; (2) its structural homo-
logy with the usually compact theca of Turbinolide, Pocilloporidae, and Oculinide. The same relations obtain in all these cases between the theca and the septa, whether
the theea be porous or compact. The interrupted development of a skeletal structure is nothing unusual.
