But we may look at the purpose of tests from another view-point. Without hoping
to know whether each separate hypothesis is true or false, we may search for rules to
govern our behaviour with regard to them, in following which we insure that, in the
long run of experience, we shall not be too often wrong. Here, for example, would be
such a “rule of behaviour”: to decide whether a hypothesis, H, of a given type be
rejected or not, calculate a specified character, x, of the observed facts ; if « > 2» reject
H, if x = x, accept H. Such a rule tells us nothing as to whether in a particular case
H is true when x = a or false when z > 2. But it may often be proved that if we
behave according to such a rule, then in the long run we shall reject H when it is true
not more, say, than once in a hundred times, and in addition we may have evidence
that we shall reject H sufficiently often when it is false. If we accept the words “ an efficient test of the hypothesis H ” to mean simply such
a rule of behaviour as just described, then we agree with Bore that efficient tests
are possible.
