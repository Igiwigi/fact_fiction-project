Most of the prothalli had an embryo attached to the under surface, and
these and the young plants in the culture were all of normal structure and mode of
origin. No further apogamous developments had occurred. The change in the
behaviour of the prothalli was explained by the fact that, previous to August, 1896,
the culture had not been watered from above. To this the large size of the prothalli
and the cases of apogamy stood in direct relation, Shortly after the date mentioned
the prothalli were regularly watered: as a result fertilisation ensued, and the
development of the young plants checked the growth of the prothalli and their
tendency to the apogamous production of buds. Athyrium Filix-famina, Bern.
