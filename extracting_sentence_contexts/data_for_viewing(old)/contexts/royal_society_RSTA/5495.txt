in the Kullback-Liebler divergence, or relative entropy, between two probability distributions p DR
and q, given by Dxi(p,q) = >-; pi n(pi/qi) [40,41]. One can interpret DxL (p,q) as a measure of the : 4

In practice, since we apply this measure to images, we use pixel intensities as a choice for the
function jz, making sure that only positive numbers are included in our pixel intensity scale. The
transformations of interest do not typically map an image entirely onto itself. Some sections of the
transformed image land at locations outside of the rectangular region of the original image and
some sections of the original image do not overlap with the rectangular region of the transformed
image. We handle this by only computing the integral in equation (2.1) over the intersection of the
image and its transformation, which we denote by D. In doing so, we lose the symmetry between
wand T, in TL, since the domain D of integration generally contains different parts of the image
and its transformation rather than all of both. For the biological images considered in this study,
this means that the domain of integration may exclude parts of the image background, which
we do not need to consider in assessing symmetries. Other ‘boundary conditions’ may be more
