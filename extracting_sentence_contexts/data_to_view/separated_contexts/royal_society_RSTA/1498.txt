Also composite-based scaffolds
containing multiple polymers or incorporating biomolecules can be fabricated in order to further
tune the material composition for subsequent cell colonization [62]. One of the characteristics
of SC/PL processing conditions is the need for two solvents during the process. In fact, SC/PL
requires a good solvent for the polymer fraction (that does not dissolve the porogen) and, in a
second step, the use of a solvent that selectively dissolves the porogen while leaving the cast
polymer fraction intact. The use of two solvents of opposing solute affinity dramatically reduces â€˜s
the possibility to maintain biocompatible conditions throughout the whole material fabrication
process. As a consequence, the technique is not used for cell encapsulation and only cell
colonization has been described.
