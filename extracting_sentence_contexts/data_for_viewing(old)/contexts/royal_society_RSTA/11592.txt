The value of V*/v is, of course, the same as the adiabatic elasticity, and, like the
isothermal elasticity, it has the dimensions of a pressure. It will be remembered
that V was measured in centimetres per second, and v in cub. centims. per grm.
Consequently, the elasticity, as calculated above, must be given in absolute units, or
dynes per sq. centim. It was found more convenient to change to pressures measured
in millimetres of mercury, and this can be readily done by dividing all the former
numbers by 1334°2.

V. Marnematicat Discussion or Precepina Resuts.

We noticed above that for equal volumes the adiabatic elasticity is roughly a linear
function of the temperature, and this fact seems to hold out some hope of bringing
all the experimental results obtained under the power of analysis. An inspection
of the diagram shows that the difference between the isochorals actually drawn and
straight lines is no greater than the uncertainty due to experimental errors, so that
as far as the direct evidence goes it is possible that the isochorals are really straight.
Even if it should turn out on subsequent investigation that the isochorals are slightly
curved, the treating them as straight lines may be considered as a first approximation
to the truth, and as a justifiable simplification of a very complex problem.

Let us call the adiabatic elasticity measured in millimetres of mercury E, then we
may put ;

E=gT —/h,
