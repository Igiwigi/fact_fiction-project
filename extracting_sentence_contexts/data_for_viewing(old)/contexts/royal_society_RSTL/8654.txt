surface, viz. whether this reaction was adequate in amount to produce the motion. This
point has now been cleared up. Woe have :â€”

1. The remarkable agreement between the law of the resistance experienced by the
mill and the peculiar law of the resistance which air offers at small tension.

2. Dr. ScuvsvER's positive proof that the force which acts on the vanes arises within
the mill itself.

3. The exceedingly small magnitude of the actual force, as shown by quantitive
measurements.

4. The fact that the estimated difference of temperature necessary to produce heat-
reactions of equal magnitude with the forces which act is well within the difference of
temperature actually found to exist.

Taking all these facts into consideration, it seems to me that the evidence is conclu-
sive as regards the nature of the forces which cause the motion in light-mills, and that
