MAXwWELL’s stresses would produce no change in the dimensions of a ring magnetised
by a uniform circumferential field, whereas Biowetut has found considerable change
both in the diameter and the volume of rings of iron.

The theory of magnetic stress has, however, been extended, chiefly by v. Hetm-
HoLTz,{ KrrconHorr,§ Professor J. J. THomson,|| and Herrz,‘) who have shown that,
in addition to MAxwe t’s distribution of stress, there are other stresses in a mag-
netised body due to the fact that the magnetisation depends upon the strain in
the body.

Hitherto no direct experiments have been made with the object of ascertaining
whether these stresses, in addition to those of MAxweELL, are sufficient to account
for the observed deformation of bodies placed in a magnetic field. The facts that
“Villari reversals” of opposite kinds exist in iron and cobalt, and also opposite
reversals of magnetic deformation, and that in nickel (at any rate at moderate field-
