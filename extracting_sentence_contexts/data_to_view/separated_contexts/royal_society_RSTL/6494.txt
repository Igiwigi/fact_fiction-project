A melting of another
indefinitely thin layer will then take place, and the above process will be repeated, the
velocity increasing till the continuous action of the plane on the mass becomes equal to
the weight resolved in the direction of the plane. During this time (probably too short
to be estimated) the motion will be an accelerated one, but will thenceforward become
uniform, the action of the plane becoming equal to the resolved part of the weight along
it. The uniform velocity is, in fact, a terminal velocity, similar to that of a stone
descending in water, when it s00n approximates to a nearly uniform motion. The
action of the inclined plane on the moving mass, like that of the resistance of the water
on the stone, has this propertyâ€”that, while it is incapable of exerting any but the
smallest force to hold the body absolutely at rest, it exerts a retarding force upon it in
uniform motion, equal to that of gravity. The objections above mentioned against the
sliding of glaciers have arisen from an entire misconception of this kind of mechanical
action.
