@ For the most general case of seolotropy, the dispersional energy W. must be either
“® quadratic function of first differential coefficients of (f, g, h), or else a lineo-linear
‘unction of ( f, g, h) and its second differential coefficients, If the first alternative be
‘Gejected for the reason just given, there remains a form of which MacCutiacu’s is
the special case in which the second differential coefficients group themselves into the
rator V2, A reason for this restriction is not obvious, unless we may take the
already determined for an isotropic medium as showing that the dispersion
wrises from the interaction of (/, g, h) on V? (f, 9, 4); such a restriction is in fact
Alemonstrable when we bear in mind the scalar character of the energy-function. The Influence of Dispersion on Reflexion. 84.
