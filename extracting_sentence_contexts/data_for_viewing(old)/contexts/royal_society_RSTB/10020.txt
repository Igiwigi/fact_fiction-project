composition and structure, support large wildfires during the
driest years, when there is abundant dry biomass [9].

However, a serious cause for concern among tropical
ecologists and conservation biologists is that anthropogenic
fires are becoming increasingly common, not only burning
in savannas, but spreading into SDTF [10]. This concern is
predicated on the assumption by most ecologists that,
unlike savanna, SDTF is not a fire-adapted ecosystem due
to the lack of fire adaptation/tolerant features of many con-
stituent arboreal species, and, in particular, the prevalence
of fire-sensitive columnar cacti (Cereus spp.) in this ecosystem
[6]. However, the fact that some arboreal taxa (e.g. Astronium
(Myracrodruon) urundeuva and Aspidosperma quirandy) have
fire-resistant bark, raises the possibility of some degree of fire
resilience within this ecosystem. The likelihood of local con-
trolled fires escaping to become uncontrolled SDTF wildfires
will only increase in the coming decades as forest flammability
increases under a future warmer and drier climate [7], poten-
tially posing a serious threat to the long-term viability of the
SDTF ecosystem.
