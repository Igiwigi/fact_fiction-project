ON THE COLOUR-PHYSIOLOGY OF HIGHER CRUSTACEA. 331

As a guide to generic and specific characters, the primary system has high claims.
We have seen that each genus of Mysidee that we record, has its own modification of
this system; except Schistomysis, which is inseparable from such Macromysis as
M. inermis, and there are grave doubts of the validity of Schistomysis. Tt was
separated from the old genus Mysis, chiefly on account of the long bifid appendage
on its fourth abdominal segment in the male. If only females are taken, it is difficult
to refer them to this genus. Further, since a similarly modified male appendage
occurs on the fourth segment in emimysis, it would appear that even this character
is not peculiar to Schistomysis. In fact, the division of many old genera into new
ones, and the validity of critical species, are often based on characters of sex or on
points that may change during the growth of an individual as much as they may
differ in two specimens of the same age.

In place of these variable characters, or in addition to them, we suggest that
the study of the chromatophore-system may give results more easily recorded and
more soundly based. The form of the centre-system in which we find generic
characters, and the details of this and of the branch-systems which define the
species, are characters that arise early in life, are constant in both sexes, and persist
unchanged.

As an example of the constancy of this centre- and branch-system, we may refer to
