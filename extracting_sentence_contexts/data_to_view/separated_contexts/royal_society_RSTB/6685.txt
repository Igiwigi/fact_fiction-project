1. SECTIONS BETWEEN WISBECH AND THE FEN MARGIN

In shallow coastal bays or wide estuaries, such as the fenland basin, it is clear that the
relative movement of land and sea may have had very great influence on the course of
peat formation. In such an area the seaward deposits will tend to be silts and clays and
the landward deposits peat: during submergences the silts and clays will transgress
previously formed peats, and during emergence peat will extend seawards over the
silts and clays. Thus an alternate wedging out of silts and clays on the one side and of
peats on the other is to be expected, and this is, in fact, realized. We can cite in con-
firmation the figure by Wildfang (fig. 20) of a schematic section through the east
Friesian marshes between Dollart and the Ley Bucht. Landwards there is only one
peat bed, seawards there are two, separated and overlaid by marine deposits, and at
places between, there may be four or five peat beds.
