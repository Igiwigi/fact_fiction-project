tonic contyaction of this sphincter is maintained, and secondly, the contraction of the
walls of the duct and gall-bladder. The cystic duct in Man is always somewhat
tortuous wt its commencement, and this may furnish an explanation of the fact that
very considerable manual pressure is required to expel ths contents of the gall
bladder, at all events, after death, and at the same time suggests that the muscular
contraction by which the hile is normally expelled is of a gradual and peristaltic
character, Moreover, the tortuosity of the cystic duet may have some physiological
significance in the sense that it acts as a valve and prevents mere abdominal pressure
from producing a flow of bile into the intestine,

The air-bladder and pneumatic duct certainly exhibit some structural analogies ta
the gall-bladder and eystie duct, and it is by no means improbable that a close
physiological parallelism may also exist with regard to the expulsion of their respec
tive contents. It is true that.the walls of the air-bladder are devoid of both intrinsi¢
and extrinsic muscles, and they can haye no power of expelling the gases they enclose
