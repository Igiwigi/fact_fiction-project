By choosing the zero phase ¢ =0 as the reference phase, uj(¢) is given by a
transformation of uj(0) with the matrix 5) common to all /:

u(¢) = $(¢)u;(0). (3.15)

Clearly, there is also a corresponding relation for the left-eigenvectors:

uf (¢) = uj (0)S-"(¢). (3.16)


It can also be shown by differentiating the solution p(¢) that the Jacobian L@) is related to A(0)
through

In the past, Method II was not formulated for multi-oscillator systems except for oscillatory
reaction—diffusion systems; space-discrete systems such as networks and populations of
oscillators were carefully avoided [7]. In discrete systems, the pair coupling, which has to be
treated as a perturbation, depends on the two-state vectors of the coupled pair like V(X, X’). This
fact seemed to make it difficult to treat the problem formally as a one-oscillator problem. As we
see later in this section, this seeming difficulty can be circumvented easily. However, before going
into this problem, we begin with an easier case to treat, because the formulation is almost the
same as for discrete systems except for one essential point.
