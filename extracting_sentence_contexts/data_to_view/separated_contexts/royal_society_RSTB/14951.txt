The advancing data frontier is still
noticeable, in that there are several commonly acknowledged data problems that remain at the spatial-social interface. Most
notably, spatial data are commonly used to answer social questions: proximity is used to detect or approximate social interac-
tions, either using direct censuses (e.g. [15]) or remote biologging and telemetry (e.g. [24]). The approach of using spatially
explicit data to answer social questions provides a useful workaround to the fact that social interactions can be more difficult to
detect than collocations in space, but this approach is still afflicted with problems such as missingness in the data. Regardless,
we are optimistic that missing data is not an insurmountable obstacle for spatial-social interface studies. There exist no ‘perfect’
systems in which there are no missing individuals either in the social or the spatial realms, although ATLAS or other reverse
GPS methods might offer promising future opportunities.
