The model
predictions for both systems (PS/PVME and PS/PPO) are derived by fitting to blend PVT data
(parameters available in Tambasco (2006, tables 4.6 and 4.7)), and, in both cases, datasets for
mass fractions of 30/70 and 70/30 were used (Zoller & Walsh 1995).

inherent in such experiments and data analysis. The theoretical predictions are
shown by the curves; in each case the entire parameter set (including g) was
determined by fitting to the blend PVT surface. The theory not only captures
he exothermic nature of mixing in both cases, which is to be expected for
such blends, but in fact appears to provide a ‘home’ for the extremely noisy
experimental data. This analysis gives confidence that the theory will lead to a
deeper understanding of the contributing factors to blend miscibility in systems
‘or which data are scarce. Figure 6 focuses on the volume change on mixing for the well-characterized
lend PS/PVME.
