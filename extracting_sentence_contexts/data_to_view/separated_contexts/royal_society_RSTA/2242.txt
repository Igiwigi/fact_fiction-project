Rather, as approaches to the discrete simulation of fluid now enter a
vigorous maturity, we believe that a new synthesis best describes their place
in computational fluid dynamics. Despite their many merits, discrete simulation
methods are obviously not a panacea. In fact, many notions and concepts from

PDE discretization have proven extremely valuable in boosting their quality
and overall performance, a statement that is particularly true for the widely
popular Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, de facto a powerful blend of particle
and grid methods. This Theme Issue provides the reader with a record of the state of the art
in the field and contains a wide range of contributions, covering many aspects
relevant to the physics of complex flows, across many scales of motion and type
of applications. This Theme Issue is specifically devoted to applications of discrete simulation

methodologies.
