blue is for a=0.01. In the language of the theory of singularities, the effect of ea £0 is to unfold
the pitchfork bifurcation. A local analysis near the bifurcation point at t=e7! similar to the
one in [45] indicates that the upper and lower branches are stable while the middle branch is
unstable for t > 1/e. From (3.13), we note that the speed c approaches constant values as t + 00
given by
Coo =—3e(a+n)>0 and Coo =—3e(a— 7) <0. (3.14)

There are two important results that are worth stressing. First, since we take n = —1 here, the two
upper branches (c > 0) are coming closer together as a > 1 (figure 6c). Furthermore, their left limit
point moves to large t in the same limit a 1. Consequently, if a > 1, the lower branch (c < 0) is
the only branch of solutions. We conclude that a front that is too asymmetric may only be observed
to be propagating in one direction (i.e. one specific sign of c). The delayed feedback then speeds
up the front in that same direction. Second, the fact that the speed approaches constant values as
tT — oo implies that we may replace u(z + ct) in equation (3.12) by its asymptotic limit for z large,
ie. u=1. The reduced problem then becomes an ordinary differential equation which is easier to
solve. Using (3.12) with u(z + cr) = 1 we found analytically the correct speed limits.

The final example we discuss is again motivated by simple bistable models in neurobiology.
The following equation exhibits a delayed threshold nonlinearity:

up = —u + H(u(t — t) — a) + Uxx, (3.15)

and has been investigated in [46]. Here, H(i) denotes the Heaviside function, and the function
H(u — a) — u can be seen as a piecewise linear version of a cubic polynomial with zeros at 0 and
1 (figure 7a). The advantage of using piecewise linear functions is that this approach allows one
