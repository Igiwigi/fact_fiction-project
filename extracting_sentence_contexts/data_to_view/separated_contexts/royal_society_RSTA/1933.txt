The following will, I think, show that no error need be feared in the solution which
has just been obtained. The value of V,, if obtained accurately, ought to satisfy V’°V; = —4zp, and the term
—4rp must come entirely from the terms independent of ¢ in V, Thus the terms in
V, which are multiplied by e, ¢? and e* ought separately to be spherical harmonics. It was verified in the previous paper that the terms in e and e* were in actual
fact of this form, The terms in e* will be harmonic if the quantity on the right of
equation (57) is harmonic, and the conditions for this are expressed by the equations

I have inserted the values just obtained for ty, t», ...0;, ... in these equations, and
have verified that they are all satisfied. (The necessary transformations of the various
integrals are tedious, but involve no special difficulties.)
