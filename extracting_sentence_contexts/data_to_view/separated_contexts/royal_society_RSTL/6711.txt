In the following Table we give the results of such a calculation with those specimens
of iron the conducting-powers of which do not yary more than 20 per cent. from that
deduced for the pure metal,

The reason for making the above deduction will be fully explained in our paper © On
Q the Influence of Temperature on the Flectric Conducting-power of Alloys.” One glance,
NA however, will show that the deduced values agree as well together as can be expected,
5 considering that the results may be modified by the presence of carbon, snIphur, &c. Z In cases where we may assume that we have only solutions of one metal in another, the
5 concordance in the deduced yalues is very great; in fact, when we experiment with
DP metals whose conducting-power in a pure state is known, and when the impurity 1s
Sonly dissolved in it, then the deduced conducting-power agrees almost exactly with
= that found experimentally.
= For resistance-thermometers, as described by S1eEMENS®, the use of an iron wire would
give much greater differences for the same increment of temperature than copper; for
© the resistance of pure copper wire increases for each degree about 0:4 per cent., whereas
3 that of pure iron increases about 0-6 per cent. for each degree. S When we found that iron decreased in conducting-power between 0* and 100* more
S than the pure metals (and here again we will call attention to the fact that we have
= as yet found no alloy to decrease in conducting-power between 0? and 100? to a greater
= extent than that which the pure metals composing it would do), we thought that its
S being a magnetic body might poxsibly be the reason of it ; but after having tested
= thallium, and found that the conducting-power of that metal also decreases more than
YZ that of the pure metals, we knew that this could not well be the case, for thallium is
E strongly diamagneticf, Hearing, however, that Professor W6nLER possessed specimens
S of pure cobalt and nickel wire prepared by M. DeviLLe, we wrote and asked him to lend
them to us; this he immediately did, and on testing them we obtained the following
