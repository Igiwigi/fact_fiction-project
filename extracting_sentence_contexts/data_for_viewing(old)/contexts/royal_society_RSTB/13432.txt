1. Introduction

Phenotypic variation fuels the successful response of organisms to environ-
mental challenges, and a lack thereof would thus seem to be a universal
obstacle for introductions of species to new habitats [1,2]. The dilemma results
from the fact that species are generally thought to be introduced to new ranges
by only limited numbers of individuals and, therefore, to undergo genetic bottle-
necks characterized by reduced genetic variation (and presumably phenotypic
variation) compared to their native range. This type of bottleneck is expected
to result in inbreeding depression and decreased evolutionary potential, present-
ing a ‘genetic paradox’ for understanding the successful plant invaders and their
adaptation to new habitats [2,3].

Our understanding of the importance of genetic bottlenecks is rooted in the
modern synthesis of evolutionary theory, which asserts that genes (defined
by DNA sequence) are the sole source of heritable phenotypic variation, and
that inheritance of environmentally induced non-genetic variation is impossible
[4-7]. The recovery of genetic variation has, therefore, long been considered an
