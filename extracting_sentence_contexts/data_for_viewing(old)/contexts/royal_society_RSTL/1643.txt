I $hall give an instance. The substance which has been called
the white oxide of manganese is a compound of water and the


of Phosphorus and Sulphur, &c. 415

protoxide of manganese, and when heated strongly, it gives off
its water and becomes a dark olive oxide.

It has been often suspected, that the contraction of volume
produced in the pure earths by heat, is owing to the expulsion
of water combined with them. The following fact seems to
confirm this suspicion, and off-rs a curious phenomenon.

Zircona, precipitated from its solution in muriatic acid by an
alkali, and dried at a temperature below goo?, appears as a white
powder, 80 soft as not to scratch glass. When heated to
noo? or 800?, water is suddenly expelled from it, and notwith-
standing the quantity of vapour formed, it beco:nes at the
moment red hot. After the process, it is found harsh to the
feel, has gained a tint of gray, its parts cohere together, and it
is become $0 hard as to scratch quartz.
