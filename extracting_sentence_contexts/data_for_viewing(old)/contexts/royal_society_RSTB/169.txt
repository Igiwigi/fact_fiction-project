passing through the organ in the direction of the shock. With weaker galvanic
currents or currents of long duration after-effects are produced which are opposed
in direction to the experimental current,

The influence of the organ upon the experimental current itself’ is very surprising,
for it would appear that the organ is a better conductor for ‘‘ homodromous” than it
is for “ heterodromous ” currents. This remarkable fact is not, according to pu Bors-
Reymonp, due to the development of an excitatory change which adds to the amount
of one current whilst it diminishes that of the one oppositely directed ; it can therefore
only be called, for want of intelligible physical explanation, a case of “ irreciprocal
conduction.”

He states further that both facts are of great teleological importance, since they show
that the shock of the organ, instead of being weakened by polarisation in the tissue,
will be strengthened by the production of an after-effect in the same direction as
itself, and that the organ is of such a character as to distinctly disfavour any short-
circuiting of the current present in one column by its neighbour. ‘To quote his own
words, “the organ is not insulated, but the irreciprocal conduction which we have
recognised performs, as has been already stated, a function similar to complete
insulation. Each column conducts its own homodromous current comparatively
well, but bars the passage to the heterodromous current threads of all the other
columns ; and, as this is the same for all the columns, the heterodromous current threads
are forced to take the circuitous route round the edges of the organ, just as if the

organ consisted of a non-conducting substance” (19),
