I will here state that, acting with the electric current upon the nerves of living
warm-blooded animals, as rabbits and dogs, a phenomenon analogous to that which
we have studied in the frog is very clearly seen to follow the action of the inverse
current ; only it is observa√æble that in these animals the tetanic contractions last a
much shorter time, especially if the vitality of the animal is very great; the same
fact besides is verified in the frog.

How is this tetanic action produced ? It is easy to convince oneself, if any doubt
could be entertained upon the subject, that there is no electricity rendered latent
either in the nerves or in the muscles by the passage of the inverse current. My
endeavours to discover signs of any, by the aid of the condenser, have been entirely
fruitless. Likewise there are no signs on opening the circuit of any electric current
in circulation. I have made myself quite certain of this fact by means of the galya-
nometer, employing at the same time a pile of tetanized frogs.

The phenomenon which we have studied thus at length belongs clearly to the
nerve, and takes its origin from the relation, the nature of which is yet undetermined,
which exists between neryous influence and the action of the electric current accord-
ing to the direction of the Jatter.

It has been distinctly proved in the fourth series of these electro-physiological
researches, that the passage of the direct current destroys the excitability of the
nerve, and that this is not the case with the inverse current, which acts in a contrary
