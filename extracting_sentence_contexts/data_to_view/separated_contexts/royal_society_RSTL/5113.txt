Now St. Helena and the Cape of Good Hope,
Situated near together, are unlike magnetically, as well as in geographical position,
to either Toronto or Hobarton ; and I am desirons, in addition to presenting an
investigation into the periodical character of the laws of disturbance operating at
the new stations, to point out in what respect the character agrees, and in what it
differs, from that which has been found at Toronto and Hobarton. We may expect, from facts already known, some agreement in the amount of
disturbance in the same years at different places. Table I. exhibits the ratios of the
numbers and aggregate values of the disturbed observations in the different years to
the average annual number and aggregate value, alsÂ» the average value of one
disturbance in each year.
