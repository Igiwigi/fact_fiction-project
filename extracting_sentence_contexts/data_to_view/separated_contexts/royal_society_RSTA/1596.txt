Solutions satisfying (1.2) are called intermediate
solutions. This terminology originates from the corresponding continuous case and is due to the
fact that, when (1.1) is satisfied, any non-oscillatory solution x of (P) satisfies either limy xn = lx 4
0, or (1.2), or limy Xn = 0, lim, xl = â€”lx, 0 < ty < 00, see [3,4]. The investigation of intermediate
solutions is a hard problem, due to difficulties in finding suitable sharp upper and lower bounds
for these solutions, see e.g. [5, p. 241] and [6, p. 3], in which these facts are pointed out for the
continuous case. In the half-linear case the problem of the existence of intermediate solutions has been
completely solved by the following. Theorem 1.1.
