Air, or Carbonic Acid. By George Pearson, M. D. F.R.S.

F ROM a Paper read to the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh,
in 1755, published in the second volume of the Physical and
Literary Essays, Doctor BLAck appears to have discovered the
affinities between an acriform substance, which he called fired
air, and alkalies, quick-lime, and magnesia. His experiments
'also shewed, that many properties of these bodies depended
upon the union and separation of this air. The discovery of
these facts established this elastic fluid to be a peculiar species
of substance.

Mr. CavenDisn, Dr. BRowNR166, Dr. PRIESTLEY, Sir TorR-
BERN BERGMAN, Mr. BEWLEY, Mr. K1Rwan, and other che-
mists, afterwards extended, very considerably, the history of
fixed air. The question, whether it was a simple or compound
body, was discussed ; and by many persons it was believed to have
been proved, that fixed air was.composed of phlogiston and re-
spirable air. But some of the principal facts, upon which this
belief was founded, being afterwards demonstrated to be erro-
neous ; and the production of fixed air being, to the apprehen-
sion of many chemists, more satisfactorily accounted for by the
