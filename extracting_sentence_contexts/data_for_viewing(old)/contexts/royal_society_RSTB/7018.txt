Since the nature and mode of distribution of nutrients to the growing region seem likely

â€œto be important factors in morphogenetic processes, the problem under consideration is
one which deserves further attention. With modifications the experimental method used
here affords a means of obtaining data relating to the quantitative aspect; this is now being
investigated.


372 CG. W. WARDLAW ON THE SHOOT APEX OF DRYOPTERIS

In relation to the experimental procedure, metabolic and mechanical factors are modified
and important morphological changes result. The growing region, in fact, shows con-
siderable diversity in its morphogenetic activity. This is true of the lateral segments as well
as of the isolated meristem. During normal growth at the apex, pressures and tensions
are developed between the several enlarging tissue systems. As Priestley (1928) pointed out,
the slowly growing incipient vascular tissue tends to be compressed between the more
rapidly enlarging parenchymatous cells of the pith and cortex. Moreover, the existence
of different rates of growth in adjacent tissues results in the development of tensile stresses
in the more slowly growing tissue (Wardlaw 1944, 19452). The present studies have yielded
evidence of the importance of this mechanical factor in morphogenesis. If the configuration
of the incipient vascular tissue is, at least in part, determined by the pressure exerted on
it by the rapidly growing medullary and cortical parenchyma, then it might be anticipated
that, in the lower part of an isolated terminal region of square outline, the vascular tissue
would also have a square outline; and so on for terminal regions of triangular outline, etc.
