Conclusion

We employed MD simulations to study the behaviour of methane dissolved in water confined
within silica, alumina and MgO pores with 1 nm width. The methane solubility in confined water
in the silica pore is much higher than that found in the two other pores at comparable T and P. This is due to the fact that the hydrated silica pore is less ‘hydrophilic’ than the other two pores
considered. Despite the fact that the hydrated alumina pore is slightly more hydrophilic than
the hydrated MgO pore, methane solubility in water confined in the alumina pore is slightly
larger than that obtained in the MgO pore. This difference is probably due to higher tangential
pressure expected in the alumina pore.
