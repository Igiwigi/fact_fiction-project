by means of the blood, which may be considered as the carrier of this stimu-
Jus, as it is of temperature and nutriment, to the various parts of the system.
As oxygen is the principal stimulus, the heart is the principal organ of irrita-
bility, in all the yertebrated animals ; if the contact of oxygen be interrupted,
all perish in a greater or less period of time.

The extraordinary differences which exist in animals which occupy different
stations in the zoological scale, have long excited the attention of naturalists.
Nor have the differences which obtain in the various ages and states of its
existence, in the same animal, escaped the attention of the physiologist. A
sImilar remark applies to that singular state of existence and of the functions
of life, designated hybernation. But it appears to me that a sufficiently com-
prehensive view has not been taken of the subject, and that many facts, with
their multitudinous relations, still require-to be determined.

The principal of these facts is that of the quantity of respiration. This is
greater in proportion as the animal occupies a higher station in the zoological
scale, being, among the vertebrated animals, greatest of all in birds, and lowest
in fishes; the mammalia, the reptiles, and the amphibia occupy intermediate
Stations. The quantity of respiration is also remarkably low in the very
