PERSISTENCE OF PUTREFACTIVE AND INFECTIVE ORGANISMS, 189

800n cease to be equal in vigour, The life of the one is promoted, the life of the other
only tolerated by its environment. When the temperature gurrounding both is raised
to a prejudicial height the one will suffer more than the other, because equally inclement
conditions are brought to bear upon constitutions of different strengths ; and if the
temperature be sufficiently exalted or sufficiently prolonged to become fatal, the more
weakly organism will be the first to give way. A germ, moreover, brought close to the
death-point in a neutral or an alkaline infusion may revive, while in an acid one it
may perish—just as proper nutriment may rescue a dying man while improper
nutriment would fail to do 80. These elementary considerations, founded on the
demonstrable fact that Bacteria-germs are more fully vivitied and better nourished in
neutral infusions than in acid ones, suffice, I think, to explain the observed difference
of action. At all events, these are the thoughts which have become rooted in my mind,
through long observation and long pondering of this question *.

8 21. Remarks on the Germs of Bacteria as distinguished from Bacteria themselves.

The failure to distinguish between these stubborn germs and the soft and sensitive
organisms which spring from them has been a fruitful source of error in writings
on Biogenesis. In his able and important paper, * On the Origin and Distribution of
Bacteria in Water, and the circumstances which determine their existence in the 'Tissues
and Liquids of the Living Body,” Dr. Buxbox SANDERS0N, for example, has described
experiments from which, in my opinion, very incorrect conclusions have been drawn,
