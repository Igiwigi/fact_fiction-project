It
is obvious that such a substance as this would be called a solid in ordinary parlance,
and in the tidal problem this must be regarded as a rather small viscosity. Ti 8eems to me, then, that we have only got to postulate that the upper and cool
gurface of the earth pregents such a difference from the interior that it yields with
extreme glowness, if at all, to the weight of continents and mountains, to admit the
Possibility that the globe on which we live may be like that here treated of. If,
therefore, astronomical facts should confirm the argument that the world has really
gone through changes of the kind here investigated, I can se no adequate reason for
agguming that the whole process was pre-geological. Under these circumstances it
must be admitted that the obliquity to the ecliptic is now probably slowly decreasing;
