which can be approximately evaluated as 7°/6(k7)?.d log N(E)/dE (Mott and Jones
1936, p. 178). At the value £,,, our experimental curves show that N, , ,(Z) is increasing
and N,(E) decreasing with Z, and, although probably the former predominates in
N(E), this is not certain. But in any case, the slopes of the observed curves at the
values E,, give only shifts of the edges of the order of 107% eV at 300° A.

We think, therefore, that the effect can only be explained as a modification in the
form of the N(E) curve for a band when the lattice constant is altered. All the metals
dealt with (except possibly Li) have, at liquid oxygen temperature, the property that
an overlap of Brillouin zones occurs within a few tenths of an eV of the edge. One
possibility is that this overlap might disappear, or become changed in amount, with
increasing temperature; and indeed there is a certain amount of evidence, which,
though not conclusive, points to the fact that this may be the case, at least for Na
and Al. For a reference to figure 4 will show that the kinks in the observed intensity
curves which occur near to the edges are obliterated at the highest temperatures,
and, though one cannot be quite sure, it seems that this obliteration is more than one
could expect from the mere diffuseness of the edge. In the case of Na, the upturned
portion near to the edge which represents the Brillouin zone overlap has an area of
perhaps @y of that of the whole band at 110° A. If, therefore, at 300°, the zone overlap
has disappeared, the width of the band would be extended towards higher energies
by an amount of about ;}5 of the actual band width, say about 0-03 eV. This would
be of the required order of magnitude in order to account for the discrepancies
between the observed and calculated values in table 4.
