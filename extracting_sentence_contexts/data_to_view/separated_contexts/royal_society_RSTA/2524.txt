The values in the second column have been
obtained from GALE and ADAmsâ€™ main series of measurements at nine atmospheres. It will be observed that the values given in the last column are, on the average,
higher than the other two. This is to be expected from the fact that all the lines
referred to are reversed in the arc under eleven-atmospheres pressure, but bright in
the spark under the present experimental conditions. It has been foundt that if a
line is reversed at a given pressure its shift is very much smaller than when it is
unreversed.
