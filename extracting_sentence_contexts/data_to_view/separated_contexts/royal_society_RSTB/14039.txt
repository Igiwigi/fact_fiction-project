While we observed the evolution of

will be less effective in general, and in the major arrangement balanced lethals when mutations were not fully recessive,


the likelihood of observing this outcome was reduced relative
to simulations with fully recessive mutations. This is because
partially recessive deleterious mutations (i.e. 0<h<0.5) are
expressed in the heterokaryotype, reducing AOD and desta-
bilizing the polymorphism. By contrast, the presence of GC
did not seem to affect the outcome in line with the fact that
it had little impact on AOD overall. The generality of these
effects will need to be tested using a wider range of
parameter values. For the balanced lethal systems that have been described,
the genetic content of the supergene is not yet known
10-12,15,16,59,60].
