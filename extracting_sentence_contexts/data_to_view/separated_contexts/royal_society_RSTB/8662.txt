Any measurement of the
scattered radiation from a sample, such as X-ray diffraction from a protein crystal,
requires an adequate exposure for that recording. The energy transfer into the
sample during that exposure depends on the atomic cross sections for photo-
absorption relative to those for elastic scattering. The ratio of scattering to
absorption cross sections can be varied only by a change in wavelength, and
there is no way to avoid the fact that for every scattered X-ray photon there
are many more photons absorbed by the sample. Up until recently, the most suc-
cessful way to work within this fundamental constraint has been to grow large
well-diffracting crystals that yield strong diffraction within the damage-limited
exposure. Cryogenic cooling of the sample reduces some of the reactions that
occur subsequently to photoabsorption allowing for about a 30-50 times increase
in exposure [2-4].
