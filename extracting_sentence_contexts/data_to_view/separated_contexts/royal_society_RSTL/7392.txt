The like

notion of compoxition applies to relations in general ; viz., the compound relation is a

relation satisfied if, and not satisfied unless one or the other of the two component rela-

tions is satisfied. TI purposely refrain at present from any further discusson of the
S theory of composition. I say that the conditions for the existence of given systems of
S equalities between the roots of an equation furnish instances of 8uch composition ; in
2 fact, if we express that the function (*Xz, y)", and its first-derived function in regard to 7,
= or, what is the same thing, that the first-derived functions in regard to @, y respectively,
S have a common quadric factor, we obtain between the coefficients a certain twofold rela-
Z tion, which implies either that the equation (*Lz, y)"=0 has three equal roots, or else
S that it has two pairs of equal roots ; that is, the relation in question is satisfied if, and
= it is not satisfied unless there is satisfied either the relation for the existence of three
<< equal roots, or els6 the relation for the existence of two pairs of equal roots; or the
EB relation for the existence of the quadric factor is compounded of the last-mentioned two
S relations. The relation for the quadric factor, for any value whatever of n, is at once
S een to be expressible by means of an oblong matrix, giving rise to a series of deter-
8 minants which are each to be put =0; the relation for three equal roots and that for
two pairs of equal roots, in the particular cages n=4 and n=5, are given in my * Memoir
