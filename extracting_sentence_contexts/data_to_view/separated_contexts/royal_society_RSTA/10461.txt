For,
in this case, the only other term which might be considered first in the asymptotic
expansion of the quotient is (—)?*'pb, 2?-*” log z, which, since ¢, is positive, is of
lower order than

§ 74. It is now evident that, if we are given any simple function of finite integral
order, we can find its asymptotic expansion. The analysis just given solves
completely the case of algebraical zeros, When the zeros are not algebraic we may,
and, in fact, we shall have to introduce new analytical functions defined as indefinite
integrals ; but there will be no essential difference in the theory. 5

It should be noticed that just as we have to take the principal values of the
algebraically many-valued expressions which occur in the asymptotic approximation
for functions of non-integral order, so we must assign principal values to the
logarithms which occur when the functions are of integral order. Part IV. The Asymptotic Expansion of Repeated Integral Functions.
