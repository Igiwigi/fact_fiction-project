It resembles the stele of a root, but is simpler, and is
Sounded by a fairly regular sheath of large cells, This sheath was recognisable by
he dense protoplasmic contents of its cells, and may be compared with an endodermis
Since the roots appear to take origin from it. Between the sheath and the tracheides
Bure smaller cells with thin walls. This tissue in part corresponds to phloem, so far
â€œas its position in the strand and the fact that it is composed of elongated elements
ee concerned, Sieve tubes have, however, not been recognised in it. Tn the above instances, the vascular strand may be fairly termed a stele, although
le existence of phloem has not been established. In other processes the structure

simpler.
