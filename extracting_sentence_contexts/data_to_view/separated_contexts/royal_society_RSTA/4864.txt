Here is an equivalent formulation. The sheaf F @ FY = End(F) has a direct sum decomposition

End(F) = Qe @ End°(F),

in which End°(F) is the subsheaf of endomorphisms of trace zero. The fact that M1,1(F_) =1 is
thus equivalent to

2n
YO 1) Trace(Frobe, |Hi(AZ. , End°(F))) = 0.

Lemma 6.1. The cohomology groups FAS End*(F)) all vanish. Proof.
