It is important to note that there is a difference
from the theoretical prediction (black line) in terms of both elevation (axial depth of cut) and
‘resonances’ (natural frequencies). Both can be explained by the change of the dynamics during
cutting compared to the non-operating (tap tested) case. In fact, for the SM set-up a dummy tool
was shot by softball and measured by a laser displacement sensor in order to estimate varying
dynamics during spindle rotation (without cutting). Modifying functions were used for w,,x(1)
and ¢() accordingly [53] (figure 3c). In the industrial (HT) case, up milling (UM) chatter tests were performed at a chosen spindle
speed only, in order to provide validation of theoretical stability analysis for each ram position.
