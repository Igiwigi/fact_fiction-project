We are inclined to attribute most of the small effects observed
$0 the residual sources of uncertainty, contact action, imperfect shielding, imperfect
Gnsulation, imperfect prevention of the creeping of the charge, in spite of these
“pffects having been eliminated apparently before the sulphur condenser was inserted. Because these uncertainties are suggested, it must not be thought that they were
-@verlooked at the time. We believe that everything was done that could be done,
gind that we are, in fact, at about the limit of the applicability of these methods. ‘2 However, taking the numbers as they stand, they are sufficiently remarkable, and
“Show that the residual charge, if it exists, is less than, say, four parts in ten thousand
ef the original charge, even when the duration of charge amounts to ten minutes. ‘2In our previous experiments using the film between the old gilded plates, we made
-guse of enormously greater voltages derived from an electrophorus, but some uncertainty
arose from the possible parting of the plates, and from the burning of the film where
athe spark had jumped across.
