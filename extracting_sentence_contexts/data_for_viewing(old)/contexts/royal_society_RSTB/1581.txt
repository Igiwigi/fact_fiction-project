Of the 1emaining species of Moerones recorded in the * British Museum Catalogue,’
wé have examined ithe following :-—IL plameeps, WM. nigriceps, M, gniie, IM. tengara,
M. Wolffit, UM. micracanthus, M. Hoevenii, and M. aor. We also dissected a species
labelled M, armatus,* bat which we were unable to identify with certainty as belonging
to any of the species referred to in the * British Museum Catalogue,’ or elsewhere.
With the exeeption of the last-mentioned, the locality of which was unknown, all
these species are East Indian, collectively ranging from India eastwards through
Burniwh, Siam, Java, Sumatra, and Borneo.

With the exeeption of Macrones aor the variations met with in the stracture ot
the air-bladder ave perhaps of no great importance, but uevertheless merit a brief
reference from the fact that they illustrate the natnre and extent of the modifications
that may ocewr in the normal species of the same genus, and Mieronex is one of the
very few genera of which we have been able to examine a fairly representative series
of species,

M. planiceps and M. armutus very closely resemble M. nenwwrus. The same remark
applies also to MW. nigriceps, M. gulio, M. tengaro, and I Wolffii, except that the
lateral compartwents of the sir-bladder in these species have comparatively undivided
cayities, there being but slight rudiments of two or three secondary transyerse septa.
in each, The post-temporal plates may also vary slightly in the depth of their
posterior concavities. In M. micracentiaus all traces of secondary trmsyerse septa
have entively disappeared. In M, tengara the lateral cutaneous areas ure rendered
very evident externally by cireular patches of black pigment, and, as Gtormen (15)
