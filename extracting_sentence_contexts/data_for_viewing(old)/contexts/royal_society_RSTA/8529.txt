§21. Transformation of Harmonie Series for Unequal Spheroids.

In order to obtain solutions of problems involving two—or more—parallel co-axial
dises of unequal radii, or more generally, two or more unequal spheroids with congruent
major axes, belonging to confocal systems with different line constants, it is necessary
to obtain a formula by which to transform the product P,, (u’) ¢, (¢’) to a summation of

the form
Ea,P,, (“) pn(S)

where (#, ¢), (u’, ¢’) are spheroidal co-ordinates with different origins (¢ = 0, 2 = — e)
and different radii (a, b) of confocality. Two such transformations are, in fact, needed,
according to whether the new origin is beyond or behind the old, along the positive
direction of the z-axis. We may designate these the forward and backward transforma-
tions respectively. he results are generalisations of formule earlier in this memoir,
and their derivation will be set out somewhat briefly, for no essentially new features are
introduced.

If there are two systems of spheroidal co-ordinates («’, ¢’), (, ¢), of origins O,, O, at
the points z = — c, z = 0 on the axis of z, and limiting line-constants (a, b) respectiv ely,
we have for any external point (2, ¢)

e=a/{(l—p?) (1 +62} =b./{(1 — uw) (1+ &)},
