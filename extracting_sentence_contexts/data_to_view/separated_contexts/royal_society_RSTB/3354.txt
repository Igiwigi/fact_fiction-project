Breeding Seasons.—In Table VI is recorded the dates each year when the
highest and lowest number of marriages, total births, and illegitimate births take
place, and under each heading white and coloured are entered separately. For both
races there is one period of the year when a specially high birth-rate always occurs,
namely, in July ; there is also a second period when a rise takes place in the birth-
rate, as a rule only slightly marked, but in 1905 strongly marked, namely,
November—December. There are, in fact, two annual periods when most conceptions

occur, or two annual breeding seasons, the autumn and the spring breeding seasons,
giving rise to the high birth-rates in July and November—December respectively. In the case of both races the increased birth-rate is sudden and must coincide with
a sudden burst of reproductive activity. For whites the seasons are somewhat more sharply marked than for coloured.
