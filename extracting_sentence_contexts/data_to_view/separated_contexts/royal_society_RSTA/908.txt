It would seem that the term (- Y a) is the measure of an outstanding

stress at the periphery. During acceleration from (55) y is positive and the outstanding
stress is a pressure, during retardation y is negative and the outstanding stress is a
traction. Qualitatively considered they would be precisely the types of stress required
to deal with a fictitious layer adhering to the surface to retain it in position during

motion. It is now necessary to enquire the order of error likely to be introduced by neglect of

the term including the space variable. Rewrite (57) as

aby = KR, {1-4}

where the greatest value of h is unity, and

y=epHD Ry 2. - ee ee te (55)
