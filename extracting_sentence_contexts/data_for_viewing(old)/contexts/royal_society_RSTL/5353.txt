This I believe is the proper explanation of the fact of penetration by this body.
But although penetration be not caused by the endosmic action of the envelopes,

it may yet be thought to be induced by some attractive power in the substance of
the yelk itself; and that, therefore, the entrance of the spermatozoon may be as much
due to the egg as to any power of motion in the penetrating body. An accident has
enabled me to test the validity of this surmise.

I had promised to show the fact of penetration to a friend, but circumstances pre-
vented me from doing s0 until the season had nearly passed, and the whole of my
frogs had spawned. I determined therefore, as a last resource, to endeayour to ob-
tain some fecundatory fluid from a male which had already paired two or three days
previously, and to employ it with the only eggs I had then left, which remained in
the body of a frog that had been killed 72wenty-sir hours before, and which, as former
experiments had shown, it was probable bad lost their vitality. The fluid required was
obtained with ease, but mixed with a large quantity of spermatozoal cells. This was
supplied to some eggs from the dead frog, since, although I did not expect that the eggs
would be fecundated, I hoped for an opportunity of again witnessing the penetration
by the spermatozoon. The spermatozoa in the fluid obtained were very active, and
fully efficient, and were supplied in abundance to several eggs in separate cells under
the microscope. The envelopes of the eggs expanded as usual, and endosmosis went,
