compounded of a real and an apparent motion was also noticed by MrcyeL, who, in
a note to a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1767, remarked
that the apparent change of situation which has been observed in a few of the stars,
is a strong circumstance in favour of the opinion that those stars are among the
nearest to us; and that the apparent displacement may be owing either to a real mo-
tion of the stars themselves, or to that of the sun, or partly to the one and partly to
the other. And, he adds, * as far as it is owing to the sun's motion it may be re-
garded as a kind of secular parallax, which, if the annual parallax of a few of the
stars should some time or other be discovered, and the quantity and direction of the
sun's motion should be discovered also, might serve to inform us of the distance of
many of them, which it would be utterly impossible to find out by any other means.‚Äù

Lamserr's argument, that the fact of the sun's rotatory motion about its axis affords
a presumption of its translation in space, was adopted by LaLanps, who, in a memoir
presented to the Academy of Sciences of Paris in 1776, concludes that inasmuch as
the application of any force causing a body to turn about its centre cannot. fail to
displace the centre, the sun must necessarily have a real motion in absolute space.
This argument will not be allowed to have much weight when it is considered that
the sun's rotatory motion may, and probably does, proceed from causes wholly dif-
ferent from an eccentric impulsion.

Whatever degree of probability such & priori considerations may be supposed to
give to the hypothesis of the sun's proper motion, it is evident that something more
is necessary to render the hypothesis of any practical importance. The first astro-
nomer who attempted to prove the existence of the sun's motion from observations,
