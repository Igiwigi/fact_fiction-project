In this study, we introduce two interpretability frameworks, specifically designed for DNNs
trained for the ECG classification task, that let us inspect the decision of DNNs, unveiling which
waves of the input ECG were most relevant to the final classification. In this work, we refer to the
P-wave, QRS complex and T-wave composing the ECG beat as simply ‘waves’. The rationale
behind the development of new interpretability frameworks in this context relies on the fact
that the evaluation of the interpretation itself is challenging with the current interpretability
methodologies. Indeed, such methodologies can highlight the most important samples of the ECG
contributing to the classification. However, understanding whether such samples are meaningful
for the cardiac abnormality to detect is not currently handled.
