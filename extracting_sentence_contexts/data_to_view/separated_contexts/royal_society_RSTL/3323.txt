which agrees very closely with the results of the second and third analyses, while
those of the first and fourth analyses oscillate on either side of the calculated num-
bers. We seem to be justified therefore in adopting this formula for the constitution
of the resin of opoponax, as it exists in the natural gum resin of commerce. In reference to the analyses 4 and 5 above given, I would draw attention to a fact
which may hereafter prove of consideraþle consequence when we come to consider
the rational constitution of the resins. It will be observed that, by an increase of
temperature, sufficient to produce partial decomposition, the carbon increases, while
the per centage of oxygen decreases almost in equal proportion, that of the hydrogen
remaining nearly constant. 'This was the case also as above shown with the resin of
retin-asphalt, and approximately also with that of ammoniac, and we shall have occa-
sion to make the same remark in regard to several other resins to be treated of in
the following sections.
