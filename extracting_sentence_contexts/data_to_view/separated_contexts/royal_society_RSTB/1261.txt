Such appearances suggest an approach to a
ed state of the sporangium, which, however, has not been found in any of
ts hitherto considered. The advantages of a partitioned condition, where
rangium is large, are plain enough ; not only would the nutritive surface
1@ the developing spore be enlarged, but mechanical strength would be
4 to the large developing sac, and, finally, while a single puncture of the large
sporangium by animal, or other agency, would probably destroy the
s of spores, if the sporangium were septate only one compartment would
t is clear then that where the size of sporangia is larger, the advantage of a
D condition will become greater. These considerations, together with the facts
From Isoetes, suggest the question whether such partitioned sporangia of the
adinous type occur, and, if so, in what plants ¢

riking answer to this question is, T believe, to be found in a genus of
3 dineous affinity, in which the sporangium is extended in the radial direction. ave already noted fluctuations in this dimension within the genus Lycopodium
are figs. 36, 58, 73), while Jscetes in which the potential archesporium is
ly sterilized to form the trabeculz, is a still more pronounced example among
ants.
