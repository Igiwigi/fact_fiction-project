98 DR. T. WILLIAMS'S RESEARCHES ON THE STRUCTURE AND HOMOLOGY

The latter are more pear-shaped ; the former more umbrella- or fan-like. This difference
of figure, it will be afterwards proved, does not involve a difference of function. ,

The intermediate ciliated tubes (7, @) are specially distinguiahed only for their great
length and thickness. In all, the cilia at the free floating extremity of the organ beat
in such a manner as to raise a current setting strongly into the organs, and out of the
body of the animal. This fact is worthy of note. Tt proves that. neither the ova nor
the sperm-cells can escape through or along these ciliated tubes into the "cavity of the
body, supposing that in this Annelid, as in many others, they were destined at some
time to find their way into this chamber. But the author has convinced himself, by
recent, observations, that this never takes place in this genus. The general cavity is not
used at any time, or under any cireumstances, for the purpose of incubation.

The ciliated tubes of the generative organs, it must therefore be inferred, fulfil the
same office as those of the ordinary segmental organs ; that office is undoubtedly. to
discharge externally the fluid of the perigastric cavity. The current thus raised, in the
case of the special organs, serves also subsidiarily to convey outwards the generative pro-
ducts. The wider bore, more vigorous cilia, and stronger currents, are well adapted in
them for this purposeÂ®.
