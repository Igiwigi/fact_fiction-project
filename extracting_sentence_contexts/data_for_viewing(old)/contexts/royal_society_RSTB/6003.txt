482 J. L. SHELLSHEAR AND G. ELLIOT SMITH ON A COMPARATIVE

parative study shows that not only is there a general enlargement of the precentral
region in its lower part, but also that the inferior frontal region has expanded far ahead
of the condition in the apes. So that this new frontal cap might almost be regarded as
the cap of Broca. It will further be shown that this region is in all probability the
place where the first expansions of the frontal territory occur in response to the expan-
sions which we have already described in the parietal lobe. The superficial resemblance
then between the frontal cap in the apes—the so-called frontal cap of ANTHONy—and
the frontal cap in man is correlated with the fact that corresponding bony areas of the
skull in the apes do not in man cover homologous areas of brain.

The Cast of Sinanthropus Compared with that of Pithecanthropus.

Looked at as a whole the essential similarity of these two casts is at once apparent.
The contours of the two casts are placed horizontally 1 cm. apart; the basal contour
is drawn on the level of a line which cuts the cast posteriorly at the lowest point of the
groove between the occipital territory and the lateral sinus and anteriorly at a point
5 mm. above the lowest point of the frontal cap. Figs. 10 and 11 are very similar to
one another, the main difference being seen in the greater height of the cast of
Sinanthropus. The vertex in Pithecanthropus is flatter. This gives the cast a more
Squat appearance. Although the vertex in Sinanthropus is higher the difference in the
