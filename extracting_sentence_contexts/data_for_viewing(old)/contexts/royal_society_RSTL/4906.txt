propylene to appropriate reactions, other alcohols may be obtained homologous with
allyl-alcohol. This much is certain, that by distilling a mixture of cyanate of silver and
bromide of amylene, C,, Hy Br, a volatile liquid is obtained, which possesses an extremely
irritating odour, causing lacrymation like the cyanic ethers. 'This forms by contact
with ammonia a crystallizable urea, which, when decomposed by potassa, yields, like
cyanate of allyl, bases, among which the compound C,, H,, N may be traced.

Allylic alcohol, the history of which we have endeavoured to sketch, forms the third
term of a series of alcohols, which may be represented by the general formula

CaipO;:

In fact, a group of homologous acids is known, which, according to their compoxsition,
bear the same relation to acetic acid and its homologues, that is observed between out
new group of alcohols, and the alcohol-series commencing with methylic and ethylic
alcohols. In addition to acrylic acid, angelic and oleic acids are the best known terms
of this group of acids. Tt is possible that cyanide of ally], which is formed by the double
decompoxition of iodide of allyl and cyanide of silver, but which we have not yet beet
able to obtain in a state of sufficient purity to admit of analysis, may be transformed by
boiling with a solution of caustic potassa into an acid homologous with acrylic acid, =
the same way as cyanide of propyl is resolved under similar circumstances into butymc
acid.

We conclude this paper with a Table which exhibits in a perspicuous manner the two
groups of alcohols and acids.
