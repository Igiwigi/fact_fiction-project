There is probably also a double period in the frequency
of occurrence of the maxima, but the secondary maximum of frequency is very
small, and a longer period of years would be required to show the exact hour of its
occurrence at the different seasons,

Table XTX. is principally intended to bring out two facts: (1) that the hour of
most frequent occurrence of the daily maximum is earlier in years of sunspot
minimum than in years of maximum ; (2) that the distribution of maxima is more
concentrated, 7.e. less uniform throughout the 24 hours, in years of sunspot minimum
than in years of maximum. The phenomenon first mentioned is most conspicuous in
winter. As regards the second phenomenon, there is an apparent exception in
winter, the occurrences between midnight and 10 a.m, then diminishing slightly with
increased sunspot frequency.
