which we have employed for the determination of the blood volume agree. In
Table V we have collected together the rabbits in which the blood volume was
determined by washing out, and in Table VI the determinations by noting the
fall in heemoglobin after bleeding. The first group includes 12 experiments and the
second 10.

In Table V the average blood constant & is found to be 1°59, and in Table VI
1:57, which is only a difference of 1°26 per cent. between the two methods. It
is seen that the two methods, when properly carried out, give practically identical
results. On the other hand, the difference present tends to show that the blood
volume estimated by noting the fall of hemoglobin is about 1 per cent. larger than
that found by the washing-out method, which is, of course, what may be expected,
owing to the fact that small but negligible traces of blood necessarily remain within

the body in the latter method. It is clear that, if the bleeding method be carried
out, paying due attention to all the minute sources of error, it can yield absolutely
reliable results, and it is, moreover, a harmless method, which can be employed
upon living animals. But, as we have mentioned previously, it is not permissible to
use animals which have been bled before, as the method would then, in the majority
of cases, give erroneous results.
