Dr. AnpRaApr’s observations on lead (loc. cit.). We tried to fit the formula

S = S)-bat'+-bt

to Dr. ANDRADE’S observations, and the fit failed. The formula with » = 4, however,
fits Dr. ANDRADE’s observations very closely.

The results of a least-square fit to the observations of O,,, O,,, O,,, O,,, are given
below in Table VIII.

The probable divergence between the formula and the observations is here about
0-97, or about 0-1 per cent. of the observed values of 8. This is well within the prob-
able error of the observations themselves. In fact the fit is so close that the divergence
cannot be shown on a diagram drawn to a scale suitable for reproduction.
