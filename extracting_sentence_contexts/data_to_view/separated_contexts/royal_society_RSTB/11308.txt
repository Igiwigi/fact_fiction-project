In contrast to this, the FET model [36,37] uses the word ‘orien-
tation’ for novelty-related attention, attributed by both models
to the NE systems. Despite this difference in wording, both
models converge on the idea that ACh systems maintain
attention to established elements of situations, whereas NE sys-
tems regulate attention to novel aspects of situations as well as
many other behavioural sensitivity aspects. In fact, Posner &
Rothbart [20] themselves cited [56] study showing that antag-
onists to ACh block improvement from knowing where the
target would occur, but had no effect on RT improvement
from warning signals. Hasselmo & Stern [27] also mentioned
the well-known role of the ACh in the maintenance of attention. This consensus between Posner’s model and the FET model
suggests that there are neurochemical basis for differentia-
tion between orientational and attention-maintenance traits
of temperament.
