Jelly et al. [53] reported similar findings with their DNS results (figure 5c). In their work, the authors showed that the Reynolds stresses differed over the regions of slip
and no slip. In fact, they found that over 70% of the skin friction on the no-slip regions (solid
surface) was a direct result of the Reynolds stresses caused by the presence of the slip regions (air
pockets). Overall, computational studies conclude that turbulent drag reduction is possible when
streamwise slip outweighs spanwise slip, and hence experimentalists must fabricate SHSs with
geometries that favour streamwise slip.
