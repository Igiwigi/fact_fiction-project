is as real in the first case as in the second. Something more than orientation to external
agencies must surely be meant by the term ‘directional sense’ when, the less obvious the
external agency determining a given course, the more definite is the directional sense
inferred. This kind of directional sense seems meaningless except in relation to a postulated
distant goal, so that conscious self-direction seems to be clearly implied.

Theories of conscious self-direction invoke subjective forces as if they could take the place
of the objective ones that seem to be lacking. But subjective forces can never take the place
of objective ones. Conscious man himself is powerless to direct his movements without
reference to external features.

There is no choice, therefore, but to examine more closely the possibilities of orientation
by means of external features; and, in fact, a number of directed reactions to external
features are known in locust hoppers, or adults, or both. Williams (1930, 1949) has set aside
every reaction to external stimuli—except one—that has been suggested, or even demon-
strated to be concerned in the orientation of flying insects, on the grounds that none of
these external stimuli is constant enough to keep a migrant on a straight course over long
distances. The exception was the earth’s magnetic field, the possible orienting action of
which was investigated experimentally on locust hoppers by Cockbill (1942). The results
were negative, as the investigators rather expected. It seems premature to set the known
reactions aside in this way for two reasons. We have no evidence that migrants do hold
a straight course over long distances; and long-range movements can never be explained
except on the basis of the insects’ behaviour of which the known reactions form a significant
part, even if these reactions can never directly explain the long-range movements.
