In this way it has been found that the essential characters of the muscle curve are

not much affected by aldoxime. The primary and secondary curves continue to

possess their main features. This fact is brought out plainly in fig. 7, This tracing

shows the curve described by a muscle contraction after the muscle had been standing

33 minutes ina 2 per cent. solution of aldoxime. Fig. 6 shows the curve described

by the muscle of the opposite extremity of the same frog after standing the same

period in a 1 per cent. solution of aldoxime. They are both fairly normal tracings.
