This allowed us to derive a
few basic principles which led to designs with
improved flow patterns regarding the obstruction

hydrocephalus, ventricular catheters, pulsatile a pulsatile nature because of the heart beating and
flow, numerical simulations blood flow. To address this fact, here we extend

our previous computational study to models with
oscillatory boundary conditions. The new results will
be compared with the results for constant flows and
discussed. It turns out that the corrections due to the

reinforces our previous findings and conclusions.
