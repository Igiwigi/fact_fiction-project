of the septum to form a fibrous archway (Plate XITI. figs. 18, 21, 24, & 27, m), which

* The fibres of the external layers which enter into the formation of the fleshy pons, arise in many instances
from the root of the pulmonary artery and aorta, and from the anterior portion of the right auriculo-yentricular

opening,

separates the right auriculo-yentricular opening (7) from that of the pulmonary artery (Ã¾),
This fibrous archway has been appropriately denominated the fleshy pons, and is more
less spindle-shaped, from the fact of its forming the boundary between the auriculo-
ventricular and pulmonic orifices, the former of which is oval, the latter circular. It
varies in size according to the dimensions of the heart. In the sheep, calf (Plate XIV,
fig. 43, m), hog, leopard, deer, and seal it is uually about half an inch in breadth at.
its narrowest portion, and rather less than a quarter of an inch in thickness; while in
the giraffe. camel, and horse it increases to twice these dimensions.

Another peculiarity in the right ventricle of the mammal, to which a passing allusion
is due, appears in the form of a conical-shaped projection (Plate XIV. fig. 37, a), the
so-called infundibulum (CRUVEILHIER), or conus arteriosus (WOLFF *), sitnated at the
upper and anterior portion (p) of the yentricle. 'This projection, which communicates
above or at its 8ummit with the pulmonary artery (&), has the effect of lengthening the
right ventricle towards the base to the extent of half an inch or 80 in moderate-sized
