STRASBURGER* saw it rise 70 centims. in Wistaria. In winter, Von H6unen
observed little or no negative pressure, but, as shown by STRASBURGER, was incorrect
in supposing that air spaces never come into direct contact with the vessels.
Many of Von Houneu’s physical conclusions are, unfortunately, inaccurate, and
this vitiates his measurements of the pressure in the vessels, but the latter suffice
to show that while the pressure is never zero, it is often much less than an
atmosphere.

The Permeability of the Wood to Air.

Von Houvet greatly over-estimated the resistance to the flow of air along open
narrow tubes, which plays little or no part in the maintenance of negative tensions
in the vessels. The latter is, in fact, due solely to the relative impermeability of the
moist walls and pit-membranes of the vessels. SrRasBuURGERT confirms Von
HO6xHNeEt’s observation that a stream of air-bubbles escapes through branches of the
Maple and other trees closed at their outer cut surfaces and subjected at their inner
ends under water to a pressure 60 centims. or more of Hg less than an atmosphere.
The stream ceases when the difference of pressure is less pronounced and, according
to SrraspurGer, dry wood allows air to pass more readily than wet wood.
Lrerzmann{ as well as Wresver and Moniscu,§ state, however, that gases diffuse
more rapidly through walls saturated with water than through dry walls. The
latter statement is quite correct, for a uniform imperforate cellulose membrane is
more permeable to a gas when saturated with a liquid in which that gas is soluble
than when dry. Owing to the structure of wood, however, the reverse is the case
with this tissue. Apart from the formation of cracks, and the presence of open
