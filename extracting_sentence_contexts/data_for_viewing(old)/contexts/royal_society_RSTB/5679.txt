connection, however, it is of interest to compare this apparently normal miniature
adult with its persistent tail, with the similar type commonly occurring among those
cultures of Ascidiella and Phallusia already referred to that had been reared in hyper-
alkaline water. Therefore, in general, hyper-alkalinity preventing accumulation of
acid or carbon dioxide in the case of larvee of the Ascidiide and viviparity in the case
of larvae of the Molgulidee seem to produce the same larval modifications. In both
cases there is delayed metamorphosis resulting in tadpoles the trunk region of which
has grown in size and possesses ectodermal ampulle, and also a tendency for complete
metamorphosis of the trunk to occur without there being any absorption of the tail.

* The tendency to metamorphose before liberation from the parent has been seen in M. lanceplaini,

M. complanata, M. cooperi, M. verrucifera, and M. citrina, and in fact is not confined to species of Molgula,
but is common to most viviparous ascidians (see Part I, p. 64).
