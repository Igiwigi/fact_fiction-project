In actual practice, various sets of points P, K will appear, according to the
crystal structure of the material.

4. SPECTRUM NOTATION

An X-ray line, due to a transition between two inner shells, will be referred to in
terms of the nomenclature of these shells (e.g. the KZ, line). When the state from which
the transition takes place is a valence level, giving rise to an ‘emission band’, the
notation of X-ray shells becomes inconvenient, owing to the fact that levels denoted
by different symbols co-exist at the same energy value. Hence, we shall use the
symbol V for the valence electrons (e.g. the KV band). In cases which are not liable
to ambiguity, we shall frequently omit the symbol V altogether (e.g. ‘the K-band
of Li’).
