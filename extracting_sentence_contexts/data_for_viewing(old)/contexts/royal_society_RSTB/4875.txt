tions obtained for successive (overlapping) 8-week periods, in respect of which Hooxrr
draws the following conclusions (p. 120) :—

“ Looking first at the curve showing the connection between rain and wheat,
the most striking features are the dips about October and in winter, both very nearly
identical. As a matter of fact the winter dip is slightly greater than the other.
But no weight can be attached to so slight a difference, and we must apparently regard
a dry seed-time and a dry subsequent winter as about of equal importance. Sir
Narrer SHAw appears to have been the first to call attention to the great advantage
of a dry autumn, and my calculations fifteen years ago pointed to this period being
more important than the winter. It is not very clear from the writings of GILBERT
and Lawes how far they realised this feature of the wheat’s requirements ; it would
seem that they were aware of it, but they lay all stress upon the winter rainfall and
the washing of the nitrates out of the soil. Wheat is a deep-rooting plant, and I
believe it to be probable that, if experiments could be devised to test the point,
it would be found that the real effect of a very wet autumn is mechanical—that
it is then more the clogging of the soil that prevents the proper development of the
root system than the absence of sufficient nitrates. The effect of the loss of the
