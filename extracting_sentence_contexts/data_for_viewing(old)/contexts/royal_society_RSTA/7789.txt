as 3, and the evidence would not come from discrepancies within the range where
observations exist but from their absence where we should expect them.

In practice, if we were given the individual observations for such a series, we should
discard the normal law on account of the fact that the observations are all separated
by integral multiples of a constant. This would suggest a variation of the binomial
type. But if instead of three sources of error, each capable of giving only two values,
we had three each implying a uniform distribution of the chance of error between two
fixed limits, the observations would not reveal their discreteness in this way, and also
the difference between the true law and the normal would be less, and would take more
ul it.
