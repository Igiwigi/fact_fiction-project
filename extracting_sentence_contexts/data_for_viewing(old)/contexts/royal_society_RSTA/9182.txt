Axial Ratios of the Optical Ellipsoid.—The values of these ratios are given in the
accompanying tables for both ellipsoids. The left hand series in each case are
calculated with the 8 value for each salt taken as unity. The right hand series
exhibit the total change in the dimensions of the optical ellipsoid on passing from
one salt of the group to another, the 8 value for the initial potassium salt being
taken as unity for all four salts. The main fact that these latter ratios indicate is
the accelerating nature of the change in dimensions of the ellipsoid as the atomic
weight of the alkali metal rises. The slight set-back of the y values for the rubidium
salt is due to the effect of the diminution in double refraction, as already explained.
The dimensions of the ellipsoid of the ammonium salt are intermediate, another proof
of the true character of the isomorphism, for they lie within the values for the
extreme metallic salts of the eutropic series.

Molecular Optical Constants.—These are by far the most valuable of the optical
constants, and they are set forth in order in the three next tables.
