- Now in the paper on © Precession ” we found the initial condition, on the hypothesis
ghat K was zero. Hence the effect of solar tidal friction is to increase the angular
FSelocity of the two bodies when their relative motion is zero. Since K may be large,
I follows that the disturbance of the solution of $ 16 of © Precession” may be
nsiderable.
Z This therefore shows that it is probable that an accurate solution of our problem
Frould differ considerably from that found in © Precession,” and that the common
gular velocity of the two bodies might have been very great.
'S If KeeLeR's law holds good, then the periodic time of the moon about the earth,
Avhen their centres are 6,000 miles apart, is 2 hrs. 36 m., and when 5,000 miles apart
ED 1 hr. 57 m. ; hence when the two spheroids are just in contact, the time of
Hevolution of = moon would be between 2 hrs. and 24 hrs.
S Now it is a remarkable fact that the most rapid rate of revolution of a mass of fluid,
If the same mean density as the earth, which is consistent with an ellipsoidal form of
Equilibrium, is 2 hrs. 24 m. Is this a mere coincidence, or does it not rather point

& *It is not possible to make an adequate consideration of the suhject of this section
without a treatment of the theory of the tidal friction of a planet attended by a pair
of &atellites.

It was shown above that if the moon were to move orbitally nearly as fast as the
earth rotates, the solar tidal friction would be more important than the lunar, however
