freezing point caused by the presence of B to be less than the normal. It is not quite
certain that the experiments described in the present paper contain any examples
supporting Van’r Horr’s theory of solid solutions.

On the other hand, the fact proved experimentally by Kiser and by Le Cuarerier,
that when the solid separating is an isomorphous mixture of A and B, all the freezing
points lie on a straight line joining A to B, is probably illustrated by part of the
copper-tin curve.

When the liquid AB separates into two conjugate liquids before the formation of
solid, this process, which, since it generally occurs with falling temperature, may be
expected to be exothermic, might evolve enough heat to affect the thermometer and
give a false freezing point. The freezing point curve of a pair of conjugate liquids
in contact with each other is perfectly illustrated by our copper-lead curve.
