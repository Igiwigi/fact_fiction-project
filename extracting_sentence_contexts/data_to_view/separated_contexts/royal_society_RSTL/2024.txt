Here there is no original disease of the
vital organs. Could the sensibility be sufficiently maintained to preserve a

due frequency of respiration, and nourishment from time to time be introduced

into the stomach, life would go on as in Sleep, till the increasing affection

* Such facts are adduced in the paper last referred to as I believe will be admitted to prove that
respiration is at all times an act of volition, excited by the sensation caused by the want of fresh air

in the lungs; and the more the sensibility is impaired, the want must be allowed to become the greater,
in order to excite the effort which relieves it. . DR. PHILIP ON THE NATURE OF SLEEP.
