The Griess ‘‘droplet,”’ however, showed much less decrease than the KI “droplet”. The
apparent concentration after the spray had condensed was about four times that
determined by the KI “droplet.’” This was due to the presence of SO, which would
have affected the KI and not the Griess tests. (The fact that the spray affected the
KI more than the Griess, seemed to suggest that other oxidizing agents were
present besides NO,.)

(2) The effect of washing the gases at t.d.c. + 50° was to give the same apparent
concentration for both types of “ droplet,” so that this process removed the inhibitors.

(3) The results with cyclohexane (which appeared to be fairly free from sulphur)
showed that a certain amount of oxidizing spray was present at — 7°, and that
washing at -++ 50° merely removed NO,.

(4) From certain other experiments the use of petrol to which aldehydes had been
added appeared to contaminate the valve and delay future tests. This effect on
subsequent tests was also particularly marked when using Pratt’s benzole, and is
probably to be ascribed to the accumulation of products containing SOx, etc., which
may have been condensed in small traces in the valve. The gas samples from the expansion stroke after passage of flame do not contain
more than a small quantity (1 or 2°) of residual oxygen and therefore NO formed
in the flame, or NO, dissociated by the flame, might not have formed NO, when it
reached the reagents.
