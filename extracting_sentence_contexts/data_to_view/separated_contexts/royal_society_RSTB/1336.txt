It occurs as is well known in lesions of the cerebellum (see later). In the above cats the superior cerebellar peduncle would have been divided after its
‘decussation, and, therefore, ascending impulses from the cut surface would pass to
left hemisphere, the hemisphere the connections of which with the cord are cut
‘@f by the incision. Or the impulses might have descended from the eut surface by
fhe direct fibres on the left side, coming from the quadrigeminal region; if this
‘ere so, one would have expected to see this phenomenon in the hemisphere cats.
pulses might have passed from the left hemisphere across the corpus callosum to
e opposite hemisphere ; in favour of this might be advanced the fact that extensive
neration changes had immediately followed, especially in the first cat, in the left
misphere after the incision, and that the irritation set up by the changes might
ve been transmitted across the corpus callosum.

g Symptoms following Hemisection of the Cervical Spinal Cord.

2 The hemisection was made in the cervical region, on the right side, close under the
Si careation The symptoms were similar to those which have been described by
Fumerous observers. The paralysis on the right side was more marked and more
sistent, especially in the leg, than in cats in which the left hemisphere was
gemoved, or in which a hemisection was made in the quadrigeminal region. The
wifference between the paralysis of cortical and spastic origin has also been pointed
ut by observers.
