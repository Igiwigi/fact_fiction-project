with solid rock, snch as that composing the crust of our earth, might be taken adyan-
tage of to devise a method of determining the depth of sea below a vessel. If an
instrument could be constructed which, when snspended on board ship, would indicate
extremely slight variations in the total attraction of the earth, those indications might
be referable to the depth of sea, and a scale be obtained whose divisions would give the
depth in fathoms, or other units, without having recourse to the laborious process of
sounding by means of the sounding-line.

Terrestrial Attraction: Newrox.—Our knowledge regarding terrestrial attraction dates
from NewrzoNn, who proved that © the attraction of a spherical shell on an external
particle is the same as if the mass of the shell were collected at the centre,” and that
the earth might be considered as consisting of an aggregate of such shells. Bearing in
view, however, the fact of the earth's rotation he proved its ellipticity, and that partly
in consequence of that form, and partly on account of the centrifugal force engendered
by its rotation, the total attraction of the earth in reference to a point on its surface
must vary with latitude*. He determined the ratio of increase on the supposition that
the earth is homogeneous, and showed that it varies as the square of the sine of the
latitude. It is actually represented by the formula

g9=9'(1+:005133 sin?a),

in which 9 signifies gravitation at a place in latitude x, and g'=32-088 gravitation at
the Equator.
