Strengths. Approximately 74 per cent of respondents either agreed or strongly
agreed that automatic document clustering was a useful feature to refine search
results (‘I see that it enables you to sub-select something like ‘basic skills’ which
would be useful’). The usefulness of automatic clustering, however, was shown to
depend on: (i) a desire to browse (‘I can’t see I’d use this feature much because I
tend to come to databases with a specific task, not to browse generally’) and (ii)
a recognition of one’s interests in the topics available.

Weaknesses. Two main problematic areas were reported: accuracy anc
understandability. With respect to accuracy, evaluation participants reportec
that 51 per cent of the automatically generated clusters were useful, but 12 per
cent (standard deviation s.d. 10%) thought that they were not relevant. More o
an issue for users, however, was the fact that the automatic clustering function
was not easy to understand. Even after using it, interviewees were not able to
explain the exact function and nature of the clusters. Typical responses were ‘I’m
not sure where they come from’, ‘are they linked to the taxonomy terms?’ anc
‘another way of sorting information’.

Improvements. Suggested improvements included the provision of clear
guidance as to the differences between using clusters and taxonomy terms to refine
search results, and also the ability for users to select several topics simultaneously
to further narrow down results.
