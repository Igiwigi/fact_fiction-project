Although the more recent taxonomic system of JACKSON (1912) is available,
and in some respects preferable, it has proved more satisfactory to treat of the
morphology of the ambulacra in association with the older scheme. This is doubtless
due to the close accord between Grecory’s classification and that of Duncan (1889) ;
the latter was based mainly on ambulacral characters. The section was originally
written out on JAcKson’s system, but the result abounded in repetition and failed
to bring out the morphogenetic facts clearly. Whether this was due to defects in
the classification, or to the existence of numerous lines of parallel development, is a
matter that cannot profitably be considered here. Systematic discussion is out of
place in a paper devoted to purely morphological topics; especially since reference
to non-Holectypoid orders is merely incidental to the main purpose of the work.
