The cave is
Situated in one of the compact beds which lies between two
others of the coarser oolitic variety ; the latter vary in colour
from light yellow to blue; the compact beds are of a dark
grey passing to black, are extremely fetid, and full of corals
and spines:of the echinus cidaris. The compact portions; of
this oolite. partake of the property common to.compact lime-

ascertained: into this question (which is one of considerable
difficulty in geology) it is foreign to my present purpose to
enquire, any farther than to state that they were neither pro-
duced, enlarged, or diminished by the presence of the animals
whose bones we now find in them. The abundance of such caverns in the lime-stone of the
vicinity of Kirkdale, is evident from the fact of the engulf-
ment of several of the rivers above enumerated in the course
of their passage across it from the eastern moorlands to the
vale of Pickering; and it is important to observe, that the
elevation of the Kirkdale cave, above the bed of the Hodge
Beck, exceeding 100 feet, excludes the possibility of our
attributing the muddy sediment we shall find it to contain,
to any land flood or extraordinary rise of the waters of that
or any other now existing river. It was not till the summer of 1821, that the existence of
any animal remains, or of the cavern containing them, had
been $uspected. At this time, in continuirig the operations of
a large quarry along the brow of the slope just mentioned,
(see Plate X'VI. fig. 1.) the workmen accidentally intersected
the mouth of a long hole or cavern, closed externally with
rubbish, and overgrown with grass and bushes.
