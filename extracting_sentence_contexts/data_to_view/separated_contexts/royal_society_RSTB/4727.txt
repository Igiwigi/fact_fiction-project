We can thus
only conclude that the rete trunk is the main source of blood supply for the lower lateral
cutaneous artery, and is thus efferent from the supra-hepatic rete, and not, as supposed
by Miter, afferent to it. How far the anastomotic branch from the lateral cutaneous artery is also a tributary
of the lower lateral cutaneous artery is not clear. The angle at which it meets the
trunk of the lower lateral cutaneous artery is compatible with the flow being from this
vessel, and the same conclusion is suggested by the fact that in specimen C this
anastomosis was represented only by a branch of the lower lateral cutaneous artery, and
in specimen D was considerably narrower in its mesial parts than at either end, and
gave off from its lower half numerous small branches (fig. 10, p. 231), the inclination
of which was in many instances away from the lower lateral cutaneous artery. On the whole it seems probable that the lower lateral cutaneous artery was originally
a branch of the lateral cutaneous, which later contracted a connection with the
pericardial artery and supra-hepatic rete, and that this connection is now the chief and
in some cases the only source of its blood supply, and is in process of supplanting the
original root by which the vessel derived from the lateral cutaneous artery. After leaving the common stem, close behind the scapula, the lower lateral cutaneous
artery, now represented by two parallel vessels, runs beneath the skin obliquely
downwards and backwards towards the pelvic fins, giving off above and below a series
of superficial intermuscular branches.
