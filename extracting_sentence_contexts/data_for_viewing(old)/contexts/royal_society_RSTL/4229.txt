These analyses determine with certainty the ratio of the hydrogen to the carbon
in the ceroten, and leave no doubt as to the nature of the hydrocarbon. M. Lewy
attempted to take the density of the vapour of paraffin from bees'-wax. He found,
however, that this could not be effected, as the substance was altered, in process of
convyersion into yapour, with the formation of a small quantity of hydrocarbon gas ;
the paraffin however remaining white, and the analysis showing no variation in com-
positionÂ®. It has been also remarked by others that if bees-wax be repeatedly distilled,
the solid hydrocarbon disappears from the distillate. These observations point to the
source of the oil in the distillation of the Chinese wax, viz. the transformation of the
ceroten itself into isomeric hydrocarbons. In fact, I found, if the ceroten be distilled
and redistilled in a closed tube of the form annexed, that by effecting =
the distillation in this manner under pressure, after about two distil- 0)
lations the distillate becomes liquid and the-solid matter entirely dis-
appears. The experiment after about six distillations was put an end to by the
bursting of the heated end of the tube, when a large quantity of combustible vapour
