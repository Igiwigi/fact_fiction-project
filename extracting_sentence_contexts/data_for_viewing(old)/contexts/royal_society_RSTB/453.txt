Tndeed the variations in the size, form, and other features of these smaller branches
afford a fresh illustration of their insufficiency as foundations whereon to establish
distinct genera. Some of my sections, especially the Cabinet specimens 1918 C and
1918 D, afford clear evidence that the exterior of the cortex was more or less clothed
with multi-cellular hairs, Fig. 27 represents two of these hairs from the former of
the above sections, and fig. 26 is part of the cortex of the latter one with the hairs in
situ. Both the sections belong to the same stem as fig. 20, in which also the bases of
some of these hairs are seen at g, g. It is quite possible that this plant may prove to
be merely a more fully developed and less hirsute form of the Rachiopteris hirsuta
described in Memoir Part XV., in which case it may stand as &. hirsuta, var.
ramosa. Beyond this its real affinities are, as yet, uncertain. Many of its features
suggest a relationship with the Ferns, but since no traces of its foliage have yet been
discovered, this affinity cannot at present be determined. It is a curious fact that we

have as yet only discovered the leaves of one of the many supposed Fernstems which
I have described—and that is precisely the one (Lygynodendron Oldhamium) the
general features of which, at the first glance, were the least suggestive of any affinities
with the Filicine. Most of our recent ferns have their vascular bundles composed
of a xylem element associated with a concentric phloém, but this was certaiuly not
the case with all the Carboniferous Ferns. In the Myelopteris described in my
Memoir VII., I found vacant spaces associated with the vascular bundles ; I erroneously
confounded these spaces with the gum-canals which are so abundant in the same
