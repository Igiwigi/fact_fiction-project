The probable divergence between the formula and the observations is here about
0-97, or about 0-1 per cent. of the observed values of 8. This is well within the prob-
able error of the observations themselves. In fact the fit is so close that the divergence
cannot be shown on a diagram drawn to a scale suitable for reproduction. R 2
