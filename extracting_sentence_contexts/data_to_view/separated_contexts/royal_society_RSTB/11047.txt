In the absence of escape or avoidance, return of fear would
be followed by additional extinction and eventual fear
reduction. As return of fear alone is a transient state, encour-
agement to tolerate fear throughout exposure sessions is
particularly beneficial (see Stimulus variability and Optimizing
inhibitory regulation during exposure therapy, sections 2f(i)
and 2g). In fact, the success of an exposure treatment may be
measured most accurately by the increase in approach than
by the decrease in fear. In support, higher avoidance at pre-
treatment (and not higher fear) predicts poorer response to
exposure-based treatments [73]. It is of utmost importance to extend research on fear extinc-
tion to include avoidance behaviours.
