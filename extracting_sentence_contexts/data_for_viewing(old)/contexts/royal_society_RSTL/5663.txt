'=strength of the fin-rays, and the thickness and hardness of the fulcral scales on the
alga lobe, account for the preservation of these parts in more perfect condition than
others less qualified to resist the destructive agencies to which they have been exposed.
Recent discoveries have disclosed a chain of evidence connecting these specimens with
others, some of which were formerly assigned to the Sauroid and Cclacanthoid families.
The first link was afforded by a specimen which, in addition to the lower lobe of
the caudal fin, contained the anal fin; subsequently a specimen came to light having
the ventral fins superadded to the anal and caudal fins; and lastly, a fine example in
hard las, showing the posterior part of the cranium, both pectoral fins, both ventral fins,
the dorsal fin and the anal fin (Plate LXVII.). The snout and the tail are deficient.
The study of this specimen, and more especially of the scapulocoracoid arch and its
appendages, led to the identification of many other specimens of the anterior parts
which were not before supposed to have belonged to this genus. The facts brought to

light by these discoveries, and the more extended obseryations based thereupon, fully
corroborate the conclusion arrived at by Professor AGas81z, that this genus, although
differing generically from the Sturgeons of the present epoch, belonged, nevertheless, to
the same family. These facts I now proceed to particularize in detail, commencing
with a general description of the most perfect specimen, and proceeding step by step
through the anatomical characters displayed in the several UL OPEc ns 1 have examined,
