As the distinction of this species is almost exclusively based on
those characters it is not unlikely that what has been regarded as two species of
Ditylum are again modifications of one species. This question should, however, be
settled by someone with better taxonomic qualifications. I mention the above facts
to show that even in pure lines there exists a considerable range of variability affecting
a number of characters of systematic importance.

(a) Cell division
The cells of Ditylum grow in a longitudinal direction until they reach a certain
maximum size which is rather uniform within a culture, but which may differ markedly
from subculture to subculture (see p. 27). The division of the nucleus and protoplast
then takes place and the new valves are formed inside the parental shell before the

separation of the daughter cells (fig. 1b, d, Plate 1). After separation the new valve
lies at first well within the old girdle (fig. 1c, Plate 1) and is gradually being pushed
forward out of it (fig. 1a, Plate 1).
