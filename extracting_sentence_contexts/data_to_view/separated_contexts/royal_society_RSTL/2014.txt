So confused have been the ideas of physiologists on this part of the snbject,
that to account for the continued action of the museles of respiration and their
intimate connexion with the vital system, they have supposed a third class of
muscles partaking of the nature of both the others, those of voluntary and in-
voluntary motion, to which it has been alleged the muscles of respiration be-
long. Ifthis be the case, these muscles must change their nature every instant,
because they are the same muscles which are employed in a thousand other
acts uniyersally acknowledged to be mere acts of volition ; and, on the other
hand, when powerful causes impede the breathing, all the muscles of the trunk
are employed in this function. Besides, the facts which have been laid before
the Society prove not only that there is no such class of muscles as that here
supposed, but that the laws of excitability are the same in all muscles, the dif-
ference between the muscles of voluntary and involuntary motion depending
wholly on the nature of their functions and the circumstances in which they
are placed. The neryous influence, although equally capable of influencing
both, is supplied to them in different ways and for different purposes, the
usual functions of the muscles of yoluntary wholly, of involuntary motion
in no degree, depending on that s8ystem. The action of the muscles of respi-
ration continues during sleep, because the exhaustion of the sensitive system is
not complete, and the cause which influences this system in their excitement,
continues in our sleeping as well as waking hours; and the same is true of
all other muscles of voluntary motion, as far as the causes which induce us to
excite them are applied.
