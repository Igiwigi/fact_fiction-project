each predictor, accumulated over the 20 years of survey data spatio-temporal c-index for all species. The RMSE ranged
(1999-2019). Thus, the vulnerability indicator combines the effects from 1.3 to 5.7 (electronic supplementary material, table
from both the sensitivity of the growth rate to climate change and A.3). The spatio-temporal c-index ranged from 72% to 88%

the amount of exposure. However, it takes into account only the
isolated effect from one predictor, while there are likely inter-
actions between the impacts of different aspects of climate
change. As an overall indicator of climate change impact, that sim-
ultaneously considers all predictors as well as their interactions,
we used the full IBM to generate abundance projections under
two scenarios: the factual, observed climate scenario and a coun-

(table 2), indicating moderate to excellent model fit depend-
ing on the species. The two measures ranked models in a
different order but the model for alpine accentor scored
best in both. Separately considering the spatial and temporal
predictive accuracy (electronic supplementary material, table
A.3) showed that all models had good to excellent accuracy in

ter-factual no-climate-change scenario, which consisted of trend- the spatial predictions, as the spatial AUC ranged from 74%
corrected predictors to simulate a stationary climate. The impact to 89%, but less and more variable temporal predictive accu-
measure was then given by the ratio of projected mean adult racy, with the temporal c-index ranging from 42% to 80%
