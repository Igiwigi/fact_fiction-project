small strains such as those that are characteristic for brittle materials [43]. The grid pattern
is first either engraved [44] or transferred onto the flat specimen surface with an appropriate
technique [45]. Metrological printed grids consist of white and black contrast lines that are
superimposed on the specimen as shown in figure 1 by applying photosensitive coating of small
thickness on a polymer base with high-resolution printers (50 800 dpi) that are able to reach up to


20 lines mm". Depositing the carrier onto the sample surface is a more common technique when ls |
it comes to testing cementitious materials. This is achieved by first coating the photographic film

and sample surface with a thin layer of white epoxy glue that ensures a good image contrast. 3
After curing, the film is slowly peeled off the base. This results in black lines being transferred : o
onto the specimen surface, based on the fact that the peeling stress between the black ink and the is
glue is much higher than the stress between photographic coating and support. Indeed, the fact : Zs
that the sample surface has to be instrumented by depositing a perfect regular pattern represents : B

a drawback of this method from a practical point of view, as the gluing process is a cumbersome
task that can introduce initial imperfections to the deposited grid.

In the present case, the specimen surface is recorded during the test with an ultra-high-speed
camera. Assuming continuous light being detected by the photosensitive fill, dedicated to one
pixel on the camera chip, the intensity of digitalized light at a given position of a captured :
frame can be expressed with a periodical fringe function. Spatial phase fields can be calculated, :=
using one of the many phase detection algorithms [46]. The routine used in the present case is 3
based on the windowed discrete Fourier transform already implemented in MatlabÂ® software. :
