invariant 1 —=R=0. Hence it is evident that the same invariant relation will eXxpress
for two conics on a quadric that the pole of the plane of each with respect to the qua-
dric lies on the plane of the other; and as circles s0 related cut orthogonally, we shall
extend the term as in art. 9, and say that two conics 80 related cut orthogonally. In
fact the relation 1-R=0 may be called (see art. 9) the harmonic invariant of the qua-
Arics or conics whose equations are connected by it.
67. It is evident from the last article that, being given four plane conics on a quadric,
the condition that the four conics should be tangential to a fifth is the determinant
0, (12), (13), (14),
(12), 0, (23), (24),
(13), (23), 0 , (39,
(14), (24), (39), 0,
and in fact Dr. Sa1Mox's direct proof of this theorem in case of conics on a plane will
apply verbatim to the more general case here considered (sce SALMON'S * Conics,” 5th
edition, page 366).
Cor. From the equation (71) we can find, as Dr. SALMoN has done for conies on a plane,

the equations of the pairs of conics which touch three conics on a quadric; the equa-
tion is

=0;- 9/4 41  He

M 23S—L)+4/ BY(S=N)+V/(12)(&=N)=0; . . . . (79)
or this equation may be inferred also from art. 59.
