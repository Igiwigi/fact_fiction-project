Wavel, although significant in terms of wave height (total of 19m) mostly hit the base of the
La Jument lighthouse. Its crest is likely to have reached only the upper level of the reinforced
concrete ring with limited effect on the structural response of the tower. Testimonies from archives [55] also support this fact. In a letter from 1930, following severe
storms, engineer Quemeneur stated (translated from French):

â€œ... Dangerous oscillations for the optics take place only by severe storms from WNW to
South, in two different ways: 1) WNW to SSW: oscillations with very rough sea and when
waves pass minimum 3 to 4m higher than the top of the base platform.
