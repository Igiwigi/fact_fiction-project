materially our knowledge as to general mechanics of the vegetable cell.

Although I am aware of the danger of rushing to conelusions, I cannot but remark
that when these results—which were foreshadowed by Sacns and Haxsreln when
they discovered the perforation of the sieve-plate—are taken in connexion with those
of Rus80w, it appears extremely probable that nob only in the parenchymatous cells
of pulyini, in phloem parenchyma, in endosperm cells, and in the prosenchymatous
bast-fibres, is continuity established from cell to cell, bub that the phenomena is of
much wider, if not of universal occurrence.

Finally, I have to acknowledge the many kindnesses I haye received during this
investigation. Of Professor Sacns' kindness to me it is impossible for me to speak
sufficiently highly. The mere fact that it was ab his suggestion that this work was
undertaken will «how how much I owe him. To my friend and former teacher,
Dr. S. H. Vixzs, I am indebted for much valuable advice, Especially must I also
express my most sincere gratitude to my friend, Dr. D. H. Scorr, not only for his
valuable eriticisms and suggestions, but for the many assistances that he has given
me in every possible way during the whole of this difficult work.
