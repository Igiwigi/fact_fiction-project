However, in both plant
and animal communities, species richness can mediate the likelihood of directional invasion resulting from invader impacts on abiotic
conditions (such as plant-soil feedbacks) [62]. For example in a sessile epibenthic fouling community, space availability and species

drift and genetic change, may maintain mixed-species communities well-within the bounds of community phase space [61,64]. Sig-

In some cases, novel interactions contribute to net positive outcomes for biodiversity and ecosystems [14,67,68].
