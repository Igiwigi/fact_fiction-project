‘ratings toxic’.

The figure of the audience is foremost in the media decision-maker’s mind at every
step, including ideas development, pitching, commissioning, production (including editing in
response to feedback, for example, from channel and co-producer executives), and assessment
of reception. But what this concern for audience response means in practice varies widely. Even

slot to satisfy a discrete set of tastes and expectations about challenging factual content for an
audience of 100000. These often fine-grained distinctions between channels, and between slots
on channels, have been complicated but not much eroded by the emergence of new ways of
watching TV presented by set-top boxes and video on demand services on a wide range of devices

The next section reviews a body of examples of programming spread across 50 years.
It explores how population and end-of-process concerns with pollution became dominant
storylines rather than per capita consumption of materials; how reduced consumption themes


have on occasion won airtime, but primarily by being framed as exotic and alternative. The
section goes on to consider how more recently there have been successful programmes (in
