I mixed a few grains
of potassium with red oxide of mercury, and ignited the mix-
ture in contact with boracic acid, but no elastic product, except

mercury, was eyolved. I made some potash- by the combustion of potassium in

a glass tube, and ignition of the peroxide, I added to it dry
boracic acid, and heated the mixture to redness. Sub-borate
of potash was formed, and there was not the slightest indica-
tions of the presence of moisture.*

It is evident from this chain of facts, that common potash

#® These processes must not however be considered as shewing that boracic acid
that has been heated to whiteness is entirely free from water; they merely prove that
Such an acid gives off no water by combination with pure potash at a red beat. 1
haye found that boracic acid in perfect fusion, and that has been long exposed to the
blast of a forge, and that has long ceased to effervesce, gives globules of hydrogene ;
when dry iron filings are made to act upon it. T added to 54 grains of boracic acid in
complete fusion, in a crucible of platina, 75 grains of flint glass that had been pre-
viously heated to whiteness, and immediately reduced into powder in a hot iron mor-
tar; by raising the heat so as to produce combination, a copious efferyescence was
produced ; and after intense ignition for half an hour, the mixture was found to have
lost three grains and a quarter,

The combinations of boracic acid with. potash and soda, that have been heated to
redness, I find lose weight when their temperature is raised to a much higher
degree. Thus, in an experiment made in the laboratory of my friend Joun Geonce
