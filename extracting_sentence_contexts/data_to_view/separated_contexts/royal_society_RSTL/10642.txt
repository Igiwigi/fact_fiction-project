The comparative difficulty of magnetising a short rod is shown by fig. 3 in a way
which requires no comment. If we were to infer values of py and « from the tesb of
the 50 diameters rod, neglecting the fact that the magnetising force due to the
solenoid is not the whole of H, we should find for the maximum of p 656, and for that
of « 52; and these coefficients are much more nearly uniform for various values of the
magnetising force than when we determine them in a legitimate manner by observ-
ing the magnetisation of very long rods or of rings. $17. From this and other experiments, I concluded that even when dealing with
the softest iron, we may take a rod whose length is not less than 300 diameters 45
giving results scarcely different from those given by a ring or a longer rod, and in gubse-
quent experiments rods were almost exclusively used whose length was from 300 to 400
