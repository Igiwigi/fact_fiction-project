I might, perhaps, also
mention changes of the wind, and snow storms, as being sometimes attended
with fluctuations in the intensity of the needles. If the times of their vibration
at different periods are compared, differences in their relative intensity will be
noticed ; that of No. 2. having on the average been diminishing, during the last
three months nearly, in a more rapid ratio than No. 1. This must, I think, be
considered an interesting fact, if confirmed by future observations. It does

* If the rivets which attach the magnetic bar to the support are placed at a proper distance from
the acting pole, the equipoise of the two extremities will not be affected by the contraction or expan-
sion of the bar.

+ The neutralization of the pole would haye been more fully effected had a smaller proportion of it
extended beyond the centre of suspension ; 14 to 14 an inch would probably haye been sufficient. OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM. 201

not seem easy to account for the discrepancies which not unfrequently oc-
eurred in the indications afforded by the two needles at the same time, and I
hesitate. to adopt any distinct conclusions from this circumstance without
further experiments, which I intend to make with horizontal needles on the
same principle.
