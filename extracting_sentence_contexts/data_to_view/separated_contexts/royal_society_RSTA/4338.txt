During the next three
decades, a small but growing number of broadcast television companies continued to provide
general entertainment as well as specific genres such as news, and with the arrival of satellite
broadcasting to UK audiences in 1990 a much wider choice of broadcast content became available. However, while this brought about a certain amount of diversity, and a degree of choice
by the consumer selecting channels as desired, the choice was mainly between pre-scheduled
programme channels alongside content that had been purchased or recorded from channels for
viewing at a later time. From a userâ€™s point of view coming from two, three or four channel
choices, this seemed to be a step change in viewing experience despite the fact it was just more
of the same scheduled approach to channelled content. The user expectations were based on the
limitation of the previous decades and so that underpinned the improved experience. Between the 1960s and 1990s, there is another key area of influence to the way media were
consumed that expanded rapidly in this period.
