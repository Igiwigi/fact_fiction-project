Figure 4. Time variation in reproduction number. (a) The inferred value of the reproduction number R; as a function of time
(solid red line gives posterior mean and dashed lines indicate the 95% credible interval). This is proportional to the overall
effective contact rate (see equation (2.3)). (b) The effective reproduction number Re (which accounts for the fact that a fraction
of the population is not susceptible). Above/below the horizontal black line shows where COVID-19 is increasing/decreasing. The
vertical blue lines denote important milestones during the epidemic [31]. Arrows showing changes in the dominant COVID-19
variant are estimated from COG UK [32] (see electronic supplementary material, appendix 0) and for vaccination come from CIS
[33] (these indicate the time period in which between 5% and 95% of individuals are vaccinated with the first dose for selected
age groups). (Online version in colour.)

models that can be simulated using a t-leaping algorithm. While this represents a very broad
class of processes, including many epidemiological models of disease transmission, it should be
noted that ABC-MBP can in principle be applied to a wider range of stochastic models and is
not limited to exponential waiting times [30]. However, application of ABC-MBP methodology
to such processes including appropriately formulated agent-based models [39,40] has yet to be
assessed and will likely hit computational limits as model and data complexity are increased.
