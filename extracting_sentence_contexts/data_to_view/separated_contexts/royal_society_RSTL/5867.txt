It is evidently a part of the latter ; and yet
in the most transparent specimen (Nerine beat, mihi) it is utterly impossible to define
how the germ-products escape from the tube (@ b) into the mass (cce). But the author
is most anxious to draw especial attention to the fact of the presence of this ovarian or
sperm-mass (according to the sex) in constant and visible association with the ciliated
looped tube. It serves to reflect light upon the as8ociation of the same parts in speci-
mens in which, the demonstration is necessarily obscure. Tt, illustrates the principle
contended for in this paper, that the * segmental organ ‚Äù is the true and real source of
the generative products ; in other words, that the latter are THE organs of reproduction ;
the masses appended to the latter, hitherto mistaken by DE QUATREFAGES for ovaria and
testes, themselves being only the utricular or spermatic receptacles of their products.
