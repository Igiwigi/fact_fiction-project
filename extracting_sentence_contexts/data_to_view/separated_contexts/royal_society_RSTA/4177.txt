In particular, given the model of wer(t, Hz, é(t)), we can
compute the time-varying parametric (linear) autospectrum [68,69] as follows:

Of, 1) = oR, HA (-f, 1), (2.6)

where Hj, represents the Fourier transform of the y; terms. By integrating equation (2.6) in each
frequency band, we compute the indices within the low frequency (LF = 0.04-0.15 Hz) and high
frequency (HF = 0.14-0.45 Hz) ranges, along with their ratio (LF/HF).

(d) Maximal information coefficient

In order to quantify the coupling between two variables, we calculated the MIC [66]. This index,
in fact, is able to quantify linear and nonlinear couplings occurring between two variables over
time, x and y [66]. MIC relies on the fact that, if two variables are somehow coupled, then a grid
can be drawn on the scatterplot of the two variables. Formally, let Gxxy indicate all the possible partitions with x rows and y columns of the
scatterplot for the ordered pairs of two vectors, and I, the mutual information for one specific
partition with x x y grids that are applied to the ordered samples of the two vectors.
