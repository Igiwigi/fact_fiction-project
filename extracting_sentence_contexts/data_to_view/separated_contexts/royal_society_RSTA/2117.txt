Discussion

In the above, we started from the simple, but fundamental, condition that a system must remain
separable from its environment for an appreciable length of time [31]. On unpacking this notion—
using concepts from information geometry and thermodynamics—we found that the states
internal to a Markov blanket look as if they perform variational Bayesian inference, optimizing
posterior beliefs about the external world. In fact, both active and internal states (on average)
minimize an upper bound on surprise. This means that Markov-blanketed systems make their
world less surprising in two ways. They change their beliefs to make them more consistent with
sensory data and change their sensory data to make them more consistent with their beliefs.
