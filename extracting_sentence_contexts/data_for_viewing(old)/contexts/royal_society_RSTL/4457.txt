Animals are performed under the same essential conditions as those of Plants, and
since the acts of formation, secretion, &c. are effected by the very same agency in
animals as in plants, —namely, by cell-growth,—there is no valid reason for regard-
ing them as dependent upon nervous agency; although it must be freely admitted
that they are greatly affected by that agency, being not merely accelerated and re-
tarded through its influence, but also altered in kind, The view here advocated will,
it is believed, afford a definite scientific expression for all the phenomena which bear
upon this question. For, just as electricity developed by chemical change may ope-
rate (by its correlation with chemical affinity) in producing other chemical changes

* 'There can be little doubt that such is the function of the cells of the retina, which are shown, by the
history of the development of the eye, actually to originate in the optic ganglion. The same appears to be the
fact in regard to the cells in relation with the peripheric expansion of the auditory nerve, which originate in the
auditory ganglion, (See Mr. H. Gray's paper © On the Development of the Retina and Optic Nerve, and of
the Membranous Labyrinth and Auditory Nerve,” at p. 189 of the present volume of the Philosophical Trans-
actions,) And it seems probable from the researches of K6L11ktr (Annales des Sciences Naturelles, Ser. III,
Zool. tom. vi. p. 102), that the plexuses which appear to consritute the ultimate distribution of the sensory
nerves in the skin, are really composed of nerye-cells, which have sent out yery slender prolongations to inoscu-
late with each other.

the process of cell-formation in other parts, and thus influence all the vital manifesta-
