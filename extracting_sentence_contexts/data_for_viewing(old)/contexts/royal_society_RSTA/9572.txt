given in the fifth column. After the test had been carried out the temperature coefficient was determined
for each wire by coiling it loosely in the grooves of a double screw thread cut in an ebonite cylinder.
Potential terminals were fused to the wire at a measured distance apart and these were with the current
terminals brought out to the bridge connections by means of fine copper leads from the glass test-tube in
which the ebonite cylinder was inserted. The resistance between potential terminals was compared with
that of a manganin standard at the ice and steam points. In this way both the resistance per unit
length 7) and the temperature coefficient « were determined. It will be noticed that in the case of the
large wires the prolonged annealing is more effective in diminishing the resistance than the reduction of

”

diameter by “evaporation” in increasing it, while the contrary may be noticed in the finer wires. Wires
No. 1 to No. 7 show a marked diminution in the temperature coefficient with diameter, a fact well worth
a special investigation. Wires No. 8 to No. 10 were probably drawn from a specimen of impure platinum.

As described in Section 10, the diameters of the wires were measured directly by means of a micro-
seope.(*) It was found that the diameters of various portions of each wire varied about 1 per cent.
The mean diameter was found from ten to fifteen observations. A typical set of readings for the finest

wire (1 mil) is given below.
