into two beds, a phenomenon more carefully considered in describing the next section.
(5) The borings at Wisbech indicate that the original land surface is now at a great
depth, coming on between —32 ft. and —56 ft. O.D. The profile is composed almost
exclusively of silts, no doubt because the sites all lie within the old estuary of the Ouse.
At levels between O.D. and 4 ft. O.D., there occur thin, discontinuous seams of peat
and peaty mud which may represent the upper peat of Guyhirne now reduced to an
infilling of small channels.

The last longitudinal section to be considered is the most northern of all (fig. 27).
Commencing on the landward side in the district lying to the north of the Whittlesey
and Eastrea islands, it may be regarded as proving the deposits of a topographically
distinct drainage area, the outfall of which, in pre-drainage times, was not by way of the
Old Nene system to March and Upwell. Little in fact is yet known concerning the
ancient waterways of this part of the fens, except that both the present course of the
River Nene, which enters the Fenland at Peterborough, and Moreton’s Leam, are
artificial cuts. It is the opinion of Major Gordon Fowler that the meandering Cat-
water, which passes northward to St Vincent’s Cross, at one time formed part of the
natural course of the River Nene. The conclusion would appear valid that the area
now being examined was open to flooding by water from the Nene system, from which
water the Woodwalton district was previously shown to have been isolated in pre-
drainage times.

At Dog-in-a-Doublet sluice the base of the upper peat is at —2 ft. O.D. The peat is
also excellently preserved, being up to 6 ft. thick, though this may be due to preserva-
tion beneath clays of the made bank of the River Nene, since the adjacent fields show
