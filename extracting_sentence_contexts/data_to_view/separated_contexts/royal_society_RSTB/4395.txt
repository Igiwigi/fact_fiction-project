diameter) was filled with vaseline and the thread moved in the vaseline. The vaseline
had the effect of reducing the irreversible rise of temperature following the reversible
fall of temperature caused by unloading the muscle. This fact is of interest in
confirming the theory as given here, and will be discussed below. (3) Discussion or THERMAL EXPERIMENTS. Since the phenomena described are susceptible to some degree of an exact treat-
ment by the methods of thermodynamics, it may be well to put on record here a
deduction of the equations for a finite extension of an elastic string.
