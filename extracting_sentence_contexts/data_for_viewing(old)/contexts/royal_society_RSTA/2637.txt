fraction between intrusion is 0.49 and the melt bodies are coalescing into one large magma
chamber. Interestingly, this happens 34 kyr after the intrusion has ceased growing.

4. Discussion

The preliminary simulations presented here confirm that our conceptual model of the coalescence
between magmatic bodies is plausible. A brief exploration of the physically realistic parameter
space suggests that extensive low melt-fraction mush systems can develop over the time scales
typical for magma injection, but coalescences of melt-rich lenses is rare if due only to conductive
heating and partial melting. An interesting result is that, due to slow heat diffusion, coalescence
may happen after the main intrusive episodes, so that major caldera eruptions do not necessary
coincide in time with the main intrusive activity. The calculations are limited by the fact that they
were two dimensional and did not involve any mechanical processes; no convective processes or
fluid migration was considered and we tested only for one type of rock composition and melting
behaviour. Nevertheless, our calculations suggest these models have the potential to explain
many of the observed features of large magma reservoirs and deserve further exploration.

Within this framework, mushes coalesce and magma chambers converge, when the country
rock between intrusions partially melts. The ability of rocks to melt strongly depends on their
composition and HzO content. In the cases presented here, compositions are dacitic and melt
appears at 670Â°C. Moreover, the melting behaviour of injected magma and country rock is similar.
In nature, if the country rocks is dehydrated and refractory, mush coalescence would not happen.
By contrast, coalescence would be favoured if a hot mafic magma is injected in a wet fertile
country rock [97].
