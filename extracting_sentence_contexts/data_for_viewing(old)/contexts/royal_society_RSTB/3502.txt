Passing the tentacle space ¢;, we come to the jaw with
a, well seen lying upon it, and separated from it by a
suture both in this oral angle and the next one, reached
after passing round the jaw. To trace the sections of
this model further would involve too much repetition,
and would only afford confirmatory evidence.

The second model is composed of 37 sections parallel
to the surface of the dise passing through one of the
oral angles (figs. 1 and 2, Plate 10). The angle of the
mouth represented in this model measures 90°, and has
been forced wider open than it would be in its natural
position of rest. Owing to this fact, ad; is more

during life. The perfect regularity of the adambulacral series when there is no
