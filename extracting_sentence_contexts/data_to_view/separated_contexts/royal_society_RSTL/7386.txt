On treating the Bombay observations in the same manner, a fair general coincidence
with the calculated diurnal tides was found to exist ; but it was further found, on com-
paring together the Kurrachee and Bombay curves of actual diurnal tide (thus for the
first time recorded for the same period), that the times were nearly identical at the two
ports, and the range at Bombay about one-tenth greater than that at Kurrachee. The tables for the four months over which the Bombay observations extend were
recalculated with the diurnal tides which had been calculated for Kurrachee (but made
forty minutes earlier, and increased in range by one-tenth), and the result was quite as
good as that shown by the original tables. This fact would seem to point to the possi-
bility that the diurnal tide is a vertical undulation, acting simultaneously, or nearly 80,
over a large area. MR. WILLIAM PARKES ON THE TIDES OF BOMBAY AND KURRACHEE. 695
