In uniaxal crystals, the three axes A, B, C must be such that two
of them are equal and of the same name; while the third, corresponding with
the apparent axis, may be of the same or of a different name. In biaxal
crystals, the three axes A, B, C are unequal, and in erystals with no double
refraction the axes are equal and destroy each other*. This approximation of these two classes of facts is too remarkable to be ac-
cidental, and would go far to establish their dependence, even if it were not
indicated by other arguments which I shall proceed to illustrate. Among those crystals which have the obtuse rhomboid for their primitive
form, there are many with one axis of negative double refraction, and only one
or two with one axis of positive double refraction. In the former, the nega-
tive doubly refracting structure will be produced round the axis of the rhom-
bohedron by the compression arising from attractions in the direction of two
equal rectangular axes A, B, which will dilate the molecules in the direction
of the third axis C, and make it a negative axis of double refraction, equal in
intensity to either of the other two.
