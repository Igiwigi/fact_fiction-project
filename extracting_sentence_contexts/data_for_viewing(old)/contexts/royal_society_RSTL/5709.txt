Secondly, when R=0, the two quadrics have in this case a common root, which is
given by any of the equations,
a: 209:4*=0,B7 2B 0:8
=0,R :0;R :0,R
=be'—Ve:oa—0Va:a'—d.
The last set of values express that the Jacobian is a perfect square, and that the two
roots are each equal to the common root of the two quadrics.
The preceding values of the ratios a*: 2ay : 7 are consistent with each other in virtue
of the assumed relation R=0, hence in general the functions
49,R.9,R—(9,R)*, d,R.d,R—d,R.d,R, &c.
all of them contain the Resultant R as a factor.
It is easy to ee that the Jacobian is harmonically related to each of the quadrics; in
fact we have identically
a(bod—Vc)+b(ca'—Va)+e(ab'—db)=0,
d(b&—Ve)+V(ca—C'a)+(ab—0b)=0,

which contain the theorem in question.
