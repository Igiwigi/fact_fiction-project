C,/C, = T=1+ 3/2 (1 aE B,. p,/P),

and since, for a single gas,

1+ B= 2/{3(yâ€” 1)},

the above reduces to
PAT =1)= 30) (i= 1) 2 se. 2 ae

This equation is equivalent to
P(1 + 8) = Xp, (1 + Bi),

and merely expresses the fact that the total increment of energy per degree rise of
temperature is equal to the sum of the increments for each of the components.

Analyses of the marsh gas and ethane used showed that there was always a little
air present. The correction for this, calculated from (3) was only one or two parts
in a thousand, which is within the errors of observation, so that for the other gases,
where nothing was known as to the nature or amount of the possible impurities, no
appreciable error is likely to have resulted from omitting it.

A point requiring some consideration was the question at what temperature the
