In all cases, a linear curve fit was used
in all cases to expand the virtual fields and the second-order polynomial was used to obtain the
acceleration fields. These results demonstrate that temporal resolution higher than 100kfps provides a more
reliable identification of material stiffness. This is due to the fact that the higher the acquisition
speed, the more useful frames are obtained from the simulated sequence that can be exploited
for reconstruction of the acceleration field (size of the temporal window) which finally results
in a better temporal discretization of the reconstructed stress response (figure 7c). Nevertheless,
in the case of a spalling test, the highest frame rate cannot be considered as the best solution
owing to the limitation of the number of images obtained during one shot with an ultra-high-
speed camera (180 images with a Kirana model and 128 with an HPV-X2). Thus, this would
drastically decrease the measurement time and make it impossible to have images for both the
compression and tension phases of the test.
