that the solubility of tin in the « body decreases still further as the temperature falls,
but this decrease is certainly slight—its possible existence, however, makes it difficult
to give any estimate of the solubility of tin in the @ body at its transition temperature.
On heating, the reverse change (from « to B) only takes place gradually, a fact which
is partly accounted for by the slowness with which the 8 body takes up its full amount
of tin. When the concentration of tin in the 8 body is lower than 16 per cent., the
transformation on cooling is retarded until a lower temperature is reached; at the
same time the intensity of the reaction falls off until, with a tin content less than
8 per cent., the 8 form appears to remain stable down to the temperature of liquid
air. The fact that the intensity of the reaction falls off so markedly as the concen-

tration of tin falls below 16 per cent. suggests that the actual separation of the tin

S
itself is to some extent the source of the heat evolved, but it is not at present possible
to discriminate between the various possible sources of heat in a complex reaction.
The fact, however, that both the temperature and intensity of a change of this kind
varies with the concentration of the dissolved element finds it analogue in the higher
arrest-points of low-carbon steel.

A point of some difficulty yet remains to be dealt with. The data of the cooling-
curves show that this heat-evolution diminishes to zero at or near the concentration
