Colour range [â€”0.01, 0.11]. BlockOperator and BlockDataContainer of CIL:

Set up Tikhonov regularization for CGLS using BlockOperator and BlockDataContainer

alpha = 1.0

D = IdentityOperator (ig)

Atilde = BlockOperator(A, alpha*D)
z = D.range.allocate (0.0)

btilde = BlockDataContainer(b, z)

If instead, we want the discrete gradient as D we simply replace the second line by:

Set up GradientOperator for use in regularization

GradientOperator (ig)

GradientOperator automatically works out from the ImageGeometry ig which dimensions
are available and sets up finite differencing in all dimensions. If two or more dimensions are
present, D will in fact be a BlockOperator with a finite-differencing block for each dimension. CIL supports nesting of a BlockOperator inside another, so that Tikhonov regularization with
a Gradient operator can be conveniently expressed. In figure 5a,b Tikhonov regularization with the GradientOperator is demonstrated on
the steel-wire sample.
