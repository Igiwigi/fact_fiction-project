Some notes are added on the Middle Ordovician echinoid Myriastiches and the
Silurian genera Palaeodiscus and Echinocystis. A short note upon one of the Ordovician genera, Aulechinus, was communicated
by Spencer to the Annals and Magazine of Natural History, immediately after the death
of Dr Bather. It contained facts which had been agreed upon by Dr Bather and
Spencer, whilst working together. Dr Mortensen was anxious to include some
account of the material in his new monograph, and the note was published to help
him. At that time only fragments of the forms were known.
