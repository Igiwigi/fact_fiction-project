beginning of M. BznTzaxy's Memoir mentioned above ; I do not know the fact from any other source. DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF DYNAMICS, ETC. 105

and E(y,dr,)=dX (by (5.)),

we have E\(z;dy,) =d(â€”X+E((a;3;)),

an equation which must become identical when z,, z,, &c. on each side are expressed
in terms of y,, ys, &c. But the right side being then a complete differential of a

function of y,, 44, &c., the left side must be 80 also; hence the conditions Fa =Z musf

subsist.
