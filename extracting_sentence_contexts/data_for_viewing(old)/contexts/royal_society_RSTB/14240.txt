individual members. However, we cannot make any inferences
on whether the AAs and FAs measured were de novo syn-
thesized by plant or bacteria, and thereby not infer causative
direction between the observed links. It is though likely that
microbes, including yeasts, additionally or even primarily
shape the nutritional profiles, with their additive and depleting
interactions resulting in particular FA/AA profiles.

The complex interactions between pollen chemistry, pollen
bacterial communities and bee bacterial communities may,
among other reasons, explain why bee larvae of both specialist
and generalist bees often fail to develop on unsuitable pollen
diets [31,125-127]. In fact, pollen-borne microbes were found
to support the development of the solitary bee O. ribifloris
[31,37,128]. Changes in communities of flowering plants as a
consequence of anthropogenic activities may thus also affect
the communities and availability of microbes potentially
important for bees. This highlights the importance to further
investigate the complex interaction framework between
changes in floral communities, floral chemistry, floral and
bee microbiota and associated functional properties, which
ultimately affects bee health.
