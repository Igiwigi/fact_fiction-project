radiation in the green, and the result of the new measurement, have already been
stated in a preliminary note communicated to the Society.* The main point of this
communication was that two of the chief coronal lines, one in the blue about d 4231,
and the other in the green, had been supposed coincident with two bright chromo-
spheric lines which my investigations had shown to correspond to enhanced lines of
iron, The absence of other prominent enhanced iron lines from the corona spectrum,
and the improbability of there being a sufficiently high temperature in the corona to
produce enhanced lines, suggested a more complete investigation of the supposed
coincidences of the coronal and chromospheric lines. The non-coincidence of the
coronal line 4231 with the chromospheric line 4233 which was indicated by the
measurement of the photographs of 1893+ was fully confirmed, and it was also found
that the green line was by no means coincident with the chromospheric line 1474 K.
Its wave-length was, in fact, estimated as 5303°7, or about 13 tenth-metres more
refrangible than 1474 K (531679). This result has since been confirmed by
CAMPBELL} and EVERSHED.§

The Coronal Radiations.

In another preliminary communication to the Royal Society,|| I gave the results of
a more general investigation of the coronal spectrum. The main points may be briefly
summarised as follows :—
