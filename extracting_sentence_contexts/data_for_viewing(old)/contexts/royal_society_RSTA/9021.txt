later. Fig. 6 is a drawing of the ring halo due to emanation to a scale of
800 diameters.

As already referred to, there is interesting evidence as to the origin of these
haloes. They are—almost without exception—found located on cracks or veins in
the mica. I have in another place* referred to the conduits in this mica. These
conduits undoubtedly contained radioactive materials. They are bordered by
radioactive staining in a manner resembling the artificial halo of Ruraerrorn,
which also is an emanation halo, The border may be very faint or very dark. Its
radial extension is in general very much the same as that of the first ring of the
uranium halo, And in many cases we can quite easily detect that the border is
due to a succession of minute haloes whose centres are set close together along
the conduit. The border in these cases consists, in fact, of a number of overlapping
circles or rings, having approximately the radius of the first ring.

But every here and there one of the larger rings—the originating ring of the
emanation halo—is found among the others. Examination shows in such cases a
nucleus extending into the conduit, consisting of a refracting particle. Some of
these emanation rings may be attended with the ring of RaC and other features of
the more advanced halo, Again, the emanation halo may occur upon a fine,
hair-like crack in the mica, and otherwise unattended. Or we may find them
ranged in a linear sequence, with the originating conduit barely detectable.

Nor is this the only evidence for the movement of radioactive materials in this
mica. It is common to observe near the margin of a flake of the mineral, darkened
