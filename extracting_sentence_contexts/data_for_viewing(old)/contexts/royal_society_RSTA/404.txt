telescope scales, in the most optimistic cost models, as D to the 1.2 power, with some models
indicating an exponent of 2 [107]. Therefore, an increase in telescope diameter of a factor of 2
means a cost increase of a factor of 2 to 4, while doubling the SNR has a small to negligible impact
on the science.

To be transformational, we should aim at an improvement of at least a factor of 10 in the SNR,
and this would require the idea of an agile, highly stable platform to be abandoned in favour of a
large, deployable structure, as monolithic space telescopes are limited by fairing size to about 4m
diameter. The said structure might represent an encumbrance when trying to reach the pointing
stability required by transit observations and certainly might limit the ability to move and repoint
agilely from one target to another in the sky. Note that a factor of 10 in SNR might not be sufficient
in any case to observe the atmospheres of Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars. For those
targets, in fact, transits are expected to occur once per year, and 5-6 transits (assuming a mission
lifetime of approx. 5 years) will not be enough to collect the required photons.

Direct imaging from space is the expected next step to be taken in space after transit. Space
telescopes with various types of coronagraphs are being studied in the USA, Europe and Japan
[108-114]. A mission for direct imaging would be technically more challenging than a transit
one and certainly more expensiveâ€”the telescope cannot be a light bucket, to start with. The said
mission, though, would open up the spectroscopic exploration of planets at larger separation from
the stars, a domain that is impracticable with transits.


In the past two decades, the field of exoplanets has spoiled us in terms of creativity and
transformational ideas, so perhaps we should not be too surprised if a new technology or a new
