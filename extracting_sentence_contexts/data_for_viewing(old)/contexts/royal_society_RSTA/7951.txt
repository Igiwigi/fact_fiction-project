In all 41 materials have been tested, of which six are non-ferrous. Three of these
materials, Nos. 3671, 1414A, and 1424B, have each been tested in two different physical
conditions produced by varying the heat treatment.

In selecting the materials to be tested it was considered desirable to include those
for which the properties at liquid air temperature had previously been ascertained
HApFIELD (loc. cit.).

Tn all some 31 of these materials were included, making the selection as representative
as possible, but with a preference for those which had retained some ductility in liquid
air, specially the alloys containing nickel. These particular materials can be clearly
identified in Tables I to V, from the fact that the results previously obtained in liquid
air are shown for them.

The 10 remaining materials, of which four are non-ferrous, were selected from among
the special alloys which have subsequently come into prominence. They will be
described individually later in discussing the results obtained from them.

Heat Treatment.—The heat treatment applied in general to the ferrous specimens
in the previous research was a double one, namely, a cooling in air from 1,102° @.
following by a reheating to 777° and cooling slowly in the furnace. From the improved
metallurgical knowledge obtained in the past 25 years it is now known that with forged
or rolled specimens such as these a simple treatment consisting of slowly cooling from
800° is equally effective. This treatment was therefore adopted for those materials
