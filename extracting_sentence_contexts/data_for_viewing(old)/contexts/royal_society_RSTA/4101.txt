temperature and in excess water, the Hii phase [47,48].

Epikuron 200 (Cargill) has been very much studied in literature. It contains about 98% PC,
making it easy to control because of its purity. However, the drawback of this ingredient is

associated with its high price, and the fact that it is not food grade. Food grade lecithin emulsifiers :B
contain a mixture of PC and PE as well as other minor components such as phosphatidylserine a
(PS), diglycerides, MG and glycolipids and may contain high amount of triglycerides. To the best on
of our knowledge, a detailed understanding of their phase behaviour is missing and in particular

the precise influence of addition of PE to PC in excess of water and in the presence of oil. As
mentioned before, DOPE forms hexagonal phase and therefore has very different behaviour than

PC, which forms lamellar liquid crystalline phase at room temperature.

(ii) PL-oil phase behaviour

The phase behaviour of PL-oil-water differs strongly from the one of MG-oil-water because it
