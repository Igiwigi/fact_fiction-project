perfectly conducting strip of finite width has not yet proved tractable to the present
technique. Again, the assumption that the earth’s surface is flat cannot be waived.

Turning from the question as to when a formal solution is possible, we now consider
the method used for its reduction to an expression capable of yielding numerical results.
Basically, the procedure is to remove certain factors from the integrand of a double integral
at the ‘predominant’ values of the two variables of integration; exactly which factors are
involved depends on the particular @ and @,, but part of the integrand has always to be
treated in this way before any progress can be made. The extent of the error thus introduced
cannot be stated with precision, but it seems that the validity of the method depends on kr
and kr, being ‘large’ in the sort of way that is common in the calculation of radiation fields ;
this despite the fact that the resulting approximation to the solution is finite and continuous
at = 0 and 7, = 0 (R+0), not having the infinity which usually indicates the failure of an
asymptotic expression.* It may be remarked that the restriction is likely to be most stringent
with regard to the phase, and this is especially unfortunate ifit is true that coastal refraction
phenomena are largely determined within a wave-length of the coastline.

The direct scope of the solution is limited by the difficulties of computation. It would, of
course, be out of the question to tabulate G(a, 6) over the required complex range of a and b.
There are, however, a number of results connecting G(a,b) with the Fresnel integral
(Clemmow & Senior 1953), and the prime need for facilitating the calculations is really
a tabulation of this latter function, which would in any case be valuable in other problems.
As a contribution to this end Clemmow & Munford (1952) have computed a four-figure
table of F[./(47) a], 0<|a@| <0-8, 0<arga<45’, at intervals suitable for linear interpolation
