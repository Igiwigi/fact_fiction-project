Since Fo has logarithmic singularities, F} cannot have
singularities of higher order, while logarithmic singularities in F; are disallowed by requiring
the vorticity to be entirely at O(1). Hence, as an analytic function bounded at infinity with no
singularities, F; is a constant that can be taken to be 0 without loss of generality. This means that
the Rayleigh-Jansen expansion does not in fact have a term at O(M? log M). The term entering
the matching from (2.8) must therefore come from taking the O(M? log M) time dependence into
account appropriately, as is done in (3.6) below. Using $0 = (Fo + Fo)/2, (3.2) becomes

where c.c. stands for complex conjugate and we have defined a function F2(t,z,Z) such that
