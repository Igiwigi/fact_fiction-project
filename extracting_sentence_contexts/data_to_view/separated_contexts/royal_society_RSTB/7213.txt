Red, orange, green,
blue-green, and pale shades of these colours, appeared normal; so did the same colours
mixed with black. Yellow was extremely pale; blue was dark blue-grey; mauve was red-
brown; and crimson was replaced by orange. At the time, these facts seemed extremely
puzzling. Now, however, that the details of the reduced colour vision which the retina
assumes under conditions of small visual angle, or of feeble illumination, are known, the
properties of this light are much more easily understood.

(69) The varieties of dichromatism

There are many varieties of dichromatism, which, however, are divisible into two main
categories: (1) complementary dichromatism, in which the two primary colours are com-
plementary to one another and thus produce white when suitably mixed; and (2) non-
complementary dichromatism, in which the two primary colours are not complementary
to one another, and so do not produce white when mixed in any proportion. The first type of dichromatism can readily be witnessed by a normal-sighted observer,
by looking through a colour filter which transmits two parts of the spectrum complemen-
tary to one another, as shown in table 56.
