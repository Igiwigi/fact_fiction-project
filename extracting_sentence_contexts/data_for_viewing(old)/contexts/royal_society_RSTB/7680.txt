entirely independent of the wind. De Lépiney stresses that the wind participates as a vector in
determining the tracks of migrants, but believes their courses are independent of the wind.
Williams minimizes the wind’s role not only as an orientator, but also as a transporter of the
migrants. Recognizing that a correlation between flight directions and prevailing wind
directions often exists, he attributes it to chance, or to a ‘psychological error’ on the part of
observers who unconsciously record flight directions as more accurately against or with the

wind than they in fact are, or tend to classify them into only two categories, against or with
the wind. This tendency cannot be denied, and it means that the accumulated records of
butterfly directions, for example, which show a clear preponderance of flights against or with
the wind, are nevertheless unreliable evidence of any real preference for flight in those
directions. But if such records are valueless for the purpose of revealing a real preference
strong enough to emerge from a mass of records taken under all sorts of conditions, they are
equally valueless for the purpose of revealing something more probable: a preference
exercised in certain circumstances, but not in others. Such records prove neither the
presence nor the absence of active wind orientation.

Both Williams and de Lépiney take the view that, since the direction of migration does not
show a constant relation to the wind direction, some other environmental feature must be
the real key to the orientation of migrants, and that therefore the wind’s possible orienting
