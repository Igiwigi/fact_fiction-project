The factors outside [ _] are essentially aia and do not affect the sign of A, and

it is clear that A can only be positive if $G'— Fe ; is positive. But A must be positive

for secular stability ; hence stability can only = secured by $G—F 3 being positive,

and it is not necessarily so secured. But if this function is positive, so also is {7, 7},
and if this last is positive the system is unstable. Hence stability is always
impossible. As a fact, in all the solutions given above {7,7} is positive, and we
should have to move the spheres much further apart to make it negative, and
therefore on this ground alone the system is always unstable. But A is sometimes
positive and sometimes negative and vanishes for a certain value of \, As the
vanishing of A puzzled me a good deal, I propose to examine the matter further.

Before doing so, however, I will show that the instability of the system may be
concluded from other considerations.

It was proved in §1 that two spheres, unconnected by a pipe, are in limiting
stability when their distance apart is given by
