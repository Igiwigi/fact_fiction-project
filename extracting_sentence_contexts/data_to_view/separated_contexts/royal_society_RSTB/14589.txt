Free-living parasite stages attractor of the resident dynamics, and hence the densities
In our second case, we do not extrinsically ‘force’ fluctuations S*(t), P(t) and P*(t) are limit cycles. We, therefore, must

population could be modelled as follows: period (taken to be 1 above), or perhaps some simple multiple
of it in case of period-doublings.
