conditions, including altered reproductive responses, such imental studies to employ extremely short exposure times =
as mate choice, are crucial in understanding the harmful Ploy y P Ss

(in some cases, only a matter of hours) [2]. This is true even a
though the impacts of pollutants, such as chemical contami-
nants, can take time to manifest. Moreover, there is now
good evidence to suggest that exposure to pollutants can
induce effects that transcend generations by causing develop-
mental changes that are epigenetic [79]. For example, in
laboratory mice, exposure to an endocrine disruptor affects
female mating preferences three generations removed from
the actual exposure [80]. Such studies underscore the fact
that exposure to pollutants need not even be permanent to
exert long-lasting effects on the mate choice process.

In addition, greater emphasis needs to be given to under-
standing the impact of pollutants in interaction with other
environmental stressors. In the wild, animals are typically
confronted with a myriad of environmental challenges simul-
taneously (from both natural and anthropogenic sources).
Yet, despite this, there has been a tendency for researchers
to examine the wildlife impacts of pollution in a vacuum,
isolated from the influence of other environmental factors.
Predicting the response of wildlife to pollutants in the pres-
