are very minute.

In 34 of these 35 cases the changes for the K by NH, replacement are greater
than when potassium is replaced by rubidium, and in 15 of them the changes are
somewhat greater than those which occur when potassium is replaced by czesium.
When all the K by NH, changes are added together (as regards amounts, irrespective
of sign), and the mean taken, in the same manner as was done for the metallic replace-
ments, this average change for the ammonium replacement of potassium is found to
be practically identical with the average change which occurs when potassium is
replaced by cesium; the maximum amount of change observed (for K by NH,) is
also identical with that which occurs for the K by Cs replacement. Thus the angular
effect of replacing potassium by ammonium is of the same order as that of the
weightier metallic interchange, a fact in full keeping with the supposition of the
isomorphism.
