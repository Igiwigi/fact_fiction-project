arranged than the transverse walls, as in the main stalk. On the other side of the fruit,
as we approach the stigma, no regularity of arrangement can be traced, and the
thickening of the polygonal or rounded cells is fairly uniform. In the stigmatic flap
the arrangement in longitudinal rows becomes once more very pronounced.

Preparations of the stigma show the flaps covered on both the inside and the outside
by cutinised cells of approximately isodiametric rounded form, arranged in regular
vertical series. Sometimes these cells form small papille at the surface. Towards the
centre of the fruit the preparation becomes thicker and almost opaque in certain vertical
bands, due to the increase both of the individual cells and of the number of cutinised
cells in the tissue as shown by sections. Adjoining this region a more delicate membrane
is seen, composed of elongated cells with characteristic rounded ends. The membrane
ends irregularly due to the fact that it becomes increasingly thinner as the centre of the

fruit is approached and that it has been torn in the making of the preparation. Some
light is thrown on the nature of these stigmatic membranes in the next section.

The form of all these cells in the epidermal membrane is characteristic and differs from
that seen in Caytonia.

The membranes derived from the seeds are generally fragmentary (PI. 11, figs. 2, 13)
as they are very delicate, and break up when the fruit is opened to extract the seeds.
