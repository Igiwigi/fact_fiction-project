of methanol in zeolites with Si/Al of 11 (present study), 25 [25], 30 [16], 36 [24] and 40 (present
study). MD simulations predict 100% methanol mobility in zeolites [22,23,27], while QENS shows


that the majority of methanol is immobile in the zeolites; e.g. up to 80% methanol is immobile in
ZSM-5-11, as reported in figure 1. The dichotomy of the results derived by the two techniques is
attributed to the time resolutions of the techniques and emphasizes the importance of employing
complementary techniques with identical time resolutions to obtain comprehensive information
of a complex reaction like methanol diffusion dynamics in ZSM-5 pores. Clearly, the relatively
slower methanol diffusivity in the above noted zeolites could not be detected by OSIRIS and IRIS
instruments at ISIS as discussed for ZSM-5-140. In particular, the presence of dominant immobile
methanol results in an intense elastic peak that dominates the quasi-elastic broadening, which
might be lost in the background. This assumption gathers strength by the fact that the zeolite
with Si/Al of 140 shows a significant quasi-elastic component (on the same instrument) when the
majority of methanol is mobile (86% in ZSM-5-140), which minimizes the elastic peak contribution
to a great extent, as discussed in ยง5a (figure 6). In line with this, the higher resolution instrument
IN10 at ILL measures D, of methanol of 10~!! m2 s~! in ZSM-5 with Si/Al of 30, while the lower
resolution instrument IN6 (~1-41 ps) at ILL detects only localized methanol in the zeolite [12]. By

contrast, the intermediate resolution of OSIRIS and IRIS instruments is capable of picking up both : =
the localized and non-localized methanol motions under certain conditions, as demonstrated in : =
ยง2a,b [15,16,24,25,35]. It is noteworthy that the D, (~10-!! m2 s~!) of methanol derived by the : Ss
IN10 instrument is close to the simulated value (*2.2 x 10-10 m2 s-}) for ZSM-5 with Si/ Al of 31, : =
which is comparable with the one employed for experiments at IN10, ILL [12]. DR
