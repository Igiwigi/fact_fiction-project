Thus

(By) = (y) — (By) = (U) — (C) — (By)
= (U) — (B) — (C) + (BC)

or, dividing by (U)

as above.

§ 24. The correctness of the transformations given may, of course, be verified
directly. Thus suppose
Pi < Po < Ps < 05

then the equations to the bounding planes of the congruence-surface are

C= 0 = 0 £2 = 0
OS Pi YI Pil aes
ety+tz=pt+p+p;— 1 ae em
i pl a 2
omy t2=p,
Goby Fe Sp,
If (1—p,) be substituted for p., and (1—ps) for ps, then
Pi <1l—ps<1— py
and the equations must be
x=0 y=0 z4=1—p,— Pps

The set of equations II. may be obtained from the set I. by the transformations
(2) above, thus affording the verification
The fact that the model for wy values of p,, p,, and ps can always be transformed
into a model for the case p, < 0°5, p, < 0°5, ps < 0°5 justifies our terming case
(4), § 20, ‘a type of the most general case.” The geometrical transformations here
suggested would seem to correspond to “ reductions” of the syllogisms. Thus in
fig. 5 the point F stands where the point K stood in fig. 4a. But the point F of fig. 4a
corresponds to a syllogism in Celarent, Cesare, Camenes or Camestres; F in fig. 5 to a
x syllogism in Barbara, The transformation of co-ordinates corresponds toa reduction
S of either of the first four forms to the last.
