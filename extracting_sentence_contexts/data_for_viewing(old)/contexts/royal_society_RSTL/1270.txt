this I found the specific gravity of the wood above the decor-
ticated space. to be 1114, and below it 1111; and the wood
of the unmutilated pole at the same distance from the ground
to be 1112, each being weighed as s0on as it was detached
from the root.

Had the true sap in this instance wholly stagnated above the
decorticated space, the specific gravity of the wood there
ought to have been, according to the result of former experi-
ments,* comparatively much greater ; but I do not wish to
draw any conclusion from a single experiment ; and indeed
I see very considerable d:fficulty in obtaining any very satis-
factory, or decisive facts from any experiments on plants, in
this case, in which the same roots and stems collect and
convey the sap during the spring and summer, and retain,
within themselves, that which: is, during the autumn and
winter, reserved to form new organs of assimilation in the
8ucceeding spring. In the tuberous-rooted plants, the roots
and stems which collect and convey the sap in one season,
and those in which. it is deposited and reserved for the suc-
ceeding season, are perfectly distinct organs ; and from one
of these, the potatoe, I obtained more interesting and decisive
results.

My principal object was to prove that a fluid descends
