columns of the spinal marrow, and the roots arising from them, were distinct in func-

tion, I have met with no instance of disease in the bodies of the yertebre attended
with paraplegia, in which the muscular power of the limbs has not been the first
affected: in all, the defect of motion has been greater than the diminution of sensi-
bility ; in some, the motion of the limbs has been lost, whilst the sensibility has been
exquisitely acute.

These facts, it is now obvious, are to be accounted for by the motor roots of the
spinal nerves being more directly exposed to the influence of the inflammation seated
in the bodies of the vertebre, than the posterior roots of sensation, which arise more
remote from the disease.

In a case now before me, there is disease affecting the bodies of the vertebra of
the neck; the arms hang powerless, whilst the sensibility is perfect; and the patient
walks stoutly. By looking to the roots of the great neryes of the axillary plexus, in
the dead body, the cause of this is manifest ; we see that the motor roots coyer the
spinal marrow, and that, whilst they protect the body of the spinal marrow, they are
exposed themselves, by their proximity, to participate in the inflammation of the bone.
When a section of the spine and sheath of the spinal marrow is made, especially in
the neck or in the loins, it is observed that not only do the anterior roots of the
