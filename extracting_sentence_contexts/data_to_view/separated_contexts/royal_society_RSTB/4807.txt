EXIT of Antennal Gland
Text-Fia. 2.—Diagrammatic front view of Antennal Gland. Owing to this fact and the fact that there are no differentiated walls to the lumen, in
transverse sections of the larve, the efferent duct cell was not recognised as such for
a considerable time. Its more lateral portion, together with the nucleus, appeared
as a typical mesenchyme cell that occur throughout the body. The exceedingly thin
median wall appeared as a minute connecting strand running from the loop cells to
the ectoderm.
