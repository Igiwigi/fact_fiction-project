The general appearance of the animal has now become less delicate, the
head has acquired a darker colour, and a faint broad brown patch (p) is now making
its appearance at the anterior part of the seventh seginent. This patch, which is
permanent through all the earlier changes of the animal, is of the greatest utility in
determining the production of the new segments. It is in the segment immediately
posterior to this that the male organs find their outlet, a circumstance the more re-
markable, from the fact that this outlet is in the anterior part of the original germi-
nal space, and that at the bursting of the egg this is very near the termination of the
body. This was the condition of the young Iulus one hour (fig. 10.)
