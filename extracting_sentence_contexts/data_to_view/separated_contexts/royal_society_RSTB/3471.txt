Even in surface-view
it was apparent that the posterior boundary of the primitive knot is sharply
distinguishable from the streak (cf. fig. 23, Plate 6). And study of sectional
anatomy shows that the tissue of the knot is, in fact, distinguishable from that
of the streak immediately behind it. Text-fig. 10, p. 78, will afford a general conception of the axial relationships
of the parts in question.
