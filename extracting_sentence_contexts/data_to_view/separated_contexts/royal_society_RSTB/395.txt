ingly, we find in Mrs. Barper’s experiments that pale green and yellowish and
purplish-brown all acted as stimuli and produced pupz of corresponding colours, but
that scarlet could not act as a stimulus (except to the formation of a small part of
the colour), and that the resulting pups were not scarlet, but were of the commonest
deep green colour. It is interesting to note the completeness of the failure of the
stimulus in this instance, for the purplish-brown pupz, if produced, would have been
far less conspicuous on the scarlet cloth than the pups: which were actually produced. And similar facts are to be found in these experiments upon V. wrticw, when the
larvee were surrounded by green surfaces, which, in this species, do not act as stimuli. Therefore it is of great interest to collect careful notes of the pupze suspended from
the food-plant, especially when experiments have been made upon others of the same
series. The pup of this series were of the following colours :—

Of the 15 pups suspended from the food-plant, 5 were . .
