Reptilia the three main arterial trunks come off separately from the ventricle, while
in the Tuatara they come off from a short common trunk, probably representing the
conus arteriosus of the Amphibia which has been lost in other Reptilia. Sphenodon possesses both a ductus caroticus and a ductus arteriosus (BoraLit) on
each side, and they are in a moderately developed condition. That this is a primitive
condition is shown by the fact that it occurs in the Amphibia Urodela, and is not
found, so far as is known, in any other reptile. The carotids, in origin and general
distribution, and also in the absence of a common trunk, Â¢.e., a carotis primaria,
resemble those of the Urodele Amphibia, and also some of the primitive Lacertilia. The same is also true of the arteria laryngeo-trachealis, which comes off from the

ag pulmonary artery in Amphibia and in certain Lizards.
