nucleus rotundus vagi of WINKLER was observed.
: The motor nuclei of the medulla.—The nucleus hypoglossus presents no feature worthy
: of comment. It is large and easily identified. Its cells are enormous, eclipsed by none
in this region except those of the tegmentum proper. Fibres from the fasciculus longi-
tudinalis medialis may be easily seen entering it—while many fibres from the surround-
ing formatio reticularis connect with it. No individual divisions of the hypoglossal
nucleus were recognisable.

The nucleus abducens is found in its typical relationship to the genu of the nervus
facialis and the fasciculus longitudinalis medialis. The dorsal tegmental bundle of
Scutirz, which lies dorsal toit in the ventral grey, is enlarged and connects it closely
with the nucleus of the third and fourth nerves. In spite of the fact that in Platypus
the eyes themselves are exceptionally small, the connections between their motor
nuclei are, on the contrary, exceptionally large.

The nucleus ambiguus was identified with some difficulty. It is not as prominent
a group of cells as reported in Echidna (Kaprrers, 1920, vol. 2, Abs. 1, fig. 275, p. 527),
or as the author has seen in the opossum. No fibre connections were identified. The
nucleus is what WINKLER calls the nucleus ventralis of the ninth, tenth and eleventh
nerves. Its position and relation to other motor elements appear similar to other
mammals described. The ill-defined dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus contains small
cells lying dorso-medially within it and large cells ventro-laterally. In its anterior end,
the latter cells are separated from the former by connective tissue septa in such a way
that the large cells have the appearance of a separate nucleus. This cell-mass resembles
