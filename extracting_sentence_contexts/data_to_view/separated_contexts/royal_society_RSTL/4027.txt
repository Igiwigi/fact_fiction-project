In this year it occurred to me, that it might be interesting to determine what
difference, as to the-amount of produce, would be produced by planting in one in-

* It can hardly, I think, be denied, that juices are excreted from the roots, as well as taken up by them ;
the only question is, are these excretions injurious to the plants of the same species which grew in the soil

afterwards, and if they are, are they favourable to the growth of others ? The first of these positions may be
countenanced by the facts detailed in the text, but the latter is little, if at all, corroborated by them,
