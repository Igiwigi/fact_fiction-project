.c, e) reduce itself to the form

(Å¿edz...4)=(@... +&+&Y*7, The assumptions upon which this last condition is obtained are perhaps UNNeCcesSAry ;
instead of the condition in the foregoing form we, in fact, use only the condition that
the prepotential vanishes for a point at infinity, that is when all or any one or more
of the coordinates ( . . . c, 6) are or is infinite. Again, as we have seen, the prepotential V must satisfy the prepotential equation
