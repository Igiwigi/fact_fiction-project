A linking system is thus set up consisting of :—
particle—orientated wetting molecule—cation—orientated wetting molecule—particle.*

As removal of water proceeds, an increasing proportion of cations share their water
envelopes with two clay particles, and so the number of links increases. The links also
become stronger, because they become shorter and the mean orientating couple on the
water molecules increases. In consequence, the cohesion of the clay particles, 1.e., the
hardness of the crumbs, increases.

The hypothesis involves two assumptions, which have not yet been directly tested,
though there is some indirect evidence in their favour :—

(1) that a system of the type postulated is in fact mechanically stable ;
(2) that the number of cations dissociating from a clay particle in a system that is
losing water decreases less rapidly than the number of water molecules.

The hypothesis accounts for the formation of crumbs by other polar liquids as well as
water, and for their non-formation by non-polar liquids. It also explains the necessity
for the clays to possess dissociating cations, i.e., base exchange capacity.

Further, it explains the observed relation between the hardness of the aggregates and
the size of the clay particles, the cations and the molecules of the wetting liquid. For the
smaller the clay particles, the larger the number of links per unit volume between them,
provided the surface of the clay particle be curved and not plane. Again, a large
univalent cation, such as the phenyl-benzyl-dimethyl-ammonium ion, has a much smaller
