This is a very rough measurement, for the curve in fig. 9
is only based on a few determinations of K, still it probably gives an indication of the
order of change in the hydrogen-ion concentration of the blood at high altitudes. Such a change would of course tend to increased ventilation. It is not necessary to
go into the literature of this question, the increased ventilation is well known to exist
and is in fact the counterpart of the decrease in the alveolar CO,. ‘The actual
amount of CO, which leaves the body is not reduced. The whole question is discussed
in a paper by Campseti, Doveras, HALDANE and Hopson (‘ Journ, Physiol.,’ vol. 46,
p- 316), to which the reader is referred. These authors conclude that the difference
in reaction of the blood at Pike's Peak and at Oxford should correspond to the
addition of 0°8 mm.
