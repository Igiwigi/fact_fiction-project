In the course of the day the creature was killed by a would be scien-
tific friend of mine, with the intention of preserving its skin; and on opening the body
the ovaries were found to be clustered with ova in different stages of growth ; but none
of them 80 large as the eggs which were laid. These eggs were white, soft, and with-
out shell, easily compressible, and about the size of a crow's egg. « Not being sufficiently versed in the 8ubject T am not prepared to say whether these
eggs might not have been abortions caused by fear, but there was no appearance on the
surface of their ever having been vascularly connected with the maternal uterus, and
reviewing all the facts observed I should undoubtedly say that the animal was oviparous. *«T am, dear Sir,
