By maintaining these asswmed discriminating or separating values (forming the cri-
teria whereby each observation was as8igned either to the disturbed or to the undisturbed
category), constant at each 8tation, the laws of disturbance in different months and
different years, if such laws existed, might be studied with convenience and security ;
and by s0 adjusting the values adopted at the different stations as to cause the number
of the disturbed obseryations at each station to bear nearly an equal proportion to the

whole body, an advance might be made towards an approximate estimate of the degree
in which the disturbing action prevailed in different parts of the globe. In the prac-
tical application of this scheme of first or primary analysis it was found that, provided
the elected separating value at each station were such as to place in the category of
disturbed observations a proportion equivalent to between one and two tenths of the
whole body of the observations, s8mall alterations within these limits occasioned no
8ignificant alterations in the derived diurnal progression either of the disturbed or of
the (for the most part) undisturbed observations,
The monthly records of a single year at any one of the observatories sufficed to mani-
fest an order and gequence in the ratios of the aggregate amounts of disturbance in each
Q of the twenty-four hours to the mean amount in the twenty-four hours taken as unity,
© Which placed beyond a doubt the fact that, casual and irregular as the disturbances
Z might appear in respect to the particular times of their occurrence when viewed in single
S days, they were in their mean effects strictly periodical phenomena; exhibiting, by the *
E character of their periodical variations, « dependence on the $un as their primary Source. 2 To this important fact the disturbances of each of the magnetic elements, the Declina-
& tion, the Inclination, and the Intensity of the magnetic force, bore concurrent testimony,
Z although the hours of maximum and minimum of their respective diurnal progressions
S were dissimilar; confirming in that particular the inference of the existence of distinct
S periodical laws in the disturbances of each of the elements.
