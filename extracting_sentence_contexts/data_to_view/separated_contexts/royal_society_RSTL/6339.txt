Nevertheless the clay and sand have been s0 much washed
over the surface of the wall that it is impossible to do more than this; hence it was

were carefully measured; a sample, and when necessary more than one, of every bed
was taken, each in a separate box, and every important fact, as to the character of the
bed and the occurrence or not of fossils in it, was carefully noted. The mean of the
several measurements, all yery near the average, gave a dip of 12Z* towards S. 35* W.
