Now in (59) the condition h = 0 (r = 1) holds only at the lower rim of the periphery ;
further from (55) the condition y = 0 implies rest or no acceleration. â€˜Thus strictly
interpreted equation (58) can only be accepted as holding in general at the lower rim,
and as holding in particular over the whole curved surface when there is rest or no

acceleration. It would seem that the term (- Y a) is the measure of an outstanding

stress at the periphery. During acceleration from (55) y is positive and the outstanding
stress is a pressure, during retardation y is negative and the outstanding stress is a
traction. Qualitatively considered they would be precisely the types of stress required
to deal with a fictitious layer adhering to the surface to retain it in position during

motion.
It is now necessary to enquire the order of error likely to be introduced by neglect of

the term including the space variable. Rewrite (57) as

aby = KR, {1-4}

where the greatest value of h is unity, and

y=epHD Ry 2. - ee ee te (55)
The quantity under investigation is of the order
