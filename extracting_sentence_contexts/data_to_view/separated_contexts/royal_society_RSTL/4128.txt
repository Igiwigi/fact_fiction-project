Similar bubbles were collected as before, and the
gas in an eudiometer contracted to 0'7. On repetition the experiment did not succeed
80 well, and upon seyeral repetitions it s0metimes succeeded and sometimes failed, and
I should not mention it but that it was the first experiment which gave me, although
not very satisfactorily, the effect of decomposition by heat alone. The reason of its
uncertainty I believe to have been the want of a sufficiently intense heat, as I dared
not venture on account of the gold solder to push the ignition very far; in fact, I sab-
sequently fused the extremity and spoiled the apparatus by applying the oxybydrogen
flame to it; had the platinum tube been welded instead of gold-soldered, it would
doubtless have sncceeded better. I should state that the object of the silver tube
was to prevent the chance of recomposition by the catalytic effect of a large platinum
Surface ; to have, in short, a small portion of platinum exposed to the steam, and that
at a high temperature : economy was also no indifferent consideration. This expe-
riment, although, coupled with the previous ones, tolerably conclusive, did not satisfy
me, and I attacked the difficulty in another manner.
