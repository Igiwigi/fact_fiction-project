It must be remem-
bered, however, that our theory of the constitution is not yet complete. For
instance, in [IL] it was seen that the supposition that N was not constant for the
p-sequence, but that the value for the first line was slightly larger explained the
introduction of a term in the denominator. A similar explanation might explain the
fact that the value of q appears to deviate from the mean by about the same amount
in each group of elements, and if it were justified, the value of q calculated as above
would receive a slight modification. I believe it will be found ultimately that the
true value will lie within the limits given by 361°890+°05 or 90°4725+°0125. If the existence of the oun as a definite proportion of the (atomic weight)’ be
considered as: established, the best and most direct method of determining the value
of the factor g would be from the discussion of an element in which the spectroscopic
data are good and in which the atomic weight has been determined with great
accuracy.
