ture, or to inequalities in their thickness, arising from my
own inexpertness in grinding and polishing their surfaces ;
and it was not till habit had rendered me familiar with all the
usual causes of deception, that, finding the same phenomena
uniformly repeated in different and perfect specimens, my
curiosity became excited to enquire into their cause, the more

unanswerable objection to the theory of M. Btor, above al-
luded to, which affords so perfect an explanation of the tints
m crystals with one axis.

These phenomena have not escaped the vigilance of Dr.
BREWSTER. In his paper of 1818, he distinctly notices the fact
of a deviation from Newton's scale, in crystals with two axes,
and promises a more detailed account of it, which however has
not yet appeared. But the object of the present communication
is not thereby anticipated, as in the only passage in that paper

in which he expresses himself otherwise than obscurely on its
cause, he appears to regard the deviated tints as analogous
to those developed along the axis of rock crystal and by cer-
tain liquids; an analogy which, in the present state of our
