The collection of Visser rules consists of the rules V,, for every n.

Theorem 2.13. Let T be a theory with L(T) =IPC. If the Visser rules are admissible in T, then the
admissible rules of T are exactly those of IPC.

Proof. Let A and B be propositional formulas. By theorem 2.11, it suffices to show that if A Ftpc
B, then A fr B. So assume that A ypc B. By a theorem of Iemhoff ({10], Theorem 3.9), this means
that A Hpc B, where Hpc denotes the derivability relation of IPC extended with all of Visser's
rules. In other words, there is a proof tree, potentially using A as a premise, all steps in which
are instances of the rules of IPC and V, and whose conclusion is B. Given that Visser’s rules are
admissible in T, and using the fact that T is based on intuitionistic logic, it is straightforward
