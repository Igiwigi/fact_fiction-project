Nevertheless, it must be noted that the results obtained by various observers differ
appreciably. According to CLaRKE('), the values obtained by Mortry and Noyes,
by reason of the accuracy of their methods and the close concordance of the individual
determinations, outweigh the results of all other investigators. The atomic weight
of oxygen being 16, that of hydrogen, according to Mortry(’), is 1°00762, and
according to Noyes(*), 1°00787. (Cnarkr, on Noyes’ data, prefers the value
100783.) It is, further, a significant fact that the arithmetic mean of all determina-
tions discussed by CLARKE, lies between these two values, which differ by 1 part in
4000. Both values are based on the gravimetric synthesis of water and are indepen-
dent of a knowledge of the densities of the gases. A physico-chemical method of determining the relative molecular weights depends
on the knowledge of the ratio of the densities, together with that of the combining
volumes.
