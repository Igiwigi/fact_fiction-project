The value changes with a change of geographical position. From the values of #, D and A we may also determine how much of the heeling error
arises from the transverse 8oft iron represented in the figures 3, 4 & 5, and how

much from the vertical soft iron and the hard iron, the first =(D+ z=1) tan 0 ©,

the second = (i z) tan 07”; and these two parts are tabulated in the next columns. If we have not an opportunity of observing the vertical force on a sufficient number
of points to obtain its mean value, the values observed will be affected by soft iron
represented by the rod g, in the following figure :—

Habulated; 9 does not change with a change of geographical position.

& In comparing the heeling error when the 'ship's head is North or South, we must
Seware of falling into the error of confusing the two senses in which these words may
Se used. It may seem most natural to suppose the ship's head to be North or South
Shen upright, and that she is then heeled over without altering her direction.
