On BgrGman's suppo-
Sition, it can hardly be imagined but that cases will sometimes occur, where A has 80
strong an affinity for B, or C 80 powerful an attraction for D, that on mixing AB
and CD, no interchange will take place, although AD may be an insoluble body. On BzrraoLLeT's Supposition, the insoluble compound will always be wholly precipi-
tated whenever by the interchange of acids and bases such a compound can be
formed, even though it be against the preponderating direction of the affinities. Now
this can be put. at once to the test of experience: and what is the testimony of the
thousands of double decompositions which chemists are in the habit of meeting with :
Granant says, © It is a general law to which there is no exception, that two soluble
salts cannot be mixed without the occurrence of decomposition, if one of the pro-
ducts that may be formed is an insoluble alt.” Gmzranf, even when arguing
against BerTaoLLeT's views, admits the same fact, adding, © the only case which

* Yet it is easily conceivable that when the affinity for each other of the two substances that produce the
insoluble compound is very weak, the action may last some time, and become evident to our senses. Is not
this actually the case when sulphate of lime in solution is added to nitrate of strontia, or carbonate of soda to
chloride of calcium, or an alkaline carbonate to tartrate of yttria, or oxalate of ammonia to sulphate of mag-
nesia, &c,?
