the long
course which the smaller ramifications take without giving off branches. I have ob-
served one which ran 2th of an inch without giving off any branches, and another
which gave off only one branch in a course of 45th of an inch. When we take into
consideration this fact, and remember also how minute the terminal extremities of
the ducts become, and that they are not unfrequently seen distinctly closed, it will
appear quite certain that the ducts can have no actual connection with the surround-
ing parenchyma, 80 as to envelope and contain it in their terminal expansions, as
some have suppozed. The real relation of the ducts to the parenchyma is, I think,
well shown by a peculiarity in their condition which I have noticed as of tolerably
frequent occurrence ; when this exists there are found in the parenchyma numerous
masses of more or less deep biliary tinge, consisting apparently of large yellow gra-
nules enclosed in an envelope ; when a duct is dissected out, these yellow masses are
found adhering to it at various parts of its circumference ; they are manifestly not
in the cavity of the duct, but simply adherent to it. That these yellow masses origi-
nate in the secreting parenchyma is I think indubitable; they evidently consist of
biliary matter ; but this seems to have undergone some change, which has rendered it
incapable of being readily absorbed by the ducts, and it thus remains on the exterior,
indicating as it were the route it would normally pursne.
