The connection of the dynamical character of Friedmann models with the observations showing
an overall expansion was done a few years later. G. Lemaitre in 1927 [27] combined the Friedmann
models with the phenomenon of redshift, calculating for the first time the constant in the
‘Hubble’s law’ v = Hr, connecting the distance to recession velocity, found by Hubble two years
later.

The 1927 paper of Lemaitre was translated into English in [28] after a suggestion of Eddington
(for this amazing story that made Lemaitre ‘the most well-known theoretical cosmology of the
day’, see [29]). In that same 1927 paper, Lemaitre had also shown that the Einstein static universe


was unstable, small irregularities would in fact grow in time. The resulting Lemaitre universe has
the property of coasting as static an infinite time in the past, before expanding and accelerating
like de Sitter’s universe in the future (this instability of the Einstein static world was also shown
independently a few years later by A. Eddington [30], and this universe is sometimes called the
Eddington-Lemaitre cosmology).

Sometimes by Lemaitre universe, we mean one that starts with a big bang (reserving the
infinite coasting static period for the Eddington—-Lemaitre model), then passes through a finite
hesitation period where it is described by the Einstein static universe and then ends with a
‘whimper’ expanding like a de Sitter space into the future.

Lemaitre also appears to be the first to connect the cosmological constant to the energy of the
vacuum in a paper published in 1934 [31], now related to what is termed dark energy.
