the torsional vibrations, this would not be the case ; but, as a matter of fact, even if
we could start the wire without any pendulous motion, the axis of the wire never
exactly passes through the centre of mass, and, as a consequence, when the wire
vibrates torsionally, s0-called © centrifugal force ” canses torsional motion to be
partially converted into pendulous motion, or vice vers. When, as in Experiment I., the period of pendulous vibration does not approxi-
mately synchronise with the period of torsional vibration, the phenomenon is not very
pronounced; but when, as in Experiment II., the two periods approach to synchronism,
it is very apparent. Indeed, when the two periods approach sufficiently to synchro-
nism, and the damping is not great, the phenomenon may become 80 marked that,
after a time, almost the whole of the torsional motion becomes converted into
pendulous motion, and presently reconverted again, s0 that the torsional vibrations,
= having firsb diminished to nearly zero, begin to increase again until nearly the initial
'S amplibude has been reached, when once more the torsional motion begins to be con-
