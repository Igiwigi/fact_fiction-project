Yet another but smaller T, maximum is seen experimentally at the
electron count of 6.5 [9,36]. Remarkably, both discussed d-electron counts coincide with the
well-known borderlines between the bec/hep and hep/fce structures of elemental transition
metals [44]. This correlation is not casual, we think, and it emphasizes the fact that the same
lattice instabilities that drive structural distortions at room temperature may also be at the
origin of the strong electron-phonon coupling in those transition metals which superconduct at
low temperature.

7. Concluding remarks

Our aim here is to highlight this approach for the transition metal series and in particular a
qualitative account of the T, systematics of transition metals, most notably the first transition
series. We have highlighted approaches that characterize the strength of the important electronâ€”
phonon interaction in transition metals by two experimentally derived parameters.
