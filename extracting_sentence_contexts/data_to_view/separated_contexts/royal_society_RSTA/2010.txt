The resulting posterior predictions, shown
in figure 2c, give a very narrow bound. By ignoring model discrepancy we have become highly
(and wrongly) certain that the catastrophically bad predictions are correct. It is worth noting that all of the issues above arise from the fact that the model discrepancy
was ignored during calibration. In the scenario of no model discrepancy, i.e. when fitting Model T
to the data, none of the issues above occurred, as shown in electronic supplementary material,
figure S1. To conclude our motivation of this paper, we can see that neglecting discrepancy in the modelâ€™s
equations is dangerous and can lead to false confidence in predictions for a new context of use.
