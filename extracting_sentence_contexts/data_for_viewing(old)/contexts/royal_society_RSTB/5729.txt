decide what should be called “‘ separate ” strains, and if our correlation table is over-
weighted with substrains from one line in which small-broodedness and high E-ness
happen to coincide we shall be apt to find a spurious relationship. Table 6 shows a
series of « and ¢ strains worked out with this danger in mind. It seems clear that,
comparing one strain with another, E-ness and brood size are inversely related to one
another, though the intensity of the association indicated by the coefficient of correlation
of — 0-65 must be qualified by the fact that the relationship is not linear (fig. 4). Among
the available « strains the relationship is not demonstrable.
