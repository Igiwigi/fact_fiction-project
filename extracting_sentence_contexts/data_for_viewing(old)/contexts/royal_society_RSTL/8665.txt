'= brain. The hernia was only slightly elevated above the rest of the hemisphere. The

Zlesion was accurately cireumscribed.

<= The grey matter on the snrface of the superior temporo-sphenoidal convolution was

S destroyed throughout the upper two thirds of its extent (7. e. the extent which reacts

to electrical stimulation).

S The base of the brain, ganglia, and cranial nerves were intact.

E This experiment (besides confirming the fact of loss of sight by destruction of the

S angular gyrus) serves to localize the effects as to hearing, which were observed to result
from extensive lesions of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe. It is obviously more difficult
to ascertain the presence or absence of the sense of hearing in the lower animals than in
man, on account of the difficulty of distinguishing between reflex action and true
8ensory perception.

In the above experiments, involving destruction of the superior temporo-sphenoidal
convolution, it will be seen that, with the exception of an occasional start to a shrill
sound, in general there was an abolition of reaction to sounds which in normal condi-
tions are sufficient to excite active attention, and this while the animals were on the
alert and in full possession of their other senses.
