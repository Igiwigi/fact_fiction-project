phases of the periodicities of nearly 11 years are in arithmetical progression such as
we should expect if the main period were homogeneous. :

Reference to Table IV. shows a decided maximum corresponding to a period of
5째625 years in the second half of the complete time interval. This is undoubtedly _
to a great extent due to the first sub-period of the 11째125-year cycle, though the
displacement in time is greater than it should be. This maximum seems to exist to
a much smaller degree in the first half of the interval. Further features of the table
and curves will be referred to later.

The periodicity corresponding to the time of revolution of Jupiter (11째86 years)
has been examined, but reference to Table IV. shows that there is no evidence of a
periodicity connected with the orbital revolution of that planet. In fact, we may
definitely assert that no influence directly traceable to Jupiter exists.

7. It has been stated that in the absence of definite periods the expectancy of the
intensity of the periodogram must be obtained from the periodogram itself in all
cases where the events to be analysed are not, as regards their succession, independent
of each other. The expectancy not depending on the period, we may select for the
purpose any portion of the curve in which we have no reason to suspect any
periodicities. The portion most suitable for this purpose in our case is that lying
between 54 days and 1째5 years. Shorter periods must be avoided, because if the
length is only a few days the intensity of the periodogram is depressed, owing to the
fact that sunspots as a rule last several days. That this is so may easily be
