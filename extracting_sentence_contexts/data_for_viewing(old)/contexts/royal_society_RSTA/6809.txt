according to (23). Since r/a appears in that equation, the ‘relaxation pattern’ is
different for every row of nodes parallel to Oz. For example, when 7) = 3a so that
7 = 13 = 3a, ry = 4a, ry = 2a, the effects of unit displacement at 0 (i.e. dé) = 1) are
easily seen to be

AF,=—4, AF,=4F,=1, 4F,=+, 4AF,=4, (24)
—summing neae but not exactly} to zero. Allowance for one or more short strings in an
‘irregular star’ is easily made (if required) ¢ on the basis of ‘fictitious nodes’ lying outside
the boundary.

14. Except that a variety of ‘relaxation patterns’ is entailed, the liquidation process
follows exactly on the lines described in previous papers of this series, and it presented
no difficulty in the example which follows. (This was treated by D. N. de G. A.)

Example 1. Torsion of a tore of square section

The side of the square section was taken as the governing dimension L, and a was
given the values 1/8, 1/16 in successive nets. Figure 3 records the accepted values of ¢
as computed on the final net, also contours of ¢ obtained from cross-plottings.§ It
follows from (1) that these contours coincide at every point with the direction of the
