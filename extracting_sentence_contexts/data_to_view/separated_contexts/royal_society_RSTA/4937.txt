as a whole, and the energy due to the motion of the atoms relatively to the centre of

gravity of the molecule. If f is the ratio of the rate of increase of the internal energy to that of the trans-

lational energy, we have the well-known equation—
B+1=2/{3(y— 1h,
where y is the ratio of the specific heats of the gas,
