two different organisms can stably coexist and even give
rise to a new type of organism, traces to Simon Schwendener
[9], a Swiss botanist who discovered that lichens consist
of a fungus and a photosynthesizer. The German botanist
Heinrich Anton de Bary (1878) coined the term ‘Symbiose’
to designate this type of coexistence [10]. Schimper [11] is
sometimes credited with the discovery of endosymbiotic
theory, but his treatise of the topic is wholly contained in a
footnote that translates to this: ‘If it can be conclusively con-
firmed that plastids do not arise de novo in egg cells, the
relationship between plastids and the organisms within
which they are contained would be somewhat reminiscent of
a symbiosis. Green plants may in fact owe their origin to the
unification of a colorless organism with one uniformly tinged
with chlorophyll’ [11, pp. 112-113]. That was all he wrote on
the possibility of symbiotic plastid origin. The sentence
immediately following that one in Schimper’s famous footnote,
however, is also significant, as we will see in a later passage
about Portier and the symbiotic origin of mitochondria; it trans-
lates to this: ‘According to Reinke (Allg. Botanik, p. 62) the
chlorophyll bodies [Chlorophyllk6rner, another name for plas-
tids in Schimper’s day] might even have the ability to live
independently; he observed this phenomenon, as communi-
cated to me, and published with kind permission, in a rotting
pumpkin, the chloroplastids of which, surrounded by Pleospor-
