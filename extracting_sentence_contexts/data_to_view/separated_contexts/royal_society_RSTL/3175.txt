In the course of the present summer
my attention has been directed to apply similar means to the detection of
metallic poisons, a subject of acknowledged and increasing importance ; and
the results I have obtained, and now beg leaye to submit to the Society, appear
to me both noyel and interesting, and afford, if I mistake not, means more
simple, delicate, and effectual, than any at present known for detecting the
common metallic poisons. The fear of trespassing too much on the time of the Society, induces me to
limit the present paper to one part only of the subject. At no distant period
I promise myself the pleasure of communicating the remaining part, which
will embrace the different electro-chemical experiments I have made on the
other metals and their compounds, together with the application of the facts
to the processes of gilding, silvering, tinning, &c. In the following pages I shall notice the simple electro-chemical apparatus,
(or electro-chemical method as I shall call it,) employed in my experiments ;
offer proofs of its efficacy to detect different metals, particularly metallic
poisons ; adduce instances of the extreme delicacy and facility of the method ;
and lastly, show, by similar evidences, that its accuracy is not impaired by the
presence of organic substances whether vegetable or animal, or mixtures of
both ; and that the method is therefore applicable to the detection of metallic
poisons in all cases. TI shall be under the necessity of making some minute
(and I fear tedious) details, which I trust will be excused, as they are closely
connected with the elucidation of the snbject.
