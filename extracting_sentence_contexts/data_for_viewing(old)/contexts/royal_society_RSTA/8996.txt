Any lines of the F type up to m=4 will unfortunately lie in the ultra-violet
beyond the observed region. F (4) should be 36690, and the largest frequency
observed by Watson is (1) 36536. The others should be weak and in a region where
glass apparatus would only allow strong lines to be registered. F (5) should be at
35148°01+2¢ but is not seen. The line 35259'2 is about a v link ahead, in fact
».35259°2 = 35152°4. It may, however, be noticed that 36536 above is just 154
behind the expeeted F (4), so that it is the F line corresponding to the parallel F set
above with the separation 156 (say F’). In the same series is also found
F (6) = (2):34087'1 corresponding to the F’ (6) =29196.u. These are of value in
that it gives the means of determining the limit with great exactness. Denote the
parallel series by F’. For m = 2 using B.M.M.’s measure for F’(2) the separation is
17081'46+0—16925'43+°05 = 156°03+'05. For m= 5 both lines have been
measured interferentially and the separation is 28553°342—28397°167 = 156°175,
eorrect to the second decimal place. The two separations differ by more than the
allowable observation error, and is possibly due to the common change in sequent for
series with different limits. In these cases in the separation with the larger m, this
effect is very small. Consequently we are justified in taking the separation as 156717 +0.
