Thus it is seen that the arm lengths of the larvee developed at 23° are respective
31:0 per cent. and 7°8 per cent. longer than those developed at 20°, whilst the ra
is increased by 5 per cent. at 23°. These values are very similar to those give
in the former table, where means of all the observations are taken.

When discussing the effect of temperature on the body length of the larvee, it y
noticed that an increase in the temperature during development from 20° to 2
caused about 2 per cent. decrease in size. Where the temperature fell below 18
there was also a decrease in the body length. We arrive, therefore, at the interestin
fact that one and the same change in the environment produces a different effect
each of the parts of the larva subjected to measurement. It causes a decrease
the body length, a considerable increase in the aboral arm length, and a slighte
increase in the oral arm length. This is in some ways a remarkable conclusion, for
follows that all the tissues of the body of a comparatively simple organism
the pluteus are never at one and the same time adapted in the most favou
manner possible to their environmental conditions. If a condition is favou
to the growth of one portion of the tissues it is unfavourable to the growth
another portion.

It has been shown that the body length of the larve is reduced by
4 or 5 per cent. by keeping the ova at about 8° or 25° during the time of impr
nation. It appears that the arm lengths are affected to a larger extent @
