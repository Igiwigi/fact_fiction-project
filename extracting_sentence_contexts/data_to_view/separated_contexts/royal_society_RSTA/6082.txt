Causal emergence as information conversion

Given the evidence that information conversion can occur at macroscales, even in a well-
understood baseline measure like the mutual information, it is next necessary to establish what
it means and how it relates to other information-theoretic approaches to emergence. How does
it play out in measures like the effective information, which was specifically designed to capture
causal influence and can peak at a macroscale? A hint comes from the already well-established fact that the effective information (EI) changes
across scales due to a change in determinism and/or degeneracy [8,10,18]. Indeed, it is already
proven that:

EU(X;Y) = > J P(x, y) logy (seeps) | P(X) =H™, (4.1)
xEeX yey


which differs from the normal mutual information calculation in that P(X) is set to H™**, and can 8 |
be rewritten as

Effective information = determinism — degeneracy. (4.2) Ss

In this interpretation of the effective information, the determinism is based on the information 28.

lost via uncertainty in state transitions:
determinism = log,(N) — (H(p(y) | P(X) =H™*)). (4.3)

The term log,(N) can be understood as the uncertainty about the future state of a maximally
entropic system with N unique states. The second term (H(p(y) | P(X) = H™**)) gives the average
uncertainty about the future state of our real system X (note that this is applied over a single
timestep, e.g. t to t, 1).
