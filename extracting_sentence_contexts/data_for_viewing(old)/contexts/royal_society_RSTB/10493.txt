The timing of meiosis in the germline of animals has been
intensively investigated. Whereas male meiosis occurs continu-
ously, female meiosis usually stops twice (figure 1). These
‘meiotic arrests’ are under the control of various factors that
are not completely identified across animals [95-97]. Arrest 1
occurs in prophase I during early development and can last
years until sexual maturity. The timing of arrest 2 is more vari-
able (ranging from metaphase I in many invertebrates, to
metaphase II in vertebrates and G1 phase after meiosis II in
some echinoderms), and may have evolved to prevent the
risk of premature parthenogenetic cleavage of oocytes or inap-
propriate DNA replication before fertilization [97,98]; this is
supported by the fact that this arrest is usually released by fer-
tilization. However, the evolutionary significance of its precise
timing in diverse groups is not well understood. Three ideas
have been put forward to explain arrest 1 [66]. First, its occur-
rence at prophase I may allow the repair of accidental DSBs by
sister chromatid exchange during long periods between arrests
1 and 2. Second, if arrest 1 was to occur during an earlier mito-
tic division within the germline, this might decrease the
variance in the number of deleterious mutations among
gametes within individuals, which may be detrimental if
some defective gametes or early embryos can be eliminated
and replaced during reproduction. Third, it may be easier to
prevent uncontrolled proliferation in a non-dividing meiotic
