In the 11 weeks chick all the oocytes over
100» exhibit a more advanced stage of atresia. I conclude, therefore, that all those
oocytes, which enter upon the period of rapid growth between the third and sixth week,
are abnormal and fated to become atretic without ever reaching maturity. They have,
in fact, entered precociously upon the growth stage (the intra-follicular growth stage
of D’HotianpeEr) and by the sixth week all are showing signs of atresia. As the atretic
condition is much more advanced in all the oocytes over 100% in diameter in the
11 weeks chick, we can assume that no more oocytes enter upon a period of precocious
growth between the sixth and eleventh week after hatching. Further, although the
smallest precocious oocytes of the 6 weeks chick grow a little during this period, as
is shown by the increase of 33} per cent.
