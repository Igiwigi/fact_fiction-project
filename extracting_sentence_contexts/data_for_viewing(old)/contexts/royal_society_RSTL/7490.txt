to measure the hypoxulphite. The relation between the two reactions which occur
simultaneously in this determination is strictly parallel to that between the reaction of
hydric peroxide and hydric iodide, which forms the subject, and the reaction of iodine

and hyposulphite, which furnishes the method of our investigation. But whereas hydric
peroxide acts on hydric iodide much more slowly than iodine acts on hyposulphite, hydric
permanganate appears under the same cireumstances to form iodine even more rapidly
than it is reduced. $0 that in this case it is possible actually to see the double reaction,
for each drop of permanganate as it enters the fluid devyelopes for an instant the colour
of iodine. But the fact of the alternate action is proved independently of this obserya-
tion ; for while, as has been stated, the result obtained by the addition of permanganate
to the mixture of hydric iodide and hyposulphite is the same as that obtained when the
two reactions are caused to occur successively, the result of the direct action of hydric
permanganate on hydric hyposulphite is widely different.

The relation between the measure of peroxide and the drops of hyposulphite may also
Abe determined in another manner. It is possible at the close of the actual set of expe-
Zriments, having allowed the liquid in the cylinder to stand until the action has come
Epractically to an end, to determine the excess of hyposulphite by means of a standard
Ssolution of iodine or permanganate, and then to determine by the same means the value
of an entire drop subsequently added. Hence we know what fraction of a drop, in
Saddition to the entire drops previously introduced, has been required to reduce the whole
