displaying whether regional changes in climate extremes at 1.5째C versus 2째C of global warming
are significantly different. These analyses are provided for the four climate extreme indices
considered in figures 3-5, i.e. TXx, TNn, Rx5day and CDD. As highlighted in Wartenburger
et al. [8] based on ESR-CMIP5 analyses, differences are generally found to be significant for
temperature extremes (for TXx and TNn, in all regions). This is also the case for the results
of the HAPPI simulations (figure 7), and also consistent with recent analyses of health-related


heat extremes [34]. Results are more inconsistent for water cycle extremes, as also previously 8 |
highlighted [8]. However, it is interesting to note that the analyses based on the HAPPI

simulations seem to show more frequently significant changes between the two warming levels, a
also for the water cycle extremes. This could be due to the fact that the larger number of ensemble 2
members per model allows for more robust statistics. On the other hand, it is also possible that 1g
the HAPPI-based ensemble underestimates inter-model uncertainty due to the smaller number of 1s

considered climate models (five) compared to those used in the ESR-CMIP5 estimates (26) and the
prescribed SST conditions (see also previous section). This could be in particular the case for the
estimates of changes in CDD, which are in part inconsistent (also in terms of sign) between the
ESR-CMIP5 and HAPPI estimates (figures 6 and 7), since drought projections are known to be
strongly model-dependent and to display large decadal variability [35].

Overall, these analyses show that significant differences in regional extremes are found :
between a global warming of 1.5째C versus 2째C, especially for temperature extremes, but also for [=
water cycle extremes in several regions. :3
