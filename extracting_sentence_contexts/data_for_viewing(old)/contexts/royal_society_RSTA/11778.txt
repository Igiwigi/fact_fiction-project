the alloy with indium, we observed grey filaments, which were possibly due to the
incorporation of traces of rouge in a network of fissures, although they might also be
attributed to the presence of a cement, and in all cases they deserved attention,

Partial Attack.—It is known that certain alloys of gold, especially those with iron,

zinc, copper, lead, silver, &c., are attacked by certain acids which do not attack the
gold itself.* This fact led us to hope that the use of suitable reagents would afford
useful data. Pure nitric acid (spec. grav. 1°33) was without action in the case of twelve
of the specimens which were subjected to its action for five minutes at a temperature
close to its boiling point, but it developed, on the section of the alloy with indium, a
network of either dotted or continuous lines, to which we shall again refer after we
have described the results of a general attack by aqua regia. This observation
confirms the indications afforded by polishing, and puts beyond question the
existence of a cement in the alloy of gold with indium, and this alloy has not been
submitted to the action of other reagents which attack it partially (see photo. 18).

If the alloys were kept boiling in pure hydrochloric acid for five minutes, no result
was produced, Ina preliminary trial, where the specimens had not been previously
perfectly cleaned, the rouge adhering to their surfaces was converted into ferric
