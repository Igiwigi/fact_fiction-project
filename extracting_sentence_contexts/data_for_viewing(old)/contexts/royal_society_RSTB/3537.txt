OBSERVATIONS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ORNITHORHYNCHUS. 101

of the archenteric plate of the previous stage. This was our justification for refusing
to that structure the designation of “‘ chorda-plate.” Itis only the medial strip of the
archenteric plate which properly constitutes a “chorda-plate.” The differentiation
between medial and lateral strips of the archenteric plate has previously been
emphasised (ef. e.g., figs. 56 and 57 and the series of figs. 63 et seq.). Only from the
narrow medial strip of the archenteric plate is such a definitive chorda formed as is
shown in fig. 103. The remaining lateral strips of the original archenteric plate are
converted into gastral mesoderm, as formerly described.

The marked attenuation of the definitive chorda, illustrated in fig. 103, harmonises
with the fact of its derivation from the narrow “ chorda-plate” only, 7.e., the median
strip of the original wide archenteric plate. The manner of transformation of
“chorda-plate” into definitive chorda is illustrated in the series of figs. 104-107,
Plate 3,

These figures are drawn from serial sections of the anterior region of Specimen ZZ,
which was slightly less advanced than Specimen H, but in which the process of neural
differentiation had begun (cf. figs. 73 and 74, Plate 3).

Tn fig. 104 the chorda-plate is shown as a flat cell-plate of no great width. The
section lay about 0:4 millim. behind the posterior extremity of the “ protochordal-
plate” segment in the cephalic region. Its ventral surface is still devoid of entoderm.
From this plane the chorda-plate continues backwards, showing only trifling change
