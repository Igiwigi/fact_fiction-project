Indeed, post-
core-collapse (PCC) clusters do exist, but their cores have not collapsed in such
a dramatic manner. Something must therefore eventually stop this process, most
probably the formation of binaries in the cluster cores during the late collapse
stages. In fact, the formation of a few hard binaries could entirely halt this core
collapse, even in the most massive clusters. X-ray observations, in particular, have provided circumstantial evidence for
significant binary populations in star clusters. A much higher fraction of X-ray-
bright sources in our Milky Way is associated with globular clusters than would be
expected from the field stellar population.
