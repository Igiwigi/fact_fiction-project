As a result, emissions might even increase, resulting in ‘backfire’. Druckman et al. [56],
for instance, estimate that ‘the rebound effect for a combination of three abatement actions by UK
households is approximately 34%. They also find that, ‘re-spending on goods and services with a
high GHG intensity leads to backfire.’

Second, some technologies and trends that hold out the promise of a frugal economy might
not in fact result in the projected environmental and material demand savings. For instance, while
additive manufacturing and three-dimensional printing might reduce material demand, they are
also (currently) highly energy intensive. Further, while a move to service-based economies might
result in less manufacturing-related emissions, it is well known that services also carry embodied
emissions.
