Equivalencing with
respect to Q, i.e. postcomposing by Q~!, establishes the result. a

Remark 2.7. We assume throughout this paper that C = C(t) is a bounded operator, indeed that
CeC*([0,T];32(Q;P)). In fact in every application in ยง4 we take C=O. However, in general,
C=C(t) would represent some non-homogeneous forcing in the Riccati equation satisfied by G =


G(t). Further, in Doikou et al. [34] we apply our methods here to stochastic partial differential
equations.
