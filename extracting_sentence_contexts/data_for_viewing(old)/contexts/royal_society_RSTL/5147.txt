On adding common phosphoric acid to a solution of nitrate of uranium no effect seemed to be
produced, but on examining the vessel some days afterwards, a precipitate was found to have fallen.
This precipitate proved to be sensitive in a very high degree.

L have since observed in a mineral solution a system of absorption bands 80 remarkable, and 50
closely resembling in many respects those found in the salts of peroxide of uranium, though they
occur in a totally different part of the spectrum, that I think no apology is needed for mentioning
the circumstance, The medium referred to is a 8olution of permanganate of potassa, in fact, red
Solution of mineral chameleon. In order to see the bands, it is essential to employ a dilute solution,

if anything, falls a little short of it. The second and third are the most intense of the set, I have
