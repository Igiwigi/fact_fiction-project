The interorbital septum of the rabbit may therefore be regarded, with some
degree of plausibility, as a remnant of the originally extensive septum of the reptilian
ancestor. In the Primates, the case is slightly different, for their evolution has been characterised
by a reduction in the size of the nasal capsule. The fact that Mycetes and Cebus lack
the interorbital septum might suggest that the higher Primates were descended from
forms in which the nasal capsule was larger than it now is and in which the interorbital
septum had been incorporated in the nasal septum. The presence of the interorbital |
septum in the higher Primates would then be a result of the secondary reduction in size
of the nasal capsule. But the presence of the interorbital septum in the other Platy-
rhines as well as in the Lemurs, Tarsius, and the Catarhines, makes it probable that the
