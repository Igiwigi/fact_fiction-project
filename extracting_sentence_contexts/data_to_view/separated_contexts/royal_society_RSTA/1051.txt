There are pronounced differences in the evolution and phasematching maps between the three
adjacent half-cycles caused by the build-up of free electrons from one half-cycle to the next, with
the effects of plasma lensing readily apparent in the later half-cycles. Regions of phasematching
(Ak =0) can be observed for each case, but they move to increasingly off-axis as the plasma
density increases. More importantly, the direction of phasematching changes greatly between the
three half-cycles; while the half-cycle at —3 fs has the phasematching condition satisfied on-axis
and with a low divergence, the half-cycle at —6 fs has the phasematching condition satisfied in a
strongly off-axis direction, meaning the harmonic flux contribution at the detector will be minimal
despite the fact that, locally, the ‘quality’ of the phasematching is clearly comparable between the
three cases. While phasematching being satisfied in regions away from the central axis is not
generally a problem, as the virtual source position is before the harmonic target and thus these
contributions can be re-focused to a common point [21], phasematching in the off-axis direction is
more problematic as it means the harmonic radiation cannot be recaptured and will usually have
a spread of virtual source positions. That the best on-axis phasematching occurs for the —3 fs half-cycle is in agreement with
previous full-dimensional HHG calculations [21], as is the relatively short distance (a few
hundred micrometres) over which the phasematching condition is satisfied, though quantitative
agreement is neither seen nor expected at this level of theory.
