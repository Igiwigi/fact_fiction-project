skull and the dura mater, the latter remaining intact ; later, between the dura mater
and the brain; and, finally, in the substance of the brain, and where necessary in the
eavity of the fourth ventricle.

In order to reclose a trephine hole, a steel plug of the same diameter as the trephine
was screwed tightly into it.

& Another method of raising the intra-cranial pressure was to compress the skull as a

a whole. This, naturally, was only possible in young animals. The intact skull in
3 Puppies was compressed for this purpose in various directions, and the amount
2 measured by the diminution in diameter of the skull between the points compressed.
A As a matter of fact the results thus obtained did not differ materially from those
S produced by the bag pressure, and consequently are not detailed further.

ic The effects of intra-cranial hemorrhage were employed as a means of pressure when
5 the compression by the bag had injured some vessel, which bled when the pressure
2 was removed from the bag. Also, intra-cranial vessels were intentionally divided,
2 @ and the trephine hole closed through which the division had been made.
