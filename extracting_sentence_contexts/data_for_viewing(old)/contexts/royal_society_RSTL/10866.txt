bands are seen with great distinctness, and in Hydrophilus early in 1883 I measured
the bands in wave-lengths with the following result :—

186 band . . . X618 to A 598
2nd*'band”, (NA 569.,, X 568 } Approximate.
Sr band.  . A597 ,, x 5485

The other bands could not be accurately determined. By heating this muscle in
rectified 8pirit and caustic potash I obtained a small quantity of a yellow solution
showing'some feeble shading in green, and on adding sulphide of ammonium two bands
like those of hamochromogen came into view, but much nearer violet than those of
hamochromogen, thus the first extended from about X 557 to X 548-5, and evidently
corresponded to the third band seen in the muscle. I would call attention to this fact,
becanse a similar spectrum is s8een in 8ome insect muscles without any treatment, and
it was also 8een in a 8lution of isolated myohematin from vertebrates obtained by
digesting the blood-free muscle in pepsine and water.* This kind of modified myo-
hematin was meb with in Incanus cervus, as shown in spectrum 11, Chart, IIl., also
in some 8pecimens of Periplaneta orientalis, in Bombus terrestris, and in Apis mellifica,
in all of which species the unmodified myohamatin also is found. In Lucanus
these bands of changed myohematin read :—

186 band . . . A 557 to A 548'5,
2nd band . . . N582',, A516 (?).

and therefore are placed in the same part of the aqeoienm as the third and fourth (?)
