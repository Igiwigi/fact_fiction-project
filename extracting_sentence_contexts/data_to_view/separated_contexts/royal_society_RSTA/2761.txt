After many tentative
experiments, the conviction was borne in upon us that the deviations were, in all
probability, due to corresponding variations in the amount of moisture condensed
upon the surfaces of the reaction vessels. Lanpour and others have laid great stress upon the fact that the volwmes of the
two vessels used in any given experiment were adjusted by trial until they were not
appreciably different ; any difference that might exist between the two was removed
by adding to the one possessing the smaller volume a suitable length of sealed glass
tubing. Now, if nothing more than a cursory thought is bestowed upon the matter,
it may easily be unconsciously assumed that as the two vessels are almost, though not
quite, equal in volume and very similar in form, their superficial areas are, for all
practical purposes, identical, An analysis of the actual facts may lead, as will be seen,
to a very different conclusion, We would draw attention to several very important

and interesting points. Let us consider the following three cases and the possible
attendant errors :—
