Ix a note published in the Report of the British Association for 1878 (Dublin), and
in a fuller paper in the Transactions of the London Mathematical Society, 1879
(vol. x., No. 152), I have given the forms of the eighteen, or the twenty-one (as
there explained), coordinates of a conic in space, corresponding, 80 far as corres-
pondence subsists, with the six coordinates of a straight line in space ; and in the
same papers I have establisghed the identical relations between these coordinates,
whereby the number of independent quantities is reduced to eight, as it should be.
In both cases, viz.: the straight line and the conie, the coordinates are to be obtained
by eliminating the variables in turn from the two equations representing the line
or the conic, and are in fact the coefficients of the equations resulting from the
eliminations.

In the present paper I have followed the same procedure for the case of a cubic
curve in space. Such a curve may, as is well known, be regarded as the intersection
of two quadric surfaces having a generating line in common ; and the result of the
elimination of any one of the variables from two quadric equations satisfying this
condition is of the third degree. The number of coefficients s0 arising is 4 X 10=40 ;
but T have found that these forty quantities may very conveniently be replaced by
forty-eight others, which are henceforward considered as the coordinates of the cubic
curve in space. The relation between the forty and the forty-eight coordinates is
as follows: on examining the equations resulting from the eliminations of the
variables, it turns out that they can be rationally transformed into expressions 8uch
