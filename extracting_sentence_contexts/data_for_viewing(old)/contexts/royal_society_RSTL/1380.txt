- that during the force of the late eruption the fish had totally
abandoned the coast from Portici to the Torre dell' Annun-
ziata, and that they could not take one in their nets nearer the
shore than two miles. . The divers there, who fish- for the an-
cini (which we call sea eggs) and other shell fish, likewise told
me, that for the space of a mile from that shore, since the erup-
tion, they have found all the fish dead in their shells, as they
suppose either from the heat of the sand at the bottom of the
sea, or from poisonous vapours. The divers at Naples com-
plain of their finding also many of these shell fish, or as they are
called here in general terms, frutti di mare, dead in their shells.

I thought that these little well attested facts might contri-
bute to show the great force of the wonderful chemical opera-
tion of nature that has lately been exhibited here: "The mofete,
or fixed air vapours, must certainly have been generated by the
action of the vitriolic acid upon the calcareous earth,/as. both
abound in Vesuvius. The sublimations, which are visibly ope-
rating by the chemistry of nature all along the course of the
last lava that ran from Vesuvius, and particularly in and about
the new mouths that have been formed by the late eruption
on the flanks of the volcano, having been analyzed by Signor
Domenico Tomaso, an ingenious chemist of Naples, and
whose experiments, and the result of them, are now published,
have been found to be chiefly sal ammoniac, mixed with a
