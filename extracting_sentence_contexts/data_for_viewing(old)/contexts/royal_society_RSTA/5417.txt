Normal state of the copper oxide
high-temperature superconductors

Superconductivity in the copper oxide ceramics stands as a grand challenge
problem as its solution is fundamentally rooted in the physics of strong coupling.
In such problems, traditional calculational schemes based on the properties of
single particles fail. Rather, the physics of strong coupling resides in collective
behaviour, signified typically by the emergence of new degrees of freedom at
low energy. Typifying the pivotal role played by strong correlations is the fact
that the parent state of the high-temperature copper oxide superconductors is an
insulator but the band is partially full. Other features of the normal state that
indicate a serious departure from the standard theory of metals are the presence
of a gap in the single-particle spectrum without long-range superconducting
order, the much-debated pseudogap state, and the strange metal in which the
resistivity increases as a linear function of temperature rather than the quadratic
dependence indicative of most metals.

Twenty-four years after the discovery of superconductivity in the copper
oxide ceramics (hereafter cuprates), the central problem remains the anomalous
properties of the normal state, despite extensive research on this problem. This
Theme Issue is devoted to the recent theoretical, as well as experimental, advances
