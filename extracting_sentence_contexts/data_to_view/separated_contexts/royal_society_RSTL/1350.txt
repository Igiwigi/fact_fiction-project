of the chest in breathing, speaking, and expression. 299

Upon stimulating thenerves after the death of this animal,
it was observed, that the class of respiratory nerves retained
their power of exciting their respective muscles into action,
long after the other nerves had ceased to exert any power ;
they were evidently of that class which retain their life the
longest. It is a duty to avoid the unnecessary repetition of experi-
ments, and T have now to make a $hort statement of facts,
resting on the highest authorities : experiments made without
reference to the views now presented to the Society. The division of the recurrent branch of the par vagum de-
stroys the voice.*

The division of the laryngeal branch of the par vagum stops
the consent of motion between the muscles of the glottis and
the muscles of the chest.f

The injury or compression of the par vagum produces
difficulty of breathing.7

By the assistance of these well known facts, we complete
the knowledge of the circle of actions which result from the
respiratory nerves. The medulla oblongata and spinalis are composed of columns
of nervous matter, which (from the different powers of the
nerves, as they arise from the one or other of these co-
lumns), possess distinct properties. In animals that breathe
by ribs and a numerous class of muscles, and which animals
have a spinal marrow, we see that a column of nervous
