Considerable light is shed on the precise way in which caudal migration is
accomplished by observation of the form which the intersomitic vessels assume at
each stage. Comparing the position of the duct of Cuvier at the four and a half day
stage of fig. 7 with that of the five and a half of fig. 9 we see that in the former it is

approximately opposite the fifth, and in the latter the seventh cervical ganglion.
Yet at the five and a half day stage considerable distortion of these intersomitic veins
which run into the anterior cardinal has occurred. This must mean that the region
of the anterior cardinal which is elongating originally lay in front of the level of the
cervical ganglia. Applying such criteria to the arterial system, the fact that at the
five and a half day stage those intersomitic arteries behind the twelfth interspace
are as yet undisturbed must mean that the particular section of dorsal aorta between
this level and the aortic arches must be contracting in length, leaving that caudal
to this level still in its original condition. At the seven and a half day stage
reconstructed in fig. 16, Plate 9, the most anterior intersomitic artery as yet
undisturbed is that of the eighteenth intersomitic space.

Concomitant with this shortening of the dorsal aorta behind the aortic arches,
there must take place a lengthening in front. We can decide whereabouts this
elongation principally takes place. The dorsal carotid at the level of the glosso-
pharyngeal and in front remains entirely undisturbed, as is shown by the relationship
of this nerve to the secondary external carotid root. Elongation must therefore
