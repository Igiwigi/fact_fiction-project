For reasons discussed below, no existing set of algorithms comes close to being able to simulate
the statistical properties of the variables that determine our climate (rainfall, temperature, wind
and so on) to such a level of accuracy. For some of the contemporary climate models used in
the IPCC ARS report [1], this bias-to-signal ratio can exceed a factor of 10 for some variables
and regions [2]—a hundred times bigger than what we might desire. This reflects the fact that
simulating climate accurately is an exceptionally challenging problem. We are a long way from
passing the ‘Climate Turing Test’ [3] where we cannot easily tell whether we are looking at a
simulation of climate, rather than the real thing. Hence, instead of seeking algorithms which solve the climate simulation problem to some
prescribed tolerance, we must instead ask: What algorithms can reduce systematic errors to the
smallest possible values and at the same time be not so expensive as to be unaffordable?
