ascertain what breadth of annulus might be used so that no appreciable error might
be incurred by reading the centre of the slit as the mean reading of the light passing
through it. If the slit occupied 10° of the annulus, the light passing through the
margins would be as 2051 to 1683, and the mean of these two would be 1867. The
light passing through the centre of the slit would be in reality 1858 on the same
scale. There would be, therefore, a difference between the mean of the marginal
rays and that of the mean absorption of ‘9 per cent.

If the breadth of slit occupied 5° of the annulus, the difference between the mean
of the marginal intensities and that of the actual central intensity would be ‘2 per
cent. ‘The true mean of all the rays would be less than these figures. A slit of 5°
width would, therefore, be admissible to use as giving an error much less than that
found in observations—as a matter of fact, the slit was always considerably narrower
than this, so that no appreciable error can be found on this account.

4, New Extinction Box.

In Part III. of ‘Colour Photometry ” a diagram is given of an “ extinction box,”
and also of the curves of extinction of the visible spectrum for various classes of
colour vision, For the greater part of the experiments the box was slightly altered,
so far as regards the method of admitting the light.

At the end of the box, B, an aperture was cut, which was closed by a piece of
