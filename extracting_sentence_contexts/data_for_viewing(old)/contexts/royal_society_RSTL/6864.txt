January 8, 1863, I brought forward experimental evidence which had conducted me to
view the immunity enjoyed by the stomach from being digested by its own secretion
during life, as resulting from the neutralizing influence on the acidity of the gastric
Juice exerted by the stream of alkaline blood flowing through its parietes. The oppo-
sition that this view received on the evening of its announcement induced me to extend
my experiments, and as from the additional results obtained some important confirmatory
evidence can be adduced, I have deemed it desirable to present this further communi-
cation, in which the whole subject is concisely reviewed with the aid of the new matter
that has been brought to light.

Joun HuNTER directed attention to the point under consideration in a paper entitled
<« On the Digestion of the Stomach after death,” which is contained in the Philosophical
Transactions for 1772. After adverting to the fact that in occasional instances, espe-
cially in persons who have died of sudden and violent deaths, the stomach is found 80
dissolved at its greater extremity as to have allowed of the escape of its contents into
the abdominal cavity, and, without an actual perforation occurring, that there are yery
few dead bodies in which some degree of digestion of the coats of the organ may not be
obseryed, HUNTER gives reasons for concluding that the condition described must be
owing to the action of the digestive fluid after the occurrence of death, and not the
result, of disease in the living subject. The stomach being thus affirmed to be suscept-
ible of digestion by its own secretion after death, it became necessary to account for
its not undergoing a similar process of digestion during life. According to HUNTER'S
view it was the *living principle” that afforded the required protection to. the living
organ.
