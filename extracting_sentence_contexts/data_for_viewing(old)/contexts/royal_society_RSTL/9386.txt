The slight movement in position 4, and its direction, is caused by the molecular
disturbance generated on the surface of the aluminium, where it is nearesb the glass,
being struck back in s0mewhab greater quantity than at position 3, where the interval
between the metal and glass is greater. In positions 1 and 2 the lines of force
issuing from the convex surface strike each side of the indicator equally, the opposing
face of the glass being too far off to cause a reaction.

420. Fig. 15, B, represents the position in which the mica screen, s 8, was next
placed, touching the convex side of the hemi-cylinder. The candle was at c, and the
circles represent the successive positions of the indicator. The screen has now entirely
altered the disposition of the lines of pressure. Position 3, where in the last experi-
ment the indicator was almost stationary, is now the position of greatest speed. The
indicator, in fact, has the rays which, in the absence of the screen, struck it on both
sides, now acting on one side only, and the result is a rapid rotation in the direction of
the arrows. No. 1 is the nexb best position, and then 2. The velocity and direction
of movement in these two positions are clearly due to rays of force not acting 80
strongly on the side next the screen. As the indicator is moved in the other direction,
away from the mos sensitive position 3, the influence of the screen diminishes ; at 4
the rotation is slight ; and at 5 there is no movement. In position 6 the influence of
the screen has almost disappeared, the motion now being opposite to that at No. 4.
At 7 there is another position of neutrality, and at 8 the motion is again reversed.
The movements in the last three positions correspond with those in similar positions
when the screen was absent (fig. 15, A).
