Polygonization
does not affect the final strong LPO regardless the amount of DRX. This applies to both simple
and pure shear cases (figure 11a-d and e,f, respectively). The lack of influence of polygonization
is probably due to the fact that new grains have lattice orientations close to those of their parent
grains. However, the incorporation of the polygonization process, and therefore the development
