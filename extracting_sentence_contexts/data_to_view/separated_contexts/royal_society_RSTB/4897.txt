However, at one period, between the sixth
and eleventh week, a considerable number of precocious oocytes enter upon a second
period of rapid growth, the intra-follicular growth period. All these are abnormal
and become atretic; they exhibit an extraordinary behaviour of the cytoplasmic
inclusions, especially a great development and activity of the Golgi elements. It is a remarkable and significant fact that, at one period of the ontogeny of the indivi-
dual, a number of oocytes enter upon this precocious growth period, which inevitably
results in their destruction. It is possible that, although they are never functional
in the fowl, they may be of phylogenetic significance and represent an early develop-
ment of germ-cells, which, in some more or less remote ancestor, were of functional
importance. If the primordial germ-cells fail to reach maturity in the fowl, as Firxer believes,
these precocious oocytes may be the last survivors of them, making a final abortive
attempt to form definite ova.
