The very imperfect resemblance between the two systems of lines is of course no
impeachment of the sufficiency of the theory, with corrected numerical elements, to
represent the natural phenomena in parts of the globe which observation may not
have reached. The degree of approximation to which it will do this must depend
upon the extent and correctness of the observation-basis from whence the numerical
elements are derived, and upon the order of the magnitudes comprehended in the cal-
culation. The evidence which the plate affords, that the calculations in the elaborate work
referred to differ 80 widely from the facts in the southern latitudes, shows how much
observations were wanting in those latitudes for the purpose of perfecting the theory ;
and is an ample justification (if indeed any justification were necessary) of the
exertions which the last few years have witnessed to obtain them. Since these pages were written I haye received from Mr. AxcniBaLD SMITH the fol-
lowing note.
