They excellently reproduce the functions derived from the coupled calculation,
see figure 3. On the other hand, the electronic flux density vanishes within the BO approximation,
as is discussed in ยง2c. This, however, is not true for the translational flux density and, in fact, it is
nearly identical to the numerically exact one (compare with figure 3). As an important point, this
means that an electronic flux density is accessible via a BO calculation. This fact is not restricted to
the one-dimensional case as is the construction of the electronic flux density from the continuity
equation.
