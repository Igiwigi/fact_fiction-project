Allowing for the inferior preservation of the cupule of Lagenostoma Lomasi as
compared with that of the vegetative organs of Lyginodendron, it is evident that the

glands of the one agree very closely with those of the other. In dimensions and
form, and in the structure of the stalk, there is in fact no distinction to be drawn
between them. As regards most of the specimens, however, there is this difference :
in all cupular glands observed the head is empty, or very nearly so, while in the great
majority of vegetative glands it is filled with a small-celled tissue, usually well-
preserved. So long as this difference proved constant it was impossible to regard the
two organs as identical. On searching, however, through large numbers of sections
of Lyginodendron, cases were soon met with in which the vegetative glands were in
the same condition as those on the cupule of the Lagenostoma. The first instance of
this was observed in slides 1915 B. and 1415 C. of the WiLL1AMmson Collection, cut from
the same block from which most of the specimens of the seed were derived. A small
rachis, about 2 millims. in maximum diameter, with the typical Lyginodendron
structure, appears in each of these sections; it bears glands of the usual vegetative
type, but with the head completely hollow, just as in the cupular glands.* In the
