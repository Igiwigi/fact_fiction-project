white, and more or less mixed with fine sand and grains of mica, but cannot be called
rock, though continually passing into stony masses. Lying as it does in rear of our expe-
rimental headings, it was of some value, as presenting a dead solid anvil to the pulse
from each explosion, in the contrary direction to that of the observed wave of impulse,
and hence causing a larger and more distinctly appreciable wave to be transmitted in the
direction towards the seismoscope.

The schist rock, in colour, passes from fawn-colour and light greenish ashen grey
into a rather dark tea-green. It owes its colour to disseminated thin layers of chlorite,
and probably of black or green mica in minute scales, between which are thicker layers
of quartz, presenting identically the same mineral characters as those of the quartz rock
beneath. These layers, owing to the small relative hardness and cohesion of the chlo-
rite and mica, present planes of weakness and of separation ; the rock is, in fact, every-
where thinly foliated, the average thickness of a plate seldom exceeding 02 of an inch,
and averaging about one half that thickness. These foliations are twisted, bent, doubled
up, and distorted in every conceivable way. The contortions are often large, the curyes
having radii of some feet, with minor distortions within and upon them ; but most comÂ»
monly they are small; s0 that it is rare to get even a hand specimen presenting Hat and
undistorted foliations, while, quite commonly, hand specimens may be found presenting
within a cube of 4 or 5 inches two or three curves of contrary flexure, often in all three
axes, and with curvatures short, sharp, and abrupt, almost angular. There is a general
tendency observable in the greater conyolutions to conform more or less to the surface-

contour of the country; 80 that the largest and flattest folds are found to occupy, with
an approach to horizontality, the topmost portions of the great humps or umbos of
