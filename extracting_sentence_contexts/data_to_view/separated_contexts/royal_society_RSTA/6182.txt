All of these items were analysed by multiple examiners, and the median number of examiners
evaluating each of the 117 items was 22. There was seldom agreement across examiners about
whether a particular item was inconclusive. In fact, the majority of examiners agreed an item was
inconclusive for less than 30% of the 117 items. There did not appear to be a strong relationship
between the proportion of examiners who marked an item as inconclusive and occurrence of
a false positive on the item. In total, there were 12 false positives.
