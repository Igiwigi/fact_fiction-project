30 MR. T. H. HUXLEY ON THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE CEPHALOUS MOLLUSCA.

â€”first, from the want of a clear and definite conception of the fundamental varieties
of molluscous structure, and of the nature of the changes in the relations of parts
which constitute those varieties; and secondly, from the want of a due regard to the
facts presented by the development of the different families, which must stand in the
relation of canse to the varieties of form.

Now in order to the former end (the obtaining of a definite conception of the
varieties of molluscous form), I propose to set forth the structure of certain Hetero-
poda and Pteropoda; pelagic animals s0 transparent, that a perfect knowledge of
the arrangement of their parts may be arrived at by simple inspection, without s0
much as interrupting a beat of their heart.

Afterwards, I shall inquire how far the known laws of development account
for these forms, and thence of what archetypal form they may be supposed to be
modifications.
