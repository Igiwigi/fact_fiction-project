These
errors of adjustment I found it almost impossible to avoid,
owing probably in a great measure to the magnetic centre of
the needle not being in the centre of suspension ; and it was
to counteract their effects, that I generally made obgerva-
tions on contrary sides of the centre. With respect to the direction in which the deviation due to
rotation took place, it appears, that the rotation of the plate
always caused the north end of the needle to move in the
same direction as the edge of the plate nearest the s0uth pole
of the magnetic sphere : 80 that the deviation of the north end
of the needle was in the direction in which the s0uth edge of
the plate moved, and that of the s0uth end of the needle in the
direction in which the north edge moved, referring the edges
to the poles of the sphere. Having ascertained, that when the centre of the plate was
in the pole, and its plane parallel to the equator, the deviation
due to rotation was nothing ; and some of the first experiments
which I had made having indicated that this was also the
case when the centre of the plate was in the secondary to the
equator and meridian, and its plane, as before, a tangent to
the sphere, I wished to ascertain whether such were really
the fact. The experiments, the results of which are given
in the following table, left no doubt in my mind on the sub-
ject. In making them, the instrument was adjusted, s0 that
the index at K (Fig. 1) pointed to zero, that at G to 19* go


iron arising from its rotation.
