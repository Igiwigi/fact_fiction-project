Specimens
% of the typical rocks, and of any other rocks which by reason of their exceptional
‘characters appear likely to shed light on the problem, were sent to Prof. Ernest
5 Wirson, who determined their magnetic susceptibilities. By these means it was
‘S possible to ascertain the rocks which were in any way capable of exciting the magnetic
@ disturbances, and those which were certainly incapable of causing the disturbances.
2 The results so obtained were compared with information derived from a chemical and
=. petrological examination of the most susceptible rocks, and the geological structure
£ was then considered in its bearing on the known facts. Tn the following pages, Mr. WatKkmr and Prof.
