As the ephippium becomes darker and more
matured, 80 the line dividing it from the rest of the carapace becomes more strongly
marked, and the connexion more slight, until at the time that the carapace, of which
the ephippium forms a part, is cast, the ephippium is either actually separated, or at any
rate can be detached with the greatest ease, and the carapace then looks as if a piece
bad been cut out from it. Tf the outer © saddle ”- or * pod ”- shaped ephippium is opened, another smaller, but
similar casc is found inside, enclosing the two eggs. 'This has been mentioned by all
writers on the subject, but no one, 80 far as I know, has explained the mode of origin,
or understood the true nature of it. It was also some time before I understood this question; but at length, observing one
day a specimen with a black ephippium, I remarked that it was already detached along
the lines s, s (Plate VII. fig. 6) from the rest of the carapace, 80 that" had no difficulty in
entirely removing it without, injuring the animal; and I then found, to my great surprise,
that the © inner valve,” instead of being attached to the outer one, along the back hinge,
as the descriptions of STRauss*, Miixe-EpwarpsF, and OwexÞ had led me to expect,
was actually separated from the outer valve by the new carapace, and was, in fact, in the
receptacle between the new carapace and the back. This artificial removal of the outer valves of the ephippium I repeated several times,
and always with the same result. Tf the operation is effected near the time at which the
ephippium would naturally be cast, it may be effected without in any way hurting the
Daphnia, which swims about afterwards as if nothing had happened.
