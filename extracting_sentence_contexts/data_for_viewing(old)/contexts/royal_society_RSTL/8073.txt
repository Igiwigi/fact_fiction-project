until when {=0 it coincides with the lower limit ZR.

In practice the outer end of a rather long tube-like neck cannot be said generally to
end in an infinite plane, as is supposed in the above calculation, On the contrary, there
could ordinarily be a certain flow back round the edge of tube, the effect of which must
be sensibly to diminish . It would be interesting to know the exact value of Â« for an
infinite tube projecting into unlimited space free from obstructing bodies, the thickness
of the cylindrical tube being regarded as vanishingly 8mall. Heixmonrz has solved
what may be called the corresponding problem in two dimensions ; but the difficulty in
the two cases s8eems to be of quite a different kind. Fortunately our ignorance on this
point is not of much consequence for acoustical purposes, because when the necks are
short the hypothesis of the infinite plane agrees nearly with the fact, and when the necks
are long the correction to the length is itself of subordinate importance.

Nearly Cylindrical Tubes of Revolution.

The non-rotational flow of a liquid in a tube of revolution or of electricity in a similar
solid conductor can only in a few cases be exactly determined. It may therefore be of
Service to obtain formule fixing certain limits between which the vis viva or resistance
must lie. First, considering the case of electricity (for greater simplicity of expression),
let us conceive an indefinite number of infinitely thin but at the same time perfectly
conducting planes to be introduced perpendicular to the axis. Along these the poten-
tial is necessarily constant, and it is clear that their presence must owe? the resistance
of the conductor in question. Now at the point & (axial coordinate) let the radius of
