climate, in particular the atmospheric CO, concentration.

It is hard to underestimate the anthropogenic influence on
Africaâ€™s forest cover. Humans have been setting fires and con-
trolling grazer numbers throughout their evolution, potentially
even having a major part in the spread of savanna vegetation
[52]. In general, it is thought that anthropogenic actions tended
to reduce forest cover [50,51], though there is some evidence to
the contrary [53]. Changes in the fire regime can have dramatic
and rapid effects on increasing or decreasing woody cover
[54]. There are also complex interactions at play: for example,
the recent expansion of cattle ranching leading to increased
grazing pressure can, in fact, cause woody encroachment, by
reducing grass fuel load, resulting in a decline in fire frequency
and severity, thus reducing sapling mortality and enhancing
woody encroachment [35]. Encroachment can even be enhanced
by the expansion of road networks (typically thought of as a
cause of deforestation), by creating firebreaks [55].

However, several studies suggest that global factors, in par-
ticular atmospheric CO; enrichment, are equally important [3].
An increase in atmospheric CO, reduces the advantage held
by Cy grasses over C3 trees: Cy grasses use a specialist mecha-
nism to increase the CO; concentration in cells that perform
the light reaction of photosynthesis, reducing the rate of
