The sound in the telephone is, therefore, remarkably complex. It will be noticed
that the constituents of the original note (a) have frequencies which may be written

n+p, 2n+2p,° 3n-+3p, | &e.

and these can be associated with components in (c) to give beating at frequency p. This
appears to be the explanation of the curious fact that in an experiment with a current
rich in harmonics the beating heard agrees in frequency with the galvanometer oscilla-
tions p, although with a 8.H. current the beating frequency has the double value 2p.
Examination of the above table shows that this abnormal beating at p depends essen-
tially on the co-operation of consecutive harmonics of the original current. In all cases
the ear appears to appreciate only the slowest beats which are present.

The more general case in which the interruptions are of unequal intervals and unequally
spaced may be treated in a similar way to the above. It is only necessary that the
interruptions shall be strictly periodic so that they may be represented by a Fourier
series.
