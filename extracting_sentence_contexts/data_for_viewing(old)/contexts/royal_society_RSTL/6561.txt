A verification similar to this was in fact employed at each step of the calculation of
a division : viz. in forming a product such as (AX+pY+&e.)(AX+pY+&e.), where
A, þ, &e., >, w', .. &c. are numerical coefficients, and X, Y, &c. are monomial products
of a, 6, c, d, e, f and B, C, D, F, the sum of the numerical coefficients of the product is
(2p +&.)(1+p'+&.).

It was of course necessary to employ such verifications, as a test of the correctness of
the several divisions, before proceeding to collect them together, but the collection itself
affords an exceedingly good ultimate verification. The following is an exemplification :
the terms in y which involve the product BCDE are obtained by the collection of the
corresponding terms in the ten divisions, as follows:
