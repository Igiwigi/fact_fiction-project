polarization due to the applied field and s is the coefficient of the corrective
polarization—the effect of the replaced molecules.

Within a crystalline structure, however, this method of averages applied to the
molecules within the cavity is not valid, for each molecule is orientated so as to occupy
some definite position with respect to its neighbours. In such a case the local force,
due to a molecule which is close to the point under consideration, is uncompensated,
and we have to resort to indirect deduction from experimental facts to obtain a
measure of the polarization effect due to the molecules immediately surrounding the
point. It is to this uncompensated effect that we have attributed the rigidity of the
crystalline medium.* In order to avoid the complexity introduced by the elasticity
of crystalline media Larmor confined his investigations to fluids; but, as we are
attempting to ascribe to these very elastic forces a nature which permits of their
interpretation in terms of a local molecular field binding the molecules together, the
treatment for crystalline substances is the same in kind as that for fluid substances.

The rigidity of gels at low temperatures is of a different nature and is probably
due to an interlocking of the molecules (arranged at random) whose thermal agitation
is sufficiently reduced. ‘This is in accordance with the work of Tammannt who found
that at very low temperatures the power and velocity of crystallization were very
