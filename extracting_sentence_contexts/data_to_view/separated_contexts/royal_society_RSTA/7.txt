The system of currents is stationary in space, but is displaced relatively to the Sell

* This represents a fictitious distribution of currents

which would give at all points of the disk the
same normal force as the actual field. PROFESSOR H. LAMB ON ELLIPSOIDAL CURRENT-SHEETS, 159

The most important type of induced currents is got by putting n = 2, s = 1, in (95). In this case
Dc a,
so that the lines of force at the disk are normal to it, but the direction of the force is
reversed as we cross the axis of y.
