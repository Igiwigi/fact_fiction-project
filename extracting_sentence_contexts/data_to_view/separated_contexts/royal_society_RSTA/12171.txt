e mines of Carniola.t The hills around Kropp, which rise to the height of several
hundred metres above the sea level, are traversed by large fissures filled with a
reccia, with which is associated a hydrated oxide of iron in grains from the size of
@ pea to that of a nut. This breccia contains, as usual, angular fragments and large
blocks of the adjacent limestone rocks. The greater number of these fissures are
Unfossiliferous, but in a few the teeth and bones of Ursus spelwus have been discovered,
and in one the tooth of a carnivorous animal was found at a depth of about 250 feet.
