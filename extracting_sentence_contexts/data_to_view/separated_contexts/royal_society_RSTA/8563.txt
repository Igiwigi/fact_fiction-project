The dispersion-constants selected for these calculations were
AP = 0-038, \.? = 0-06, but since the sum of these two constants 0-098 is almost
identical with the sum of the constants 0-030+-0-074 — 0-104 used in the case of
tartaric acid, there can be little doubt that the latter pair would have given equally
satisfactory results. The negative rotation-constants, k,, as set out in Table XIII, are larger than might
have been expected, approaching almost to one-half of the values for the positive rotation-
constant k,. This is due to the fact that the dispersion-constant A,° of the negative
term is but little greater than the dispersion-constant ,? of the positive term; the

negative term must therefore be weighted somewhat heavily to produce any marked
alteration in the form of the curve.
