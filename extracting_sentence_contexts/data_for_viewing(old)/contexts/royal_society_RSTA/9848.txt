The question naturally arises whether there is any appreciable interchange of air
between the isothermal region and the strata below it. The diffusion over the whole
earth of the dust thrown up into the very highest strata by the Krakatoa eruption in
1883 proves that the air at these levels circulates between the equator and the poles,
and if, as we have good reason to think, the air above 16 km. is much colder over the
equator than over Europe we should expect this circulation. It is certain, too, that
the trades and anti-trades above them do not form a closed system confined to the
region between 35° S. and 35° N. This may be proved as follows. The sum total of
the angular momentum of the earth’s atmosphere about the axis of rotation remains
approximately constant from year to year, and hence the moment of the couple acting
upon the atmosphere is on the average zero. The only forces that form this couple
are forces due to friction at the earth’s surface, for the mutual reactions of the
atmosphere as a whole cannot alter the angular momentum. From the fact that a
persistent wind produces a powerful ocean current we know that the frictional force
between the atmosphere and the earth must be considerable. Such a force is
persistently exerted in the region of the trades over nearly half the earth’s surface,
and is constantly acting so as to give an easterly directed momentum to the
atmosphere. It is balanced, as Ferret pointed out, by the westerly directed
component produced by the friction of westerly winds in temperate latitudes. This
requires an interchange of angular momentum between the tropics and temperate
latitudes, and this can hardly occur in any way save by the interchange of masses of
air which must have both a N.-S. and an E.—W. component. Hence at some level
across parts of the boundary either N.E. and 8. W. or N.W. and 8.E. winds must blow.
