ON THE EARLY STAGES OF INFLAMMATION, 681

; an hour or more: als its effects appeared inconsistent with my theory ; for while
tn 14 ultimately gave rise to diffusion of the pigment to even a greater extent than T
had seen occur with mustard, yet it induced only comparatively slight appearances of
eongestion. Chloroform also seemed at first still more anomalous in its operation,
though in the opposite way; for though it was pre-eminently potent in inducing con-
gestion, it caused no alteration whatever in the appearance of the pigment, whether
mildly or strongly applied. — Afterwards, as the true nature of the pigmentary functions became unveiled, and
Further facts were developed, these difficulties were completely cleared away, The first
step towards their solution was made in an experiment with ammonia. A. frog being
< Placed under chloroform, I covered the whole of the foot with sweet oil, except a small
S area in one of the webs, the pigment being in the stellate condition, 7. e. about midway
Z between perfect concentration and full diffusion. An assistant then held at a short
= distance above it a piece of lint soaked- in the strongest liquor ammonite, 80 that its
pungent alkaline vapour might play upon the exposed area, while the rest of the foot
<= was protected by the oil.
