activations following the reward itself decreased
monotonically with increasing probability, and the
depressions with reward omission increased with
probability, thus reflecting quantitative relationships
of the known reward prediction error coding (Schultz
et al. 1997). These dopamine signals apparently encode
the value of rewards as defined by reward probabilities.

At least one-third of dopamine neurons showed an
additional, separate, slower and more sustained
activation during the interval between the stimulus
and the reward which tended to increase as the interval highest at p=0.5 and decreased towards lower and
elapsed. The signal was the highest at p=0.5 and lower higher probabilities (figure 1). Rewards were fictive
at lower and higher probabilities (figure 2). Owing to money units. Functional magnetic resonance imaging
