This will diminish the effect of the edge in comparison with the total effect, but in rare-
fied air both the mutual action and the effect of the edge are much increased. In his
claro. however, the effect of the three edges of the disks is s8upposed to be the
same, whether they are in contact or separated. This, I think, will account for the large |
value which he has obtained for the viscosity, and for the fact that with the brass disks
which vibrate in 14 seconds, he finds the apparent viscosity diminish as the pressure dimi-
nishes, while with the glass disks which vibrate in 8 seconds it first increases and then
diminishes. M. Merer concludes that the viscosity varies much less than the pressure, and that it/
increases slightly with increase of temperature.
