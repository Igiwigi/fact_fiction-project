every three or four days. His records extend from May 1940 to July 1942. In the original
paper (Hepburn 19434, p. 18) a graph illustrates the catch per trap per day over the period
mentioned.

The data of de Vries are from exposures of one carcass per month throughout the period
1941 to 1943 ahd give the total of the adult flies which were reared by him from the carcasses.
They provide a rough index of the populations actually breeding on carrion during each
month of the year, as distinct from the adult fly population which is present. A rough
comparison can be made between these records and the data of Smit. Although the records
of the two observers were taken during different years (although at the same place), it may
be presumed that the general trend of population abundance for each species of fly will not
differ so markedly from season to season as to invalidate such a comparison if the whole of
the two-year records are used in each case. This presumption is justified by the fact that, in
both cases, the periods of abundance coincide during both years for all species.

2. Inherent deficiencies in the available records

In several respects, the field records available for the Karroo and other areas lack
essential information. To provide data for the basis of a detailed discussion of field popula-
tions and their relationship to the available carrion, more intensive field work will be
necessary. Some deficiencies in the records at hand will be dealt with briefly at this point.

The records of Smit (1945) were made by exposing one baited trap per month. Carrion
remains attractive to any given species of fly for a limited period. After this, the particular
species concerned is no longer interested in it as a medium for oviposition and therefore does
