known to be living free were thought to possess tailless development, among
species that were attached to some solid substratum both tailless and tailed larvee
occurred.

The only other theory put forward was that of Harrmeyer (1911), who suggested
that the anural type of development could be correlated with the presence of viviparity ;
this was based on the facts that the viviparous species, Molgula bleizi, had been stated
to possess this type of development, and that statements made concerning the remaining
species known to have anural development left the question open. It was known,
however, that certain species of Molgua that were viviparous produced tailed larvee,
so that this theory has held but little weight.

Since these early descriptions no new evidence has been brought forward until very
recently, but now the development is known for about twenty members of the Molgu-
lide and they will be described in turn before further discussion is made. First, of
those species the development of which was described by Lacaze-Dututurs the following
have been re-examined :â€”Molgula bleizi, M. echinosiphonica (citrina), M. roscovita
(occulta), M. oculata, M. ampulloides, M. simplex, and M. lanceplaini (complanata),
leaving to be confirmed the development of Molgula solenota, and the Molgula
