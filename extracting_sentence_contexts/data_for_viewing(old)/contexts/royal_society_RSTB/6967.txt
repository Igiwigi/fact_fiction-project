incursion of the fen clay, so that the boundary between VII d and VII lies at 155 cm.,
and that between VIIc and VII at 430 cm., VIIa and VIIé are not separable. It
will be noted that the fen clay produces extremely large effects on the course of the
diagrams. Zones VIIa, 6, and VIId are dominated by Alnus which was doubtless
growing in local fen woods, but in zone VII¢ the Alnus falls, and all the pollen curves
of trees from the upland show corresponding high values. This rise affects Quercus,
Ulmus, Tilia, Pinus, and perhaps Corylus.

It is difficult in this diagram to say where the boundary should be set between
zones VII and VII-VIII, but at 75 cm. it will be seen that Betula begins to rise, Ulmus
exceeds Tilia, Fagus increases in amount, and there is some suggestion of a Pinus
maximum. The probability that this is the onset of zone VII-VIII is supported by the
fact that the peat there shows a change to a drier character.

A clear view of the stratigraphy of the peat beds at this site emerges from an examina-
tion by Dr M. H. Clifford of plant remains in the coarse residue of our peat digests.
He reports as follows: ‘‘’ The Upper Peat appears throughout to be aquatic in character,
with fresh-water shells from 155 to 80 cm. and Cladium mariscus from 130 to 60 cm., both
constantly represented, together with smaller amounts of Scirpus and oospores of the

Characeae. At the 40cm. level fern sporangia become abundant, together with
cyperaceous rootlets and woody material: these may well indicate the beginning of a
drier stage of growth of fen woods or carr.
