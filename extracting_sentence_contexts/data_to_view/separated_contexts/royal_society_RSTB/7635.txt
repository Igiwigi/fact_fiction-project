Allen. The results given below
are expressed in the usual way as the Sr/Ca ratio. In calculating the ratio, the small Mg
content of the rocks has been neglected and the soluble fraction taken as CaCO,:

Sr/1000Ca Sr/1000Ca
laminated limestone, Dorset 0-38 normal marl, Dorset 2-00
laminated limestone, Dorset 0:38 normal marl, Dorset 2-00
normal limestone, Dorset 0-38 normal marl, Glamorgan 2-00
normal limestone, Dorset 0-80 Sutton Stone, Glamorgan 0:38
normal limestone, Glamorgan 0-38 primary calcite, Dorset 0-80

The most interesting feature of the results is the consistently higher Sr content of the
marls, a fact for which no satisfactory explanation can be offered. Many more results of
this type are needed to confirm whether this is a normal feature. The Sr/1000Ca ratios of
the limestones are consistently close to the average (0-71) determined for a large number
of limestones of different ages by Kulp, Turekian & Boyd (1952), and are similar to that
determined for a specimen of calcite from a drusy cavity in one of the Blue Lias lime-
stones.
