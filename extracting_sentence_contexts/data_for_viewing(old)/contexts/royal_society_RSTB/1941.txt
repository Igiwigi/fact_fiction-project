which is stated to arise in the pre-frontal lobe and pass downwards as far as the
pons Varolii.

The experiments wereâ€”

1. Extirpation of the pre-frontal lobe (Exps. 26, 27, 28).
2, Extirpation of the frontal lobe anterior to the pre-central sulcus, and its
prolongation upwards to the superior longitudinal fissure (Exps. 29, 30).

1. The posterior boundary of the pre-frontal lobe was determined in each case by
electrical stimulation, and the non-excitable portion of this lobe only removed.

Our recent researches have not added anything to the facts already known in
connexion with the functions of this area.

2. In a case in which both frontal lobes were removed in front of the pre-central
sulcus, certain phenomena were observed which had not been previously noted in
experiments upon this region.

The frontal lobes were removed in two operations, the first consisting of extir-
pation of the left lobe. On the cut surface of the brain were seen the nucleus
caudatus and the anterior part of the internal capsule, but the lateral ventricle was
itself not opened.

The operation was followed by deviation of both eyes to the left, and there was
