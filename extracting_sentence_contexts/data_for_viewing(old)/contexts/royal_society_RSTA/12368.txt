stations except Toronto, Batavia, and Melbourne. At Utrecht, the disturbance in
V.F. nearly resembles the disturbance in declination, and is much greater apparently
than the V.F. disturbances at Wilhelmshaven, or at any other observatory in
the north-west of Europe. Unfortunately, the photographic paper on which the
traces are taken is too narrow, and so the H.F. trace passes off the paper during the

great magnetic disturbances, but there is a great resemblance between the traces
given by the three Utrecht instruments. This resemblance is due to the fact that the
horizontal and vertical force changes are given by means of deflecting magnets and
iron induction bars according to Lamont’s plan ; hence, the horizontal and vertical
foree needles are affected by changes in declination, and the vertical force trace is also
affected by changes in horizontal force.

Thus the change in horizontal force in metric units

8X = 000376 (p, — p),

where p, and p are the changes in ordinates of horizontal force and declination
expressed in millimetres.
If 8Z be the increase of vertical force, and p, the change in the ordinate of the
