Problem (1) was formulated by me as an open challenge to the participants of the conference fo
Quantum Probability and Noncommutative Geometry (August 2000, Nottingham Trent University). a]
The first results in this direction confirm the existence of such data [27,28]. Problem (2) is more DN
difficult and to my knowledge open at the moment, but active research in this direction is 1B
currently being developed mainly by A. Khrennikov and his group. [8

(d) Probability, information and measurements

The fact that any probability is a conditional probability has been emphasized by many
authors (e.g. [29]): it is conditioned on the information available at a given moment. Thus the
object of probability theory is to optimally use available information at a given moment to
make predictions on the future in conditions of incertitude. Usually the available information
is considered fixed and omitted from the notation.
