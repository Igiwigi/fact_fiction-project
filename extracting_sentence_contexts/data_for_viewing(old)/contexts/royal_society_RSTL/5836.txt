pound matrix is obtained by combining the corresponding line of the first or further
component matrix successively with the several columns of the second or nearer com-
pound matrix.

12. A matrix compounded, either as first or second component matrix, with the matrix
zero, gives the matrix zero. The case where any of the terms of the given matrix are

Q infinite is of course excluded.
J 13. A matrix is not altered by its composition, either as first or second component

5 matrix, with the matrix unity. It is compounded either as first or second component
= matrix, with the single quantity mz considered as involving the matrix unity, by multi-
= plication of all its terms by the quantity mz: this is in fact the before-mentioned rule
= for the multiplication of a matrix by a single quantity, which rule is thus seen to be a

3 particular case of that for the multiplication of two matrices.
= 14. We may in like manner multiply or compound together three or more matrices :

= the order of arrangement of the factors is of course material, and we may distinguish
E them as the first or furthest, second, third, &c., and last or nearest component matrices.
S but any two consecutive factors may be compounded together and replaced by a single
S matrix, and $0 on until all the matrices are compounded together, the result being inde-
S pendent of the particular mode in which the composition is effected; that is, we have
EZ L.MN=TIM.N=LMN, LM.NP=L.MN.P, &ec., or the operation of multiplication,
