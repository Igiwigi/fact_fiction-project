Ficure 21. Westhay trackway: the trackway cut across transversely in the profile of the peat face.
Note the Cladium peat layer showing the maximum of the first swamping and the Scheuchzeria peat of
the later swamping.

The trackway was about 6 ft. (2 m.) in width and the basis of its construction was stems
of birch from } in. (1-2cm.) to 6in. (15 cm.) in diameter (figure 22). These were laid
longitudinally and transverse pieces were rare and not large. The smaller stems tended to
be less strictly longitudinal than the larger, but all were natural cylindrical stems with
bark quite intact and only the lateral branches trimmed off. It was evident that brush-
wood had been laid between these timbers, and Calluna and Myrica twigs were recognizable
in the 6 in. (15 cm.) layer of ‘brush’ over and between the main stems. It was evident
that there had been considerable superposition of timbers, and from the fact that more
stems were present on the west side of the track it seemed possible that the track might
have been formed in two stages, the big timbers of the later stage having been put slightly
to one side. This view was supported by the discovery that when one of these large upper

timbers was removed there was found beneath it the top of a small sharpened vertical
stake, that could only have been inserted before the big stem was laid.

Sharpened vertical stakes of this kind, about 1 in. (2-5 cm.) in diameter, were driven
downwards at intervals between the main timbers and doubtless served to pin the loose
