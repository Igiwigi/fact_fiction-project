C22 ace 5 4¢- 26.) (10-2)

This equation does not at first sight appear to be in accord with equation (9-4). However,
it will be shown that equation (9-4) does in fact reduce to equation (10-2) when the strains
are small. It is seen in §9 that equation (9-4) is equivalent to equation (9-3). Writing A, = 1+¢),
Ay = 1+ €y, Ag = 1-+e3, where e,, e, and e, are the principal extensions for a small strain,
we have

W = GE[2(e, +6 +6s) + (+2 +65)?
