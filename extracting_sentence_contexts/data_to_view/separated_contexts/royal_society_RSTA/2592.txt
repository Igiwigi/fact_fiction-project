The volcano underwent almost 1m of uplift right after the end of the 2011-2012 eruption
in three discrete pulses during 2012-2018 (figure 4a), ongoing as of May 2018, and with very
similar spatial footprints [61]. This post-eruptive inflation is not associated with abnormal
seismicity [51] or temperature change (figure 4b). The fact that the ground deformation followed
an exponential trend during the first three years after the eruption [51], as predicted by the magma
injection models (ยง2b), strongly suggests that the post-eruptive deformation is of magmatic
origin. Finite-element simulations show that viscoelastic relaxation is of secondary importance
with respect to magma injection [61]. Alternatively, inflation after eruption is possible with
no recharge for an incompressible magma [58].
