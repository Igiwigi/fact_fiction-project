related propositional classes, we consider a system 8 of 22” clagses, viz., that derived
from the 2" unrestricted classes , b, c, d,...; the classes 7 and mT being other classes
of 8. If as is generally the case T is regarded as derived from 1 unrestricted classes,
represented by single letters A, B, C, D,... , the number of classes in T will be

2
2”, in Þ will be 2”, in S will be 2 .

375. In a syllogizm we have two classes called the premisses, e.g., (1) (ab=a),
(2) (be=b). We consider the class which is the product of these, viz.,
(ab=a) (be=b), 1.e., that which contains all the separated classes of T, which both
(1) and (2) do. This class includes some classes, is included in others, &c. TI is
included in (ac=a). The syllogizm indicates this fact, the clags (4c=a) being
called the concluston.

376. We have then under discussion in an investigation of classes a system of
