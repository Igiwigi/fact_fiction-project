The colour of this variety is due to two distinct pigmentations. The brown com-
ponent is precisely the same as that of the simple brown. The hue is the same and it is

confined to the ectoderm in the same way. The apparent difference in tone of the
animal seen as a whole is due to the existence in the endoderm of dark granules of
melanin up to 1 w across. Highly magnified, the larger granules appear black and the
smaller ones various shades of brown (figure 3). In the column region these granules
alter the tone due to the overlying ectodermal brown to a dusky hue. In the capitu-
lum and tentacles, the relative absence of brown and the intensity of melanic de-
position gives the grey and black appearance. This variety corresponds in fact to the
superposition of two varieties, a simple brown and a simple grey described next.

Ficure 3. Transverse section of wall of brown with grey Metridium showing base of a mesentery
(right). Ectoderm contains nematocysts and diffuse brown pigment represented by stippling.
Endoderm contains black granular melanin especially at base of mesentery. Bar = 100 p.

(5) Simple grey. This form is rarely well developed, but is fairly often seen in ‘dirty
whites’. In contraction it resembles a white except for a greenish grey hue. When
expanded, however, it is seen that there is a diffuse distribution of grey pigment within
the animal, rising in intensity in the capitulum to near the bases of the tentacles. The
disk is pale grey. The stomodaeum is usually pale brownish grey with dead white
siphonoglyph. The grey is due to melanin granules in the endoderm. The whole
