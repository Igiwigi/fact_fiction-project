At first sight this does
not appear to be a very feasible undertaking. Indeed, because of the large number of
rolled leaves and leaf primordia in the terminal bud and the dense investment of scales,
the apices of ferns have not generally commended themselves as providing favourable
materials for experimental investigations. Nevertheless, it is a fact of experience that there
is little difficulty in removing the scales and leaf primordia from stout shoots of D. aristata
or D. filix-mas and thereby laying bare the apical cone. These operations are carried out
by means of small pointed scalpels and forceps, the material being observed under a binocular
* microscope (Wardlaw 19446). A downward view of the apical cone and of the associated
leaf primordia is illustrated diagrammatically in figure 1.
