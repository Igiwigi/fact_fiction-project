Nevertheless, many real-life processes (e.g. sonar, radar, biomedical and

economic) do not fall into the Gaussian and/or linear assumption. Moreover, the existence of [=
non-stationarity alters the statistical characteristics of the process with time, posing an additional : S
factor to be considered in signal analysis. In fact, in most natural systems, the properties of 1s
interacting oscillatory systems are not constant, as there is an evolution or fluctuation in time, : =
altering the mutual interaction among subsystems, their frequencies and amplitudes. In addition, 3
the temporary occurrence of frequency and phase coupling, with varying strengths, exposes iB
time-dependent nonlinear interactions between a pair of individual oscillators. : =
It is apparent, therefore, that, in a time-series setting, nonlinearity, non-Gaussianity and : R
non-stationarity cannot be attained solely via the examination of the spectrum. Identification : o
of nonlinearities in the process, however, could provide an alternative feature space that : >
enhances further their value in the examined problem.
