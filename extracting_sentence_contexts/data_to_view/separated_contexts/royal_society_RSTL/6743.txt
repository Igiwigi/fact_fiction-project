The reason for making the above deduction will be fully explained in our paper © On
Q the Influence of Temperature on the Flectric Conducting-power of Alloys.” One glance,
NA however, will show that the deduced values agree as well together as can be expected,
5 considering that the results may be modified by the presence of carbon, snIphur, &c.
Z In cases where we may assume that we have only solutions of one metal in another, the
5 concordance in the deduced yalues is very great; in fact, when we experiment with
DP metals whose conducting-power in a pure state is known, and when the impurity 1s
Sonly dissolved in it, then the deduced conducting-power agrees almost exactly with
= that found experimentally. = For resistance-thermometers, as described by S1eEMENS®, the use of an iron wire would
give much greater differences for the same increment of temperature than copper; for
© the resistance of pure copper wire increases for each degree about 0:4 per cent., whereas
3 that of pure iron increases about 0-6 per cent. for each degree.
