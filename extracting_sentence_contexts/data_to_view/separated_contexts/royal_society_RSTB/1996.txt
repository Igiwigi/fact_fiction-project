The crossed larve, though
fewer in number, thus appear to be more hardy and capable of surviving. In caleu-
lating these mean numbers, the percentage of pure brown-white larve surviving to
thirty days was not included, as the corresponding determinations with the dissimilar
colour variety larvae were not made. This was due to the fact that all of the small
number of larvee surviving till twenty-four days were then needed for enumeration. HYBRID AND PARENT FORMS OF ECHINOID LARVA. 515

As in the previous instance, these numbers fail to show that the brown-white varieties
are less fertile with the white varieties than are the white-brown ones; but as the
differences of fertility are in any case so. small, one would scarcely expect this |
graduated relationship to show itself. When crossed with Strongylocentrotus sperm,
the ova of the white-spined Spherechinus were the only ones to yield a fair proportion |
of blastulze and larve, The percentages of plutei given in the eight to eighteen days
column of the table are for eight days only in the case of these hybrids.
