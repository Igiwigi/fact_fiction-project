it is related to the global rate matrix via LDB.

Let N* be some unit structure with height less than three representing the original system,
without the feedback apparatus. Using equation (4.1), the EP without the feedback apparatus is
lower-bounded by

oN > By = TN (ph (X)) — DN" (p70). 6.3)

By coupling that original system to the feedback apparatus we construct a new system, M, which
comprises the original system together with an extra subsystem (the feedback apparatus) and
new dependencies of the original coordinates of the system on the state of that new subsystem.
There are many possible unit structures, M*, over this new joint system-feedback-apparatus. For
simplicity, exploit the fact that C evolves independently of the other coordinates in the system
(by not evolving at all) to construct M* directly from \V*, by replacing each unit » €.V* with
a new unit, w'(w):=@ UC. So M* and N* contain the same number of units, with each unit in
M* containing the subsystem C, and X,.(4) =C x Xw. (It does not matter if we add an additional
unit to M*, containing just C itself.) This gives a new lower bound on the EP, B,y-. In electronic
supplementary material, appendix J, it is shown that the difference between the lower bound
on EP in the new, feedback scenario and the lower bound on EP in the original, no-feedback


scenario, is _
Bu — Byxw= A [eyelet | — AI(Xy;C). (5.4)

By conservation of energy, the work done on the system during [f;,t] is the change in its
