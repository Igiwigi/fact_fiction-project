Mohammed et al. [53] prepared a binary composite of MnO>/faidherbia albida fruit shell-derived
carbon (MnO2/FAFSC) using a hydrothermal route. The assembled cell was investigated using


MnO 2/FAFSC as a positive electrode and faidherbia albida fruit shell-derived AC sphere (FAFSC)
as the negative electrode. The full cell showed a specific energy of 32Whkg~! and a specific
power of 400 W kg~! in PVA-KOH gel electrolyte at 8mA cm~? within a working potential range
of greater than 1.6 V [53]. The utilization of faidherbia albida fruit shell (biomass) as a carbon
source made the synthesis approach (green synthesis) environmentally friendly and sustainable.

Recently, green synthesis of composite materials has received immense attention in the area
of science and technology, particularly in the design of energy storage system due to the
fact that they are environmentally benign, commercially feasible and low-cost [43]. Different
composite materials such as bacterial cellulose (BC) /MnOp [54], wheat flour (WF) /PANI [55] and
iron complex/egg yolk [56] have been synthesized using a green synthesis approach. In green
synthesis, biomasses as renewable sources have been adopted as a template or precursors for the
composite preparation. As such, the biomass-derived carbon composites reveal the enhancement
of the specific capacity, specific energy, specific power and cycle life [48]. Among the biomass
sources, the dark red hibiscus sabdariffa (R2HS) dry calyces belonging to the Roselle (hibiscus
sabdariffa) family is cultivated in the tropical and subtropical countries [57,58]. This type of
category of hibiscus sabdariffa (HS) also called organic acid has been demonstrated to contain
a high amount of anthocyanins, phenolic and antioxidant [59]. The composition of R2HS is a
tremendous source to deliver carbon that can be integrated into a transition metal oxide matrix to
generate an eco-friendly and low-cost composite electrodes materials [60]. In our previous work,
different vanadium pentoxide carbon composites (V2O5@C-WHS, V205@C-R1HS and V2Os@C-â€”
