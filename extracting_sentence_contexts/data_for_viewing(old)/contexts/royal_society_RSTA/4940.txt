in which the first factor vanishes (again because n is odd). a

In fact, we have the following explanation of this vanishing.

Lemma 7.2. The cohomology groups HAZ [1/A], F) all vanish.

Proof. The idea is simply to imitate, cohomologically, the argument given above.
We first define a sheaf F on all of A? which agrees with our previously defined F on A2[1/A]
and whose trace function at any point (a,b) € A?(Ey) is

(-=) Ye x28, (x" + ax +b).
