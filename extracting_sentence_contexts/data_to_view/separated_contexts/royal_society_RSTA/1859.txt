In the present experiments the determination of the frequencies of the components
has been effected with all the accuracy desired, but as it has not yet been found possible
to avoid selective action due to resonance of diaphragms, the amplitudes of the com-
ponents are not faithfully represented. No attempt has been made to deduce the
absolute amplitudes of motion of the original vibration. When the components of a vibration have strictly commensurable frequencies, as
in a harmonic series, the phase relations of the components are quite definite, and the
determination of the relative phases might be of valueâ€”in fact it would be necessary

if it were required to reconstruct the wave-form of the vibration. It would not be
difficult to adapt the method of analysis by interruption for the determination of phase-
difference, but no experiments in this direction have yet been made.
