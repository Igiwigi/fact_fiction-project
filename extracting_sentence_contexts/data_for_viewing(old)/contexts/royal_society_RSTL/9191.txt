'= the objector may ask, Why not suppose that the stimulus is conveyed to the polypite by some other tissue-element

altogether, e. g. by zz, and hence that the function of the radial elements & @ is exclusively that of enabling the
polypite to localize correctly ? Against this objection, of course, nothing can be urged, except that it merely
suggests a possibility, and this a very improbable one. If snch additional tissue-tracts are present, they must;
rezemble those treated of in the text in at least one distinetive feature, viz. in having the property of conveying
impressions to a distance. And forasmuch as the only objection to the above hypothesis consists in its 8uppos-
ing the distinguishing property of nerve to be blended with the property of vicarious action in a high degree, I
cannot perceive any adyantage in again supposing these properties blended in another tissue-element. On the
contrary, any 8uch additional supposition appears to me quite unnecessary, and, if accepted, would certainly
8erye but to render the explanation offered in the text more complicated than it is. Moreover the fact already
alluded to in the text—viz. that tentative moyements differ in no respect from the accurately localizing move-
ments, except in their want of precision—this fact, I think, strongly tends to show that the same kind of
þ tissue-clements is concerned in the production of all these moyements.

of unsevered tissue on either side of that tube. The fact of its doing 80, however,
certainly seems to be connected with the fact of the radial tubes being tracts of high
excitability. Now the latter fact, it seems to me, can only be accounted for in one of two
ways, Either (4) we must swppose the course of a radial tube to coincide with that of -
a chain of ganglionic elements, or else (5) we must snppose it to coincide with something
