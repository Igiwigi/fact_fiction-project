There is no theory for a complex wave pattern,
but it is expected that the theory discussed above will give at any rate the order of magnitude
of the higher harmonics of each constituent wave train. R< In fact

APPENDIX 2. FREQUENCY ANALYSIS OF PRESSURE RECORDS

Introduction

We have seen that the velocity potential of swell may be described as the sum of a num-
ber of sine-wave potentials whose frequencies lie in well-defined and slowly varying ranges. The length of the records can be adjusted so that during any one record the frequency band
from each generating area remains roughly constant.
