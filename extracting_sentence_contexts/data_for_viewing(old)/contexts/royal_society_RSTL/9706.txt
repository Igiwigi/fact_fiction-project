folution and in MiLrer's fluid (according to the method recommended by Zriss for
floating out the tubes), but have obtained no appearances that might not be produced
by the much-branched vesicles just described in the thyroid glands of young Dogs. In
fact, there can be no doubt that these are the game structures as those which Zeiss

obtained by flotation. Our observations also agree, inasmuch as Zpss observed these
tubes in the glands of young animals : at leas6 he makes no statement to the effect
that they have been found in the glands of adult animals. From the fact of their
complete, or almost entire, absence in the glands of adult Dogs, T regard these mnch-
branched vesicles merely as forming a stage in the growth of the organ, and consider
that in its fully developed state the gland-vesicles form cavities more or less spherical
in shape, which are very rarely, if at all, branched, or, in other words, in com-
munication with one another. The presence of branched vesicles in a gland probably
indicates that the number of vesicles is being increased by the growth into the vesicles
already present of involutions of their walls, together with processes of the inter-
vesicular tissxue. PEREMESCHKO (loc. cit.) figures this division of the gland vesicles
both in the embryo and adult Rabbit. He considers it probable that the division of
vesicles takes place after intra-uterine life. W. MVTLER is also of opinion, from an
examination of the gland at different ages in Man, that completely-formed follicles
(vesicles) undergo segmentation by the growth into them of processes of the mesoblast.
