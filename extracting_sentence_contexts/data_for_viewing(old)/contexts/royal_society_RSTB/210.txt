358 MR. F. GOTCH ON THE ELECTROMOTIVE PROPERTIES

The preparations used in these temperature experiments were made from -

excitation. The activity of the fish has great influence on the result. Occas
obtained from sluggish fish a nerve organ response with a very slight, barely percepti
secondary effect, only revealed by close rheotome analysis. This was not due to:
fact that the primary response was of less intensity, but was evidently depend
upon the diminished excitability of the tissue ; since in excitable tissue obtained fr
vigorous fish a well-marked secondary response occurred following minimal excitat
of the nerve. The following experiment shows a maximal and a minimal effect :
maximal effect has four apices :—

ExpertMeEnt 10.—Torpedo 46 x 31 centims. Nerve organ preparation 48 x 10 x
millims. Nerve excited 40 millims. from point of entry. 3 Groves in primary,

Maximal effect. Galv. +35. Secondary coil 7000.
