is best observed when gas has been led through the apparatus until the traces of gaseous
admixture (only to be estimated as millionths of the whole mass) have become 80 small
that their absence would not diminish the resistance to combination of the induced
gas. In order to establish this fact we have made many experiments, one of which we
subjoin ; the insolation-yessel contained only about 3 cub. cent. of gas, and many litres
of the chlorine and hydrogen mixture had passed for two days through the apparatus,
The first horizontal division of the following Table contains the number of the experi-
ments according to the order in which they were made; the 8econd division contains the
times during which the newly-evolved gases stood in the dark previous to insolation ;
and the third division gives the length of time which the gas was led through the instru-
ment, between each set of observations. The numbers in the corresponding vertical
columns represent the photo-chemical action for the times found in the first vertical
column.
