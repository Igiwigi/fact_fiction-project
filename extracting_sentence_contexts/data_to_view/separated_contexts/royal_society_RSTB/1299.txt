3 Amia: exquisitely dispondylous in the tail.

& Elasmobranchs : mostly dispondylous in the tail.

% (Scymnus is monospondylous.)

4 Higher vertebrates.—Monospondylous [because they are arco-centrous].

§ While Kérzicer, in speaking of Heptanchus, obviously meant by “ Wirbel” only
eir centra or bodies (because he said, “die Zahl der Wirbel ist um das doppelte

Brisser als in der Mitte”) Juertne meant by Wirbel the centra + arches, Not

‘ouch fault can be found with such a conception of a “ vertebra.”

& However, the very notion of a vertebra, Wirbel, or spondylus, has been founded
pon the higher Vertebrata, not upon Fishes, many of which have no vertebral

centra; the term vertebra should therefore be restricted to a complete skleromere,

ten skleromeres or vertebra belonging to as many myomeres or neuromeres. In fact

« vertebra is a skleral segment. Hasse (“ Monograph,” p. 21) applied Juerina’s terms only to the centra,
supplanting a somewhat different meaning for these well-meant terms, and thus

causing confusion, especially since he introduced the unfortunate notion of “ Poly-
spondylie,” He mixed up two totally different processes, namely, the increased
number of arcualia in a given segment with the increased number of chorda centra,

else he would not have alluded to the numerous calcareous rings in the chordal sheath
of Chimera. Moreover, by introducing the term “aspondylous” for those fishes which, like
Cyclostomata, have no vertebral centra, he used the term “ spondylous” in a different
sense from what is implied by diplo- and monospondylous.
