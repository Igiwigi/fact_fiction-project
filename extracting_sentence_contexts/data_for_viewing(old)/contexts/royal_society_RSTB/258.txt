accounting for it by a change in position of the body-cavities he has fallen into an
error of no little importance, but one which, owing to the different orientation which
he employs, is not easy to demonstrate. That which in fig. 21 I have marked “ left
body-cavity ” receives the same name in his account, but then he regards this cavity

as occupying the anterior end of the body, and the side marked R in my figure is,
according to him, left. I am not here concerned with the question whether his
orientation is or is not correct; but I wish to call attention to the fact that if we
both used the same orientation we should differ in our nomenclature of the body-
cavities ; in other words, if we interpret his account in terms of the orientation here
adopted, it is the r/ght, and not, as I have stated, the left, body-cavity which assumes
a posterior position.

Besides fig. 21, which has already been explained, figs. 11 and 12 (Plate 43) also
support my account. Fig. 11 represents a transverse section, seen from the posterior
side, through a larva of the fifth day, passing through the posterior part of the larval
mouth, the thickened ectoderm of which marks the ventral side. On the left side
is seen the hydrocele, still opening into the anterior body-cavity ; while on the right
side lies the right body-cavity. The left body-cavity, being posterior to the hydro-
cele, does not appear in this section; but in fig. 12, representing a section near the
