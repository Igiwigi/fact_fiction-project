The effect of absorption may be to raise
or to lower this barrier. If an inhibiting effect on nuclei of the stable solid phase in a system
is greater than the effect on less stable phases the formation of the latter is made more likely. In the present set of experiments we have observed that conditions slightly removed from
those which give rise to metastable phases do, in fact, give rise to visible distortion of the

crystal habit of the stable calcite, as Buehrer & Reitemeier (1940) also noted in the case of
precipitation in presence of Calgon; in addition Raistrick (1949) has demonstrated that
structural requirements for an adsorption of Calgon on calcite are met. With respect to
lattice distortion, as revealed by X-rays, we have noticed that calcite may be distorted in
presence of magnesium salts or Calgon, that vaterite is likewise affected, and that calcium
carbonate monohydrate may be distorted. In short, distortion was common under the
conditions of our experiments.
