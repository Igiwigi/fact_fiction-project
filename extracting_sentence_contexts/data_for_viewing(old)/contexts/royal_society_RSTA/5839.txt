This leads me to the important problem of space-time extensions.

(c) The problem of extensions

The geodesic incompleteness proven by the singularity theorems may simply indicate
incompleteness of the manifold itself, such as excising regular points, with no relation whatsoever
to curvature, conical or similar singularities. This poses an important physical problem: How
to deal with extensible space-times? The answer may seem simple: just extend them until you
cannot extend them any more. However, this is not so simple at all.

Extensions are highly non-unique. As an obvious example, observe that the metric (4.4) is
actually an extension of the exterior region r > rg of the Schwarzschild vacuum solution, but this
is different from the standard analytical one found in the textbooks [14,16]. In fact, physically
meaningful extensions are far from obvious and, furthermore, not even analytical extensions
are unique, nor feasible, in general, let alone smooth extensions. For explicit examples with a
discussion, see [43]. This problem is especially relevant at Cauchy horizons, see [14â€”16,26] for
definitions and figure 3 for several illustrative examples. The regularity class of the extension
is crucial here, see for recent mathematical results [44,45] and references therein.

For a given extensible space-time, there are generically inequivalent extensions leading to

(i) New extensible space-times. This is for instance the case of (4.4), which as shown in
figure 2 is a non-typical extension of the exterior vacuum Schwarzschild space-time.
(ii) Geodesically complete and inextensible space-times, such as the extension of the
previous extension shown in figure 3.
