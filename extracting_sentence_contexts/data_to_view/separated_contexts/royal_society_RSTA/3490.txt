electrostatic units, or 47°3 ampbres per square centimetre. At a pressure
‘0016 this current would become ‘08 ampére per square centimetre. As a matter of
fact, during the experiments, a current of 2°0 amperes per square centimetre was
obtained at *0016 millim. pressure. This is twenty-five times the maximum value
obtained by supposing each molecule to produce one ion; so that it is highly
improbable that any considerable part of the conductivity investigated is due to ions
produced in this way.
