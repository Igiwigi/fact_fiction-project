That silver has an affinity for mercury.

4th. That mercury has an affinity for copper, for lead, and
for arsenic. This $eries ofexperimentsis notintendedas asystem of metallic
affinities ; but as a few facts stated to corroborate an assertion. I am well aware that many others might be noticed; but it is
not my intention to enter further into this subject, in the present
Paper. The general importance of the principle, and the ex-
tensive influence it is likely to have upon chemistry, demand
that it should be treated by multiplied researches, The experi-
ments that can elucidate it are of the most delicate nature, and
require peculiar care; for they do not always succeed, unless

performed under the most favourable circumstances.
