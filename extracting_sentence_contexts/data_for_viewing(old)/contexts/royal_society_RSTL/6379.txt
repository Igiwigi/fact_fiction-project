have enabled me to substitute for them others of greater value; I shall therefore pass
over the work of these seven weeks without further allusion to it.

On the 9th of September of the present year (1860) I resumed the inquiry. For three
weeks I worked with the plate of copper as my source of heat, but finally rejected it on
the score of insufficient constancy. TI again resorted to the cube of hot oil, and continued
to work with it up to Monday the 29th of October. During the seven weeks just
referred to, I experimented from eight to ten hours daily ; but these experiments, though

was one of discipline,—a continued struggle against the difficulties of the subject and
the defects of the locality in which the inquiry was conducted.

My reason for making use of the high sources of heat ours referred to was, that the
absorptive power of some of the gases which I had examined was 80 small that to make
it clearly evident, a high temperature was essential. For other gases, and for all the
vapours that had come under my notice, a source of lower temperature would have
been not only sufficient, but far preferable. I was finally induced to resort to boiling
water, which, though it gave greatly diminished effects, was capable of being preserved
at 80 constant a temperature, that deflections which, with the other sources, would be
masked by the errors of observation, became with it true quantitative measures of
