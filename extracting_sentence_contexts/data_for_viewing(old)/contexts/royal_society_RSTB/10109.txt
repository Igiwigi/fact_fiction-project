The unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and biogeography, proposed by
Hubbell [1] aims to provide a theoretical framework for explaining biodiversity

scale traditionally investigated by ecologists to the regional and long-term
scale more often contemplated by biogeographers and evolutionary biologists.
This neutral theory (abbreviated as NTB hereafter) assumes classically [1]
(i) that biotic communities are essentially governed by random population
drift (i.e. demographic stochasticity hypothesis), (ii) that all individuals irre-
spective of species share the same per capita birth, death, migration and
speciation rates (neutral hypothesis) and (iii) that the number of individuals
in the system is constant through time (zero-sum hypothesis).

Although few biologists would accept these hypotheses as factually correct
or sufficient to describe in detail how communities are organized and
assembled and how they diversify over time (see [2-4] for a summary of the
major criticisms), the neutral theory is surprisingly successful at fitting or
mimicking a number of well-known biodiversity patterns, such as species
abundance distributions (SAD) [5-7], species area relationships (SAR) [8-10],
beta-diversity patterns [11,12], spatial distributions [10,13], levels of endemism
on islands [14] and temporal variability of populations [15]. Whether or not the
NTB accurately fits patterns of biodiversity and biogeography in real commu-
nities [16], Hubbellâ€™s neutral model is now recognized either as a useful
