Twin-arginine-dependent translocation of folded proteins

Julia Frébel, Patrick Rose and Matthias Miller

In this paper, it was stated that degradation of incompletely assembled Fe/S proteins in Escherichia coli was in fact
demonstrated to occur, provided that they could interact with the Tat machinery [152]. However, in contrast to the
original text, interaction with the Tat machinery was shown not to be required for the degradation of incompletely
assembled Fe/S proteins in E. coli [79].
