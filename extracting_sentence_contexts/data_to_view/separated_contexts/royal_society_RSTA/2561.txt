EZER GRIFFITHS ON THE

With the exception of sodium, the smoothed curves have been drawn through the
experimental results of Dorsty and of Ayres in the range 0° C. to —180° C., and

t
the curves extrapolated in order to deduce the value of aev| adt at various tempe-

ratures. For sodium the value 0000224, determined by us in some preliminary experiments
by a new method, has been utilized. This method, which will be described in a later paper, did not indicate any marked
change in the coefficient over the range 0° C. to 95° C.

For low temperature a coefficient of decrease of the same order as that of
cadmium was assumed, a procedure which is justified by the fact that the
coefficient of expansion is proportional to the atomic heat, as shown by GRUNEISEN,
and at low temperature the atomic heat curves of sodium and cadmium are
similar. Nernst and Lrypemann*™ adopt a different procedure, basing their method on
GRUNEISEN’s observation that the coefficient of expansion is proportional to the atomic
heat ; they obtain the approximate relation

C,—G, = GFA stp keane oe

where A is a constant characteristic of the substance which can be deduced from
measurements of the compressibility and coefficient of expansion made at one tempe-
rature,

In the cases of Al, Ag, Pb, and Cu the values so obtained are compared with the values
calculated by means of equation (5), which are utilized in all subsequent comparisons
of theory and experiment in this paper. ;

It is shown in Part IT.
