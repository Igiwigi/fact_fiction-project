However,
Dedekind wanted to avoid any appeal to natural numbers in the development of his general
theory of chains; after all, the natural numbers were to be founded on it. Once the natural numbers
had been given a chain-theoretic characterization, Dedekind established that the approximation
from below and above (as the intersection of all chains containing a\d and closed under h)
yield the same set.° The latter characterization is going to be discussed next to address the two
problematic and deeply related issues I just pointed to: an explicit set-theoretic definition of c and
c* as well as the proof of the structural identities.

5Many proofs, including Kénig’s original one and more contemporary proofs like that of Doyle & Conway [20], define a
partition of a into sets c, c* and r based on the basic insight underlying figure 3; cf. also footnote 4. Scott Weinstein pointed
me to Doyle and Conway’s paper and provided a proof of the graph-theoretic fact that is crucially used there to prove CBT. Weinstein’s proof emphasized for me the parallelism of the Doyle and Conway argument to that of Kénig. In the last part of #131 of [23], one finds an unnumbered theorem that expresses this identity.
