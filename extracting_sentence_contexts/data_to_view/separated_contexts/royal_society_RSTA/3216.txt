It is interesting to note that the
increase of conductivity is, in nearly all cases, greater than the decrease of
viscosity. The foregoing summary shows that failure has attended every attempt which has
© been made to express the power of forming conducting solutions as a function of the
solvent only. As a matter of fact, every solvent exhibits a very marked selective action as
regards the nature of the conducting solute. Thus water dissolves the majority of
salts to form solutions which conduct the current; organic bodies also, other than
salts, are in many cases soluble, but the solutions are not conductors. Hydrocyanic
acid behaves similarly to water, but only a few salts are appreciably soluble in this
é solvent.
