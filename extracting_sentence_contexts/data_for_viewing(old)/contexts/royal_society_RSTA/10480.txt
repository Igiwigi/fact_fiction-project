IMPARTED TO A VACUUM BY HOT CONDUCTORS. 529

filament melted. The arrangement of the apparatus was altered somewhat, the leak
being measured by a Weston ammeter instead of a galvanometer as before ; in other
respects the arrangement was unchanged. The pressure was kept very low and a
potential of about — 60 volts was maintained on the filament, the surrounding
cylinder being earthed.

With this apparatus it was found possible to maintain an actual current of
‘4 ampére (corresponding to 2 AMPERES per square centimetre of filament surface) at
a pressure of Jess than g}9 millim. The current could not be made to surpass this
value since the filament melted on raising it to a slightly higher temperature. The
fact that such large currents can be produced at such low pressures has an important
bearing on the theory of the mechanism by which the corpuscles are produced, which
will be considered later.

$5. The Relation between the Saturation Current and the Temperature.

From the experiments on the variation of the saturation current with the
resistance we have been able to give numbers which indicate, roughly at any rate,
the way in which the former depends on the temperature. It was thought that a
more reliable estimate might be obtained if the temperature of the filament were
determined by means of a thermal junction of platinum and iridio-platinum, With
this object the following experiments were made :—
