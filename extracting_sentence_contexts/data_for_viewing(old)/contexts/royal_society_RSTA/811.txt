Remark 5.2. We remark that many structural properties known for the standard Boussinesq
equation continue to hold for gBouss. For instance, observing that gBouss can be written as the
pair of equations

Ay = —Ux
(5.14)
and Ur = (2@U + H — 3H? + Hyx)x,
we immediately obtain the conservation laws
| H;dX=const. and | U; dX = const., (5.15)
R R

where the first one corresponds to conservation of mass and the second to conservation of
momentum, cf. [26]. In fact, gBouss (as well as gKdV) can be reduced to its classical versions by
employing suitable scalings, so that properties like integrability and the existence of infinitely
many conservation laws carry over. The effect of the Earth’s rotation captured by means of
the Coriolis parameter does not alter the overall qualitative features of solutions, but modifies
slightly some specific quantitative aspects, as can be seen from the explicit solutions of gkdV
and gBouss.

6. Applicability for tsunami modelling

Finally, we comment on the applicability of gkdV and gBouss as models for tsunami wave
propagation. Shallow water models have been frequently used to model the propagation of
