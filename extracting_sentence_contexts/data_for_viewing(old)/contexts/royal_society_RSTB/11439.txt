5. Theory of mind

ToM, often referred to as ‘mentalizing’, is traditionally defined
as the process of inferring the beliefs, thoughts or feelings of
another person, especially when those beliefs differ from
one’s own beliefs [136]. In recent years, the term has been
used to describe other situations involving the ‘self’ and
‘other’, including abstracted social behaviour (e.g. shapes per-
forming social-like behaviours), trait judgements and strategic
social games, among other tasks [171]. It is further complicated
by the fact that ToM relies on thinking about another person,
making it difficult to experimentally isolate from social cogni-
tion. Here, we focus on the original definition of ToM,
inferring the beliefs of others, and specifically focus on the
use of verbal stimuli, e.g. inferring one’s beliefs from a written
story about his/her circumstances and behaviours. This is often
studied by contrasting responses to ‘false belief’ stories, in
which a protagonist acts according to information that the
reader knows to be false, against ‘photo’ descriptions, in
which an outdated photograph is described with some infor-
mation that the reader knows is no longer true [172]. Both
conditions involve verbal descriptions of some false infor-
mation, but only the false belief stories involve imagining the
