In view of the theoretical importance
Zwhich the exact value of N for Hydrogen and for Helium has recently assumed, it
zi necessary that the true value should not remain a matter of doubt, and only a
precise determination of the separations can decide the question. If for example,
the separation in Hs were found to be of the same order as that of a Principal series,
Ey very important correction would be necessary in the observed wave-length of the
Soptical centre of H, which might change N very appreciably. This, in fact, as is
~gshown by the experiments to be described later, actually occurs.

5 (XIIL.) Theoretical Considerations on the Basis of the Quantum Theory.

a) Sommerretp* has recently published a remarkable investigation on the fine
strueture of the lines of the Balmer series. This is based on Bour’s theory of the
origin of this series, and it represents the only manner in which this theory at present
can be applied in order to account for the existence of structure. On the view that
the Hydrogen atom consists of one electron in orbital motion—its path being circular
or elliptical—about a positively charged nucleus, with steady states characterised by
discrete values of the angular momentum, the quantum theory requires the emission
