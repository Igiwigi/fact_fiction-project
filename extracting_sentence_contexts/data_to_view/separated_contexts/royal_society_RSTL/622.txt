Having covered the two large cylindrical
vessels, No. g and No. 4, with gold-beater's skin, I painted one
of them black, with Indian ink; and, filling them both with
boiling hot water, I exposed them to cool, in the manner already
often described, in the air of a quiet room. No. 4, which was blackened, cooled through the standard in-
terval of 10 degrees in 2gz minutes; while the other, No. g,
which was not blackened, took up 28 minutes, in cooling through
the same interval. In .a former experiment, (No. 25,) the instrument No. 4,
covered with gold-beater's skin, but not blackened, had taken
up 275 minutes, in cooling through the given interval, as we
have before seen,

The results of these experiments do not stand in need of illus-
tration; and I shall leave to physicians and, physiologists to deter-
mine what advantages may be derived from a knowledge of the

facts they establish, in taking measures for the preservation of
the health of Europeans who quit their native climate to inhabit
hot countries. All I will venture to say on the subject is, that were I called
to inhabit a very hot country, nothing should prevent me from
making the experiment of blackening my skin, or at least of
wearing a black shirt, in the shade, and especially at night; in
order to find out if, by those means, I could not contrive to
make myself more comfortable. Several of the savage tribes which inhabit very cold countries,
besmear their skins with oil; which gives them a shining ap-
pearance.
