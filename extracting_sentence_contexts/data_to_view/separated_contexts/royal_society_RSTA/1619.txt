The absolute values were obtained from measurements of a number of plates, and are
probably correct to 0-01 A.U., excepting for the heads of the red group, for which the
error may average 0-02 A.U. Tables V and VI give the wave-lengths of the heads of the
violet and the red groups. The only other fine structure measurements of Swan bands are those by Komp (7)
of the 5635 head, Hiypricus (8) of the 4737 head, and Lertnen (9) of the 5165 head,
the data of which were presumably obtained from are photographs. As already
mentioned, the fine structure of the bands is in this case strikingly different in appearance
from that of vacuum tube production—the former produces, in fact, a high temperature
and the latter a characteristically low temperature distribution of energy among the
rotational states. The difference in appearance, together with other peculiarities,
originally suggested to the writer that two distinct systems were involved in each band,
each consisting of a P and an R branch. These were called the “ Tail” system and the
“Head” system, and were investigated extensively as such (vide Section V).
