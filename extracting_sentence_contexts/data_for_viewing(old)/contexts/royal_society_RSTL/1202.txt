same quantity of base in their neutral compounds,

As I had observed the same law to prevail in various other
instances of $uper-acid'and sub-acid salts, I thought it not un-
likely that this law'might obtain'generally in snch compounds,
and it was my design to have'pursued the 'subject with the
hope of discovering the' cause to which s0' regular a relation
might be ascribed.

But since the Siler of Mr. Darron's theory of
chemical combination, as explained and illustrated by Dr.
TrnomsoN,* the inquiry which T had designed appears to be
superfluous, as all the facts that I had observed are but par-
ticular instances of the more general obseryation of Mr.
DaLTox, that in all cases the simple elements of bodies are
disposed'to unite atom to atom singly, or, if either is in excess,
it exceeds by a ratio to be expressed by some simple multiple
of the number of its atoms.
