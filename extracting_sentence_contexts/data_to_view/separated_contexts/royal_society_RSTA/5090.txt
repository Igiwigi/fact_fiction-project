A typical test matrix therefore contains system identification cases
(i.e. free decay, white noise wave, fixed displacement and mooring line force identification cases)
and deterministic and stochastic separate and combined wind and wave cases. Table 1. Important dimensionless numbers for FOWT testing.

The particular challenge of FOWT experimental testing is due to the fact that the system : =
dynamics are governed by both aero- and hydrodynamic loads, which are dominated by different :s
physical properties. To ensure similitude of platform hydrodynamics, the platform properties are !
typically scaled by the dimensionless Froude number (4.1) (see table 1). It describes the ratio : <
of inertial forces to gravitational forces in a fluid, assuming that the influence of viscous effects : 3
present in the thin boundary layer is small compared with the dominant factors, i.e. gravity and 13
inertia.
