The
reason of this last difficulty we must now discuss. To those who have made observa-
tions on compression of the brain it will be easy to understand that, if the pressure
applied had been considerable, and if the blood pressure were low, the brain would not
react immediately upon the withdrawal of the pressure. â€˜This non-reaction, charac-
terised by the brain remaining excavated (through the pressure of the bag, &e.), is
that which we must now analyse. From other experiments, which we shall mention
directly, it is clear that such excavation of the brain substance cannot of itself afford
inhibitory or excitatory impulses passing down to the respiratory and circulatory
centres in the medulla, This view of the facts points to the effect being due to the
mechanical principles before alluded to. (See p. 205.)

That this is true is shown also by another observation which we have made in a
different manner, as follows. If pressure were applied very slowly it was easy to
produce a considerable amount of such excavation as that referred to, without
bringing about any effects, or only slight effects which were easily recovered from. This introduces us to the consideration of the question of compensation in
connexion with the origin of the effect.
