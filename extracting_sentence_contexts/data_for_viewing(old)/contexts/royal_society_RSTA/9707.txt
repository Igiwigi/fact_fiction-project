With a small accelerating potential there was a decided leak with \ 2967, but not
with A 3126.

From these three experiments with different surfaces of cadmium distilled in vacuo,
it appears conclusive that the results satisfy the energy law accurately, and that
LapEenpurRG’s law is incorrect. This conclusion is based on the results for \ 2537,
\ 2257, and . 1849. Additional support is derived from the fact that the photo-electric
effect sets in at the wave-length predicted by the theory.

Zine—Experiments similar to those on cadmium were carried out with surfaces of
distilled zinc. The energy law was found to be obeyed as accurately as in the case
of cadmium, As the experimental results for zinc (and for all the metals subsequently
mentioned) are very similar to those for cadmium, it is unnecessary to reproduce them
here. The velocities in any experiment can be calculated from the values of k and V,
which follow. (Each pair of values for / and V, represents a separate distillation and
a table similar to Tables IT., I11., and IV.)
