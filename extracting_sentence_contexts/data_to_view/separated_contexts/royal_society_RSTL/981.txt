98 Mr. Howmt's Observations on the Structure

Upon what ground Mr. HunTer was led to draw this con-
clusion cannot now be ascertamed ; and, such is my respect
for his opinion, that nothing but the following observations,
Supported by facts, could lead me to form a different one. In considering this subject, it struck me that the 'second sto-
mach, could not be that, in which chyle is formed, since that
process having been completed, any other cavities would be
superfluous. The Iast cavity in all stomachs 'is that, in
which the process must be brought to perfection : and there-
fore the most essential change, which the food undergoes, or
that, by which it is formed into chyle should be performed in
that cavity.
