external to the edge of the medullary plate. Betweeen these two lines the ectoderm
attains its maximum thickness. This is indicated in fig. 72 by the dark crescentic
opacity which constitutes the most lateral, marginal, portion of the cephalic
expansion of the paraxial embryonic zone. The marginal crescentic opacity is thus
the optical expression of the presence of a specially thickened extra-medullary zone
of ectoderm, which is transitional, or intermediate between the medullary plate and
the indifferent ectoderm of the cephalic region.* The crescentic thickening is indeed
simply the Anlage of the cephalic neural crest. Fig. 97 represents a photomicrograph
of a transverse section through a Perameles embryo of the stage now under
consideration. Here, beyond the margin of the medullary plate (m. m. p.), is seen
the intermediate zone of thickened ectoderm (n. ect.). The section figured lies far
forward in the cephalic region, cutting across the anterior thickened extremity of
the archenteron (cf. figs. 69 and 71). Owing to this fact the medullary plate is
narrower, and the extra-medullary intermediate zone of ectoderm is thinner
relatively to the medullary plate, than would be the case a little further back, across
the wider part of the cephalic expansion.

It appears clear that the extra-medullary zone here figured and described must be
regarded as consisting of neural ectoderm, and as forming the ectodermal Anlage
of the “neural crest,” from which, at a slightly later stage, the cephalic ganglionic
outgrowths already described take their origin.

As this intermediate zone of neural ectoderm is continued backwards behind the
cephalic expansion, its definite peripheral limit, in this stage, gradually disappears ;
but it is, nevertheless, still represented by the zone of thick ectoderm which covers
