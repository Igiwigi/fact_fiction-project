Carefully prepared sections
of vessels like fig. 12 demonstrate that these are not modifications of reticulated tissue,
but true spirals, since the threads of lignine seen crossing each other are shown by such
sections to belong to the opposite walls of the yessels. In Captain Arrkex's plant I
found a very few unmistakably reticulated vessels. I have already mentioned the fact
that these vascular bundles are aggregated with varying degrees of compactness. In
fig. 7 a considerable quantity of cellular tissue is interposed between the larger vessels ;
and on turning to fig. 8, a we see two of these sets of intervascular cells, each of which
consists of three or four vertical rows of rectangular cells having a diameter of from
-002 to :0006. Occasionally these cells are almost cubical, but they are usnally elon-
gated in the direction parallel with the vessels between which they are interposed.
