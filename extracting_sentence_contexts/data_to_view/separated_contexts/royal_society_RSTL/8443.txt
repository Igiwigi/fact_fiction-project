It is, as already
Shown, an opinion entertained in high quarters that the wayes of sound are reflected at
Sthe limiting surfaces of the minute particles which constitute haze and fog, the alleged
Swaste of sound in fog being thus explained. If, however, this were an efficient practical
Zane of the stoppage of sound, and if clear calm air be, as alleged, the best vehicle, it
Ewould be impossible to understand how to-day, in a thick haze, the sound reached a
Dans of 124 miles, while on May 20, in a calm and hazeless atmosphere, the maxi-
Smum range was only from 5 to 6 miles. Such facts foreshadow a revolution in our
Enotions regarding the action of haze and fogs upon sound. = Steaming directly in towards the Foreland, at 44 miles, with the paddles going, the
sounds were well heard; at 3 miles upon the same bearing the loudest sound was
very full. We steamed towards Dover Pier end, and at 25%; miles from the. station, on
the line between it and the pier, all sounds, as usnal, fell considerably.
