A similar interpretation can be applied to the behaviour of the polyphagous T7richo-
gramma evanescens, which is so occupied with size or quantity in selecting hosts, that in
the laboratory the females choose large hosts unsuitable for the development of their
progeny (or even large false hosts in which no progeny can be deposited) although the
normal small host, Sifotroga, is present. Marchal (1936) showed that Trichogramma sp.
bred from eggs of Mamestra brassicae paid little attention to suitable hosts such as
Sitotroga, Ephestia and Pieris, which were smaller than their normal host. It seems,
therefore, that this chalcid has a natural bias for large hosts, and in giving this parasite
a choice between the small Sitotroga and a large host unsuitable for the development
of its progeny a complication is introduced. In the laboratory the oviposition response
of the Trichogramma is to any object of a size sufficient to contain an adult parasite—
an observation of considerable importance because it indicates that the parasite has
some appreciation of volume. But the fact that the chalcid exists in nature indicates
that the factors recognized by analysis as leading a female parasite to a given ecological
station must be such that, as a general rule, these objects must also be characterized by
other features, which enable the progeny of the parasite to develop. Thus, in reality,
“object of a given size’’ becomes synonymous with a normal host, for the most common
objects of this size occurring in the particular environment of Trichogramma are eggs of
various insects, which from their nature contain other characters co-existent with this
size factor. The stupidity of the actions of the female is more apparent than real, for
in recognizing the so-called ecological and psychological selection, the investigator
is confusing isolation in thought with isolation in nature.

It seems, therefore, that the contention that a parasite generally ‘‘chooses”’ as its
hosts those which are suitable for the development of its progeny must be accepted
