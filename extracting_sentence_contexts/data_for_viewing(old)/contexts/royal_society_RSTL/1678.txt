4. The britliancy or ſplendor of the eleQric fluid i its
paſlage through any body is always increaſed by leflening the;
dimenſions of that body. I would explam my meaning by ſay"
ing, that a ſpark, orthe diſcharge of a battery which we might,
ſuppoſe equal to a fphere one quarter of an inch in diameter,
would appear much more brilliant if the ſame quantity of fluid”
is compreſſed into, a ſphere one-cighth of an inch in diameter.y
This obſervation is the obvious conſequenceof many known facts.
If the machine be large cnough to afford a ſpark whoſe lengths!
is nine or ten inches, this ſpark may be ſeen ſometimes formin }
itſelf into a bruſh, in which ſtate it occupies more room, but ap=#
pears very faintly luminous. Ar other tunes the ſame ſpark.may?
be ſeen dividing itſelf into a variety of ramifications which ſhoot?
into. the ſurrounding air. In this caſe, ikewife, the fluid is
diffuſed over a large ſurface, and in proportion to the extent ofs
that ſurface, ſo is the faintneſs of the appearance, A ſpark,»
which in the open air cannot exceed one quarter of an inch in,
diameter, will appear to fill the whole of an exhauſted receiver;
four inches wide and eight inches long. But in the former”
caſe it is brilliant, and in the latter it grows fainter and fainter!
