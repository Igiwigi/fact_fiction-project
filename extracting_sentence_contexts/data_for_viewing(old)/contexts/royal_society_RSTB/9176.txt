straints may have reduced the overall evolvability of the birth
canal in earlier hominins, but that these constraints became
weaker in later hominins. A study of regional skeletal vari-
ability in recent human populations found that the pelvic
canal was, in fact, the most variable trait, suggesting that
stabilizing selection is no longer a major constraint [36].

While such genetic change can be assumed to have played a
role in the evolving obstetric dilemma, it also appears insufficient
as an explanation for the contemporary burden of mortality from
obstructed labour. Whatever the selective pressures acting on
adult encephalization and locomotion, the obstetric dilemma
is, in fact, the consequence of a clash not between two adult
traits, but between two developmental traits—growth of the
maternal pelvis and fetal growth. Their interaction at the
time of birth makes resolution of the dilemma a complex two-
party process, and selection furthermore acts not only on the
traits per se, but also on their coordination. Since maternal
growth occurs a generation ahead of offspring growth, their
co-adaptation to ecological stresses takes on the form of a
‘three-legged race’ (figure 2), in which the two traits are linked
without the possibility of perfect phenotypic integration.

We need to gain greater insight into the non-genetic mech-
anisms whereby the obstetric dilemma can be renegotiated in
