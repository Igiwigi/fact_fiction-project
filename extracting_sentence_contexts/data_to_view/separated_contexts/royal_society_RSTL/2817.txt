Itis then
set aside to crystallize, It is well to prepare a number of these plates at once, varying
the relative proportion of the acid and alt, in order that the desired kind of crystal-
lization may be found in one or other of them ; for there is a considerable variety in
the crystalline forms obtained by this method, some of which indeed are very sin-
gular. But when that kind of crystallization takes place which it is more particu-
larly my intention to speak of, the field of view of the microscope is seen covered
with minute circular spots, each of which is like a tuft of silk radiating from a centre,
and is composed of a close assemblage of delicate acicular crystals forming a star. But besides these, are seen interspersed among them a number of circular transparent
bodies, which are evidently modifications of the former, being, in fact, tufts or stars
of acicular crystals in such close assemblage as to be in optical contact with each
other and to produce the appearance of a single individual. Now let us suppose a
group of these circles to be under examination with the polarizing microscope, and
when the polarizers are crossed, we observe the following phenomenon. The field
