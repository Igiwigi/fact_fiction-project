Thus, for instance, using the largest planar cell cul-
ture system (robotic version of a 120 layers HYPERstack vessel
(60.000 cm? unit~’), consisting of 64 subunits providing a cul-
ture surface area of 3.84 x 10°cm?) an expansion run can
generate between 120 x 10° cells (MSCs) and 768 x 10° cells
(human PSCs). Based on culture surface area, a similar cell quantity can
be produced using a 350 | reactor culture with a microcarrier
density of 2.5 g 1” (calculation base: Cytodex 1 as example). With respect to minimal medium requirements (no medium
