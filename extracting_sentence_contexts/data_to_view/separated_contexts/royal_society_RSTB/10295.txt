Such conditions are not
fulfilled in a large number of organisms that have mixed sexual
and asexual reproductive modes, which include taxa from all
kingdoms, from bacteria to animals and plants. Yet any serious
universal explanation on the maintenance of sex needs to be
compatible with these cases of facultative sex. In fact, Williams
[1] used his ‘balance argument’ [2], which is quoted above,
to postulate the existence of a universal, or at least a very
broadly applicable mechanism that could counter-balance in
the short term the costs of sexual reproduction in facultative
sexual organisms. But are universal explanations required at
all in such cases or can lineage-specific mechanisms explain
maintenance of intermediate rates of sex? In this study, we examine whether a lineage-specific
mechanism alone (a diapause stage linked to sex; see below
‘Traits linked to sex in facultative sexuals’) can prevent loss
of sex in a facultative sexual organism.
