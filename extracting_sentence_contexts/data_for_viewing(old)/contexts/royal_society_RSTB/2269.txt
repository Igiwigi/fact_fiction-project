segmented cord must be extraordinarily complete. The connection between the
ndings of the afferent fibres and motor cells of other segments may be as close
& between them and any of the neurons. It follows that, in many instances at
Bast, excitation of their own segment applied in minimal or approximately minimal
Gegree to a single afferent root or of a fraction of a single afferent root evokes
Pluri-segmental “motor” discharge, Now I have shown that the group of motor
qeurons innervating a limb muscle, ¢.g., flexor brevis, hallucis, or pollicis, is composed
gf individual neurons, belonging not merely to one but to two and three adjacent
‘ppinal segments.* From the above it is clear that the rule of segmental proximity
Hoes not operate to the extent of making motor neurons belonging to one segment in
‘Zhe pluri-segmental motor nucleus greatly more accessible by its own afferent root
‘Shan are by that root the motor neurons of the other segments composing the
sag in fact they are only very slightly if in any degree more so. Here
‘again facts lend no countenance to the assertion that the collection of fibres in
Bach motor root represents one highly co-ordinate functional synergy. On the
‘Sontrary they indicate that not the whole motor root, but particular fractional
~tombinations of several motor roots are, in spinal reflex actions, to be considered
Anits. The afferent channels of the cord treat the pluri-segmental motor stations
Sr nuclei of these limb muscles as entities of homogeneous structure, as in fact

Physiological units.

3 From the foregoing it follows naturally that the reflex centrifugal discharge
of the spinal cord is pluri-segmental, The rule may be stated thus: in response to
Beeitation even approximately minimal of a single afferent root, or even of a single
