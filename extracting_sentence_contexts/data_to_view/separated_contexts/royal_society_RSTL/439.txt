No earthy substance
is now thought fit to be submitted to further experiment, till a
complete solution of it in an acid be first obtained; and, when
that solution cannot be effected directly bythe acid, it is always
attempted by previous fusion- with! an» alkali.» This mode of
rendering: silica' soluble-in acids, is no new discovery; it has
been long known ; and/the-analysis of minerals has never been
brought $0 near to truth, as since-it has become an indispensable
condition. ,

'T have no doubt as to the fact of a precipitate being formed,
by mixing together an' alkaline solution of silica and alumina. Alumina indeed appears to exercise an-attraction, as I before
stated, for silica, for magnesia, and for lime. All stones in which
