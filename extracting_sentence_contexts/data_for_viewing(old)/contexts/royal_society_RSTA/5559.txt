both conditions (figure 6). This finding indicates a prevalence of redundancy over synergy that is
confirmed also by PID looking at the small values of synergistic information Sjs,y; and at the
high values of the redundant information RjsRj,7, which decreases significantly moving from R
to T (figure 7). The prevalence of redundancy indicates the importance of common pathways of
interaction occurring between R and H mediated by S. Finally, we note that the computation of
measures not involving respiration (i.e. Fs, in figure 6 and Us,x in figure 7) leads to similar
results to those observed for the same measures computed in the presence of D in place of R
(respectively, figures 3 and 4), showing a tendency of the information shared between HP and
systolic pressure to increase when computed in the LF band, and to decrease when computed in
the HF band, with the transition from R to T.

The little relevance within the LF band of the measures of multivariate interaction involving
the respiratory volume is due to the known fact that the variability of respiration and its effects
on the variability of HP and arterial pressure are almost exclusively confined in the HF band of
the spectrum [2]. The significant decrease with tilt of the information shared between respiration
and HP (measures Fispj,44, Fr;x, Ur) confirms a number of previous investigations based
on entropy analysis [10,11,16,25] that documented a reduction of cardiorespiratory interactions
during orthostatic stress. Physiologically, these findings reflect the vagal withdrawal and the
dampening of respiratory sinus arrhythmia occurring with tilt [39]. Finally, the analysis of the
measure of interaction information (Is;r;7,) and of its expansion into purely redundant and purely
synergistic terms (Risryj;n, S[sry;n) helps in investigating the two physiological mechanisms
that may explain the effects of respiration on the HP known and respiratory sinus arrhythmia
(RSA), i.e. the direct pathway whereby neural commands originating in the respiratory centres
of the brainstem act on the sinus node independently of blood pressure [8], and the indirect
pathway whereby respiratory effects on the arterial pressure are transmitted to the HP via
