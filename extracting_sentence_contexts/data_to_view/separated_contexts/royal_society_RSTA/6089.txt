The latter approach is
more encompassing, but requires one to use a redundancy function (see §3) and usually scales
poorly with number of parts—making its calculation in large systems very challenging. The
former approach focuses on a particular feature, but circumvents those problems allowing one
to deal with large systems. In the following, the case studies reviewed in §5a use the practical
criteria (i.e. not requiring a choice of redundancy function), while most in §5b calculate dynamical
synergy (i.e. requiring a specific redundancy function).

5This mathematical fact implies that this framework does not support phenomena that are not describable by nth-order
interactions.
