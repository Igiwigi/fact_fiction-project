ing challenge, whereas studies of human ERV (HERV) expression are small
with no clear consensus [5,6]. The fact that extensive research on HERVs has
not shown clear pathologies, in contrast to ERVs in several other animals,
suggests that research in HERVs still needs to be performed, but only within
a rigorous and robust experimental framework. We argue that researchers
have been ‘there’ (i.e. searched for potential pathogenic roles of ERVs) and
failed likely owing to technological restrictions and fragmentary knowledge
of cancer and autoimmunity, but now it is time to ‘go back again’.

Here, we summarize what we consider to be the most promising lines of
ERV research that might illuminate the role of HERVs in pathophysiology.
We emphasize the most important questions of the role of HERVs on human
pathophysiology and describe some of the challenges that need to be tackled
in order to have clearer understanding of HERVs’ ecology. We start with a
