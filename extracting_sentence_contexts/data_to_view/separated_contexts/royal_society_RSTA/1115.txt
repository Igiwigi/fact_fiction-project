source and neocyanine plates, but no Raman lines originating from these wave-lengths
were found even after 60 hoursâ€™ exposure. At low temperatures. In view of the fact that the infra-red spectrum is unaltered at the temperature of
liquid oxygen, it was important to examine the Raman spectrum likewise at this tempera-
ture. Diamond D 1 was fitted into a Dewar vessel similar to that shown in fig. 6 (b), the
radiation, being condensed on the face of the diamond, and that scattered at right angles
being collected by the spectrograph.
