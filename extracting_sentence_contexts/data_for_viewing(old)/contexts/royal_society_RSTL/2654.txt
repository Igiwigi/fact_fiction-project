sensation simply, as well as those which supply the organs of manducation, are
situated below it, along the ventral surface of the animal. Upon close examination
it will be found that when the motor column in passing from the thorax to the head
has arrived at the crura which descend from the brain on both sides of the <sophagus,
it appears to wind round to the outer surface and unite with the base of the antennal
nerves, where the column appears to terminate. Tt is in the median line above and
between the two double cords that the transverse nerves originate (b), as described
in my former paper; and these also unite with the nerves to the antenne by very
small filaments. This inclines me to consider them as forming part of one great
system of nerves, which are more of an involuntary than of a voluntary character.
Of this great system the sympathetic nerves doubtless form a part, of which the
transverse nerves perhaps may be only a peculiar modification. It is a remarkable
fact, that while the musecles of the wings are supplied with nerves which in every stage
of the insect's existence originate by double roots, one of which is derived from the
motor tract of the cords before it arrives at a ganglion, and the other both from a
ganglion of the sensitive tract and from the motor tract which passes over it, they
are also supplied with large nerves from the transyerse series, as may be best seen in
the larva, long before the organs unto which they are giyen are called into activity.
But this is not the case with the muscles of the legs, which are supplied only with
very minute filaments from the transverse series, in addition to their compound or
moto-sensitive nerves. The reason for this difference in the distribution of the nerves
to the wings and legs is clearly on account only of their difference of function, the
wings being more directly concerned than the legs in the acts of respiration. Pro-
fessor MULLERÂ® has recently thrown out some valuable hints with regard to the nature
of these transverse nerves ; he seems to consider them as peculiar neryes which com-
