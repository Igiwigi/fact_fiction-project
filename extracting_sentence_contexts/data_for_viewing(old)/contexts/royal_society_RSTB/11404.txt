that are distributed among my linguistic community [21].

Usually, this socially mediated way of using concepts
involves deference [22]. By deferring to experts, my ELM and
BEECH concepts are connected to distinctive characteristics
encoded by them. Deference about how to distinguish elms
from beeches is one source of grounding.‚Äù If I do have
views about what distinguishes elms from beeches, for
example, having internalized some prototypical silhouette
that makes me apply my BEECH concept, I hold those views
tentatively. I stand to be corrected. I revise my conception
when faced with someone who knows better. I may also
defer about other facts about elms, beyond those used to
pick them out or distinguish them, e.g. what to do with
elm wood, how to cut it or use it. These are further plausibly
distinctive grounding characteristics.

Linguistic labels combined with deference are good
distinctive characteristics for grounding abstract concepts.
Even with emotion concepts, where there are already rich
internal resources as we have seen, linguistic deference may
be responsible for grounding some fine-grained differences.
For example, my SHAME and GUILT concepts are certainly
different, and I remember once being persuaded of what
the differences are and why they are important. Not being
