showed that, although the protoplasxm had contracted, those portions projecting into
the pits 8till adhered to the pit membrane, and that the threads of protoplasm running
through the pit membrane were continuous on either side with the above-mentioned
symmetrically opposite processes (figs. 14 and 15). The processes, in fact, appear to
be held to the pit membrane by the threads in question in all cages where the con-
tinuity is pronounced. Under a low power the individual threads could not be
distinguished, and the appearance then presented was that of two darkly-stained
threads united by a lighter-stained area running between them—in fact, the very
appearance presented by Mimosa and Robina* (0. figs. 5, 7, 14, and 15). In the
cage of ripening s8eeds, the protoplasm may be made to contract slightly from the
membrane, and then a similar phenomenon is induced to that which occurs in Amicia
and the bast cells of Mimosa (cf. figs. 11 and 13), although in them it is not occa-
sioned by loss of vitality, bub rather from the fact that the threads are probably
extremely fine and the continuity not 80 pronounced as it is in the case. of the
parenchyma cells. In fully-ripe seeds where the cells are dead, the protoplagm always
contracts away from the cell-wall, and a similar state of things usually occurs when
the cell has been killed by the action of reagents (see figs. 16 and 22), Thus, both my
method and my results have received very satisfactory confirmation and elucidation,

II. General results with Tipe endosperms.—As a rule, mos of the seeds I examined
were either one or, at most, two years old. I als» made use of some museum spe-
cimens, but decided to reject the results I obtained. with them, as. I had reason to
believe that in many cases those results were abnormal, As regards their favourable
or unfayourable character as material for showing the perforation of the cell-wall by
protoplasmic threads, seeds greatly differ one from another. In the firsb place, it
