Now consider the possibility that (X?+ Y?) Z is equi-
valent to 2

/{23(1 a Ee + (AP+4Q)?) R, (106)

where A and are real, As
PP+Q?+ (AP+ HQ)? = (14+-A? +p?) P?+(1+A2+42) Q?—(uP—AQ)?,
it is clear that the minimum of the absolute value of (106) lies between the limits
2 " [PS +424 4?)
/{23(1+ 22+ 2)}? Nk
As these limits are arbitrarily near to 2/,/(28) if A and y are arbitrarily small, the inequality
(104) certainly cannot be isolated unless we exclude the possibility that (X?-+ ¥2) Z is
equivalent to (106). We shall, however, prove that the inequality (104) is in fact isolated, if the above possi-
bility is excluded, and that this isolation still applies if an infinity of solutions are required. For this we need three lemmas. We denote by K the body in three-dimensional space
defined by | (x2-+y2)z]<1.
