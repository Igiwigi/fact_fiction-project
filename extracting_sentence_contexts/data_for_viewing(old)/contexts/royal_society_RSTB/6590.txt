form (Geroplatus) and nine pairs of similar, and one pair of functional spiracles in the
propneustic forms (Diadocidia and Speolepta), occupying the same place as the eight
pairs of functional spiracles and two pairs of non-functional spiracles (metathoracic
and eighth abdominal) which are present in all Mycetophilid larvae.

The larvae of Ditomyidae, Scatopsidae, and Bibionidae are peripneustic. The
first and second carry nine pairs of spiracles, the third carries ten pairs. In all these
forms, however, the last abdominal spiracles are more developed than the rest,
showing a tendency to the metapneustic condition. The larvae of Mycetophilidae,
on the other hand, show a tendency to become propneustic—a very rare condition
in nematocerous larvae. Evidence in support of this statement is afforded by the

following facts :—

1. The prothoracic spiracles are first developed in the second stage larva and
persist in subsequent stages. The abdominal spiracles, on the other hand, are only
developed in the fourth stage larva.

2. The prothoracic are better developed than the abdominal spiracles in all
Mycetophilid larvae without exception, consisting of 2-7 spiracular openings,
whereas the abdominal spiracles consist of a single opening.
