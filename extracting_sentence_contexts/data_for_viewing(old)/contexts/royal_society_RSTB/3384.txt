the observed figures and those calculated in the two different ways.

It will be seen that if we consider the figures calculated from the formula
B= Wi/k, the greatest individual deviations between the calculated and observed
figures are + 12°87 per cent. and — 10°59 per cent.; and the average deviation
for the individual experiments calculated in this way is 4°61 per cent. If, on the
other hand, the experiments are calculated in the way which has been made use of by
all previous observers, namely, that the blood volume equals the weight multiplied
by the percentage of blood, the greatest individual deviations are + 43°3 per cent.
and — 11°39 per cent., and the average deviation for the individual experiments
calculated in this way is 9°11 per cent. From this there is no doubt that if
the blood volumes are calculated according to our view, a much better representa-
tion of the experimental facts is given than if calculated as percentage of body weight,
as has invariably been done hitherto.

Since, however, the difference in the percentage deviation between the values
observed and the values calculated by the two methods will depend to a very large
extent upon the size of the animals, there is really only one way to make clear the
difference in the percentage amount of blood in animals of the same species of
varying weight, and that is to group the animals of about the same weights together.
If this be done, the individual variations will to a great extent disappear, and the
actual differences between the various groups of weights will not be obscured.
