will be seen that they lend considerable support to the view which has been put
forward already, that when regeneration takes place from any particular section of
segments it proceeds until the section comes to occupy in the new worm the same
position which it occupied in the old one.

The records need to be treated with some caution, and are not well adapted for
statistical study, since there was certainly some selection in picking out the
particular specimens which were examined, in favour, on the one hand, of those which
showed obvious signs of regeneration and in which therefore regeneration was still in
a moderately early stage, and, on the other hand, of those large specimens in which
regeneration was nearly complete, which were specially searched for. The points to
be considered here are not affected by such selection, however, unless a particular
statement is made to indicate the fact.

Regeneration from three and four Original Segments.
The records in Table II are arranged in groups according to the number of original

segments from which regeneration has taken place. The two most important groups

are those with three and four original segments. Of those with three original
segments there are sixty-three specimens of which records of both anterior and
