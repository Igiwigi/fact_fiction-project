worked in the ice by glacial streams, they present a most beautiful appearance, They are
not to be regarded as a partial phenomenon, or as affecting the constitution of glaciers
to a s8mall extent only. Vast masses of some glaciers are thus affected: by far the
greater part of the Mer de Glace, and its tributaries, is composed of this laminated ice.
The lower portion of the glacier of the Rhone, from the base of the ice cascade down-
wards, is entirely composed of it, and numerous similar cases might be cited.

'To observe the structure of a glacier it is not even necessary to see the blue veins.
'Those who have ascended Snowdon, or wandered among the hills of Cumberland, or
even walked in the environs of Leeds or other towns in Yorkshire and Lancashire, where
the stratified sandstone of the district is used for architectural purposes, will have
observed the exposed edges of the slate rocks, and of the stratified sandstone, to be
grooved and furrowed by the action of the weather. Tn fact some portions of snch rocks
withstand the action of the atmosphere better than others, and these more resisting
portions stand out in ridges while the softer portions between them are worn away.
An effect exactly similar is observed upon the surface of the glacier. The laminated

ice, exposed to the sun, and to wasting atmospheric influences, melts in a manner similar
to the wasting of the rocks; little grooves and little ridges are formed upon the surface
of the glacier, the latter being due to the more resisting ice, while the grooves are pro-
duced by the melting of the less resisting mass between them.
