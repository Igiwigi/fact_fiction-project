summit 165*. The crystal I have just described, would then be
nothing more than the prismatic modification, combined with
that which occasions this rhomboid ; at both extremities of which,
one of the faces of each of the obtuse triedral pyramids, be-
longing to-the new rhomboid, would have acquired (in a con-
trary direction with respect to its extremities) such an increase
as would cause the other faces to disappear. 'These two faces,
having now become the terminal ones of the hexaedral prism,
would in fact make, with those edges of the prism on which
they would incline, angles of 100? and' 809.
