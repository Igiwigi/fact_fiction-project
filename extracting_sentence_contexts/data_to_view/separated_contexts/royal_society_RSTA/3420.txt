Once again, using DUSTY [100] with Ossenkopf silicates [106], we find that
the dust excess from extended circumstellar matter (CSM) around the star is © 2.5 mag and that,
with an input Ter = 3500K, the star had Lyo) ~ 10°? Lo, ie. a higher luminosity than that of the
SN 2012aw progenitor. This is consistent with the fact that the SN 2013ej progenitor is brighter
at Ks; (the band least affected by extinction) than the SN 2012aw progenitor. From the GRAMS
fitting to the two SED datapoints, we find that Lyol 10°! Lo and Teg © 3300 K.
