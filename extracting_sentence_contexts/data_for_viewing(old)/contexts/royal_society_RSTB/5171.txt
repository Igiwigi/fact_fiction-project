Prof. Bartey Wiis divided the physiographic history of northern and central China
into four stages ; the first he named the Pei-tai, during which was formed the Cretaceous
and early Kainozoic peneplane ; second the Tanghien, a period of great erosion ; third,
the Hin-chou, the chief deposition of loess ; fourth, the Fon-ho, beginning in the Pliocene
but mainly Pleistocene, and marked by great continental uplift, during which the rivers
further deepened their valleys, but there was comparatively little land sculpture.

The succession described by Prof. BAtrLEy WILLIs is in the main consistent with the
evidence in Yunnan, except as regards his interpretation of the last period, the Fon-ho.
According to him central China had been worn down to a low plain which lasted into the
Pleistocene (Quaternary), when it was raised by a regional uplift of about 12,000 feet
(BatLey WILLIS, 1907, pp. 108, 111). This uplift is regarded as also having affected
the regions to the N. and W.; in fact, according to this view, the great mountains of
western China and the Tibetan tableland of east central Asia were raised from a little
above sea-level during the age of man.

The similarities between the history of Yunnan and of central China are so close that
if Battey WILLIsâ€™s view be adopted for North China and the middle part of the Yangtze
basin, the plateau of Yunnan and the surrounding regions should also have been uplifted
during the Pleistocene. We saw, however, no evidence of any such great regional uplift.
There is, for example, no evidence of any Upper Kainozoic marine deposits either in
Yunnan or the surrounding countries. Marine deposits belonging to the Eocene and
Miocene extend far up the Irawadi valley ; but the Pliocene deposits there are terrestrial
or fresh-water. The Pliocene and later beds in the basins of Yunnan are also terrestrial
or fresh-water.
