of lime. Muriate of copper would therefore remain with the
earthy hyperoxygenized muriates; or, what is still worse, a
part of the muriatic acid being easily expelled from oxide of
copper, the hyperoxygenized muriatic acid would be driven off
from its basis, by the more powerful agency of the former.
This salt has all the properties enumerated as belonging to the
genus of hyperoxygenized muriates ; and, with heat, the acid is
expelled by all acids above the benzoic. I had hoped that, without
distillation, I could procure the acid from the salt by means of
sulphuric acid, which would have left an insoluble salt with
barytes ; but hyperoxygenized muriatic acid is 80 easily decom-
posed by light, that I have not yet obtained it, to my satisfaction,
disengaged and pure. A fact well worthy of attention is, that
the stronger acids disengage this acid with a flash of light,

more frequently from the earthy than from the alkaline hyper-

oxygenized muriates; a phenomenon which, I suppose, depends

upon the relative proportionate affinities, and consequently the

greater rapidity of the disengagement. But, where all is hypo-
