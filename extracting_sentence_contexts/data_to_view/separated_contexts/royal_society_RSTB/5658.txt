This coincidence might, of course, be due to the presence of compensating ratios. Some of the groups (e.g.,2 A, 4 K or 10 A, 0 K) are not very near 3: 1, anditesting
the six gen. 4 groups for homogeneity gives a P of only 0-04. A thorough
analysis of all the data (summed in Table 35) does not, however, show any
certain divergence from a 3:1 ratio, nor any clear differences between strains
or generations, and taking them as a whole the facts fit pretty well with the
theoretical segregation, though the possibility of there being some underlying
diversity, possibly a cytoplasmic effect, must be borne in mind. * According as whether the broods from pairs are reckoned as one or two.
