accelerate the time of death, as is the case with Sepedon venom. We have not,
however, found this to be true of Echis venom, Further, it is well known that the
neurotoxins of snake venoms are much less easily destroyed by heat than the heemo-
toxins. If the neurotoxin is present only in small amount, one would expect to find
that heating the venom to such an extent as to impair or destroy only the hemo-
toxins would markedly diminish the toxicity of the venom. We performed a series
of experiments on rats to determine the lethality of heated Echis venom and found
that the minimum lethal dose by subcutaneous injection of venom which had been
kept in solution at a temperature of 78 to 80° C. for 30 minutes was 0°008 grm. per
kilogramme—that is to say, the heated venom possessed only one-tenth the lethality
of the unheated venom. It might be inferred that one-tenth of the toxic power of
the venom was due to neurotoxin, but against this assumption is the fact that the rat
which died of the heated venom showed hemorrhages, both local and remote. It is
more probable, therefore, that heating to this extent does not completely destroy the
heemotoxins of the venom.
(b) Nerves.

Not only is there an absence of evidence pointing to a direct action of this venom
on the central nervous system, but there is likewise no evidence of an action on the
nerves or nerve terminals of voluntary muscle. Thus in the frog (Experiment 6),
faradic stimulation of the sciatic nerve with the secondary coil at 400 mm. induced
tetanus of the gastrocnemius muscle, after failure of the circulation and respiration.
It is interesting to note in this connection that elevation of the lower eyelids of the
frog, which is a conspicuous symptom of curare-like poisons and which is invariably
