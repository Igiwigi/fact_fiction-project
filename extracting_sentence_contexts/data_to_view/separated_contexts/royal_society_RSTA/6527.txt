But
there is a limit to the smallness, owing to two causes. The moment of inertia is made
up of two parts, the circuit and the mirror, on which account, when the moment of
inertia of the mirror becomes comparable with that of the circuit, the smaller instru-
ment will have a greater moment of inertia, and, therefore, its sensibility on this
account will be less than that given by the above rule. The second reason why there is a superior limit to the sensibility as the instrument
is reduced in size is due to the fact that the sensitive plate conducts more heat from
the hot to the cold junction in the case of the shorter plate, and thus, for a given rate
of radiation, the junction will not be so hot ; and, hence, the current will be less than
it would be if the diminished resistance were the only cause of change. It is, there-
fore, necessary to choose some length of plate or width of rectangle which can
conveniently be made in practice, and, assuming this as a constant, to find by
calculation the best values of all the variables, and so, as it were, to fit to the plate
the best possible instrument. Something must be assumed as a starting point, and
this seemed, on the whole, the most convenient.
