the shell gland as a typical antennal gland. If now, the account of the development of
the shell gland given in this paper is accepted as correct, it follows that the gland cannot
in any way be considered as homologous with the segmental excretory organ of any
other Crustacean. â€˜The one essential of any such organ is that its end sac must repre-
sent the remains of the coelom and therefore must be mesodermal in origin. The origin
of the efferent duct, as will be pointed out later, is different in different forms and hence
has no critical value in this respect. Now that part of the gland considered by BERGoLp
and others to represent the end sac is the one part of the gland of which it can be said
definitely that it is ectodermal in origin, and therefore that it cannot constitute the
end sac of a crustacean segmental excretory organ. What the origin of the other two
parts of the gland may be cannot be said, but this is immaterial as it has never yet been
suggested that either of these represents the end sac. Apart, however, from the
development of the gland, the simple fact that in the base of the antenna there occurs
an organ that, as will be shown later, agrees in all essentials with the antennal gland of
Kstheria, is alone sufficient to indicate conclusively that the shell gland cannot represent
the antennal gland.

The actual function of the shell gland is not at all clear. A point in its development
that suggests that its present function is secondary, is that it originates in connection
with the outer ectodermal shell fold, but later develops a connection with the inner
layer, and finally loses all connection with the outer. ~Thus it may represent an ecto-
dermal gland that was present before the shell fold originated, and that, with the develop-
ment of the latter, the inner end of the gland found itself in contact with the inner
layer of ectoderm and acquired a new opening in this region.
