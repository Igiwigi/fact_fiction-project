A comparison of Lepidosiren with Ceratodus shows that a positively defined boundary
between the vertebral column and skull does not exist, that parts which in one genus
appear to belong to the skull, are distinctly portions of the vertebral column in the other,
and that, with regard to the particular bone which has been 80 differently interpreted
by the authors named, the opinion first expressed was nearest to the truth. 'The peculiar
bone in Batrachus, to which Peters directed attention, is in fact nothing but the first
rib (se GUNTHER, © Fishes,” yol. iii. pp. 167, 172), extending and fixed to the upper end
of the humerus. Although its insertion into the top of the neurapophysis is a most

of the neurapophysis, then to the centre of the axis, and finally to the parapophysis,
shows clearly that this bone is a rib. Nor is the application of parapophysial elements
of the first vertebra, for support of the scapular arch, of very rare occurrence in fishes ;
