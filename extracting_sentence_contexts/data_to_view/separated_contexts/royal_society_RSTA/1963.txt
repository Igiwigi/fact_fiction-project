This could be interpreted in
many ways. Le Verrier might have wanted to show indirectly that Adams, the person who
‘spoiled’ his Neptune prediction, was wrong, continuing a sort of scientific vendetta [65]. On
the other hand, the fact that Le Verrier does not mention Adams at all could be considered in an
opposite sense, that Le Verrier did not want to draw Adams into a long-standing fight he had

with Delaunay (for details see [74]). Adams was most directly attacked by Pontécoulant, both in : =
French and British journals [69,70], and a biographer of Adams should not forget his rebuttal of : =
the accusations published in the Monthly Notices in 1860. The Adams of 1860 was a very different 13
person from the Adams of the mid-1840s.
