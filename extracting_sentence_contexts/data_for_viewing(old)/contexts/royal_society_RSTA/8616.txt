The phenomenon which was observed was the same in each case. The layer of coloured
liquid suddenly gathered itself into a series of equidistant films whose planes were .
perpendicular to the axis of rotation. These films were in each case spaced at a distance
apart nearly equal to twice the thickness between the cylinders. The films seemed to
spread out till they reached*the inner surface of the outer cylinder. They then spread
upwards and downwards close to that surface till they covered it with a thin film of
coloured liquid. This film was almost invisible because it could not be seen edge-on.
On the other hand, when the upward and downward flowing sheets met at the points
half-way between the out-flowing films they formed inward-flowing films of the same
type as the outward-flowing ones. The resulting appearance after the motion had
been going on for about two or three seconds was that of a series of thin equi-distant
planes of coloured fluid spaced at a distance equal to the thickness of the space between
the cylinders. In fact, after the first few seconds the motion appeared to get to a steady
state in which it was impossible to distinguish the outward-flowing films from the
inward-flowing ones, though all of them were extremely sharply defined.

Photographs of the Stream Lines.

Considerable difficulty was experienced in obtaining satisfactory photographs of the
phenomenon because when eosin was used instead of fluorescene a more concentrated
solution was necessary ; and it was found difficult to make up this solution so that its .
density remained the same as that of water when it was surrounded by water. It
frequently happened in fact that the coloured liquid formed two columns, one going up
and the other down, when strong eosin solution mixed with alcohol was used. In
spite of this and other difficulties some fairly good photographs were obtained.
