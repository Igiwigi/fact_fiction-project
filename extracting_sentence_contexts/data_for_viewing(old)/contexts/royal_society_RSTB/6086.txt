possible that there is some individual variation within the species. As to the amplitude
of this variation, nothing can be said until the opportunity arises of examining a more
extended series of animals than has been possible at the present.

It appears therefore that, for the purposes of description, fine subdivisions with
corresponding separate terms have not much to commend them, and that, without
reference to some definite standard, they are without any useful meaning. The term
mesodont for the standard, with the terms brachydont and hypsodont on each side of it,
are sufficient, and with them any two or more species can be referred to the standard or
to one another in a manner that will convey a definite meaning to another investigator.

Reference to the brachydont or hypsodont condition of a tooth implies the comparison
of two measurements. The terms are, in fact, names for two groups of height and
breadth ratios. As already stated, these measurements are usually made by eye and
regardless of any help that may be obtained by the use of instruments of precision.
If a numerical index be considered desirable it can be expressed as a ratio of height

* Except in the premolars of some species, e.g., R. blandfordi, which have the teeth of the anterior
region much compressed from front to back,

and breadth and an advantage of this method is that it gives definite expression to a
general impression obtained by the eye. When an attempt is made to deal with this
