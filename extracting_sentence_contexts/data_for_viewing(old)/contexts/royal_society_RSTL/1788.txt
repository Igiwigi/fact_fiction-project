accounts for the possibility of a suspended respiration, without the feeling of
oppression or pain, although sensation be unimpaired. Tt is, in a word, this
peculiar phenomenon, which, conjoined with the peculiar effect of sleep in in-
ducing diminished respiration in hybernating animals, constitutes the sns-
ceptibility and capability of taking on the hybernating state. On the other
hand, as the rapid circulation of a highly arterialized blood in the brain and
spinal marrow of birds probably conduces to their activity, the slow circu-
lation of a venous blood, doubtless contributes to the lethargy of the hyber-
nating animal.

6. Of the Digestion.

There is much difference in the powers of digestion, and in the fact of omit-
ting to take food, in the hybernation of different animals. The bat, being
insectivorous, would awake in vain ; no food could be found: the hedgehog
might obtain snails or worms, if the ground were not very hard from frost :
the dormouse would find less difficulty in meeting with grain and fruits, We
accordingly observe a remarkable difference in the habits of awaking from
their lethargy or hybernation, in these different animals.

I have observed no disposition to awake at all in the bat, except from ex-
ternal warmth or excitement. If the temperature be about 40? or 45®, the
hedgehog, on the other hand, awakes, after various intervals of two, three, or
