The short-time modulus for the last two sizes were determined to be given by
E39 =6.4GPa and Ego = 4.7 GPa. The smaller short-time elastic modulus for the 80m test size
is a reflection of a more compliant specimen which results in an earlier termination of the process
zone development. The role played by the short-time elastic modulus is significant, as revealed
by the fact that Ato aâ€œ Alpe x E39/Ego. The greater compliance for the 80 m test size is caused by a
slightly slower loading rate: Kgg = 0.17 kPa,/ms~! while K39 = 0.22 kPa/ms7!. The edge-notched-square-plates (ENSPs) tested at Resolute were tested in load or CMOD
control.
