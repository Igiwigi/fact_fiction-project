Globe race.

a pCO, oversaturation signal and a sharp increase from around 380 j,atm to > 410 patm. Zooming
into the high pCOz region in figure 6, the increase in the pCO, co-locates with the ship entering
the interfrontal zones, approaching the subantarctic front. Interestingly, this region is not co-
located with the largest change in the air-sea CO) flux (figure 5), likely linked to the fact that it is
among the best observed regions in the Southern Ocean [44,45]. However, as the neural network-
based mapping informs the global ocean within similar biogeochemical regions, the information
south of the Northern Boundary front will inform other, less well-observed regions south of
this front. Recently, many studies have argued for an integrated observing system that consists of many
different components [20,21], i.e. ships, Saildrones, Argo floats and moorings to optimally sample
the Southern Ocean.
