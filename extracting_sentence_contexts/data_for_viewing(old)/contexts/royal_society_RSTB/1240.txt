we may consider the second, viz., increase in size of the individual
m. This may involve any one or all of the dimensions* of the sporangium ;
ie sporogenous tissue might be extended («) in a radial direction, as regards

Smains more constant than the other dimensions of the sporangium, and the
rium is, with the exception of a few abnormal cases, defined by the first
wall. There is apparently a physiological explanation of the fact that the
‘of the sporogenous mass is almost uniform; the limit is probably imposed
