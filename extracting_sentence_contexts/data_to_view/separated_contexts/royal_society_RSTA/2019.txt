THE present communication has two objects. Its subject matter is an attempt to
obtain some knowledge of the series relations in the spectra of the group of the
monatomic rare gases Ne to RaEm, whilst the methods employed will serve to
illustrate the fundamental importance as instruments for further research of the new
facts brought to light in the previous communications.* The importance of the first
object will be generally acknowledged, but it does not yet seem to be realised how
definite and exact those new relationships are, even in their as yet undeveloped form,
and how powerful an instrument is placed in our hands for the analysis of spectra. It may be well therefore to commence by a brief réswmé of some of these laws as
applied in the succeeding pages.
