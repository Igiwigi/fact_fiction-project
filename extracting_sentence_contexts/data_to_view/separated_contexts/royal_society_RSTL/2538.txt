As an electric current acts by induction with equal energy at the moment
of its commencement as at the moment of its cessation (10. 26.), but in a contrary
direction, the reference of the effects under examination to an inductive action, would
lead to the conclusion that corresponding effects of an opposite nature must occur
in a long wire, a helix, or an electro-magnet, every time that contact is made with the
electromotor. These effects will tend to establish a resistance for the first moment
in the long conductor, producing a result equivalent to the reyerse of a shock or a
spark. Now it is very difficult to devise means fit for the recognition of such nega-
tive results ; but as it is probable that some positive effect is produced at the time,
if we knew what to expect, I think the few facts bearing upon this subject with which
I am acquainted are worth recording.

1102. The electro-magnet was arranged with an electrolyzing apparatus at a, as
before described (1084.), except that the intensity of the chemical action at the elec-
tromotor was increased until the electric current was just able to produce the feeblest
s8igns of decomposition whilst contact was continued at G and E (1079.) ; (the iodine
of course appearing against the end of the cross wire P;) the wire N was also sepa-
rated from A at r, 80 that contact there could be made or broken at pleasure. Under
these circumstances the following set of actions was repeated sevyeral times : contact
was broken at r, then broken at G, next made at r, and lastly renewed at G; thus
any current from N to P due to breaking of contact was avoided, but any additional
force to the current from P to N due to making contact could be observed.
