But
let the rays be $80 reflected that they shall pass by the body
without entering any more than one sphere of flexion; then
they will be separated by their flexibilities, as we before de-
scribed. It appears, then, that if the rays of light were not
differently reflexible, flexion could never produce the coloured
images, by separating the compound light. And, indeed, this
may be easily proved by fact. At 144 feet from the bending
body, the greatest fringes by flexion are only half an inch in
length, whereas the fourth or fifth images by reflexion are
above half an inch at one foot from the reflecting surface: the
one sort is therefore more than 144, times more distended than
the other, whereas the flexion could, at the very farthest, only
double them. Also the distinctness, and brightness, and re-
gularity of the colouring, are quite different in the two cases;
the supposed cause would neither account for the order of the
colours, nor for their absence in common.
