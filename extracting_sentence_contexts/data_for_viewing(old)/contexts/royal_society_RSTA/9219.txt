the smaller wave-number would be due to VD,, (—46) and the larger to VD,, (+40).

The maps bring out certain general peculiarities quite clearly. Amongst these may
be mentioned :—

(1) The majority of the strong lines are connected to the ¢ link either directly or
by an intermediary p link. More especially so in the case of Ag.

(2) The curious frequency with which, in a mesh involving the e link, a w or v
link is attached at one angle. In many cases we find » or v links attached
to an e link as if the whole of a mesh has not been observed.

(3) The fact that where a large number of links converge on a line, that line is
in general of small intensity—suggesting that the number of configurations
present emitting the frequency is small, because it is only slightly stable and
splits up into others related to it by the link relation.

(4) The large number of p links of normal value entering in the D linkages.


390 DR. W. M. HICKS: A CRITICAL STUDY OF SPECTRAL SERIES.

The evidence given in the preceding pages would seem to establish conclusively the
existence of these links and linkages in the spark spectra at least of Ag and Au. Of
740 lines in Au only 41 have no p, s, 1000, or 14838 links attached to them, whilst
