The only exception might be data-driven or resampling approaches that reuse parts of earlier
thrust time series. These are not considered here since they do not increase our understanding of
rotor loads. In fact, ideally we would like to obtain a model with only a few parameters that can be used to
generate realistic rotor load signals. The main use of such a model would be as a starting point for
a probabilistic analysis. One of the main challenges for structural optimization of wind turbine
support structures is the sheer amount of time-domain simulations needed for a comprehensive
assessment, which borders on the region of a few thousands [2,5].
