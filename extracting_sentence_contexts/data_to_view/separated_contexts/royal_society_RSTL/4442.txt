Now if thus intercalating the particle of phosphorus transfers the action from the
iodine to the phosphorus, s0 also intercalating a particle of oxygen might transfer the
action from the iodine to the oxygen itself, which would now be the truly oxidized
body, provided of course that the particle of oxygen thus intercalated were a body
which stood to the other particles with which it was in contact, in the same chemical
relation as the iodine and phosphorus in the other changes; nor do I see that this
substitution of the oxygen for the iodine is more truly extraordinary than the sub-
stitution of the iodine for the phosphorus. Indeed, if we inquire into the causes of
chemical change, the two would depend essentially upon one and the same fact,
namely, a chemical difference between the particles of the element. In the one case
we have the chemical diyision of the element, in the other the chemical synthesis to
explain: and to give a philosophical account of either fact we must assume alike the
existence of a chemical difference between its particles. Now, when we snbstitute
peroxide of barium for baryta in the iodine experiment, this very intercalation of the
oxygen has been effected, and the conditions of the change been fulfilled, the polar
cycle being completed, thus :—

In fact, when water is poured upon a mixture of peroxide of barium and iodine, a
violent evolution of gas occurs, and the same when chlorine is led into water con-
taining the peroxide, or when the peroxide is thrown into a solution of hypochlorite
of lime in acetic acid.
