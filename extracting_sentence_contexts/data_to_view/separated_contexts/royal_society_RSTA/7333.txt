However, as the differences between the two sets of experimental
-2 results are even-greater than the differences between either set and the theoretical results,
2 itis very difficult to decide what significance should be attached to this. Further laboratory
= work is clearly required. This is particularly important, as it would not be surprising if the
> elementary Coulomb approximation tended to become unsatisfactory for the heavier
= systems;t and it is desirable to know whether or not there is already a partial failure for K 1.
¢ Emphasis must be laid on the fact that for the transitions discussed the values of o? are
& extremely sensitive to the wave functions—either set of experimental results could be
8 reproduced by altering the values of n* derived from the term values by little over 1 part
in 100. There is little doubt, therefore, that, even for K1, the wave functions themselves are
5 remarkably accurate.§ In consequence the results given by the Coulomb approximation
© for transitions not subject to interference effects (such as 4s—4p, 5s—4p, 5s—5p, 6s—5p, etc.)
must certainly be reliable, no matter what the final conclusion regarding those for the other
transitions may be.

} The interference for the 4p—4d transition of K 1 is particularly severe, the representative point on the
(ni —n¥, nf)-plane lying within 0-00, of one of the zero lines.

¢ Due to influences other than from the purely electrostatic field of the core.

§ This suggests that Coulomb wave functions can probably be usefully employed in other problems. For
example, they are certainly satisfactory for calculating the mean square radii of outer orbitals (which are of
interest in connexion with the determination of the effective collision-broadening constant in stellar atmo-
spheres).
