higher percentage than that obtained by the same process in the same laboratory a year
previously.

It is needless to dwell with any emphasis on the obvious inference from all this,
namely, that the contagium is external to the infusions (that it is, 8omething in the air),
and that at different times we have different amounts of aerial interspace free from the
floating contagium.

d 25. Oritical Review of the last two Sections.

Tt has been my desire and aim throughout this inquiry to free it as much as possible
from uncertainty and doubt. I have tried to render the facts safe by laborious repetition,
and to render the interpretations of those facts secure by close and constant criticism.
Thus, in reference to our present snbject, T had to put to myself very definitely the
question whether the permanent clearness of an infusion exposed to a very moderate
amount of heat, after having been freed from air by boiling or by the Sprengel pump,
was really due to the destruction of the germs in the infusion. Even in a highly infec-
tive atmosphere from three to five minutes' boiling in an oil-bath suffices to sterilize our
retort-flasks, while it is perfectly certain that exposure to the boiling temperature for
fifty times this interval fails to kill the germs of an infusion containing a good supply
of atmosphericair. A similar remark applies to our experiments with the Sprengel pump.
I asked myself whether in these cases the life of the germs was not suspended merely,
instead of being destroyed. It was quite conceivable that germs endowed with vital
power, ready to act under proper conditions, might still exist in our hermetically sealed
flasks, although the entire absence of oxygen rendered their further development
