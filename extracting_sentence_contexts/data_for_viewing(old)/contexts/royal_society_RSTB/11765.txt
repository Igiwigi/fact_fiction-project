Access-related (e.g. GNW) theories attribute critical role
to frontal regions [52-56,57,94], while no-access accounts
typically advocate posteriorly localized NCC [86,95-98].
In this context, it has recently been claimed that studying
dreams could indirectly inform the access versus no-access
debate via locating the NCC more precisely than traditional
experimental paradigms do.

(a) No-report paradigms

In recent years, there has been a proliferation of research and
review papers arguing that previously reported frontal NCC
components are, in fact, not required for conscious experi-
encesâ€”they are rather only confounds that occur due to
some cognitive factors evoked by the specific task require-
ments of classical report-based paradigms where conscious
experiences are identified on the basis of subjective reports
(for reviews, see [31,38,99-103]; for criticism, see [85]).

The problem with classical report-based paradigms is that
they typically contrast two conditions that share the same
sensory input but differ in conscious experiences and result
in distinct reports. On the one hand, distinct reports inform
the experimenters that the subjects had distinct conscious
experiences; but on the other hand, the difference between
