The sun- or fire-dried leaves are smoked as
2 cigarettes. The leaf of the banana, or more rarely the leaf of a tree, is used as a
© wrapper. Hagen (1899, p. 245) believes that the people living in central New
© Guinea have introduced, together with the tobacco, the method of cultivation.
2 Van der Sande concludes, ‘from the fact that the people of the mountains actually
produce the best tobacco, this luxury has reached the coast population from the
‘ interior’ (1907, p. 15).
a Laufer (1931, p. 139) says: ‘Tobacco was known in New Guinea at least in the
beginning of the seventeenth century, for it is mentioned by Jacob Le Maire,
-3 who sailed along the coasts of the island in the year 1616 (Australian Navigations,
% ed. by De Villiers pp. 223, 226). On the 23rd of July of that year Le Maire,
2 when he was a short distance from the land, reports that he was followed by six
S big canoes of natives bringing dried fish, coconuts, bananas, tobacco, and small fruit
& like plums. The date in question is rather early and almost coincides with the first
= introduction of the tobacco plant or plants into Japan, China, Java, India and Persia
Le Maire’s notice, of course, is inconclusive as to whether the tobacco to which he
3 alludes was imported or indigenous.’

Nearly all the modern travellers to New Guinea who allude to tobacco smoking by
the natives state that this custom was practised before the coming of Europeans, but it is
evident that in all cases they refer solely to the arrival of Europeans into the-area with
which they are particularly concerned and not to the early Portuguese and Dutch
voyagers.
