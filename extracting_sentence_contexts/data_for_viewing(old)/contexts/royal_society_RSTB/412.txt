152 DR. C. E. BEEVOR AND MR. V. HORSLEY ON THE EXCITATION OF THE

3. The chief fact in this connection, and indeed possibly the most important new
point observed in this investigation, is the frequent limitation of movement to one
segment when a point is excited, instead of, as in the Bonnet, a sequence of move-
ments being thus produced. As an extreme instance of this singularity of function
we may mention square 31, where flexion of the elbow and nothing else was obtained.
The elbow in the Macacque, it will be remembered, was never unaccompanied by
movements of other segments and rarely initiated a ‘‘ March,” whereas in the Orang
we found it represented absolutely alone. (See “‘ Marches,” p. 144.)

It is well known that in the lower orders of animals the integration of representa-
tion becomes less perfect as we descend in the scale*—that, in fact, it is increasingly
difficult to differentiate the areas for the limbs; while, on the contrary, in ascending
the scale, we have shown in our previous communications that it is easy to differen
tiate between the areas of representation of even the segments of the limbs; and
finally, when we now arrive at the Orang, the segments are not only differentiated in
representation, but the nature of that representation is that of single movements.

There is now, from direct observation, reason to believe that in Man a similarly
‘interrupted mode of representation exists.

The excitability to faradie stimulation of the human brain was established by the
observations of BarrHotowt and ScraManna.}
