GJ. dichotoma stands aloof from most species of
Gleichenia ; Gl. flabellata, which has been the subject of observations to be detailed
below, holds a middle position as regards size and shape of the sporangium, though as
regards numbers of spores produced, it will be found to be an extreme type. With these facts before us we pass to the study of development. The sorus begins
to make its appearance in the still tightly circinate pinnule ; it arises as a smooth
outgrowth opposite a nerve (fig. 10), a considerable number of cells being involved in
its origin. Having grown to a height almost equal to the thickness of the pinnule,
it becomes flattened at the apex; in those cases where the sorus is to be a simple
rosette (figs. 11, 12), the convex margin begins to grow out as rounded processes,
which develope into the sporangia.
