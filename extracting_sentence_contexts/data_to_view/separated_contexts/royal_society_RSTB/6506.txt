The increase in size has taken place in two ways, by
cell division and by the conversion of fusiform initials to ray initials, and their addition
to the existing cell complex. Growth in height has been gradual, except in Fig. 19 (3),

by swelling and subsequent division of the apical initials, which push their way in
among the surrounding elements. This accounts for the fact that increase in height
is, for the most part, independent of the storeys. The exception to this is between
Figs. 19 (2) and (3), where one of the small rays is seen to have jumped a complete
storey by the addition of a whole converted fusiform initial. Fic. 19â€”Pterocymbium javanicum R.BR.
