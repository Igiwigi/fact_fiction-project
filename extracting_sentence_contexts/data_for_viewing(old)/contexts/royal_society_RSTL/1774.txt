of Physical Astronomy a greater degree of uniformity, by bringing to per-
fection a Theory of the Moon, founded on the integration of the equations
which are used in the planetary theory, it seems also no less important to
complete in the latter the method hitherto applied solely to the periodic in-
equalities. Hitherto those terms in the disturbing function which give rise to
the secular inequalities have been detached, and the stability of the system has
been inferred by means of the integration of certain equations, which are linear
when the higher powers of the eccentricities are neglected, and from consi-
derations founded on the variation of the elliptic constants.

The stability of the system may, I think, also be inferred from the expres-
sions which result at once from the direct integration of the differential equa-
tions. In fact, in order that the system may be stable, it is necessary that
none of the angles under the sign ine or cosine be imaginary, which terms
would then be converted into exponentials, and be subject to indefinite in-
crease. In the lunar theory, the arbitrary quantities being determined with
that view, according to the method here given, the angles which are intro-
duced may be reduced to the difference of the mean motions of the sun
and moon, their mean anomalies and the argument of the moon's latitude #.
