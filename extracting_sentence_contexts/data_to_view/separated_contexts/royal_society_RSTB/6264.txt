The functions, ascribed by Hix to these various glandular structures, may now
be tabulated for comparison with similar phenomena in the fowl. The albumen layer of the Monotreme egg is not so well developed as in the fowl
and it is interesting to note that its secretion is associated with the non-ciliated cells
of the lining epithelium of the upper non-glandular region. In view of the fact that
this layer has not been investigated chemically with the same precision as in avian
egg-white, an important point remains to be determined, as to whether the secretion
is a true albumen or a gluco-protein. If it is the latter, the secretory activity of the
ciliated epithelium would be closely comparable to that in the fowl. The glandular region is similar in function to the fowl isthmus and, though the
basal layer of the shell is not in the form of ovokeratin fibres, it is derived, as in the
