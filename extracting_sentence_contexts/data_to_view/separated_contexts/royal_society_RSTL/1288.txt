© any considerable-difference irr the number'of offspring of either
Sex.” I anv therefore disposed to! believe that: the sex of the
offspring is given by the female- parent; and the probability
of this' scems obvious in fishes;' and several other species'of
animals which breed in water; and though the evidence af-
forded by the facts adduced is not by any means of sufficient
weight to decide the question, it' probably much exceeds-all
that can be placed in the opposite'scale. In oviparous animals, I have: had reason tothink the influence
of the female parent quite-as' great, as'amongst the viviparous
tribes, though my observations/have been more limited, andless
conclusive: Inviviparous animals; the sizeof the foetus is affected
by the influence of the male parent, and, in'some'instances, not
inconsiderably; but the size and/form' of the'eggs of birds do
not appear to be' in any degree changed or modified, by the
influence'of the male;;-and therefore the size of the offspring,
at'the birth, must be regulated wholly by the-female-parent;
and this circumstance permanently affects" the: form and'cha-
racter'of the” offspring.
