and the solution (2.11) changes continuously into

viz., into the Family I of periodic solutions.

We are now in a position to investigate all the periodic solutions which exist for values
of f, g in the range under consideration. The solution obtained from (2.11) by giving

if f, g have such values that

where ”,, % are integers mutually prime, (2.11) gives a single infinity* of periodic solutions
all having the period 'l',. Moreover, the relation

is a continuous relation connecting f and g, so we may leave g arbitrary and determine f
in terms of g so that (2.14) are satisfied, T, being now a continuous function of g. Thus,
with g arbitrary and f so determined, (2.11) gives a continuous doubly-infinite family of
