That the small block between
these faults has been dropped down is shown by the position of the prominent band of
red tuff which occurs a few feet above the lake bed. The latter ends against the western
fault with a slight downward curve showing that here at least the movement of the
block between faults 3 and 4 was in a normal direction. Nevertheless, the curious fact
appears that the red bed is higher on the western side of the two faults than it is on the
east. This means that the east end of the fault block between faults 2 and 3 has been
elevated relative to the lavas east of fault 4. It follows that unless there is another fault
cutting the lavas east of fault 4 (and none was observed), the block between faults 2

and 3 must have been raised, for it is scarcely credible that so large a mass as that
which must lie between fault 4 and some unknown fracture east of fault 6, could have
been down-faulted while leaving such a comparatively small mass at a higher level.
