This spring,
which I shall call (A), I at one time conceived to be identical with the Source de la
Cascade of AxGLapa; I am now, however, persuaded that it is a different one, and was
perhaps never visited by him. From his description it clearly appears that his © Source
de la Cascade” was in the Gorge of Carensac, through which flows the Torrent Real,
near Thuez, and therefore considerably above the trifling ravine I have mentioned,
and which is distinctly marked nearly opposite Canavielles in the Departmental Map
of the Atlas National. This, in fact, is the distinctive mark of the spring (A) just
mentioned. It occurs in a small ravine very near the Tet, but at a considerable
height above it, a/most opposite to the copper mine of Canavielles, and within sight of
the Graus {Olette. It is on the right bank of the small torrent traversing the ravine,
and issues copiously from a cleft in a slaty granite rock.
