the oozooid of Botrylloides. The sequence and time intervals in Botryllus and even the
arrangement of the zooids at this stage, are so similar that it would not be possible
to determine which genus was being observed if it were not definitely known.
A single bud grows out from the right side of the oozooid and after growing very
slowly for about a week becomes completely developed in the next three days, the
oozooid being absorbed in the process. The first bud after several more days forms
and gives place to the second bud in much the same way, and so in turn the second
is replaced by the third. Only then is it found that the new bud can grow without
necessarily absorbing the previous bud generation, and the third and fourth buds
function together. There is very obviously a struggle for the available material.

As in the Perophoridae, the constituent zooids of a colony are united together by
the blood vessels of the test and have a circulation in common. In fact, the colony
in botryllids is more truly a super-organism than is that of any other sessile ascidian.

XIâ€”Discussion

Budding in ascidians has been the subject of many papers and of much
controversy. Outstanding are the early investigations of Hyorr (1896) and of
Pizon (1893), in later years of pz Srtys-LonccHamps, and the recent series by
Brien (1930). There should also be mentioned the theoretical discussion by
Garstanc (1928) in his paper on the morphology of the Tunicata. To a greater
or lesser extent two problems have dominated or influenced all such investigations,
namely, the significance of the germ layers and of the epicardium. Only in the
accounts of Brien do these questions become relatively unimportant and histogenesis
