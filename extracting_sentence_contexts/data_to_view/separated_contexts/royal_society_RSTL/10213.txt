In Cycas the
wings arise to external appearance in a manner not unlike those of Angiopteris, bub
there is between the two this important difference : that the periclinal divisions in the
superficial cells are entirely absent in Cycas. Thus again in the complexity of the
structure of the wing a progressive advance is seen on passing upwards through our
series of large-leaved plants, an advance from a simple structure to that more compli-
cated structure which is characteristic of the higher plants.*

In the above paragraphs a number of characters have been brought forward, showing
an almost uniform progress of complexity and differentiation of the vegetative organs,

* The case of the genus Todea should be mentioned as exceptional, while Todea barbara has wings
consisting of about nine layers of cells, Todea superba has wings with only one or two layers, it thus

from the Leptosporangiate Ferns, through the Osmundacee and Marattiacee to the
Cycadacee, and there is no apparent objection on other grounds to thinking that these
plants constitute a natural series ; in other words, that they indicate, at least roughly,
a line of natural descent. Tf this be 80 we are confronted by a remarkable fact. It
has been repeatedly insisted upon that the characters of the vegetative organs of
Angiopteris approach very closely to those of certain Cycadacewe. Yet between the two
there is all the difference in the reproductive organs between the characteristic free
prothallus and antherozoid of the Vascular Cryptogams, and the endosperm and pollen-
tube of the Gymnosperms.
