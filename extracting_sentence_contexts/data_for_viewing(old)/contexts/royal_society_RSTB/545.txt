production of milk is the most, but still very much less, nitrogen-exhausting ; whilst
if the grass be consumed by store or fattening animals, the loss is very much less still ;
indeed it is very small.

Obviously, however, it is more important to consider, what is the probable average
loss of nitrogen over a given area by the removal of crops generally, and not by that
of grass alone. Moreover, in making such an estimate it is not the total nitrogen of
the crops that has to be reckoned; but, taking into account the return by manure, only
the amount eventually lost to the soil. With the great variation according to cireum-
stances, it is of course very difficult to estimate this at all accurately ; but we may
state that two independent modes of estimate lead to the conclusion that, for Great
Britain for example, the average annual loss of nitrogen is more probably under than
over 20 lbs. per acre (= 22°4 kilog. per hectare). In fact, the loss by cropping, under
the usual conditions of more or less full periodical return by manure, is by no means
so great as is generally assumed in discussions of this subject.

The loss of nitrates by drainage may, however, in some cases be considerable.
There may also, under some circumstances, be loss from the soil by the evolution of
free nitrogen. Such loss may take place in the manure heap, or in soils very heavily
manured, as in market gardening, for example. But in ordinary agriculture such
excessive manuring seldom takes place; and the soil is generally much poorer in
nitrogen than in the cases of the experiments which have been quoted as showing
great loss from rich soils. Loss may also take place when the soil is deficiently
aérated ; but here again the conditions of the experiments cited, in which considerable
loss by evolution of free nitrogen was observed, are not the usual conditions of soils
