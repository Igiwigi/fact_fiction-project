Towards the chief astronomical end of the Expedition, there is yet a more interesting
zonclusion to be drawn. 'The days of highest radiation are those of least temperature,
md vice versd ; and this difference obtains in a signal degree on days when there was no
asible disturbing action of wind or clouds. What then causes the radiation of one day
0 be greater than that of another, and the temperature less? The immediate agent
zppears to be the atmospheric dust, which has already been spoken of in the Astrono-
mical Journal as 80 prejudicial a medium to telescopic vision, weakening direct light
and multiplying general light ; acting, in fact, by light precisely as the measnres 0
Sadiation and temperature prove that it does by heat.
2 Hence, then, we may easily understand why, with the dust strata rising to a very
2mited height, say 11,000 feet, the small difference of altitude between Alta Vista anc
ara produced as great an increase in the radiation as did the great difference, nearly
Jour times as great, between Guajara and Orotava. Hence also we are furnished with
3 very portable apparatus for ascertaining on a high and distant mountain the principal
Dements that produce a good astronomical site.

2 (2.) Radiation by Actinometer.

= In the accurate determination of solar radiation for physical inquiries, the black-bulb
'Inust yield to Sir Joux Herscnnr's actinometer. That, in principle, has been stated by
Ju able judge to be perfect; but the instruments themselves, as furnished by the best
Maker in 1856, according to our 'Teneriffe experiences, have not arrived at equal practical
Ferfection.
