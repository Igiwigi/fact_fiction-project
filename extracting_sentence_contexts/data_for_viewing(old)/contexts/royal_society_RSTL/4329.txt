s the wettest month in 1848 was February, which yielded 30-55 inches, by far the largest
S quantity ever measured in any month in this country ; and the two wettest days
& were the 3rd and 26th of December, when 4:60 and 422 inches respectively, were
read off.

At Seathwaite, there have been forty-eight days in last year wherein the quantity
of rain fallen was between half an inch and 1 inch; thirty-two days between 1 and
2 inches ; thirteen days between 2 and 3 inches ; five days between 3 and 4 inches ; and
two days between 4 and 5 inches.

In a former paper which I had the honour to lay before the Royal Society, I
endeayoured to give a general outline of the meteorology of the Lake District, as far
as the facts then ascertained would permit. I now proceed to discuss one or two
points which were intentionally passed over in that report.

The mountains flanking the Lake District yalleys, generally increase in altitude

with great regularity, towards the head or eastern extremity of the vale; and it is
here that the greatest depth of rain is invariably found. The difference in the annual
quantity between places contiguous to each other and in the same valley, is often
remarkably great. The amount increases rapidly as we recede from the ea, and
towards the head of the valley the incremental ratio is enormous.
