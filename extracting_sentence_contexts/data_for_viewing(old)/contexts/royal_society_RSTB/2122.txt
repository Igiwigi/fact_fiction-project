occur. The changes in volume observed by Kraus* (and which may, as It have
shown, be especially well studied in the fruit of Cucurbita) are good evidence of
turgescence-effects depending on normal amounts of psychometric changes in the air.
GopLewski} has shown that moist air produces a remarkable temporary acceleration
of growth, while dry air has the opposite effect.

The experiments which have been given in §7, on the effect of the dry air of a
laboratory in closing the stomata, seem to me conclusive evidence that the stomata
ean shut under conditions which do not produce any change in the outward aspect of
the plant. This being so there is no reason why the same thing should not occur in
wild plants. Unfortunately, this is a question to which I have paid little attention.
In the summer of 1896 I did, however, notice a number of instances in which the
hygroscope gave either zero or a very low reading, and I connected the fact with the
prolonged drought of the season. Until further observations of the sort can be
made we must rely on experimental evidence and on horticultural experience. Some
interesting questions arise as to the mode of action of the guard cells in dry air.
Can we look at guard cells as sense-organs which, when the leaf is threatened by
want of water, perceive the coming danger before the rest of the leaf? This idea is
not wholly fanciful ; Sranf has given some reason to believe that the transpiration
of the guard cells is especially active ; in dry air, or with a diminished water-supply,
they should therefore be the first to suffer. It is conceivable that they might in this
way act as “ tell-tales”—just as fusible metals are used on the construction of
automatic fire-doors.

These considerations are suggested by an experiment of Sraut’s.||_ Two Tropaolum
