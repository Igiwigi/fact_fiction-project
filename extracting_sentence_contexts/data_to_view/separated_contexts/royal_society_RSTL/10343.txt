From this point of view
the comparative details hereafter given as to yarious members of the same genus which
Q exhibit opposite tendencies, especially Poa pratensis and Poa trivialis, and the different
= gpecies of Arena, which nevertheless manifest very opposite tendencies, may profitably
Z be studied,
SZ This opposite tendency between nearly allied plants (further illustrated by the
S occasional impossibility of grafting, or of mutually fertilising, allied species), is a most,
SD interesling phenomenon, and of great importance from both a scientific and a practical
S point of view. Several illustrations of it will appear further on ; meanwhile we may,
b= in passing, allude to the necessity for caution in the interpretation of isolated experi-
=] ments which this fact demonstrates. Because 9 particular grass, or other plant, is
2 little benefited by ammonia-salts, for instance, it does not follow that it will not be
S favoured by nitrates ; nor, because if while growing in association with other Species it
= may not be specially benefited by a particular manure, does it follow that it would not
2 derive advantage from the same substance when growing separately,
£ The alleged antagonism of certain plants has been supposed to be dne to the
X injurious effects of root-excretions ;* but this supposition is, to 8ay the least, not
S a sufficient explanation of the observed phenomena.
