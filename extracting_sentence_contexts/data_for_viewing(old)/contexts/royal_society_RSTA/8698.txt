Hence the possibility contemplated may occur if, say,

K275.

The direction in which the scattered wave vanishes will be given by

(5°32) $ = 42, cos @ = A,/C, = 2F (x,a)/{3—F («,a)},

the final formula being simplified by remembering that K is large.

I am not aware that there is any experimental evidence showing traces of this phenomenon ; in fact all
the evidence shows that ¢ = 0, = 47 is not far from the truth. Thus the circumstances in actual
experiments cannot have been such as to introduce the reversal of magnitude between A, and C,.

(ii.) Second Approximations.

We proceed next to find second approximations, assuming that | K| is not large ;
it will be necessary to retain the second terms in the series (3°4) and (8°6) for 8, and
E,, but the first terms will suffice for 8, and E,.t It is easy to see that then terms
of order («a)® occur in the coefficients A,, C, and A,, but that no other coefficients can
contain terms of order lower than (xa).

Using now the series (34) for S, (z) we have
