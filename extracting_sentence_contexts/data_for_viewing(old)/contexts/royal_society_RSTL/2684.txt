A. Geological Position.—The springs of Bagneres de Luchon issue from granite
very near its junction with clay slate. This portion of granite is not marked in
CHaneENTIER'S map, though it forms part of a regular band crossing the valley at and
above Bagneres de Luchon, and is, I have every reason to belieye, connected to the
eastward with the granite of the valley U'Aran in Spain, and to the westward pro-
bably with that of Oo. Its mineralogical character is generally less crystalline than
that of Oo; but I am confirmed in my opinion of its identity by having found near
the Lac d'Espingo granite i situ, containing beautiful arborescent mica, similar to
the mica palmier found in granite masses near Luchon, and which have every ap-
pearance of belonging to its immediate vicinity.

B. Specialties of the Springs.—It is a curious fact that all the chief springs of
Bagndres de Luchon issue from the granite within a few feet of one another, although
their properties are believed to differ considerably, and their temperatures certainly
do. They are kept separate by partitions connected with a vertical wall, into which
slabs of stone (which may be removed) are cemented. The springs are called La
Reine, La Grotte Sup6rieure, La Source aux Yeux, La Blanche, and La Froide ; but
all of these, excepting the two first, are apt to mix with one another; and I even
learned that such a mixture was practised in order to give a greater apparent supply
to some of the more esteemed of the springs. It is quite certain too that rain water
mixes with some of these, which with other facts immediately to be noticed, render
observyations of temperature here of little avail. My obseryations were made on the
Springs as they flowed from beneath the wall just mentioned. These springs are
highly sulphureous, and the two whose temperature T measured were copious.
