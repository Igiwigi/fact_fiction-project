same $eason of the year, and in the summer, that the sap of
trees chiefly passes up in the vicinity of their medulla,
through their heart wood.

M. Covuroms's statements are, I entertain no doubt, per-
fectly correct ; but the inferences which he, and other conti.
nental naturalists have drawn from the facts which he has
stated, are, I suspect, erroneous, For I have stated in a
former communication, that when I intersected the alburnum
of an oak tree in winter, no symptoms of life appeared above
such intersection in the ensuing spring. A similar experi-
ment being repeated in the end of June, appeared instantly to
intercept the whole of the ascending current, and the leaves
of a tree, of: which the heart wood remained entire, faded
more rapidly than rhose of another tree of the same species,
which was felled at the same period, and lay: upon the
ground. In the spring of 1816 also, upon the 1st of March,
the season of M. CouLoms's experiments, I intersected the
alburnum of a poplar tree, 1000 parts of which I have stated
