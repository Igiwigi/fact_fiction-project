Obviously, the well-nourished “rosy yeast” has developed into a true hyphal
fungus, with septate filaments and conidia, and the next step is to see what it is most
like: clearly it is not like any yeast known to us, and we must look for its allies
among some of the higher forms. For my own part, I cannot help being struck with
the general resemblance between my figs. m-—g, and some of the conidial forms of the
Basidiomycetes lately described by Brereip*, and although several links are required
before this form can be definitely allied with the Basidiomycetes, it seems probable
that the common “rosy yeast” is a mere growth form of some member of that
group. Yeast D. (Plate 15, fig. 10.)

In some of the earlier separation cultures, I frequently met with a small yeast, the
cells of which were very nearly spherical, and averaged about 2°3 to 3°7 » in diameter,
and appeared in remarkably dense, white, dusty looking films on the top of the
culture liquids: these films were so like flour in appearance that I habitually
referred to this form in my notes as the “ floury yeast.”

I have made no very extended cultures of it in detail, because, as stated on p. 138,
I found that it was not a normal constituent of the Ginger-beer plant; but one or
two interesting facts about it came to light during the examination of the pure
cultures, and those may be put forward in the hopes that further investigations may
