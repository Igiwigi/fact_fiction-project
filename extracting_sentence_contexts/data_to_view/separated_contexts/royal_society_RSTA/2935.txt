The retarded and advanced Green’s functions are
defined by

GRex, x’, t,t) = —i0(t — F)({W 00, W(x’)}) (2.2)
and
A(x, x, ¢) =i0(t — H({2 00), T(x’). (2.3)
They follow equations
[E — Hog |GRO) (x, x’, E) = 5(x — x’) (2.4)
and
GRA) (x, x’, E)[E — Alx)] = 5(x — x). (25)

The operator £=E — FI acts on Green’s function from the left side in equation (2.4), while it
goes from the right side in equation (2.5). Thus, GRA) (x, x’, E) is generally composed by W(x) =


Yn CnYn(x) and (x') =X, din n(x’) with

Ga 4x6"). (2.6)
W(x) and n(x’) satisfy
L(x) u(x) =0 (2.7)
and
Oy (x L(x’) = 0, (2.8)

where the index m (n) is the quantum number and cy and dm are coefficients that will be
determined in the framework of McMillan’s theory. We can take the transpose on both sides of
equation (2.8)

LOX) Pn(x’) =0, (2.9)
To find the proper form of L(x')", we should use the fact Kye = ke yz, where key z is a real
space operator kee yz = —idy yz’. For example, if we have a 2 by 2 Hamiltonian
Ax) = So hilke ky, ke6i, (2.10)
i
where 6;=9,1,2,3 is Pauli matrix, AT (x’) is then expressed by
AT (x) =O hi(—ky, ky, ke). (2.11)
i
For convenience, we define a ‘new’ operator H as
A(x) =Al (x), (2.12)

As seen from the 2 by 2 example of equation (2.11), one can find the general relation that the wave
function ® of H(x) and the wave function W of H!(x) have one-to-one correspondence

ce sky (E) = We kk (E) (2.13)

or
Pk ky ke (E) = Pp, 4, -K.(E), (2.14)

where ky ky, kz are quantum numbers. And we know that the Hilbert spaces spanned by the
eigenfunctions of Hand H have one-to-one correspondence.
