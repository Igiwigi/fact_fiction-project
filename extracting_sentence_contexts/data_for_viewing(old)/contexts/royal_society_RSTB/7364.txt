With regard to the first explanation, it is thought that the retinal receptors, which are
responsible for arousing the three primary sensations, are stimulated to some extent by
rays from all parts of the spectrum. Thus, the green receptors not only react to rays near
the middle of the spectrum, but also slightly to red rays and blue-violet rays as well. In
consequence, a mixture of red rays and green rays, which causes a sensation of yellow light,
also causes a sensation of blue at the same time. Since the latter is complementary to
yellow, the result is that the yellow appears to be diluted with white. Yellow rays, on the
other hand, which stimulate the red and the green receptors, affect the blue receptors
hardly at all, so that these rays appear to possess a greater degree of purity than a mixture
of red rays and green rays.

Another way of stating these same facts is, ‘that the primary sensations are situated at
points which lie outside the colour triangle’. It should be pointed out that this hypothesis
concerning the three hypothetical sensations has not been proved experimentally.

With regard to the central inhibition hypothesis: Géthlin (1943), having surveyed the work
of other observers in the matter of these negative values, advances the hypothesis that they
are due to central, that is, cerebral, inhibitions, which of necessity accompany the impulses
to the complementary colour. ‘Every impulse from the retinal receptors to a colour
