The differences within the family are slight and concern for the most part rate
of budding, length of stolons, etc., which while virtually without significance do
have a very marked influence on the appearance of the colony as a whole and on
the size of its constituent zooids.

Of the species examined Polyandrocarpa tincta forms colonies of four or five zooids
so close that their outer walls are in close contact. Apart from the faculty for
budding, the zooids are almost indistinguishable from the solitary individuals of the
genus Polycarpa. In Distomus variolosus and Stolonica socialis budding is more rapid,
with the result that the colonies are composed of smaller but much more numerous
zooids. In Symplegma viride the zooids are smaller and more numerous again, and
apart from the fact that each zooid has an atrial siphon opening independently to
the exterior, they resemble closely colonies of Boéryllus or Botrylloides. The zooids of
the last two genera have atrial apertures opening into common cloacal cavities instead
of independently to the exterior, and the zooids in consequence become arranged in
systems.
