Q(v)= min film [ioe + 0-8, —O-G P+ np + 0 bod
geH'(D) JD r

Remark 3.2. A particular choice of test function we use often below is
6
g=rd, \(v-&) =f v-6@,(r,0') —v- @(r) do’.
0
It sets the first integral in Q to zero, giving the bound

Q(v) < f |ar(r8g '(v - 6) +v- 8g |? dx.


Proof. We need the fact that

[ivaty-ve= min [imave= min [ites (3.4)
D meL?(D) /D geH(D) JD
V-m=0

for any ve L?(D). A quick proof of it goes as follows: let ¢ € Hj(D) satisfy A¢ = V - v in D, and
note that V¢é is L?-orthogonal to divergence-free m, including V¢ — v. Hence,

fimsve= [ im+v—ver+ [ vers [iver= [ivatv-we
D D D D D

and equality holds for m= V¢é — v. This proves the first part of (3.4), and the rest of it follows
