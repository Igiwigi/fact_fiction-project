WOODS ON STUDIES OF THE

instance, by means of dilute caustic soda, there is again a loss of crystalline orientation—
this time in the x-photograph—when the super-contracted length falls markedly short
of the original unstretched length, and once more the loss of orientation is quite in-
sufficient to account quantitatively for the observed contraction. Moreover, the
«-photograph does not pass over into still another new form; except for loss of orienta-
tion, it preserves its identity. These two facts, the maintenance of the «-photograph
during super-contraction and the non-quantitative loss of orientation, thus afford
additional strong evidence that the complete elastic mechanism of hair consists of parts
which lie both in series and in parallel. Whether the fibre is in a state of super-
contraction or of “ set,” it still retains its elasticity wholly or in part.*

Perhaps the most striking demonstration of simultaneous super-contraction and set
in different parts of the same fibre is shown by the following experiment. Cotswold
wool was stretched to 50% extension, treated at this extension with water at about
60° (. for half an hour, allowed to contract to its original length in the same hot water,
and then photographed by X-rays; as expected, the photograph was in the o-form.
