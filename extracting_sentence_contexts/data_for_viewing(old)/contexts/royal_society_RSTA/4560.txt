stronger finding than result 2.1, since not all mean-preserving increases in variance are also an [3
MPS. Also note that result 2.4 does not require the independence of T and g;. :

Focusing on the mean climate sensitivity alone then could once again lead us astray. Consider |
the implications of result 2.4 in the context of the discrete distribution functions for climate >
sensitivity given in the previous subsection. Keeping all other values the same, we can reduce the :s8
most likely value of f2 from 3.3214°C to 3.25°C to produce f;. The density function f; represents [os
an unambiguous improvement over fy. The mean of f3 is less than f,: 3.08°C compared with :3
3.12°C. Yet, as (02 - o?) - (ui - Ww) = 0.125 > 0, we would still prefer to confront f, rather than [8
f3. The WTP has gone up, even though the new distribution has a lower mean value of climate :3
sensitivity, more mass in the left-hand tail, and the same amount of mass in the right-hand tail. [8
That is because outcomes got worse in the middle. What at first glance might have appeared to
be ‘good’ news is, in fact, ‘bad’ news. This result holds if we change the most likely value of f3 to
any value higher than 3.2155°C, while leaving all other values unchanged, when 13 = 3.06°C.

(ii) Non-logarithmic utility

For non-logarithmic utility—values of y 4 1—the impact on the social planner’s WTP of moving
from f; to f; is more complex. This is because no natural damage function combines with
non-logarithmic utility to give a quadratic value function. We are, therefore, no longer in the
comfortable world of mean-variance decision-making, where result 2.4 holds. However, we
conjecture that if both (i) f; and f; belong to the same major traditional families of distributions
and (ii) T and g; are independent, then a mean-preserving increase in variance will generally
increase the social planner’s WTP.®
