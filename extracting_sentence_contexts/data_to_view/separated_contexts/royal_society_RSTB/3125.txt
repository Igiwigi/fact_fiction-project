Suleus retrocentralis nferior.—This is a tri-radiate suleus subdividing the inferior
parietal lobule. Its posterior extremity coincides with the posterior end of the
fissure of Sylvius by reason of an early fusion of the superior temporal and supra-
marginal gyri. Sulcus subcentralis posterior,—This is present as a short unbranched sulcus, cutting
the upper margin of the Sylvian fissure,

Sulcus Sylvii.itn general the fissure of Sylvius does not at first sight appear
abnormal, but, as a matter of fact, it is notably shortened posteriorly by the
annectation just mentioned.

(a) Ramus horizontalis anterior,—This arises by a common stem with the ramus
ascendens, and is a short cleft separating the frontal operculum from the orbital
lobe.

(b) Ramus anterior ascendens.—This, the formerly termed anterior limb of the
fissure, is also short, and runs vertically upwards, parallel to and only 8 mm.
separated from the sulcus preecentralis inferior.

(c) Ramus posterior ascendens et descendens.—This important part of the fissure
barely occupies 40 (39°3) per cent. of the total length of the hemisphere owing to
the degree ot gyrus development of the inferior parietal and occipito-temporal
region. VOL, CC.—B, R


122 SIR VICTOR HORSLEY: DESCRIPTION OF
On separating its lips the relations of the insula are seen to be normal, as follows :

Lobus insularis (Ret). Sulcus circularis vel limitans insula. (a) Pars fronto-parietalis.—This part of
the sulcus is deep, and is not joined by the secondary sulei of the insula (vide infra).

(b) Pars frontalis—The frontal part of the suleus bordering the insula lies at the
bottom of the stem of the suleus Sylvii, and is itself short but deep.

(c) Pars temporalis.—The temporal part of the circular sulcus presents the normal
gradual widening anteriorly with the sharp bend inwards.
