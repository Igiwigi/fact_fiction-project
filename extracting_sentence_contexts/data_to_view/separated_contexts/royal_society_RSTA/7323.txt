For this reason some compromise between ‘fin’ and ‘spin’ stability may be
unavoidable.

+ The assumption is made here that the jet malalinement is not appreciably affected by rotation; no
information is available on this point. Some of the tolerances connected with the gas flow produce deviations
which increase with the spin, so that the dispersion associated with irregularities in the gas flow cannot be

reduced indefinitely by increasing the spin. It is, in fact, possible that for certain projectiles rotation may
have no beneficial effect upon this dispersion. OF THE MOTION OF ROTATED AND UNROTATED ROCKETS 569

In the preceding sections the mathematical theory of the motion of a rocket has been
worked out in detail.
