is found to have been restored.

(9) Calculation of the true length of the final coiled chromosome at both meiotic
divisions shows them to be in reality closely similar in spite of the difference in number
of coils, but both are shorter than the somatic chromosomes by amounts which vary

from 33 to 50°%, according to the method of estimation. In all cases the calculated
length is roughly equivalent to the visible length of the chromosome at strepsitene.

II. From these facts it is postulated that the molecular structure of the chromosome
must in some way resemble that of other highly elastic fibres, notably the proteins
keratin and myosin. The observed changes of length are commensurate with those
produced in keratin and myosin by changes in molecular shape from the « to the # and
subsequently to the supercontracted state. On this view the temporary straightening
of a molecular convolution is postulated as a possible causal factor in chromosome
pairing. Elastic recovery from this exceptional state is regarded as the cause of the
cessation of pairing, and the subsequent shortening is interpreted as supercontraction
in the same sense as in the fibrous proteins mentioned above.
