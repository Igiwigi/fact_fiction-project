Note that both the denominator and the numerator are symmetric polynomials in the roots of F.
Hence, they are homogeneous polynomials! (over F) in the coefficients of F of degree 2n — 2.

It is perhaps not trivial that they are indeed polynomials, rather than rational functions with a power of a, in their
denominators. We will see that they are indeed polynomials as a by-product of their computation. Furthermore, in all of
our applications, F will be monic.


Furthermore, the denominator is in fact the discriminant of F, for, in characteristic 2, r + e =
(r,- ry. Following Berlekamp, we denote the numerator of Berl(F) by &(F), that is,

&(F)
disc F’

Berl(F) = (2.3)

Note also that, in characteristic 2, disc F = 5(F)*, where
