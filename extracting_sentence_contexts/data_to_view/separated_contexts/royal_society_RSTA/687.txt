(d) Temperature-pressure relations affecting the refractivity and density of gases. A direct
consequence of the close proportionality between refractivity and density in the case of
gases, even at moderately high densities, is that variations of refractivity with tem-
perature and pressure should closely correspond with those of density under the same
influences. In fact, the departures of gases from the well-known laws of a perfect gas
may very well be investigated by refractivity measurements, as will be indicated later
in this paper. 6 H. BARRELL AND J. E. SEARS ON THE REFRACTION AND It is of interest to compare the results of previous experimental work on the changes
of refractivity and density of air under the influence of temperature and pressure
variations.
