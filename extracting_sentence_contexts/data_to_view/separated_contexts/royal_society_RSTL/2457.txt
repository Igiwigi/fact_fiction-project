In the experiments detailed by this
philosopher the interyening septum is supposed to contribute materially to the phe-
nomena. In the experiments with gases the intervening membrane does not prevent,
but it does not contribute to, the change. But independent of this, the existence of
this power in gases was not known to DuTrocner until after the fact had been fully
ascertained by others. Mr. Darrox many years ago proved that hydrogen possessed
the power of penetrating or mixing with carbonic acid in opposition to gravity ; that
oxygen possesses the same property, but in a higher degree, I ascertained in the
island of St. Thomas in 1827. TI afterwards made experiments on a larger scale, in
1830, at the high rock of Saratoga, where there is an atmosphere of natural carbonic
acid; and the result was communicated to many physicians in America previously
to any of the American publications on the snbject.
