The latter sup-
position would accord with the recent highly interesting ex-
periments of Mr. BapBaGe. I am not aware that such effects
as these have ever before been observed during vibration,
and there certainly appears great difficulty in assigning any
cause for them : however, until further observations may
have thrown greater light on the subject, we must be satis-
fied with having ascertained the facts. I have not as yet made any observations to ascertain what
may be the effects when a needle vibrates exposed to the


influence in the $olar rays. 239

Separated rays, but having an apparatus for the purpose, I
propose doing s0 when the season becomes more favourable
for such experiments than it is at present. Royal Military Academy,
