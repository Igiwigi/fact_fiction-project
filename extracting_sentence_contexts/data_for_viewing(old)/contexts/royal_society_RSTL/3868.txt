these functions are restricted separately to the two structures, as I first imagined, the
one to the upper and the other to the inferior series, or whether they are administered
to conjointly by both, through an interchange of fibres, it is almost impossible to de-
termine by any decisive experiment on these animals, although the struetures them-
selves are distinct. But in the absence of experimental proof there are cireumstances
connected with the distribution of the nerves to the extremities which seem to indi-
cate, that these low forms of Articulata are endowed with a power of sensation and
feeling far beyond what has of late been adjudged to them by some physiologists.
In some of the gigantic Sprostrepti and Spiroboli the legs are adapted for climbing
up the trunks and branches of trees, by the under surface of the first and second
basilar joints of the tarsi being developed into a soft cushion or pad, as in some in-
sects; and to these parts of the limbs I have found the nervous fibres more extensively
distributed than to any other; a fact most strictly analogous to that of the distribu-
tion of neryes in the tactile parts of the limbs of Vertebrata.

Those fibres of the cord which seem to be independent of the sets just described,
and which do not appear to have any direct communication with the great seat of
sensation and volition—the brain,—are of two kinds, which may justly be regarded as
involuntary in their functions. The first of these are the commissural fibres (figs. 4. 5.
7. g) which pass through the ganglia; and the second are those which have hitherto
been undescribed, and form the sides of the cord (f) in the interspace between the
ganglia, or between certain nerves distributed from them—the fibres of reinforcement
of the cord.

The fibres of reinforcement of the cord form the lateral portions of the whole
