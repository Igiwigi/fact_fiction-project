Eve OBSERVATIONS. The accuracy of these observations has been found to depend, to a very large
extent, upon experience on the part of the observer in dealing with the relative
intensity of the lights placed side by side. It is, of course, a familiar fact in
photometry that it is very difficult to form a judgment as to the equality of two
illuminated surfaces when the illumination is either very feeble or very powerful ;
and accordingly this is a source of considerable inaccuracy in such determinations. It is not desirable in either case to examine the relative intensity attentively for any
length of time, as it is obviously possible, by viewing two feebly illuminated surfaces
side by side for a sufficiently long time, to imagine that they are almost equal when
really they are not so, and this remark appears to be particularly applicable to such
cases in which the two colours are of slightly different tints. Instances have arisen
in which it has been impossible to arrive at any result whatever as to the relative
intensity.
