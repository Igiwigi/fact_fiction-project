chemical senses of smell and taste were the first to develop when life began, and
even simple single-celled organisms are able to detect chemicals around them
and react accordingly. Such signals may indicate an opportunity, such as a food
source, or danger, such as poison. Therefore, a good sense of smell will be an evol-
utionary advantage for any organism. Some 200000 years ago, our early human
ancestors will have used their sense of smell to hunt, to differentiate nutritious
from spoiled food, and to flee fire and predators. Nowadays, modern human
beings increasingly rely on vision, with the result that we are losing active olfactory
genes at a greater rate than all other primates [1,2]. It is interesting to speculate
whether vestiges of the evolutionary development of our sense of smell can be
ascertained today. The fact that a newborn baby uses smell to turn towards its
motherâ€™s breast suggests that there is an inbuilt genetic coding for chemical detec-
tion [3]. On the other hand, the sense of smell is strongly linked to the neurobiology
of memory, suggesting past personal experience is also an important factor in smell
perception [4]. Finally, in the instant of smelling, our olfactory system reacts rapidly,
desensitizing us to strong or persistent odours so as to retain detection capability
[5]. The sense of smell is undoubtedly complex, and not yet fully understood.
