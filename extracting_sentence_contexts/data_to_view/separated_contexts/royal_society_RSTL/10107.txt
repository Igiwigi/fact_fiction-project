probability nearly or quite attained to the mature form. This larva differs from the
other two forms in the possession of small claws at the tips of the last three pairs of
pereiopods, and as this is characteristic of MiLxe-Epwarps' genus Acetes, and only
three genera of Sergestidze—Lucifer, Acetes, and Sergestes—have been described, T
think we may conclude that we have to do with the development of an American
species of this genus. Ab any rate, whatever the systematic position of the adult may
be, the fact that the Protozoza is in most respects intermediate between the simple
Protozoa of Lucifer and the extremely modified Protozota of Sergestes, gives this form
80 much interest that it seemed best, for the sake of comparison, to embody all that
