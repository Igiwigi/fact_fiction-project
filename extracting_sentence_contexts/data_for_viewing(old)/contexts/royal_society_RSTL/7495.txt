52. That this increase of electric force in the electro-magnet is the consequence or
effect of a certain number of electrical waves transmitted through the electro-helices, and
succeeding each other with sufficient rapidity to snstain the increasing flux of magnetism
in the iron, is manifest from the time which elapses before the electricity transmitted
through the helices attains a permanent degree of intensity, and before the electro-
magnet acquires its greatest amount of magnetism (45) *,

53. That the length of time which was observed to elapse, and the number of waves
which required to be transmitted through the electro-helices before the current from the
magneto-electric machine attained a permanent degree of intensity, and the electro-
magnet acquired its greatest amount of magnetism, are dependent upon the magnitude
of the waves of electricity transmitted through the electro-helices, is evident from the
fact that the same degree of intensity of the current (as measured by the balance), and
the same amount of magnetism in the electro-magnet, were obtained with a much
smaller number of waves, and in a shorter time, from a large electromotor, than could
be obtained with a much greater number of waves from a small electromotor (46).
These observations will be further confirmed by experiments to be hereafter adduced.

94. The cause of the great difference between the attractive force of a permanent
magnet and that of an electro-magnet excited through its agency, and also the agreement
of the phenomena with the principle of the conservation of force, now become sufficiently
manifest to render it unnecessary, at the present time, to institute a more rigorous com-
parison between the quantities of magnetism and electricity of the magneto-electric
machine, and the quantities of the same forces developed in the electro-magnets (23, 33).
The general conclusion which may, however, be drawn from a consideration of the Pre-
