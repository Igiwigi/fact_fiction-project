On stopping the oxygen Cheyne-Stokes breathing
returned.”

The greater tendency to periodic breathing after an exertion was probably due to
a temporary fatigue of the lung epithelium, and consequent lowering of arterial
oxygen pressure. After an exertion the alveolar oxygen pressure was usually rather
high for some time, so that a lowering of this could not have been the cause. Closely connected with periodic breathing is the fact that any temporary holding
of the breath caused hyperpnoea immediately. This was very evident during the
first days on Pike’s Peak, and caused us a good deal of inconvenience in such opera-
tions as reading gas burettes, shaving, &c. At ordinary barometric pressures one is
accustomed to hold the breath during various short exertions, and to make it
synchronise with other exertions, such as that of walking.
