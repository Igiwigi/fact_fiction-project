The flow of gas into the pressure regulator could be roughly adjusted by
means of the tap, and more finely -by means of the clip. It was impossible to get rid
of all the air in the CO,, but I found that, after a large quantity of gas had been taken
from a bottle, the remaining gas was practically pure, the percentage of air falling
from about 0°6 per cent. in the case of a full bottle to about 0°01 per cent. in the case
of a bottle which was nearly empty. Unfortunately I had used a large quantity of
the gas before I discovered this fact, but I was able, however, to calibrate the fine
tubes with pure CO, taken from bottles which were nearly empty, and in the later
calorimetric experiments I adopted the following device. Two bottles, A and B, were
arranged so as to be able to supply gas in parallel. The automatic pressure reducer
was fixed to the tube joining the bottles.
