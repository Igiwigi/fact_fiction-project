In the northern part of Norway it increases from the 12th, vanishes on the 20th, and
exists but irregularly afterwards.

The evidence of these 8tatements is 8een most clearly by an inspection of the curves
of which I have spoken ; and the eye catches from these the course of the facts far
more distinctly than from any numbers. But it is not necessary to publish all these
curves, and I have therefore only annexed a specimen in Plate XXVIL. and, for the
rest, stated the results of them in numbers in Table XI. The means there given are
obtained by a graphical interpolation, 8uch as I have already described, and the
other columns exhibit the effects which are mainly due to the diurnal inequality.

26. In these tables the differences of heights are arranged according as the tide oc-
Ccurs A.M. or P.M. But it will be seen at once that this is not, in fact, the circumstance
on which the distinction depends; for at most of the places the p.y. tides are greatest
till about the 12th, then the a.v. tides are the greatest till the 18th, and afterwards
the e.. tides are again the highest. Hence we see that it is impossible to give the
law of this inequality, as is sometimes attempted, by saying that at one season of the
year the A.M. tides are greatest, and at another season the p.m. tides are greatest. 'The
real rule, on the coast of America, is, that the tide which follows the superior transit
of the moon when she has south declination, and the inferior transit when she has
north declination, is the greatest. And hence we see that the s8ign of this inequality
in the tables must change when we come to the half-day without a tide in each semi-
lunation, as it will be seen, by inspecting the tables, that it does : for if the tide
which happens at 11» 50 a.m. today be the one which follows a superior transit, the
tide which happens at 0 20» p.,v. tomorrow will also follow a superior transit ; and
