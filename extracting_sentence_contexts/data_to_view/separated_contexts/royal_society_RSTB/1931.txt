5, including the apex of the sporophyte. â€˜The most striking
feature of the section is the definite though irregular line of demarcation between
the cells of the process and the tissue of the sporophyte. The contrast depends
mainly on the fact that the sporophyte tissue consists of small cells of meristematic
appearance, while the cells of the prothallus have large vacuoles and thicker walls,
which stain deeply with Bismarck brown. Occupying the apex an initial cell of the
usual form is seen, and the succession of cell walls shows that segmentation proceeds

as in the apex of a fern stem. In a central position and separated from the
