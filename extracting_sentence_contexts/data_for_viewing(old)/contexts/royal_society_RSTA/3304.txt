extensively studied over the years, making them by far the best characterized carbon clusters [1,2].

As first observed by Wollaston [46] and Swan [47], Cy is responsible for the blue
glow emanating from hydrocarbon flames. These well-known d? Tg-a° ITy Swan bands (the
spectroscopic notation employed throughout is the updated one [48]) at 19380.1 cm~! have long
been recognized in cometary spectra [49]. Despite previous knowledge of the Phillips (A'Ty-
x! ze ) and Mulliken (D! 5 ¢-X1 ze ) bands involving singlet states [50], the prominence of the
Swan emission/absorption features in the laboratory and astrophysical sources led to consider
a? ITy as the ground state of C2. This changed with Ballik & Ramsay [50] during investigations
of the bode -a3 [Ty system (so-called Ballik-Ramsay band). They observed perturbations in the
rotational levels of the 3EE state which were attributed to the presence of a neighbouring singlet
state. From the analysis of the spectral lines, the authors first confirmed that ors is the ground
state of the carbon dimer. In fact, it lies only 603.8 cm7! below the a3/7, state [48]. Later on, several
other singlet, triplet, quintet and intercombination band systems of the carbon dimer have been
reported in the literature [1,2,48,51]. At present, Cy has a total of 23 identified band systems,
covering the spectral range 0-55000cm7!, and 21 spectroscopically characterized electronic
states; see [1,2,48,51] for a review. Guided by this well-known and rich rovibronic line list, the
identification Cz was made possible in a plethora of astrophysical sources, including carbon stars,
comets, interstellar medium and the sun [1,2,48]. Such a wealth of spectroscopic information has
been recently used [48] to obtain highly accurate partition functions and thermodynamic data of
