C. V. BOYS ON THE RADIO-MICROMETER,

Owing to the fact that, with increase in the breadth of the circuit, the cross piece
becomes increasingly mischievous, both on account of its moment of inertia and of its
resistance, it is clear that the circuit cannot be too narrow until the increased length
becomes such that it is inconvenient to provide a magnet and pole pieces which will
enclose so great a length. In another way the thick wire which the narrow circuit
requires is advantageous, as will appear shortly. Having thus found the best relations between the variable copper and the arbitrary
junction and mirror, it remains to see how these may be modified with advantage.
