ACTION OF SULPHURIC ACID UPON THE AMIDES AND NITRILES. 463

It is evident that this was nothing but the disulphometholate of silver, but M. Mer-
s8ENs does not appear to have investigated the snbject further, or to have connected
the appearance of this salt with the evolution of carbonic acid gas, which he likewise
found among the secondary products of the action of snIphnric acid upon acetic acid.

The chemical character of disnIphometholic acid is 80 marked, and the reaction
which produces it so simple and definite, that there could be no doubt regarding the
existence of numerous corresponding terms in homologous and even in analogous
series of substances. In fact disulphometholic acid may be considered as the type of
a very numerous class of bodies of similar composition, some of which are actually
known, while a great many remain to be discovered.

We have ourselves traced the formation of the homologues and analogues of disul-
phometholic acid in several higher series of bodies, but we have been satisfied in esta-
blishing the existence of these substances, without entering into a detailed study of
their properties.
