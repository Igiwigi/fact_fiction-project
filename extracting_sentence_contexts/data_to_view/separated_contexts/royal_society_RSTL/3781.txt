The
four equations just mentioned are identical with those obtained by the method of the
variation of parameters for determining the eccentricities and longitudes of the
apses. It is worthy of remark, that in both methods the changes of the eccentricities
and of the longitudes of the apses which are due to the disturbances; are taken into
account in calculating the changes themselyes, so that the approximation does in

two elements. If the approximation be made to include generally the 8quare of the disturbing

for that purpose, terms may arise containing coefficients which bave 2 for a factor.
