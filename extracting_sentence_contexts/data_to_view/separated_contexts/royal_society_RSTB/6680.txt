In the first group the
reaction is remarkably uniform and is accompanied by a considerable amount of
rather superficial necrotic destruction of tissue. When A? was the partner of any of the
three tobacco strains the reaction was somewhat less severe than that produced by any
of the others not excluding XÂ¥ (see fig. 40). This fact affords further evidence for the
substantive nature of this strain. In appearance the reaction consists of the well-known
mottle of pale and dark green areas common to simple tobacco mosaic infection, but
on the pale areas are superimposed lightly necrotic rings. When the aucuba strain is
present the plants later exhibit brighter yellow areas which distinguish them from
plants infected with mixtures in which the two other tobacco mosaic strains are present. -
The leaves are narrower, reduced in size, the surface slightly rugose and the contour
irregular, but the actual destruction of tissue does not involve the whole thickness of
the leaf.
