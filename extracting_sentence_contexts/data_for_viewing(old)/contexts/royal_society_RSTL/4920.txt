'= mass of vesicles, which vary in size; they are chiefly circular, and their contents
ransparent. They consist of an external, homogeneous and transparent membrane,
_ a closed cavity, which contains a mass of nuclei. In some cases, however,
Sthe vesicles, instead of being filled with nuclei, are lined with a layer of nucleated
cells, and a cavity, although small, exists in their interior.
= It may be seen, from the preceding observations, that the thyroid glands are deye-
Aoped in the form of two distinct separate masses of blastema, one at each side of the
=root of the neck, close to the point of separation of the carotid and subclavian
gvessels, and between the trachea and the bronchial clefts, but quite independent, as
Star as regards their evolution, of either of those parts. Their minute structure also,
Sat an early period of their deyelopment, closely corresponds both with the spleen and
ESupra-renal glands ; and the tissues of which they are composed, at a later period, are
Aformed in a manner precisely similar with the same parts in those organs, a fact which
$hows the analogy they bear to one another.

From the preceding observyations, it will be seen that a close analogy exists between
the glands already described; and the propriety of their classification, together with
the thymus, under one group, as the © Ductless Glands,” may be considered clearly
proved. Now although most anatomists, excepting Mr. Goops1r in this country,
adopt such a classification, and place the spleen under the head of the © ductless
glands,” many of our continental anatomists, among whom may be enumerated EcktR,
in a very late and highly elaborate article, has attempted to prove that this organ
cannot, either anatomically or physiologically, be enumerated with them. © For,”
Says EckeR, © though the vesicles of the spleen have a similar function with the glands
