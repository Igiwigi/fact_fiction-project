SYNGE ON THE TIGHTNESS OF THE TEETH. When we substitute this in (101), we obtain the three equations

df dR
re (Red )= a ee (103)
Re ee) — 3 12nv H+ 1220, (2+ RB), eee. ON)
ra (Rae He) — Fos — 19 wi? — 1200, (2% + Re), oe dos}

The boundary conditions for the functions f, g,, g, are

FO=P, HOM=0 gO) =O, =O, gM=O0,.. . (106)

the last two arising from the fact that p must be single valued at the apex. From (103) we obtain

reg sino Se Pe eae (107)
where C is a constant of integration. Hence
pp = bun |” Rh- tdo +O) R a ro (108)

where C’ is another constant of integration.
