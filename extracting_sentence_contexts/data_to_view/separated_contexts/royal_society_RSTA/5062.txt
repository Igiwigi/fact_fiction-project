One of the issues associated with the use of passive
devices for wind turbine structural control is that they may become ineffective as a result
of environmental /operational changes or in the presence of parametric variations. The use of
traditional passive tuned mass dampers (TMDs) in wind turbines also needs careful design. In
fact, if the primary structure is very large (e.g. a wind turbine blade), the TMD will inevitably
have a small mass ratio. As a consequence, accurate tuning of the natural frequency of the damper
to the natural frequency of the primary structure may become difficult, and small deviations
from the optimal tuning may result in poor control performance. Further, tuning of the damper to
the rotational frequency of the turbine (which is generally associated with harmonic components
that mainly dominate the blade response) is not feasible, as it will lead to instabilities in the
TMD-blade coupled system [14].
