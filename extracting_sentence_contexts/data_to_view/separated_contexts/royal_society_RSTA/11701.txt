We habitually use the instrument in a room of fairly constant
temperature, and the method of illumination cannot be charged with giving rise to
the variations ; for the lamp may be turned up so as to radiate, say, a hundredfold
as much energy without producing any increased effect. The only radiation reaching
the interior from the lamp is that which can pass through the fine scale divisions, and
this ull impinges on the surface of the mirror. The fact that the instrument is
practically air-tight, precludes the theory that external currents of air cause the
effect. Besides, there is the mill-board box coated with tin-foil, and outside that the
iron and mill-board box. It remains to consider variations in external magnetic force, and it is to these
variations that we attribute the fluctuations observed.
