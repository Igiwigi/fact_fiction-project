The numbers which
I have quoted from one of my own experiments for comparison give an emissivity
for polished platinum, with the vacuum of July 1 and 2, 1886, much higher than
that found by Scuterermacuer. This may be due partly to difference in the polish
of the surfaces, as I find that a very slight difference in this respect produces a very
great effect. It may be, also, that the vacuum at which the determinations of
ScHLEIERMACHER were made was of a higher order than mine of July 1 and 2, though
I do not think this probable.* I think, however, it is most likely that the true
explanation of the greater part, at least, of the difference lies in the fact that
ScHLEreRMACHER surrounded the wire with a glass envelope. It is impossible to
estimate with a non-diathermanous and badly conducting substance like glass how
much heat may be returned to the wire from the polished walls of the tube ; and it

found, with the exception of those given by Macrartanr, a few given by Piorgr, and one or two by
Kunpr and Warpoure, expressed in units of heat or units of energy emitted, under definite circumstances,
per square centimetre per second.

* Son.ererMacner used the Brsset-Hacen pump, My experience of this pump does not lead me to
feel confidence in it as being capable of producing a very high vacuum. My reasons for this statement
were given to the British Association, September, 1886, in a paper ‘‘ On an Improved Mercury Pump.”

was to avoid these uncertainties that I was led to abandon the far more manageable

(for these experiments) glass envelope, and to take in its place a copper envelope

blackened on the inside.
