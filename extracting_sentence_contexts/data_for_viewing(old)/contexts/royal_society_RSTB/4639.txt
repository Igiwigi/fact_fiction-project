Although, owing to the difficulty of feeding the worms, it has not been possible, up
to the present, to show by direct experiment that an anterior regeneration continues
to form new segments until the original segments occupy exactly the same position in
the regenerated worm that they did in the original worm, and that when this position
is reached no further segments are formed in front of the original ones, nevertheless
a study of regenerated specimens, collected from material brought in from the natural
habitat or from material which had been living for a time (up to about a month) in
small glass aquaria in the laboratory, leaves little doubt that such complete and exact
regeneration does actually occur. Thus a piece of an original worm, consisting of the
twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-fifth, and twenty-sixth segments will regenerate
a new head and twenty-two anterior segments. It will also regenerate a number of
posterior segments, but the exact number here is not of such interest or importance,
owing to the fact that growth in these worms continues to take place with the forma-
tion of new segments in the zone of growth immediately in front of the pygidium.

It is especially by a study of the way in which regenerated specimens fragment
that evidence is obtained of the correctness of this view. But before studying the
breaking-up of worms with an anterior regeneration it will be useful to show from
particular instances that posterior regenerations from original anterior ends break up
normally, according to the position which they occupy, so that the whole regenerated
worm falls into the usual regular scheme, which was explained on p, 141 and illustrated
in fig. 18, Plate 14.

The following instances show quite normal breakage, or have only unimportant
irregularities towards the tail :â€”
