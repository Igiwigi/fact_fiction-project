we know that vegetable acids consist of oxygene, hydrogene,
and carbon, we are not really acquainted with their compo-
sItion, because these are not their proximate, that is, are not
their elements, but are the elements of their elements, or the
elements of these. It is evident what would be our acquaint-
ance with sulphate of iron ; Å¿or example, did we only know
that a crystal of it consisted of iron, sulphur, oxygene, and

pound of lime, carbon or diamond, and oxygene. | In fact,
totally dissimilar substances may have-the/same ultimate ele-

nitrate of ammonia, and hydrate of ammonia, or crystals of
caustic volatile-alkali,* both ultimately consist of oxygene,
hydrogene, and azote.

It is not probable that the present ore is a direct quadruple
combination of the three metals and sulphur, that these, in
their simple states, are its immediate component parts ; it is
much more credible that it is a combination of the three sul-
phurets of these metals. |
