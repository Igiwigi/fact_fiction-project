These conclusions, both in regard to the general
law and its qualification, have been since confirmed by continental physicists, and espe-
cially by the late rigorous experiments of WULLNER®. In the same paper we ventured also on the generalization that * eyery liquid has a
specific refractive energy composed of the specific refractive energies of its component
elements, modified by the manner of combination.” Later research has confirmed this
also, extending it to conditions of matter other than liquid, and showing more clearly
when 8uch modifications occur, and what is their nature. Professor LanDoLT, of Bonn,
has greatly advanced our knowledge of the subject, and has simplified the calculations
by adopting what he terms the refraction-equiyalent, that is, the specific refractive energy

multiplied by the atomic weight, or PEE, Recent investigations in fact tend to the

general conclusion that the refraction-equiyalent, not only of mixtures, but of every com-
pound body, is the 8um of the refraction-equivalents of the elements that compose it. Were this perfectly true, like the statement * the atomic weight of a compound is
the sum of the atomic weights of its constituents,” it would be a simple matter to deter-
mine the refraction-equiyalents of all the elements; and then we should be in a posi-
tion to calculate the effect of eyery transparent body of known compoxition on the rays
of light transmitted by it. But it is not absolutely true: even in Laxporn's first
paper it is evident that there are exceptions; the unknown cause which modifies the
refraction of mixtures probably acts in cases of more perfect chemical combination ;
and the conviction has grown that some elements have two or more refraction-equi-
yalents.
