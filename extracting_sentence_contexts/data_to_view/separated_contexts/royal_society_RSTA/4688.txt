By contrast, one usually only has two transverse polarizations of
electromagnetic waves (and even scalar quantities in thermodynamics). The elastic equations
are not even form-invariant in the static case [40]. Intuitively, this is related to the fact that
one can describe a homogeneous isotropic conductor by a simple scalar conductivity (figure 2). Likewise, a single scalar material parameter is sufficient for electrostatics, magnetostatics, static

diffusion, or static heat conduction as well. By contrast, one needs a rank-4 elasticity tensor, CG to
describe a homogeneous isotropic elastic solid.
