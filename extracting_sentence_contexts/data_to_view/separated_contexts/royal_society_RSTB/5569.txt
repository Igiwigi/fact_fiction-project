There is no need for the larve to rise from the bottom currents, it is of no consequence
that dispersion is approximately halved through the elimination of the active phase,
and there is literally no opportunity for selection of habitat on the part of a tadpole,
should such a form exist. Therefore among sand-living species there is no reason why those with anural develop-
ment should not survive as readily as those with urodele. In fact, the type of dispersion
occurring among such forms, %.e., more nearly confined to the bottom currents, and
extensive but not too extensive, should be definitely advantageous. The history of
the family Molgulide may accordingly be visualised as follows :â€”

The primitive Molgulids were inhabitants of extensive, submerged sand-flats. They
had a spherical or ellipsoid body of average size 25 mm., with test processes
for attachment to sand grains.
