caustic consisting of a closed C! curve bounding a strictly convex region inside 2.

Remark 3.3.

(i) Observe that every convex caustic has a well-defined rotation number. In fact, the
dynamics tangent to it induces a circle homeomorphism from the boundary to itself; the
rotation number of the caustic corresponds to the Poincaré rotation number of this circle
homeomorphism.

(ii) One could wonder about the relation between caustics for the billiard in 2 and invariant io
curves for the corresponding billiard map Bg. One can show that a C! convex caustic in 2 :
corresponds to a homotopically non-trivial invariant curve for the billiard map; however, =
the converse is not entirely true. In fact, homotopically non-trivial invariant curves of Bg a
(which are graphs by Birkhoff’s theorem) do give rise to caustics, but these caustics need a
neither be convex nor differentiable.

Remark 3.4. The notion of caustics is often connected to the so-called whispering gallery, a Ww
phenomenon that can be detected under some particular domes, in which whispers can be clearly :
transmitted and received from distant parts of the gallery. 73

A natural question that one could ask is whether the existence of caustics is a common or a iis
rare phenomenon. As we have seen before, circular and elliptic billiards possess many caustics.

Question. Are there other Birkhoff billiards with caustics? And in the case of an affirmative answer:
How many caustics is it reasonable to expect?
