microscope, the interior was seen to be filled with secondary cells. Each of these,
formed by a distinct envelope, appeared to contain other, or tertiary cells, and strongly
reminded me of the developmental cells of the spermatozoa in the male organs, since
these again seemed to contain granules, or quaternary cells. In the midst of the
secondary cells I was able to distinguish, in the centre of the germinal vesicle, in s0ome
specimens, one or two cells of larger size than the rest, and which I regarded as the
remains of the germinal spot, or central nucleus. In those ova which, from their size
and general appearance, seemed to be the most mature, the peripheral series of cells
within the germinal vesicle were of smaller diameter than those nearer to the centre,
as if the earlier developed secondary cells had disappeared and liberated their con-
tents. The cells of the dark portion of the yelk that adhered to the germinal vesicle
were also nucleated, but were of much smaller size than the peripheral cells of this
body. I must remark, however, that saving the fact noticed, of having seen in s0me
yesicles one or two cells near the centre of larger size than the rest, I bave not been

able to distinguish any separate nucleus, or germinal spot, which seems, at this time,
to have disappeared as a distinet body. The germinal vesicle thus near its matutity
is a mother-cell that contains a multitude of daughter or secondary cells, each, appa-
rently, including its own progeny.

It is thus certain that the germinal vesicle exists in the ovum of the Frog until after
