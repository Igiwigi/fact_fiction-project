For the mechanical characterization (§4), we manufactured several specimens of the
composite by stacking several 20 x 20 mm graphene-coated RR pads and curing them in a
manually operated hydraulic laboratory hot press. The coated RR pads were confined in a
purpose-built steel mould during curing. Control specimens were also manufactured using
uncoated RR pads. To facilitate data comparability, all the specimens were manufactured at the
same temperature, pressure and duration of the curing period. After curing, the specimens have
a final thickness of 15 mm. Adherence among layers has been assessed qualitatively by visually
inspecting coated and uncoated specimens cut in half after curing, with curing temperature and
time have been adjusted to ensure layer bonding. Adherence has also been confirmed through
the deformed shape of the specimen during the shear test as shown in figure 10. In this test,
since the composite is layered parallel to the plates’ direction, one would expect the layers to
slide with respect to each other in the absence of bonding, thus, the fact that the specimens
deform as a solid block implies layer bonding.

The tested specimens for the mechanical characterization are summarized in table 2. Specimens
E35-E36 were made with four pad 3 type; a patterned mask was used to deposit graphene
nanoplatelets covering 16% of the surface area. Specimens E39-E40 were made with four pad 2 type
and 40% coated area; an additional layer, uncoated not pre-heated was positioned on top with a
thickness of about 1.5mm to match the height of the other specimens (compensating the unevenness
