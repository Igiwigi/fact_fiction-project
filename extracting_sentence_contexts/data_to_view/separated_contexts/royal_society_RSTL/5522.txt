Now, although this expression appears to contain two arbitrary constants, it will be
shown presently, that when 7 is an integer and not greater than 7, it really contains only
one. This is seen immediately to be the case when #=0, and may be easily verified in
other simple cases, such as 4=1, n=2, &c.

9. In fact, the process of art. 2 gives

U,=Til =O co OD Ty m4 ms

where ,_,, satisfies the equation
(w,_u7_, wy +(1—mY—P)n,-u= 0;
and in general we can only arrive at an integrable form by taking m==n.
