450 MR. A. FOWLER ON THE SPECTRUM OF MAGNESIUM HYDRIDE. 1880, these observers stated that “if it (the line 5210 at the head of the green
fluting) be not due to a compound of magnesium with hydrogen, at any rate it
occurs with special facility in the presence of hydrogen, and ought to occur in the
sun if the temperature were not too high. We have been careful to ascribe this
line and its attendant series to a mixture of magnesium and hydrogen rather than
to a chemical compound, because this expresses the facts, and we have not yet
obtained any independent evidence of the existence of any chemical compound of
these elements.” Further important evidence was obtained later by Liveine and Dewar from a
series of observations of the magnesium spark, without jar, in hydrogen at pressures
above that of the atmosphere. *
