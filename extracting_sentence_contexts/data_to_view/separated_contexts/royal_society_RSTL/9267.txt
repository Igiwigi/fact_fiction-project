It is further to be noticed, both with respect to the foregoing comparison of the
theoretical with the experimental results, and also with respect of such further com-
parisons as will be made, that the reasoning admits of being reversed ; and instead of
deducing the experimental results from the equation, it might have been shown that a
similar equation is the necesxary outcome of the experimental results. Indeed, this
has been already done, and it is only out of regard to the length of this paper that I
refrain from including the inverse reasoning.
