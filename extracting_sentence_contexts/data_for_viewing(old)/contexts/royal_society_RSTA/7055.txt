The whole network is derived from any one of the triangles (the fundamental region)
by the various operations of the group. Mobius illustrated this fact by means of his poly-
hedral kaleidoscope, consisting of three mirrors forming a trihedron whose dihedral angles

are 1/2, 7/p, 7/q. It is most convenient in practice to use mirrors cut into the shape of circular
sectors of appropriate angles ¢, y, y (Coxeter 1948, pp. 24, 293). A small object, repre-
senting a point, placed within the trihedron, yields g ‘images’ (strictly, the object itself
and g—1 images). When the object is placed on one of the mirrors, the images coincide
in pairs, leaving only }g points. The number is further reduced when the object is on an
edge where two mirrors meet. In fact, as we shall soon see, the images are then the vertices of

according as the angle at the edge is 7/q or 7/p or 7/2.
This kaleidoscopic construction for polyhedra is appropriately ascribed to Wythoff
(1918) because it was he who first successfully exploited it (in four dimensions).

3. WyTHOFF’s CONSTRUCTION

In terms of the spherical triangle (which the three mirrors of the polyhedral kaleidoscope
cut out from a sphere drawn round their common point), we are considering the images
