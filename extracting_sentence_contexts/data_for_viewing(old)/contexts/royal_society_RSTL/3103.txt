state, are divisible into these elementary moveable halves.

1348. Electrolytic discharge depends, of necessity, upon the non-condaction of the
dielectric as a whole, and there are two steps oracts in the process : first a polarization
of the molecules of the substance, and then a lowering of the forces by the separation,
advance in opposite directions, and recombination of the elements of the molecules,
they being, as it were, the halves of the originally polarized conductors or particles.

1349. These views of the decompoxition of electrolytes and the consequent effect
of discharge, which, as to the particular case, are the same with those of GRoTTauss
(481.) and Davy (482.), though they differ from those of Bior (487.), Ds La Rivg
(490.), and others, seem to me to be fully in accordance not merely with the theory
I have given of induction generally (1165.), but with all the known facts of common
induction, conduction, and electrolytic discharge ; and in that respect help to con-
firm, in my mind, the truth of the theory set forth. The new mode of discharge
which electrolyzation presents must surely be an evidence of the action of contiguous
particles; and as this appears to depend directly upon a previous inductive state,
which is the same with common induction, it greatly strengthens the argument which
refers induction in all cases to an action of contiguous particles also (1295, &c.).

1350. As an illustration of the condition of the polarized particles in a dielectric
under induction, I may describe an experiment. Put into a glass vessel some clear
rectified oil of turpentine, and introduce two wires passing through glass tubes where
they are at the surface of the fluid, and terminating either in balls or points. Cut
some very clean dry white silk into small particles, and put these also into the liquid;
