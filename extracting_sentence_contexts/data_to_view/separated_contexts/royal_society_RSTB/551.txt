Indeed loss would seem to
be a perfectly natural result; and it is obvious that, neither from the combined
nitrogen of the atmosphere, or that due to accidental sources, nor from free nitrogen,
either directly or indirectly, did these reputed nitrogen-collectors gain nitrogen enough
to compensate the losses from the rich soil. It is, indeed, recorded gains that require
confirmation, with very careful methods of experimenting, before they can be accepted
as conclusive evidence of the fixation of free nitrogen, and not as due merely to
accidental sources of combined nitrogen, or to other experimental errors almost
inevitable in experiments in which the soils and the plants are not enclosed, but

exposed to the free air. In conclusion, all the results of Dr. Drerzei, excepting the one in which he found
a gain, seem quite accordant with well established facts. On the other hand, if free
nitrogen is really fixed in the soil under the influence of microbes, it certainly might
be supposed that the result would be developed in a soil so rich in organic matter,
and doubtless, therefore, in micro-organisms also, as a garden soil containing 0°415 per
cent. of nitrogen ; and especially might it be supposed that it would be developed in
