understood before these can serve as a guide, which is demonstrated by the fact

1at history is full of misinterpretations and misconceptions of itself (cf. [48,49]).
Rather than aliens invading Earth, most likely detection scenarios will involve
microbial organisms and/or extra-terrestrial life at a safe distance that prevents
yhysical contact. As far as exploring other life forms is concerned, any strategy
applied must exclude biological contamination—not only to protect ourselves,
yut also to preserve any alien life discovered as part of an overall commitment
o enhancing the richness and the diversity of life in the Universe [16]. For such
scenarios with well-contained risks, the dominant human response is unlikely to
de one of fear and pandemonium [48]. Human perceptions and representations of
alien life will not only derive from science, but, given that humanity is more than
just a collection of logic and facts, they will be highly influenced by cultural and
y»sychological factors. Therefore, reactions will not necessarily be homogeneous,
and reality may defy common myths [49]. It is believed by some that establishing

1e presence of extra-terrestrial life as a fact will cause a crisis for certain
religious faiths. A survey, however, shows that followers of all the main religious
denominations as well as atheists declare that it will not be a problem for their
own beliefs [50].

While scientists are obliged to assess benefits and risks that relate to their
research, the political responsibility for decisions arising following the detection
of extra-terrestrial life cannot and should not rest with them. Any such decision
