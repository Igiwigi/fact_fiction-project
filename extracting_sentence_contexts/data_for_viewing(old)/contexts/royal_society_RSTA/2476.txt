parallel to the y direction and holds the cell phone in his right hand. When the user stands in P31,
the received signal is mainly dominated by the LOS component from luminaire 1. On the other
hand, there is no LOS signal in P;,3 and the received signal mainly depends on reflected signals.

In figure 22, we illustrate the spatial distribution of channel gain as seen by the individual
photodetectors Dn, n=1, ... ,7. It is observed that as the user moves within the room, the spatial
distributions of channel gain seen by photodetectors D1, ... , D6 follow the sinusoidal pattern in
x and y directions. When the user approaches to a luminaire, the signal strength increases. The
maximum signal strength (i.e. maximum value of channel gain) occurs when the user is right
under the luminaire. When the user walks away, the signal strength decreases. On the other hand,
the spatial distribution of channel gain seen by photodetector D7 is almost flat (i.e. the same
channel gain for all cells). This is a result of the fact that this detector is oriented towards the floor
and the detector only captures reflected rays, i.e. there is not LOS component.

Table 9 presents the average channel gains and RMS delay spreads (i.e. averaged over 100 cells
in the room) for D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, Dé and D7. It is observed from table 9 that the best location of
photodetector (i.e. minimum path loss) is D5. It can also be noted that D1, D2, D3, D4, D5 and D6
have similar channel gain values in the range of 6 x 10~°-7.19 x 10~°. In comparison to them, D7
has about 2.95 x 10~°-4.41 x 10~® less channel gain on average since there is no LOS component.

In figure 23, we present the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of path loss as seen by
the individual photodetectors Dn, n=1, ... ,7. This defines the probability that path loss will
