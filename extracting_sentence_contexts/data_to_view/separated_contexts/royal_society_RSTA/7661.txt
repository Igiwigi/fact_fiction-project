Watson’s original paper should be consulted for the full explanation of these terms. The difficulty of the analysis lies in the fact that this determination of the zeroes requires
an intimate knowledge of the intricate Bessel and Hankel functions involved. In a paper by one of the writers (Eckersley 1931-2) it was shown that Watson’s
solution was essentially equivalent to an eigenfunction solution, appropriate to wave
problems of this type. Thus the eigenfunctions are the residues of the integrals discussed
above, and the proper values are the discrete values of s which make the expression for
(s) zero.
