| that of the nerve in character, but owing to the difficulty of keeping the root protected,
| and at the same time insulated, the amount of the effect, and, presumably, the
| L excitability of the root, declined, especially in one Cat (341); the results, thereforg
' are all modified by the fact, that ds the “ minimal” stimulus was applied first, the
) deflection caused by the excitatory electrical root change is much larger in the case of
the “minimal” stimulus relatively to that of the “maximal” stimulus than would
otherwise be the case. The following table gives the results of the galvanometric observations; each
deflection being produced by electrical changes in the nerve root, corresponding to the
Q localised excitation, for five seconds, with the interrupted induction current of the
* sectional area of a special tract of the cord as indicated below.

It is seen that with the minimal stimulus an effect is practically only evoked by
excitation of the posterior column of the satne side as the root ; with a stimulus of
greater intensity an effect is also obtained with stimulation of the posterior column of
the opposite side, this being one-fourth the amount of that evoked by stimulation of
the column of the same side, As regards the lateral columns, only once was any effect
in the root obtained, and that was with stimulation of the column of the same side.
