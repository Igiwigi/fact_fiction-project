Professor O. W. Ricarpson (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ A, 343, 1903) has given a very simple
and elegant theory of the negative leak from hot bodies. According to this theory
the metal contains electrons which move about freely inside the metal and have a
velocity distribution like the molecules of a gas. Those electrons which collide with
the surface with a normal velocity greater than a certain value escape. This theory
leads to the formula « = Aé‘e-®”’, and according to it A is proportional to the number
of free electrons per cubic centimetre in the metal. According to this theory A ought
to be nearly independent of the pressure and nature of the gas present, because the
electrical conductivity of the metal is very little affected, even by hydrogen.

In my previous paper I showed that hydrogen changed the value of A by a very
large factor, and therefore I suggested that Ricrarpson’s theory required moditication
in order to enable it to account for the facts.

Tt is shown in Section 1 of the present paper that if the true values of Q and A are
denoted by R and D, and if we suppose that R and D may be functions of the
temperature @ as well as of the pressure, then the variations of Q and A can be
explained either by supposing that D is constant and R a function of @ and p, or that
