The VTA projects to both the mesocortical and
mesolimbic pathways, which in turn enables cognitive and
emotional processes to influence behaviours tied to motivation
and addiction [6,21]. The DA neurons in the VTA have been
found to contain high levels of OXTR in mice, perhaps explain-
ing why OT acting in the VTA promotes social behaviours
and influences the saliency of social stimuli [22]. In fact,
infusion of OT into the VTA causes DA to be released in down-
stream brain regions such as the nucleus accumbens and the
medial prefrontal cortex [17,18]. The DA hypothesis of autism [2] suggests that the
behavioural deficits seen in ASD arise from a dysfunction of
midbrain dopaminergic systems, such as those of the
mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways. Along with the multi-
tude of rodent studies implicating the involvement of OT to
activate DA in these pathways [17,18,22-25], human studies
using fMRI and plasma extractions have offered additional
confirmation [5,26].
