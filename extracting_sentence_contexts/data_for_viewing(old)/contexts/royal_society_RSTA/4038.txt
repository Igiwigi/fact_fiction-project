redundant, although over a few decades the fact that the event could be recorded simultaneously
from widely separate sites was to assist in resolving some of the remaining puzzles. The most
obvious contribution was the revelation that the solar corona revealed during an eclipse was
actually a core feature of the Sun and not, as many had thought, an atmospheric distortion during
observation or part of the Moonâ€™s atmosphere.

In 1851, Berkowski produced a photograph (daguerreotype) of an eclipse and the corona
working from the Royal Observatory in Konigsberg (figure 24). The image has attracted a certain
mythology over the years and several astronomy books declare confidently that it was rushed to
the Great Exhibition in London to be admired. The source for the story is opaque and the records
for the exhibition show no clear evidence to confirm it.

More central to the history of eclipse photography is the fact that the Science Museum
collection includes the Kew Photoheliograph (figure 25). This was the first astronomical
instrument specifically designed for photographing celestial objects. Designed for the Royal
Society by Warren de la Rue in 1857, it was built by instrument maker Andrew Ross, London.
First installed at Kew Observatory, it was used to take regular photographs of the Sun. Later, it

was taken to northern Spain and here it was employed to photograph the 1860 total eclipse of the
Sun. The resulting images were used to resolve the debate as to whether prominences, red flames
seen at solar eclipses, were intrinsic to the Sun or atmospheric effects. It was subsequently used
as a model for a whole series of photographic telescopes for recording the Sun.
