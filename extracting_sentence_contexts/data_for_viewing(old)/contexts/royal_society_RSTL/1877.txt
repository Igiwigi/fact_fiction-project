but slowly from this value.

Now if we suppose, with Mr. LaerLace, the mean density
of the earth to be to that of the superficial parts as 1.55 to 1,
it appears from this table, that the height of the modulus of
elasticity must be about .594; that is, more than 12 million
feet, while the modulus of the hardest and most elastic sub-
stances, that have been examined, amounts only to about
10 million. It follows therefore, that the general law, of a
compression proportionate to the pressure, is amply sufficient
to explain the greater density of the internal parts of the
earth; and the fact demonstrates, that this law, which is true
for small pressures in all substances, and with regard to elas-
tic fluids, in all circumstances, requires some little modifica-
tion for solids and liquids, the resistance increasing' 80mewhat
faster than the density: for no mineral snbstance is suffi-
ciently light and incompressible to afford a sphere of the
magnitude of the earth, and of so small a specific gravity,
without some such deviation from the general law. A sphere
of water would be incomparably more dense, and one of air
would exceed this in a $till greater proportion: indeed, even
the moon, if she is really perforated, as has sometimes been
believed, and contains cavities of any considerable depth,
would $oon have absorbed into her substance the whole of
