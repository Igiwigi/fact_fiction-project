regions.

‘WALLACE commences (vol. 1, p. 54) :—“ The first essential is a broadly marked and
easily remembered set of regions.” This is quite right; but it is clear that WALLACE
had in his mind only one of the functions which he required of his regions, viz., their
use as areas of reference, when he wrote these words. When it comes to referring the
habitats of tens of thousands of specimens to some framework, such framework of
tabulation areas must be the simplest possible; each area must be bounded by a
precisely defined line ; nor must it be necessary frequently to have recourse to a large
scale map to determine whether a specimen was collected in Region I. or in Region IIL.

It will be noticed at once that my framework of tabulation areas differs very little
from WALLACE’s natural zoologic regions. I have, in fact, reduced the former from
the latter, with the minimum of alteration that would enable me to use it for
practical reference, The main difference noticeable at first sight is that I have extended
the boundary lines over the sea so as to include the oceanic islands in the adjacent
continental areas. I should observe that I do not mean or propose by this map to
divide the sea into tabulation areas; the subject of marine biologic regions has its
own additional difficulty, and I leave it to those competent to deal with it. But
however alike in general aspect are WALLAcK’s map (A) and my map (B), they
represent different aims; WaAttacr’s map (A) represents the World divided into
the most natural regions for the Mammalia; my map (B) is intended to represent the
World divided into convenient areas of universal reference; I do not admit that the
areas and sub-areas in it are inferior in naturalness to any scheme of regions yet
proposed ; but that is not my point. I have had the advantage of showing this
