The last hypothesis, which I mentioned, that which refers
animal heat to vital action, has many facts in its support, and
especially the results of Mr. Brovrz's curious and interesting
experiments; and the results of my inquiry, as I have already
observed, are not incompatible with it, It may be said, that the
viscera of the thorax and abdomen are of highest temperature,
because these parts are, as it were, the elaboratories of life; and
that the heat of the arterial blood, and of the parts best s8up-
plied with this fluid, is greatest, because they lie deepest and
abound most in the principle of life or vital action. This ex-
planation was suggested to me by my brother Sir H. Davy.
There are some facts which T have observed agreeable to it,
but not more s0 than to the hypothesis of Dr. BLack. I have
found the stomach of the ox, the pyloric compartment, of a
higher temperature than the left ventricle itself; thus when
the latter immediately after death was 10g, the former full of
food was 104.5. TI have also found the temperature of young
animals, in whom all the vital actions are most energetic,
higher than that of animals arrived at maturity. I may men-
tion here, in illustration of this statement, a few observations
made on infants, as I am not acquainted with any yet pub-
liched. In one instance I found the heat under the axilla of
