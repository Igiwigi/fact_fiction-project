According to these authors, different citizen scientists will be driven by their own set of individual
motivations, and more research is needed to shed light on the science learning outcomes, if any,
gained by the contributing volunteers. On the other hand, a study conducted among the astronomy scientific community gives us
some insights into scientists’ views on education and public outreach [4]. The authors of that
study highlighted the fact that astronomers develop their scientific aptitude from a very early
stage (often at primary school level), and therefore they see the benefits of exposing youngsters
to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) related activities. The authors also
point out that outreach is still seen by many peers as a hobby and it often lacks financial support
from grants and policy-makers, alongside a lack of encouragement from senior staff within
academic departments. Earlier familiarization with STEM subjects was also the topic of a recent report commissioned
by the Women In Science and Engineering (WISE) organization under their campaign
‘People like me’ [5] (www.wisecampaign.org.uk/uploads/wise/files/not_for_people_like_
me.pdf).
