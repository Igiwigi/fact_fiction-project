STOMATAL FREQUENCY, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO WOODLAND FLORA. 33

Considering both surfaces of the leaf together, the mean number of stomata per
sq. mm. for the shade flora is 92, with a “ standard error ” of 7-53. For the marginal
species the mean for both surfaces is 166-8 and the “ standard error” 9. The differences
of the means is, therefore, 74-8 and the “standard error of the difference ”’ 11-73.
Here again then there can be no doubt that the frequency of stomata per unit of leaf
area is appreciably greater for the leaves of marginal species in general than for those
of the shade flora, in general.

This difference is in harmony with the well-known fact that the stomatal frequency
is greater for “ sun-leaves ” than for “ shade-leaves,”’ but the fact just demonstrated
must not be confused with this. The observed ranges for the individual species include
both sun and shade leaves, and, therefore, the lower frequency in the shade species, as
compared with the marginal species, is to be regarded as a parallel phenomenon with
regard to the various species to what we know to obtain with respect to individuals.
The case is analogous to the fact that xerophytes in general tend to be more hairy than
mesophytes, and at the same time potentially hairy species tend to become glabrous
when growing in humid environments.

A comparison of the observed ranges for the shade and marginal floras respectively
further emphasises the difference.
