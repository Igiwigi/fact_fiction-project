It is one of the leading causes of hospital-acquired the major bovine S. aureus complex, one of which has now
infections, although infections outside of hospitals have emerged globally [46]. Human isolates of CC97 have since
increased in frequency in the past decade [41]. Staphylococcus increased over 10-fold during 5 years in Denmark [46].

aureus is, however, able to infect more than just humans and The relatively high number of host shifts involving S.
