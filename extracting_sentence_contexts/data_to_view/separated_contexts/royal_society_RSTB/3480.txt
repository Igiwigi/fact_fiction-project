This
includes, as its posterior component, the original “ primitive-streak area,” whilst
anteriorly it comprises the entire region traversed by the, now greatly elongated,
’ archenteric axis. A further characteristic of the attainment of the postgastrular
condition is (c) the intimate apposition of the anterior end of the primitive streak
with the posterior boundary of the archenteric knot, so that an appearance of
confluence or continuity is presented, as in the case of the ordinary mammalian
primitive streak and Huensen’s knot. Were it not for the fact of the original
distinctness of these two structures in the preceding stage, the faint demarcation
between them which persists at the present stage might possibly have been
overlooked, in series of transverse sections. The serial photomicrographs, figs. 29-33,
