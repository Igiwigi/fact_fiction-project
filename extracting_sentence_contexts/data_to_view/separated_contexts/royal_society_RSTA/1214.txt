The
“0

value of f() for large values of » was determined by the assumption p = ["y(o).d @.

This leads to the same result as MaxwELt’s relaxation hypothesis, namely, that the
couple necessary to maintain a fixed twist decreases exponentially to zero with the
increase of time, thus giving a 100 per cent. permanent set. And the assumption is

therefore in direct contradiction to the fact that | ¥().do must not have a value
0

exceeding 0-03 per cent. of the value of », when the solid is strained only within the
practically defined limit of perfect (statical) elasticity. From this determination of
¥ (@), and assuming ¢() = ¥ (@), BourzMann calculated a value of the logarithmic
decrement of a torsional pendulum.
