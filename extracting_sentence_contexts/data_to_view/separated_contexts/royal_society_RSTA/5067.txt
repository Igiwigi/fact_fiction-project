The active tendon control strategy works by providing a cable anchorage to the structure, with
the cable force or the displacement of the cable support controlled by an actuator. Staino et al. [19]
proposed the use of active tendon control for suppressing edgewise vibrations, but the control
system arrangement could be equally applicable for controlling flapwise displacements as well
(by rotating the cable/tendon arrangement inside the blade by 90Â°) as shown in the following
sections. In fact, two sets of orthogonal cable arrangements can be used to facilitate independent
control in two orthogonal directions. An appropriate control algorithm can then be used to
actuate the tendon controller. Active tendon control to mitigate flapwise blade vibrations has been
investigated in [39,40].
