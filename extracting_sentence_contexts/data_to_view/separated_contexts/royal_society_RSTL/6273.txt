Thus, whilst the temperature pro-
Zuced within a given flame is lowered by rarefaction, the escape of heat from its
Bxterior is hindered by the same process,—the result apparently being that the actual
Semperature of the flame undergoes but little alteration. 'Fhis confirms Davy's con-
Dusion, that rarefaction and compression, within certain limits at teast, do not exert any
Jonsideradle influence upon the heat of flame.
z Although an inquiry into two of the possible causes of the diminution of the light of
*Zombustion in rarefied atmospheres has thus failed to afford any explanation of the
FShenomenon, yet one of them indirectly points to what I believe to be the conditions
Yetermining the variation in illuminating power. If it be true that combustion is more
Somplete in rare atmospheres than in dense ones, it follows that the light of a smokeless
Fame must decrease with a diminution of pressure, since, with more perfect combustion,
Zhat is, with freer access of oxygen to every part of the flame, there must be a diminution
of unconsumed carbon separated within the flame, and consequently a diminished amount
of light evolved. In fact, the appearance of the experimental flame during the progress
of rarefaction on the one hand, and of compression on the other, can scarcely leave a doubt
'on the mind of an observer, that the variation of luminosity depends essentially upon
the admission of oxygen to that portion of the shell of flame where particles of carbon
are usually precipitated, and where consequently the region of luminosity is situated. That an admission of oxygen or air to the interior of a luminous flame has the effect of
greatly diminishing or even practically annihilating its luminosity, has been long known
