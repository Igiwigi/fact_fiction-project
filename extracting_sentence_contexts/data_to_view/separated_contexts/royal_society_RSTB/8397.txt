Although the effects of aberrant X chromosome inacti-
vation are not apparent in the pre-implantation stage, X

inactivation is also essential for post-implantation develop- 0.2050 4

that the existence of two epigenetically different X chromo- PCA2
somes is necessary for the proper control of Xist expression
in pre-implantation embryos, because aberrant Xist expres-
sion is observed in both parthenogenetic and androgenetic
embryos [76,77]. This might be related to the fact that ectopic
expression of Xist in the pre-implantation-cloned embryo is
the major cause of the low somatic-cell-cloning efficiency
mentioned earlier [45,46]. Aberrations of the monoallelic expression of imprinted
genes induce distinct congenital diseases. There is increasing
evidence of a link between ART and imprinting diseases,
such as Beckwith—Wiedemann syndrome [78-88], Angelman
syndrome [83,89,90] and Silver—Russel syndrome [91-93].
