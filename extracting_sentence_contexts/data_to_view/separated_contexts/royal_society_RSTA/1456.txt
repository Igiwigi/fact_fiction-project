Leaving aside abundant metaphysical and science fiction based ramifications, entanglement
stands as a highly counterintuitive and difficult phenomenon to deal with by the current methods
of theoretical science. Addressing quantum correlations with machine learning is plainly a major
challenge [19].

(c) Hyper-dimensions

We are used to living in three spatial dimensions, plus time, and we are clearly often in difficulty
in going further. In fact, visualizing objects, not to mention dynamic phenomena, in just three
dimensions seems to be complicated enough, as everyone dealing with visualization software

knows all too well. Yet most problems inhabit a much larger domain, known as phase-space. : =

Macroscopic systems consist of a huge number of individual components, typically in the : S
order of the Avogadro number A, ~6 x 10% for the case of standard quantities of matter : Ss
that we encounter. If each component is endowed with just six degrees of freedom, say : =
its position in space and its velocity, this makes six times Avogadro’s number of variables, DR
namely a mathematical problem in six times Avogadro’s number of dimensions.
