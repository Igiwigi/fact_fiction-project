Cand with two Si and four C atoms.

squares over hexagons to octagons where the latter ones only appeared in combination with
other rings due to topological constraints as octagons alone cannot form a complete periodic
covering of the two-dimensional plane or a cylinder surface. Many of these structures, such
as the combination of 8- and 4-rings and of 8- plus 6- plus 4-rings, have also been observed
in the structure prediction of periodic pure two-dimensional-planar arrangements of Si and C
atoms (figure 3); similarly, some structures are reminiscent of the projection of the B-BeO crystal
structure into two dimensions, which also reveals 4-rings and 8-rings.

In the mixed-system BepMg12_ O12 (n= 1,...,11) shown in figures 4 and 5, we again observed
combinations of a multitude of ring sizes. Here, we remark that, in contrast to the planar
Si/C system (figure 3), we did not observe 5- or 7-rings. This is presumably due to the fact
that (a) the number of atoms inside the simulation cell was not large enough, and, more
likely, (b) the positively charged Be and Mg ions prefer to establish isotropic surroundings by
negatively charged oxygen ions in their nearest neighbourhood. In turn, these anions try to form
a dense packing on the surface of the cylinder, which does not favour odd-numbered rings.
Furthermore, a cylinder surface has zero mean curvature, and thus—in contrast to a sphere
(c.f. the 12 pentagons in the C9 molecule)—we do not need to introduce 5-rings into a perfect
hexagon-network, to fulfil Euler’s rule.

Another related example that falls into the purview of structure prediction is the search
for the optimal distribution of (identical) charged particles that are located on the surface of a
