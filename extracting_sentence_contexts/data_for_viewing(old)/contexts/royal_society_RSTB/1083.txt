Hetp (25) has shown, by the myelination method, that this nucleus
crossed and uncrossed connections with the antero-lateral ground bundles,
the lateral limiting layer of the spinal cord by means of the longitudina
systems of the reticular formation. OnurRowrcz (24), moreover, has fow
division of the auditory nerve is not followed by atrophy of the cells of J
nucleus.

These facts, taken in conjunction with our observations, indicate that the i
division of the restiform body, as described, is an efferent cerebellar tract co
the middle lobe of the cerebellum with Derrers’ nucleus, and support the
this nucleus is an internode in the cerebello-spinal system. In further cont
of this view is the fact that in one of our experiments (Exp. 4), in which the:
of Derrers was injured, there was a tract of descending degeneration in the
column of the spinal cord. (Vide infrw, p. 743.)

ould, @ priori, expect, complete cerebellar extirpation is followed by
e cerebello-olivary system on both sides, combined with atrophy of the
ision of the restiform body. This experiment naturally removes the
portion of the internal division so that its condition cannot be determined
mut the medullated network of Derrers’ nucleus seemed to have undergone
