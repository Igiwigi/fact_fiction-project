Comparison of the vertebral column of Lepidosteus with that of other 9

The peculiar form of the articulatory faces of the vertebre of Lepidostens ca ;
L. AGas81z (No. 2) to compare them with the vertebra of Reptiles, and subseq
anatomists have 8uggested that they more nearly resemble the vertebre of
Urodelous Amphibia than those of any other form. If, however, GorrTe's account of the formation of the amphibian vertebre is co
there are serious objections to a comparison between the vertebra of Lepidosteus
Amphibia on developmental grounds, The essential point of similarity 8upposed
exist between them consists in the fact that in both there is a great development
intervertebral cartilage which consbricts the notochord ok and forms
articular faces of contiguous vertebre. In Lepidosteus this cartilage is, as we have seen, derived from the bases of i
arches ; but in Amphibia it is held by GorTe to be formed by a special thickening of
a cellular sheath round the notochord which is probably homologous with the carti-
laginous sheath of the notochord of Elasmobranchii, and therefore with part of the
notochordal sheath placed within the membrana elastica externa,

If the above statements with reference to the origin of the intervertebral cartilage
in the two types are true, it is clear that no homology can exist between structures 80
differently developed. Provisionally, therefore, we must look elsewhere than in
Lepidosteus for the origin of the amphibian type of vertebre.

"The researches which we have recorded demonstrate, however, 1a a very conclusive
manner that the vertebrze of Lepidosteus have very close affinities with those of
Teleostei. :

In support of this statement we may point : (1) To the structure of the sheath of
the notochord ; (2) to the formation of the greater part of the bodies of the vertebra
from ossification in membrane around the notochord ; (3) to the early biconcave form
of the vertebrz, only masked at a later period by the development of interyeriob
cartilages ; (4) to the character of the neural arches.
