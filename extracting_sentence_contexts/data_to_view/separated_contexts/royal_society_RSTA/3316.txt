Proposition 2.1 (Paralinearization of the DN operator). Let G(h) be the operator defined in (1.8),
with (1.5)—-(1.6), and let w,B, V be given by (2.5). Then we have

G(h) = Tapyo — div(Tyh) + Go, (2.6)
where G2 denotes smoother terms which are also quadratic in the unknowns, and the symbol of the operator
is given by

This proposition shows the relevance of the good unknown in the fact that the main action of =
the DN map can be expressed in terms of a paradifferential operator acting on , plus a simple 7°83

Using (2.6) and standard paralinearization arguments, one can reduce (1.7) to the following : Ss
