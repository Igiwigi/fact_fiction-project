(f) Quantification of the absolute transcript numbers
The copy number of the transcripts (X;) was quantified using the following method [19]:

CG

X= oF T, (2.1)
where C; represents the mapped reads on a transcript i with a length L; (in nt), C = 7; C; is the sum
of all mapped reads within a RNA-Seq dataset, whereas T is the length of the transcriptome in
base pairs [19]. From the reads and the amount of the added spike-in standard, we determined the
number of molecules of spike-in standard in nt. T was calculated by converting the total mRNA
mapped reads in each RNA-Seq experiment into molecules of mRNA (in nt) using the number
of molecules of spike-in standard (nt) and normalized per cell number quantified by fluorescence
activated cell sorting (FACS).

The length of the transcriptome, T, in base pairs, is calculated as follows:

(i) The amount (nanograms) of added spike-in standard was converted into molecules
spike-in in nt using the molecular weight and nucleotide length of the spike-in and the
Avogadro number.

(ii) The total amount of mRNA to which the spike-in was added was converted into nt using
the molecules of spike-in (nt) and the sequencing reads mapped to the transcriptome and
spike-in standard.

(iii) The total mRNA length (nt) was divided by the cell number quantified by FACS to
