In 1994, a very original system was proposed [46,47]. The idea was to consider
spin-1/2 particles propagating through a chain of spaced magnetic regions ¥,,
n=0,1,...), each single region ¥Y, being composed of a linear array of two
ypes of magnets, A and B, aligned normal to the chain axis and forming a
fixed angle with respect to each other. The successive arrays, furthermore, should
follow the Fibonacci pattern Yo = A, Y; =B, Y2=BA, Y3 = BAB, Y,=BABBA,
2X; = BABBABAB, and so on. The interesting dynamical variable here is the spin
rotation angle @,, (with respect to a reference axis) after crossing each magnetic
region ¥,,. It was shown that the rotation angles were exponentially sensitive to
he exact values of the magnetic field strengths. In other words, it was a purely
quantum system showing exponential sensitivity, in principle, characteristic of
nonlinear classical problems. The whole discussion was raised [48,49] owing
o the fact that, in the classical parlance, exponential sensitivity owing to
nonlinearities is related to the initial conditions. However, in the mentioned
example, the sensitivity is associated with the system parameters and not with the
initial preparation of the system, namely the starting wave function. So, strictly
speaking, this system is not chaotic in the classical sense. Presently, a fully closed
quantum system displaying any exponential sensitivity in its initial conditions
remains unknown (however, for a classical-quantum interaction, see [50]).

The above example illustrates that, since the concepts of trajectories and
phase space in classical mechanics must be faced differently in QM [51,52], two
fundamental features of nonlinear systems: (i) exponential sensitivity to the initial
conditions and (ii) complex topological structures of the phase space (strange
attractors, density of periodic orbits, mixing filamentation, etc.) are absent in
