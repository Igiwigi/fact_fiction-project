This curve forms the zero line for potential gradient, «e., the differences of the
ordinates of this curve and of the actual trace obtained when the sphere is exposed
give a measure of the potential gradient at any moment. In fig. 2 is reproduced the record of May 12, 1917, from 16h. 50m, to 17h. 35m. The sky was overcast and the weather conditions suggested thunder—a storm did in
fact occur some hours later. The sphere was momentarily raised at 16h. 51m. ; raised
again at 16h. 55m., and kept up till 17h. 23m., being however momentarily lowered
into its case at 5-minute intervals during this time; it was kept in its case after
17h. 23m. The potential gradient was 150 volts per metre at 16h. 51m. ; it gradually
diminished till it reached negative values, and continued to be negative from
17h. 12m. 50s. till 17h. 18m. 10s., reaching a minimum of —80 volts per metre at
17h. 16m., becoming positive again and being equal to 260 volts per metre when the
sphere was lowered at 17h. 23m.
