Given the relation between action differences and phase space areas,
each local maximum or minimum in the curve occurs at a crossing point of the perturbed and
unperturbed unstable manifold. It is at those locations where the sign changes from a positive
action difference to negative or vice versa. In fact, the difference of the value between a minimum
and the next maximum, or maximum and the next minimum, is the area contained between the
two manifolds from the loop formed by successive crossing points. We will return to these areas
just ahead; here let us call the set {55j}. Following the behaviour of the perturbed and unperturbed
manifolds over a great distance leads to a statistical behaviour in their action differences.
