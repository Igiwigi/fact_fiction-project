quite distinct, although that of Diplolabis stands somewhat nearer to Zygopteris. There
can be no question of any near affinity, although all three genera belong to the group
with foliar bundles devoid of peripheral loops.

The only other zygopterid at present known to possess secondary wood is Ankyropteris
corrugata (Scort, 1912, pp. 376, 382), recently described in detail by Hoiprn, 1930,
Plate 7, figs. 4 and 5; Plate 8, fig. 18a.* Scorr (loc. cit., p. 884) drew attention to
several points of resemblance with Botrychioxylon, and some of these apply also to Z.
primaria: the “mixed pith” (somewhat doubtful in our species), the temporary
abaxial curve in the leaf-trace, and the presence of secondary xylem in both stem and
root (only occasionally in A. corrugata). An uncommon feature described by HoLDEN
(1980, p. 85) is the presence of traumatic secondary wood in the petiole of A. corrugata,}
recalling a character which is normal in Z. primaria. But in spite of all these facts
the closed peripheral loops of Ankyropteris remain a serious obstacle to any close affinity
with Zygopleris, as with Botrychioxylon.

There is no other genus of Zygopterids, sufficiently well known, with which Z. primaria
can be even remotely compared.

Summary.

Zygopteris primaria (Corra) Corp was one of the first known Zygopteridee, originally
described over a century ago, but our knowledge of it was hitherto confined to the
petiole, and that too was defective. In the present paper the structure of the stem,
leaf-trace and root is described for the first time, from an old specimen in the Cotta
