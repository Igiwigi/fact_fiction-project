Unless we suppose them inherited, these peculiarities
must have a direct cause or direct causes. One question is, therefore, whether the
abnormal or oblique phenomena of development are so related to one another that
direct causation can be d√©duced from their sequence. If so, what is the binding law
of the causation ; or, what theory will best describe the facts ? With regard to the relation between the phenomena, it is true that the asymmetry
develops in a regular manner, just as if it belonged to the ordinary course of develop-
ment, but if we compare the life histories of different species, we find that the
progressiveness or rate of change from the normal depends upon recognisable factors
(ef. Pleuronectes and Gilyptocephalus, S. vulgaris and S. variegata).
