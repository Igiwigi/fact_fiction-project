In these diseases, therefore,
amongst whites there is an excess of F. deaths of only 176, whereas amongst the
much smaller coloured population the excess of F. deaths amounted to 545. PRODUCED BY WHITES AND COLOURED PEOPLES IN CUBA. 311

The chief diseases which cause the excess of M. deaths among whites above 5 yeurs
are: diseases of the digestive system, including enteritis (M. 689, F. 383); typhoid
(M. 124, F. 61); malaria (M. 244, F. 88); diseases of the nervous system (especially
meningitis) and tetanus. (M, 5038, F. 280); bronchitis and other respiratory diseases
(M. 762, F. 679); giving a total of M. 2322, F. 1491, that is an excess of M. 831 for
the single year 1905. If the interpretation I have put upon the facts is true, it is clear that an excess of
F. births over deaths is not necessarily a true indication of the virility of a people,
for the excess of F, adults may be gained in consequence of a high death-rate among
M. (whites in Cuba). At the same time it is evident that the mere production of a
large proportion of F. does not necessarily ensure a high birth-rate, for the proportion
may be greatly reduced by death before their reproductive power has been fully
exercised (coloured in Cuba). That the initial virility of a race may be judged in accordance with the proportion
of F. births I see no reason to doubt, but it is necessary the individual should repro-
duce before any practical effect can be exercised on the race.
