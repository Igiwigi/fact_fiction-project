The bases of leaves or bracts are present, and the radial sections show that each of
these appendages is bilobed, one lobe being superior or ventral, and the other inferior
or dorsal (see Plate 6, figs. 24 and 25; also Wittramson’s fig. 30 above cited). The
lobes were, no doubt, each sub-divided into segments in the horizontal plane (see
Photograph 18, figs. 26 and 27; also Wiutamson’s fig. 29), but only the stumps
of these segments remain. The lower lobe appears to have been the broader, for at
several places in the radial sections it is shown in its full extent, where the upper
lobe is either missed altogether, or only partially shown (Figs. 24 and 25), The
lower lobe was often, perhaps always, trifid, receiving the three anterior branches of
the leaf-trace ; the upper lobe appears to have been more frequently bifid, receiving
two bundles only (see Photograph 18, and fig. 9), but sometimes this also received
three bundles, as shown in Fig. 27. That this is really an upper lobe is shown by
the fact that its bundles do not separate until quite near the periphery.

Owing to the paucity of the sections of the pedunclet and their frequent obscurity,
it has not been possible to work out the course of the bundles with the same minute-

ness and certainty as in the axis of the cone. Enough, however, is shown to prove
that their course and subdivisions follow the same general rules as in the axis, with

+ There are seven sections altogether, all in the Witt1AMson collection. Four of these (C.N. 539-542)
are transverse; two (C.N. 543 and 544) are approximately radial; and one (C.N. 545) tangential. The
last mentioned is too obscure to throw much light on the course of the bundles; where it passes
