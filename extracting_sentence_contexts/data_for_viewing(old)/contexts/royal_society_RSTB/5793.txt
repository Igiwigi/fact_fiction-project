indefinitely in the reverse direction. The normal divergence angle was again approached
after a few oscillations above and below.

5. These results support the theory that each primordium arises in the largest gap
between those already present. But a more precise hypothesis is that it arises in the
first space that becomes both wide enough and distant enough from the growing-point.
This is adopted as the working hypothesis.

6. The increase in angle between the next two primordia after the isolated primordium,
is partly the direct result of the shift of the growing-point towards the gap between
them, and is partly due to the fact that the second primordium is displaced, relatively
to the primordia below it, in the direction of the wound.

7. It is shown to be in accordance with expectation that the increase in this angle
is greater after isolation of I, than of P,. The displacement of the second primordium
is explained, on the working hypothesis, as due to three different factors working
together, and the explanation is supported by various observations. The shape of the
primordia is discussed and a diagram is constructed.

8. After isolation of I,, the results were sometimes essentially the same as after
isolation of I,, the genetic spiral being reversed. But sometimes another primordium,
I,/, arose before I;, obliquely above the wound or directly above it, and the spiral was
then not reversed. These results are interpreted on the working hypothesis.
