Cuvier (18) noticed that
Z the thymus and other glands diminish the capacity of the chest in hibernating
E animals. In 1817, however, JACoB80N (19) showed that the glands in the thorax,
= which enlarge in the winter sleep, are not thymus ; and that the thymus behaves in
YL animals which hibernate, as in other animals ; and maintained that the thymus has
S nothing in common with the peculiar glands lying in its neighbourhood, either in its
E development, appearance, or secretion. He was followed by RuporLent (20) and
A HavasreD (1), the latter giving drawings of the two organs at various periods of liſe ;
and the facts were further confirmed by Barxow (21) and others. S1MoN (2),
however, accepted the older doctrine, holding that the thymus is very large in hibernat-
ing animals, and he partially founded upon this supposed fact his view of the function
of the organ. The second error arose, as has been stated, about the game time.
