reference to the fact that an individual entity is, in Lowe’s terms, ‘the single object that it is
[.--] distinct from others’ [3, p. 75]. On the other hand, the notion of (in)distinguishability makes
reference to the fact that an entity might be endowed with certain properties by means of which
it can (or not) be distinguished from other entities (for a discussion of these different notions
see [4]). The notions of identity, individuality and indistinguishability as well as their interrelations elicit
in particular the following questions:

— Is identity a primitive relation (as Frege maintained?) or can it be defined in terms of other
predicates, as in the Hilbert-Bernays definition? With regard to this question and related
matters, see [6], [7, §5], [8, pp. 63-64], [9, pp. 12-15] and [10].

— Isidentity a universal notion or is it always relative to a given ontological domain [11-15]?

— Is it possible and/or necessary to conceive an ontology (or a philosophical logic)
without a predicate of identity [1]?
