Whether Steeple Aſhton is from its ſituation par=
ticularly expoſed to thunder-ſtorms, ,is uncertain.
It may however be proper to mention, that in the
year 1670, July the 25th, a violent ſtorm of
thunder and lightning damaged the church ſteeple,
which was 93 feet high; and on the 15th of Oc-
tober in the ſame year, another thunder ſtorm threw
it entirely down, and killed two of the work--
men, who were repairing it.

We have peruſed, and carefully examined the
above account, and hereby teſtify the truth of all:
the facts related in it, to. the beſt of. our. know»:
ledge and belief..
