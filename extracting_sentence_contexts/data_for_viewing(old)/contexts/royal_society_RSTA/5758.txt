both branches and cause of the formation of a new carina contour (see figure 10 versus figure 11).
This reduction in shear stress can lead to atherogenesis and the formation of atherosclerotic
plaques after the bifurcation.

The presence of significant instantaneous flow rate gradients leads to large fluctuations in
the dynamic viscosity of blood, which can vary several times (figure 15). So, for example, in the
zones of slow circulating blood flows (panels 1, 3 and 4, figure 11), small instantaneous velocity
gradients can occur, leading to high values of the dynamic blood viscosity. And this circumstance
can be potentially dangerous in terms of the development of stent thrombosis.



Finally, despite the fact that the study focused on a specific case of hemodynamics, we believe
that the nature of the phenomena considered in this work will be of interest to a wide range of
specialists, including the cardiology practitioners for whom the choice of cardiac intervention
tactics is a critical issue.
