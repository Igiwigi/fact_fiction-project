The mean dissociation energies of
the zinc-carbon bonds in zinc dimethyl and zinc diethyl, where the zinc atoms are left in
the ground (1S) state, are therefore seen to be 41-0 and 35:8 kcal. respectively. The dif:

radicals are usually found to be more tightly bound than ethyl radicals, and is in accordance
with the fact that at low pressures zinc diethyl vapour oxidizes much more rapidly than
does that of the dimethyl (Bamford & Newitt 1946a, 6). The dissociation energies for
zinc di-n-propyl and di-n-butyl could also be calculated if the energies required to remove
the first z-hydrogen atoms from the propane and n-butane molecules were known. With
reasonable asumptions regarding these latter quantities, the values for zinc dipropyl and
dibutyl are the same as that for the diethyl within the limits of experimental error.
