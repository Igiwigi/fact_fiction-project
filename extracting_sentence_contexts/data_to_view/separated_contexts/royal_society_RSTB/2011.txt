The results obtained with the colour varieties of Strongylocentrotus on the one
hand, and those of Spherechinus on the other, thus afford a somewhat instructive
comparison. In the one case, in which the colour varieties are not very distinctly
marked off, the differential fertility is so slight that it cannot with certainty be said
to have been demonstrated at all; whilst in the other case, where the varieties them-
selves are much more distinct, and where the individuals of intermediate character
are much less numerous, well-marked variations of physiological compatibility were in
every case shown to be present. Attention has already been drawn to the fact that the nature of the sperm is of
considerable influence on the size of the larvae. It was, of course, taken for granted
that the nature of the ovum had also an influence, but upon what does this influence
depend? Is it upon some intrinsic properties of the protoplasm, or chiefly upon the
actual amount of food material available in the ovum?
