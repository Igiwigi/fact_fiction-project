PROCESS IN THE VERTEBRATE HEART. 281

is clear that a wide area of muscle wall may be thrown into a state of activity before
the recording instrument is affected ; this fact requires emphasis because it has to be
taken into account in interpreting the natural axial electrocardiogram.

The next phase of the spread is more complex, the excitation wave having entered

surface of the ventricle is stimulated.

the Purkinje substance courses rapidly along the lining of the heart and re-enters
the muscle from within outwards, From this time onwards the excitation wave is
spreading along two routes: along the old path, which is radial to the point of
stimulation, and along the new path from the network. Tf we consider a point in the
region m, such a point may be activated by the surface wave, or it may be activated
2 by the wave travelling from within outwards. All points on the surface within the
