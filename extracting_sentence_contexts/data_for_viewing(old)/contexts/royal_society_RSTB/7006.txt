consists of a single layer of superficial cells, including the apical cell, of distinctive appearance
and chemical reaction; (ii) the region of initial differentiation, in which leaf primordia,
buds and scales originate superficially from cells within or on the margin of the apical
meristem and in which stele, cortex and pith can first be distinguished internally; (iii) the
region of subsequent differentiation which merges downwards with the fully matured tissue
systems. Since the principal morphogenetic developments take place in region (ii), it is
there that experimental treatments must be applied.

The first step is to have unimpeded access to the apical meristem. At first sight this does
not appear to be a very feasible undertaking. Indeed, because of the large number of
rolled leaves and leaf primordia in the terminal bud and the dense investment of scales,
the apices of ferns have not generally commended themselves as providing favourable
materials for experimental investigations. Nevertheless, it is a fact of experience that there
is little difficulty in removing the scales and leaf primordia from stout shoots of D. aristata
or D. filix-mas and thereby laying bare the apical cone. These operations are carried out
by means of small pointed scalpels and forceps, the material being observed under a binocular
* microscope (Wardlaw 19446). A downward view of the apical cone and of the associated
leaf primordia is illustrated diagrammatically in figure 1.
