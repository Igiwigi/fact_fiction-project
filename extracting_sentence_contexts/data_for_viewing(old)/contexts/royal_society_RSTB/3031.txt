The stems of the older trees are therefore from five to ten times stronger than is
necessary.* This is also shown by the fact that the sound main trunk of an ordinary
tree never snaps under wind pressure, and that stems completely hollowed out at
their bases, but not above, may remain erect for 100 years or more. Hence the
continued formation of new wood is not so much for mechanical requirements, as in
order to maintain good channels for the conveyance of water, that is, channels which
contain active living elements. The general rule may, in fact, be formulated, that
the more rapid the growth of an erect tree, the more slender will be its stem in
regard to its height, and that slowly-growing trees will have relatively bulky stems.
This is strikingly shown in the Tropics by palms, by such trees as Albizzia, etc., and
by bamboos. The stem of the giant bamboo may attain a height of 60 metres, while
not more than 40 centims. diameter near its base, which dimensions are not far short
of the theoretical limits. All these facts afford strong indirect evidence towards the
necessity of the presence of active living elements in the conducting wood of tall
trees, but, of course, leaves it an open question as to whether these living elements
exercise a direct pumping action.

Section 20.—Critical Velocity for Stream-line Flow in Wood Vessels.

PorsEvILLe’s formula for the flow of liquid through tubes only applies when the
motion takes place in straight lines. If the speed is high the motion becomes
turbulent, and the resistance increases as a power of the speed, rising to 1'8 or 2.

* A point of some interest in this connection lies in the fact that the modulus of elasticity varies much
less than the breaking strain in different woods, and even in the wood of the poplar, the same is shown,
