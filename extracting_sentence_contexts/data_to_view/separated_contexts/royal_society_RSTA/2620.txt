Water collection rates per unit surface area for flat surfaces with various wettability and beetle-inspired surfaces, : <
at 45Â° inclination. The wettability includes superhydrophobic, hydrophobic, hydrophilic (uncoated) and superhydrophilic 3
surfaces, and a beetle-inspired surface (which includes 0.5 mm diameter circular superhydrophilic spots surrounded by a 3
superhydrophobic surface (adapted from [58]). :k

and superhydrophilic. This is attributed to the fact that the higher the repellency, the more
spherical the droplet shape will be, which results in a lower contact area between the droplet
and the surface. Therefore, less heat will be transferred to the droplet and less evaporation will be
observed. Large spherical droplets are formed on the superhydrophobic surface which roll down.
