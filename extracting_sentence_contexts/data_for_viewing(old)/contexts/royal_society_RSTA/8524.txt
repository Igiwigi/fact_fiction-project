This equation arises in any attempt to find a suitable solution, and we shall call it the
cardinal equation. It is required to find an even solution Q (x), not necessarily—nor
in fact—expressible as a convergent series of power of z. The equation admits, indeed,
an infinite number of purely odd, purely even, or mixed solutions, and must be com-
bined with other conditions involved in the problem to obtain a unique suitable one—
and especially combined with the original equation, which is more general.

§16. Solution of the Cardinal Equation into an Eapansion Theorem.

The following solution is obtained by a symbolical method, which leaves something
to be desired from the point of view of rigour. But there is no actual doubt regarding
the final result. The direct form of the integral equation for Q(x), which does not use
the fact that ¢ (x) satisfies the homogeneous equation, is
