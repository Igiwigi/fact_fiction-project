Contrast with
young fruit-body of 7. excavatum (figure 116) at approximately same stage of development
(i.e. before the development of ascogenous hyphae) in which the venae externae are not filled.
(a, b) x20. (c)-(g) Types of venation of fruit-bodies of Tuber spp. (after Malengon 1938).
(c) = Malengonâ€™s type 1 in which veins converge to a small basal cushion or cavity. (d) =Type 2,
in which the main venation is as in type 1, but a few subsidiary veins open to other points on the
surface. (e)=Type 3, in which veins converge to larger basal area. (f)=Type 4, in which
main venation is as in type 3, but a few subsidiary veins open to other points on the surface.
(g)=Type 5, in which there is no convergence of veins to the base, but numerous systems
opening to irregularly distributed points on the surface.

Asci containing two or four nuclei are frequently present, and it is of interest that these
nuclei are often grouped together in the centre of the ascus (figure 15). In view of the
fact that germination of the ascospore and the subsequent development of a mycelium has
never been observed with certainty,* it is not impossible that the nuclear divisions are
abnormal. The unusual features described by Greis or an irregular fission of the nuclear
material might then occur. The nuclei are seen to abort at any stage, giving the irregular
number of spores characteristic of the genus.
