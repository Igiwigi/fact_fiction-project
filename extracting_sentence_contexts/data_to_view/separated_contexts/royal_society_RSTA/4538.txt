The next section will cover some of the prominent
approaches to study the evolution of impact-generated tsunami waves.

4. Quantitative assessment

jumerous attempts have been made to quantify impact-generated tsunami waves, including the
formation of waves, how they propagate across the ocean and the run-up process at the coast. The fact that no conclusive answer has been found to the question of whether impacts in the


marine environment produce mega-tsunamis of greater dimensions than any other generation
mechanism is due to deviating results from different methodological approaches.

(a) Analogue experiments

The first estimates are based on underwater nuclear explosion experiments suggesting an
empirical relationship between the energy Y equivalent of kilotonnes of TNT (1 kt TNT = 4.186 x
10!7J; in an impact event, the energy corresponds to the kinetic energy of the impactor), the wave
amplitude A as a function of distance r, and water depth h [27]: A = 45(h/ r(Y)°>. Gault & Sonett
[1] found similar scaling laws by conducting impact experiments with water-covered targets in
the laboratory. :

Based on larger scale explosion experiments to study waves, Van Dorn et al. [26] recognized :z
that nonlinear wave shoaling of large amplitude is an effective process to dissipate wave energy. :
The so-called ‘Van Dorn effect’ implies that explosion-generated, and, thus also impact-generated, |
tsunami waves attenuate quickly due to wave breaking and other nonlinear processes as the wave 1p
travels across a scaled continental shelf. The Van Dorn effect has not been considered in estimates :s
of the impact-induced tsunami hazard, leading to overprediction of run-up heights until Melosh :3
[20] raised the point (see also further discussion in §4c). :3

(b) Analytical approach: wave theory 3

Linear wave theory can be employed to analytically approach the propagation of impact-induced
tsunamis.
