This
science fiction speculates about scientists who travel to the Moon and experience low gravity,
but in the course of their adventure also witness a solar eclipse like no other: the Earth eclipsing
the Sun. This conceit is brought to life (in the eventual publication) through a splendid illustration
by Gotman (figure 35).

9. Concluding thoughts

As is so often the case, the best science fiction can foreshadow scientific reality. While Tsilkovsky
proposed one fresh view of eclipses, a splendid new exhibition at the Natural History Museum
(Otherworlds) also shows how a different viewpoint can have a dramatic impact. The exhibition explores the beauty of the solar system and draws upon composite
photographic images created by Michael Benson.â€™ These are derived from raw data provided
by the National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) and European Space Agency
(ESA).
