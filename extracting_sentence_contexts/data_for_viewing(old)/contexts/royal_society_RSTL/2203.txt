continual downward current, which carried with it the pebbles that were disturhed.
That the pebbles were not removed far from the line of low water, would appear
from the fact, that on the subsiding of the 8well, it being succeeded by a light breeze
of wind from the westward, the accumulation immediately commenced, and was
restored to its former quantity by the action of four tides. I have subsequently had
some favourable opportunities for making other obseryations on the effects produced
by different rates of succession of the waves, and particularly at Dover, during the
late gales, where the same actions were noticed. There I watched for an opportunity
of witnessing that rate of succession which exhibited the destructive and accumu-
lative actions in their smallest degrees; and I observed, that when ten breakers
arrived in one minute, the destructive action was but just evinced ; and that when
only eight breakers arrived in the same period, the pebbles began to accumulate ;
which facts harmonized with my observations made at Sandgate and Folkestone, viz.
that the difference between the two actions was determined by the rapidity in succession
of the waves upon the $shore.

In the description of the accumulative action, I have assumed the forces to be
directed obliquely with the line of coast, and have therefore necessarily included the
progressive motion ; but it remains to be explained in what manner the shingles are
carried forward while the destructive action is going on.

It is known that the action and reaction of the waves give to the whole body of
the water, within a certain distance from the shore, an undulating motion. The
direction of this motion, when approaching the shore, will, to a certain degree, corre-
spond with that of the wayes upon the surface, and the direction of the recoil will
