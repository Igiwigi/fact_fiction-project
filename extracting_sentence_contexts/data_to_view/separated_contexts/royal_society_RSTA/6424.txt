The novel does say, undoubtedly referring to its own project,
making the ‘I’ in the sentence that of Joyce: ‘I am working out a quantum theory about it for it is
really most tantumising [a play on tantalizing] state of affairs’ [46] (p. 149). At the surface level,
the shift from ‘tantalizing’ to ‘tantumising’ may be seen in terms of Shannon information, but only
at the surface level, for it still involves a play of qualia. But, apart from the fact that this sentence
alone does not tell us how the novel configures thus quantum theory, the ‘quantum theory’
