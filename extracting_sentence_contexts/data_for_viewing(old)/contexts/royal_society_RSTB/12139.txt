response needs; identifying and monitoring optimal interven-
tions or combinations of interventions; and forecasting for
response planning.

(a) Epidemiological descriptions of outbreaks
At the heart of epidemiology is the description of disease by
person, place and time [10]. An iconic example of this is the
investigation of cholera in London conducted by John Snow
in 1854, which is now considered to be the first modern
epidemiological investigation [11]. Good descriptive epid-
emiology is extremely powerful for decision makers as it
can quickly guide the direction of an outbreak response. In
fact, in many instances, descriptive analysis alone is sufficient
for guiding disease control efforts in the early phase of an
outbreak and more sophisticated analysis sometimes only
provides marginal gains for decision makers, often because
the results are usually available too late to be operationally
relevant.
