The parallax correction of heights, according to theory, is of the form

(P=p)(a+b.s,29). This agrees with the Bristol observations, which give
(P—p)(a+0.9,28—2P);

for the amount of this correction for a given parallax (as 60', for example,) is nearly

constant for all hours of transit, having, however, a maximum about 64" and a mini-

mum about 83". Hence Þ is about 74" in this case; the ratio of b to a, which is that

of the solar to the lunar tide in theory, appears to be smaller in fact. Indeed for

transit A the quantity b yanishes or becomes yery small, and the parallax correction

is nearly constant, for all hours. This appears to show that the transit B is under

better conditions than A, for obtaining this correction.
