I. InrRopucTION

In spite of the fact that the possible homologies of the mammalian vomer have
been under review for over fifty years, there still remain two strongly conflicting
opinions. The original view that the paired ‘‘prevomers” of the reptile fused to form
the single vomer of the mammal has been repeatedly attacked, and few writers
maintain this homology to-day. Instead, it is usually believed that the mammalian
vomer is a derivative of the reptilian parasphenoid, and that the reptilian “pre-
vomers”’ are represented in the mammal only by the palatine processes of the pre-
maxillae. But during the last few years doubts have been expressed about the validity
of some of the evidence used, and it has been claimed that there is now good reason
to return to the original homology.

Whether the mammalian vomer evolved from the parasphenoid or from the
““prevomers” is not, in itself; a very important matter. But the current parasphenoid-
