Since 122}x 3 = 366°7 and 73x 5 = 367°2,
the normal ratio of satellite separations is again reproduced. The evidence is clear,
therefore, for two groups of normal diffuse series depending on 79A, and 70A,
respectively. The fact that 20320 is connected with 1864 in the same way as 20312, that the
v, separation is not good, and that we should expect a doublet here in place of a triplet
rather point to the supposition that it is not a member of the set. For the D,; line
the sequent is 51025°29—16013°45 = 35011°84, on this the oun displacement produces
a change of 6°04 which accounts for the modified », = 1784°83 in the usual way. The
mantisse of the two D,, groups 20581, 20320 differ by 140.
