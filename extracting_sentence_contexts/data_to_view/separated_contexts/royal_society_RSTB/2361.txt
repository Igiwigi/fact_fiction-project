Thus all the observed genera of Schizeeaceze have a larger number of spores per
sporangium than the ordinary Leptosporangiate Ferns. The largest sporangia are
those of Lygodium, and they have the largest output. The fact that Lygodium
exceeds the other genera is interesting, as it is the genus specially selected by
ZeILLER, on other grounds, for comparison with Senftenbergia, one of the oldest
known Fern types. In its anatomy, also, Lygodiwm stands aloof from Aneimia and Mohria, and shows
characters more nearly comparable with Gleichenia,

As regards dehiscence, the Schizeeaceze resemble the Gleicheniaceze and Osmundacez ;
they require room laterally for successful dehiscence, a method suitable only for laxly
grouped sporangia. Summary for Schizeacee.

(1) The sporangia correspond to the type of the Gleicheniaceze, but with different
proportions ; their orientation is constant.

(2) The output of spores is typically 256 or 128 from each sporangium of
Lygodium, and 128 for Aneimia and Mohria.
