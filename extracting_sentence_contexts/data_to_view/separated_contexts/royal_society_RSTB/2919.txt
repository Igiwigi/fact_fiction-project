L., R. 7, b (fig. 29), where they are found in situ. The single bundle
a represented in this figure (v.b.) is still in continuity with the hypoderm (hy.), and
& is separated from the superficial palisade layer by about five layers of cells.
7 As the bundles approach the apex they pass outside the periphery of the plinth
3 and enter the canopy, one to each loculus (figs. 1, 23, and 30). That the bundles cling
very closely to the outside angle of the sinus (see phots. 6 and 9 and fig. 20) seems

suffered a centripetal displacement. No section, however, has passed through our
hands in which the bundles at this height are seen lying in situ, though in the
