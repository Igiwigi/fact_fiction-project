This may be the corresponding
line sought for, but if so the line 11630 must be F,(4) and the lines F, (4), F, (4)
would then be absent. These lines were at firstt assigned by PAscHEN to a new
doublet set of series, but later{ to combinations of his new singlet series with D, (~),
D, (©). This question will be considered as a whole later, but the suggested
explanation given above points rather to the fact that we have to do with a triplet
series in which the third number is too faint to be observed.

* D() stands as usual for D,( %) or Dy (~ ).
