In that branch of the research which deals with the causes of the coincidences of the
lines in the various spectra, it is not absolutely essential that we should refer the lines
to the solar spectrum each time ; thus if we study the cases of aluminium and calcium
impurities, it is better to photograph the suspected spectra side by side and confront
them.

To do this all that is necessary is to extend the application of the principle already
referred to. In fact the only practical limit to the number of spectra we can get on to
one plate is the time the plate takes to dry, and instead of uncovering half of the slit at
one time we may uncover any smaller portion. (See Plate XXXIX.)

This I have effected by means of a brass shutter with a 8quare opening cut through
it, which slides in grooves in front of and up and down the lit. On one side of the
shutter holes are bored, the distance between each hole being the same as the height of
the opening in the shutter. A short pin fixed to a spring falls into each hole in 8uc-
cession as the shutter is moved up or down, and 80 ensures that there shall be neither
superposition of spectra nor gaps between them. The accompanying diagram (fig. 4)
will make the arrangement quite clear.

I find that, by the use of the shutter, four or more spectra showing positions and
