The only respect in which equation (78) differs from the usual equation between
the motion of gas and the variation of pressure in a tube is that instead of p we have

The difference between equations (78) and (79) is, however, very important. For
whereas þ is usually supposed to be constant, 7.e., independent of the diameter of the
tube, it appears from (78) that 8nch can only be the case 80 long as c is large as
compared with s: s being a distance measured across the tube which by no variation
in the condition of the gas can be made larger than the mean diameter of the tube. This fact, that s cannot increase beyond the diameter of the tube at once explains
the anomalies (as they appeared to GRAnam) between the times of transpiration for
fine and coarse plugs. The mean diameter of the interstices of GRanam's coarse plugs were 80 large, that,
with gas in the condition in which he used it, s was less than this diameter, and not
being limited to the diameter of the tube was different for different gases and for
different conditions of the same gas ; whereas with the fine plugs, s being limited to
the diameter of the tube, could no longer vary with the nature of the gas. The limit to the value of s also indicates, what has been verified by the experiments
described in Part I. of this paper, that the results which GrRanam obtained with fine
plates only, are to be obtained with coarse plates when the condition of the gas is such
that s is limited by the diameter of the interstices.
