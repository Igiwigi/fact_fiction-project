Regarded as a whole, it is impossible to doubt that this organ is
one of the segmental organs. If this be admitted, the conclusion cannot be resisted, that
the vesicular outgrowth (c) is really the ovary or the testes in process of development. But in the same individual the other and ordinary segmental organs have altogether a dif-
ferent form and structure (fig. 4 A. @ a, a, and B)> Thus is adduced another well-attested
fact, in confirmation of the view maintained in this paper, viz. that the reproductive
organs in Nais and Lambricus are in reality nothing but a modification of the © segmental
organs” or © ciliated tubes” which exist, in pairs, in every annulus of the body. Parth-worm.—The anatomy of the reproductive system in the Earth-worm has been
made a subject of express investigation by many competent comparative anatomists. The points in difference between the author and other observers will be indicated as
we proceed.
