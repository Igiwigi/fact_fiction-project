Notes on Table XXIV.

1. The polarimeter results agree quite well among themselves and indicate that
concordant results may be expected in practice from the two methods.

2. The average of 15-7 gm. of mannitol from the polarimeter figures is 85 per cent.
of the “ carbon unaccounted for” (equivalent to 18-5 gm. mannitol). Hence Aspergillus
species Ac. 55 is much to be preferred to Aspergillus species Ac. 56 for mannitol production
since the corresponding figure for the latter mould is less than 50 per cent.

3. It will be seen that the figures obtained by the acetylation method (average 19-74)
are considerably higher than those given either by the polarimeter method (average
15-7) or by the carbon balance sheet (18°5). This is to be explained by the fact that
the solution was fermented by yeast after the carbon balance sheet had been prepared
but before the polarimeter and acetylation estimations. Hence the glycerol formed
during the fermentation of the residual glucose by yeast, which would amount to from 0-5
to 1 gm. in weight, is not included in the figure 18-5 obtained from the carbon balance
sheet. Since glycerol is not estimated by the polarimeter it will not be included in
the polarimeter figure (15-7), so that the acetylation figure should in any case be
from 0-5-1-0 higher than either the polarimeter or carbon balance sheet figures.

4. It is evident from the reasonable agreement between the figures obtained by the
different methods that almost all the “ carbon unaccounted for” is present as mannitol,
so that Aspergillus species Ac. 55 should be a satisfactory mould for mannitol production
since the product obtained will be in a reasonably pure condition and hence easier to
