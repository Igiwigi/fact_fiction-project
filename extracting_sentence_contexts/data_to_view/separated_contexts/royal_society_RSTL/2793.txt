Goapsy, of testing the truth of the opinions of these eminent physiologists by the aid
of his admirable microscope, I beg to lay before the Society the results of some in-

croscope, used by Mr, Goapsy in his able dissections of the anatomy of insects, on
the field of which a minute portion of perfectly recent muscle is placed, which has
been detached from the mass by means of a lancet, or a fine pair of curved scissars.
