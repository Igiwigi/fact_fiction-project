be morphologically different. The importance of the two hemispheres is such that
a detailed description of each is necessary.

Q.1905.R. (Plate 28)—The occipital operculum (18) is seen as a crescentic folding
of the cortex extending from the medial to the lateral border of the hemisphere.
It separates the occipital region from the parietal region except for a narrow strip
of cortex lying between the lower end of the opercular sulcus and the sulcus occi-
pitalis inferior, The sulcus lying under the operculum is deep and complex.
Superiorly it lies immediately posterior to the fissura parieto-occipitalis (21) ;
inferiorly it ends in a backwardly curved sulcus lying anterior to, and partly
surrounding, a typical Y-shaped sulcus calcarinus externus (19). The latter sulcus
is accompanied by accessory external calcarine sulci. The calcarine group of sulci
is folded horizontally. Many features go to establish the fact that this large oper-
cular sulcus is homologous with the “ Affenspalte ’’—the clear definition of the sulcus
calcarinus externus, the identification in its correct topographical relations of the
sulcus praelunatus (18), the upward extension of the operculum, almost covering
the fissura parieto-occipitalis, and finally, the submergence of the sulcus occipitalis
transversus under the operculum. The operculum belongs to the type frequently

seen in the brain of the Chimpanzee and is homologous with the sulcus described
by some writers as the fissura perpendicularis externa. I am unable to find any
reference to so extensive an operculum in the human brain.
