A physicist who believed that the size of the black hole at tp can be determined from the space—
time geometry in some neighbourhood of .#* at to would be faced with a dilemma. Somehow, :
the black hole would have to ‘know’ to be the right size at fo in order to anticipate the decay or =
non-decay of the atom, or alternatively the experimenter decision, at t;. The apparent dilemma 3
is compounded by the fact that the photons which propagate on .#* never interact with the
radioactive atom (or experimenter) at f;. To avoid requiring some implausible conspiracy, the nee)
physicist may conclude that there may be a retrocausal effect by which information, associated :
with the decay of the radioactive atom, propagates back in time causing the black hole event [4
horizon to expand at earlier times. DN

However, in this case, there is a simple explanation for the correlation which requires neither [sz
conspiracy nor retrocausality. The explanation lies in the fact that #+ is defined by a global :&
property of space-time, it being the boundary of null surfaces that escape to .%*. Consistent .
with this, the location r(to) of #* cannot be determined by the geometry of space-time in
the neighbourhood of * at fo. Hence, the correlation is explainable without conspiracy or
retrocausality.

3. Global invariant sets in state space

Instead of the global geometric constructions in space-time, we now consider global geometric
constructions in state space.

Consider a dynamical system D : X;, > X}+1, defined, say, by a set of differential equations
X =F[X]. An attracting invariant set Ip is a closed subset of the state space of D with the
