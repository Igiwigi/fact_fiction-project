Mean values are

thus fairly steady, and may be treated as independent of conditions of sampling for all
“practical purposes. The standard deviations (and hence coefficients of variations) are,
“Showever, entirely different for ‘free’ and ‘non-free’ samples. In fact, for ‘free’ sampling
2the coefficient of variation decreases with increasing values of the binomial proportion, while
ait is practically constant in the case of ‘non-free’ samples. The position is something inter-
Smediate in the case of ‘ partially free’ samples, and it is found that the coefficient of variation
Edecreases with increasing values of /, but more slowly than in the case of ‘free’ samples.

8 181. The above results make it possible to test the random or non-random nature of
binomial linear fields or binomial time series without any difficulty.
