same independent variables as 7) equal to the function which is reciprocal to J with
regard to p, Cand H, These three vectors may be [$35] called velocities, and thus
d is in value the reciprocal of 7 with regard to all the velocities involved in the latter. Adopting now the notation of § 33 and its assumption (end of § 33), we have

1+\= 2t= —(D,p?+ SO,Vi+SBH/47). .. . . (11)

That J, the Lagrangian function (per unit volume), and A, the free energy, should be
reciprocal functions (in value only) with regard to the velocities they contain, is
in accord with the fact (but not deducible from it) that a similar statement is true
for an ordinary dynamical system [§ 33, eq. (1) above}. Let now A stand for the part of the free energy due to a finite portion of matter. Required A.
