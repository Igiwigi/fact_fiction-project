Norway.—As mentioned before, Mr. Ktarr published in 1885 (see his essay in the ‘25 Anniversaire
de la Société de Statisque,’ Paris, 1886, p. 107) quinquennial natalities, based on the age-combinations
which he observed by tabulating a fragment of the 1875 census cards (that is, 30,000 families). The
births refer to the years 1874-76, thus, to two years after, but only one before the census, Taking
the tenfold of the figures resulting from the tabulation of the 30,000 families, we obtain the following
absolute figures for the whole kingdom: 15-19 years, 1490 wives and 393 births; 20-24 years
15,360 wives and 6611 births; 25-29 years, 32,810 wives and 13,032 births; 30-34 years, 38,330 wives
2 and 13,377 births; 35-39, 35,840 wives and 10,598 births; 40-44, 36,740 wives and 6586 births;
D> 45-49, 35,700 wives and 1452 births.

Ro! Mr. Kiser makes on this occasion the just remark that on this base we ought to obtain probabilities
inferior to the reality, in consequence of the fact that the couples married in the year of the census
unduly enlarge the numerator. He therefore undertakes to correct the figures in an approximate
way. Thus, he obtains the following corrected probabilities: 15-19, 41°3 (instead of 264) ; 20-24,
, 51-9 (43°) ; 25-29, 43° (39°7); 30-34, 36° (349); 35-39, 30° (29°6); 40-44, 18:1 (179); 45-49,
: 33 (32). Mr. Kiser mentions in his letter that, in consequence of an error in method, the
probabilities grew somewhat too high, but that this is counterbalanced in some way by the fact that
13 per cent. of the births are wanting. We have further to mention that the author calculated the
probabilities only for those quinquennial groups in which he could observe at least 2000 families.
The probabilities for the married wives of Denmark have been calculated by the Danish Statistical
Office in the ‘ Vielser, Foedsler og Dodsfald i aarene,’ 1880-89 (Kjébenhavn, 1893), p. 13, and refer to
- the legitimate births of 1878-82.
For the calculation of the natality in Alsace and Lorraine, I used—as mentioned above—the statis-
; tical data contained in Mr. Wituetm Srrepa’s ‘Das Sexualverhiiltniss der Geborenen’ (Strassburg,
