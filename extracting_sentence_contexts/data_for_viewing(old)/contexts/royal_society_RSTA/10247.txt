In the case of A = 0, & vanishes; K_ also vanishes and so also does the angle B. Hence we have
e=(cos?B, n=¢
With these values, equation (35) becomes
(Ai — Ax?) [cos? y + (A+ ¢) cos® B] = (Ay! — Ai!) [3 + (A+ ¢) + cos? y].

Hence ¢ plays the part of an augmentation to A,
With A = 0 the equation assumes the form

(Ai — Ay!) (cos? y + ¢ cos? B) = (Ai!- Ai) (3+¢4 cos?y). 2 . 2. 1.

It follows therefore that an infinitesimal satellite revolving about an oblate planet, whose rotation is the
same as the revolution of the satellite, is very nearly identical in form with a small but finite satellite
whose mass is a fraction of a spherical planet expressed by ¢. This curious conclusion follows from the fact
that if we take equation (35) and put ¢ and » zero (which corresponds to a spherical planet and small
satellite), we get exactly the equation ()) just found, only with A in place of ¢
