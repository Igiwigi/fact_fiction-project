Naturally the existence of a variability of this kind makes it very difficult to find
out what is the real effect of changing the controllable conditions, and the author has
spent a great deal of time in trying to get rid of it. In this he has been unsuccessful. It looks, in fact, as though this variability is in some way or another an inherent
part of the phenomena. In some respects it seems to follow definite laws. It is
more marked at high than at low pressures, and at low than at high temperatures.
