~ indv B pre-selection measure of the number of different sequences we can expect to

& 0.08 find at different stages of B-cell development (figure 8). The
2 0.06 generation entropy can be broken down into contributions
s from the different events that make up the recombination scen-
s 0.04 ario. Most of the diversity comes from insertions. Note that the
entropy of rearranged sequences is smaller than the entropy of

0.02 recombination events. This is due to convergent recombin-
ationâ€”the fact that a given sequence can be produced by

0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 different recombination scenarios. Individual B has larger gen-
length of CDR3 (amino acids) eration entropy than individual A, primarily because it has

more insertions. The entropy of productive sequences is
further reduced (by two bits) by keeping only the in-frame
sequences. Subsequent action of selection reduces the diversity
of the repertoire by about 10 bits. This reduction is true for
both individuals, regardless of their different generation
entropy, and follows from the correlation between Ppre and
Q (figure 7b), which concentrates the distribution towards
the most probable rearrangements, thus reducing diversity in
