in order, and submitted to a comparative examination.

The Stalk of the Sporangium.

A part of the sporangium which deserves more attention than it has yet received
is the stalk. It is well known that some sporangia are sessile, others borne on long
stalks ; that some stalks are thick and others thin; but it remains to submit them to
a general comparison, and to place the facts observed in their relation to such features
as the mass of the sporangium, its output of spores, and the mechanism of dehiscence
as it may be influenced by neighbouring sporangia.

Omitting for the purpose of this comparison all synangial sori, the short thick.
stalk of the single sporangium as seen in Angiopteris will form one extreme of the
series; at the other extreme, as showing the greatest simplicity of structure, lie
those of the Leptosporangiate Ferns in which the whole sporangium is derived from
a single papillar cell; if this undergo at first transverse segmentation, the stalk will
consist, in part at least, of only a single-rowed filament of cells; this is actually the
case in many Ferns, for instance in Scolopendrium vulgare.* Between these extremes
lie many Ferns which bridge over the difference by almost imperceptible steps.
