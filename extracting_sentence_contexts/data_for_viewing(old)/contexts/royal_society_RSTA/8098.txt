THEOREM V.—In the general two-dimensional problem, the points of the membrane
at which the pressure p has maximum and minimum values are situated on a cirele whose

centre is the centre of rotation of the tooth, and whose radius is equal to the radius of
gyration about that centre of rotation of a fictitious wire coincident with the section of the
membrane by the plane of the displacement, and having a linear density equal to the cube
of the reciprocal of the thickness of the membrane.

The points of maximum pressure are distinguished from the points of minimum pressure
by the fact that at a point of maximum pressure, the tooth approaches the socket as a result
of the displacement, while at a point of minimum pressure. the tooth recedes from the socket.

These results are illustrated in fig. 5, in which the arrows indicate the directions in
which the pressure increases.

If the displacement of the tooth is a pure translation, we cannot choose the origin
at the centre of rotation, which is at infinity. Jt is convenient to choose the origin
temporarily at the centre of mass of the fictitious wire, so that by (70)
