were kept. The lines produced are nearly straight at either temperature, showing
that the loss of weight is almost proportional to saturation deficiency and therefore
due to evaporation. It is also apparent that more weight is lost at 24° than at 30° C.
This is probably due to the fact that the weights were taken at the end of puparial
life, on the 31st day in the case of those puparia at 24° and on the 20th day in those at
30° C. It is possible to allow for the differences in time by calculating the product of

This expression gives a “standardized loss.”
