And so, orang-utan surplus
nest-making procedures are currently resisting an ordinary
explanation and might therefore create symbolic meaning. Yet, these orang-utan nest sounds may also be too soft to
serve as a communicative function to others, unless these
others are nearby (but then they can actually see that the sub-
ject is finishing a nest).'* At two well-studied sites, all
individuals studied virtually always perform these sounds
when they build their big evening nest, regardless of whether
they are in association with infants or others [50]. The fact
that these behaviours seemingly are performed primarily
individualistically, i.e. without a social goal, fails to support
the view that the sound is symbolic (unless we would allow
for private symbols; more on this below).

5. Discussion

Even when a specifically derived, stripped-down, minimal (ape)
ritual definition is applied, there is as yet no clear, unequivocal,
full-blown evidence for any spontaneous minimal ritual in non-
enculturated, untrained apes. Furthermore, even the single
necessary core components of the minimal ritual definition,
namely symbolism and copying, seem largely absent in apes
(with the possible exception of some basic, but frequent,
result-matching).
