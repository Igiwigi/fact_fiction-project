Ihe facts just referred to, any gain of Nitrogen in connexion with the plant, without

Athero being a larger quantity of Nitrogen in the plant itself than that provided in the

Saoed, would be very questionable evidence upon which to establish the fact of the assi-

=milation of free Nitrogen.

I But the results obtained with Graminacez in 1858, when all possible sources of error

Swhich the experience of the previous year had suggested had been eliminated, point,

-Swithout exception, to the fact that, under the circumstances of growth to which the plants

Swere 8ubjected, no assimilation of free Nitrogen has taken place. The regular process

ES cell-formation has gone on; carbonic acid has been decomposed, and carbon and the

Selements of water have been transformed into cellulose ; the plants have drawn the nitro-

Sgenous compounds from the older cells to perform the mysterious office of the formation

Eof new cells (see Notes on growth, Appendix, pp. 559, 561); those parts have been deye-

Aloped which required the smallest amount of Nitrogen ; and all the stages of growth
