Supertartrate of potash occasions an effervescence, when mixed in snbstance with
a solution of the sesquicarbonate, but not of the carbonate of soda ; and the effect
is similar, whether the mixture be made over mercury, air excluded, or in an open
vessel exposed to the atmosphere. The supertartrate of potash also, I find, mixed
with blood and agitated with common air, acts as with the sesquicarbonate, and oc-
casions a disengagement of air, and both from arterial and venous blood, and from
serum ; and the air I haye ascertained is carbonic acid. From these facts, may it not be inferred that the alkali in the blood, in its normal
or healthiest condition, is neither in the state of carbonate nor of bicarbonate, but of
sesquicarbonate? The power of the blood to absorb carbonic acid and sulphuretted
hydrogen accords best with this view, and some other important properties of the
fluid are, I believe, in harmony with it. The sesquicarbonate, I may add, seems to be the state of rest of the alkali in com-
bination with carbonic acid, under ordinary cireumstances of exposure to the atmo-
sphere.*
