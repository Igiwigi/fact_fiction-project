ON A SYSTEM OF FUNCTIONAL DYNAMICS AND OPTICS 181

The limits of integration of the double integral over the surface S are the lines L,
and L. This possibility of connecting the functional forces (97) with electric current
should be compared with the system (43)-(49), but it should hardly be necessary
to add that the system (97) has been considered only to illustrate the possibilities of
the method.

The above formulation of functional dynamics is put forward tentatively, for it
still remains to be seen that all the difficulties of notation have been removed. There
is at least one attractive possibility. In I (p. 21) the generalization of the Porsson
brackets appropriate to the system of ยง 2 was introduced, but on account of the fact
that these new brackets involve three variables, it is difficult to understand how they
could possibly be used as the basis of a quantum algebra (of electromagnetism con-
nected with the atomicity of electric charge). On the other hand, with the system
here proposed, using functional variables, this problem would be removed and the
uncertainty relations obtained in I (p. 26) could be expressed by means of brackets
involving only two variables, and therefore suitable for the definition of the algebraic
operation of multiplication.

With a view to physical understanding of the independent functional variable, it
is desirable to remove the vagueness inherent in the above formalism by referring
once again to the ideas which prompted the whole investigation.
