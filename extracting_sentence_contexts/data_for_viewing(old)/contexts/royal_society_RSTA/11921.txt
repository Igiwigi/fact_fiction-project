k derivatives of the same hydrocarbon have the same ratio of the specific heats.
Similarly it appears that the equality of y for the two propyl chlorides is not an
lated fact, for two other pairs of isomeric bodies, viz., ethylene and etbylidene
jorides and methyl acetate and ethyl] formate prove to have the same y. As | have
entioned above, there is some doubt about the results for the two last mentioned,
it at present the balance of evidence is in favour of the statement that isomeric com-
yds have the same y.
Tn the case of the paraffins ethane and propane, it was shown in my former paper
at one H can be replaced by a halogen without altering the value of y, but that the
roduction of a halogen into methane causes a fall in y. We see now that the
aturated gas ethylene behaves in the same way as methane, for the y of vinyl
mide is markedly lower than that of ethylene. Thus the possibility of inter-
nge of hydrogen with a halogen without altering y is not general, a fact that is
ught out still more clearly by a consideration of the higher substitution products.
It was shown by Srrecker* that hydrochloric, hydrobromic and hydriodie acids
have nearly the same y us hydrogen, namely 1°4, whilst the y's of chlorine, bro-
Biine, iodine and iodine chloride all lie near 1°3. Hence in this case one halogen can
e put in the place of hydrogen without affecting y, but the introduction of a second
ogen causes a large fall.
The paraffin derivatives show the same feature. he second Cl introduced into the
e invariably causes a large fall in y whether the first has done so or not.
us, whilst ethyl chloride has the same y as ethane, ethylene and ethylidene
lovides are 4 per cent. lower.
The methune substitution products are volatile enough to allow the whole series to
