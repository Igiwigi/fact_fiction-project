Non-trivial solutions of (3.3) are obtained by setting det(A) = 0, which yields

{[ mo? - 24e)(1 - cos(kL)) | [low*L - 4E)(2 + cos(kL)) — 144(E])? sin?(k1)}
~ 2 {hot [ma - 24E](1 - cos(kt)) |} =0. (3.5)

The equation above represents the dispersion relation of the system, which gives the
eigenfrequencies w of the structure as functions of the wavenumber k. When the spinners do not
spin (2 = 0), the dispersion relation has double roots. This is due to the fact that the cross-sections
of the beams have been assumed to possess the same second moments of area about the x- and
y-axes.

(b) Dispersion curves

We assume that the beams have Young’s modulus E = 210 GPa, length L = 6 m and square cross-
section of side length 0.1 m, as in the example of §2a. For the gyroscopic spinners, we take m=
1kg, Ip = 20kg m? and I, =10kg m?. The solid lines in figure 5a—d represent the dispersion curves
of the system for different values of the gyricity 2, specified in the caption.
