Determination of the Harmonic Function H,. A harmonic function is determinate when known on two contours provided that it
is holomorphic. In the present case the experimentally determined value of H on a
contour enclosing the ellipse together with the fact that H is zero at infinity, the presence
and effect of the walls being ignored, served to define H, throughout the field, for as
the flow of fluid past the elliptic cylinder is symmetrical, there is no circulation and H
is a function, single valued and asymmetric with respect to the Ox axis. By means of a conformal transformation the value of H, on the boundary ellipse
was found from that on the contour, and applying a method due to Barrstow,* a
suitable distribution of sources and sinks was found on the boundary satisfying the
boundary value of H,, and necessarily satisfying the contour value, such that by a
single integration of this distribution round the boundary the value of H, could be
determined at any desired point of the field. y
