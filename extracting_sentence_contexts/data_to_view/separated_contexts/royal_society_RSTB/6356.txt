The precise nature of the ‘‘male” and ‘“‘female’’ hormones concerned in sexual
differentiation has not, to our knowledge, been demonstrated. Such male hormones
as were used on the animals we studied were apparently without effect on the hydatids
of Morgagni, whereas they caused profound changes in organs derived from the
Wolffian duct. This result is in keeping with present knowledge of embryonic develop-
ment, and with the fact that none of the male hormones we used has any marked
oestrogenic activity. Furthermore, the refractoriness of the hydatids to male hormone
suggests that such differentiation as some of these appendages display in post-uterine
life (e.g. O.M. 18) must have been effected, independently of endocrine influence,
during the sexually indifferent phase of embryonic life. For, as is widely believed, male
hormone is normally produced relatively earlier by genotypic male embryos than
female hormone is by genotypic female embryos, and once the endocrine environment
has become masculine in character the Miillerian ducts begin to retrogress, and no
further differentiation is possible.
