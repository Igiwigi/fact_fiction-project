vaccine responses in malnourished children references

diphtheria, tetanus, Most studies report good seroconversion rates; affinity or titre of vaccine responses [33-37]
pertussis (DTP) may be affected

hepatitis B (HepB) good seroconversion; conflicting data on antibody titres [38,39]

rabies no relationship between measures of malnutrition and response to vaccine [40]

typhoid (killed) similar antibody response to well-nourished children, although generation of vaccine [34,41-45]

Tesponse may be delayed
in two trials, antibody responses to typhoid vaccine reported to be augmented
