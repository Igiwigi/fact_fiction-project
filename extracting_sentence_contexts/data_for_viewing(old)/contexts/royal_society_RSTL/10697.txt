Note on the preceding Paper, by Professor G. G. SToxxs, P.R.S.
(Received January 14, 1886.)

The consistency of Mr. TowL1x80N's different determinations of the coefficient of
viscosity of air, notwithstanding the great variation in the cireumstances of the experi-
ments, and the consistency with one another of the numbers got by a different
process by MAxweLL, led me to endeayour to make ont the real cause of the differ-
ence, and I think the main part, ab any rate, of ib can be explained by a yery natural
supposition.

The fact that Mr. TowLixsoN worked with air in its ordinary state, whereas
MaxweiL's air was dry, even if ib tends in the right direction, would evidently not
go nearly far enough. But it occurred to me that the effect of any error of level in
the movable disks employed by MAXWELL must have been much greater than might
at first 8ight appear. For suppose a very 8mall error 6 to exist, and suppose the fixed
disks adjusted to be parallel to the moyable ones in the position of equilibrium of the
latter. Then the two systems must be, very nearly indeed, parallel] throughout the
motion, since the angle of oscillation of the movable disks to one side or other of the
position of equilibrium is very s8mall. If 2% be the whole amplitude, the greatest
error of paralleligm will be of the order 6, and it would naturally appear at first gight
that the effect of 80 small an error of parallelizgm must be insignificant for any 8veh
error of level as we can reasonably suppose to have existed. But a little consideration
will show that this need not be the case when the distance between the fixed and
