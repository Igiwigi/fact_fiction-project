others did not. A recent meta-analysis of 417 plant species
found overall support for pollination syndromes [105]. Note-
worthy trends emerging from a wealth of studies indicate
that generalization is widespread, with a majority of plants
associated with multiple pollinator groups and vice versa.
Many floral traits, including colour, are continuous rather
than discrete variables, making compartmentalization of
flowers and pollinators into discrete syndromes problematic.
For night-blooming flowers, several studies have reported
that those pollinated by moths tend to be white, creamish
or yellowish, and that bat-pollinated flowers are creamish
in colour, pendulous, have stout pedicels or brush-like sta-
mens [89], although there are several exceptions. In fact, the
nocturnal carpenter bee, Xylocopa tranquebarica does not
appear to show any specific association with floral colours
and can collect pollen and nectar from both night-opening
pale flowers and day-opening blue, violet or pink flowers
as well as from flowers of various shapes and sizes. This
nocturnal bee also makes visits by night to flowers that
open during the day (and are brightly coloured) in the
Asian tropics in Thailand and India [106,107]. The nocturnal
Panamanian sweat bee Megalopta also visits flowers that are
visited by bats [108] and are flower generalists, and have
been shown to collect pollen from more than 40 plant species
that either had diurnal or nocturnal anthesis [109]. This gen-
