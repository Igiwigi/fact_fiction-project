In some cases,
failure may just occur on the up-dip megathrust or decollement itself, and the overlying prism
may behave as a more-or-less rigid block. But in other cases, failure will occur within the prism
itself, leading to crustal thickening or thinning accommodated by faulting and folding. Or even
normal faulting if gravitational stresses dominate, despite the fact that the stress loading part of
the cycle was compressionalâ€”examples of this may be normal ruptures during the M9+ 2011
Tohoku megathrust Earthquake [68], and the M7.8 2016 Kaikoura reverse strike-slip event [26]. This behaviour may approximate to that described by critical taper theory for a Coulomb wedge,
or some type of plastic flow in response to the total stress field. An interesting question in this respect is why the short-term deformation along the subduction
margin part of the New Zealand plate boundary zone is similar to the long term, whereas in the
Andes it is not, given both can be well modelled in the same way by locking on the megathrust or a
deep decollement, ignoring surface faulting.
