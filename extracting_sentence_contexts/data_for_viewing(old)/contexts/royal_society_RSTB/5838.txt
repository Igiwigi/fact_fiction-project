The rate of growth (increase in length) is very variable in vitro, but is probably
always considerably slower than im vivo. The stage of differentiation attained by an
embryo is very largely independent of the absolute size, and, if a blastoderm is explanted
at an early age and thus is affected by the slowing of the growth rate for the greater
part of its life, embryos may be formed which, compared with the normal, are very much
too small for their stages of differentiation. Thus an embryo cultivated for 72 hours
after a preliminary incubation for 2 hours, has some 18-20 somites, although its length
is only about 2 mm., whereas the normal length for such a stage should be about 5-3 mm.
(from Litiieâ€™s table). It cannot be decided, with the material at hand, whether the
slowing of the growth rate is greater if the blastoderm is transplanted at an early stage,
or whether the marked effects seen in such embryos is entirely due to the fact that the
slower rate of growth has been in action for a greater proportion of the total life. It
can be seen that the embryo shown in Plate 22 has grown remarkably little during
the 32 hours covered by the series of photographs. The normal in vitro development
of the duck appears to be similar to that of the chick, in that only rather unimportant
modifications are caused by the abnormal environment.

3. Location of the Presumptive Organ-forming Materials in the early Blastoderm of the
Chick.

The work of Werzet (1925, 1929) and Graper (1929) enables one to fix, at least in
a provisional manner, the location of the organ-forming materials in the early stages of
the blastoderm. Werrze. has provided four figures (fig. 124-127, p. 313 of 1929 paper)
