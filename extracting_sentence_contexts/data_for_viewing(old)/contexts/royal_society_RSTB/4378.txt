SKULL FOUND AT TALGAI, QUEENSLAND. 363

(asterion), is an admirable one for practical purposes, since these two points are
accurately determinable and are comparatively uninjured in the Talgai skull.

From investigations on many crania, including Australians, Melanesians, Euro-
peans, ete., I can support Kerrn’s statements as to the approximation of this line
to the base line of the cerebrum, and its value as a horizon for the determination of
differences in cranial form. The results of superposing an orthogonal projection of
the left side of the Talgai brain-case on similar projections of modern Australians
published by TurNER (4), Berry and Ropertson (5), and Kiaarscx (6), reveal two
very important facts. Fig. 25 (p. 8384) shows the result of such a superposition of
the Talgai tracing on that of Skull 16 in Brrry’s collection. In the first place, the
nature of the distortion in the occipital region and the basis cranii is rendered very
obvious. Together with some loss of substance in the squama occipitalis and much
fissuring of this and the nuchal and basal portions, the whole bone has been dislocated
into an abnormal position upwards, so that even had the inion been recognisable on
the bone it would have had no value in so far as its position in the whole skull is.
concerned. In the second place, the confirmation of the identification of the sites
of the coronal, parieto-temporal, and lambdoid sutures is very striking, and is further
evidence that no great distortion exists on this side, except in the regions previously
mentioned.

The method of superposing dioptographic tracings which was used in fig. 13 has
