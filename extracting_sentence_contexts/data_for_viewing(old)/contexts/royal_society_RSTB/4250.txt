prevomers in Emys and Crocodiles, but that as the approach to a mammalian
condition seen in those reptiles is dependent on a great reduction of the paraseptal
cartilages, the apparent resemblance to the mode of origin of the mammalian vomer
is probably deceptive. This view of the origin of the mammalian yomer is also
supported by the paired origin of that bone in many forms.

of bony splints having exactly the same relation to the paraseptal cartilages as the

prevomers of a lizard. This fact seems to demonstrate the strict homology of these
two bones. As in this embryo (as Prof. Witson has shown) a definite palatal
process of the premaxilla is also present, these bones cannot be interpreted merely as
parts of that bone.

87. The occurrence in Embryo 8 of Ornithorhynchus of a definite and large
mammalian vomer having no connection with and lying in a different plane from
that of the os paradoxum shows that this bone cannot be the fused prevomers.

38. The actual relation of the anterior end of the vomer in Macropus and
Dasyurus to the paraseptal cartilage is not that which we should expect if that bone
be really the fused prevomers, but appears to be a secondary one.
