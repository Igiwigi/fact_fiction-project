Usually the determinations at Cerro yielded a more alkaline figure, but
only more alkaline by a very trifling amount, on the average about 0°2 pH. In
making the calculations, there is the assumption that the constant pK, in Hasselbalch’s
formula has the same value in the case of the blood both at sea-level and at Cerro. This, however, would not necessarily be the case if the corpuscular content were
markedly different, as in fact it was. TasLe VII.—Corrected pH Figures. CO, | Free CO,* Combined |
