because of its larger decay exponent. We ought to make sure that the energy input occurs at
wavenumbers sufficiently far away from the dissipative range; otherwise, a substantial decay
could occur directly at the energy-containing scale itself. Furthermore, the length scale should
not grow to be a substantial fraction of the computational box. These are often conflicting
requirements, and only a few runs of table 1 satisfy these conditions, even if only approximately.
We shall focus on just those cases here. Particularly relevant is the role of the postulate on the
permanence of large eddies [50].

A quick examination of table 1 suggests that cases 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.14 and 1.15 have the best
chance of retaining high enough in Reynolds number for the «4 cases. Likewise, 2.6, 2.7, 2.9, 2.14
and 2.15 appear to be the most suitable among the x? cases.

The second criterion is based on the fact that the energy-containing scales must be distinct from
the viscous-dominated scales of turbulence; in other words, xp should be far enough to the left of
the dissipative region. For box turbulence for which the lowest resolved wavenumber kmin = 1,
