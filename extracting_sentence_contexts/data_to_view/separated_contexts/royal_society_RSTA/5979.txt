To show these conditions, it is suitable to decompose H = KN @K, where KN is the finite-
dimensional subspace generated by

Qi, j,k, |, m) = (sin ix, sin jx, sinkx, cos lx,cosmx) 1<1i,j,k,lm<N. It is worth noting that CN is invariant under the semigroup and the solutions starting in this
subspace always belong to it. In fact, a solution U(t) can be written as Uj(t) + U2(t), where
Ui (t) â‚¬ KN and Un(t) EK. We first study the solution U;(t) and we note that, since KN is finite-
dimensional, to prove the exponential decay of solutions, it is sufficient to see that all the
eigenvalues have negative real part. Proposition 3.3.
