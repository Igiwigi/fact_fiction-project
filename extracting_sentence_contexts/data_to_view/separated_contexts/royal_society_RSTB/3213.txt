THOMAS ON THE STRUCTURE OF

In such stems we have not met with any indications of branching, either externally
or in the steles. It would thus seem probable that the specimens described
here are, in reality, the upper portions of stems, not very remote from the
apices, for we know that the trunks of many Eusigillariz attained to a very
considerable diameter. The fact that the stems were ribbed, and that the ribs are in reality of cortical
origin and quite independent of the leaf-bases, suggests that, despite apparent
exceptions, the two-fold classification proposed by Wess, namely, Eusigillarize and
Subsigillarize, may be a natural one. The presence of a ligule tends to emphasise still further the close relationship of
the Sigillarize to other Paleozoic Lycopods. This view is now so generally accepted
that it is unnecessary here to combat BronentArtâ€™s* correlation of this genus with
the Gymnosperms.
