This fituation of the ſtrata may be
not unaptly repreſented in the following manner. Let a number of leaves of paper, of ſeveral different
ſorts or colours, be paſted npon one another ; then
bending them up together into a ridge in the middle,
conceive them to be reduced again to-a level ſurface,
by a plane ſo pafling through them, as to cut off all
the part that had been raiſed ; let the middle now be
again raiſed a little, and this will be a good general
repreſentation of moſt, if not. of all, large tra&ts of
mountainous countries, together with the parts ad-
Jacent, throughout the whole world. *,

low, that we ought to mect with the ſame kinds of
earths, ſtones, and minerals, appearing at the ſurface,
in long narrow flips, and lying parallel to the greateſt
riſe of any long ridges of mountains ; and fo, in fact,
we find them. The Andes in South America, as it
has been faid before, have a chain of volcanos, that
extend in length above 5000 miles: theſe volcanos,
in all probability, are all derived from the + fame

out of ſtrata ſtill lower than the reſt, which, perhaps, may always
be the caſe, where they have volcanos in. them, [See a repre-
ſentation of this in Tab, XIII. Fig. 3.] In other inſtances, how-
ever, it often happens, that the hilk, to -which theſe high lands
ſerve as a baſe, are not only formed out of the ſtrata next above
them, | but they ſtand, as it were, ina diſh, as.if they had depreſſed
the ground, on which they reſt, by their weight.

* Fig. 1. repreſents a ſeQtion of a ſett of ftrata, lying in the
ſituation juſt deſcribed: the ſeQion is ſuppoſed to be made at right
angles to the lepgth of the ridge, and perpendicular to the ho-
xizon.
