Table 1 shows the numerical
value of the slope f (obtained by the best linear fit) and its theoretical prediction (6.9) for both
bifurcations, at comax and comin, Where a is computed numerically. There is a mismatch of
approximately 1% at the second bifurcation, at comin. This mismatch is probably due to the fact
that a in theorem 5.3 cannot be computed at the precise value of dl, in the numerical set-up. The theoretical prediction f; at the first bifurcation at co max is less accurate in comparison to
the numerical value of f (although it has the same order of magnitude). This is likely caused by
the fact that the solitary travelling wave is rather wide at the bifurcation (recall that the solitary
waves delocalize when c approaches the sonic limit c; = 1, as illustrated in figure 2), and Le,
and £7e9 are not precisely in the kernel of £, causing an error in computing « and therefore
f;.
