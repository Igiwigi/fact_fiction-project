On these same mounds we can sometimes distinguish those
fragments which have been washed by the little waves of the ancient waters, from
others which have since fallen; and at Loch Treig, at the height of 972 feet above
the sea, the tide-scooped rocks appear as if scarcely a century had elapsed since they
were washed by the ripple of the eddying currents. The preservation of the druidical
mounds in Britain has often been adduced as a circumstance worthy of attention ;

but here during a period which cannot be reckoned by thousands of years, but only
by those great revolutions of nature which are the effects of slow and scarcely sen-
sible changes, works smaller than those ancient ones dedicated to superstition, retain
each outline nearly as perfect as when first formed by the hand of nature. These facts are interesting under another point of view, for they prove to us that
we may trust the plain inference of our experiences. Although we see#* the stone of
many ancient buildings decaying and crumbling away, yet we know that others, as
the obelisks of Egypt, have lasted more than three thousand years, with the hiero-
glyphics nearly perfect on them : now we cannot see any reason why their general
outline, even in points of detail, should not last a hundred times three thousand years.
