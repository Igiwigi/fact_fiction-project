A saturated s0lution of
picric acid in absolute alcohol to some extenb obviates this difficulty, but it is not
80 8uccessful as a saturated watery solution, although it appears to be a valuable
reagent for ordinary work. With regard to other manipulative details, it is, as mentioned above, important to
cut up the material into 8mall pieces, and also to place it at once upon cutting in the
preservative medium. My usual plan, in fact, was to cub off the pulvini and allow
them to drop, then and there, into picric acid, in order to avoid any loss of water due to
evaporation, which as far as delicate investigations are concerned will s00n very gravely
affect the whole cell-equilibrium. After treatment with picric acid for about 24 hours
the material is removed, rapidly washed with water, and placed in alcohol, the latter
being changed until the yellow coloration of the picric acid is no longer obtained. Any method of preservation is, however, very imperfect.
