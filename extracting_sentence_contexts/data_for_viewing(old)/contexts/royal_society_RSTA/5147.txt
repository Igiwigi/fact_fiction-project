Semi-active control of wind turbines has been explored by Arrigan et al. [22,23] to suppress
the vibrations by using semi-active TMDs. The control algorithm is based on a short-time Fourier
transform and retuning the damper to track the dominant/natural frequencies of the structural
system. Control of both edgewise and flapwise vibrations has been investigated.

Recently, the issue of structural and mechanical vibrations in wind turbines due to the
occurrence of electrical grid faults has been analysed by Basu et al. [24] and Staino et al. [25].
The study [24,25] indicated that the effect of electrical grid faults may propagate through the
mechanical subsystem of the turbine and cause major structural vibrations. The application of :
custom power devices to counteract the effect of grid fault-induced vibration is considered in :=

the study. Numerical results show that flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS) Sy
devices and unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) in particular are successful in mitigating a
vibrations due to electrical faults, and they can be conveniently applied to stabilize the generator aed
shaft speed, drive train oscillations, edgewise blade vibrations and tower responses. : _

passive control of floating wind turbine nacelle and spar vibrations using multiple TMDs has
been investigated by Dinh & Basu [29]. In an overview of floating offshore wind turbines [30], the
