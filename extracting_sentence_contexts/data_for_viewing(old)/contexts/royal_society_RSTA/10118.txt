wave, it must be remembered, shows a phase angle which varies largely with the
season of the year, but the differences between the phase angles observed in 1862-4
and 1898-1904 are in most months comparatively small. If, then, the reduction in the
amplitude apparent in the later series is due to some disturbing cause, that cause
must have itself a phase which nearly keeps step with that of the real 24-hour
potential wave throughout the year.

Before attaching much importance to views which after all are mainly theoretical,
it should be remembered that the older Kew data refer to all days, the later only to
fair weather conditions. Future investigations may show the 24-hour term to be
more dependent on the meteorological conditions than the 12-hour term, /Also in
considering the relative importance of the two terms we should make allowance for
the fact that it is the conditions close to the ground that are at present of most
immediate practical importance both to human beings and to agriculture.

§ 15. Returning to the consideration of Tables VIII. and IX., it will be seen that
with the exception of the values of «, in winter—when the amplitude at Kew was
so small that considerable uncertainty must exist—the Kew and Bureau Central
values of a, and @, are sufficiently close to raise a strong presumption that the 8- and
6-hour terms represent a true atmospheric electricity effect. The comparative
agreement between the phase angles from the earlier and later series of observations
at the Bureau Central and the Eiffel Tower favour the same conclusion.

The 8- and 6-hour waves are decidedly smaller at Kew than at the Bureau Central.
The difference in this case may not improbably be partly due to greater homogeneity
