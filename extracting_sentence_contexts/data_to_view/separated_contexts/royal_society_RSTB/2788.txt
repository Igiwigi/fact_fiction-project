The latter is
characteristic throughout of no great group, but appears to have originated
sporadically, it is therefore of only small account for systematic purposes. But the
enlargement of the leaf appears general in some groups, such as the Ferns and
Ophioglossacez, and, in a less degree, in the Sphenophylleee and Psilotaceze. The
comparisons given above show, moreover, that the complexity of the spore-producing
members in the homosporous Pteridophytes goes hand in hand with the complexity
of the leaves, a fact which readily finds its explanation on a basis of nutrition. Accordingly, if the size and complexity of the leaf be the basis, the groups would then
be arranged according to the characters of the most essential parts of the sporophyte. Following this method, the Ferns take their place at one extreme ; the small-leaved
types, as exemplified by the Equiseta and Lycopods, will occupy the other extreme
