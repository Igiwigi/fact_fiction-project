Ficures 10 to 12. Longitudinal sections of an isolated terminal region itr in which the apical cell
(ac, figure 10) has become necrosed, growth being carried on by means of a lateral bud (4,
figure 12). Leaf primordia of the original apex (pm, figures 10 and 11) have continued to grow,
but their vascular strands do not stand in any direct relation to the new lateral bud. Â£, pith.

an older leaf primordium of the original apex; while figure 12 shows the apex of the new
lateral bud. This bud apex was considerably smaller than the original apex, as were also
its constituent cells. In fact, these bud apices resemble those of young sporophyte plants. In
proximity to the necrosed apical cell, the tissues had undergone a characteristic paren-
chymatous development.

(d) The effect of three-quarter ringing

For comparison with the materials described above, the apex in some specimens was
only three-quarters ringed, i.e. two parallel vertical incisions and a third vertical incision
at right angles were made. The apical meristem had thus continuity of tissues, including
vascular tissue, on one side. The data for one specimen are illustrated in figures 13 to 15.
The isolated terminal region showed more development than the immediately adjacent
lateral bud. Whether or not this was due to the inhibition of the latter by the former after
