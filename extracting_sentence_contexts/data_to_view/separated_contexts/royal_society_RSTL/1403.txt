the period succeeding the last retreat of the waters. I do not
see why some of them may not also have fallen in during
that earlier period in\which the bears occupied the caves of
Germany, and the hyznas that in Yorkshire; for some of
the animals found at Kirkdale seem to agree in species with
those that occur in' the fissures ;' but as they are at the same
time not distinguishable from existing species, the argument
arising from” this resemblance-is/imperfect. The discovery
of the extinct elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, bear, and
hyzna in this breccia,”should it ever be made, would be
decisive of the question;'®

For an account” of the bones accumulated/in these fissures,
I must again refer to the works of M. Cuvies, which con-
tain more 's0und and clear” philosophical' reasoning on the
early tate of habitation'on our” planet, and a more valuable
collection of authentic facts relating to the history of its fossil
animals of the higher orders, than "can be found in all the
books that have ever yet been written on'the subject,

APPENDIX. Ir was mentioned, when speaking of Gailenreuth; that human
remains had been discovered there in the same'cave with the
bones of antediluvian animals, but that they are of compara-
tively low antiquity,

Three analogous 'cases have been noticed in this" country
in cavities of mountain lime-stone, at Burringdon, in' Somerset=
shire, and in Glamorganshire' and Caermarthenshire; and
these also are attended by circumstances which indicate them
to be of post-diluvian origin. 1.
