482 MR. C. H. LEES ON THE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITIES

Outline of Method.

The most important consideration in determining the method to be used is the fact
that it is difficult to get large pieces of the crystals to be experimented on. This
excludes methods requiring large plates, such as that of Wrper and Tuscumm, or
large spheres or cubes, such as that of KircHorr or THomson, A method which
seemed to present several advantages was the one first suggested by Lopen,* and
which may be called the “divided bar” method, and after some preliminary experi-
ments had been made to determine its suitability, it was finally adopted. It consists
in observing the temperature along a bar heated at one end and cooled at the other,
and divided halfway between the two ends by a plane perpendicular to its axis,
when (1) the divided ends are together, (2) a dise of the crystal or other body is
between.

If temperature observations are taken at several points in each half of the bar, the
