The paramagnetic chemical exchange saturation transfer (paraCEST) agents present an attractive
alternative to gadolinium-based agents for molecular imaging applications. Agents of this class
typically consist of a lanthanide ion chelated by a macrocyclic derivative of DOTA and the
contrast generated originates from the slow-to-intermediate exchange of the highly shifted
lanthanide-bound water molecule with bulk water [1,2]. Given the ability of lanthanide ions to
induce shifts in the resonances of proximate ligand protons, the exchange of highly shifted labile
protons of amides and alcohols has also proved to be an efficient way of generating CEST contrast
[3-5]. Eu>+ complexes of a variety of DOTA-tetraamide ligands have been most widely studied
as water exchange-based paraCEST agents. The reasons for this popularity reside in the fact that
water exchange is found to be slowest in Eu°+ complexes in comparison to other lanthanide :
complexes [6]. A second factor is that the weak electron donating properties of tetraamide oxygen =
donor atoms compared with DOTA itself results in a three- to fourfold decrease in the rate of water =
exchange between an inner-sphere Eu°+-bound water molecule and bulk solvent, a condition : a
highly favourable for CEST [7]. Furthermore, alteration of the DOTA-tetraamide structure has :
provided a way to design a variety of paraCEST agents responsive to physiological indicators 78
such as pH [8,9], temperature [10,11], other metal ions [12-14], lactate [15,16] and enzyme activity : w
[17,18]. Hence, the ability of these agents to provide functional information of this sort highlights :
their potential use as molecular imaging probes. The rate of proton exchange (kex) is one of the 7S
most important factors that determine CEST efficiency in these complexes [19], so most attempts [SB
to improve CEST sensitivity have been focused on designing paraCEST agents that exhibit .
slow proton exchange kinetics. The major factors influencing kex in Eu*+-based agents are the
