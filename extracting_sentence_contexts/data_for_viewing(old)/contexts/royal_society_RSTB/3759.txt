two sets of experiments :—

The fact that stimulus itself may enhance conductivity in a sub-tonic tissue may
be seen in a striking manner in specimens of Mimosa which are in sluggish

condition. It will there be found that the application of stimulus on the petiole will
at first fail to be conducted. If, however, we apply the same stimulus again after
the usual interval of, say 15 min., the excitation, which failed in the previous case to
be conducted, will now reach the pulvinus and induce the responsive fall. Stimulus
had thus imparted conductivity to the tissue.

I find again that when the plant is brought to an optimum condition, then the
