The integrations required in an energy treatment (§§40—45) are replaced, corre-
spondingly, by summations in accordance with approximate formulas. It was remarked
in Part VIIC (§9) that ‘Simpson’s rule’ will often give results as good, or better, than
those deduced by more elaborate treatment: here we observe that when the integrand
has both zero value and zero gradient at either end of its range, still better results may
come from simple summation.

48. Let 0, 1, 2, ...,2N—1, 2N be points of subdivision in the range AB, figure 14,
and suppose the integrand y, of which both the value and the slope is zero at A and B, to be
extrapolated ‘by reflexion’ to fictitious points C and D, just outside the range. Then
by hypothesis

Ys =Ye=9; Yo=M> Yo = Yon-1» (i)

where 2NA = total range AB.
