'=particles. See Plate XI. figs. 12 and 14.

S The part first formed is the hook : this has at first its internal cavity rather larger
-Sthan that in the older ones, and there is an irregularity of its outline, indicating a want
of complete union of its component particles. 'The handle is formed next : this is more
Zremarkable for its want of symmetry than the curyed part, ome pieces of it appearing to
:2be merely applied to each other. See Plate XI. figs. 10 and 14. Lastly, the tubercles are
Sadded. Neither the whole nor the parts of a hooklet undergo any increase in size after
being once formed, but, on the contrary, rather suffer a slight diminution. The hooklets
Sof the old Cysticercus are frequently smaller than those of the young ones. But these
Sorgans yary a little in different animalcules, being rather smaller in some than in others,
"=but those belonging to the same individual are remarkably regular in this respect.
2 From the facts that have just been mentioned, the hooklets of the animalcule in ques-
Jtion do not appear to be formed by cell-development. For by the most careful examina-
S tion of these organs, both recent, and after the application of acids, I have not been able
Sto distinguish anything which can be looked upon as a cell or cell-nucleus, calculated to
Agive the idea of their being developed from previously existing cells, or in dependence of
cells; but, on the contrary, all the various forms and characters which they present during
the process of their formation simply indicate the coalescence of very minute spherules
of an homogeneous material, exceeding the number of a complete set of hooklets, into
8mall globular masses, and these again into larger pieces, and 80 on successively, until
recognizable portions of hooklets come into view, which, coalescing, build up, as it were,
an entire organ.

It is worthy of remark, that if these structures had been produced directly from the
