clearly associated with a renewal of reproductive activity, demonstrated by the
sudden increase of the birth-rate in November—December.

Thus there is substantial reason for the view that marked stimulation of the
reproductive system of individuals as a whole in Cuba is closely associated with
climatic changes year by year, and there can, I think, be no doubt that climate has
a pronounced effect on reproductive activity ; but such effect is not due to the results
brought about either by a fall or by a rise of temperature only, it is essentially
governed by the resultant of the various forces which are induced by a marked change
of climate within certain limits.

Climate, however, is not the only factor which influences the breeding seasons,
that there must be other causes is clear from the fact that there are no special
climatic conditions which would appear to be sufficient to account for the unusually
vigorous spring breeding season in 1905 (vide birth-rate for November—December,
1905).
