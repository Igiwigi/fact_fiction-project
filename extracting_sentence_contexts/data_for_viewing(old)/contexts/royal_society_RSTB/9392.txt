It will be interesting to record from neurons during stimu-
lation with these tools and to compare the evoked activity
patterns with those generated by physiologically relevant
stimuli. It is conceivable that some neurons are constrained
to adopt one of a few possible firing states, regardless of
the activity that is injected with the optogenetic or

thermogenetic actuators. Another potential issue of artifi-
cially induced firing is the observation that excessive firing
can put neurons into a refractory depolarization block
period where they do not fire at all [126]. In such a case,
investigators might be misled to think an observed pheno-
type results from excitation when in fact the neurons have
been inhibited.

5. Recording circuit physiology

Stimulation and inhibition techniques allow one to assemble
a low-resolution idea of how certain neural circuits are
ordered and operate to direct behaviour. These models can
be challenged and extended by using the same cell-specific
expression control to produce a number of genetically encoded
reporters of neural activity and cell-signalling processes
(figures 3 and 4).
