new phenotype is exceedingly improbable. To establish the
plausibility of a scenario for a trait shared by all humans, we
thus have to show that each new variant conveys a fitness
advantage both when it is rare in a population and when it
has already become quite common. Moreover, we must show
that this advantage applies to the individual that carries it,
rather than to the group as a whole (simply assuming selection
for the benefit of the group is widely considered a fallacy).
Traits that benefit the group rather than the individual can
only evolve under quite specific circumstances described by
kin selection and social evolution theory sensu Frank [102].

A third point is that we need to be aware of the fact that
the fitness advantage of a trait might not, or not only, come
from its contribution to increased success in reproduction
through increased survival (natural selection in the narrow
sense, though including benefits associated with individuals’
ability to establish effective social alliances), but may also
come from the trait’s effects on increased success in reproduc-
tion via attractiveness to potential partners (Darwinian sexual
selection [103]). This could be particularly relevant for the
evolution of music, as sexual selection is invariably invoked
in understanding the evolution of elaborate animal aesthetic
displays (where the connection between display and fitness
can be very indirect). Music is nothing if not an aesthetic dis-
