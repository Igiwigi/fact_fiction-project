E and H however give an are line at 4811°81, which gives a separation of 3815°57
with K.R.’s line at 4065°22. This has the appearance of a D set, D,, being at
4792°79 with a satellite separation of 82°47. But if so it is quite out of step with
the progression of the D,, lines for Cu and Ag, viz., 5220(Cu), 5471(Ag). But
5837'64 gives with the above 479279 a separation 3733°43 the same as that between
4792 and 4065, and they are in step with Cu and Ag as D,,(2) and D., (2), the
fainter satellite D,, being unobserved. This would seem the more probable allocation.
In any case, the curious doubling of a D type would have to be explained. There is,
however, here not sufficient data to determine the limits, or the other formule
constants or the value of A. But it is possible to arrive at a probable estimate by
the following considerations. The limit D (©) will probably be in step with those of
Cu and Ag, viz., 31515, 30644, z.e., will be in the neighbourhood of 30000. Now A
. must give y = 3815°54 and must itself’ be a multiple of the oun, in fact if it is similar
to Cu and Ag of 3,. Now W =197°20 with an uncertainty of a few units in the
second decimal place. The ratio g = 861°80*+y, where y is probably not greater
than 1 in the first decimal place and it will be regarded as a correction on the ‘8.
From this it follows that 3 = 1406°930+'097+4°38y. The uncertainty ‘097 due to
the uncertainty in W produces so small an effect that it may be neglected here.
Now A must be a multiple of 3 and must give with the proper value of D(),
vy = 8815°54+4°30s, ‘30 being the maximum error of » and therefore s between +1.
This condition gives the following sets of possible limits in the neighbourhood of

D() = 80,000 :— 30819'15+1'57s—6y with A = 763
about 30542 778
