4. Neural networks and proteins

Multi-valley landscapes are not always a nuisance—in fact, they can be very
valuable. A good example is found in Hopfield’s (1982) simple model for biological
neural networks where the valleys provide storage for memories and where
dynamics within the valleys represents memory retrieval. In this model, one
imagines the ‘brain’ as made up of a very large number of neurons, firing to
different degrees, connected by a large number of ‘synapses’, both excitatory
and inhibitory, the former such that a firing efferent neuron tends to make the
afferent neuron fire, and the latter such that a firing efferent neuron tends to
reduce the firing of the afferent neuron.
