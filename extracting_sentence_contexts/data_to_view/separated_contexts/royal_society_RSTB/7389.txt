3 REMARKS ON THE NAMES FOR TOBACCO IN NEw GUINEA
3 Almost everywhere, especially in the mountainous interior, there are unrelated
2 terms for native-grown tobacco, some of which seem to have a very limited range. This
B fact probably may be explained by the nature of the country which consists for the most
= part of high mountains, the numerous valleys of which have steep sides. These geo-
g graphical features conduce to isolation, which is further increased by the almost
a universal hostility between neighbouring groups of peoples. But such hostility, though
12 chronic, is not continuous, as there is always a need for the exchange of commodities,
Ss such for example as a trade in stone implements, and the strong desire of inland peoples
Z for marine shells or objects made from them; for these, feathers or other local products
‘al may be exchanged, but perhaps the most important article of barter is tobacco.
