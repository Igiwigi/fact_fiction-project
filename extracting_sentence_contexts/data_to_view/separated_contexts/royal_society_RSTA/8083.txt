Price.® The distinction between the cases of periodic
and aperiodic fields is somewhat analogous to that between (a) the forced vibrations of
an elastic dissipative system, due to external forces of assigned period, and ()) the
motion of the system from rest, due to external aperiodic forces ; in the latter case,
the modes of free vibration have to be found. and their amplitude determined to
satisfy the initial conditions.

1.10. Seismological evidence! indicates a fairly sharp change in the constitution of
the earth at a depth of about 15 km., but there is no independent indication of a change
of properties near the level, 250 km. deep, where the conducting core begins (according
to CHAPMAN’s estimate based on the daily magnetic variations). There may, in fact,
be no sudden inerease of « at this level, but only a gradual increase, and this inerease
may continue to much higher values of « than 3-6.107%. ‘To throw light on this
point we here examine the actual distribution of the induced currents in the core (on

the supposition that it is uniformly conducting and that « = 3-65.10), both for
the daily variations and for magnetic storms. It is found that the currents penetrate
further in the latter case, but that below about 2000 km. they are small and have
only a slight influence on the surface magnetic field. Thus the region about which
these magnetic variations can afford information is unlikely to extend below this depth,
and may fall far short of it if the conductivity increases downwards.
