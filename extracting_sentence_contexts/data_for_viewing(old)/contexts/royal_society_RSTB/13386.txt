updates The loss of recombination between sex chromosomes has occurred repeatedly

Cite this article: Jeffries DL, Gerchen JF, throughout nature, with important implications for their subsequent
evolution. Explanations for this remarkable convergence have generally
invoked only adaptive processes (e.g. sexually antagonistic selection); how-
ever, there is still little evidence for these hypotheses. Here we propose a
model in which recombination on sex chromosomes is lost due to the neutral

that sequence divergence, in any form, reduces the probability of recombina-
tion between any two sequences. Using simulations, we show that, under
certain conditions, a region of suppressed recombination arises and expands
outwards from the sex-determining locus, under purely neutral processes.
