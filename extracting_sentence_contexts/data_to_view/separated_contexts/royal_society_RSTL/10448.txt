H. TOMLINSON ON THE INFLUENCE OF STRESS AND

must within these limits completely compensate one another. In fact, however, there
resnlts a diminution of the amplitude of oscillation ; hence the loss of energy
therein can only correspond to the work which is expended in the alteration of the
positions of equilibrium, or the rotation of the molecules from +B8 to —B which
determine it, The diminution of amplitude may therefore be taken as a meagure of -
this work. Since the shifting of the permanent torsion-position is, within certain
narrow limits, proportional to the temporary torsion, and therefore the rotation of the
molecules therewith is likewise approximately 80, the amplitudes must, within those
limits, diminish according to the law of a geometrical series,”

Again, Professor WIEDEMANN agrees with Sir W. THomsoN that, whilst an increase of
load at first increases the 1oss of energy, this loss, under repeated oscillations, becomes
less and less, and finally approaches in magnitude that obtained with the lighter load,
W1gDEMANN's explanation of the matter is that, jusb as in his own statical experi-
ments the torsional displacements were found to be initially greater with a heavier
load than with a lighter one, 80 also must the decrements attendant upon oscillations
be greater in the former case, but, like those, gradually approach the magnitude which
is obseryed with the lighter loading.
