Appendix A. Conditional hyperbolic method of moments inversion algorithm 8
8
This is the inversion algorithm for the 4-node CHyQMOM scheme. Given the first- and second- ‘Ss

order moments {/1,9, 0,1, 2,0, 41,1, Ho,2} it computes the nodes (&;, é;) and corresponding weights
w; for i=1,2,3,4, in phase-space. In this work, we assume j19,9 = 1. To tail the algorithm to our
hybrid scheme of arbitrary number of quadrature nodes, the algorithm adds some fictitious extra
nodes to the scheme with zero-valued weights to match the desired number of nodes of the hybrid
scheme.
