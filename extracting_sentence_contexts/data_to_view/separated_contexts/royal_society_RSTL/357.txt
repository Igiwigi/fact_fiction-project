PB =y =yLw and AC=PB = vn,
and QC= LL xv=4v'w, and generally the 2 ordinate TF is
equal to 4 x, hence
Vx =0
which is the equation whose solution has been just found. PRoBLEM XII. Given the equation

i =22
required the form of v.
Assume va=e fox
then Va=ze few
and o PP oxr=2u
take the function © on both sides, then this becomes
FP oOx=043,

This is a functional equation of the first order relative to 6,
and may be solved either by the methods exhibited in the first
part of this paper, or by the very elegant one of LaeLace,
fis a perfectly arbitrary function, except that neither fx nor
f* @ must be equal to x: from not attending to this circum-
stance, I was at first led into several errors ; the reason of these
two restrictions is, that in the first case we at once determine
vw to be equal to, and in the second, we in fact make
ax = w, neither of which are necessarily true. ProBLEM XU. Given the equation.
YAZz=xr

This admits of a solution similar to the last, by assuming vx
