the bow and stern then rises about 11 feet above that in still water; and supposing this
level to be uniform throughout the length, the pressure on the midship section would
be about 770 tons, producing a bending-moment of about, 3450 foot-tons—that is to 8Ay,
about one fourteenth of the bending-moment due to vertical forces in the wave-hollow.
The true bending-moment of the pressure would be less than this, and might conse-
quently be neglected. - Hence we are confirmed in the opinion that for ships at sea it is
only necessary to consider vertical forces.

I must now pass on to notice briefly the longitudinal strains of ships in exceptional
positions—such as those produced by launching, grounding, and other causes. Although
exceptional, these strains undoubtedly occur; and their effect may be, as I shall show,
more severe than that of any of the statical strains to which approximations have been
made. Preceding writers have recognized this fact to some extent, but no author has
done 80 much as Mr. FairBairyN towards giving quantitative expressions to these excep-
tional strains.

BouGvER, RoMME, and other early writers had a very clear conception of the principal
causes of launching-strains. They call attention to the fact that in all, or nearly all,
launches the ship's bow or stern is water-borne before the other end has left the launch-
ing-ways, and that this cannot be prevented altogether even when the ways are extended
further out into the water than is customary. Some of them go s0 far as to urge the
policy of building ships in dock in order to avoid these strains, and support their opinion
by statements of the large amount of © breakage ” that takes place when a ship is set
afloat for the first time from a slip-way. Others combat this opinion, and show by actual
examples that ships built in dock also break when they are floated, although the breakage
