45. Take (x=0, y=0) for the equations of the directrix line, z=0 for the equation of
the plane of the simple conic, w=0 for that of the plane of the nodal conic; since the
conics intersect in two points, they lie on a quadric surface, say the surface U=0; the
equations of the simple conic thus are z=0, U=0; those of the nodal conic are w=0,
U=0. The directrix line &=0, y=0 meets the nodal conic; that is, U must vanish iden-
tically for &=0, y=0, w=0; and this will be the case if only the term in 2* is wanting;
