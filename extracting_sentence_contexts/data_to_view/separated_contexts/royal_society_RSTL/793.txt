These facts which Mr. Bautr has enabled me to bring
forward, appear to point out an important change the blood
undergoes, after it is extravasated,. When this happens in
living animal bodies, from whatever cause, and in whatever
circumstances it takes place, no difficulty remains in account-
ing for its afterwards becoming vascular, since all that is
necessary for that purpose is the red blood being received
into the channels of which this net-work is formed. I shall not detain the Society with any farther observations
in support of what I have advanced, satisfied that if the facts
do not bear themselves out, it will be superfluous to load them
with theoretical opinions. I cannot conclude this Lecture, without paying a tribute to
the President of the Society ; not a tribute of praise, but a tri-
bute of justice; for whenever general science, or any of its
branches, are brought under his consideration, the zeal and
exertion, which he shows upon all occasions, to promote the
pursuits of individuals, exceeds whatever has been done by
others, in this or any other country, and is above all praise. Whatever Mr. Bavxr has already done, and whatever he
may hereafter bring to light, respecting the more minute
parts of animal bodies, is entirely to be attributed to the Pre-
sident; for it is at his particular request, under his encou-
ragement, and in compliance with his wishes, that Mr.

Bavrs has put a restraint upon himself, and for a time laid
aside the prosecution of the Anatomy of Vegetables, which
from his early youth has been his fayourite occupation, to
assist in bringing to light appearances in the anatomy of
animals, which, without his aid, must still have remained in
obscurity.
