portional to c 8in (þ,—0)=ec sin (90*—POH), because this represents the approach of
the brass to the journal within the mean distance a, for all points, except those at
which it is negative ; at these there would be no wear. So long then as the journal
ran in one direction only, the wear would tend to preserve the radius and true circular
form of that portion of the arc from C to F (fig. 17, p. 193), altering the radius at F,
and enlarging it from F to D. On reversal, however, C and F change sides, and hence
alternate motion in both directions would preserve the radius constant all over the
brass. The experience emphasized by Mr. Tower that the journal after running for
some time in one direction would not run at first in the other, strongly bears out this
conelusion. Hence it follows that had the journal been continuously run in one
direction the condition of lubrication, as shown by the distribution of oil pressur6
round the journal, would have been modified, the pressure falling between O and B
on the or. side of the journal, a conclusion which is borne out by the fact that in the
experiments with brass No. 2, which was run for some time continuously in one
direction, the pressure measured on the on side is 80mewhat below that calculated on
the agsumption of circular form, although the agreement is close for the other four
Points (see fig. 2, Plate 8),

When the surfaces are completely separated by oil it is difficult to see what can
cause wear, But there is generally metallic contact at starting, and hence abrasion,
which will introduce metallic particles into the oil (blacken it) ; these particles will be
more or less carried round and round, causing wear and increasing the number of
particles and the viscosity of the oil. Thus the rate of wear would depend on the

impurities in the oil, the values of ec, L and the velocity of the journal, and hence
