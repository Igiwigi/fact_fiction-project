Being separated after a-few minutes, and made to act alone,
they exhibited powers which - appeared three or four times
greater than if. they had never been in connexion ; the zinc
resumed a much higher positive, and the copper a higher
negative tate, than if they had not before been in the anta-
gonist-or-unconformable conditions. All these facts bear upon- the same point, and confirm the
view which 1.tookof the nature of Voltaic combinations in
the Bakerian Lecture for 1806 ; in all of which, whether
the destruction of the electrical equilibrium” is/ produced by
the contact of metals or fluids, it is always: restored by che-
mical, changes, and in which the circulation, if it may be 80
called, depends upon a-union of these causes, the direction of
the currents/ being always opposite in the metallic-and Fluid
parts of the combination, s0 as to produce what may' be re-
garded as an electrical circle.
