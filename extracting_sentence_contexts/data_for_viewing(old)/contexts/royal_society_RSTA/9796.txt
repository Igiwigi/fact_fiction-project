'= 2nd group of elements, whilst a similar rule of a positive value of @ recurs in the
€ 3rd group. This suggests that the series giving doublets have « positive and triplets
4 «@ negative, but this is contradicted by the triplet series of O, S and Se, which behave
& in the same way as the doublets of Groups 1 and 3. The question naturally arises,
° is there a typical D-sequence with « positive, and the diffuse series inthe 2nd group
E do not really belong to this type, or is there no actual D-sequence, #.c., no regular
© type of formula to which the D-series conform. The difficulty of finding formule to
accurately represent any particular D-series would point to the latter supposition,
a supposition also which is strengthened when we study comparatively the series of
numerical values of the denominators found directly from observations as is done
below. In the case of the alkalies the formulz given in [I.] (as well as those in 1/m*)
do not reproduce well the high orders and are probably only within the limits of error
because the lines are so diffuse that the observation errors are very large. In fact
one of the few excessive deviations found in [I.] was that of NaD (6), in which it is

not probable that the error is one of observation. In Group 2 the Zn sub-group can
be reproduced fairly well with a formula in #/(2m—1) in which « is negative. Mg
can also be reproduced within error limits by a formula of the same kind, but it is
impossible to do so for Ca, and Sr and Ba require additional terms in 1/m*. Tn
