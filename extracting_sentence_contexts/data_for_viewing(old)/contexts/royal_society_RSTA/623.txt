TMEN and the influence of the superconducting shielding do not significantly contribute to


the combined standard uncertainty. Furthermore, the variance of the CPSD, which is increased | |
by non-thermal noise and depends on the number of frequency bins used and the number

of averages in the periodogram, can also be kept on a negligible level. Finally, the relative “3
combined standard uncertainty for the noise temperatures is 0.59%. According to the linear 8

characteristic of the pMFFT owing to the Nyquist relation and the practically temperature-
independent uncertainty contributions, this relative uncertainty holds for the whole intended
operation range from about 5 K down to 1mK. This expectation is experimentally supported by
the fact that measurements using a commercial MFFT (Magnicon GmbH, Hamburg, Germany; see
http://www.magnicon.com) in relative primary mode showed agreement with the PLTS-2000
on a 1% level down to 1mK [22] even though the non-thermal noise level, which increases the

uncertainty contribution from the signal-to-noise ratio especially at the lowest temperatures, is in : &
the commercial MFFT more than an order of magnitude higher than that of the pMFFT described Dos
here (§4e). At temperatures between 1K and 5K, the change of the superconducting properties : =

6. Conclusion 18
We have presented a complete description of the pMFFT, a new primary thermometer, which : g
will enable measurements of thermodynamic temperature in the temperature region from DN
5K down to 1mK. The pMFFT is a calculable DC SQUID-based noise thermometer using a : g
cross-correlation set-up. It combines a construction allowing the precise determination of the [&
