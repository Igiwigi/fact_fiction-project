236 B. R. SETH ON FINITE STRAIN

To decide the sign we observe that for a simple tension z is always positive or
negative according as z’, the co-ordinate before strain is positive or negative. Since
z’ = rz, we must take the positive sign with the square root in (6). This is also
confirmed by the fact that if we neglect powers of T/E higher than the first we get
w = TZ/E, a result true for small strains.
From (5.2) we have :
p= 4 (14+),
aE E!

and neglecting the negative sign as before, we get

2nT

p=q=(1+ ny

Thus the only physically possible solution is given by
