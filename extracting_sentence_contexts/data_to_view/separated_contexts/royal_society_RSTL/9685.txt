& *It is not possible to make an adequate consideration of the suhject of this section
without a treatment of the theory of the tidal friction of a planet attended by a pair
of &atellites. It was shown above that if the moon were to move orbitally nearly as fast as the
earth rotates, the solar tidal friction would be more important than the lunar, however
near the moon might be to the earth.
