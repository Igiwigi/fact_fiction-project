3dly. It was proved, that the crust which covers certain
marine animals, such as crabs, lobsters, crayfish, and prawns,
consists of a strong cartilage, hardened by a mixture of carbo-
nate and phosphate of lime; and that thus these crustaceous
bodies occupy a middle place between shell and bone, although
they incline principally to the nature of shell. And,

4thly. It was proved, that a certain portion of carbonate of
lime enters the composition of bones in general ; the proportion
of it however being, to the phosphate of lime, vice versd to that
observed in the crustaceous marine substances.

Upon the view, therefore, of these facts, it is evident, that
there is a great similarity in the construction of shell and bone;
and that there is even an approximation in the nature of their
composition, by the intermediate crustaceous substances.

These remarks, with the experiments by which they are
supported, form the principal features of that paper, which the
Royal Society honoured with a place in the last volume of
the Philosophical Transactions, At that time, it was not my
