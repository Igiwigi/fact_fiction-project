Our aim here is not to provide a complete description of the theory of complex dimensions
[5-7] (and especially [7]). Instead, we just provide a few examples and results. In the present
exposition, we reverse the chronological order as the results from [1-4] (§3) were obtained before
the rigorous theory of complex dimensions [5-7], and in fact (along with the work in [13-15,31],
in particular) provide a natural heuristic and mathematical motivation for it. Let £=CS be the Cantor string; it is associated with the bounded open set 2 C R defined as
the complement in [0,1] of the classic (ternary) Cantor set C. Note that 2 is merely the union
of the sequence of disjoint open intervals (the ‘middle thirds’) which are deleted in the standard
construction of C.
