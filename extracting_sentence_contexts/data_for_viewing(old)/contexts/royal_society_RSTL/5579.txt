direction, being either null, or now in the direction of one of the thighs, now in that of
the other. In all cases during contraction of the thigh provided with its nerve, the
usual deflection occurs, that is owing to the current circulating in the external are of the
muscle from the inferior towards the superior extremity of that muscle.

T shall now add a few brief observations, which may throw further light on the inter-
pretation of these experiments. TI need not stay to prove that the effects observed by
means of the galvanometer, produced by a muscle in contraction, cannot depend either
on a portion of the current employed to irritate the nerve, or on changes of contact
between the muscle and the extremities of the galvanometer, or finally, on the variable
resistance of a muscle in contraction ; these doubts have already been completely removed
by the experiments of M. Du Bois REyMoxnD. In endeavouring to understand the nature
of the electrical phenomena which occur in a muscle during contraction, the fact which
merits our chief attention is, that the needle of the galvanometer, which deflects at first
in the direction of the muscular current of the gastrocnemius, or of the entire thigh,
descends rapidly to zero at the moment of contraction and remains deflected in an oppo-
site direction to that of the muscular current, during the whole time that the contrac-

tions are frequent and powerful. M. PoviLLer, in his remarkable report *, gives a lucid
re8ume of the conclusions at which M. Du Bois ReyMoxD arrived, in the following terms :
—* D'apres les principes de M. Du Bots ReyMoxD Teffet d'une contraction soutenue n'est
pas de faire naitre un courant, mais MUaffaiblir et de suspendre par intermittance un cou-
rant qui pr6-existait ; il faut done un courant pre-existant, ou il en faut deux qui soient
6gaux et oppos6s et qui se neutralisent,” &c. &c. The slightest reflection on the three
