soaked in a saturated solution of potassium dichromate and exposed to sunlight for
half an hour. By analogy with the well-known action of light and potassium dichromate
on gelatine it was considered possible that there might be some action on keratin also.
The effect observed, on subsequently stretching the fibres to 50% in water, steaming
for various times at this extension, and resteaming without restraint till no more con-
traction took place, was a delay in the setting action of steam—just the opposite to
what was observed with ultra-violet light. Without further tests it is not yet clear
whether light is essential in this experiment ; at the moment, the results would appear
to be analogous to those obtained by SpeaKman (loc. cit., p. 382) with de-aminated hair.

The acidic dichromate apparently reacts with the amino-groups so as to prevent their
participation in the process of permanent set. Support is given to this explanation by
the fact that wool dyed with eosin also showed a similar behaviour.*
Variations along the Fibre Length.—In a series of super-contraction tests of the roots,
middles, and tips of Cotswold wool fibres marked variations were found in proceeding
from one end to the other. The super-contraction curve for normal roots is shown in

* [Note added in proof, October 10th, 1933.—Further work (Woops, ‘Nature,’ vol. 132, p. 709, 1933),
has now shown that Cotswold wool fibres, after immersion for only ten minutes in a saturated solution
of potassium dichromate, give rise to a well-defined curve of super-contraction, but have lost almost
entirely the property of being set by steam in the elongated form.]
