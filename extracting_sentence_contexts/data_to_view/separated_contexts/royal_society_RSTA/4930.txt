Indeed, Joule was never able to command respect by the force of a strong personality
and this may well account for his comparative obscurity outside the scientific community. He
needed the support of someone who possessed the gifts he lacked, but it was not until 1847 that he
found that person in the shape of William Thomson, later Lord Kelvin (1824-1907), who, although
6 years younger, had no trouble with self-publicity. Until then Joule struggled, publishing papers
of major scientific importance but making almost no impact whatsoever.
