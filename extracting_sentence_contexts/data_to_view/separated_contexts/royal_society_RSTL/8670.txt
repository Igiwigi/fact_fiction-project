Unfortunately in this case his conclusions were accepted without
examination by distinguished writers in two popular works on Physical Geography, and
obtained a currency for which it is difficult to acconnth. Although Sir Jaxts Ross's
experiments were in themselves valuable, they required both detail and corroboration,
and his conclusions were evidently based on an as8umption for which there was no
warrant. And yet, while his important and positive facts as to the persistence of life to
great depths failed to receive the attention they deserved, his physical fallacies were
received almost without a question. As with his predecessor, D'URviLLe, Sir Jags
found in his more numerous and deeper observations that the unprotected thermometer
commonly marked a temperature of and about 39* to 40*; and taking the maximum
density of fresh water to be 39*:5, he applied the same reasoning to the open seas as had
already been applied to freshwater lakes, and assumed, exactly as D'URyILLE had done,
that a uniform temperature of about 39*5 prevailed at depths varying with the latitude,
and that a belt of water of that temperature, extending from the surface downwards,
encircles the globe between the 50th and 60th degrees of south latitude, or, as he more
definitely fixes it, in a mean latitude of about 56* 26' S. ||
