primitive regularity is more nearly maintained in the smaller-leaved Pteridophyta,
and probably with the greatest fidelity in the Lyeopods.

Errect oF THESE Resuurs ON SystEMATIC GROUPING OF THE PrERIDOPHYTA.

The results from the study of the spore-producing members thus summarised on
the systematic grouping of the Pteridophyta do not introduce any great change from
the grouping at present current. But any arrangement based on comparative study
of the spore-producing members must be checked by consideration of other characters,
anatomical and embryogical, as well as those of the gametophyte and sexual organs,
though, as explained elsewhere,* the spore-producing members are to be accorded prior
importance over the vegetative organs in sporophyte, on the ground of evolutionary
history. This method has, in fact, been the practice in classification by systematists
at large.

The general comparison points to a radial strobiloid type underlying the construction
of the neutral generation in all the Pteridophytes; but this type has been subject to
modification by megaphyllous, and by dorsiventral development. The latter is
characteristic throughout of no great group, but appears to have originated
sporadically, it is therefore of only small account for systematic purposes. But the
enlargement of the leaf appears general in some groups, such as the Ferns and
Ophioglossacez, and, in a less degree, in the Sphenophylleee and Psilotaceze. The
comparisons given above show, moreover, that the complexity of the spore-producing
members in the homosporous Pteridophytes goes hand in hand with the complexity
of the leaves, a fact which readily finds its explanation on a basis of nutrition.
