FURNACE REACTIONS UNDER HIGH GASEOUS PRESSURES. 449

By referring again to Table VIIL. it will be found that this view is substantiated
by a comparison between the are and resistance experiments.

In the latter the yield is always extremely low. This may be explained by the
fact that as the inner layer of mixture approaches its fusing point it flows away by
gravity, and, ceasing to transmit the current, is not maintained at the requisite
temperature for marked reduction to occur.

We come now to that curious apparent contradiction of facts which has for so long
puzzled investigators in this field; namely, that though aluminium bronze and ferro-
aluminium can be so readily produced, no process exists by which the metal itself can
be obtained from the oxide, except by indirect means. What is, then, the function of
the auxiliary metal? It has been suggested that a marked chemical affinity exists
between the aluminium and the metal with which it alloys, the evidence in support
of this being the high heat evolution which is noticeable when aluminium is added to
the metals in a molten state.

It must, however, be remembered that under ordinary conditions the fused metals
contain dissolved oxide, and it therefore seemed worth while to carry out a preliminary
investigation of this question.
