and X-ray photographs showing a large number of diffraction spectra have been obtained
(Meyer & Pankow 1935). On the basis of these it has been possible, not merely to calculate

many periodicities, but to suggest molecular configurations which would account for the

spectra which appear and for their relative intensities. Although it would be impossible to
extract very much information about the structure of the molecules of the oriented com-
ponent present in the scales from the X-ray photographs reproduced in figures 52 to 56,
plate 3, the fact that the few spectra visible are the most conspicuous spectra in photo-
graphs of well-oriented preparations of polyacetylglucosamine is strong evidence that it is
chain molecules of chitin which are oriented parallel to the long axis of the scales, since this
axis is parallel to the meridian of the photographs.

The diagram obtained was a fibre-diagram with the fibre-axis parallel to the long axis of
the scales (the X axis) in the marginal fringe (figure 53). The scales are arranged on the
wings with astonishing regularity and, on the whole, microscopically accurate parallelism.
It is probable that imperfect parallelism in the mass of scales is due more to inaccuracy in
mounting successive wings than to imperfect alinement in single wings. The meridional
dispersion in individual scales may well be less than that shown in the photographs.

It will be recalled that the lateral marginal scales have flattened distal blades (figures 10,
