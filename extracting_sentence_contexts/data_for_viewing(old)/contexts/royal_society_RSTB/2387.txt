(compare phot. 12, from Wixp’s cone, with fig. 14, from a detached specimen), while
horizontal sections can also be recognised by comparison with the transverse section of
the cone (phot. 11, s*).* With a little consideration the various oblique sections so
commonly met with can also, in most cases, be referred to their approximate planes,
with reference to the parent strobilus. After these preliminary considerations we
will go on to consider the structure of the Lepidocarpon “ seed ” in detail, as shown in
the detached specimens, which are very numerous, and often beautifully preserved,
and which, in the light of Wixp's specimen of the strobilus, can now be correctly
interpreted.

The sections figured by WiLLiAMson of the seed which he named Cardiocarpon
anomalum (Lepidocarpon Lomasi of the present paper) were all cut approximately
in the tangential plane (with reference to the parent cone), as shown by the fact that
the micropyle appears at the apex as a narrow passage, as well as by the general form
of the organ, and by the vascular bundle appearing in transverse section, +

* Where the micropyle appears in an approximately transverse section of the cone, as in the “seed”
shown enlarged in Plate 43, fig. 27, this is because the plane of section is really oblique, forming an angle
with the transverse and tangential planes.

+ WILLIAMSON, it is true, was under the impression that fig. 64 in his Part X. represented a section in
a plane vertical to that of his fig. 119 in Part VIII. from another specimen (see Part X., p. 518). An
examination of the sections shows, however, that this is not the case. Both sections alike show all the
features characteristic of the tangential aspect. The difference in form no doubt depends chiefly ov the
distance of the plane of section from the axis of the parent cone. The narrow section shown in fig. 64,
