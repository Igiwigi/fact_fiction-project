. That the series of obseryations should be s0 arranged, that, at every
station, one complete tide (from high water to high water, or from low water to low
water) should be completely observed on every day, its observations being made at
small equidistant intervals. That snpplementary observations, applying only to the
neighbourhood of the low water or high water omitted in the obseryations of the
complete tide, should also be made, for the development of the principal facts of
diurnal tide. Finally, that the zeros of the tide-gauges should be connected with the
principal lines of level, s0 that every observation $should be referred to the same
hydrostatic level. These- suggestions were adopted in their utmost extent by Colonel Cousy.
