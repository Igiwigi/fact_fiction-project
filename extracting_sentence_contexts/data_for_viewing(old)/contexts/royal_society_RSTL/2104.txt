such suppositions as, © that all attractions, chemical,*- elec-
trical, magnetic, and gravitative, may depend upon'the same
cause ;** or to still looser expressions, in which different
words are used and applied to the same ideas, and in which
all the phenomena of nature are supposed to depend on the
Dynamic system, or the equilibetuns and opposition of anta-
gonist powers.

The true origin of all that has been done in cries
mical science was the accidental discovery of MM. N1cnorsoN
and CARLISLE, of the decomposition of water by the- pile of
Vorrta, April go, 1800.  These Gentlemen immediately
added to this capital fact, the knowledge of the decomposition
of certain metallic solutions, and the circumstance of the
separation of alkali on the negative plates of the apparatus.
Mr. CRu1oKSHANK, in pursuing their experiments, added to
them many important new results, such as the decomposi-
tions of muriates of magnesia, soda and ammonia, by the

® In the Systeme Universelle of M. Azars, not only are all the phenomena of
nature referred to the same cause, but specific reasonings upon the "mode of its
operation given. - In this work, published in 1810, not only is the identity of Mag-
netism and Electricity insisted on, but an attempt is made to explain the manner
in which the two electrical fluids produce the magnetic phenomena, pag. 239 Vol. I,
