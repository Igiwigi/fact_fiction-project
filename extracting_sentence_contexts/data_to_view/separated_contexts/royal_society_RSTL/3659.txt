IN PASSING THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE. 257

stations. Not only did the continuity of the law which both series followed prove the
exactness of the reduction of intensities obtained with one instrument into degrees of
the other, but what I have called unexpected, was the fact that an equal ordinate or
intensity should be indicated for a passage through an equal mass of air at both
Stations. For that mass of air, it is to be observed, was very differently composed in
the two cases. On the Faulhorn, a very oblique transit through the rare air, superior
to 8400 feet, was requisite to give the same mass as a less oblique transit through the
whole atmosphere, in order to arrive at the lower station.
