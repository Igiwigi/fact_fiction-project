This time is ſhewn by
a clock regulated to agree with the tranſit of the ſtars
acroſs the meridian. The interval between the
tranſit of the ſun acroſs the meridian one day, and
his tranſit the next day, is called an apparent folar
day, which is divided into hours, minutes, Cc. of
apparent time. 'The ſolar day, it is manifeſt, and
its hours, minutes, &c. are of different lengths, at |
different times of the year: on account of which |
inequality, a good clock, which keeps equal time,
cannot long agree with the ſun's motion, which is
unequal. Therefore, aſtronomers have deviſed an
imaginary time, called mean ſolar time; which is
what would be pointed out by the ſun, if his motion
"in right aſcenſion from day to day was uniform, or, |
in other words, it is what would be pointed out by a ,
fictitious ſun or planet ſuppoſed to move uniformly
in the equator, with a motion equal to the mean

motion of the ſun in longitude, its diſtance from the
firſt point of Aries (meaning hereby the mean equi-
nox) being always equal to the mean longitude of
the ſun: and as apparent noon is the inſtant of the
true ſun's coming to the meridian, ſo mean noon is
the inſtant at which this fictitious planet would come
to the meridian. The interval between its coming to
the meridian on any two ſucceflive days is a mean
ſolar day, which is divided into hours, minutes, &c.
of mean ſolar time; all which it is manifeſt will pre-
ſerve the ſame length at all times of the year,
The equation of time, at the inſtant of apparent
noon, or of the ſun's paſſing the meridian, being
equal to the difference between mean time and -12
hours, is alſo equal to the interval between the mean
and true ſun's paſſing the meridian expreſſed in mean
ſolar time: to find which, we have the diſtance of
the mean ſun from the meridian, at the inſtant of
apparent noon, equal to the difference between the
ſun's apparentand mean right aſcenſion (both reckoned
either from the mean or apparent equinox) which
may be called the equation of right aſcenſion. The
queſtion, therefore, comes to this, How many mi-
nutes and ſeconds of mean ſolar time doth the mean
ſun take to move this diſtance up to or from the
meridian ?
