But the necessity for a supplementary (“ forced ”) solution remains, because it is not
possible to derive from (22) an expression for 4 which continues to satisfy both boundary
conditions when ¢ becomes finite. Hence, if one or more of the free disturbances
(satisfying both boundary conditions) should be characterised by an exponentially
increasing time factor,—and this is the question at issue,—it appears that the forced
disturbance, although it eventually comes to zero at the boundaries, may increase
indefinitely in other parts of the field.

9. It thus appears that Keivin’s researches must be regarded as having failed
to demonstrate stability even for infinitesimal disturbances, although they make this
conclusion probable. Since the difficulty, according to the argument just given, arises
solely from the fact that (22) is not compatible with the satisfaction of both boundary
conditions throughout all time, it evidently lies in the unknown action of the boundaries,
from which vorticity must be conducted” into the fluid (this is the physical explanation
of the necessity of a supplementary solution) in order that the boundary conditions may
be satisfied. Krxvin’s investigation fails because it omits to study the details of this
boundary conduction.
The same objection applies to an investigation by Oswen, in which a solution of (14)
is obtained in the form*

expression satisfies (14) when U = fy, and that it reduces for (t= 0) to a vortex concentrated at one
