the aid of light or heat. We have, therefore, conclusive evidence that the resistance
is not merely that of the pivot (which, in fact, is 80 small as to be inappreciable); and
the only other resistance of which we know*Â® is that of the air. But this is not all.

The behaviour of the mill furnishes us with the exact law of the resistance ; and this
is identical with the law of the resistance of air in a highly rarefied condition, a law
distinctly special in its character.

The resistance which bodies experience in moving through the atmosphere at consi-
derable velocities is proportional to the square of the velocity ; but if the velocity is
very small, less than one tenth of a foot per second, then, as Prof. SrokEs has shown,
the resistance is nearly proportional to the velocity, Now, s0 faras this latter resistance
goes, Prof. MaxwerL has shown the singular fact that, although it depends on the
nature, it is independent of the density of the air or gas. A body moving at a very
small velocity would therefore experience the same resistance whether moving outside
or within the receiver of an air-pump in which the air was highly rarefied, the only
difference being that the speed for which the resistance continues proportional to the
velocity is higher in proportion as the tension of the air is reduced.

1f, therefore, the vanes of the light-mill were moving in air as dense as the atmosphere
they would experience a resistance increasing with this speed according to a law yarying
from the velocity at low speed to the 8quare of the velocity at high speeds; but since
they move in an exceedingly rare medium, the resistance which it offers is more nearly
Proportional to the velocity throughout, and only at the highest speeds can there be any
appreciable deviation from this law.
