sense specified in §4, for though a curve represented by the curve-factor in any

transformation might have no discontinuity of direction in the full linear range there
would be discontinuities in the analytical form of the equation to the curve at
the extremities of the inner range.

This illustrates the fact that a curve-factor, which, for its total linear range
of curvilinearity, is not necessarily simple, may have branch-points not only at
the extremities of the linear range but also at points within the range. If the
general character of the types already chiefly considered is to be maintained in such
a multiple curve-factor, the net effect of proceeding along the real axis of w with a
suitable detour round each branch-point must be simply a change of sign when the
whole range has been traversed. ‘Thus the formula

indices are positive, and
