Fine, undisturbed lamination signifies that no organisms burrowed within the sediment. Nor did macro-organisms crawl about on the surface, since even this would suffice to
destroy laminae less than 1 mm thick. These facts are well known and bituminous shales
like those of Dorset are sometimes referred to as euxinic deposits. On the other hand, the
absence of lamination in fine-grained sediments is clear evidence that material has been
reworked by burrowing animals (Dapples 1942; Schafer 1956). In the case of the Blue
Lias the interpretation is straightforward, for the normal limestones and marls usually
contain ample evidence of organisms, both as body and trace-fossils.
