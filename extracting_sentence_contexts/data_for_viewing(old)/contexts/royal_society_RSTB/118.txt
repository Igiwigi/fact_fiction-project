regarded as indicating a Carnivorous type, probably Marsupial. The ulna and
radius in their proximal ends and general character correspond with Carnivora and
Lemuroids, but in their distal ends are more like certain Rodents and the Monotreme
Echidna. This I take to indicate that there may have been no supination, and that
the distal extremities of the bones acquired their modification after the Carnivorous
characteristic had been developed. Some caution may be needed in drawing
inferences from the carpus, because the bones are not all in natural articulation.
But the presence of the bones of the central series seems beyond question, The
prevalence of the central ossification in the Quadrumana, Lemuroidea, and certain
Rodents points to a collateral affinity with those groups, the former two of which
have obvious points of contact with Carnivora. The absence of the centrale in
the Monotremata and Marsupialia suggests that, if Theriodesmus is not Placental,
it has no close kinship with any surviving type of Marsupial, while the fact that
as many as three central bones are present, tends to show that it is of a more
ancient stock, even if it should prove to be an offshoot from the Lemuroid division
of Mammalia. The close general rememblance of the carpus, but for the central
bones, to the carpus of a Carnivore is suggestive of relations to the Carnivora as well.
The metacarpus is that of a Carnivore like the Otter, simplified in details in a way
found among Marsupials. The phalanges are short as in terrestrial Chelonians, and
have the superior surfaces but little modified, indicating a plantigrade movement, or
very little motion between the phalanges of the digits.

Hence I conclude that this fossil cannot be placed in any defined ans of existing
Mammals. It would appear to belong to that group or sub-class which Professor
Corr has named Bunotheria, but not to any order of it which has been indicated.
