On such a view of the process of crystallisation during cooling as is above
indicated, it will be seen that a structure identical in form with that observed in the
Widmanstiitten figures and similar in composition to that shown by the magnetic
properties is explicable. The fact that the breadth of the layers of kamacite some-
times varies from one part of a meteorite to another would be explained by difference
in the rate of cooling, or in the manner of deposition of nuclei in different parts of
the material. The fact that the average thickness of the kamacite bands decreases
as the total percentage of nickel in the material increases can be explained in the
same way. Thus, for example, in a meteorite containing a relatively high percentage
of nickel, e.g., 12 per cent., the whole material will exist “uncrystallised” until a
temperature in the neighbourhood of 300° C. is reached. When this temperature—
the temperature of lability of the metastable solid solution—is attained, crystallisa-
tion will begin; but the rate of growth round the original nuclei will be so slow (on
account of the lowness of temperature) that, unless the rate of cooling is excessively
slow, there will be a succession of returns to the state of lability during cooling.
