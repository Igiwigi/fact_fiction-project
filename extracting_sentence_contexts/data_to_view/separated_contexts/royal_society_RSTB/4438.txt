I therefore submitted specimens to Prof. F. O. BowEr, who reported them to be
“either Melobesia or some Melobesia-like organism.” To obtain a more precise
identification I submitted them to Dr. A. B. Renpie and Mr. A. Grrr, of the
Natural History Museum, who recommended, in order to secure the most authorita-
tive available opinion on their nature, that they should be sent to Madame Lemorne,
of Paris. She kindly examined the material and identified the section from Ballinasloe
as unquestionably a Lithothamnium,

Most of the calcareous encrustations in the eskers are no doubt inorganic, as shown
by the fact that in some layers they occur only on the under surfaces ; in others they
have cemented grains of grit and small stones to the boulders. But Madame
Lemornr’s identification shows that some of these encrustations are algal and marine
in origin. Others may have had the same formation, but have been so altered by
percolating water that any organic structure has been destroyed.*
