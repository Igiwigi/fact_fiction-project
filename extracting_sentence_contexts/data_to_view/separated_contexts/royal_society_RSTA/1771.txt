These two signals have both
signals from fibre and others. The signal from fibre orientation has a larger amplitude, and the
phase is significantly shifted. Based on this fact, the ECT signal from the fibre is distinguished
from others by rotating the phases of Vx and Vy in the complex plane using a rotation matrix. In
the case of CirD (w = 90), a phase-rotated Vy signal was used for the evaluation protocol as shown
in figure 8. After phase rotation, the spatial frequency spectrum of the contour map of the ECT signal
was analysed by applying spatial Fast Fourier Transform (2D-FFT).
