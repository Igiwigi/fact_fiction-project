Mr. SurrH came to the conelusion that since the fossil Fungi which he described
possessed, as he believed, septate hypha and oogonia containing oospores, they must
be ranked with the Peronosporee. I confess that I cannot confirm the alleged facts nor
accept the inference drawn from them. That the plant is a Fungus seems most pro-
bable : equally s0 that its relations are with the Saprolegniee. The discovery of its
reproductive organs in a more perfect state will alone enable us to arrive at a ps
satisfactory conclusion on this point.
