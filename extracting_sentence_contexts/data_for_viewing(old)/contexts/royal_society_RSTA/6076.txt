there too.

In summary, while we do not present a concrete theory that accounts in full detail for the
outstanding astrophysical issues of the day, namely the dark matter and dark energy problems,
we have shown how the vacuum solutions of a conformally invariant fourth-order theory make
an immediate contact with these issues. The conformal invariance, the absence of G in the
gravitational Lagrangian and the vacuum aspect of the solutions of the theory still need to be
integrated into a coherent scheme that can address astrophysical issues in detail. On the other
hand, the same principle indicates, at the same time, a potential way around some of the issues
that have vexed GR and generally second-order gravitational theories over many years, such as
the singularities and the information paradox in black hole evaporation. In answer to the question
in the title of this article, we conjecture that the road to potential progress in all these issues may
in fact be through conformal invariance.
