For the sete distal to about the middle point of the second
endite, the corresponding comb setules occur on the second and following endites of
the limb behind. For the sete of the proximal half of the second endite the comb
setules are represented by the row of stout setules on the claw ridge of the gnathobase
behind. That this is the method of functioning of these setules is supported by the
fact that on the first trunk limb, which is, of course, not overlapped by filter sete, the
comb setules have practically disappeared (see above, para. 2). The comb setules for
the fifth trunk limb occur as a row of stout setules on the gnathobase of the sixth limb

and as a mat of finer setules which extends up the endite lobe. The food particles having been retained from the water-currents in this manner will

be sucked towards the mid-ventral groove.
