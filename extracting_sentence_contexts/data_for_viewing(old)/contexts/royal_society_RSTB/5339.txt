vertebree in 8-day chick bear amphiccelous character.

It is evident that all above-mentioned authors agree in this, that the first deformation
of the notochord observed in the chick embryo is represented by intervertebral con-
strictions and intravertebral dilatations, and that these deformations do not appear
earlier than on the 5th day of development. This, in connection with the fact that
none of the later investigators known to the writer, who deal with the early development
of the chick or of other birds, have described a stage in the evolution of the form of the
notochord earlier and different from these just mentioned, renders the observation of
intrasclerotomie dilatations and intersclerotomic constrictions on the notochord of the
3- and 4-day Larus very interesting.

The fact that the shape of the notochord remains unaltered before the beginning of
the formation of the system of the perichordal rings renders it highly probable that. the
deformation of the notochord is not caused by internal but external forces. The most
intimate environmental factor for the developing notochord is, of course, that portion
of the series of sclerotomes which closely surrounds the notochordâ€”the perichordal
rings or the perichordal tube, consisting of fused perichordal rings. The moniliform
differentiation of the notochord during the 3rd and 4th day may be explained by the
unequal growth of the different segments of the perichordal tube. It may be assumed
that the perichordal rings once formed protect the underlying notochord from com-
pression and diminution of volume. On the contrary, the portions of the notochord
enclosed by the rapidly growing mass of mesenchymatous tissue filling up the intervals
between successive perichordal rings become constricted.
