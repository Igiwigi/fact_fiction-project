But experiments also
show that a substantial proportion of people choose a glaringly incorrect
answer to a simple question when told it is the answer others have chosen,
even though the same question is answered correctly in isolation (e.g. [19]). In a sporting setting, goalkeepers facing penalties tend to dive, rather than
stay in the middle of the goal, more than the direction of penalties suggests
is appropriate [20]. Such types of behaviour reflect the fact that people are
unwilling to risk failure by pursuing strategies that are different from the
norm. The penalty of failure may be less if others fail in the same wayâ€”as
Keynes pointed out was true of banks. People have excessive faith in their own judgements and are subject to
confirmation bias and wishful thinking.
