Here the agreement between the experimental results and those obtained by theory
is very fair at the lower frequencies but not at 500~. ‘These 500 ~ results were only
obtained during the last few days before the station closed, and there was no oppor-
tunity for thoroughly examining and eliminating disturbances.

This rate of diminution with depth is much greater than that found by H. Licurs
at Kiel, but it would appear that he worked in the cold water of the Baltic, so that the
resistivity must have been much higher, and in fact he gives it as having been 100 ohms
per cm.* But the agreement between theory and experiment is sufficiently good to
allow of the former being used with confidence.

By the principle of similitude mentioned on p. 98, the results for a given depth and
frequency should be the same as for another depth and frequency provided d ,/f is the
same in both cases. In fig. 25 the whole of the values of H/H, and of the phase lag
¢ have been plotted against d ,/f and the majority of the observations lie fairly well
on the two lines.

Effect of Cable Armouring.—Reference has already been made to the concentration
of the return current in the a armouring owing to its superior conductivity and to the
skin effect, so that the effective current in an armoured cable may be much less than
