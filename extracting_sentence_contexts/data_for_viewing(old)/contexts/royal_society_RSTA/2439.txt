Ss (4.1)
For x > 0.125, following the band evolution of Co,_,Fe,S2, the Seebeck coefficient would thus
reflect the majority band only. On the other hand, for x = 0, the two bands contribute and formula
(4.1) should apply. The peak of S would therefore result from the deviation from half-metallicity,
which is associated with the increase of N(Ep) as x decreases as probed by NMR and specific
heat [10].

At T > Tc, the remarkable point with respect to the thermoelectric properties is that the value
of S at 300K is not affected by the Fe concentration. S can be described as T+T'/? for all the
samples, and its value is almost independent of x. The large value of S previously discussed in
CoS of approximately equal to —42 1 V K~! at 300 K could be due to the fact that Ef sits on a steep
slope of the Density of States (DOS) according to [14].

As shown in figure 6, the Fe substitution is efficient to reduce the thermal conductivity in
the whole temperature range, down to approximately equal to 7.9Wm~!K~! at 300K. This
reduction is mostly induced by electronic contributions coming from the increase of electrical
resistivity. No significant effect of the Fe composition over the lattice thermal conductivity can be
observed. From the Méssbauer spectra (figure 9), the Debye temperature was found to be equal
to (440 + 15) K for x =0.30, very close to the values extracted from specific heat experiments [23].
Following the classical theory of heat transport, a peak on xj, is expected near T+ @p/5, which
is in good agreement with the peak observed here at approximately 80 K. The magnetic transition
has obviously a huge impact on the electronic part but is unexpectedly also observed on the lattice
part for x = 0 (electronic supplementary material, figure S2), and even with a small change of slope
