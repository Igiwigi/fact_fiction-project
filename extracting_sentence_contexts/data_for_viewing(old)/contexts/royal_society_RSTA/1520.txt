The impact of the chaotic nature of molecular dynamics has not been widely recognized in the

molecular dynamics field. Most accounts give surprisingly short shrift to it, a notable exception :2
being the recent book by Leimkuhler and Matthews [31], albeit it does not address the issue of : S
uncertainty quantification and the estimation of thermodynamic quantities. Extensive studies we : Ss
have performed in recent years show that molecular dynamics systems indeed exhibit extreme : =
sensitivity to initial conditions [46-49]. From our investigations, we observe that the properties :8
one computes from molecular dynamics trajectories appear superficially to be described by a [3
Gaussian random process (GRP) with a normal distribution denoted by N(u,07), characterized : 3
by average p and standard deviation o (the square root of the variance in the data). Note, : Ss
however, that a normal distribution cannot be assumed and in fact there are frequently significant : =
deviations from such statistics in nonlinear dynamical systems of which molecular dynamics is â€œ8

an excellent example [50].

In a recent study, for example, the effect of box size on simulations of protein dynamics in
water was reported [51]; the authors reported that calculated values of various properties, such
as the stabilities of the unliganded and liganded states of human haemoglobin and the density
or number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule, changed systematically with an increase in
box size; the authors maintained that a surprisingly large box of 150 A was required to obtain
meaningful results. Although at first sight, this dependency on the box size appears to be an
example of a systematic error in the simulation, it is in fact caused by a lack of reproducibility in
the study which becomes manifest when random errors are taken into account [52]. Indeed, the
