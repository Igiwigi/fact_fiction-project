The remarkable effects that one often sees on rotating a section under oblique
3, light are due to these serrations. { The fact that the pitted crystals give this rotation
effect, shows that the sides of the pits have a definite orientation. The variation in
the appearance of different crystals of the same substance, dependent on their orienta-
tion to the plane of polishing, is liable to mislead anyone who trusts to microscopic
study only. For example, the alloy with 27Â°2 atoms photographed with normal
light (fig. 15) appears to consist.
