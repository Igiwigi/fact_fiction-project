In his idea, depicted in figure 3, a photon enters an interferometer that can be arranged
according to two alternative configurations. If the interferometer is closed, one can observe
an interference pattern, reflecting the fact that the photon travelled both routes at the same
time, as a classical wave. If the interferometer is left open, then the two detectors show a
flat probability distribution in the recorded clicks, reflecting the fact that the photon travelled
along only one arm of the interferometer, as a classical particle. The mutual exclusivity of
the two experimental arrangements needed for observing the two complementary behaviours
allows one to consider the photon to be either a wave or a particle at any moment of the
experiment. To prevent any causal link between the configuration choice and the photonâ€™s
behaviour, Wheeler proposed to delay the final setting of the apparatus until after the
photon had already entered the interferometer, preventing it from knowing beforehand how
to behave.
