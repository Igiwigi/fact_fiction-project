There is strong negative evidence that the Belemnite possessed borny mandibles like
the other naked Cephalopods, since no calcareons beaks, or Rhyncholites, have been
discovered associated with the specimens from the Oxford clay, or with those from
the lias. The thickness of the layer of dried and compressed grey fibrous matter to which the
mantle is reduced is half a line, and we may infer from this, that in its soft and re-
cent state, when permeated by its sanguiferons vessels, it mnst have equalled in thick-
ness that of a Calamary of the same size. In fact the mantle of true Teuthide
(Calamaries with horny pens), preserved in the same matrix as the Belemnites here
described, has been reduced to a compact fibrous layer of the same thinness: a
specimen of one of these} displays by a fracture of the layer of the clay in which it
was imbedded, the anterior and posterior walls with the intervening cavity of the
abdomen, exposing the ink-bag and duct in situ. * PL IV. fig. 1.
