Before moving on, let us mention some promising Modern Perspectives in Proof Theory, which
in an ideal world would have also been covered in this issue.

(a) Provability logic and its models

Provability logic studies the abstract properties of the provability relation. A good source for the
subject is Boolos [12]. By using the tools of modal logic, one can state simple facts about it, such
as Gédel’s incompleteness theorem:

oT > OO,

an instance of the more general Léb axiom, O(O¢ > ¢) > Di. Solovay [13] proved that the
provability logic of Peano Arithmetic can be axiomatized by Kripke’s axiom K, Léb’s axiom and
the rules modus ponens and necessitation. The resulting modal system is called GL.
