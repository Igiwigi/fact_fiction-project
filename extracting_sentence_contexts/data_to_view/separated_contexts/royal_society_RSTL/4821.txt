Allyl-alcohol.

& Oletiant gas and its homologues are capable of furnishing mono-acid alcohols by another
reaction, which has not yet been applied to the series of bodies homologous with marsh-
gas. In fact, we have learnt by the researches of M. BerTHELoT, that olefiant gas and
its homologues are capable of being transformed into alcohols by the absorption of two
equivalents of water ; olefiant gas furnishes by this reaction ordinary alcohol ; and
propylene, propylic alcohol ; thus—
