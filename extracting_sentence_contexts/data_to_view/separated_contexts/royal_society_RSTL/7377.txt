A piece of the ordinary sensitized paper, such as is used for photographic printing,
when exposed to the action of the light for twenty seconds, at a distance of 2 feet from
the reflector, was darkened to the same degree as was a piece of the same sheet of paper
when exposed for a period of one minute to the direct rays of the sun, at noon, on a very
clear day in the month of March. 81. The extraordinary calorific and illuminating powers of the 10-inch machine are
all the more remarkable from the fact that they have their origin in six small perma-
nent magnets, weighing only 11b. each (12), and only capable, at most, of sustaining
collectively a weight of 60 Ibs. ; while the electricity from the magneto-electric machine
which was employed in exciting the electro-magnet was, of itself, incapable of heating
to redness the shortest length of iron wire of the smallest size manufactured. 82.
