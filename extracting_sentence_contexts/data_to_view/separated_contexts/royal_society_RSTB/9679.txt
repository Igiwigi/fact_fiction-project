In light of the tight association of
impairments in personality functioning and impairments of
social interaction, future research could, therefore, focus on
the study of interaction-based social rewards to search for
disorder-specific differences and how those interact with
social cognitive abilities, but could also be used to characterize
this interplay in a transdiagnostic manner.

(c) The case of depression

Depression is a highly prevalent mental disorder that is
characterized by low mood, anhedonia and decreased
activity. Furthermore, depression is associated with abnor-
mally increased, self-defeating thoughts and self-referential
concerns, which are known to contribute to dysfunctional
interpersonal expectations and thereby make successful par-
ticipation in social interaction difficult [67]. In particular,
individuals with depression lose the sense of having an
impact on other people, while, in fact, they do. Since social
interactions are normally experienced as intrinsically reward-
ing [22], unsuccessful or reduced social interactions can
further contribute to depressive symptomatology and its pro-
longation [68]. But as in all cases of psychiatric disorders,
depressive symptomatology will also affect the interaction
partners of patients: from a clinical perspective, it is well
recognized that depressive symptoms in a person are likely
to trigger support and encouragement from others to which
the depressed individual cannot respond adequately.
