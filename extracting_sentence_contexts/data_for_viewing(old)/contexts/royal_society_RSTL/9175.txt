S ganglia and the point of the bell from which the polypite is 8uspended. In other words,
RS the marginal ganglia do not respond to any amount of disturbance that may be set up
5 in the polypite itself, provided the contraction of this organ does not cause it to pull
A upon the point of its attachment with the bell. Now the high degree of sensitiveness

8hown by the ganglia to the smallest degree of such traction is quite as remarkable as
is their lack of sensitiveness to disturbances going on in the polypite*. Consequently

* When a specimen of Sarsic is taken out of the water, laid on an object-glass, slit open along one side, and
spread out flat with its inner surface uppermost, and then has its polypite turned back as represented in the figure
on Þ. 697, it may be obseryed that the bell often responds to irritations of the polypite, even thongh care be taken
to release the latter from the forceps before it is allowed to pull on its point of suspension. This may possibly
be due to the fact of the polypite mecting with some frietion on the glass during its process of retraction, which
friction must eanss it to pull very «lightly on its point of snspension, At any rate, if it is due to neryous con-

we have in this a very conclusive proof of the truly reflex character of the action we
are considering ; for after the removal of the marginal ganglia, the mutilated nectocalyx,
