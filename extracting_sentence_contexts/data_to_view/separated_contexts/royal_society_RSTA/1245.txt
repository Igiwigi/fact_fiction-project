280 EARL OF BERKELEY AND EB. STENHOUSE; DENSITY OF VAPOURS IN EQUILIBRIUM

For the same substance at the same temperature we have the following three sets of
experiments (10), (11) and (12), where clearly the faster air current carries away less
vapour from the second vessel. (8) and (18) also follow the rule, but the figures are somewhat complicated by the
fact that in (13) the water was in vessel 4, but we may assume that if the water had been
in 2, the loss would have been 0018 x 1-6 = 0029.
