Assume that there exists a quasi-interior point u in L? with the following two properties:

(1) There exists a time to such that, for each f €L?, the modulus |S(to)f| is dominated by an
(f-dependent) multiple of u.

(2) The largest spectral value of the generator A is an eigenvalue whose eigenspace is spanned by a
function w that satisfies w > cu for a number c > 0. Then there exists ty > 0 such that S(t) > 0 for all t > ty. In fact, ty can be chosen such that, for each 0 <f €
L?(@,u) and each t > ty, the function S(t)f even dominates a strictly positive multiple of u. Proof. This was proved in [51, Corollary 3.5]. a

The property that, for all sufficiently large times t and all non-zero f > 0, the function S(f)f is
not only positive but dominates a non-zero multiple of u, can be interpreted as a rather strong
irreducibility property.
