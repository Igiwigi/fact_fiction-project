Ais frequently changed. If the wire is simply left standing in air at a low pressure for

ea long time the leak is often greater than before on again heating the wire. The

Eprocess of cleaning the wire with nitric acid and frequently changing the air in the

-gapparatus diminishes the negative leak something like a thousand times usually.

SThus the leaks given above are about one thousand times smaller than those given
by RicHarpson at the same temperatures.

8 These facts naturally suggest the question whether more thorough cleaning of the
wire and purification of the air would not still further diminish the negative leak.
To test this a wire was mounted as before and boiled in HNO, for about an hour. It
was then left in the HNO, for 24 hours and a current passed from the wire to the
cylinder through the HNO,, so that the NO, ions were set free on the wire. The
tube was then washed out and the leak measured in pure air at a low pressure, as
before. The following table gives the results obtained :â€”
