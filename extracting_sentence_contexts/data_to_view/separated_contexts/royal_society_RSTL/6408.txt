It is very curious
that there are in the 26th bed at Bovey leaves which are granulated in this manner; and
one of them is very near to Ficus scabriuscula, Hr. I therefore believe that T am not
mistaken in ranging these three species under the genus Ficus. The following facts
indicate that the granulation belongs to the leaf and not to the stone:â€”1. The stone
certainly is finely granulated ; but these granules are larger than the small points of the
leaves, which can only be seen with the aid of a lens, and which are all of the same size;
2. they are regularly spread over the surface of the leaf; 3. they are on all the pieces
of this species, but not on the leaves of other plants (e. g. Cinnamonum lanceolatum,
Daphnogene Ungeri, and Lastrea Bunburis), which are lying in the same clay.
