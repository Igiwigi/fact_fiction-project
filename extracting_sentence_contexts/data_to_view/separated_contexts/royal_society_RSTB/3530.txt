In Phot. 33, Plate 5, is a high-power illustration of the supposed ovule a, which
shows the character and arrangement of the cells composing it. These resemble more
closely those found in a tangential section of an ovule than they do the mesophyll
tissue of a scale. The general tissues of this scale are not so mature and hardened,
nor is there the same development of vascular tissues as in the ripe scales from which
the seeds have fallen; facts which support the view that the structures under
discussion are aborted organs. Such aborted ovules not infrequently occur at the
tips of living cones, so that it is natural enough that they should be found in fossil
material. While from their somewhat problematical nature these structures do not determine

the question of the number of seeds borne by each scale, yet they are not at variance
with, and indeed rather lend additional support to, the view that the number was
three, or at any rate not less than two.
