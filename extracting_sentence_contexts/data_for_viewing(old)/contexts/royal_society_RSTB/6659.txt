Although the problem of host selection in insects is one which has received consider-
able attention from various workers within the last twenty-five years, no agreement
has yet been reached on the general factors involved in this selection. Apart from its
purely academic interest to the insect physiologist, the fact that certain species of
insects are restricted to one given host, while others attack numerous species, is one
of considerable practical importance. Recently attempts have been made to determine
the precise nature of the attraction exercised by hosts on their known insect parasites
with a view to the utilization of the knowledge in problems of biological control. Thus,
it is thought that if the factors which determine the oviposition response of a given
parasite can be found it should be possible to predict the hosts of this parasite in any
given environment.

Both monophagous and polyphagous parasites are known to select appropriate hosts
for oviposition, but it was assumed that in a population of any single host species, a
parasite laid its eggs without reference to the nature of the hosts available. This
