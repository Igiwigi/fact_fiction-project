For the long-wavelength region where the Drude expression for the dielectric constant (1.1) is
valid, once again one can use the expression for the real ef, ~ —o /w? and imaginary e/, © oy /o

It is easy to see (table 1) that the noble metals have higher values of FOM than most if not all ‘new’
plasmonic materials all the way to the far IR range, just as numerical simulations in [15] have shown.
To illustrate this fact, we perform full modelling of the dispersion and propagation length in
gap SPPs for gold and InGaAs waveguides with an SiO2 core. The results are shown in figure 5.
The propagation constant (effective) index 8 of the gap SPP shown in figure 5a,c remains equal to


ka for as long as a > Ap/2z and then gradually increases as the field starts penetrating the metal
(semiconductor). The propagation length indeed increases proportionally to the gap thickness.
For the metal (figure 5b) it is almost independent of the wavelength, in full agreement with (4.11),
while for InGaAs (figure 5d) the propagation length does depend on the wavelength. This can
be explained by the fact that, when the wavelength approaches the plasma wavelength, the field
penetrates deep inside the semiconductor. At any rate, comparing figure 5b,d one can see that the
propagation length in metal always exceeds that in semiconductor despite higher material loss in
the metal.
