Finally, she described the important interplay between water and energy and : &

that the efficient use and purification of water will become increasingly important. Overall, she
stressed the important role that catalysis had to play in addressing the energy trilemma, ie. the
need for a sustainable, affordable and secure supply. Johannes Lercher (Technical University Munich, Germany/Pacific North West National
Laboratory, USA) started his talk by re-emphasizing some of the points made by others about
the fact that the impact of changing our energy utilization must be in the fuels area and not
chemicals. While improvements and developments in the latter are important the overall impact
will be small. In addition, he discussed the relative importance of different energy vectors in
terms of carbon and energy conversion such as nuclear, photosynthesis to biomass, fossil fuels
and hydroelectric.
