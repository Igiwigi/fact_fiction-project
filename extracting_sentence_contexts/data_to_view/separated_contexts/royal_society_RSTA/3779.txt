This resembles the angular momentum r x ¢ associated with the rotation of a particle’s position
vector r, say. At first glance, then, it might appear that chirality and the angular momentum of light are
disparate subjects: chirality is the concept of handedness while the angular momentum of light,
in particular spin, is associated with rotation rather than any form of inversion. Developments
in recent years have revealed, however, that these two fields are, in fact, subtly intertwined. The
purpose of this short paper is to elucidate and consolidate some of the advances in this direction. In what follows, we consider ourselves to be in an inertial frame of reference, adopting a right-
handed Cartesian coordinate system x,y,z with time t.
