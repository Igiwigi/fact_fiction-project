function of argument v to one of argument 1/v, used in § 6, is that

arg (—v)|<n.
(—v) is thus interpreted as v exp (—im), since
O<argu=e<}n.

Ife<0, a different transformation formula is obtained; —v must be interpreted as v exp (im).
In fact, the hypergeometric function possesses branch-points at 1 and infinity (Copson 1935,
chap. 10), and the transformation formula is valid in the whole plane only when cut along
the real axis from 1 to +00. E, thus has a singularity at v = 1, that is, where Y = 1—iZ.
If Z = 0, this occurs for a real value of the height z, and for values of z greater than this,
the value of E, is ambiguous (by this method of solution). In practice, Z is always greater
than zero, so the singularity does not occur on the real z-axis and analytic continuation
along the real z-axis is possible. Hence the formulae can only be regarded as valid if ¢— 0
through positive values, the case ¢ = 0 exactly being impossible physically, and, by this
method of solution, ambiguous mathematically.

The following physical argument to explain the paradox was suggested by Dr K. G.
Budden.
