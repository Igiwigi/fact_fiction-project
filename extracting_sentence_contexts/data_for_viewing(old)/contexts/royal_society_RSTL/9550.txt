Fig. 53 represents another of these objects, the extreme diameter of the disk of which,
exclusive of the radiating arms, is '0018. The arms in this example are rather shorter
than in the las one. The section has here passed tangentially through the upper-
most portion of the disk—hence we see at « the bases of arms springing at regular
intervals from what remains of its convex surface. Fig. 56 is a less highly magnified
figure of a much larger specimen, the disk of which has a diameter of 006. Ib is

existence of 8uch a membrane in several of my specimens, leaving no room for doubting
