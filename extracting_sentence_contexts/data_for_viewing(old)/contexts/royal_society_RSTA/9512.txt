disappears at the fusion point and corresponds to the latent heat (as described
above).

The departure of the specific heat from the value calculated on DEpyr’s theory is
important in connection with the quantum theory, for if the latter be valid, the
above term, due to the rotation of the molecules, implies that the angular velocities
of the molecules go in definite units. We cannot have the quantum theory holding
for translational motion and not for rotational. The remarkable fact is that the
rotational term (17) is insignificant except near the fusion point. This means that
away from the fusion point the translational motion of the molecules is sufficient to
