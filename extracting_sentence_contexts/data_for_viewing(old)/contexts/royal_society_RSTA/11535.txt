192 CAPTAIN ABNEY ON THE SENSITIVENESS

19. Relative Sensitiveness of the Different Parts of the Retina.

One other determination of sensitiveness of the retina required to be made, viz.,
the general sensitiveness at all parts compared with that at the centre or close
to the yellow spot. In “ Colour Photometry,” Part III, a comparison was made
of the sensitiveness of the centre of the eye compared with that of a point 10°
towards the periphery. Determinations of this kind are extremely difficult, and it
is only by continued observation that an approach to correct measures can be made.
In fact the eye requires training. Perhaps the easiest plan of explaining how the
following determinations were made will be by describing a preliminary experiment.
Procure a large sheet of black paper and lay it horizontally on a table near a window,
so that it is equally illuminated. Cut out some small and equal discs of white paper
or card and place two of them about 1 foot apart lying on the black paper. Place
the eye about 12 inches above one of them, and receive its image on the centre
of the retina. At the same time the image of the other will be received on the
retina about 45° from the centre. This last white dise will appear to be very
decidedly darker than the first.

Cut out a small dise in grey paper, and substitute it for the white disc, the image of
which is viewed centrally. The other white disc may now be moved away from it till
the two appear equally luminous. The distance from the grey dise to the white will
