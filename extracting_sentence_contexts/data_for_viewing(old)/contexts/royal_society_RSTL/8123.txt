D the head. Large anterior cerebral lobes may be the cause of a retreating forehead, by
5 causing rotation backwards, for they will add to the weight of the fore part of the head
E as-much as heavy jaws would : but if the cranial curvature be not deficient, the rotation
= consequent on the weight in front will give a rounded appearance to the lower back

part of the skull, by lowering the position of the occipital tuberosity. The physiogno-
mical effect of this is very important. Much is said of the physiognomic value of a high
forehead, and little store is placed on fulness of the lower and back part of the head ;
but the artistic value of apparent occipital development is easily demonstrated by draw-
ing a profile and varying the limiting line of the lower part of the skull behind. The
* change of one line at this part may be made to convert an intelligent-looking head into
that of a weak-minded person, without alteration of a single feature of the face. The
anatomical fact which the change of line indicates is an arrest of development of the
whole brain, whether large or small, leaving the cranial curvature incomplete.


164 DR. J. CLELAND ON THE VARIATIONS OF THE HUMAN SKULL.

The question of the beauty of a high or low forehead in the representation of feminine
form receives elucidation from the principles laid down. The question is less one of
taste than one of anatomy, for the just proportions of the head in the two sexes are
as subject to law as those of the trunk. The child-like position of the feminine skull
on the vertebral column, dependent on the lightness of the face, and on that deficient
frontal capacity demonstrated by HuscuKE, combines with smallness of the postfora-
minal angle to cause the continuance of other peculiarities of the young head, viz. an
