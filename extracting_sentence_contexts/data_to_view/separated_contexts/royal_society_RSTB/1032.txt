Though I searched very closely I failed to determine
with certainty any body which might represent the male pronucleus, though the
spermatozoon had evidently penetrated the egg. The male pronucleus must be
exceedingly small and easily overlooked, otherwise it would be necessary to conclude
that the fusion of the two pronuclei takes place immediately after the first polar body
is formed (in which case it would be very rarely detected in ova which had given off
the first polar body) ; but this seems improbable, though traces of a male pronucleus
were never found in sections at any later phase, even in ova where the second polar
body was being or had just been given off, though many ova were examined, the
preservation and staining of which, as far as the chromatin elements were concerned,
were excellent. After the formation of the vitelline membrane and fertilization, the contents of the
egg contract considerably (figs. 3, 44); that this isa result of fertilization follows from
the fact that, while fertilized eggs contract, unfertilized ones remain uncontracted.*

The protoplasm now commences to undergo marked rhythmical contractions (figs.
44, 45), and after a time again swells somewhat; the clear area at the anterior end
becomes amesboid, and throws out short blunt pseudopodia (fig. 3), which are as often
retracted. A blunt process, similar at first to these, gradually rises higher, and eventually
becomes constricted off, and forms the second polar bodyt (figs. 4, 43). Sections at this stage show either a nucleus, or the second directive spindle close
to the surface (fig. 100), with its long axis parallel to that of the ovum.
