negligible in comparison with )*. Perhaps on account of the lack of suitable data, the
new formule were not applied to any single member of the vast array of optically active
organic compounds which have been prepared and studied, more especially from the
time of Pasteur onwards.

In view of the very limited application of these formule by Drupr himself, the
indefinite number of arbitrary constants which they contained, and the fact that a
complete knowledge of the refractive dispersion of the medium was presupposed, it is
not surprising that Drupr’s formule remained almost barren so far as their immediate
application to measurements of rotatory dispersion was concerned. Fifteen years of
work on rotatory dispersion (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ A, 1912, vol. 212, p. 261; ‘ Trans. Chem.
Soc.,’ 1913, vol. 103, p. 1062 et seg.) have, however, provided ample data for testing
the validity of these equations, and have established beyond question the fact that they
are adequate to meet all the requirements of the most diverse and of the most exact
measurements of rotatory dispersion. In the case of some scores of organic compounds,
