fact has its cause in the structure of the organ.

Whatever may be the microscopic characters of the nerve terminations in the plates,
-and the part which they play in the production of the excitatory electromotive
‘change, there is no evidence of any continuity of protoplasm between one plate and
dis neighbours. It appears that each plate is physiologically completely severed from
Bll other plates, In order, therefore, to secure the simultaneous response of a whole
-yolumn, either the nerve trunk supplying the column must be excited or an induction
“ghock must traverse all the septa of the column.

2 Experiments referring to Excitation by the Voltaic Current.

+s The use of the rheotome has thus revealed the fact that the passage of an induction
Seurrent through a strip of organ excites the tissue. In no single instance was such
-Ean excitatory phenomenon found to be absent. This being the case, it is evident that
Zunless care is taken to exclude this excitatory effect from influencing the galvano-
ie the passage of an induction current in opposite directions must be attended by
Sunequal galvanometric deflections. It is therefore essential to know, with regard to
pu Bors-Ruymonp’s experiments with induction currents, whether he used a rheotome
‘Swhich would exclude the response. There is no indication in his published works of
Ehis having done so; whilst in the case of the voltaic current the duration of his
Bshortest closing time is given as 03”. This must therefore include both the voltaic
Seurrent and any response, and the inequality noted may be thus accounted for, It
Sis moreover clear, as regards induction shocks, that, apart from the summation of
‘gexciting current and excitatory response, there is no evidence of there being any
