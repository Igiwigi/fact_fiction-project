the gold standard has now (at least in two jurisdictions)
been fundamentally questioned and rejected.

(c) Rapport between the expert and the jury

A further challenge for science in the courts is the rapport
between the jury and the expert. Forensic evidence needs to
be ‘[s]cientifically rigorous, but accessible’ [41, p. 2]. The
Turner rule allows the court to exclude evidence, even if it
is of probative value, if it is likely that it will influence the
jury unduly on a matter on which they ought to form their
own independent judgment [37]. It is a necessary way of
limiting the admissibility of expert evidence given the fact
that it is presented to lay people, who might defer to it too
readily. An important consideration when reviewing the role
of forensic evidence in the courts relates to the nature of
the scientific evidence and the degree to which it influences
the jurors—and there are three levels we can consider.

Introduced through expert evidence are sciences which
require an empirical analysis of the data; ‘a method that relies
on scientific instrumentation to provide quantitative data that
can mathematically represent results’ [42, p. 4]. Examples of
this are drug analysis, toxicology or DNA analysis. These are
distinct for their quantitative approach to evidence and the
