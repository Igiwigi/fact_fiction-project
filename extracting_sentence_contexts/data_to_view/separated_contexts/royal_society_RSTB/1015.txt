The posterior border of
the field appears to be short, and extends from the mid-dorsal line of the limb about
half-way up the thigh, across the flexor muscle-group to the mid-ventral line of the
limb in the lower third of the thigh. It is not easy to determine where the posterior
border joins the ventral border, partly because the line of direction of the two borders
is so similar, It is also partly for the same reason not easy to determine the point at
which the anterior border joins the ventral border. In fact, the exact limits of the
veritral border I have not been able to satisfactorily demonstrate. Individual variation â€”
is one of the difficulties standing in the way of the determination. The dorsal border
forms the most distal part of the mid-dorsal line of the limb, and extends to a little
below the level of the knee.
