But study of the morphology of
the synapse cannot by itself settle any of the questions about synaptic excitation. What
is known of the relationship of the fibres at such junctions is not inconsistent either
with the view that the excitation of one fibre by another is humoral, or that it is
accomplished by a process similar to that by which one part of a nerve fibre excites
another part of the same fibre, namely, by the “local electric circuits produced by the
activity of adjacent parts” (Hodgkin 1937a). An impulse arriving at the afferent side of a synapse is presumably not always able to
propagate further, as it would do over a continuous mass of neuroplasm, because of the
special electrical conditions set up by the fact that the two fibres do not freely mingle. It is not possible to specify at present exactly how the current would flow in such a
system, but certainly the absence of a continuous internal connexion between two

% This may also be true of cases such as that described recently by P. Glees Proc. Konin.
