IN the course of the adjustment and verification of the copies of the Imperial
standard yard, destined for the Exchequer, Guildhall, Dublin, and Edinburgh,
I discovered a source of error till then, I belieye, wholly unsuspected, arising
from the thickness of the bar upon the surface of which measures of linear
dimension are traced. The difficulties which I experienced, and the remedy
which suggested itself upon that occasion, and which was found efficient, are
$shortly detailed in the account of the construction and adjustment of the new
standards of weights and measures of the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Ireland, published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1826.

But as the notice there given occupies little more than a single page, and
might therefore pass unremarked, I cannot but think that a fact of such im-
portance in inquiries where linear measures are concerned, and which may be
sufficient to account for the discrepancies to be found in the experiments of
different observers, ought to be placed before the Royal Society in a more pro-
minent point of view than that which it at present occupies. I shall, therefore,
first extract from the paper alluded to the part to which I refer, and then add
an account of such experiments as I have since made on the subject ; and
describe a scale which I have caused to be constructed $0 as almost entirely
to obviate the source of error of which I am treating.

It may be seen in the paper before mentioned, © On the Construction of the
Standard Measures,” that Sir GzoxGs SHUckBURGH's scale was employed as
the medium of comparison ; the distance from the zero point of which to that
