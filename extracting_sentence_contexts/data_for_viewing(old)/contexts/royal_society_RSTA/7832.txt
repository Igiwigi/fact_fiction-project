Thus A has no factor 1 — z. The number of factors 1 — z in II [a, + h —r] ! is

x (a, +h—r)=3+(4),

kh
hence ¢ has the factor (1 — 2%), and therefore the factor II [«, — x, —7r-+ ¢].
rt

No other factor is possible for this is of the same order as ¢, and the numerical
factor to be attached is easily seen to be unity. Hence, according to definition

The fact that f,..,.. op is always an integer is not sufficient; for instance, the
