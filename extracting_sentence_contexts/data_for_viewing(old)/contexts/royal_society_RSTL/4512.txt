In the case of double decompoxsition, each of the four substances which enter into
the change is combined, but it does not appear that this state of combination is
necessary to the action. It can take place also, and in the same manner, when the
combining substances are only in contact with each other, and not in combination,
provided always that there is the right chemical difference between them, which
however is essential. Thus, for example, when iodine and phosphorus decompose
water (in the usual mode of the formation of hydriodic acid), the chemical relation
between the iodine and phosphorus is an essential condition of the action. The same
remark applies to the decomposition of water between nitric oxide and chlorine,
which can be effected by neither body separately ; 80 that the changes which take
place in these experiments are not simply due to the fact that the chlorine or iodine
Â£tand in one relation to water, or to the elements of water, and the nitric oxide or
pbosphorus in another, and that thus the water breaks up, being acted upon by two
opposite forces ; but that there is also, and must be, a certain chemical difference
between the chlorine and nitric oxide and between the iodine and phosphorus, which
is as essential and important a condition to the propagation of the action as their re-
lation to the water itself, and indeed without which they could not have this relation.
I am not aware that this remark has before been made, nor do I think it likely that
it Should have been made, but upon the view which I have given, of which it is a
consequence.

Facts corresponding to these cases of composition are to be obseryed, as might be
expected, in the decomposition of bodies, for if decomposition be the condition of
