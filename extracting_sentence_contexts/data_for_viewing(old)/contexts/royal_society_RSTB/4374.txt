transverse line. The distance between the mid-points on the mesial alveolar margins
of the two canine teeth is 40 mm. measured in a straight line. In a special investi-
gation by the writer of over 300 recent crania, mainly of Australians and Melanesians,
the maximum distance observed between these points was 37 mm,, in the large
cranium of an adult male Australian in the Australian Museum (No. 1257). This
excessive size is, of course, another manifestation of the great squareness of the pre-
maxillary part of the jaw, of which mention has already been made. In this area
of the alveolar margin lie the necks and very small portions of the crowns of the
four incisor teeth, but no evidence of any abnormal distance between canine and
lateral incisor is discernible. The radiographs (Plate 17, fig. 23) show that this
region of the jaw is completely occupied by the alveoli of the teeth and that no
greater space is present between the roots of the two incisors than between those of
the lateral incisor and canine. This fact, in conjunction with the proof that the
crowns of the lateral incisor and canines were in contact, shows that no diastema in
the proper sense of the term was present in this region, The presence and size
of the root canals are also revealed by the skiagrams, but there is nothing worthy
of note in this respect.
