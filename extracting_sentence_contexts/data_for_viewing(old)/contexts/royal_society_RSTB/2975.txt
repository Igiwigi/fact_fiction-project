admirable illustration in the series of three transverse sections from one seed
(W. 1915, M.; 1915, O.; 8. 236) represented in Plate 7, figs. 1, 2, and 3. This
series has a further interest in that the seed, although of full size, was still enclosed
in the remains of the cupule. The approximate positions of the three sections are
indicated in the diagram (text-fig. 1).


THE PALAOZOIC SEED, LAGENOSTOMA LOMAXI. 199

The lowest section (fig. 3) is across the chalazal region just below the plane in
which the main vascular bundle breaks into its nine radiating strands. The eccentric
position of the fibrous cushion which surrounds the vascular bundle arises from the
fact that the section is not truly at right angles to the axis of the seed, an explanation
holding good in the other two members of the series as well. The section across the
canopy (fig. 1) shows the nine loculiâ€”the radial septa becoming incomplete on that
side of the section which dips to a slightly lower level. Within the canopy, with
cusps corresponding to its folds, lies the wall of the pollen-chamber, and inside this,
like a little circular island, is the transversely cut central cone.

The outside wall of both these sections is very thick in comparison with its true
diameter (as shown by the middle section, fig. 2), owing to the nearly tangential plane
in which the wall has been cut. In both sections, but particularly in that across the
canopy (fig. 1), many series of palisade cells are cut through before the section has
done with this layer. And we note the further point that the palisade cells stand in
radial files, a result of the meridian-like lines in which the palisade cells are doubtless
