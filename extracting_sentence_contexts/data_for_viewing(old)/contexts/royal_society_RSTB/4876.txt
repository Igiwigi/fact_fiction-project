of a dry autumn, and my calculations fifteen years ago pointed to this period being
more important than the winter. It is not very clear from the writings of GILBERT
and Lawes how far they realised this feature of the wheat’s requirements ; it would
seem that they were aware of it, but they lay all stress upon the winter rainfall and
the washing of the nitrates out of the soil. Wheat is a deep-rooting plant, and I
believe it to be probable that, if experiments could be devised to test the point,
it would be found that the real effect of a very wet autumn is mechanical—that
it is then more the clogging of the soil that prevents the proper development of the
root system than the absence of sufficient nitrates. The effect of the loss of the
latter is probably more felt later on, during the winter, after the plant is established,
and this is reflected in the heavy negative coefficient with rain during the winter
months. Gi~Bert and Lawes have laid so much emphasis upon the washing out
of the nitrates that it is generally overlooked that they did in fact recognise the
hindrance to root development caused by saturated soil. It seems reasonable to
conclude from the data that the mechanical effect of the autumn is just as important
as the chemical effect of the winter; and it is, moreover, one that is practically
irremediable.”

The statement that the winter dip is slightly greater refers to the partial correlations
obtained after eliminating the effects of temperature ; we are here only concerned with the
total effects, and it is apparent that Hooker’s data contain substantial evidence for a
real deleterious effect of Autumn rainfall. In other respects the series of correlations is
not out of harmony with several of the Broadbalk plots, the characteristic period of
winter damage is clearly recognisable in both, and we may identify the positive corre-
lations obtained in late Spring with the minimum of damage observed on several of
