This reduction is thus seen to be double that originating from the capillary-pressure
for a water jet with a diameter of 1 mm. becomes /, = circa 3Â°0 cm.

This fact has also been the subject of but little attention, though A. Dupri* has
undertaken some interesting experiments about the height to which a jet can rise.

A closer examination of how the reduction of velocity corresponding to h, spreads
itself over the jet I am obliged to leave to another opportunity, only a particular
characteristic fact being named here. If the pressure is reduced more and more so
that it comes near to the value h,+h, the jet can be observed to deviate more and
more from a parabola, the curvature of the jet just outside the hole becoming much
too great. If the pressure is reduced almost to h,+h, the jet first runs a short
distance horizontally and then falls vertically down. If we determine the discharge
and cross-section of the jet, the velocity in the horizontal part of the jet can be
calculated, and it will be observed that this velocity is almost equal to that
corresponding to the pressure /,. It is very difficult to maintain the jet in the above
position ; the slightest disturbance will cause the jet to cease.

It is also possible to determine the velocity of a jet by measuring the pressure it
produces by 1formal impact on a sufficiently large plane surface. Measurements in
this manner have been made, for example, by Burr,t} who worked with a jet with
