If future conditions become wetter (x <1),
say due to increased mean rainfalls, the loss fraction decreases, and the runoff change is greater
than the precipitation change. Alternatively if future conditions become drier (x > 1), say due to
greater evaporation and less rainfall lowering soil moisture content, the percentage change in
runoff is less than the percentage change in precipitation. In fact, the percentage change in runoff
can be negative despite increases in extreme rainfall. These decreases in runoff are only exhibited
for relatively large (soil) drying changes. For example, a 35% loss with 20% (x = 1.2) increase in
drying (i.e 42% loss) will result in a negative runoff change for a 7% increase in precipitation.
