Tn these experiments, the divided wire was of German-silyer, each division being _
equal to 00021105 ohm at the temperature of the room, and since 100 ohms were
used at each end of the wire, the alteration of resistance represented by moving the
sliding-piece over one division of the wire would equal g57gghroz5 of the whole, the
effect of one-tenth of a division was readily perceptible, and the second place of
decimals in the above columns were got by taking the mean of several observations
at each pressure. From the above results it was calculated that the decrease of resis-
tance per unit produced by an increase of fluid-pressure of 1 grm. per square centimetre
would be 27854 x 10-Y,

On showing these results, however, to Professor G. G. STokes, he suggested that
sufficient account had not been taken of the fact that the alteration of pressure might
affect the resistance by altering the melting-point temperature of the ice, though, as
I thought, the ice would not be sufficiently wet in the inner cylinder, as the tempera-
ture of the room at the time was frequently almost at 0* C., and the cylinder well
gurrounded by ice on the outside to affect the resulb in this way. Nevertheless,
acting on this 8uggestion, I carefully determined the increase of resistance at 0* C.
@ for a rise of 1* C., in the manner adopted by MATTHIESSEN, and found this to be
0038587 per unit of resistance. Now, J. THoMsS0N was led by theoretical considera-
tions* to the conclusion that the melting-point temperature of water would be lowered
*0075* C. by an increase of one atmosphere of pressure, and the matter was put to
experimental test by W. THoms0N, who arrived at results agreeing almost exactly with
this conclusion, If we ass8ume one atmosphere to be equal to 76 centims. of mercury,
or 1034 grms, per square centimetre, the lowering of temperature produced by a
