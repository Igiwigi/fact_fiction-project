Further, at the junction between
ventral (limb) and dorsal ccelom two pairs of hollow diverticula grow out to form the
extrinsic muscles of the leg, namely flexors and extensors. The first thing to note there is the greater development of ccelomic cavity in the
generalised Orthopteron than in Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera (in the latter
case it is absent), EscuertcH, 1900; Noack, 1901, etc. The fact that insects have a hemo-
ceelic body cavity in the adult is foreshadowed by the reduction of embryonic ccelom. The retention of conspicuous coelomic cavities in embryos of Orthoptera must be regarded
as a vestigial feature. In comparing the differentiation of mesoderm in Carausius and
Pieris Wiesmannâ€™s Blutzellenlamelle corresponds exactly to what I have called median
mesoderm, both giving rise to transverse muscles and to blood cells.
