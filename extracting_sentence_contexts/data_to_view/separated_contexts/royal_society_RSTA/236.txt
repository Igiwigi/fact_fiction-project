When studying the oscillations for different values of h*, one may observe
that unstable solutions for h#? < h* < h+ are similar in shape to those shown in
figure 4d-f, but their minima decrease as h* approaches ht. For h7~ < h* < hÂ¥,
the unstable solutions look like the unstable solutions in figure 4d but upside-
down, and now the maxima increase as h* approaches h~. On the other hand,
one may find that the stable stop-and-go solution for h~ < h* < h* almost does
not change in state space compared with figure 4e,f, but the lengths of low- and
high-velocity plateaux change compared with figure 4d according to

(Here Tjam is measured at vp = VUmax/3.) In other words, h* and h7 are
independent of the equilibrium density h*, and, in fact, the fold bifurcations
happen in figure 4b when the low- and high-velocity plateaux disappear at h* ~ h*
and h* * h-, respectively. Phil. Trans.
