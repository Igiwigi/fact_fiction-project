'Thus we should have a quantity of tissue composed of modified nuclei and
wasted nerye-fibres which would accumulate as the muscle adyanced in growth, and
through which many of the nerye-fibres would be seen to pass. Many of these nuclei
and fibres having been originally continuous with the nerye-fibres would still retain
connexion with them, but this connexion is not necessarily a physiological one. Other explanations might be offered, but I desire now only to draw attention to the
fact that all nerye-fibres at their periphery are continuous with exceedingly delicate

fibres which have hitherto been regarded as belonging to connective tissue, but which
differ from yery fine yellow elastic fibres in their granular appearance, in their mode of
branching and the curves which they form, in refractive power, and in the alteration
resulting from the prolonged action of dilute acetic acid *. It seems quite poxsible'that complete neryous circuits may exist, and the delicate fibres
of the plexus may be connected with delicate fibres from the branches of nerve-fibres
ramifying in the connective tissue.
