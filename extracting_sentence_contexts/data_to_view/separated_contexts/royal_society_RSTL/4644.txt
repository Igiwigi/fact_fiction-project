Received December 18, 1850, â€”Read January 30, 1851. In a paper lately communicated to the Royal Society, I showed that the effect of
tartrate of ammonia on the acidity of the urine was totally different from that of
tartrate of potash ; and that carbonate of ammonia taken in very large quantities did
not produce any alkaline reaction of the urine; on the contrary, the acidity was
rather increased than diminished by large doses of carbonate of ammonia. I repeated
these experiments with carbonate of ammonia, hoping to obtain more decided results ;
but I could not determine the fact of any great increase in the acidity of the urine,
although it was again apparent that no diminution of the acid reaction resulted
from taking carbonate of ammonia. ;

I also repeated these experiments on many patients in St. George's Hospital
suffering from chronic rheumatism, but though some took on an average 50 grs. of
carbonate of ammonia daily for seven or more weeks,
