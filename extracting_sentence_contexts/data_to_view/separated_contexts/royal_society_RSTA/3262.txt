nanotechnology’.

1. Introduction 3
The potential of plant-derived nanoscale cellulosic materials such as cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) : a
has been successfully demonstrated in diverse applications, including responsive membranes [1], 3
bio-based nanocomposites [2] and diagnostics [3]. The exploitation of these biomaterial-based : XS
building blocks has gained high interest not only because of their status as green, lightweight : _
and renewable materials—although these are undoubtedly positive assets—but also due to the 4
fact that nanocellulosic materials possess several inherent features. These include, for example, : =
piezoelectric properties, low thermal conductivity, high thermal stability and low density coupled 3
with relatively high strength as well as the ability to form flexible films that can act as a gas barrier 1S

material [4-7]. Hybrid structures combining organic with inorganic materials are commonplace and many of
the applications, like solar cells, are based on thin-film technology [8].
