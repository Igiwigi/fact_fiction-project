avoid this contradictory situation, we assume the existence of a background constant vorticity 1B

The linear stability of a vortex crystal is verified by computing the eigenvalues to the linearized : s
matrix £¢ R2N*2N of (2.3) around the configuration of the vortex crystal numerically. Since : 3
equations (2.3) are written as a Hamiltonian dynamical system, the eigenvalues of the matrix £ io

become either a pair of real numbers with the opposite signs or a conjugate pair of pure imaginary
numbers.
