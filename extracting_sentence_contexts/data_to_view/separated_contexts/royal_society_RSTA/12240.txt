The value of the second part in (205), depending upon o, comes to

and its rate of decrease with respect to a expresses the repulsion between the pole
and the p, region. This gives (203) again. A fourth way is by means of the quasi-electromagnetic force on fictitious interfacial
electric current, instead of matter, the current being circular about the axis of
symmetry AB, The formula for the attraction is

Also the tangential component of Ry is mz/4mp,7°. Therefore the repulsion is
