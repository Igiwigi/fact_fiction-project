When the mud first arrived, the number of larvee that could be hatched from it was
considerable, and a large proportion of these grew to maturity. After a few months,
however, the yield of larvee was much smaller and a far smaller proportion survived to
maturity. There was certainly a diminution in the number that hatched, but the fact
that so few survived must be attributed, partly at least, to the fact that the crop of
micro-organisms hatching out with the nauplii became progressively smaller, and hence
the food supply became insufficient. It was attempted to make up this deficiency with
protozoal cultures reared in the laboratory, but without success. The micro-organisms
at first consisted of various flagellates and ciliates as well as bacteria, but subsequently
the bacteria only were evident and these in far fewer numbers.

The youngest stages were very easy to obtain, despite the fact that they were exceed-
ingly minute, as they always collected at the surface of the water at the side of the vessel
nearest the light. This may have indicated a positive phototropism in the larve, as has
been recorded in the case of other Phyllopoda. However, it must be borne in mind that
the larvae may have gathered in the region where the food was most plentiful, the photo-
tropism being exhibited by the food organisms rather than the larvee.

Various fixatives were used. At first cold saturated sublimate in distilled water was
used. Then it was found that strong Flemming gave quite good fixation. Finally
Flemming without acetic was used, and this gave excellent results. Since this fixative is
admittedly one of the best general cytological fixatives, it was used in all subsequent work.
It was allowed to act for about 14 hours only. Longer fixation gave no better results.
