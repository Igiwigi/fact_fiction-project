It is worth noting that the expression (5.4), describing the variation of PW, involves the
Cosserat modulus b3 (the secondary bending stiffness). However, this bending stiffness is not
involved in the infinite-body Green’s function, equation (4.27), which depends on the parameter
bo (with bp =b; — b3). In fact, although the relations for continuity of tractions (5.2) hold for
any value of the Cosserat modulus b3, it is apparent from (4.6)4 that, in order for (PD)® and
(E) to be lost simultaneously, the parameter b3 must be set to zero, b3 = 0, so that the emerging
discontinuity line becomes admissible (see also [5]). Additional insight into the circumstances just described is provided by figure 7, where (a)
the real part of the normalized jump gf and (b) the real part of the dimensionless out-of-plane
displacement are depicted along the folding line x=0 for a Cosserat material at the (EI/P)
boundary for loss of (E) with 6 =0, y =1/4, « =1/4 and 4 =1. It is observed that, when the
microinertia is null (dashed curve) or when 6 < 6* (red curves in figure 7a), the jump, according to
equation (5.4), is a real-valued exponentially decaying function of y.
