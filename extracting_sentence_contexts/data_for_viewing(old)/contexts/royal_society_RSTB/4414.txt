implement was the object at which the ancient workmen were aiming. They required
a good cutting edge for various purposes, and the curving keel of the rostro-carinate
gave them what they wanted. In a paper published recently,* the author has shown
that with the wish to provide a longer cutting edge the sharp keel was gradually
carried further and further back towards the posterior region of the implement, and

that this extension of the keel was accompanied, inevitably, by the reduction in size
of the dorsal platform. He also drew attention to the fact that from the Pre-Crag

period onwards the width of the ventral plane suffers a marked reduction. The Post-
Crag rostro-carinates, in fact, show an ever-increasing tendency to be compressed
from side to side. In the Middle Glacial Gravel of Suffolk, a deposit later in age
than the Red Crag, a series of rostro-carinates has been found which shows clearly
the characteristics above described. A diagrammatic drawing of one of these rostro-
carinate implements from the Middle Glacial Gravel is given in fig. 5, and it will be seen
