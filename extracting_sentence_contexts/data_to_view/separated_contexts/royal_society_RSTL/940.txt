While this paper was in the press, I have been so fortunate
as to receive from Sir THoMAas STAMFORD RAFFLES, another
skull belonging to a dugong, 8 feet long, in which the milk
tusks had been shed, and the permanent ones had acquired
sufficient length to show the degree they project beyond the
bony sockets, and the manner in which they are worn down,
by rooting up the plants while feeding. They are consider-
ably broader than the milk tusks, even at their points, ex-
plaining the use of the cup at the end of the milk tusk being
wider than the tusk itself, to admit of the point of the perma-
nent one having this encreased breadth. These tusks bear a near resemblance to those of the hog,
the points being turned a little outwards, and they wear down
in the same manner,

It is not a little remarkable, that in writing this paper upon
the milk tusks, I should have an opportunity, during an acci-
dental delay in the press, of being furnished with materials to
show the appearance of the permanent tusks, which forms s0
essential a character of the animal, and also to prove that
while young, there are incisors in the lower jaw; two of
them in the jaw of this skull having been accidentally en-
tangled (while shedding,) in the new bone that was closing

up the socket, and 'consequently retained there. | This is a
curious additional fact, and is 80 far an approach to rumi-
nating animals, whose incisors are only in the lower jaw. These incisors enable the young dugong to crop the tender
plants, but are no longer wanted when the animal grows up. EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES.
