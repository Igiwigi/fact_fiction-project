actual separations must be larger. Those in the table of F lines above are roughly
parallel to the BaF, and give a limit somewhere about 24520. VD,,(2) would
therefore be about this, and VD,,;(2) more than 692+4382 = 1124 larger. The
denominator of VD,;(2) should be a multiple of A,. Using the most probable value
of A, = 376,, it is found that the denominator comes out very close to a multiple of
314, If this be made exact it is found that VD,;(2) = F,(%) = 2575275. The
value of F,() is then taken 25752°75+€ The values of 3 are so large that there
can be no ambiguity about the multiples to be chosen to give the separations, viz.,
163, 103. These multiples march well with those for Ca, Sr, Ba. The separations
resulting are 705°93, 456°69, with F, (0) = 24590°13 and F,(o) = 2529606. If we
apply the rule shown in the preceding elements for F,;,(2), the denominator is
2°937300—2A, = 2°868676. Satellites depending on 30, 2d would give separations
51°44 and 34°20, and the fact that these separations occur in connection with
n = 17800 renders the identification of that for F (3) rather doubtful, a doubt which
is increased when we test the allocation by the law indicated above that the

differences of the denominators of F,,(m)—F,,(m+1) is always the same multiple of
A,, as is done below. The line 19897 has separation 689°33, and therefore should
have a satellite (too faint) 16°60 above it. Allowing for observational errors on
19897 this is 53 on the denominator. The following scheme will then illustrate the
law of formation :—
