River coming down on fire.” Mr. Ropertson turned and saw a raging flood of hot
water tearing down the valley. He estimated its height at 30 to 40 feet, and states
that he never had seen so high a flood in the river before. There had been no rain
that morning at Wallibu, or, so far as he knew, on the leeward side of the mountain,
to account for this, and he concluded, naturally, that it was the boiling water of the
erater lake pouring down the stream.

No doubt similar torrents coursed down the other streams on this side of the
island, as the Wallibu Dry River, the Rozeau Dry River, and perhaps also the
Larikai. On the windward side a little after 12 o'clock the Rabaka River came
down in floods of boiling water.*

In the light of these facts, Mr. McDonaxp’s subsequent notes may be readily
interpreted.

“12.35. It seemed as if slope to left of old road up Soufriére had formed into
fissure, as vapour was issuing from small vents, and at 12.40 these fissures were
unmistakable, and discharges from crater were extended to windward.

“12.50. Enormous outburst through vent or front of mountain as far as could
be ascertained, the mountain being largely enveloped in vapour, &c.”

This last was probably the greatest discharge, and practically completed the
emptying of the lake, but again at 1.25 and 1.33 p.m. he mentions volumes of vapour
arising from the slopes of the hill. What was happening in the Wallibu and other
