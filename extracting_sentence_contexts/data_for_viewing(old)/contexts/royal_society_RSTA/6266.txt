5Here, I deliberately use the descriptor ‘non-Bayesiar’ rather than ‘frequentist’ and do not consider them synonymous. For
example, both maximum-likelihood estimation and penalized approaches like the lasso are non-Bayesian, but, in contrast
to confidence intervals and p-values, not inherently frequentist. Of course, one may study the frequency properties of these
procedures, but one may also study the frequency properties of Bayesian methods.


(a) Population structure and clustering

The first example is my work on so-called ‘admixture models’ to infer population structure
from genetic data [32]. In brief, population structure refers to the fact that some individuals
are more genetically similar than others. Thus, a typical first attempt to investigate population
structure might involve applying some kind of clustering method to the genetic data. The main
contribution of [32] was to extend a standard model-based cluster model to allow that each
individual could have partial membership in each cluster; that is, in the language of population
genetics, to allow that individuals may be ‘admixed’. In essence, we did this by replacing the
usual ‘latent variable’ formulation of clustering, in which each individual i is assumed to belong
to some latent cluster z; € {1,...,K}, with an assumption that each individual has a latent vector
9i = (Git, ---,9ik), Where qi denotes the proportion of membership of individual i in cluster k.
In the genetic context, the clusters can be interpreted as ‘ancestral populations’ and qj is the
proportion of individual i’s genome that was inherited from ancestral population k.

We tackled this problem in a Bayesian way, by specifying prior distributions on the [2
