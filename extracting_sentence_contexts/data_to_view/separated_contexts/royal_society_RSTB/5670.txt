In the four experiments of this group, as
in most of those of the first group, only a small part, less than half, of the presumptive
stipular area of I, next to P, was left on the apex, so that there was no available gap
between P, and the wound in which the central part of I,/ could arise. The centre of
this primordium arose above the centre of the wound and can hardly be said to occupy
a gap at all. The fact that results like those of the second and third groups, in which the next
primordium after the isolated primordium arose obliquely or directly above the wound,
were obtained only after the isolations of I,, and never after those of I,, is probably to be
explained as follows. Reasons were given in section (8) for considering that the increase
in the space available above the wound, relative to the amount of space available on the
other side of the apex, which was due to the shift of the growing-point, was greater after
isolation of I, than of P,. For the same reasons it was probably greater still after
isolation of I,, so that, in the isolations of I, of the second and third groups, a position
obliquely or directly above the wound was the lowest available position for the next
primordium.
