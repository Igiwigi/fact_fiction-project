Two changes seemed to be particularly noticeable: that undergone by yellow,
which becomes white or pale grey; and that undergone by violet, which becomes neutral tint. When colour filters and coloured cardboard were tested, it was found that the colour changes
which they suffered, owing to reduction of visual angle, were substantially the same as
those for monochromatic colours given above (in table 17). This fact, coupled with the
knowledge that, as mentioned above, the fringes produced by chromatic aberration are not
themselves composed of monochromatic rays, justified their use in these experiments. 540 H. HARTRIDGE ON THE

It should be emphasized that there is nothing critical with regard to these experiments. The size of the pupil, the intensity of illumination of the test object, and its depth of tint,
as will be shown in the sections which follow, all affect the visual angle at which full colour
vision is replaced by reduced colour vision, and vice versa (see ยง 22).
