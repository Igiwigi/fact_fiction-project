of calorific comfort foods, further increasing body weight [44].
Another is increased psychological distress. A meta-analysis of
105 cross-sectional studies with multiple mental health out-
comes showed associations between perceived weight stigma
and greater depression, anxiety, psychological distress and
poor quality of life [45], all of the reviewed studies were
cross-sectional so longitudinal relationships could not be
established, and although psychological outcomes were
worse for people of higher body weight, there were no associ-
ations with sex or age. Research on weight stigma and
psychological distress has focused on the perceptions of vic-
tims rather than on objective indicators of discrimination.
This is not surprising because the fact that an observer regards
certain situations as discriminatory does not mean that the
individual appraises these situations in the same way, and
many people with high body weight learn to cope effectively
[46]. How important weight stigma is to weight maintenance
and weight gain is difficult to gauge; it is notable that studies
of weight stigma almost always taken BMI into account, but
that studies of mechanisms related to weight gain rarely
control for weight stigma.
