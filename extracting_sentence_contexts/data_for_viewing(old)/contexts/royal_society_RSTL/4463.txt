and vital force are © correlated,” —seems to be the expression of their mutual depend-
ence, which is most in accordance with all our knowledge of the influence of heat
upon organized beings; whilst conversely (as will be shown hereafter) it accords
with the fact of the restoration to the inorganic world—under some form or other—
of all the force thus withdrawn from it.

It may serve, however, to bring this idea into contrast with the notions usually
entertained, and to illustrate its application more fully, if it be considered in its re-
lation to the Development of any highly organized being from its primordial germ-
cell. According to the doctrine current among some physiologists, the whole * or-
ganizing force,” © nisus formativus,” or © bildungstrieb,” which is to be exerted in
the development of the complete structure, lies dormant in this single cell, the germ
(it has been affirmed) being © potentially” the entire organism. And thus all the or-
ganizing force required to build up an oak or a palm, an elephant or a whale, is
concentrated in a minute particle only discernible by microscopic aid.
