oocyte, the X chromosome derived from the nongrowing
oocyte undergoes inactivation in the extraembryonic tissues.
This clearly demonstrates that the imprint laid on the maternal
X is acquired during oocyte growth.

It would be reasonable to assume that this imprint prevents
upregulation of maternal Xist in the extraembryonic tissues.
Given the fact that the strict repression of maternal Xist is abol-
ished if Tsix is disrupted on the maternal X [22,24], it seems
likely that the maternal expression of Tsix is responsible for pre-
venting upregulation of Xist on the maternal X, and thereby
mediates the maternal imprint against X inactivation. Those
who disagree this idea would point out the fact that Tsix
expression has not yet been initiated when only the paternal
Xist becomes preferentially upregulated at the 4- to 8-cell
stages [24], and would therefore claim that Tsix would have
nothing to do with the imprint preventing Xist upregulation
on the maternal X at these stages. A possible difference in the
chromatin structure between the maternal and paternal Xist
locus may, however, account for the monoallelic upregulation
of Xist only on the paternal X at these stages. Since the sperm
genome undergoes global exchange from protamine to histone
and becomes decondensed in the zygote, there would be some
differences in the chromatin structure, and therefore in the
accessibility of transcription machinery, between the maternal
