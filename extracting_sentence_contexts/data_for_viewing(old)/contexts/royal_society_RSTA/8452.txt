sections perpendicular to the major axis have been calculated (see §21), and also the
distribution of resultant lateral pressure per foot run ($22). From the former we can
calculate by integration the “ form resistance,” from the latter the lateral force and
yawing moment due to normal pressures. For comparison with these results obtained
by integration, the actual drag, lateral force, and yawing moments were measured on
the aerodynamic balance. The drag at zero yaw was determined with the model
supported on wires ; for measuring the other quantities the model was supported on a
spindle, the necessary corrections being applied for the effect of the spindle.

15. As in the previous case, a length of composition tubing was inserted in the spheroid,
but in view of the fact that in these experiments the model was moving relative to the
earth, a special seal had to be constructed to transmit the pressures to the manometer.

NORMAL PRESSURES ON A PROLATE SPHEROID. 241

The model was supported, with the major axis horizontal, in a strong graduated band
(A) (fig. 2), made in two pieces, and such that by slackening two screws the model could
be rotated about the major axis, so that the angle between the plane containing the tube
