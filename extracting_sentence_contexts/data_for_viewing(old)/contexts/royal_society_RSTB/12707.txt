we calculate the number of individuals with phenotypic
value ¢* in the next generation as the sum of contributions
of each individual in the current population to ¢*. Certain
transforms, including the Laplace transform (used in equation
(5.1)) and the Fourier transform (used in equation (5.2)),
greatly facilitate calculation of convolutions. Specifically, the
Convolution Theorem [23] states that, for these transforms,
the transform of the convolution of two distributions is
simply the product of the transforms of the distributions.

As to why we choose the particular transforms used here:
we can always capture the frequency distribution in a popu-
lation with equation (5.1) because the fact that populations
and phenotypes are finite (axioms 1 and 3) insures that all
moments exist, along with the moment generating function
(mgf). When we are considering all possible future popu-
lations, however, it is not clear that the mgf will be defined
(for example, it is not defined for the log-normal distri-
bution). This is why we use the characteristic function in
equation (5.2), since it is defined even when the megf is not.
