This experiment, therefore, proved that the rhythmic movements can only have been due
to a stimulus emanating from the seat of injury, and continuously spreading over all the
other parts of the excitable surface of the bell. And, snch being the case, we can have
no farther doubt that the case of artificial rhythm due to previous electrical stimulation
belongs to the same category of physiological facts as the case of artificial rhythm due
to present or previous chemical stimulation. For now, in conclusion, I may observe that
in order to render the experimental parallel complete, T imitated in the case of chemical
stimulation the proof of the fact which I have just narrated in the case of electrical
stimulation, viz. : that the artificial rhythm depends on the continuous reception by the
excitable tissues of a stimulus which is continuously supplied from a seat, or seats, of
injury. The method which T employed to prove this fact in the case of chemical
stimulation was as follows. Having slit open the paralyzed bell of Sarsia along the
whole of one side from base to apex of the cone, I suspended the now sheet-like mass
of tissue by one corner in the air, leaving the rest of the sheet to hang vertically
downwards.
