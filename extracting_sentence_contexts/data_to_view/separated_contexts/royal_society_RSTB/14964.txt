While some exceptional
species like Hynobius dunni (see electronic supplementary
material, table S1) seem to swallow their prey unprocessed
as do most frogs [164,165], the observations presented here
suggest that intraoral food processing is a basal caudate
trait (table 1 and electronic supplementary material, table S1). Below we provide an overview of how intraoral food proces-

developmental morphotypes. Tongue—palate rasping be explained by the fact that the beginning of the kinematic | 10 |
