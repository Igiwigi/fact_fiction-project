minutes in a cup of water, communicate this smell, anda pecu-
lar taste, to the water. The taste is probably derived from an
impalpable powder, which floats in the water for many days.

Derbyshire black marble, and the stinking blue fluor, give
out, on attrition, a strong smell peculiar to themselves, both
in air and water ; they lose this property by being once made
red hot.

Quartz produces the smell equally strong in fixed, pure, and
common, air.

Having now stated all the facts relative to phosphorescent
bodies which I have as yet been able to discoyer, I shall beg
leave to offer a few refz=ctions, tending to shew, that heat is the
probable cause of the light produced from bodies by attrition.

The powders of all earthy bodies emit light when heated a
little under redness. Now, when two bodies are rubbed upon
each other, it is probable that heat is always generated on
their surfaces : may not then the light which they yield upon
attrition be attributed to a sudden heating of particles in their
surfaces? for these particles will be affected in the same way
as if they had been equally heated by any other means ; they
will therefore give the same light as if they had been laid upon
