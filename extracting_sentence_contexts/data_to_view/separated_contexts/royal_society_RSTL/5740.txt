Still it formed its usual stratum at about
4000 to 5000 feet high, but its long rolls of cumuloni were broken up into separate and
distinct cumuli ; and on the south side of both Teneriffe and Grand Canary we could see
sImilar bodies of clouds advancing from the S.W., climbing the steep sides of the island,
and contesting the possession of the ridges day after day with the N.E. clouds. This
remarkable atrial combat, was carried on under our eyes with various success until Sep»
tember 11th, when the S.W. cloud obtained a preponderance, with a sinking barometer. The next day the S.W. cloud was decidedly the victor, while the N.E. cloud, simply to
describe the actual facts, was retiring before it in broken and disorganized masses. The
following day the barometer rose from 20-363 to 20-410, and the succeeding mornings
the 14th, to 20-473; at this time, however, were perceived on the sea, between 'Teneriffe
and Grand Canary, extraordinary appearances of some unusual and grand current from
the S.W., for there were long curyed lines traceable for fifty or more miles in their
length, indicating a stream setting in between 'Teneriffe and Canary. The sky s00n after
became cloudy above our heads; at 1 y.x. a sudden and heavy shower of rain and hail
came down; at 5 P.M. the cloud descended upon Alta Vista; and at 7 P.M. heavy rain
began with a violent wind from the S., producing more than 2 inches of rain in a gauge
before the next morning.
