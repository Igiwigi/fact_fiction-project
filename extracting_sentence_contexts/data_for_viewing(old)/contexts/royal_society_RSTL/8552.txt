stem consists of a number of well-marked internodes of various sizes. 'These are marked
by numerous faintly defined parallel longitudinal grooves, with others of a much more
sharply defined character at irregular intervals. The latter have obyiously been cracks
in the original bark, into which the matrix has entered, causing the latter to stand
out in projecting ridges. In this specimen the large cicatrices are planted in a verticil-
late manner upon each third node; in another and otheryise similar specimen in the
Owens College collection they are only planted upon eyery eighth node, thus exhibiting
variations in this plant which may possibly have been specific ones. The latter specimen
further indicates what is but obscurely shown in the example figured, viz. that the
cicatrices appear as if planted upon the node, and not above or below it.

The general resemblance of these large stems to Plate VII. fig. 44 is very striking.
The facts now stated, combined with the difficulty of collocating these examples with
any other known plant, strongly incline me to the belief that they are the arborescent
stems of the Asterophyllites with which they are associated in the specimen figured.

In August 1869 I published in the © Monthly Microscopic Journal * the brief memoir
referred to in No. IV.* of the present series, in which I separated two very distinct groups
of plants which had hitherto been regarded as allied to each other, viz. those belonging
to ExpricneR's genus Dadoxzylon, whose wood-cells were truly discigerous, and those
in which this character was only apparent, not real, it being due to a mere modification of
fibro-vascular tissue. In that memoir I said:—* It appears necessary, therefore, to esta-
blish a new genus for all the plants whose woody tissues consist of reticulated fibres,
and the name of Dictyozylon appears an appropriate one for it. I should propose, for
the present, to include in this genus all the reticulated types. At some future time
