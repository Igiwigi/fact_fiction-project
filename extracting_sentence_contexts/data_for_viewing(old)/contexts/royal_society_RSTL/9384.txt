It would, of course, have been much more interesting if it had been possible to
represent more exactly the mechanical properties of solid matter. One of the most
important of these is thab form of resistance to relative displacement, to which the
term © plasticity ” has been specially appropriated. This form of resistance is such that,
there is a change in the law of resistance to the relative motion of the parts, when the
forces tending to cause flow have reached a certain definite intensity. This idea was
founded, I believe, by MM. TrrscA and ST. VixaxT on a long course of experiments
on the punching and squeezing of metals ;* and they speak of a solid being reduced to
the state of fluidity by stresses of a given magnibude. This theory introduces a
discontinuity, since ib has to be determined what parts of the body are reduced to the
state of fluidity and what are not. But apart from this difficulty, there is another
one which is almost insuperable, in the fact that the differential equations of flow are
non-linear.

The hope of introducing this form of resistance must be abandoned, and the investi-
gation musb be confined to the inclusion of those two other continuous laws of resistance
to relative displacement—elasticity and viscosity.

As above stated, the law of elastico-viscosity assumed in this paper has nob got an
experimental foundation. Indeed, Konrravscn's experiments on glass* show that
the elasticity degrades rapidly at first, and that it tends to attain a final condition,
from which ib does not seem to vary for an almost indefinite time. But glass is one
of the most perfectly elastic substances known, and, by the light of Tresca's experi-
ments, it seems probable that experiments with lead would have bronght out very
