Remark. From the discussion above, it follows that when studying point vortex dynamics on
an ellipsoid the area form is different from that of the sphere and therefore the canonical variables
cannot be those of the sphere, as suggested by some authors. In fact for the ellipsoid of revolution
with p(@) =siné@ and (0) =bcos8, then

x=sin@cosg and y=sin@sing, z=bcos6,
and consequently the corresponding area form is

dopnipsoid = y 1 + (b? — 1) sin? 6 d(cos 8) A dg. It follows that canonical variables for the ellipsoid of revolution (for b 4 1) are

q=9 and p=[ Vise —1)sin? 6 d(cos 6),

which are quite different from those of the sphere, as inferred by some authors.

3. The equations of motion for S?

(a) Numerical integration & IR? formalism

For numerical integrations to avoid any ambiguity with spherical coordinates near the poles, it is
convenient to view the sphere S* as embedded in R°.
