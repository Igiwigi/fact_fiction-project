There was,
however, on all three plots, a considerable reduction in produce during the second 8ix
as compared with the first six years after the cessation of the application of the dung
on plots 2 and 1, Over the last five years, however, there was a slight excess of
produce compared with that over the previous six, even reckoning the first crops
only, and, including the second crops, there was a very considerably greater total pro-
duce, both on the unmanured and on the manured plots, than over the preceding six
years; and over the whole period of 25 years, there was nearly as much annual excess
on the manured plots compared with the unmanured, as over the first 20 years. Much the same may be aid of both the total mineral matter and the nitrogen taken
up. Indeed, much more of the mineral matter has been annually removed in the first
crops only, over the last five years, than over the preceding six, and including the
second Crops, very much more ; in fact, annually more than over the first 20 years. of
nitrogen there was, including the firs} and second crops, more than one-third more
annually taken off without manure, more on plot 2 with dung or its residue alone, and
one-third more on plot 1 with the ammonia-salts in addition, over the last five, than
over the preceding 20 years. Tt is obvious, therefore, that the removal of the second
crops in the later years is, as before said, rapidly accelerating exhaustion, a fact which
