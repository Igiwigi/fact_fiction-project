On defining r:=(y — yo) x bt + A*pt and p:=(y— Yo) x t+ v x 1, the integral equation (6.2)
writes obviously as

| rax+ | pdH? =0.

Since yo is arbitrary, once we choose y, we can select yg such that the above boundedness
assumption about |b+| over B may imply the one of (y — yo) x bt. Moreover, the above assumption
of the boundedness |.A*pt| over B implies the one of r. The assumed boundedness of the first
integral implies the one of the absolute value of the right-hand side term, so that we can apply
the standard procedure adopted for the traction t [12], obtaining a non-standard action-reaction
principle (6.4). We find, in fact,

p(x,n) = —p(x, —n),

ie. :3
(y — yo) x (t(x, 1) — t(x, —n)) + A*(t(x,) — t(x,—n)) =0, : =

so that from (6.3) we find (6.4). 12
Not writing explicitly time for the sake of conciseness, we can use a tetrahedron type argument nee)

to show the linearity of p with respect to n, namely we show the existence of a second-rank tensor eae
A(x) such that a]
p(x,n) =A(x)n(x). a
