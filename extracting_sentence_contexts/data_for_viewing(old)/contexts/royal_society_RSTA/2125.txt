In the phase reduction, the unperturbed system is given by a single limit-cycle oscillator : a
running along or near the closed orbit. There the phase of the oscillatory motion represents a : =
neutrally stable degree of freedom. Similarly to the oscillator near the Hopf bifurcation, weak : =
coupling force from the other oscillators and weak external drive, if necessary, are treated as [3
perturbation. : =

The fact that the unperturbed system contains a neutral mode implies that its solution as 8
t— oo includes at least one arbitrary parameter. For instance, the solution of the linearized if
system at the Hopf bifurcation as t > oo is given by a harmonic oscillation z = iwz, where the : s
complex amplitude z may be multiplied by an arbitrary complex number. For a limit-cycle motion : §
along the closed orbit, the phase ¢ changes as ¢ = or ¢ = wt + , where the initial phase yp is : S

arbitrary.

The most basic idea of reduction is to reinterpret such an arbitrary constant as a dynamical
variable, and absorb the effect of perturbation into this variable thereby causing its slow
evolution. At the same time, the unperturbed form of the solution must inevitably be changed,
but only a little. This small change modifies the dynamics of the slow variable, which in turn
produces an even smaller correction of the solution form. Such processes of mutual correction
