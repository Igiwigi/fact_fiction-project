Third, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying the influence of
neighbouring 15-min contracts on the price dynamics of a given contract. This is motivated by
the fact that adjacent contracts are driven by similar market information.

This paper is organized as follows: in ยง2, we lay out our dataset and perform an empirical
analysis of intraday transaction data of 15-min contracts. In ยง3, we present our econometric model


as well as the threshold regression. In ยง4, we calibrate our econometric model to market data and
discuss the estimation results. We offer our conclusions in ยง5.

2. Stylized facts

In this section, we lay out our dataset and empirically analyse transaction prices and trading
volumes of 15-min contracts.

(a) Data

We investigate high-frequency trade and linked fundamental data of all 96 15-min contracts
traded on the German continuous intraday power market at EPEX SPOT SE. Our observation
period spans from 1 January to 31 December 2015. The trade data of 15-min contracts involve
transaction prices and trading volumes from the continuous intraday trading session with a
1-min time resolution and are provided by [10]. This, however, does not imply that we observe
one transaction every minute, but it may take a multiple of one minute until the subsequent
