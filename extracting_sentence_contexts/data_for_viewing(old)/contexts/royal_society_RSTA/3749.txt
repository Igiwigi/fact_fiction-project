the barrier reflects the entropy penalty that CH3 pays for forming covalent bonds at the diamond
surface. Table 5 gives AG,(T), the free energy of activation for CH3 dissociation at the diamond
surface, calculated as the difference between the free energy at the variational transition state
and the free energy minimum near the C-C equilibrium bond distance. Table 5 also shows
the calculated thermal dissociation rate coefficients calculated using the Eyring equation, where
k(T) = (kgT/h) exp(—AG,(T)/RT). Figure 6 shows an Arrhenius plot of k(T) plotted against 1/T.
In a recent kinetic Monte Carlo modelling study of diamond growth under CVD
conditions [37], it was found that good agreement with observed rates of growth could be found
when assuming a rate constant for etching provided with an Eyring expression together with a
temperature-independent free energy of activation of 200 kJ mol™! (48 kcal mol~1). While this is


larger than the values shown in table 5, it should be noted that this value in fact corresponds
to the activation free energy for loss of an adsorbed ‘carbon’, which is typically present as a
—CH) group inserted into a surface C-C bond. In the presence of excess H atoms in the diamond
growth plasma, this can convert to a surface —CH3 group, but this process is endothermic by
approximately 80 kJ mol~! (19 kcalmol~) [20]. This suggests a free energy barrier for breaking
the surface —CH3 bond of about 29 kcal mol~!, which is in satisfactory agreement with the BXD
results in table 5, considering the uncertainty in the experimental analysis of the etching rate, and
the inaccuracies of our EVB potential.

5. Master equation model of non-equilibrium dissociation

The results discussed above provide significant microscopic insight into the relative time scales of
prompt (non-equilibrium) dissociation of CH3 at the diamond surface, and thermal (equilibrium)
