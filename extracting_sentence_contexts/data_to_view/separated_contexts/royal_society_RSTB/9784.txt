In addition, SIgA is endowed with anti-
inflammatory properties [5]. Relatively small amounts of IgG
are synthesized in the gastrointestinal tract of healthy individ-
uals, but higher levels are observed in subjects with acute and
chronic (inflammatory bowel diseases; coeliac disease) inflam-
matory conditions mainly through transudation from blood
[4,6]. Given the fact that IgG and complement are sensitive to
proteolytic degradation in the gut milieu, the protective role
of intestinal IgG appears to be limited. Secretory IgM is also
found in intestinal secretions at concentrations relatively

. ar . A lower than SIgA, but its concentration is increased in a large
