Form of cells. â€”TIt has been stated in a former memoir* that a great irregularity
in marginal conformation is quite peculiar to these cells in Man. Now we can by no
means state that snch is the case with the corresponding elements in the Pig ; in fact,
a striking uniformity in the contour of these cells is observable, by far the greater
proportion taking the form of an elongate pyramid, the few exceptions occurring being
usually gigantic spindles. They resemble closely, both in size and form, the large
pyramidal cells at the deepest portion of the third layer in Bimana, Quadrumana, and
the large Carnivora, as also the ganglion cells in the parietal and tempero-sphenoidal
lobes of Man. Nowhere do we find the irregular, swollen, and at times almost
globose cells 80 frequent in the motor area of the human brain.
