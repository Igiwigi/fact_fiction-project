(b) For the important case of Markovian Co-semigroups on L!-spaces, Theorem 3.8, and
various versions thereof, turn out to be extremely useful in mathematical biology. See
for instance the recent papers [34,35] and the plenty of references therein.

(c) A related version of Theorem 3.8 in [23, Theorem 3.5] is instrumental to prove
convergence results for so-called transition semigroups on spaces of measures, which
occur frequently in stochastic analysis and in PDE theory and which are in many cases
not Cp. For details, we refer to the recent preprint [44].

5. Semigroups associated with forms, and criteria for asymptotic compactness

An important class of semigroups are those associated with a bilinear form. In fact, many classical
parabolic problems are governed by forms. Let H be a Hilbert space over the real field.

Definition 5.1 (Closed forms). A closed form on H is a pair (a, V) with the following properties:

d
(a) V is a Hilbert space that is densely and continuously embedded in H (for short: V > H).
(b) a: V x V>R is a bilinear form which is continuous (i.e. |a(u,v)| <M |lully |lully for all
u,v € V and a fixed constant M > 0) and elliptic, i.e. there exist w > 0 and a > 0 such that

a(u,u) + llull?, >a lull, — forallue V. (5.1)

Let (a, V) be a closed form on H. Since V is dense in H there exists a unique operator A on
