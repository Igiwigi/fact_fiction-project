quadrigeminum (figs. 6, 7). They penetrate the corpus, many of the fibres probably
terminating here ; others, however, remain or become superficial in the hinder portion
of the superior corpus, and cross over to the opposite side in the roof of the aqueduct
of Sylvius as the large medullated fibres described above. The fibres are not traceable
below the inferior corpus, and they appear to remain confined to the quadrigeminal

bodies.


THE PYRAMIDAL SYSTEM IN THE MESENCEPHALON AND BULB. 219

There is not yet sufficient evidence to say whether these fibres are of cortical
origin, but appearances would favour the view. The fact remains, however, that a
descending tract of fibres leaves the internal capsule, traverses the thalamus, and is
distributed to the quadrigeminal region of the opposite, and probably of the same,
side. The reason for supposing the fibres to be of cortical origin will appear more
clearly in the next section, where it: will be shown that fibres leave the pes pedunculi
and pass backwards to the quadrigeminal region.

Section through mesencephalon above the level of the [11rd nerve, to show fibres derived from internal
capsule and pyramid.
