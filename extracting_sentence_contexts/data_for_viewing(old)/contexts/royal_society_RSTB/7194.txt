2 L, E. R. PICKEN ON SHAPE AND MOLECULAR

The biologist cannot but be impressed by this fundamental similarity in structure of
materials as diverse as muscle, hair and the bast of Boehmeria. Moreover, these three have
that in common which separates them from many other natural fibres—from the fibres of
elastoidin, collagen and elastin, for example: they are each composed of specialized cells.
In each case the embryonic or undifferentiated cells from which the tissue is derived are
more or less isometric; in each case differentiation results in the formation of a long, spindle-
shaped or cylindrical cell. The fact that in all these instances elongation of the cell body
takes place in that direction in which the long axis of the molecules is oriented, or comes to be
oriented, or in a direction related to this, has hitherto received little attention. The regularity
suggests that there may be some general principle of anisometric cell growth underlying
such behaviour, and it was with this in mind that other types of elongated cell have been
examined.

The diversity of the examples quoted here is impressive. But it would be premature to
suppose that anisometric growth in cells is invariably, though frequently, correlated with
molecular orientation. The outer segment of the rods and cones of the retina, of whose
structure Schmidt (1938) has made so fascinating an analysis, provide an exception, at
least in their fully developed condition. Here, however, we know nothing of the develop-
ment of the cell itself, and Schmidt’s analysis is confined to the outer segment.
