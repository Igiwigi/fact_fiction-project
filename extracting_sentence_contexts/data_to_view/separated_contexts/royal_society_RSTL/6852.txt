The third paper* of the series to which I have referred was devoted to the exami-
nation of one particular vapour, which on account of its universal diffusion possesses
an interest of its own—L mean of course the vapour of water. In this paper I con-
sidered all the objections which had been urged against my results up to the time when
the paper was written ; I replied to each of them by definite experiments, removing
them one by one, and finally placing, as I believe, beyond the pale of reasonable doubt
the action of the aqueous vapour of our atmosphere. In this third paper, moreover,
the facts established by experiment are applied to the explanation of various atmo-
spheric phenomena, *

I have now the honour to lay before the Royal Society a fourth memoir, containing
an account of further researches. Hitherto 1 have confined myself to experiments on
radiation through gases and yapours which were introduced in succession into the same
experimental tube, the heat being thus permitted to pass through the same thickness of
different gases. A portion of the present inquiry is devoted to the examination of the
transmission of radiant heat through different thicknesses of the same gaseous body.
