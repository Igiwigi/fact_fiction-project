Against this background, seeing the quest for scientific knowledge as a journey
guided by organized scepticism, how do we give scientific advice for policy
making? How do we make sound choices in ways that engender public confidence?

The recipe for arriving at scientific consensus on a given issue—climate
change; the evolutionary origin of species; safety of the MMR vaccine; GM
foods; you name it—is relatively easily stated. Bring together the appropriate
experts, consulting widely and deliberately seeking and considering dissenting
opinions. Identify conflicts of interest, but do not necessarily use them as grounds
to exclude individuals. And, above all, do all this openly. In many practical
circumstances it is most important, yet most difficult, to separate the scientific
facts and uncertainties—which must serve as a constraining background—from
policy choices. In addition, one should aim to assess the magnitude of risks,
whenever possible, and to manage them proportionately. When real or perceived
uncertainties remain, give people choices whenever possible (e.g. label GM food).

This relatively simple list of precepts was set out in the Protocols for Science
Advice in Policy Making issued by John Major’s Government in 1996. They have
subsequently been reviewed and reaffirmed by Tony Blair’s Government in 1997
and 2000 and by Gordon Brown’s Government in 2006 (at each iteration they
have grown bulkier, but their essentials remain unchanged). Independent support
for such rules also has been provided (with acknowledgement of the originating
1996 document) by the Phillips Inquiry into BSE in 2000 and the House of Lords
Science & Technology Select Committee in 2000 (the Jenkins Report).
