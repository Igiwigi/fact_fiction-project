V. Analysis of the Natural Yellow Pigment. Having regard to the fact that the substance is an amorphous one, its purity being
therefore difficult to demonstrate, the following analyses are given with all due reserve. But it will be seen that substantial agreement is obtained in the figures yielded by
pigment from entirely different species, and even from different genera, a fact which
should certainly add to their value. A sufficient number of a given species of insect
to yield pigment for quantitative work is seldom to be obtained on any one occasion. The analyses were therefore made at long intervals during a period of more than three
years, the combustion apparatus used varying in different experiments.
