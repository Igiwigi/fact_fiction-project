academics thinking about mitigating climate change as the urge to present better and clearer
information is inherent to research training. Smith’s paper therefore establishes a crucial
opportunity for researchers relevant not just to television but to all media storytelling. It is hard
to win long-form television coverage for most complex issues, but the multiplication of platforms
and increasing influence of social media allows the demand reduction research community to
pursue a strategy of experimentation with storylines and storytellers. Sufficient investment of
time and imagination will ensure that some will reach or influence the still-dominant mass
medium of television, and sharing these via social and other media platforms is in any case
a ‘no regrets’ route to increased public attention. Reducing demand for energy and materials
is a fundamental necessity to mitigating climate change but only very rarely achieves public
prominence, so is currently unlikely to motivate significant interest from ministers. In order to
