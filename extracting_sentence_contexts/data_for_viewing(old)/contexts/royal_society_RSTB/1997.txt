growth results in the aposporous development of a prothallus. It is more difficult,
however, to see in which manner apogamy can be dependent on a nuclear change.
The sharp contrast between the sporophytic tissue and that of the prothallus, which
has been mentioned several times in the preceding pages, is in favour of some such
change occurring. The result may possibly be associated with a nuclear fusion, and
it has been shown that not infrequently two nuclei occur in the cells of Scolopendrium
near the boundary line between sporophytic and gametophytic tissue. But it may
be pointed out that, whatever the change may be, it can occur independently of the
sexual fusion, which occurs in fertilisation. This implies a modification of any view
of the necessary association of the origin of the second generation with the result
of fertilisation. The correlation of the double number of chromosomes with the

_ sporophyte might, in the light of the facts of induced apogamy, be regarded as due

to a subsequent association, and not as the fundamental fact in the origin of the
neutral generation. All speculation on these points must, however, be tentative until
the actual condition of matters in apogamy and apospory has been ascertained.

Conclusion.

Tn this paper the possible value of the study of apogamy in Ferns as one of the
lines of evidence which bear on the nature of alternation in archegoniate plants has
been considered. This has been done on the basis of results obtained from a series of
