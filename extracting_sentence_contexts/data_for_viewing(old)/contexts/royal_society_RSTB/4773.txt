course of the membrana elastica externa, four portions that occur in sheath-cartilage,
while the other four are calcified parts of the arch-cartilages.

Again, in Mustelus it can be shown that, whereas the diagonal calcified lamelle
are usually in sheath-cartilage entirely, it sometimes happens that, owing to the
failure of the sheath-cartilage to grow out sufficiently rapidly in the diagonal tracts,
the calcification of the more distal parts of the lamellz may occur in arch-cartilage
(fig. 8, A, p. 354, right upper diagonal ray).

On the other hand, such disregard of the origin of the cartilage is not shown
in the vertebrae of young Cetorhinus as compared with those of Squatina (fig. 13,
p. 360), the concentric lamelle of the former not being continued through the
diagonal cartilages. The explanation of this is probably to be found in the fact
that, while the intermedialia, in which the calcified lamellae occur, are increasing
by means of an external growing zone, the diagonal cartilages—basal parts of the
basidorsals and basiventrals—are increasing by a general and uniform radial
extension. In Syuatina the growing zone, here of sheath-origin, is continuous
all round.

It is clear from the difference in the origin of the concentric calcified lamelle in
the young Squatina and Cetorhinus, in the one case from sheath-cartilage, in the
other from perichondrially produced cartilage external to the notochordal sheath—

as also the difference in the origin of the radial calcified lamelle in Cestracion and
Lamna (fig. 4, A, p. 340, and fig. 9, B, p. 356), from sheath-cartilage and perichondrium
