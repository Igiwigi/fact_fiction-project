It may appear strange that the influence of the eastern tide should cease suddenly
when it reaches the Isle of Wight, not extending any further to the west. If, how-
ever, we look at the map, and obserye the sudden widening'of the channel to the west
of Cape La Hogue, we $hall be at no loss to conceive that the tide-waye may be ex-
tremely diminished by this rapid diffusion, as we know that the tides are greatly in-
creased by the gradual contraction of their beds in estuaries and rivers. But whether
or not this be the cause, the fact is indisputable in the observations, that to the east
of this point the tide-hour changes very little, while to the west it diminishes with
comparative rapidity. If it were at all doubtful that this difference arises from the interference of the
eastern tide as far as this point, the question would, I conceive, be settled by the two
following articles. 9.
