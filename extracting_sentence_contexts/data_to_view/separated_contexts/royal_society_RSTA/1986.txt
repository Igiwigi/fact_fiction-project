Similar
remarks would apply to the carbonic acid diffused through the air; while an almost
inappreciable admixture of any of the hydrocarbon vapours would produce great effects
on the terrestrial rays and produce corresponding changes of climate. It is not therefore
necessary to assume alterations in the density and height of the atmosphere, to account for
different amounts of heat being preserved to the earth at different times; a slight change in
its variable constituents would suffice for this. Such changes in fact may have produced all
the mutations of climate which the researches of geologists reveal.

wrote Tyndall [13,14]. It should be noted that Eunice Foote, whose bicentenary also falls in 1819
(1819-1888), had also shown in work published in 1856 the ability of carbon dioxide and water
vapour to absorb heat and made a link between the amount of water vapour and carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere and changes in the climate [15]

The highest effect of the sunâ€™s rays I have found to be in carbonic acid gas. ... Anatmosphere
of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature; and if as some suppose, at one
period of its history the air had mixed with it a larger proportion than at present, an
increased temperature from its own action as well as from increased weight must have
necessarily resulted

Tyndall and later workers do not appear to have known of her work, which was only recently
rediscovered [16].
