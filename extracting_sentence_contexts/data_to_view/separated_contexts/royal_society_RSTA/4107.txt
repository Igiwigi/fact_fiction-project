Within the diagonal approximation, only identical pairs of trajectories are taken into account. (Online version Ds

Therefore, the diagonal approximation yields the classical transition probability

are roughly the same. That this is in fact the case has also been observed numerically in [5].

(b) Coherent backscattering contribution

A second class of correlated pairs of trajectories are those shown in figure 2, namely y’=Ty,
where T denotes time reversal. For Bose-Hubbard systems, time reversal is achieved by complex
conjugation, such that the time reversal of a solution @(t+ tj) of the equations of motion is
(te — t)*. Of course, these pairs exist only if the Hamiltonian itself is time-reversal symmetric,
which for a Bose-Hubbard system corresponds to a real Hamiltonian.
