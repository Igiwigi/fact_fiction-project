in the former paper. This will be explained later.

6. The displacement, current, magnetic force, &c., at the point p’ will not be denoted
by D, C, H, &e., but by D’, 0’, H’, &., with which the former symbols are connected in a
way now to be described. In Maxwextt’s ‘Elect. and Mag.” 2nd ed., § 12, he*
remarks: ‘ Physical vector quantities may be divided into two classes, in one of
which the quantity is defined with reference to a line, while in the other the quantity
is defined with reference to an area. . . . In electrical science, electromotive and
magnetic intensity belong to the first class, being defined with reference to lines.
When we wish to indicate this fact we may refer to them as intensities. On the
other hand, electric and magnetic induction, and electric currents, belong to the
second class, being defined with reference to areas. When we wish to indicate this
fact we shall refer to them as fluxes.” Now in connecting dashed with undashed
letters it is absolutely necessary to bear in mind whether the vectors indicated are
intensities or fluxes. The connection between D and D’ will differ from that between
H and H’.

7. Nearly all the physical vectors at a point will belong then to one of the
following classes :—

Class I. Intensities.
(Examples: V, A, E, H, 0, d3/ds, ,V/.)

o being a vector of this class, the three allied vectors, o, o’, o”, are connected by
