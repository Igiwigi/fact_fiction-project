As some unsteadiness had been observed in the galvanometer readings for the leak
during the earlier observations, a series of experiments was made in order to examine
if the current from the wire varied when the conditions were kept as steady as
possible. When the current was passed through the wire the tube became hot and
gas was given off from the walls and from the hot wire, so that it was impossible to
keep the pressure absolutely constant. However, by continuously pumping out the
gas the pressure was kept practically constant, the limits of variation being very
small. A constant current was run through the wire so that its temperature and
resistance were invariable except in so far as they depended on the pressure of the
gas in the apparatus.

Since the rate of escape of heat from the wire is determined largely by the gas
pressure, the temperature of the wire is a function of the pressure. In fact, the
galvanometer spot was a far more sensitive indicator of the pressure than the McLeod
gauge. By carefully watching the galvanometer and pumping accordingly, the
variations of both pressure and temperature were kept very small indeed.

Under these conditions it was hoped that the rate of leak from the wire with a
constant voltage would remain approximately constant. It was found, however, that
it varied in the most haphazard manner, oscillating irregularly between the limits of
10-* and 10 amp√©re. The current did not become any steadier with continuous
heating. Readings taken every three or four minutes for the space of three hours
showed the same continuous irregular periodicity. The irregularities were quite
independent of the potential that was or had been applied to the wire, and also
seemed to have no relation to the rate at which gas was given off. There was no
