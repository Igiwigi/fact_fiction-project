2It was found (in 1861) at Breitenbach in Bohemia, at a spot not very far distant from
= the Saxon frontier, or indeed from Rittersgriin, in Saxony, a place in which a very fine
mass, that bears a close resemblance to the Siderolite of Breitenbach, was almost con-
Stemporaneously found. A little way to the west of the centre of the line joining Rit-
Stersgriin and Breitenbach lies Steinbach, a village in the environs of Johanngeorgenstadt,
&mear Schwartzenberg ; and here in 1751 was also found a mixed meteoric mass in which,
Sas in the two already mentioned, iron, sponge-like in its structure, encloses siliceous mi-
Snerals that do not present a familiar aspect. The three meteorites are, in fact, 80 similar
0 one another and $0 dissimilar to any others in European collections, that there can be
-Slittle doubt they belonged originally to the same meteoric fall. 3 STROMEYERÂ® in the year 1825 examined a siderolite in which he found as much as
S61-88 per cent. of silica.
