[23]. The thickness and, arguably, the stiffness of such a hybrid weldline are hence influenced
by the nature and geometry of the resistive element, which in turn can affect the stresses during
the SLS tests [20,21]. Indeed, our subsequent study on resistance welding of glass fibre-reinforced
PPS (GF/PPS) adherends [24] indicated that the size of the mesh resistive element dictates the
thickness of the weldline. This in turn was found to be linearly related to the SLS strength of
the welded joints (figure 2a). Different degrees of secondary bending during the SLS test for
different size meshes, as suggested by the experimental data in figure 2b, were believed to result in
different peel stresses at the weldline and consequently to cause the strength evolution observed
in figure 2a.

Second, the welding process may affect the adherends resulting in. e.g. deformed adherends
(induction weld in figure 1c) versus non-deformed adherends (ultrasonic and resistance welds in
figure 1a,b). In fact, there are welding processes such as susceptorless induction welding of carbon
