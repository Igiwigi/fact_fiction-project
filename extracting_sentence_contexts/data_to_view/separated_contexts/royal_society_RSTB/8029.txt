Unfortunately, the relative stratigraphical positions of these ammo-
nites are unknown. Stephanoceras pseudohumphriesi Cloos and S. pseudoblagdeni Cloos were named and described
but not figured by the late H. Cloos in his doctor’s thesis (1916). ‘To save others trouble it
is worth recording that in the hope of tracing either type material or unpublished illustra-
tions of these species I have written to: (1) Frau Cloos, (2) Marburg University, where
Cloos submitted the thesis for his degree, (3) Freiburg im Breisgau University, where he
wrote it and where Boehm lived, (4) Bonn University, where Cloos later held the Chair
of Geology, (5) Leiden University Museum, where Cloos stated the Nouhuys Collection
was housed, from which some of the material was sent, (6) Utrecht University, where the
Nouhuys Collection turned out in fact to be. Negative replies were received to all these
enquiries. The conclusion is that the types were in the private Boehm Collection and were
destroyed during the 1939-45 war, and that the illustrations either were not made (owing
to the 1914—18 war) or were destroyed or mislaid.
