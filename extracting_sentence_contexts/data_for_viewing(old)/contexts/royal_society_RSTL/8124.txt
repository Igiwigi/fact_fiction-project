would have resulted from this, and indeed from any restraint of the normal growth
forwards of the frontal bone, a large orbito-nasal angle consequent on the unrestrained
natural growth forwards of the lower part of the jaw; but the orbito-nasal angle does
not surpass 9(* in either skull. The base in both skulls is very level and deficient in
cranial curvature ; and both these peculiarities are best marked in the flattened ﬆknll,
in which also the arch is most deformed. 'The deformity of the arch longitudinally
consists in flattening of the frontal and occipital bones and bending of the parietals, as
exhibited by the large midfrontal and midoccipital angles and small midparietal angle.
Now this deformity of arch results from the cerebral mass being pressed out from the
grasp of the compressing agent, and this grasp presses as much downwards as upwards ;
and although it meets with more resistance in the downward than the upward direction,
the effect of the downward pressure is exhibited in the levelness of the base and the
deficient cranial curvature,—the action being, in fact, precisely of the same description
as has been already mentioned as occurring in the large Greek skull 46.

It is not, however, to be forgotten that, as has been pointed out by Professor TorxER *,
8nch skulls as these are not subjected to pressure during the whole period of growth, but
owe their deformity to pressure in infancy ; and the question remains, how it happens
that the deformed shape given to the infantile skull is preserved. Professor TURNER
suggests arrest of development from premature synostosis as the explanation, and his
own observations, together with those of Dr. Daxte, W1rsoN, show that in such skulls
there is great tendency to obliteration of sutures; while the flattened skull 96 gives an
instance of arrest of development of the roof-bones. But it is difficult to see how 8yn-
ostosis, although it may occur, accounts for the phenomena sought to be explained. To
