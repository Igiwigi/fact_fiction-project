On the other hand, the
blocks of tissue which were cut from these and other animals for rheotome experiments
never showed any such discrepancy. In these the difference was always such that the
dorsal end of the block was positive to the ventral end. It is needless to give
examples of this now, for the experiments which will be given will afford convincing
proof of the truth of this statement; but it may be stated that in 45 instances
in which the organ-current of a cut strip or block of tissue was observed and noted
there is no instance of the current being otherwise than +-, and that in all cases the
strength of the current far exceeded that which was observed in the case of the entire
animal,

The difference observed very early in the work between the organ-current in the eut-
out block of tissue, and that in the organ when in situ, suggested the view that the
increased current found to be present in the former tissue was dependent upon the
nature of the preparation—upon the fact that the piece of organ used was bounded by
incisions. It was, therefore, determined to ascertain how far such incisions did affect
the result. For this purpose the following experiment was carried out :-—A medium-
sized Torpedo, 18 centims.
