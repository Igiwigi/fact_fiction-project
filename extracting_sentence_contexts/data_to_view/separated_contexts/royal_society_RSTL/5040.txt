Art. 171. Q

A If we suppose the angle of incidence ezactly equal to 45%, as8ume + for the refractive index of
Zthe fluid, and apply Fresxer's formula to calculate the ratio of the intensity of light reflected
at the exterior surface of a bubble, and polarized in a plane perpendicular to the plane of inci-
Sdence, to that of light similarly reflected and polarized in that plane, we find 0-228 to 1, a ratio
=pyhich certainly differs much from one of equality. But in order to render the two intensities equal,
St is 8ufficient to increase the angle of incidence by only 3* 35'; and in fact, as a matter of con-
Fenience, the position of the observer was usually such that the deviation of the light was somewhat
Za than 90?, and therefore the angle of incidence somewhat greater than 45®. S Note F. Art. 191.
