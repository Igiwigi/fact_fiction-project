magnet was actuated by six GRovg's cells and then without any current in the M.C.,
or vice-vers4. The galvanometer was in such a position with reference to the electro-
magneb that the latter produced very little direct effect on the former, and since they

obtained momentarily an increase of potential at D compared with the potential at H

when the M.C. was passing, they inferred that the magnetization imparted by the
electromagnet to the wire decreased the resistance of the copper.

These experimenters, however, seem to have entirely overlooked the fact that the
powerful magnetization imparted by the magnet to the armatures would alter the
capability of the latter to receive fresh magnetism. Now, when the B.C. is closed at
E, the current in the coil of wire wrapped round the armatures would induce magnetism
in the latter, and this would in turn s8end an induced current through the eaoutchouc-
covered wire in the opposite direction to that of the original ; if, then, the capability of
