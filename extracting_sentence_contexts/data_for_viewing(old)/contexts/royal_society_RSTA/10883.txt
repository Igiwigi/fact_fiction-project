514 DRS. T, ANDERSON AND J. 8. FLETT ON THE ERUPTIONS OF THE

The theory of explosions has also won a certain number of adherents, among
whom are several distinguished American geologists. That there was an explosion
—a steam explosion—is, of course, admitted by all. But some hold that there
were also explosions of combustible gases attended by sheets of flame, and that
these took place either during or shortly after the outburst from the crater,
Our objection to these theories is that they have no sufficient basis of observed facts
on which to stand. Neither what we know about the gases in the cloud, nor the
recorded observations of eye-witnesses of the eruptions, make it in any way probable
that such explosions took place except on a minor scale, or that they had an essential
part in the propulsion of the discharges.

Many, of course, who saw the great black cloud emerge from Pelée or the Soufridre
describe it as welling out of the hill with sheets of flame. But students of volcanic
phenomena are too well acquainted with such descriptions to place any great reliance
upon them. The popular mind is not careful to distinguish between a mere
incandescent discharge, or the glow of the red-hot surface of the lava reflected from
overhanging clouds, and true sheets of flame. The belief in burning mountains dies
hard.
