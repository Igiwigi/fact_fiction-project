Ringer’s solution, washed, and incubated in the dopa reagent as described in part 1. The
perikarya and processes of the melanocytes, formerly blue, now blacken with the formation
of ‘dopa melanin’ (figures 6, 7, plate 9). No other cell blackens. There is therefore no
doubt that the dopa-positive and quinone-imine dye-positive cells of the basal layer of the
epidermis are melanocytes, and that melanocytes are specifically so revealed.

These results, in so far as they relate to the ‘dopa reaction’, merely confirm the opinions
of all experienced histologists. It should be added that the tyrosinase reaction will also
reveal melanocytes in the epidermis (Fitzpatrick, Becker, Lerner & Montgomery 1950),
and although the dopa and tyrosine reactions do not always go hand in hand (Foster 1952),
there are excellent grounds for believing that the dopa reaction is mediated by tyrosinases
and not, as was formerly believed, by enzymes specific to the dopa substrate (Fitzpatrick
et al. 1950; Lerner & Fitzpatrick 1950; Foster 1951). ‘The fact that quinone-imine dyes are
kept in the oxidized state in living melanocytes, though they are reduced in cells of most
other types, may perhaps also be a consequence of their oxidase content.

The dopa and methylene-blue reactions may be used to reveal melanocytes so weakly
pigmented (e.g. in white human skin; Billingham 1948) as to be indistinguishable in living
preparations of split skin. Neither reaction reveals dendritic cells in the basal layer of the
epidermis of white skin areas on recessively spotted guinea-pigs (cf. Ginsberg 1944).

Dopa-positive cells are found only in the basal layer of the epidermis. Their appearance
in vertical sections in more superficial layers is a consequence of the optical illusion
referred to in the footnote to p. 152. It will be clear later, however, that dye-positive cells
appear in superficial strata as well as in the basal layer.
