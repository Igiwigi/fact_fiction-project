The challenge is to find a way of computing heat transfer that at the
same time shows how it can be optimized. We follow the approach of our previous articles on
maximizing transport across an externally heated fluid layer [43-45], the key difference being
the presence of the internal source f(x, f). We show it is possible to bound (|VT|), and in fact to
compute it exactly in the steady case, by a pair of variational problems. These problems recall
Dirichlet’s principle for Poisson’s equation, but are non-local due to the mixed character of the
operator u - V — A. That there exists a non-local Dirichlet-like principle for the effective diffusivity
of a periodic or random fluid flow is well-known in homogenization [46,47].
