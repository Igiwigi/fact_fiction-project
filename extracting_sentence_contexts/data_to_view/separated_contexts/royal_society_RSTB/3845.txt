20 ; another example from the
same animal), In this animal left vagal stimulation moved the pacemaker away from
the left appendix, and towards the inferior cava. In confirmation of this suggestion
we have the facts that the direction of travel was unaltered across [. V.C. contacts and
appendix contacts (fig. 20); since it was altered across the S.A.N. contacts, the move
was in our view from a higher to a lower point in the Sâ€”A node; the shift was at all
times a small one; it is clear from the S.A.N. curve (fig. 20) that the pacemaker
never moved beyond the distal S.A.N. contact though it approached it very closely. In the same animal we used the electrodes, one upon the right appendix, the other
upon the right auricle. Before stimulation of the vagus, the appendix became
negative before the point on the body of the auricle ; during stimulation, and for one
cycle, the auricular contacts became negative first.
