a large series of experiments made by him on the effect of the small calibre rifle
bullet on tissues, &e. From a direct manometric observation of the pressure set up
by the bullet’s passage, he describes a rise of pressure equivalent to that of fifteen
atmospheres.

In all cases the most ‘“ explosive” effect was observed in the case of the brain in
the skull, the control being evidenced by the simple perforations of skulls emptied of
their contents.

A general survey of the results obtained by Bruns shows that the bursting effect
is in proportion to the velocity of the projectile; and we have repeated Kocumr’s
experiments, and have in every respect completely confirmed them. In view of the
fact that, so far as we are aware, no illustrations of such experiments have been
published, we append photographs of some of our own results.

Plate 3, fig. 4, shows photographs of two dried dogs’ skulls of similar strength. ‘The
skull shown as intact was fired at with a saloon pistol 22 cal., and merely perforated, as
is shown in the photograph, The other skull, which had been cleaned in pre-
cisely the same way, was fired at with the same pistol after the cranial cavity had
been filled with water and all the foramina closed with modeller’s wax, ‘The rending
effect of the water, starting the sutures, &c,, is particularly well shown. It may be
