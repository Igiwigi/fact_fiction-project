Besides these, a further removal of the indurated clayey
matrix has brought into view a large portion of a rib; and some other bones may not
improbably still be concealed in the mass, which has been left intact in order to
display the original juxtaposition of the remains.

"This magnificent specimen is of special interest, as being that to which Sir Came
LyELL, in his work on © The Antiquity of Man'®*, and Sir Joun LuBBock, in * Pre-
historic Times'F, refer, but with respect to which hw seem to have been not quite
correctly informed. Sir C. LYELL speaks of the © occurrence at one point in overlying
stalagmite of the bone of a Cave-Bear,” and of the © discovery at the same leyel in the
bone-earth, and in close proximity to a very perfect flint tool, of the entire left hind
leg of a Cave-Bear.” Although the argument, sought to be strengthened by the cir-
cumstances thus recorded (of the contemporancity of man with the Bear) is not mate-
rially affected by the correction, it is as well that this opportunity should be taken of
stating the facts exactly as they stand. The © bone ” above referred to by Sir CnarLEs LYELL as having been lodged in the
overlying stalagmite is a very perfect humerus of a Bear of small size, which was
found, in the position described, on the 30th July, 1858, at a distance of 67 feet
from the entrance of the Reindeer Gallery, or at pretty nearly the same distance as the
leg-bones; but it, was, as has been said, completely imbedded in the stalagmitic floor,
and consequently aboye the surface of the third bed, whilst the leg-bones lay at a
depth of upwards of 2 feet in the clayey bone-earth ; moreover, it was found at the
opposite or east side of the Gallery. It should also be stated that the humerus differs
from the other bones, not only in size, but very remarkably in its condition, which is
nearly white, and it is wholly unstained by dendritic deposit, whilst the leg-bones are
deeply coloured, very dendritic, and evidently of much higher antiquity.
