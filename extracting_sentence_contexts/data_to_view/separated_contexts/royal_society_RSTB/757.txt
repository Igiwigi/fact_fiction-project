The pelvic girdle, in this stage, corresponds pretty nearly with Miss Jounson’s
fig. 7 (18, Plate 27). The pre-ilium (Pr.Jlm.) is short, the post-ilium (Pt.J/m.)
longer and strongly curved ventrad, the pubis (Pub.) slender and nearly straight, the
ischium (Jsch.) broad and expanded distad. The pectineal process (pect.pr.) is
slightly below the level of the acetabulum, springing obviously from the pubis and
not from the ilium, and both pubis and ischium are nearly at right angles to the long
axis of the body, as shown by the fact that a vertical section through the acetabulum
takes in nearly the whole length of the ischium (Plate 15, fig. 193). AND DEVELOPMENT OF APTERYX. 99

The ischium and pubis are not continuous, as in Miss Jonnson’s figures, but are
separated by a layer of indifferent tissue extending downwards from the acetabulum,

Stage E (Plate 18, fig. 275). The more advanced condition of the pre- than of the post-ilium is very obvious.
