This relationship should be seriously affected by reflected waves. For a plane free
surface the displacement in P or SV should vary as 1/r?. The fact that the observed
motion is better represented by 1/r than by any other simple power relationship
suggests that there are other factors influencing the amplitude which have not been
allowed for in the theory. Voi. CCXXXVILâ€”A 3
