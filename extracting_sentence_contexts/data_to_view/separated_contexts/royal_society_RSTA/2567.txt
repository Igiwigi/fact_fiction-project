In Physics, you can afford speculations, mathematical guesswork usually stays very concrete and specific. Before becoming mathematical theorems such things as the asymptotic law of distribution of primes, or Dirichlet’s theorem
on primes in arithmetic progressions, and thousands of other similar results were experimental facts. It is exactly the possibility
of instantly switching the register, and checking weird speculation against irrevocable facts of life, that makes Mathematics
so unique. I am not trying to question the uppermost historical significance of Euclid’s book, which
questioned the standards of proofs accepted before that time, and which set new standards for
many centuries to come. Quite amazingly, many proofs in the later books, including Euclid’s
proof of the infinitude of primes, are proofs even for us.

e Actually, even at the university level people rarely seriously contemplate the proofs they
are telling to their students in the elementary courses.
