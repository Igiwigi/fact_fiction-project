Both simulated sequences showed some
variations in the identification results with almost the same standard deviation, making it difficult
to confirm which grid pattern is most suitable for the method employed. Systematic errors in local phase shifting algorithm can arise from framing a grid signal close
to binary one, black lines on a white background. Even though a high-contrasted grid pattern
is desirable regarding a reduction of spatial noise, the high-frequency content caused by a close
to bimodal grid distribution can locally introduce fictive distortion to framed grid images [15]. A positive effect of blurring was already presented in the case of direct extraction of strain

measurements [72]. Here, the beneficial effect of slight optical blurring of the grid image used : =
for the identification procedure is demonstrated by simply recreating a deformed sequence of : S
bimodal grid images and comparing the identification results obtained with a VFM processor 73
to the same image sequence with applied fast Fourier transform (FFT) blur.
