Using various transformations to add new conteNts and new rvs to the original system expands
itinto a larger system. Two types of expansions that are of particular interest are expansion-through-
joining and expansion-through-coarsening. Joining is defined as

‘ ‘ e ¢)_ pe
Rey RE > (RG, RE = RG, (3.2)

whereas coarsening is transformation
Ry id F, (Rj) = Ror (3.3)

c

In fact any other transformation Fy,...4,(Rj,,---

coarsening.

,Rj,) can be presented as joining followed by

Example 3.1 (joining). Consider the system

Rt | R} : c=1
Ro | RS : c=2
RE : R3 | c=3
