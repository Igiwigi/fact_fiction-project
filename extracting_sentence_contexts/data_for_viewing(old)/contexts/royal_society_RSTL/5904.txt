more than 9000 feet of a convex platform, which, according to S. v. WALTERSHAUSEN'S
measurement, is 4150 metres in its longest, or S.E. and N.W., and 3000 metres in its
shortest diameter.

a[The annexed outline view (fig. 17) will show the manner in which the modern cone(s)
rises from near the western margin of the platform (6%, c), which S. vox WALTERSHAUSEN
considers as the remnant of a crater named by him the © Cratere Elliptico” nearly filled
up, but part of the outer wall of which still remains, and which will be described in
the sequel. The area called the Piano del Lago, situated at a lower level to the south
of the highest cone, is regarded by the same observer as marking the site of another
distinct centre of eruption, or filled-up crater, 2600 metres in diameter; but T was
unable to verify this opinion, there appearing to me no sections sufficient to establish
the fact of a long-continued series of eruptions from any fixed point, other than the
present culminating focus. There is, however, such a tendency in volcanos to shift
their principal points of discharge, that, a geologist cannot object to 8uch an hypothesis,
if it can be sﬆhown that we can thereby best explain any observed phenomena ; and it
was probably owing to the limited period of my visit, that I failed to obtain proofs of two
adjoining craters formed by paroxysmal explosions and then afterwards filled up to the
lips by lava and scoriz.
