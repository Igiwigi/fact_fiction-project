The bar V V with its appendages was protected by a wooden box B of sufficient
8ize to permit of vibrations, which, as regards the resistance of the air, were practically
as free us in the open.* This box was provided with a window, E E, and two side-
doors, lined with caoutchoue 80 as to fit air-tight ; these side-doors were kept shut,
except when it was necessary to make fresh adjustments. The torsional vibrations of
the wire were observed by means of the usual mirror-and-scale arrangement, which is
sufficiently shown in fig. 1, where M is the light mirror reflecting an illuminated cirele
of light crossed by a vertical, fine, dark line on to a scale bent into an are of a cirele
of 1 metre radius, and placed at a distance of 1 metre from the mirror,

My three years' experience of the internal friction of metals had taught me that
this last is by no means constant unless the greatest care be taken to prevent slight
fluctuations of temperature. The above-mentioned fact seems to have escaped the
notice of MAXWELL and MgyeR, probably on account of the internal friction of the
metal having a considerably less damping effect than the resistance of the air in their
experiments. With me, however, especially in some cases, changes in the internal
friction of the metal would have rendered it very difficult, nay, impossible, to attain
the accuracy which I aimed at, and I deemed it advisable to protect the wire still
further, as follows ;â€”The top of the air-chamber W was well covered with baize, and
surrounding W, and concentric with it, was a larger air-chamber X, made of tinned
iron. This air-chamber was 114 inches in inner diameter, 15 inches in outer diameter,
and 46 inches in height; the two concentric chambers of which it was composed
enclosed between them a space 2 inches thick, stuffed with sawdust, whilst on the top
of the chamber was placed a double cover A, also packed with sawdust. Passing
through the outer air-chamber X, and through the walls of W, were two metal tubes
