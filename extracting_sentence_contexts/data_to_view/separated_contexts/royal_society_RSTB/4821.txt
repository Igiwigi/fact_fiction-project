P. CHATTOCK ON THE PHYSICS OF INCUBATION. 403

most turning and cooling. Much of the difference between the hatching of weighed and
unweighed eggs was subsequently found to have been accidental, and was due no doubt
to the fact that the two sets of eggs did not “ correspond”; but by that time a study had
been begun of the separate effects on hatching of turning and cooling, and this has proved
fruitful, as the following account shows: All the eggs in each incubator were turned twice
and cooled once as usual, but at three other times during the day every alternate row
of eggs was turned additionally. In this way the eggs were all cooled alike, but half of
them were turned five times instead of twice. ‘The results are given in Table II., where
4 under the heading “ Eggs hatched” means that a chick was helped out, helping
only being resorted to in cases where the chick was all but out already. Taste I1J.—Turning Experiments in Hot Air (Gloucester) Incubators.
