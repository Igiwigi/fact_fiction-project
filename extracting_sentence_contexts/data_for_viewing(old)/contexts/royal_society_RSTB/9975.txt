examines what happens when assumptions about the fidelity
of vertical transmission are relaxed and individuals can have
multiple preferences influencing fertility. This effectively
increases the rate of ‘lifestyle innovation’, dampening the
tendency for high-fertility preferences to become dominant,
and because individuals can now have preferences that
are different from their parents, low-fertility lifestyles can
persist [68].

4. Conceptual gaps and overlaps

A major roadblock to successfully integrating the CE and
HBE frameworks is the fact that different evolutionary
models often generate the same empirical predictions at the
individual level, making competing hypotheses difficult to
identify [8,11], and their different epistemological contri-
butions unclear. The following examples highlight some
aspects of this problem.

(a) Social learning as a proximate mechanism

An influential explanation of demographic transition is that
the real or perceived costs of children increase as living stan-
dards go up, with the opportunity costs to reproduction
becoming disproportionately large for the wealthy and
