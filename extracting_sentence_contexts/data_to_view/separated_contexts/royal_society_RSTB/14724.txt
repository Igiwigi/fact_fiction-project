Nest structures typically hold the eggs of oviparous species
and the offspring of both oviparous and viviparous species and, therefore, play
a key role in achieving reproductive success [1,3-5]. For example, Medina et al.
[5] showed that interspecific variation in the design of birds’ nests is an important
determinant of the evolutionary persistence, and thus success, of species. Never-
theless, our understanding of the evolutionary ecology of nests and nest building
has lagged behind our understanding of the later stages of reproduction, such as
incubation behaviours and offspring provisioning, despite the fact that nests—
including the large burrows of mammals and the enormous structures that
house colonies of eusocial insects—have long held a fascination for scientists [1]. The past decade or so, however, has seen an increasing focus on the nests
built by a range of nest-constructing taxa, including fishes, amphibians, birds,
