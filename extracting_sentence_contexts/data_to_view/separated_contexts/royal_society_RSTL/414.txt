This premature generalisation of a few imperfectly ascer-
tained facts, is perhaps equalled only by the mistake of Sir $
Isaac NewToN, who pronounced the construction of an
achromatic telescope to be incompatible with the known prin-
ciples of optics. Like NewrTox, too, MaLus himself aban-
doned the enquiry ; and even his learned associates in the
Institute, to whom he bequeathed the prosecution of his views,
have sought for fame in the investigation of other properties
of polarised light. In the summer of 1811, when my attention was first turned
to this subject, I repeated the experiments of Marvs, and
measured the polarising angles of a great number of trans-
parent bodies.
