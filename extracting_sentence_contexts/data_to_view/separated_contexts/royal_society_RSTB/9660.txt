Contrary to their Western middle-class peers,
they immediately execute requests and follow instructions
without hesitation [51]. They are also expected to run
chores independently based on prior learning: ‘if he sees
their dish somewhere the child will take it and bring to the
house’, explains a mother about adequate child behaviour. Running chores independently and without being reminded
is in fact a characteristic of a good memory and an intelligent
child [52]. Being able to contribute to the maintenance and
functioning of the household is the arena for the development
of self-worth and autonomy. Autonomy is already necessary
for learning, because learning is through observation and imi-
tation, not by instruction and didactic offerings.
