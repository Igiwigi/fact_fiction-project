SThe hyoid bar itself does not reach the cranium, but is fastened to the posterior side
Zof the quadrate by a broad ligament.
é In most of the Anura, however, this connexion is given up, and, instead of this, the
= proximal end of the hyoid is attached to the cranium, either by short ligaments, or it
6 may even be fused with the cranium, as in the adult of Pelobates or in Bufo. The hyoid
gin these cases resembles that of the Rajide. The fact that the point of the cranial
‘Zattachment of this “stylohyal” varies, indicates that it is a feature which was acquired
after its separation from the hyomandibula or ossicular chain had taken place inside the
& Anurous group. We can, therefore, not be astonished to find the stylohyal end
attached to any of the neighbouring cartilages or bones, which lend it the support
required. The auditory chain of Pelobates and Otilophus (fig. 9B) is very simple ; it
is let into the fenestra ovalis by a stapedial disk; this passes into a straight or a
curved slender rod (mediostapedial), the outer end of which is bent downwards
(extrastapedial), and is attached to the middle of the tympanum.
