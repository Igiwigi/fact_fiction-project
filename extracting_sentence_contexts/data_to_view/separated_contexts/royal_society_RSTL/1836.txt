Hauled up S. by W., to clear them. Saw something on the
reef like a ship's mast. Bearings by compass.”—

I examined the spot with a rigorous strictness, (see Plate VII.) ; and from
the various traverses which I made, in every direction, with the lead going by
night and by day, I feel prepared to assert that, no reef of the nature deseribed
by Captain LarmovuR in 1800, and no shoal of four fathoms water, could have
existed in 1814, How the said © four fathoms” crept into our charts, is best
known to the ship-chandlers who too long purveyed to the scientific wants of
seamen ; but from the absence of positive testimony, from the careful search
made þy order of Lord Kerry, from my own seyeral cruizes, and from the ma-
terial fact of its being in the high road which is annually beaten by hundreds
of ships, it is not presuming greatly to 8ay, that neither the one nor the other
had any existence. Nor is the assigned place © within a mile” of the position of the volcanic
islet, though it may accidentally have been s0 marked upon the © sea-cards ;”
for it should be remembered that the true site even of the principal headlands
around was not then decided. . According to the minute just quoted, corrected
for magnetic variation, LarmouR's supposed reef is no less than sixteen miles
W. by N. from it, on a part of the sub-aqueous plateau (which I named Ad-
venture Bank) uniting Sicily to Africa by a snccession of ridges,—about a
spot where I found from 40 to 50 fathoms of water.
