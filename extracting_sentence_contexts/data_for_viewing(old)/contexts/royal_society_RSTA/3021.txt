it, spatially uniform systems of which the components react chemically and diffuse may become
unstable and this instability may give way to the formation of stationary, stable, spatio-temporal
concentration patterns. The meeting turned out to be a non-event. Unfortunately, the times were
not ripe for the Turing—Prigogine discussion to be fruitful, i.e. to yield an adequate physical
clarification of the thermodynamics underlying the instability discovered by Turing. The gap
between mathematics and physics was still too broad to be bridged. On the mathematical side,
plentiful approximations and physical idealizations had to be made; on the fundamental side, the
understanding of non-equilibrium systems evolution was still in its childhood. In 1977, paying
homage to Turing in his autobiography [1], Prigogine simply tells us about their discussion
that!! ‘trop préoccupé sans doute, a l’époque par la thermodynamique linéaire je ne fus pas
suffisamment réceptif’.

In fact, the scientific community as a whole had not been receptive. Fourteen years after its
publication, the article by Turing had received few citations.!* It remained little known. After =
1966, this situation rapidly changed. On the chemical instability stage in Brussels, the arrival : 3
of Turing’s paper sets in motion a feverish reorientation of the research topic from oscillations
towards pattern formation. This led in 1967 to the formulation of the general physical concept mea)
of dissipative structure the relevance of which is today demonstrated beyond chemistry in :

To illustrate the phenomenon he predicts, Turing uses diverse versions of a complicated
reaction scheme (model) the intricacies of which are arduous to grasp. They involve up to nine
