4.3], and by remark 3.5.

(ii) Combining the result from (i) with theorem 3.1(v), we see that

Mor(H) = Mor(H_) = # conjugate points in (—0o, L)

for any L > L4. As Mor(H) does not depend on L, we conclude that there are no conjugate points
in (Loo, +00), and so Mor(H) is equal to the number of conjugate points in R.

(iii) This is equivalent to (ii), because Hy fails to be invertible precisely when L is a conjugate
point. a

Remark 4.3. The fact that Mor(H;) converges to Mor(H) as L > +00 has also been shown in
[33]. Here we used an alternative proof based on the arguments from [32] (see also [16]) where
the spectrum of the operator on the full line was approximated by the spectra of the operator
on [—L,L]. Unlike [33], this approach generalizes to operators which are not self-adjoint; this
is relevant as recent progress has been made in defining Maslov-like indices for such problems
(e.g. [34]).


Remark 4.4. It is also possible to prove theorem 4.1(ii) directly (without using part (i)) by
showing that E%(x,0) D = {0} for all x > Loo. If 0 ¢Sp(H), then ES (x, 0) NE" (x, 0) = {0} for all
x > 0, which in turn shows that E® (x,0) ® E4(x,0) = R?" for all x > 0. As the unstable dichotomy
subspace on R; can be taken to be any subspace which complements E% (x,0), we may therefore
choose E!} (x,0) = E¥ (x,0). Then by lemma 4.2(ii) we have E{ (x,0) ND = {0} for sufficiently large
