Fig. 33 shows a series
of these seeds drawn to the same scale. They vary from 3-5 to 7 mm. in length, and
from 2-2 to 5 mm. in breadth. We have no certain indications of their original form,
but they may have been flattened or platyspermic owing to the fact that almost
all the specimens when found show the curvature of the micropyle; had they been
symmetrical ellipsoids or pear-shaped we should have expected that in a large
percentage of specimens the bifid micropyle would be found projecting upwards or
downwards into the matrix as in fig. 33 (g), where the micropyle has been broken away. In this specimen, which was transferred from the matrix, a prominent ridge is seen
running down one surface of the seed, and in another example a similar ridge is seen
in a central position, suggesting that this form may have been more or less triangular
in section.

The surface of the tissue which remains is usually quite smooth, though in (f) we
have some fine ridges representing folds in the epidermis owing to contraction.
