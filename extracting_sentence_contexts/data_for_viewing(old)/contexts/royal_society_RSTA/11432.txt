or, the equation to the best value of B, (iii.) above, reduces to the regression
formula (ii.). In other words, no attempt to reconstruct the organ B from a linear
relation to the organs A,, A,... A, will give such a good result as the ordinary
regression formula.* This, of course, excludes all attempts to form type ratios of

A/B or B/A as a method of prediction. We may, in fact, at once dismiss all
reconstruction formule as insufficient which are not based on the theory of corre-
lution. The theory as here applied, be it noted, depends on the linearity of the
proposed formula and not on any special form of the distribution of variations.

(ii.) The accuracy of a prediction will not be indefinitely increased by increasing
the number of organs upon which the prediction is based. This fundamental fact of
the application of the theory of correlation to prediction has already been noticed by
Miss Anice Lee and myself in the case of barometric prediction.* The choice of
organs upon which to base the prediction is far more important. Thus, to illustrate
this from stature I may remark that the probable error of a prediction of male stature
from radius is to a prediction from femur in the ratio of 2°728 to 2174; that if one
takes both femur and tibia for the prediction, the probable error is only reduced to
