One contribution of 16 to a theme issue and (C3) in terms of (non)existence of ‘hidden
‘Contextuality and probability in quantum variables’ that determine the outcomes of all factually
mechanics and beyond’ performed measurements. It is generally believed

that the three meanings are equivalent, but the
Subject Areas: issues involved are not entirely transparent. Thus,

arguments have been offered that C2 may have

quantum physics, probability, philosophy of . . - :
nothing to do with C1, and the traditional formulation

science of C1 itself encounters difficulties when measurement

outcomes in a contextual system are treated as
