It appears that the mathematical discussion of the problem in his paper is un-
necessarily laborious,* and he has not made various important deductions as to the
integral results of distortion and as to the magnitude of the effects to be expected.
I, therefore, offer the following note with the intention of rendering more complete an
important chapter in the mechanics of geology.

When a spherical shell expands with rise of temperature, it may be said to stretch,
in one sense of the word. If the shell were one of the layers of the Earth, such a
Stretching would have no geological effect, for it would merely involve a change of
Hensity. The term “stretching” then requires an explanation in connection with.

.Davison’s paper. The stretching which we have to consider is, in fact, simply the

@xcess of the actual stretching above that due to rise of temperature. The negative
@f such stretching is a contraction, and it would actually be shown by a crumpling

6 if p be the density of a body, and ¢ its modulus of linear expansion for temperature,
®khen it is obvious that when the temperature is raised 0 degrees the density becomes
op (1 — 34). Now suppose that a spherical shell of radius 7 expands so that its
‘radius becomes 7(1-+ «), and suppose that at the same time its temperature is raised
0 degrees. Then, if & be the modulus of stretching, so that unit length is stretched
Sby a length k, we have, in consequence of the above explanation of stretching,
