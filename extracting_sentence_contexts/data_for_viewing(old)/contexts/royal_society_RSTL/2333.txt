air, heat, if a 8ubstance, should necessarily have non-conducting properties.

51. The converse of this reasoning furnishes additional evidence in favour of the
above conclusion ; it is a well-known fact, that the excitation of heat in good con-
ductors, such as the metals, is inimical to their conducting power. This result always
ensues in mixing a conducting with a non-conducting substance, and is also evident
in amalgamating a good conducting metal with an inferior one *,

This curious effect of heat in impairing the conducting power of metals, has been
elearly and beautifully illustrated by Sir Humeary Davy 4+. I have also arrived at
similar results #, and find, as stated by him, that heat in any way excited in metallic
conductors, whilst transmitting an electrical current, tends to impair their conducting
power. Mr. Carisw1E, likewise, has observed the same fact, as appears in his last in-
teresting paper on the Laws of Magneto-electric Induction .

52. Although the experiments in evidence of this influence of heat or metallic con-
ductors are numerous and very conclusive, yet opposite views have been adyanced by
Dr. Rrrcnrs in his paper on Electric Conduction ||. Dr. Rrrcate's principal experi-
ment consists in transmitting common electricity over a forked iron rod, one of the
legs of which he heated to redness : he finds, under these circumstances, that the
electricity will rather pass from the heated side, than from the cool side ; but this
result cannot be taken in evidence of the superior conducting power of the heated
iron, 80 long as the experiment is made in air, since, as has been just shown (48.), air
rarefied by heat, loses to a greater or less extent, its restraining power. Now the air
immediately in contact with an iron rod heated to redness, is necessarily in an ex-
