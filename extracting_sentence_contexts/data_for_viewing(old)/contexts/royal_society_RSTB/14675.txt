of modifications over time [15], created an environment
in which social norms became an increasingly powerful
influence on human development and behaviour [40].

(f) A key social norm was the creation of rights regarding
property ownership. Once private property rights were
established, socioeconomic inequalities began to emerge

as did major alterations to the physical and_ social
environment. Although the social norms governing pri-
vate property rights likely first started to emerge
during the Late Pleistocene (as evidenced by status arte-
facts such as grand burials), humans began to drive
environmental change more rapidly during the Holo-
cene, modifying energy flow via intensive agriculture,
deforestation and emitting greenhouse gases [41,42].

We wish to draw attention to the necessarily incomplete
nature of the model that we outline here, due to limitations
and uncertainty in the evidence available for reconstruction,
and the broad scope of enquiry. Direct evidence of key traits
such as cryptic ovulation, protolanguage, ‘mind-reading’, empa-
thy and cooperative defence are unlikely to be found in the
archaeological or paleontological record. Inferences, however,
may be reasoned from comparative analyses and other sources.
