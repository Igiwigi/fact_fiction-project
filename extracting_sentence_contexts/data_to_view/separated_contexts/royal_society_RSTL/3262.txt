I doubt this solution, first, because a very great
expansion is necessary, especially if we include in these movements the elevation of
the erratic blocks, now lying more than 2200 feet above the sea. Secondly, because
the movements appear to haye been of the same kind as those in the not distant
country of Sweden; and there it has been shown by Mr. Lye, that near Stockholm
an alternate movement of more than sixty feet has taken place within the human
period; and one is strongly tempted to believe that there is some relative connexion
between the areas in Northern Europe which are rising and those which are quietly
subsiding. These facts to be explicable on the theory of expansion, require, as it ap-
pears to me, far too capricious an action, in s0 s/owly and far-pervading an influence
as heat, to be admitted ; whilst on the supposition. of mechanical displacement such
difficulties are not presented. Thirdly, because (and it is my chief reason for reject-
ing the agency of expansion by itself)
