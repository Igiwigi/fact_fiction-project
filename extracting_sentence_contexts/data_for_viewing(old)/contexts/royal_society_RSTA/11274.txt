‘S[his indicates that a unipartite partition into the parts P,, P.,... P; may be
represented by a two-dimensional partition of another kind which involves the parts

of the nature of a regularised graph in the elements P,, P. — P,, Ps — P., though
these quantities are not necessarily in any specified order of magnitude. We obtain,

in fact, a mixed numerical and graphical representation of a partition of a new kind.
