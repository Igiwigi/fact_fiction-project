On determining the expansion of the metals by this method, I found that they did
not expand regularly between 0” and 100”, The difference, however, between the rates
of expansion between 0? and 50? and 50? and 100? was found to be s0 great that part of
it might be possibly attributed to errors in the determination of the coefficients of expan-
sion of water, as the coefficients of expansion of the metals are comparatively small
when compared with those of water. Now, although the coefficient of expansion of mer-
cury when determined by this method agrees with REGxXAavu1T's value, yet on account of
this value being large, small errors in the water coefficients will not materially influence
it ; for the yolume of water at

4*=1-0000, at 100*=1-04316,
that of mercury at
0*=1-0000, at 100*=1-01815,
and that of copper, for instance, at
0*=1-00000, at 100*=1004998,
Showing that the expansion of copper is yery small compared with that of water or
mercury. This fact led me to make another series of check experiments by determining the
linear expansion of a certain copper bar, as described in the first part of my paper above
quoted, and then weighing a piece of it, turned to the shape of a double cone, in water
at different temperatures. »

The following are the results obtained with the copper bar; and it may here be men-
tioned that copper does not behave in one respect like glass. 'The glass rods, as there
shown, do not return directly to their original length after being heated to 100?
