Such appearances suggest an approach to a
ed state of the sporangium, which, however, has not been found in any of
ts hitherto considered. The advantages of a partitioned condition, where
rangium is large, are plain enough ; not only would the nutritive surface

sporangium by animal, or other agency, would probably destroy the

From Isoetes, suggest the question whether such partitioned sporangia of the
adinous type occur, and, if so, in what plants ¢

riking answer to this question is, T believe, to be found in a genus of

ave already noted fluctuations in this dimension within the genus Lycopodium
are figs. 36, 58, 73), while Jscetes in which the potential archesporium is
ly sterilized to form the trabeculz, is a still more pronounced example among
ants. As will now be explained at length, it is in Tmesipteris that we
to find a comparatively simple septate sporangium, or synangium—which, on
round of the above considerations, appears to be a more efficient type of
ction than such trabecular sporangia as are seen in Jsoetes or Lepidodendron. PSILOTACEZ.

2 Psilotacere are a family which occupies a place somewhat apart from other
odinese, though they are usually classed with them; their conformation is in
ways distinct from that of other forms, while the two genera of the family,
silotwm and Tmesipteris, show fundamental similarity to one another, though
ntly distinct in details.
8 probably owing to their somewhat separate position, and their marked
avities, that they have been the subject of frequent discussion, both from the
1orphological, and also from the systematic point of view.
