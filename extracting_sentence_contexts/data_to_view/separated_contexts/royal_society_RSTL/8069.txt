Their general result is this :
2 that in the axis of a rectangular tube, at all parts except very near the ends, the action
© of external magnetic forces in planes normal to-the axis is absolutely destroyed. In the
2 second column for the Britannia Bridge there is one anomaly at Middle of Anglesey Water
8 Tube of which I can give no explanation. It is a certain fact of observation ; it may
5 arise from 8ome peculiar steely character of the iron in its neighbourhood. Putting this
= aside, the other numbers for the Britannia Bridge are exactly what we should have
> expected from a structure s0 closely resembling a bar magnet ; the longitudinal force is
SE greatly increased at the ends, but is diminished in all other points; not, however, as in
© the transversal forces, to its complete annihilation, but diminished by about one fourth
<= part. For all these cases the cireumstances of position of the bridge with respect to the
Ss magnetic meridian are fayourable.
