ASSOCIATION UNIT OF RESISTANCE IN ABSOLUTE MEASURE. 687

The same method of measurement was applied at the beginning of the third set, and
a watch was kept by means of the measuring rods already spoken of (p. 667). Slight
movements were in fact observed, principally of the nature of a recovery of the
telescope stand from the rather violent treatment to which it had been 8ubjected as a
test. Minute corrections are accordingly introduced into the tabular statement
(p. 693), 80 as to make the rezults of different days comparable. At the close of the
spinnings the direct measurement was repeated, when there appeared a slight dis-
crepancy between the results obtained by Mrs. Srpawick and myself. Tt is in fact
rather a difficult matter to say exactly when the pointer has advanced to the equilibrium
position of the centre of a 8uspended mirror, which cannot be prevented from swinging.
Although the amount in question was not important, I thonght it might be more
satisfactory to check the result by another method, and therefore arranged a travelling
mieroscope focussed alternately upon the centre of the mirror and upon a seratch on
the window of the magnet box, by which the distance between these two points was
determined. The remaining distance between the scratch and the scale was easily
measured with the rod. The result tended to confirm the smaller value previously
found. The value adopted for the spinnings of the third series before November 5 is

2668'8 millims,
