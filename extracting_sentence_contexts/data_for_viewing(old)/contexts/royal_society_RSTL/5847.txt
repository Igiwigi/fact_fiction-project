iodine is immediately evolved at the opposite terminal in a much larger quantity than
the former.

33. Tn the phenomena of the induction spark, time appears to be an important element,
at least it is 80 in the secondary coil as at present constructed ; experiment teaches us
that the effect from breaking is far more powerful than that from making contact. In
RUnMKORFy's coils we have, however, not only the induced effect from the primary cur-
rent, but we have the induced effect from the powerful electro-magnet; to attain the
maximum effect of the latter time is essential ®, particularly if the primary coil is formed
of several convolutions of the wire (* three convolutions are used by RUHMKORFF ”).

* Time, as is well known, is necessary for the development of electro-magnetism, and M. MAaTTEUCCH, in
his recent valuable book on induced electricity, has shown some remarkable results flowing from this fact.

10 MR. GASSIOT ON THE STRATIFICATIONS AND DARK BAND IN

If the wires or iron core are made of well-softened iron, although they require some
time to obtain their maximum power, they lose it instantly ; consequently the more
sudden the contact is broken, the clearer and more intense will the discharge appear in
vacuo.
