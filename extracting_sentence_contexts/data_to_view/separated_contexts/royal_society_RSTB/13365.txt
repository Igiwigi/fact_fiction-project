other ejaculate and oviductal traits is still in its infancy.

Figure 2. Morphological adaptations to sperm competition in birds. (a) In species undergoing more intense sperm competition (as measured by relative testes size) <=
males devote a higher proportion of their testes to sperm production [58]. (b) In species with larger testes, males produce more sperm per day [59].
