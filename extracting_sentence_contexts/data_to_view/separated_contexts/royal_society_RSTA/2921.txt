Then the conditions (F) and (G) were imposed, and the question
discussed whether it was possible to satisfy the equation by values of the pâ€™s,
numerically less than unity. Starting with Na, the result was that it was impossible. As, however, this might be due to the fact that another term was required in the
denominator, the work was repeated, using the formula D = m+p+a/m+B/m*. As
we have seen above, NaS (6) is in all probability a bad reading. If this be put aside,
it was found that it would be possible to satisfy the conditions and still bring in all
the other lines within observational errors.
