WARD ON THE ACTION OF LIGHT ON BACTERIA, 975

e is another source of possible error to tbe mentioned. I cannot do away
in degree of internal reflection from the inner surfaces of the glass and
es, and it is quite possible that a slight amount of over-lapping of the

ic-are spectrum, this internal reflection becomes very marked indeed.
although I used as narrow a slit as possible, in working with the solar-
T had to open it to at least 1 millim., and it is not improbable that this

rtainly of opinion that in fig. 14 the action appears to extend further into
n than is really the case, and that this is due to one or more of the causes
