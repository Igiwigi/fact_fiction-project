When different charges were taken, and the distance a b, fig. 17, made constant,
the numerical values varied with the charge, the forces being as the square of the
charge expressed in degrees of the electrometer. This was at least observed for all
the charges which could be fairly brought within the experimental range of the in-
strument. ;

37. The application of these results to the phenomenon of attraction by electrical
agency, is not a little interesting ; they in fact help us to a more complete perception
of this wonderful operation. We may perceive, for example, that when a conducting
substance charged with electricity attracts another conducting body in a free neutral
state, the electrical distribution is s0 disturbed in each as to cause an accumnlation
in the opposed parts a, b, fig. 17, inversely proportional to the square roots of the di-
stances. By the laws of electrical action, therefore, before explained, (4.) and (22.),
Exp. 18, we have eventually the whole force, as shown by the electrometer, as the
squares of the distances inversely.
