choice of orthonormal functions is motivated by the upcoming Gauss—Hermite quadrature : BS
(for phase-space discretization) [46] and the fact that the Hermite coefficients are tied to DNS
physically meaningful moments of the distribution function [42]. The variables &*, u* and 6* : S
are non-dimensionalized using a reference sound speed (based on a reference temperature and : 3

molecular mass) ,/kgT/imo. While not necessary for the expansion (and then later on truncation
and quadrature) process, the non-dimensionalization is essential in deriving a stable solver,
as it controls errors coming from higher-order components (not correctly recovered by the
approximation due to truncation and limited degrees of freedom in the quadrature).

The Hermite polynomials are defined as [47-49]
