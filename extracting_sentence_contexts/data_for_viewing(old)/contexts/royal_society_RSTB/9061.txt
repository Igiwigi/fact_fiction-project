opportunity to help than have the opportunity to breed. We
are currently exploring in more detail the implications of
using alternative metrics of fitness for our understanding of
selection on behavioural (e.g. social) and life-history traits.

In summary, using robust measures of relatedness, benefits
and costs from a long-term study, we have shown that long-
tailed tit helpers are altruistic because they incur direct fitness
costs from their cooperative behaviour. However, these costs
are outweighed by gains in indirect fitness, principally through
the increased recruitment of related offspring from helped
broods. Therefore, helping behaviour in this species is consist-
ent with Hamilton’s rule. This is despite the fact that
relatedness between helpers and the recipients of their care is,
on average, low relative to many other cooperatively breeding
species. Indeed, the relatively high benefits and low costs of
helping in long-tailed tits have selected for decision rules that
result in a substantial proportion of helpers caring for non-kin
even though they gain neither direct nor indirect fitness benefits
from doing so. Thus, we conclude that even though, on average,
Hamilton’s rule is satisfied, apparently maladaptive help for
non-kin occurs in long-tailed tits and would be expected to
occur in other kin-selected cooperative breeding systems.
