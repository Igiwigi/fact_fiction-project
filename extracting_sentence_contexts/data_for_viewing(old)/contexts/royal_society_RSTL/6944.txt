-as a simple curve on the surface,—the complete intersection by the plane 2=0 being in
"fact the last-mentioned conic, and the pair of lines

2=0, aa*+2hay+by*=0.

Quartic Scroll, Eighth Species, $(1, 3*), with a directris line, and a directriz skew
: eubic met twice by each generating line.

47. We 8ee, & priori, that the scroll is of the order 4, that is, a quartic scroll; in fact
for the scroll $(1, 1?) the order is =[m]+M (firs: memoir, p. 457), and we have here
m=3, M=h—4[mP=1—3=—2; that is, order =6—2, =4.
