He supposes that in the early morning the dew-covered leaves transpire

Sut slightly, while those which have been kept relatively dry by nyctitropism,

Branspire normally. He gives experimental evidence for this view, and adds that
Slew may remain on leaves for several hours, so that a considerable fraction of the

‘Bvailable daylight may be lost.

& If Sraut’s view is right, then the nocturnal closure of the stomata may be classed
with nyctitropism as an adaptation for avoiding a nocturnal lowering of the tempera-
ture. If, further, we accept Srant’s theory in its entirety, we may believe that
the nocturnal closure of stomata is useful by helping to prevent the deposition of

* The closure of the stomata of evergreens in the winter (as observed by Srant) suggests itself as a
kindred fact, but it seems more probable that this is an adaptation for water economy.

t Srauz in speaking, p. 73, of nyctitropic leaves whose stomata are open at night, remarks that they
are nevertheless less open than by day.
