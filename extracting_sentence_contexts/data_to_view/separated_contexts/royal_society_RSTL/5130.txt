In making sections of cartilage many of these granular cells escape from their
cavities in the hyaline tissue, and may be seen detached and floating about in the
field of the microscope. Some little confusion of terms has arisen in connexion
with this part of the subject. The granular cells are not unfrequently described
under the name of cartilage-nuclei containing nucleoli, while in fact they are cells
capable of separation from the matrix, and are at one period the only recognisable
cartilage cells. They occur singly or in groups, more frequently however two or
three are extended in a line. It is proposed in the present communication to call


124 MESSRS.
