I now write a {(at) (b) (c)...} = hereres 3
so that

Ni(Q06 03) aoe) eee aera
and it appears that
Pigaaes

is the true generating function of the numbers
N (abe...)
for the permutations of assemblages of numbers of all specifications. Tn fact,
Nato.. = SN (abe...) (par. Â» (gr ++) 3
and the expansion of
Figoiei

as a linear function of monomial symmetric functions gives a complete account of

numbers N (abe...)
