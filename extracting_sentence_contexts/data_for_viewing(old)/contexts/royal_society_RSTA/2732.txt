associated with radiation) [35]. However, a two wire transmission line radiates when one takes
into account the currents which do not lie in the axis of the transmission line. For example, current
flowing at the supply end and low end of the transmission line leads to a loop antenna like
effect [37].

The concept of explicit symmetry breaking has also been applied in experiments on generation
of tunable broadband radiation from a superconducting ring where a pulse of laser light
breaks the symmetry of cooper pairs, resulting in electromagnetic radiation [38]. Under explicit
symmetry breaking, the momentum current associated with the test charge loses its conserved
value within a localized region of space and time as the corresponding Noether current is the
driver of electromagnetic radiation.

An important goal of the current article is to underscore the fact that localized symmetry
breaking is expressed within the framework of Maxwellâ€™s equation on radiation, and it denotes a
close relationship between dependence of the force fields along temporal and spatial dimensions.
The rotation of the electric field expressed by curl of the vector E indicates that the symmetry
of the electric field along a set of dimensions in the physical space has been broken. Thus,

Figure 3. Explicit symmetry breaking of electric lines of force. (a) The changes in rotational symmetry in the electric field
distribution of a static positive charge under acceleration as discovered by Thomson [33], can be analysed from their perspective
of explicit symmetry breaking of the electric field. (b) When the dipole configuration of charges is subjected to time varying
acceleration, the symmetry of the electric field is explicitly broken periodically resulting in electromagnetic radiation which
