Our next hypothesis is that the membrane is incompressible. * We may justify
this assumption from the fact that the tissue is largely composed of water, and that
the only changes in volume arise when variations in pressure draw in extra blood from
the circulatory system or squeeze it out; but these changes will probably be small
unless the membrane is in a congested condition. Congestion, with consequent com-
pressibility, might be expected theoretically to cause a slight loosening of the tooth. There is, however, another way of approaching this question of incompressibility, which
is of interest.
