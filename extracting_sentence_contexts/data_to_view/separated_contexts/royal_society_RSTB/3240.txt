60 to 80, The statement that the Eutacta species are characterised by canals below
the bundles does not hold good ; in fact, with the exception of A. Rulez, the canals
are seldom met with under the veins. A noteworthy characteristic of the genus is the rich development of transfusion
tracheids (centripetal xylem); as this tissue has already been described by more
than one author, we do not propose to deal with it in detail. Reference may be
made to the papers of WorspeLL and Brrnarp,* and especially to the figures
published by the latter.
