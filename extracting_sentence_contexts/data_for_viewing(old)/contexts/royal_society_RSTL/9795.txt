some central apparatus, and 80 impelling the latter to a continuous, though fruitless,
endeavour at co-ordinating the absent feet. If the righting movements were wholly
independent of any such central apparatus, and due only to the serial action of the
feet, we should expect that (supposing the feet to be able to act serially in either
direction) when the equator position had been attained in shaved specimens, it would
not be maintained. For if there were no constant stimulus emanating from any co-
ordinating centre persistently trying to induce the absent feet to continue the serial
action in the same direction, we should expect, if serial action can take place in either
direction, that after a time it should begin to take place in the opposite direction ;
upon the supposition that the feet may act serially in either direction, there is no more
reason why a shaved Echinus should remain permanently reared upon its equator than
there is that ib should remain permanently inverted upon its pole, and therefore the
fact that in the latter position the feet seb about an immediate rotation of the animal,
while in the former and quite as unnatural position they hold the animal in persistent
stasis—this fact tends to show that the righting movements of the feet are 8omething
more than serial, The question, therefore, that we 8et ourselves to determine was,
whether the serial action of the feet invariably takes place in the direction of ab-oral
to oral pole, or may likewise take place in the opposite direction. We found that, it
may take place in the opposite direction, as the following observations prove. We
have een a shaved specimen, which after remaining for several hours on its equator
was accidentally rolled over into its normal position, forthwith begin to rear itself
upon its uninjured feet-rows. Executing this what we may call an inverted righting
movement with activity, the Echinus was speedily reared into the equatorial position
on the opposite ide to that from which it had just fallen—and in order tv do this, it
