edge is straight, and gives attachment to a small subopercular plate (Plates TLXVTI.
and LXIX. »), having a still smaller interoperculum (Plates LXVII. and LXIX. «)
fitted to its anterior margin. These are succeeded below by the branchiostegous rays
described in a former part of this memoir. 'This arrangement of the opercular appa-
ratus corresponds with that of some of the extinct fossil fighes. The preoperculum is
wanting. The external characters of the cranial envelope tend to the conclusion that
the dermal crust was very feebly developed in this region, and lead to the further
inference that a proportionate deficiency would be found in other parts of the tegu-
mentary covering. "This was probably the case, for with the exception of *the scales
investing the caudal fin, no trace has been discovered of the dermal plates, 80 charac-
teristic of the recent Sturgeon. 'The negative evidence of the non-existence of this
peculiar feature is strengthened by the fact, that of all the component tissues these
dermal plates are the most indestructible, and would therefore have resisted decompo-
sition more effectually than other more tender parts, which are nevertheless found in
the fossil state. The broad nuchal scale, for instance, 80 prominent in the recent
Sturgeon, would have left some trace of its existence in specimens, where not only the
surrounding bones, but even the semicartilaginous remains of the subjacent vertebral
neural arches, are distinctly preserved.

Another feature bearing upon this question is seen in the natatory organs. In the
recent Sturgeon, the dorsal, anal, and caudal fins are each provided with a short anterior
spine springing from a dermal plate, whereas in the fossil species no such spine-bearing
scales occur, the first fin-rays being supported by interapophysial osselets, as in other
bony fishes. In one specimen examined by me, a portion of the skin is preserved.
