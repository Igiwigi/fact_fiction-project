death, except the most sudden, arising from causes which s0 impress the ner-
vous system as instantly to destroy all the functions, those of the sensitive
system are the first which cease. The animal only dies when his means of
enjoyment and intercourse with the world which surrounds him, no longer
exist. This consequence is constant and never long delayed. It is necessary
therefore to a clear view of the state of the functions of the animal body in
sleep, to determine the bonds of union between the sensitive and vital systems;
at first view s0 distinct, which render their existence, except for a very limited
time, inseparable.

That the sensitive cannot exist independently of the vital system, is evident,
on the slightest consideration ; but the dependence of the latter on the former
is much less 80. The facts stated in the paper just referred to, prove that in
the more perfect animals, the function of respiration, being the only vital
function which requires the cooperation of the sensitive system, is here the
bond of union. It appears from those facts that the muscles of respiration
are, in the strictest sense, muscles of voluntary motion, the excitement of

which consequently depends on the powers of that system. When the power
of sensation wholly ceases, we cease to breathe.

So confused have been the ideas of physiologists on this part of the snbject,
