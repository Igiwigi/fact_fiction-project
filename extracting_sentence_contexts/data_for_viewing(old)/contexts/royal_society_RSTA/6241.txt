R, there is very good agreement in the trend between the time series of R and the corresponding
observed increase in the first PC (figures 8 and 9). Similarly, when R drops and remains
below one, we also observe a inflection in the first PC. This agreement suggests that the PC is
strongly correlated with R (Spearmanâ€™s coefficient p = 0.84 and p = 0.72 for the UK and England,
respectively), and hence, PC may feasibly provide a viable additional quantity for fast nowcasting
of the pandemic.

4. Conclusion

Overall across nations, our results suggest that hospitalizations are consistently important as a
representative indicator of the state of the pandemic at any given time point, being highlighted
as outside the standard linear combinations of the other variables in most analyses. This matches
the fact that these are likely to be relatively unbiased compared with cases [14] and less age- or
health status-specific than MVBs. MVBs are also expected to be limited by capacity, unlike the
overall hospital admissions, the former of which policy has changed significantly over the course
of the pandemic [15]. The combination of results from S-mode and T-mode analyses at different
scales allow for a greater understanding of the pandemic at different levels.

Elsewhere in this issue, alternative approaches have been proposed for calculation or R from
cases only [16,17]; however, our approach utilizes all available data streams and is also able to
find additional second-order structures in the data.

In some analyses, the epidemic trends can also be driven by the number of reported
cases, notably in Scotland, where non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), particularly in the
populated central belt incorporating Glasgow and Edinburgh, were maintained much longer over
