deduction has been made on this account, there remains, as the solid nucleus of the
science, the combinations of carbon and the gaseous elements, which hold in the theory
of chemistry a position 8omewhat analogous to that occupied in astronomy by our solar
system, as the area of exact observation.

Srovron VIIL—ON THE APPARENT EXCEPTIONS TO THE LAW OF PRIME FACTORS.

(1) On proceeding with the construction of the symbols of chemical substances, it will
be found that in a certain limited number of-cases the primary equations are apparently
of 8nch a nature as to render impossible the expression in them of the 8ymbols by means
of the same system of prime factors e, x, &, . - . by which the symbols in other cages can
be expressed. | It is probable that this anomaly admits of a very simple explanation,
but it is not without interest to consider the modifications which such a fact, if it were
truly established, would render necessary in our chemical ideas.

The density of sal-ammoniac in the gaseous condition, as experimentally determined,
