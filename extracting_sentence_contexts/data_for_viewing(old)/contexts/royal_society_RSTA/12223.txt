§ 4. The Influence of Pressure on the Velocity of the Explosion Wave.

Preliminary experiments on the rate of explosion of hydrogen and cxygen under
500 mm. and 1000 mm. pressure having shown an ‘appreciable difference, careful

measurements of the rate were made at pressures varying from 200 mm. to 1500 mm.
at a temperature close to 10°C. In the experiments at low pressures it was, of
course, essential that the firing tube should be absolutely gas-tight; the tube was
therefore tested before each experiment. An important fact concerning the develop-
ment of the explosion-wave was detected in these experiments. As the pressure was
reduced the flame was found to travel a greater distance before its rate became con-
stant ; so that, although four feet start was allowed before the first measurement was
taken, this distance was found insufficient. Accordingly a tube 20 feet long was
interposed between the firing point and the first bridge, after it had been shown that
& the flame acquired its maximum velocity in this distance under the lowest pressure
“used. Electrolytic gas can be exploded under lower pressures than 200 mm., but the
= flame travels irregularly. At 100 mm. pressure the flame went out in the tube, and
2 at 150 mm. the rates found were not constant.
