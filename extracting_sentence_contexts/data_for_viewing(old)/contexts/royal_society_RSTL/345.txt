Dissection of an Hermaphrodite Dog, 171

'" The glands which secrete milk, although in themselves not
organs of generation, entirely belong to them, and form a part
of the-female character, sufficiently obvious to connect them
intimately with the present subject. L

That an animal not a perfect female, should have glands
which secrete milk, or indeed” that an animal truly female,
without having had young, should give milk, is so extraordi-

tion toentitle it to credit; in this respect, the following fact must”
be considered as perfectly satisfactory.

An instance of an hermaphrodite bull, whose udder secreted
milk, occurred lately in Poland. The animal came into the pos-
session of Mr. Brookes, who procured it near Grodno, in the year
1796, and carried it to St. Petersburg, where it died in the follow-
ing year; unfortunately, no examination was made after death.

While the animal was at St. Petersburg, both Dr. RoctrsoN
and Dr. Rogers had opportunities of examining it with a con-
siderable degree of accuracy; and the following account is
taken from their description, with which I have been favoured
