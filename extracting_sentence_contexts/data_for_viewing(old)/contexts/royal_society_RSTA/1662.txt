The Borel o-algebra B(X) coincides with the o-algebra &(X) generated by the cylindrical sets,
ie., the sets of the form C = {x € X: (f,(x),...,fn(x)) € Co}, where fi,...,fn € X* and Co € B(R"), see
e.g. [3, Ch. 1]. Accordingly, a function f : X > R is called cylindrical if there are f,,...,fn € X* and
g:R" > Rsuch that f(x) = g(f1(%),.. -,fn(x)).

If X is a Hilbert space, we denote by (.,-) its inner product. (X) and 2(X) denote the
subspaces of ./(X) of nuclear self-adjoint and Hilbert-Schmidt operators, respectively.

(a) Symmetric and positive operators

An operator Q € #(X*, X) is called symmetric if g(Qf) =f(Qg) for every f, g € X* and positive if
f(Qf) = 0 for every f €X* (in fact, the right word should be ‘non-negative’ but we adopt the
common terminology). As usual, if X is a Hilbert space, we identify X and X*, and the above
notions correspond respectively to a self-adjoint and non-negative Q € .(X).

If Qis symmetric and positive, there exists a unique Hilbert space Hg continuously embedded
in X, such that Q(X*) is dense in Hg and (Qf, Q8) He =g(Qf), for every f, g € X*, see [3, Prop.
IIL1.6]. Denoting by i: Hg > X the embedding we have |lill 2(Hg,x) = Relleseene and ioi*=Q;
see [3, Chapter III]. Hg may be equivalently constructed by completing Q(X*) with respect to
the norm associated with the inner product (Qf, Qg) +> g(Qf). It is easily seen that every Cauchy
sequence (Qf,) in such norm converges in X, and two equivalent Cauchy sequences converge in
X to the same limit. Identifying (the equivalence class of) any Cauchy sequence (Qfn) with its
X-limit h, the completion is identified with Hg.
