resistance was removed. ‘The only part of the heating circuit which remained was
the battery of twelve storage cells and the adjustable resistance used to regulate the
current. The magnitude of the latter was determined by means of a small vertical
ammeter, reading up to 4 ampéres, which was inserted in the circuit.

The first experiments were made with the apparatus shown in fig. 6, and were
pushed to very high temperatures. In fact, THE MAXIMUM CURRENT FROM THE
FILAMENT T0 THE ALUMINIUM ELECTRODE REACHED THE ENORMOUS VALUE OF
1°5 AMPERE PER SQUARE CENTIMETRE OF CARBON SURFACE. ‘These experiments were
made with a lamp which possessed a small air leak that had been stopped by
embedding in paraffin in the manner already described. When the greatest currents
were put on the lamp became hot so that the paraffin melted and the pressure inside
the apparatus rose to 1 millim. During the course of the experiments the pressure
was therefore not constant, but increased gradually from ‘006 millim. to 1 millim.
The potential on the filament was — 250 volts, and was sufficient to saturate the
eurrent at all the pressures concerned. The results of these observations are shown
graphically in the accompanying diagram (fig. 14). The values of the ordinates are
successively multiplied by ten as we move to the left from one curve to the next.
