the whole of a fine summer's day, and not become active until near sunset. The case
is the same with nearly the whole tribe of Sphinges and Moths, while many Butter-
flies which are active during sunshine, will often remain for two or three days, when
the weather is gloomy, affixed to the very same spot. The common Honey Bee, Apis
mellifica, LixN., notwithstanding the bustle and activity of the hive, enjoys its share
of repose as well as other insects, even amidst the apparent commotion of its own
dwelling. Huzex observed that his bees often inserted their heads and part of their
bodies into the empty combs, and remained there for a considerable time. They
were then quietly sleeping in the cells. At other times they appear to 8leep for short
intervals on the surface of the combs. I have seen them towards the latter end of
Summer sleeping in the cells in great numbers for many hours together. It is there
also where many of them pass a portion of their winter, doubtless in a state of hyber-
nation, or most profound sleep; and it is an interesting fact, that this inactivity of
the inhabitants of the hive during winter, is accompanied by a diminution of heat in

their dwelling, as I shall presently have an opportunity of proving. The common
Humble Bee, Bombus terrestris, eyen in the month of April, will continue in a state
of rest* approaching to the condition of hybernation for at least twenty hours, while
its temperature becomes diminished in proportion to the diminution of its quantity
of respiration, which also is diminished in proportion to the length of time it remains
in a state of rest. This is always the case with insects when the temperature of the
surrounding atmosphere is stationary. But if the temperature of the atmosphere is
