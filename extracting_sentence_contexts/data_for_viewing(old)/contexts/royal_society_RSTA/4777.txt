Figure 1. The design of an optical component using transformation optics. (a) The electromagnetic space, expressed in
a Cartesian coordinate system. (b) The same electromagnetic space expressed in a deformed coordinate system, in which
x’ = f(x,y) and y’ = y. The black lines represent the old coordinate lines viewed from the new coordinate system. (c) The
physical space, which contains the metamaterial implementation of the curved electromagnetic space (b). (Online version in

First and foremost, the equivalence relations of transformation optics are valid for the full-
wave Maxwell equations. Indeed, in contrast to optical conformal mapping, transformation optics
successfully incorporates geometrical concepts to manipulate the wavelike behaviour of light,
a regime that is known to be incompatible with the geometrical concepts used in the eikonal
approximation. This can be understood from the fact that conformal transformations transform
only the Helmholtz equation with form invariance. In the case of media with inhomogeneous
permittivity and permeability, however, one needs to make a short-wavelength approximation
to put the wave equation for the electromagnetic fields in the Helmholtz form. Variations of the
refractive index profile will thus introduce unwanted distortions in the propagation expected
from the conformal map. Transformation optics overcomes this approximation by transforming
the full Maxwell equations.

This is why it is somewhat misleading to denominate the red line in figure 1 as the ray
trajectory of light. It is more correct to identify the line with the flow of electromagnetic energy,
ie. Poynting’s vector. In this manuscript, we highlight this undervalued aspect of transformation
optics by investigating applications whose functionality goes beyond the ray approximation. The
