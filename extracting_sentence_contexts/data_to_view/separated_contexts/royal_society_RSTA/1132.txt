Do not occupy yourself with them [the essences of Arsenic and Sulphur] unless you
already know the secret of the process ... Only if you know the secret, God willing, will you
accomplish the work’ (translated by Heym [24], p. 191). In fact, it looks likely that earlier Greek alchemists were already familiar with ammonia and
ammonium salts. For example, characteristic steps from the al-Razi process given above can be
found in writings of the Greek alchemist Zosimus (e.g. [25], pp. 30-33; [26], pp. 486-492) and in
those attributed to Democritus (e.g. [27], p. $91; electronic supplementary material, §3). There is
also a question about the oldest name for sal ammoniac.
