With all deference to the opinion
of this great man, it by no means explains why the surface of the skin was
kept comparatively cool. From the result of the experiments detailed, it is
evident, that if a black surface absorbs caloric in greatest quantity, it also gives
it out in the same proportion ; and thus a circulation of heat is as it were
established, calculated to promote the insensible perspiration, and to keep the
body cool. This view is confirmed by the observed fact of the stronger odour
exhaled by the bodies of black people. * Dr. Franklin's Works, vol. ii. p. 109, London, 1806.
