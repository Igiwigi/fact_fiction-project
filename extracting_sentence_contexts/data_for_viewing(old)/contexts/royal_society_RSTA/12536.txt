travelling that distance. This is probably a greater difference than can be allowed
between observation and a correct theory. M. Mott's observations, which seem to
be standard authority, were taken with such precautions that an error of 1 in
40 seconds can hardly be admitted. They likewise agree remarkably well with
Mr. Gotpineuaw’s observations at Madras.

In taking astronomical observations of the same kind with the same instrument,
g it has lately been discovered that two individuals differ sensibly from each other.
This has led to the suspicion that in all observations there is a personal error due to
some obscure physiological cause that allows a small interval of time between
sensation and perception, or volition. If this were the same for the sense of hearing
as for vision, it could not affect the results of experiments on sound ; but it is quite
possible that it may be different, and the very fact that such personal errors do
exist, may justify a suspicion that such an effect might interfere and prevent a
perfect degree of accuracy from being obtained.

We have made no hypothesis of the nature of the impinging surfaces of the
molecules. May the discrepancy arise from something omitted in this ?

In other media, according to this theory, the velocity varies as the inverse square
root of their specific gravity, and at different temperatures as the square root of the
absolute temperatures. It depends wholly on the thermometer, and is quite inde-
