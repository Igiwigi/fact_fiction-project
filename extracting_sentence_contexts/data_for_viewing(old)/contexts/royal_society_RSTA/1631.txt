w(L(u)) > 0 if and only if infoe(L(u)) > 0. Thus there are situations where the hypotheses of

(3.19)



theorem 3.10 are satisfied without any restriction on the partial Lipschitz moduli of p and R at
(u,0). On the other hand, with X = Y a Hilbert space and L(j1) self-adjoint, theorem 3.8 can cover
cases where inf o¢(L()) < 0 < sup o¢(L(2)), whereas (3.18) is not satisfied in such situations.

Proof. The proof is the same as for theorem 3.8 except that lemma 3.6 is used instead of lemma
3.2. To see that the hypotheses of lemma 3.6(ii) are satisfied at all points € in (u — 6, u + 5)\{u} for
some 6 > 0 it is sufficient to note the following facts, recalling that case (b) can be reduced to case
(a). First of all,
