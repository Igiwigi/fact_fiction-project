Professors GotcH and Horstxy obtained with intense stimuli a slight response on
the side of immediate section, but with ordinary stimuli no effect. They explain it
spkowise upon the supposition of a heightened reflex. = 1 may here point out the phenomenon of the increased reflex after hemisections
rrerved by Brown-SéQuarD.
‘5 When a motor area or one hemisphere is removed, or a complete hemisection made in
te quadrigeminal region, there are bilateral fits, in spite of the fact that the opposite
Byramid is completely degenerate. 4 The fits wre modified wpon the side opposite to the lesion, the clonus being less
Barked the first fit may be absent or very small. Ss = We have shown reasons for explaining these phenomena by the presence of direct
Bierl pyramidal fibres derived from the sound pyramid, for, if after a hemisphere is
moved and degeneration has taken place in the opposite pyramid, a hemisection is
Bu on the side of the degenerate pyramid, it instantly arrests the fits wpon that side.
