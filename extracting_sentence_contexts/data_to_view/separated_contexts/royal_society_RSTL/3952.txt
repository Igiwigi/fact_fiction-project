Crown-glass
shows it, but in a still smaller degree.

2177. Whilst employing erystalline bodies as diamagneties, I generally gave them
that, position in which they did not affect the polarized ray, and then induced the
magnetic curves through them. | As a class, they seemed to resist the assumption of
the rotating state. Rock-salt and fluor-spar gave. evidence of the power in a slight
degree; and I think that a erystal of alum did the same, but its ray length in the
transparent part was 80 small that T could not ascertain the. fact decisively. Two
specimens of transparent fluor, lent me by Mr. Texxaxr, gave the effect.
