For a particular
monthly mean value of cloud amount we have taken the average of the readings
at all the hours of observation available to us. There is a high negative correlation between sunshine duration and cloud
amount, the coefficients for anomalies taken during the same month being respec-
tively

0-74, —0-85, —0-84, —0-72 (n = 85)
for the four quarters of the year, at Douglas, and
—0-82, —0-89, —0-88, —0-65 (n= 24)

for the four quarters of the year, at Southport. This correlation corresponds to the
fact that corresponding significant entries in Tables XII and XIII have opposite
signs. 298 J. PROUDMAN, H. M. LEWIS, AND A. L. DENNIS
