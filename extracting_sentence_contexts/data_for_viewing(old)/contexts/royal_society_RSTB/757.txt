opposite the twenty-third to the twenty-sixth, the total number of somites being
forty, or only four fewer than in the present stage of Apteryz.

In the adult both of Aptery« and Gallus the fore-limb lies in the transverse plane
of about the sixteenth or seventeenth vertebra, the hind-limb in that of about the
thirtieth or thirty-second. Thus while in Gallus the limbs undergo, subsequently
to the fourth day, a backward shifting equal to the length of about six to eight
mesoblastic somites, in an Apteryx of the corresponding age the adult position is
already attained.

The ontogenetic shifting of the limbs of birds is very generally taken as evidence
of a corresponding phylogenetic shifting. If this conclusion is correct—and there
seems no reason to doubt it—the fact just described would seem to show that the
interval separating Apteryx from its hypothetical short-necked ancestor is a wider
one than has intervened in the case of Gallus. It must be remembered, however,
that, according to Firerincer (11, p. 977), a forward displacement of the limbs
occasionally occurs instead of the usual backward displacement, especially in the case
of species with degenerating wings.

The first two visceral folds (mandibular, Mn., and hyoid, Hy.) are considerably
larger than the third, fourth, and fifth (figs. 19-21, Br., 1, 2, and 3), The superior
maxillary process was not visible externally, nor can any trace of it be seen in
sections ; in this respect the resemblance is closer to a Chick of the third than to
one of the fourth day (compare 10, figs. 56 and 67).
