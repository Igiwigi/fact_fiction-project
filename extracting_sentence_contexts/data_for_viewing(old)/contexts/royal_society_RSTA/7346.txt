cos yk,,, = siny cot yncot ni 7 sin FG; es y = Msn yf

and as i_, > 0 so that y ~ 41, this quantity tends to the limit nk,./kp, a number like
80 or 100 for any conventional aeroplane.

kp, is, on our hypothesis, zero at i
machine.

k,., like k,,,, is infinite; but, like f;,,,
cos yk,, can be written z,/kp, and this is a number like 15 or 20 at standard diving
incidence.

_» = 0; it is in fact quite negligible for an actual

it occurs only in combination with cosy. Now

kp, is ignored.

We now proceed to consider the numerical values of «, A, 7, s’ for ordinary aeroplanes.
