The nymphs of Heptagenia are similar to those of Hedyonurus, and in certain cases
the resemblance is so close that they can be hardly distinguished. Inthe former the
lamelle are narrowly lanceolate and do not help to support the animal on the sub-
stratum. So far as the form of the body and the legs is concerned, Heptagenia shows an
advance on the Eedyonurus type, as also in the fact that the spines on the posterior
border of the segments on the dorsal surface are still further reduced. -The nymphs of
Heptagenia have failed to utilise their gill lamella for the purpose of adhesion, and thus
the advantage gained in the flattening of the body and the legs is counterbalanced. The Eedyonurus and the Heptagenia nymphs have been modelled along slightly different
lines to withstand an equally swift current. Heptagenia appears to have reached the
climax of modification along its line, while the gill lamellae of Hedyonurus, by further
modifications, have been instrumental in the production of the highly modified genera
of Heptageniide.
