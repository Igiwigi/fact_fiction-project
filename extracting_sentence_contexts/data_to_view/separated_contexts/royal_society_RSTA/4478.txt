Current climate
change is putting the Earth system outside the parameters of the last two millennia (e.g. [37]). Two
mutually interacting complex systems are driven beyond their traditional operating parameters. The risk of discovering some of the unknown unknowns in those complex systems therefore
cannot be ignored—and the fact that we can recognize that risk attests to the fact that even
unknown unknowns need not be entirely unknowable. In summary, the articles by Freeman et al., Kennett & Marwan, Bentley & O’Brien and
Parker & Risbey show how various forms of uncertainty can nonetheless provide constraints on



recommended future actions—and hence how actionable knowledge can arise from uncertainty. ls |
We find it particularly notable that a more compelling case for climate mitigation can be made
based on an increase in uncertainty (Freeman et al.), and even based on the recognition of “3
unknown unknowns (Parker & Risbey). :
Two other articles provide a detailed quantitative analysis of the implications of uncertainty
surrounding climate change. Risbey ef al. [38] analyse the historical odds of winning various bets
on the evolution of global temperatures and examine how those odds are likely to change in the
future.
