Here the experimental philoſopher may
be indulged in a triumph; and I really think your lords
of the admiralty ought in gratitude to erect ſtatues to
the induſtrious and ſucceſsful proſecutors of that noble

The only part of the food of our Northern people,
that does not come under the deſcription given, is falt
meat and fiſh; the latter they eat during their faits
where freſh fiſh cannot he procured, at leaſt not upon
terms that ſuit their circumſtances; and there are alſo

all theſe caſes they managetocorrect the action of this ad-
ditional leavenof putridity-by-mixture with their prepared
vegetables, in ſfucha manner as to clude its baneful effects,
which furniſhes me with another corroborating proof of
the powerful antiſeptic qualities. of this mode of prepa-
ration, which I ſhall particularly 'deſcribe, and; what/in
fact is the main purpoſe of this paper, in hopes-thereby
to throw ſome additional light upon the new antiſcor-
” butic ſyſtem which cannot be too: well underitood, and
in hopes that ſome of the: many diſhes 1 ſhall deſcribe of
a ſimilar nature with your ſour cabbage now-in uſe in
the Britiſh navy, may be thought worth a place in your
marine antiſcorbutic bill of fare; and if Iam fo happy as
to contribute to the preſervation of the lives, of the gal=
lant corps of men that enables us to plant our cabbages
in ſafety at home, I ſhall think my trouble well re-
warded. One of their principal articles of food, and what enters
into the compoſition of moſt of the Ruſſian ſoups, is
their ſour cabbage, which you are already ſo well ac-
quainted with, both as to the preparation and qualities of
it, that it becomes unneceffary to do:more than juſt give
it the firſt place in detailing their antiſcorbutic diſhes,
which it certainly merits.

The ſecond capital article is called quaſs, a liquor
which not only ſerves them for drink, but alſo as ſauce
to a number of diſhes, eſpecially to ſuch as have a ten-
dency to bring on the diſeaſe which their ſituation
threatens, and is the baſis of the favourite cold ſoup of
the North, which is made by adding cold meat cut in
pieces with cucumbers (prepared after a manner to be
deſcribed in the ſequel) or with onions, or garlick, to a
bowl of this ſab-acid liquor. This ſeems to be a good
method of qualifying and eating alt meat to thoſe that
are fond of the acid taſte, and ſhould make the proceſs
in the ſtomach very different from what we muſt ſup-

mentary mixtures.
