£ \The minute deflections produced by bisnIphide of carbon and sulphuric ether had
> othing to do with liquid films, 80 that the words *no action ” might have been
titten against these 8ubstances as against the others. While therefore recognising
= he fact of condensation, these simple experiments prove how incorrect it is to credit
= he condensed films with the effects which have been ascribed to them. According to
Tacxus, alcohol exhibits a force of vapour-hesion particularly strong: but we here see
Z hat even this yapour produces no sensible effect. The vapours have been tested with
S ther gources of heat, with the same rexult.
The deportment of dry and humid air is, as usual, very instructive, When the thin
-3 late of rocksalt resting on the naked face of the pile, was exposed to the common
Z ir of the laboratory, it, of course, contracted a film corresponding to the humidity

X ion indicating cold. When, on the contrary, humid air was urged against the alt,
& he deflection indicating heat was prompt and large. We have now to tesb the
= etion of the liquid film thus formed upon radiant heat. The circular plate of rock-
S alt before referred to was mounted, with the incandescent spiral on one side and the
