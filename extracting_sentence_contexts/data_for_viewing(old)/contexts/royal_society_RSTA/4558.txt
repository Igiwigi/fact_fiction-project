We first develop the general economic framework that underlies our analysis in §2a. We
represent an increase in uncertainty as a mean-preserving spread (MPS). Probability distribution
Bis an MPS of probability distribution A, if it spreads out some portions of A’s probability density
function but has the same mean as A. For example, posit that A has temperature increases of
1°C, 2°C and 3°C with likelihoods 20%, 60% and 20%, respectively. B has temperature increases
of 1°C, 1.5°C, 2°C, 2.5°C and 3°C with likelihoods 20%, 20%, 20%, 20% and 20%, respectively.
B has spread out A’s distribution around 2°C but has the same mean as A. It is thus an MPS
of A.

In §2b, we consider the impact of an MPS on the distribution of future temperatures. We
demonstrate that the description of climate sensitivity in Assessment Report 5 [9] could be
seen as an MPS of the description in Assessment Report 4 [8]. Thus, despite the fact that the
IPCC’s 2013 position on climate sensitivity might superficially be viewed as ‘good’ news, our
analysis shows that a reasonable interpretation of the results would conclude otherwise: WTP
goes up.

In §2c, we turn to increases in the standard deviation of the distribution of climate sensitivity.
Every MPS falls into this category when the increase in variance is mean-preserving, but the
converse is not true. Therefore, §2c contains a strictly broader category of increased risk than §2b.
We demonstrate that WTP can increase, even when expected climate sensitivity decreases, under
a broad range of conditions.

In §2d, we turn our attention to the situation where there is also uncertainty over future
economic conditions and consider the case when consumption growth is correlated with
