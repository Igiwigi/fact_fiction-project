DERIVATION OF THE BOUNDARY-LAYER EQUATIONS

It is convenient to begin from the general equations of motion of a fluid all of whose
physical properties vary; in vector notation these equations are (Crocco 1939; Emmons &
Brainerd 1941; Cope 1942):

The equation of continuity or conservation of mass:

od =0. (3-1)
The Navier-Stokes equation or conservation of momentum:
pd = pF—Vp-+ 40% +4uV4 +2{(Vp) V}9+ (Vx) L-BA(Ve)- (3-2)
The energy equation or conservation of energy:
pe + pd =8+V{(KV) T}. : (3:3)

In none of the references cited above is this equation given in its most general terms. Careful examination of its derivation shows that (3-3) is restricted neither to a perfect gas
nor to one whose specific heats are constant, but is applicable to any fluid provided E is
a function of T only. The dissipation function is given by

& = wl2V{(9V) 93+ 0 —29V4 —§4?], (3-4)
and is unaffected in form by the fact that viscosity is a variable. An alternative form of the energy equation can be obtained in terms of the enthalpy; it is

pa —# = 6+. V{(KV) T}, (3:5)
but since in this form it is now assumed that both EF and Jare functions of T only this equation
is necessarily restricted to a perfect gas, but no restriction to constant specific heats is as
yet implied.
