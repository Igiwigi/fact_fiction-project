possible in 1995, in parallel with the operation of LEP (this was not the first or the last of Rubbia’s
claims that proved over-optimistic: during the ICFA workshop he had asserted that the LHC
could be built for less than $400 million). The group noted that a 2 TeV electron-positron collider
would have comparable ‘reach’ to the LHC, and could enable detailed study of phenomena
discovered at the LHC or SSC, but was not technically feasible.

The group further noted that the ‘Lesser energy of LHC [relative to SSC] can be partially
‘recovered’ with the help of a larger luminosity’, but ‘experiments at more than 10° will require
novel instrumentation’, and recommended intensified R&D on high field magnets.

(c) Magnet R&D and evolution of the design of the Large Hadron Collider

Magnet R&D for the LHC (by Brianti, Perin, Leroy, Rossi and others) had in fact already started
in 1986. In 1988, a single bore 1m magnet designed at CERN and built by Ansaldo reached 9T
at 1.8K. In 1991-1993, CERN’s first 2-in-1 magnets (which were 1-1.3m in length) also reached
9T. The first long (10m, still shorter than the final length of 14m) 2-in-1 magnet did not operate
until March 1994, after the proposal to build the LHC had been formally presented to the CERN
Council. However, it worked well with excellent field quality (the SSC eschewed the 2-in-1 design,
which would have lowered the cost, following bad experiences at Isabelle and fearing that a single
2-in-1 magnetic structure could compromise the field quality: given the width of the tunnel, 2-in-1
magnets were mandatory for the LHC).

Meanwhile, 2-in-1 quadrupole magnets had been developed by a CERN-CEA collaboration.
These were combined with three 10m dipoles to create a 1/8 sector ‘string’ which operated
successfully in November 1994, shortly before the CERN Council approved the LHC.
