During the closing phases of the last glacial stage that had predominated the
climate system for previous 100000 years or so, a number of plant species
became adapted to an emergent human environment independently at different
centres around the globe. This process led to the evolution of domesticated and
commensal species. Initially, the evolution of domestication involved the selec-
tion of a characteristic group of traits collectively termed the domestication
syndrome [1,2]. These traits, which included the loss of shattering, changes in
seed size, loss of photoperiod sensitivity and changes in plant and floral archi-
tecture [3], enabled the better survival of plants in the human environment.
That this was an adaptation to the human environment by plants is emphasized
by the fact that a number of non-food plants such as small-seeded grasses and
legumes also adapted to this environment under the same regime of cultivation
and became commensals, and indeed also display traits of the domestication
syndrome [4-6].

Evolution is an interminable process, and the story of the evolution of dom-
estication did not end with the emergence of those first adaptors to the human
environment. Some of the commensals later went on to become domesticated
crops themselves, such as in the case of oats and rye (reviewed in reference
[7]). The human environment to which the plants had adapted was dynamic
and presented plants with new challenges, resulting in new adaptations and
