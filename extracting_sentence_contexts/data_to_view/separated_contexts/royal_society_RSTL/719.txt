258 Mr. KN1GurT on the'Reproduction of Buds.

nature will come into action : and as nature, amidst all its exu-
berance, does not abound in useless productions, the opinions
of this: jllustrious physiologist -are, in this. case, probably
erroneous. Other naturalists have supposed the buds, when reproduced,
to spring from the plexus of vessels which constitutes the
internal bark ; and this opinion is, I believe, much entertained
by modern botanists : it nevertheless appears to be unfounded,
as the facts I shall proceed to state will evince. If the fruit-stalks of the sea cale (crambe maritima) be cut
off near the ground in the spring, the medullary substance,
within that part -of the stalk which remains attached to the
root, decays; and a cup is thus formed in which water collects
in the succeeding winter. -The sides of this cup consist/of a
woody substance, which in its texture and office, and mode of
generation, agrees perfectly with the alburnum of trees ; and
I conceive it to be as perfect alburnum, as the white wood of
the oak or elm: and from the interior part 'of this substance,
within the cup, I have frequently observed new buds to. be
generated in the ensuing spring. It is sufficiently obvious that
the buds in this case do not spring from the bark ; but it is not
equally evident that they might not have sprung from some
remains of the medulla.
