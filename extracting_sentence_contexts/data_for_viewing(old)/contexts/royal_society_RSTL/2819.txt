LIEUT, NEWBOLD ON THE IPOH POISON, 429

native names of the plants I have mentioned will, it is hoped, afford botanists visiting
the Straits of Malacca, or the islands of the Indian Archipelago, some clue to a more
scientific investigation, both of the plants of which the poison is composed, and of
its antidote, the Lemmah-kapiting. With regard to the 1pok tree of the Malay penin-
sula, from the description of it given to me by the natives, I much question its iden-
tity with the Anchar or Upas tree of the Javan forests, described by Dr. HorsFieLD,
and the Arbor tozicaria of RHuMerlIvUs.

It may be superfluous to add, that in the wildest tales related to me by the abo-
rigines regarding the deadly qualities of this poison, there is nothing to corroborate
or give rise to the extravagant fictions with which Fogrscu 80 easily amused the cre-
dulity of half Europe.
