of gold and silver fishes are carefully propagated, and with
us, what are vulgarly called © fancy pigeons” are bred into
most whimsical deviations from their parent stock. As wild animals and plants are not liable to the same varia-
tions, and as all the variations seem to increase with the degree
of artificial restraint imposed, and as certain animals become
adapted by extraordinary changes to extraordinary conditions,
it may &till be expected that some leading fact will eventually
furnish a clue, by which organic varieties may be better ex-
plained. A few generations of wild rabbits, or of pheasants
under the influences of confinement, break their natural co-
lours, and leave the fur and feathers of their future progeny
uncertainly variegated. The very remarkable changes of the
colour of the fur of the hare, and the feathers of the partridge
in high northern latitudes, during the prevalence of the now,
and the adaptation of that change of colour to their better
security, are coincidences out of the course of chance, and not
easily explained by our present state of plysical knowledge.
