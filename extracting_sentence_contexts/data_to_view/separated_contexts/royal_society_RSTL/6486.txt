We thus
obtain for the complete differential coefficient of det (P, Q)

det (P, D, (Q))+det (D(P), Q).


AND DETERMINANTS OF LINES. 481

We have therefore the equation
D,{det (P, Q)}=det {P, D, (Q)} +det {D\(P), Q}. The same equation may also be proved by considering the algebraical determinants

which represent the projections of det (P, Q); and it may in fact be easily deduced from
the following identical equation,
£ (4:04 —4,0:)= (Fr, p.) = (s: BW, F)-

formulze(T.) and (I1.)
