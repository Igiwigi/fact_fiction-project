The total percentage of cultures infected works out at 2-6—a small number considering
that no sterile chamber was used for making them. It is of interest to note that only two of 106 cultures of adult lung were infected. This
I attribute largely to the fact that the implants were always taken from just beneath
the pleura, and hence contained only the smaller bronchi. The large number of cultures is justified by two considerations. Firstly, the fact that
the phenomena of invasion of the medium are best studied by the cover-slip slide method,
while the changes within the implant can only be elucidated by making sections of it
after tube cultivation made it necessary to duplicate each series or stage in tube and
