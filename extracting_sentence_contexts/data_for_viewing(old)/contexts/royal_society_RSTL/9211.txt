(7) In conclusion, I may mention an interesting fact which is probably connected with
the summation of stimuli before explained. When a contractile strip is allowed to rest
for a minute or more, and a wave is then made to traverse it, careful observation will show
that the passage of this wave is slower than that of its snccessor, provided the latter
follows the former after not too great an interval of time. The difference, however, is
exceedingly slight, s0 that to render it apparent at all the longest possible strips must
be nsed; and even then the experimenter may fail to detect the difference, unless he
has been accustomed to signalling, by which method all these observations on rate have
to be made.

(B) Stimulus-waves.â€”(a) The rate of transmission of tentacular waves is only one
half that of contractile waves, viz. 9 inches a second. This fact appeared to me very
remarkable, in view of the consideration that the tentacular wave is the optical expres-
Sion of a stimulus-wave, and that there can be no conceivable nse in a stimulus-
wave being able to pass through contractile tissue independently of a contractile
wave, unless the former is able to travel more rapidly than the latter ; for the only
conceivable use of the stimulus-wave is to establish physiological harmony between
different parts of the organism ; and if this wave cannot travel more rapidly than a
contractile wave which starts from the same point, it would clearly fail to perform this
function.

In view of this anomaly I was led to think that if the rate of the stimulus-wave
is dependent in a large degree on the strength of the stimulus that starts it, the slow
rate of 9 inches a second might be more than doubled, if, instead of using a stimulus
