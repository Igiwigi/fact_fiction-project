lux most obvious and regular result of passing a current of electricity through the
“solution of a salt is the simultaneous appearance at the two electrodes of products of
‘ghemical decomposition. Since the intervening solution is unaltered, and the products
Spppeat only at the electrodes, the motion of the parts of the salt in opposite directions
Sthrough the solution is a necessary hypothesis, and the idea of ionic velocity is at
-Zonce suggested.
z The facts of ordinary chemical action, as well as those of electrolysis, require us to
suppose that a continual molecular interchange of partners is going on, but how this
.2takes place, whether by means of “ free ions” or by means of the fractional number
2of collisions which the mechanical theory teaches us will occur with sufficient violence
sto bring about separation and possible rearrangement, remains an open question, and
Sone which it is not necessary to consider for our present purpose. The point is that
Ech a motion in opposite directions must occur, and the ions move with a definite
‘gaverage velocity through any given solution. This is independent of any particular
Ehypothesis as to the nature of the active electrolytic molecule, and need not commit
Bus either to the “ dissociation ” or to the “ chemical ” theory.
