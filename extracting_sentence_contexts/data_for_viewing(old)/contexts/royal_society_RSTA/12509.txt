§ 10. Reference to the Moon's True Transit.

The intervals have been referred to the transits of a fictitious satellite whose R. A.
is equal to 7, and we now require corrections so as to refer to the moon’s true transit.


PROFESSOR G. H. DARWIN ON TIDAL PREDICTION. 185

Let T, T’ be the times of true and fictitious transits, and let # be the moon’s R. A
Then if ¢ denotes the mean solar hour angle at time T,

t+h—-a=q7,
aud, dropping the suffix o to 7, at time He
t+h—l=qrz,
