Prerrer (1901) as a lens of ectodermal origin, a statement of the accuracy of which
there can be little doubt. The fact that the supporting fibres enter its substance
shows that the lens cannot be of a cuticular derivation, and that it must be regarded,
not as a product of secretion of the epithelial cells but as part of the epithelial cells
themselves, and as such must contain a portion of the supporting fibres. The cuticle
(cut.) remains as a thin covering, closely applied to the outer surface of the lens.

The epithelial lining of the optic cup is composed of two types of cell—the
pigmented cell (pig. c.) and the sensory elements (oft. s.c.). The former are in shape
very similar to, but are in length much shorter than, the general epithelial cells of the
cord, and can be distinguished from them by the smaller size of their nuclei, for while

the nucleus of the epithelial cell is about 4 » in diameter, that of the pigmented cell
is only about 2-5 ».
