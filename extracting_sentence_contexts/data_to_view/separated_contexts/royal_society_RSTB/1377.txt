IZATION OF THE FOSSIL PLANTS OF THE COAL-MEASURES. 893

across a branch at some little distance from its actual base, we often find
culiar structure, already described and figured in former memoirs.* The
section of the branch shows no well-defined pith and no clear traces of
y groups of xylem. It consists of a parenchymatous mass, into which
etrate in all directions from the surrounding secondary wood. These
tracheides describe strange curves, and extend as far as the middle of the
utting up the parenchyma into isolated groups.t In fact, in these cases, as
> the branch outwards, its structure, instead of approaching more nearly to
the normal Calamitean stem, becomes more and more anomalous. Such a
e is in fact totally different from that of a Calamites or any other known
‘From the sections of Mr. Witp’s specimen we know that no such peculiarities
Bd in a normal branch, at any point, from its base upwards.
