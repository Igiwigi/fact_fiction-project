flattening them in a direction perpendicular to the line of force, and 80 causing cleavage
structure, in the manner 80 admirably illustrated by Mr. Sony's experiment on pipeclay
and scales of iron, and by Mr. Trxpair's experiment on wax. In the meantime the
solid pebbles have not yielded sensibly, but show the effect of the enormous pressure
they have been subjected to, by developing internally a latent cleaved structure, predis-
posing them to split most readily along planes perpendicular to the line of maximum
force. In this manner I would account for the splitting of the quartz pebbles in the
planes of cleavage; while, in the case of the joint planes which were formed 8wbse-
quently, I conceive that the rock was consolidated, and the quartz pebbles held fast in
their now hardened paste, while the shrinking took place perpendicular to the planes of
minimum tenslon. ;

This mode of viewing the subject is confirmed by the fact, that in cleaved limestone
districts, the distorted fossils are divided by the joints in well-cut planes, showing that
the rock was consolidated when the joints were formed, although the distortion of the
tossil proves that the rock was soft when the cleavage took place.

4. Cleavage Planes.

My attention was originally directed to the study of the physical geology of the red
sandstone conglomerate of Waterford by the observation of two cireumstances; the first
of these was the rectangular prismatic appearance of the conglomerate cliffs already
described ; and the second was the detection of an inner structure of a peculiar cha-
racter, which enabled me readily to distinguish the cleavage from the joint planes. 1
found that the coarse conglomerate had in many places acquired a platy or flaggy
