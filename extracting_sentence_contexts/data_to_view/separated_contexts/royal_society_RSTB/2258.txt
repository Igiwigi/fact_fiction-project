The longer threads generally
appear to be broken up into strings of darkly-staining granules, owing doubtless to

x the character of the membrane which, being mucilaginous, is easily swollen. 3 In some transverse sections of the inner phloem a young medullary ray may occur,

8 the cells of which may be distinguished by the fact that radial threads are present

& piercing the tangential wall. The young medullary-ray cells appear at first to con-

sist almost entirely of companion or albuminous cells; but in the older cotyledons

&% starch-containing medullary-ray cells are also present. = The cambial zone between the phloem and xylem is composed of thin-walled

=, rectangular cells in whose walls threads have not yet been very successfully demon-

6 strated, though they are without doubt present.t Russow states that he has seen

2 threads with ease in cambium,} but this statement needs further confirmation.
