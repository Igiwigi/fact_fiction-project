and consequently aboye the surface of the third bed, whilst the leg-bones lay at a
depth of upwards of 2 feet in the clayey bone-earth ; moreover, it was found at the
opposite or east side of the Gallery. It should also be stated that the humerus differs
from the other bones, not only in size, but very remarkably in its condition, which is
nearly white, and it is wholly unstained by dendritic deposit, whilst the leg-bones are
deeply coloured, very dendritic, and evidently of much higher antiquity. Nor does
it appear that either the humerus or the leg-bones were found in close proximity to a
flint implement. Three implements of the kind only can be referred to in speaking of
theee bones, viz. those numbered 1, 2, 3 in Mr. PexcGeLLY's Report. Of these, Nos.
1 and 2 were found nearest the leg-bones. They were both found on the 29th July,
1858, 74 feet from the entrance, and 9 inches deep in the third bed, 7. e. 12 feet south
and 15 inches above the level of the leg-bones, or 7 feet south and 9 or 10 inches
deeper than the humerus ; they were, in fact, deposited immediately beneath the spot
where the great antler was found on the upper surface of the stalagmite. The third
flint implement was found the next day at a distance of 47 feet from the entrance, and
34 inches deep in the third bed.

A second instance of the same kind, and equally tending to show the probability that
these remains must have lain almost undisturbed from the period of their sepulture,
whilst still surrounded by the soft parts, or at any rate connected by ligaments, is
afforded in the remains, evidently belonging to one and the same young Bear, which
