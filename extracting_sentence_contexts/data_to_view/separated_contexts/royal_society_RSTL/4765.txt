Nobody will be surprised at this, who
has made himself acquainted with the difficulty of effecting the above-mentioned reac-

of these compounds, and the horrible odour which some of them Po88Cs88. Pau Tufixarr's remarkable researches did not excite, at the time of their publication.
that degree of interest which they really deserved. There were but few facts known, at
that period, with which his results could naturally be connected ; indeed, until after the
ammonia-bases were discovered, the importance of the experiments on these phosphorus-
bodies could scarcely be recognized ; then it was that M. Paul Tufxarp's investigations

parallelism of the compounds of phosphorus and nitrogen, more and more disti
exhibited by these discoveries, began to become an object of general interest to
chemists. p
