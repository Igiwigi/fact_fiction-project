There is an independent prm in A.

The sulcus precentralis superior (prs) is the same in A as in B, but in B it has
two sections and reaches with its end the mesial border. The gyrus centralis anterior
‘is not cut as in the left hemisphere.

pri measures in A 29 mm.; in B 26 mm. taken in straight lines.

These differences are due to the fact that in A the prm is parallel with pri on
its lower, and with prs on its higher part. Without prm the measurement would
be 55, nearly the same as on the left hemispheres.

The main resemblance is the cutting of the gyrus centralis anterior by a ramus
horizontalis, which exists in both left and not in both right hemispheres. The
left B has more resemblance to the left A than to its own homologue right
hemisphere.

The suleus frontalis mesialis (fms) is badly developed in A, and exists only on
the superior part. In B fms is divided into three pieces; the superior does not join
prs, the inferior does not join fma.’
