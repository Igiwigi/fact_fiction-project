RICHARDS ON PHYLLOTAXIS

will approach, though not in general precisely realize, the condition described as ortho-
stichous, i.e. the fourteenth leaf will be nearly superposed longitudinally over the first. Plantefol stresses not only that the genetic spiral is an abstraction, a conclusion with which
few would now disagree, but, much more debatably, accords it no part in practical dis-
cussions of phyllotaxis. Even if his theory be accepted, however, the simple facts of diver-
gence, with the accompanying approximate leaf superpositions, cannot be disregarded
altogether. In terms of this theory consideration of ‘divergence’ along the foliar helices
should therefore replace that of divergence along the genetic spiral. Thus, where three
foliar helices are recognized, in the large majority of spiral systems (cf.
