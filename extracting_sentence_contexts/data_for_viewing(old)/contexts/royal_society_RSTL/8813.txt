feet 32%2 P., and S1x's thermometer, corrected for pressure, gave 31*6. This latter is
the only recorded instance in the open sea where his reading was below zero of Centigrade.
His most northern observations, viz. in 76* 13'N, and 12% 48' E., at 1296 feet, and
another in the same place in 2103 feet, gave respectively 33*4 and 323; while one of
Scoressr's, in 79” N. and 5* 40' E., at 2400 feet gives, corrected, 34*6 F., and another in
76? 16' N., 9* E., at 1380 feet, not far from Marmixs's poxsition, gives, without allowance
for pressure (for in this case S1x's thermometer does not appear to haye been used), a
temperature of 33%3.

ManrrTixs, however, states that on approaching the land in Magdalena Bay, instead
of a submarine temperature above zero, he found that in depths of from 110 to 136
metres the temperature of the water was always below zero; that these bottom-
waters there had, in fact, a temperature of —1*75 C. to —1*:91 C. (28*6 F.), that of
the surface being 0*:1 to 15:2 Cent.*

'The results obtained in another section of the North Atlantic are very different
and of much interest. The observations in Davis Strait and Baffin Bay by Joux Ross
and SABINE indicate that, after passing the point where the diurnal and annual variation
cease, there is a gradual decrease of the temperature with the depth to a point
approaching in places to that of the maximum density of sea-water. Even taking the
readings without correctionf, they show :—

From 1000 to 2000 feet, a temperature of. . . . . . 33 to 29-5 Fann.
