The mitoses
observed in the lamina propria were entirely typical. The cells became swollen with non-
staining cytoplasm, and showed the normal metaphase figure arrested by the action of
colchicine. It should be recorded, however, that this change in the size and appearance of
the cell when in division made it difficult in most cases to be quite certain that the cell
involved was in fact a connective tissue cell and not a wandering lymphocyte. However,
as lymphocytes, once fully formed, were not seen to divide in other localities, such as the
wall of the duodenum where they are common, it was presumed that most, if not all, of
the mitoses observed were in cells belonging to the connective tissue. Counts, of mitoses
were made in unit areas of 0-01 sq.mm.
