In fact, described in strict computational terms,
it is a highly ambiguous, type II problem [41], i.e. a problem
where stimuli must be actively discriminated spatially and
qualitatively using only temporal and proprioceptive cues
(all ‘objects’ found in the virtual space produce the exact
same on-off tactile stimulation). The task set to the partici-
pants is no less complex than typical discrimination tasks. In fact, it is untypically difficult, because the two moving
objects that the participant can encounter (the other partici-
pant’s sensor and shadow) move identically. Distinguishing
them would require, from an individual perspective, not
only a complex strategy for testing socially contingent reac-
tions in these objects but also measuring these reactions in
a highly ambiguous sensory space. The fact that this computationally tough problem can be
resolved with relative ease in the presence of interactive
dynamics does not make this too meager an example of
social cognition.
