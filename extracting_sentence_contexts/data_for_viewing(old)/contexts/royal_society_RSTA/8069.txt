and violent that, in most cases, the details have been lost, and only the extremes
of the excursions have been recorded.

The broad fluctuations are, as already explained, due to the loss of charge, either
positive or negative, by rainfall and the regeneration of charge in the cloud owing to
increased activity. It is interesting to note that, in spite of the rapid removal of charge
by heavy rainfall, the field frequently became positive when the central part of the
cloud was passing overhead and positively charged rain was falling, as it ought to be,
according to the “* breaking-drop ” theory.

Hye observations indicate that a near lightning discharge gives a sudden kick to the
needle of the electrometer, and so confirms the fact that very quick and violent super-
posed oscillations are due to lightning discharges. The quick-run records, which will
be discussed later on, definitely show that these violent movements are due to near
lightning discharges. Some small but sudden movements can also be seen in other
parts of the record, and particularly in the portion LM. These are due to distant
lightning discharges which had originated in a part of the cloud which was not then
overhead.

It will be seen from the subsequent discussion of thunder-lightning intervals that
during the passage of the thunderstorm of September 7 (fig. 3), the lightning discharges
did not originate very near the station. They did not therefore produce any con-
spicuous fluctuations in the electric field ; the minor but very quick fluctuations seen
on the peaks of the electrogram on that date were due to these distant discharges.
