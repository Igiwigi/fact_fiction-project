is strong and decided, the one being + and the other â€”.

In the experiments made from Derby as a central point, the action of the current
is reversed when the earth connection is changed from $S. 15? E. to S. 62? E. I have
tried numerous experiments between these two directions, and there does not appear
to be any line in which all action ceases, but in approaching the S.E. direction the
motion of the needles becomes undefined.

The direction in which the currents travel being supposed to be at right angles to
that in which the reversed action takes place, will be between S. 28* W. and S. 75* W.,
and apparently strongest when the earth connections are about N.E. and S.W.

As the fact above mentioned, namely, that the direction of the current in any wire
at a given time depends on the relative positions of the earth connections, and not
on the direction of the wire itself, is of great interest, I have recently repeated some
of the obseryations on this subject, the results of which are given in diagram No. 3.

In these observations, a spare wire from Derby to Willington, length 64 miles,
bearing S.W., was used as a standard of comparison, and simultaneous obseryations
were made on it, and on a wire from Derby to Rugby, varying the position of one of
the earth connections of the Rugby wire as described below.
