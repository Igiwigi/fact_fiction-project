The only other Carnivores
which have horizontally oval pupils are some of the Herpestes; the other Viverridee
have all vertically oval pupils like all the smaller Felide. The divergence, refraction, and Membrana nictitans are the same as in thé Felidee. In one other respect again the Spotted Ichneumon (Herpestes nepalensis) forms an
exception ; in fact, it has a peculiarity which I have not found in any other Mammal,
which consists in the power of rotating at will either eye outwards. This power of
unilateral excursion, common to certain of the Reptiles, such as the Chameleons,
must be due to a special mechanism of co-ordination, and it would be worth while
investigating whether there is any variation in the optic commissure. 3. Hyenide.—All the Hyzenas, viz., H. striata, H. crocuta (Spotted Hyena), and
H. brunnea (Brown Hyzena), resemble the Felidee and some of the Viverridee, having
the same retinal vascularisation, and the fundus divided into three zones—the peri-
pheral violet, the intermediate green, and the central golden yellow.
