which would cause the obliquity to decrease most rapidly is such that the bodily semi-
diurnal tide would be retarded by about 24 hours.

The former of these two viscogities was the one which I chose for s8nbsequent
numerical application, and for the consideration of secular changes in the system.

Plate 36, fig. 4 (Section 11), shows a similar analysis of the case where there is only
one disturbing satellite, which moves orbitally with one-fifth of the velocity of rotation
of the planet. This case differs from the preceding one in the fact that the position of
zero obliquity is now unstable for all viscosities, and that there is always one other,
and only one other position of equilibrium, and that is a stable one.

This shows that the fact that the earth's obliquity would diminish for large viscosity
is due to the attraction of the sun_ on the lunar tides, and of the moon on the solar
tides.

It is not shown by these figures, but it is the fact that if the motion of the satellite
