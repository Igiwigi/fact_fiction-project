The expansion and
consequent cooling on both sides being the same, the same quantity of water is.
condensed in each half; the quantity available for each drop is thus inversely pro-
portional to the number of drops which are formed. Now the radii of the drops on
the two sides can be compared by measuring the velocity with which they fall; a
comparison of the rates of fall on the two sides will thus enable us to determine the ratio
between the numbers of the drops produced in the two halves of the apparatus, or will
at least serve as a test for equality between the numbers. Professor J. J. Taomson*
has in fact used the rate of fall of the drops, formed on the ions as the result of
expansion, to determine the number of the ions present, from which he obtains an
estimate of the charge carried by each. The results of measurements with this double apparatus are given in the tables
which follow. After what has already been said in connection with the other
apparatus, it is hardly necessary to point out that, when the right-hand plate is
connected to the positive terminal of the battery, and the left-hand plate to the
negative terminal (the central plate being at zero potential), there will be a great
excess of negative ions on the right, and of positive ions on the left.
