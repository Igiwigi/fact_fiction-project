(4.) I now return to the question of expressing the successive quotients of 7! as functions of the differences of the roots and factors: that they must be capable of
being 80 expressed is an obvious consequence of the fact, that the numerators and
denominators of the convergents have been p:t under that form, since if

Ns N;-, N;

D;-y Di-i D;
are any three consecutive convergents of the continued fraction
SO ES PNG ES
Q— Q- Q-
we must have
D;,.N;—N;_.. D;=Q.
It would not, however, be easy to perform the multiplications indicated in the above
equation, 80 as to obtain Q, under its reduced form as a linear fanction of xr. I pro-
ceed'therefore to ſind Q, constructively in the following manner.
