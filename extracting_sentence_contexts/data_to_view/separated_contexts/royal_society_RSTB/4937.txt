Unfortunately, the branches were from
the upper part of a tree old enough, being a garden plant of about ten years of age, to
have some other resin canals in it, and so less valuable for demonstration. However,
the traumatic series and false annual ring arose from the wound area, and extended
for a considerable distance above it. In fact, the photograph was taken from a section
about a centimetre above the peg. : The root has not made so much growth as the branch after the application of the peg,
and so the result is more difficult to represent in a photograph (Photo. 34), since only
a few of the canals have opened up, and there is much parenchyma associated with them. The root, like the branch, was in its second year, but we have only included a small
portion of the tissues because of the necessity of a high power photograph to indicate
the details.
