Elon Musk’s neuroscience start-up Neuralink use
photolithography to produce gold on polyamide ‘threads’ which have diameters between 5 and
50 um with submicron resolution [6]. Despite the advanced nature of research into polymers
and nanofabrication, the niche of nanofabricating on flexible substrates is, in our opinion,
underdeveloped. In this work, the focus will be solely on photolithography rather than other
pattern transfer methods such as electron-beam lithography and nanoimprint lithography for
three reasons: (1) the simplicity of the technique, (2) its wide adoption and (3) the remarkable
fact that the Rayleigh criterion (equation (1.1)) has been overcome to produce single nanometre
features, leading to Moore’s law continuing to apply for half a century [24]. The criterion is the
general limit for the minimum resolvable detail in imaging or the minimum distance D at which
two light spots of wavelength 4 can be resolved
