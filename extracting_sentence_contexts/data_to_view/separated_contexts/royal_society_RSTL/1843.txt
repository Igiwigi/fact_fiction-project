These results, in conjunction with the general law before described,
snggested an experiment of extreme simplicity, which yet, on trial, was found
to answer perfectly. The exclusion of all extraneous cireumstances and all
complexity 'of arrangement, and the distinet character of the indications




TERRESTRIAL MAGNETO-ELECTRIC INDUCTION. 171

afforded, render this single experiment an epitome of nearly all the facts of
magneto-electric induction. 171. A piece of common copper wire, about eight feet long and one twen-
tieth of an inch in thickness, had one of its ends fastened to one of the termi-
nations of the galyanometer wire, and the other end to the other termination ;
thus it formed an endless continuation of the galyanometer wire: it was then
roughly adjusted into the shape of a rectangle, or rather of a loop, the upper
part of which could be carried to and fro over the galvanometer, whilst the
lower part, and the galyanometer attached to it, remained steady (Plate IV.
fig. 30.).
