of Echinoderms, it is only quite recently that any attention has been paid to the
cytology of the hybrids in the early stage of their development.

Purely maternal larvee were described by Sreniger (1894), Morcan (1895),
VERNON (1898), Fiscuen (1906), Hacepoorn (1909), and Tennent (1910). In 1909
KUPELWIESER (48) discovered that it was possible to stimulate the egg of a sea-urchin
to develop by fertilizing it with a sperm of a mollusc, although the male and female
pronuclei never fused. There arose, therefore, the suggestion that the “maternal”
nature of many hybrid larve is, perhaps, due to the same cause, viz., that although
the sperm enters the eggs and causes them to develop, yet only the female pronuclei
are functional in development. Further, it seemed as though the discordant results
of various authors who had worked on the same hybrids might be explained by the
fact that under certain conditions the male pronucleus was functional, while under
other conditions it was not.

In the former case an “intermediate” type of larvee would be expected, and in
the latter only those of the “maternal” type. The fact that we obtained only
“maternal ” larvee from certain crosses during three years’ work led us to investigate
the phenomena of fertilization very carefully. As a result of this work we have
found that in every hybrid with which we have worked a true fusion of the male and
female pronuclei occurs in every egg which develops. A complete cytological study
of eggs taken from the same batches as those from which the hybrids themselves
were reared has shown that there is absolutely no doubt that a true zygote nucleus is
invariably formed. :
