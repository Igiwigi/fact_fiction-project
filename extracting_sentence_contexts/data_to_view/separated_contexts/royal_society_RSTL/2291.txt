the curve is, consequently, a conic section, and the fixed point is one of its foci. The properties of parabolic are included as limiting cases in those of elliptic mo-
tion, and may be deduced from them by making

and therefore the characteristic function w and the time f, in parabolic as well as in
elliptic motion, are functions of the chord and of the sum of the radii. By thus
making a infinite in the foregoing expressions, we find, for parabolic motion, the par-
tial differential equations

provided that, within the extent of these integrations, the radical does not vanish
nor become infinite. When this condition is not satisfied, we may still express the
