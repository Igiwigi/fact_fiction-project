On reducing the temperature the leak
remains small for a time, but then begins to increase rapidly and after a time gets to
about the usual value for a wire in hydrogen, At first, while the leak is increasing
with the time, it falls when the temperature is raised. After further heating
the leak becomes more steady, and then always rises with the temperature. These
facts seem to show that an old wire does not absorb hydrogen above a certain
temperature, or only does so very slowly. The fact that while the leak is rising with time it falls on raising the temperature
is difficult to explain. This effect was obtained on several separate occasions.
