In these plates currents will be developed during the rotation, whose
plane is perpendicular to that of the currents in the wire. The unwished for currents could doubtless have been much diminished by saw cuts
in a vertical plane extending a few inches upwards and downwards from the insulating
layer, but it appeared searcely safe to assume that the ring would retain its shape
under such treatment. It would have been wiser to have tried the effect of spinning
the ring alone before winding on the wire, but we were off our guard from the fact
that the old ring gave no perceptible disturbance. Theory having shown that these currents, if really formed in the manner gupposed,
could be satisfactorily allowed for, we decided to proceed with the experiment. At the
worst, the differential effect between wire circuib closed and wire circuit open could
only be in error by a quantity depending upon the square of the peed, and therefors
capable of elimination upon the evidence of the spinnings themselves; while if the view
were correct that the disturbing currents were principally in a plane perpendicular t0
that of the wire, even the correction for induction would not be much affected.
