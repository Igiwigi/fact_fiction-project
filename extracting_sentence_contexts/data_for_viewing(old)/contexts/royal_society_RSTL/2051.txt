the nervous system, yet in both equally capable of being influenced by it, the
nervous influence being the constant stimulant in the functions of the former
class of muscles, and an occasional stimulant in those of the latter, which in
all their usual functions are excited by stimulants peculiar to themselves ; but
that these classes of muscles are influenced by it in very different ways, each
of the muscles of voluntary motion being under the influence of no part of the
brain and spinal marrow, but the particular part from which its nerves arise ;
while each of the muscles of involuntary motion is under that of eyery part of

* It was thus that HarLen inferred, from finding that the heart cannot, like a muscle of voluntary
motion, be excited through its neryes, that this organ cannot be directly influenced by the brain and
spinal marrow, an error which has more extensively influenced the practice of medicine than any other
into which physiologists have led us. The fact on which this inference is founded depends not on the
heart being placed beyond the direct influence of the brain and spinal marrow, but on the nature of
the ganglionic nerves.
