Slight dissolution,
however, was observed at the end of 3 hours, and marked after 7 hours. These
effects are about the same as those produced by a 1-in-100,000 solution of Cobra
venom under similar conditions. It is evident, then, that the hemolytic action of
Hamadriad venom is very small as compared with that of Cobra venom, being in fact

can have no direct part in producing the fatal effects of Hamadriad poison. ANTIDOTES OF COLUBRINE AND VIPERINE SNAKE VENOMS. 127

Blood Pressure and Respiratory Curves. Tn order to ascertain how death is produced by Hamadriad venom, tracings of the

injected intravenously.
