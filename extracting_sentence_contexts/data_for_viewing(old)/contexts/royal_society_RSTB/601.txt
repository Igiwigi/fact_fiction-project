backwards, and its fibres are seen to be arranged in a distinctly antero-posterior
direction. This direction is continued into the alveus for the first part of its course,
where the fibres are arranged in short lengths at right angles to the cortex, but
posteriorly near the cingulum the fibres appear as points on the convexity of the
cornu Ammonis, 7.Â¢., the part turned towards the ventricle ; but on approaching the
cingulum the fibres are cut obliquely, but for the most part run forwards and back-
wards. Where the fimbria and alveus are in contact with the cornu Ammonis they
send a plexus into its cortex. This is especially the case at the anterior and posterior
parts.

In the section which is on a level with the under surface of the frontal lobe, the
last vestige of which is seen, the cornu Ammonis increases very much in size, owing
to the fact that it is here cut across in a slanting direction as it descends forwards.

The fimbria is much increased in size, and it is turned inwards towards the crus
cerebri, which lies on its inner side, whilst in front is the posterior eut end of the
optic tract. Its most internal fibres are directed backwards and outwards, forming
a thick plexus in the cornu Ammonis, while the rest of them have an antero-posterior
arrangement. The relation of the alveus remains the same as before. When traced
downwards the fimbria remains enlarged, with all its fibres directed inwards and for-
wards until we reach the level of the middle of the optic chiasma, after which the
cornu Ammonis appears enormously enlarged, and then the fimbria suddenly diminishes,
so that in the last section of this series the alveus takes its place and appears as
points, separating the cornu from the hippocampal lobule, as the level is now below
that of the fimbria. .
