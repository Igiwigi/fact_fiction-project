In attempting to account for ocean currents, the real question at issue is: How
far are the suggested causes capable of maintaining currents against the action of
friction? To answer this question an investigation, either mathematical or experi-
mental, as to the effects of friction is essential. Such an investigation I have endeavoured

to supply in another paper,* but mathematical difficulties have compelled me, in
treating of friction, to omit from consideration the important influences due to the
rotation. We have already called attention to the fact that the free steady motions
on a non-rotating globe are far less restricted in character than those on a rotating
globe, while, in that the latter essentially violate what appears to be a necessary
condition when the water is viscous, namely, that there can be no slipping at the
bottom, it seems to me to be probable that even the limited forms of steady motion
here dealt with would be no longer possible if the water were viscous, but that, if
they were started by any means, they would at once give place to periodic motions
of comparatively short period.t This conclusion has been forced on me by the
apparent impossibility of satisfying the equations of motion of a viscous ocean on a
rotating globe by means of slowly declining current-motions. If such should be the
case, it follows that no stable currents can exist without variations in the density of
the water. As however I have not as yet been able to support this view by
anything approaching a rigorous mathematical treatment, the question must for the
