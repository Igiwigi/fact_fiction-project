To highlight the functional implications of the symmetry harmonics, k= 22/4 is the wavenumber, and @9=22/T the
condition embodied in equation (3.1), we write such an angular beat frequency. For the sake of simplicity, we assume
expansion for both the curvature function C(s,t) and the that the wavelength 2 equals the flagellar length ( = L).

half-a-period delayed function C(s, t + T/2): As a note, equations (3.4a—c) can be written in a form

more akin to that used in equation (3.2) by defining:

C(s, t) = co(s) + Seals) cos ee ') +¢,(s) sin ')

| co(s) = Co;
(3.2) c1(s) = Ci sin(ks);
and C1(s) = —Ci cos(ks);
C2(s) = Cz sin(ks + @);
c(st+5) _ C2(s) = —C2 cos(ks + ¢).

n=1 equations (3.4a-c).
(3.3) Equation (3.4b) corresponds to an arched beat waveform and

is asymmetric in space. Equation (3.4c) corresponds to a flagellar
beat that is accelerated (decelerated) when both harmonic com-
ponents have the same (opposite) sign, and despite the fact that
the individual dynamic modes are symmetric, their superposi-
tion is not (figure 2). This occurs because the two modes have

prise a non-zero average curvature (n = 0) or higher curvature different periods (T;=T and T,=T/2). So while individual
