yertical plane, in those cases in which each surface of uniform thrust is also a surface of
uniform vertical pressure; a condition realized im those cases in which the horizontal thrust
is caused by the vertical pressure.

The relation X=F(H) between the horizontal thrust and the vertical pressure, till
remains to be determined by the physical conditions of each particular problem.

Nowve. Equilibrium of Arched Ribs.

Although foreign to the immediate subject, the fact may here be noted, that by
making X=F(H)=0 in equations (27.) and (29.), they furnish the means of deter-
mining the form'of the intrados of any equilibrated arched rib loaded solely with its own
weight, or proportionally to the weight of each of its parts, when the form of the extra-
dos is either represented by equation (28.), or developed by means of the formulze (30.);
care being taken, in the latter case, to include the entire rib within the limits y=+3B.
Tf the rib be divided into youssoirs, their joints ought theoretically to be normal to the
series of curves given by equation (27.) or equation (29.).
