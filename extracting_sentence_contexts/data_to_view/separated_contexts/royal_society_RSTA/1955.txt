This coupling makes radial normal stresses
susceptible to undergoing a saddle-node bifurcation, controlled by the local shear rate d,uz. This possibility can be pursued perturbatively, by considering that the shear stresses t,z in the
UCM base flow are a first-order approximation of the actual shear stresses in the base flow. This
approximation relies on the fact that the UCM velocity profiles are in good agreement with the
velocity profiles experimentally observed at small forcing amplitudes, except at resonances [27]. Following this reasoning, we have found that above a critical value of the forcing amplitude
normal radial stresses diverge in a finite time, and so do all other stress components. Normal

radial stresses are perpendicular to the flow direction and can bend the streamlines, giving rise : =
to the secondary flow observed experimentally [21].
