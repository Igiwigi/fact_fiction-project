E which gives the rotation in minutes in bisulphide of carbon at 18*, corresponding to a

= difference of potential equal to 1 C.G.S. Tt should be noticed that the mean tempera-
ture of the observations was 80 nearly 18* that the result as given depends scarcely
at all upon Brogarz's formula for the dependence of the rotation upon temperature. 22. M. BECQUEREL gives as his reeul for 0* C. +0463 minute, To find the rotation
ab 18?, this musb be multiplied by 9767 according to Bicfat's formula : and as
BrcqQuertLs observations were in fact made ab about 18%, this reduction does not
introduce, but rather removes, an extraneous element. Thus according to BECQUEREL—

x=0452 minute,

differing by about 7 per cent. from the value found by me.
