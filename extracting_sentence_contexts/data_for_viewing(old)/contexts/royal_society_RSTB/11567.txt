Organoids differentiated from induced pluripotent stem
cells (IPSCs) into intestinal epithelial structures are known as
induced intestinal organoids [47]. The differentiation protocols
promoting the generation of such organoids also generates
mesenchyme that, when transplanted under the renal capsule
of mice, differentiate into smooth muscle and myofibroblasts
[24]. These, therefore, are more representative of the intestines
in vivo. However, they require a longer period of time to gen-
erate and are still devoid of immune cells which are necessary
to address the most common intestinal disease IBD.

Other limitations of intestinal organoid include practical
limitations due to the fact that cells must be embedded in
Matrigel™ and grown in 3D. This creates additional compli-
cations when manipulating cells for simple procedures such
as isolating mRNA, DNA and performing immuncytochemis-
try because organoids will require removal from Matrigel™
prior to processing. 3D culture also creates problems
when attempting genetic manipulation via transfection and
CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing approaches. Again, cells require
removal of Matrigel™ prior to manipulation, which can
create suboptimal conditions for organoid maintenance and
growth.

It is clear that intestinal organoids can be used as an effec-
