It is medius not index which
possesses the triple nerve-root supply, though medius is less sentient than index. The skin of the concha is not in Macacus apparently at all specially sentient, yet
its sensory innervation is in part as regards nerve pairs a quadruple one. I am
more inclined to connect the greater overlap in the hand and foot with degree of

‘ Lorze’s “local sign” and with the fact, indicated by the arrangement of the nerve-
fields, that they lie approximately in the region of the lateral line of the animal as
do the nipple and external auditory meatus, a line along which the amount of
overlap seems to be great, perhaps as a heritage trom old ancestral structure. Examined by the degeneration method a somewhat greater degree of overlapping
of root-distribution to the muscles of the limb is evidenced than examination by
