In this way /(v) was deter-
mined for a large number of volumes, and it was found that its values could be
approximately represented by means of the empirical formula

The above formula was selected from a large number that were tried, and it
reproduced the found values of /(v) fairly well, but it is not suggested as being
anything more than an empirical formula, Unfortunately the Kinetic Theory of
Gases is not sufficiently advanced to enable us to form any @ priori notion as to

what form the function f(v) might be expected to have, so that we are perforce
driven to employ an empirical formula. With a large amount of time and labour
it might be possible to find a formula for f(v) simpler in character, and more exact
in its results, but it did not seem worth while to undertake the amount of trouble
involved in such a search, The formula can be successfully used for the purposes of
interpolation within the field of observation, but any use cf it for extrapolation would
be hazardous. We may now write the equation for V* as

V? = 1681 pu — 785,300,000 , 317,700,000 | 3,114,000,000

This formula has been obtained as the result of four consecutive approximations,
and it is possible that each succeeding approximation has led us further from the
facts. On the other hand, it is conceivable that the errors of the various approxi-
mations have to a large extent neutralised one another. It was thought advisable
therefore to test the above formula by calculating out the isothermals, and comparing
them with the observed measurements.
