Comparison of Triplets of Si 111, ALIT, and Mg I.

In accordance with the normal atomic numbers of the three elements a close similarity
between the spectra of Si III, Al II and Mg I is to be expected. All three spectra do,
in fact, include triplet systems in association with singlets. The three atoms in the
states indicated by the symbols have the same number of external electrons, but the
nuclei differ in mass and charge. The effect of mass is so small as to be negligible in
the present discussion, but, as previously explained, the effect of increased nuclear
charge is to displace the spectrum as a whole to the region of short wave-lengths.
