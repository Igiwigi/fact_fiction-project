Second, there is a popular misunderstanding, even among those as well educated as supreme
court justices and many scientists, of the meaning of the word ‘theory’. My goal is not to wade
into the complexity of a philosophy of science definition of ‘theory’, but rather to take on the
common use of the term, as a member of the general public would encounter in a dictionary.
Even in common use, ‘theory’ is like many words in having multiple definitions. The appropriate
definition depends on the context in which it is used. Unabridged dictionaries sometimes present
over 10 definitions for ‘theory’ but I will illustrate the point with the three definitions supplied by
the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language [2]. The second and third definitions
of ‘theory’, those most often used in a colloquial fashion, are: ‘2. Abstract reasoning; speculation.
3. Broadly, hypothesis or supposition’. This is the sense in which Scalia and the proponents of
creation science use the word. To Scalia and others, evolution always carries the epithet of ‘just
a theory’, meaning that it is mere speculation rather than fact. I am reminded of the way Homer
always referred to Greek gods, heroes and peoples with an epithet, such as the grey-eyed Athena
or the horse-taming Trojans. Evolution’s epithet is ‘just a theory’.

The first definition provided by this dictionary is the one that applies to the use of the word
‘theory’ in science:

1. a. Systematically organized knowledge applicable in a relatively wide variety of
circumstances; especially, a system of assumptions, accepted principles, and rules
of procedure devised to analyze, predict, or otherwise explain the nature or behavior of
