Its apparent
resistance to the X* strain of the virus is not likely to be due to protection afforded by a
prior infection with X”, for not only is the variety particularly susceptible to this
strain, but in six of the plants, including the two in which symptoms developed, no
evidence of its presence was found. Whether the existence of the virus of paracrinkle,
always present in King Edward, has any effect, it is not possible to determine, as no
King Edward plant is known in which the latter is absent. It is, however, an interesting
fact that whilst paracrinkle in Arran Victory is a severe disease, paracrinkle when
accompanied by X%, or where induced by a King Edward carrying X” (X*% 14), is
considerably less so. This is discussed later (see p. 203). Apart from the co-existence of the paracrinkle virus, it may be that there is a physical

only when the scions grew vigorously did infection take place.
