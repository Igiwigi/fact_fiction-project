application of Love’s equivalence principle has been proposed in [42], where the concept arises
of a Huygens box embracing a radiative emission source for EMC tests. Only tangential magnetic
fields on the box surface are needed to find the radiated emissions from the source by defining


the equivalent surface current density J, =n x H, with n the outward normal to the surface of the
Huygens box. Then curl equations with the forcing term J, are used to calculate the tangential
components of the electric field. Alternatively to measuring magnetic fields, experimental set-
ups may also measure electric fields. Notable examples are the sleeve dipole used at UMIST [42]
and the atomic field probe recently conceived at NIST [43]. Therefore, defining the coherence
tensor in terms of either electric or magnetic fields allows one to create a model of the source
based on laboratory measurements. Combining electric and magnetic fields, it is also possible,
in principle, to form hybrid magneto-electric CFs. In fact, any combination for which there is an
explicit relation between the resulting coherence tensor and the Poynting vector, which describes
the local direction of the energy flow [44], allows propagation of emissions from the source. We
illustrate this explicitly later in this section, by showing how the coherence tensor can be used
to devise a wave-dynamical phase-space representation from which both the energy flow vector :
and the local energy density can be extracted self-consistently. [=
