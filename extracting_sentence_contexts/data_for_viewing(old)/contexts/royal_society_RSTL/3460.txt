there was seen © only the onter sharp contour of this ring, and in its middle an opake
point ;” in © eytoblasts” still smaller, © only a sharply circumscribed spot ;” in others,
no more than *a remarkable, minute, opake point;” and in the smallest and most
transitory, © it was not to be detected.” He observed the diameter of the nucleolus
to vary © from half that of the cytoblast to points immeasurably small.” Sometimes
the nucleolus appeared to him to he © more opake, at others more pellucid than the
rest of the substance of the cytoblast.”—In connexion with these obseryations of

+ Dr. HzxLs has described the © nucleus” of pus and mucus globules as becoming cleft or divided by acetic
acid into roundish or oval parts, each having a depression in the middle. (VaLzvriN's Repertorium, 1839, IT.
PP- 224, 225.) Compare with the minutest dises in Plate XXII. tig. 162. I think, however, that acetic acid
shows rather the existing state of the object in question ; this being in pus the eccentric nucleolus of a cell.
Besides, the present memoir is full of facts demonstrating that division is a natural mode of reproduction of the
nucleus and nucleolus, and apparently common to these objects everywhere. (All the figures which accom-
Pany this paper represent objects as scen without the addition of any substance whatever. They were viewed
lying either in fluid from the Graafian vesicle, or in mucus from the oviduct.)

ScnrLeIDen, I refer to what has been above stated regarding the changes in appear-
ance presented by the nuclens, from the resolution of its onter portion into cells, and
the continual origin in the interior of the foundations of new cells, and hence the vary-
ing size of the central pellucid cavity (par. 327.) ; believing that the apparent growth
and diminution, and the final * absorption of the nucleus,” supposed by ScnLeipen, as
