c are the general features and phases of a discussion which, though dealing only
a small item of my work, has consumed a considerable amount of time. Other able
imenters have entered this field, the lates} of whom, MM. Lecuer and PerNTER,
published a long and learned memoir in WIEDEMANN's Annalen, which has been
ted in the Philosophical Magazine for January, 1881. My experiments with
they corroborate, but not those with vapours. Regarding the action of aqueous
