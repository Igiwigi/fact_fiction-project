In both we have the facial angle approaching nearly
to a right angle: and the configuration of the vertex and
occiput in each is such, as must attract attention for its ele-
gance, and the indication of a something more important
than mere beauty. It may be affirmed then, that Cuvies's opinion respect-
ing the Caucasian origin of the Egyptians, founded on his
examination of upwards of fifty heads of mummies, is corro-
borated by the preceding observations ; and that the systems
which were founded on the Negro form, are destroyed by
almost all the recent, and certainly the most accurate inves-
tigations of this interesting subject. It is a curious fact, which
has been noticed by more than one traveller, that whole
families are to be found in Upper Egypt, in whom the gene-
ral character of the head and face strongly resembles that of
the best mummies discovered in the hypogei of Thebes :
and not less 80, the human figures represented in the ancient
monuments of that country. Having proceeded thus far in my inquiry into the state of
preservation of the mummy before me, I determined, perfect,
and beautiful as it was, to make it the object of further re-
search by subjecting it to the anatomical knife, and thus to
sacrifice a most complete specimen of the Egyptian art of
embalming, in hopes of eliciting some new facts illustrative
of 80 curious and interesting a subject ; for it is to be observed,
that the deficiency of our knowledge on the art of preparing
mummies by the ancient Egyptians, both as to the mode of

operating, and of the degree of perfection to which that art
was carried among them, has arisen from imperfect and infe-
rior specimens having been generally employed for the pur-
pose of investigation, the best and most perfect mummies
(resembling the one I have undertaken to describe) having,
invariably, been preserved intact; and, in most cases, unco-
vered, as valuable objects of curiosity, in private or public
Museums. A rapid glance at what has been publicly recorded
on this head, will prove the correctness of my assertion.
