It consisted of
vegetative shoots bearing twigs with pectinately arranged leaves; a stouter piece of
stem with about twenty well marked growth rings; male cones in two stages of
development ; and over a dozen megastrobili. At the time of collection, March 10,
1914, the ovules had all reached the stage when they contain young embryos at the
ends of the tortuous suspensor tubes; they had evidently received the last year's
pollen. The fact that most of the male cones collected were nearly mature, suggested
that younger ovules (in a stage shortly before pollination) would also be present, but
there were none such in the material at my disposal. It is hoped that this
unfortunate gap will soon be filled up when more material becomes available. Through the courtesy of the Director I obtained from the Royal Botanic Gardens,
Kew, some material of roots and leaves from two young plants growing in the
Temperate House.
