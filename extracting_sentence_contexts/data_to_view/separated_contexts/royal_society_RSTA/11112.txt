is in descending order, and the theorem of reciprocity involved in the fact of the
existence of the graph consists in the circumstance that the function remains
unaltered, when X,, is put equal to «, for any substitution impressed upon the unsuffixed
symbols /, m, 7
In the corresponding lattice the conditions are :—
(i.) The first, second, &c., rows do not contain more than 1, ”,, &c, numbers
respectively ;

(ii.) The first, second, &c., rows do not contain higher numbers than J,,1,, &e. . . . ;
(iii.) No number so great as s occurs below row m, for all values of s;
