1. Introduction

Our genomes are vastly populated by remnants of viruses and other genomic
elements that have accumulated during mammalian evolution. In fact, in
most common mammals, including mouse, cattle and humans, roughly half
of the genome belongs to this category, commonly referred to as ‘repeats’ or
repetitive elements [1]. Phylogenetically and from the point of view of their
genome structure, repetitive elements can roughly be divided into transposable
elements and satellite DNA. Satellite DNA is typically repeated in tandem at
specific locations across the linear genome and can form clusters of up to sev-
eral kilobases. The satellites forming the centromere of mouse and humans
belong to this class. They are critical to the mitotic process, as they are the
place for kinetochore loading. Their repetitive nature is thought to be important
for the establishment of heterochromatin and consequent physical compaction
of these loci, which is therefore essential for chromosome segregation and faith-
ful chromosome inheritance [2].
