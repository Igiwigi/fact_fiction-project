the selection of DCO-OFDM as the mandatory PHY layer design choice in IEEE 802.15.13 [34].

In the third and last part, we investigated the effect of photodetector location/orientation for a
mobile user. For this purpose, we considered a mobile receiver terminal in the form of a cell phone
with seven possible locations for the photodetector. Five of these are on the top edge and two of
them are on the top round corners of the device. The user holds the phone in his hand next to his
ear with 45° rotation upward. Our results demonstrated that as user moves within the room, the
spatial distributions of channel gain follow sinusoidal-like patterns. When the user approaches
a luminaire, the signal strength increases and the maximum value of channel gain occurs when
the user is right under the luminaire. When the user walks away, the signal strength decreases.
Our results further provide insight on the choice of photodetector location for maximizing the
signal strength. It was particularly observed that the top side of the phone is most favourable as
PD location due to the fact that the channel DC gain is maximized.
