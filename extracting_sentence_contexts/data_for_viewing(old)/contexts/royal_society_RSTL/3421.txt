which had been kept for s0ome months in spirit. The parts being in progress of de-
velopment, seemed to have undergone a partial natural dissection. A mass consisting
of two or three fasciculi was lying in a curved form along the field, and presented on
its convex border transyerse series of beaded segments two or three deep, which, by
the curve given to the part, had lost their longitudinal, bat retained their lateral
adhesion. They therefore stood out in relief, in the manner represented in the
drawing (fig. 10.). Many segments of these outermost fibrille are completely de-
tached.

From what has now been advanced, it is clear that the idea of the composition of
the fasciculi by fibrille: requires considerable qualification. They split up, indeed, in
general into fibrillze, but in other cases their natural cleavage is into discs, and in all
instances these discs exist quite as unequivocally as the fibrillze themselves. In fact,
the primitive fasciculus seems to consist of primitive component segments or particles,
arranged $0 as to form, in one sense, fibrillze, and in another sense, discs; and which
of these two may happen to present themselves to the observer, will depend on the
amount of adhesion, endways or sideways, existing between the segments. Generally,
in a recent fasciculus, there are transverse $triz, showing divisions into discs, and
longitudinal striz, marking its composition by fibrillzee. The reason why the trans-
verse striz are ordinarily 80 much more decided, is that the fibrillee are more close
together than the discs, and their shaded interspaces consequently narrower. The
adhesion of the segments to one another is, in neither direction, fixed and rigid, but
of a kind admitting, as will be afterwards seen, of those minute changes of position,
which occur during the active state of the organ. The diyersity now observed be-
tween the longitudinal and transverse union of the segments, may bear reference to
