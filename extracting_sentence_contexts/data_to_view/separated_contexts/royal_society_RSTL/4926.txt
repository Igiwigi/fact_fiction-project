In the Bryozoa and Pycnogonidz the vital fluids are constituted in the organism into
a system, in s8trict accordance with the chylaqueous. How perfectly these two
instances prove that nature, in cases of simple organisms, gathers together and circu-
lates the nntritive fluids on the type and plan of this system, and not on that of the
true-blood ! This fact indicates in the former, with respect to the latter, a relation of
inferiority. In both the instances enumerated, the fluids notwithstanding exhibit an
advance upon the true chylaqueous fluid, in the fact that the corpuscles are more
highly organized, while the fluid itself is more perfectly fibrinized, indications both
of a higher degree of vitalization,

In the Tunicata the apparatus of the circulation is developed obviously above the
standard of the former. A heart and arterial trunks are detectable.
