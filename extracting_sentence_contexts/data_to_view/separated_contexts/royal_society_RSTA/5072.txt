In
cases, at all events, this is due to a real variation in thickness. The results given above are sufficient proof of the apparent variability o
thickness of the film. The best proof that this variability is sometimes real, is the fact that we |
distinctly seen two different shades of black in the same film. NerwTon recog’
two different intensities of black in soap bubbles, and Lord Kenvin has on more |
one occasion asked us whether we have noticed the same phenomenon. So
our experiments were made with a solution containing a relatively large proporti

films containing no salt the phenomenon is of frequent occurrence.
