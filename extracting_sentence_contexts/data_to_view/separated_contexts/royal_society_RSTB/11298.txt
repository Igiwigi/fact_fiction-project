ing suggests that currently identified genetic loci do not appear
to influence the initial (newborn) setting of telomere length, but . a .
that they may play a role in telomere length modification (b) Determinants of the initial setting of the telomere
during the life course [136]. Collectively, these observations, biology system

in conjunction with the understanding that heritability may
overestimate genetic effects (because it includes maternal
intrauterine effects), emphasize a major role for maternal and
intrauterine effects in the initial setting of TL. In fact, as under-
scored recently by Dugdale & Richardson [137], accurate and
meaningful measures of the heritability of telomere length can
be derived only after fully understanding and accounting for
the nature and timing of environmental effects. Furthermore,
experimental and observational studies in animals and
humans (discussed below in §§5b and 5c) suggest adverse
intrauterine conditions such as stress, poor diet/nutrition and
obstetric complications are associated with shorter offspring
TL or reduced telomerase activity at birth and/or in childhood
and adult life [4,138], thereby providing biological plausibility
for the fetal /developmental programming hypothesis. Human and animal studies support the concept that the initial
setting of the telomere system exhibits developmental plas-
ticity and is influenced by various physiological, social,
environmental and clinical conditions in early life.
