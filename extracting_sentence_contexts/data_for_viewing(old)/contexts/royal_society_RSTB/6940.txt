“‘prevomer”; Vo., ““vomer” of Broom.

the Theriodont parasphenoid in that it does not extend below the basisphenoid
posteriorly, and from the Theriodont prevomers in extending as far back as the
basisphenoid. Unfortunately, the specimens are not very well preserved and their
structures are difficult to determine. But assuming that the bone is a membrane bone,
and is as figured by Broom, there is still no evidence that it is the parasphenoid which
has migrated anteriorly rather than the prevomers which have continued their already
well-established backward growth. To call the bone parasphenoid is to beg the whole
question. But there is an even greater objection to this interpretation. When later
(1935) Broom published a section of the skull, the position of the critical sutures of
this bone are quite different (figure 8c). Here the parasphenoid is shown underlying
the basisphenoid, and not extending so far forward as in the earlier figure. In fact,
the section is an entirely hypothetical one, as is indicated by the dotting of the lines,
and does not supply the critical evidence of the forward migration of the parasphenoid.


ON THE EVOLUTION OF THE MAMMALIAN PALATE 317

Broom’s drawing of the palate suggests a different interpretation. The animal is a
small one, and if, as might be expected from its advanced skeletal structures, the
brain has become larger than that of its more primitive ancestors, then the “pre-
sphenoid” would have had to move down to provide the necessary accommodation.
This would bring it in contact with the front of the basisphenoid (a position which
it must reach sooner or later) and the hind end of the fused prevomers, resulting in
