It was evidently an exceptionally dark form for this series. The others were exposed for probably the whole of Stage III. and were much affected,
one of them being brighter than any of the transferred pupz in Division B. The
latter result must be also partially due to the fact that the larvee had been previously
exposed to surroundings which were far less dark than those made use of in B. D. Another experiment was made upon six mature larve, which were placed,
August 31, 2.30 P.M., in a small cylinder resembling those described in Series V., B.,
covered with two layers of black tissue-paper, but lined with gilt paper.
