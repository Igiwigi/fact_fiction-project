On 4 June 1889, Dmitri Mendeleev delivered the Faraday Lecture before the Fellows of the Dh
Chemical Society of Great Britain; his lecture was entitled The Periodic Law of the Chemical Elements, :o

...While science is pursuing a steady onward movement, it is convenient from time to :3
time to cast a glance back on the route already traversed, and especially to consider the new
conceptions which aim at discovering the general meaning of the stock of facts accumulated
from day to day in our laboratories.

In that spirit, the present contribution is an attempt to look back and review our understanding
of the development of the periodic system of the chemical elements, with a particular emphasis on
the question as to why the chemical elements exist either as metals or non-metals under ambient
conditions on Earth. In his 1905 treatise, ‘The Principles of Chemistry’ [2] Mendeleev set out one
of the early—but recurring—challenges of attempting to define metals and non-metals in the
periodic table.

Many elements, although not all of them, have the peculiar lustre, opacity, malleability, and
the high thermal and electrical conductivities peculiar to the metals. ... But elements are
far from all being metals. Those which do not possess the physical properties of metals
