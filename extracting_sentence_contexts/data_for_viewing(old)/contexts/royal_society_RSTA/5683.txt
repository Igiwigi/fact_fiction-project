Pri probability of non-key index / at location / distributing an HIVST kit to an alter of type a : =
fe economic benefit of distributing an HIVST kit to an alter of type a : =
Sky the number of MSM social network neighbours including stable sexual partners, casual sexual partners and 18
other MSM community friends of key influential index k at location /

variables
Xgl the number of HIVST kits allocating to key influential index k at location /
Xi the number of HIVST kits allocating to non-key index / at location /

So does the item [Prinz J. The adoption of Gaussian greatest integer function here is also due
to the fact that we need to ensure the output number of each type of alters is also an integer. Then
we introduce constraints.

Subject to: constraints of integer decision variables, of limited resources settings, of upper or
lower bound of kitsâ€™ number for each index can distribute, and of location consideration
