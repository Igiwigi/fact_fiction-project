In fact we hav
reason to suppose that the branching was normal, not adventitious, and that the lar
shoots arose, like the normal branches of Hquisetum or any other vascular plan i
the immediate neighbourhood of the growing point. The secondary wood
the base of the branch is imbedded, was evidently deposited after the branch
formed ; the stem and branch together became invested simultaneously by a com
woody zone. In fact the conditions in Calamites are the same as in the brane
any stem with secondary growth in thickness, and present no special difficulties
that the facts are known. The successive changes in structure which we find in a branch, as we trace ii
its base upwards, have already been described. The changes consist essentially
rapid increase in the diameter of the pith, and in the number of vascular b
surrounding it.
