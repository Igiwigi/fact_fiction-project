So careful are they to fill
the cavity to its very 'summit, that when from their increase
of growth the apex of the shell is vacated in consequence of
its straightness, either that part is removed by the animal, and
additional calcareous matter is secreted to close the aperture
thus formed, or it is permitted to remain, and the cavity is
filled up by the same secretion; of the former process' we
have an instance in Bulimus decollata ; and of the latter many
instances occur, familiar to the knowledge of conchologists. The Ocytho# offers to our consideration a remote deviation
from these ordinary laws which apply to the testaceous
mollusca, inasmuch as it only resides in the last vulution-or
body of the shell. In the specimen above described, the
sides of the abdomen are slightly canaliculated, in conformity
with the sculpture of the inner lateral surface of the shell;
but it is worthy of remark, that the portion which corresponds
with the most unequal part of the chamber, the carina, is not
at all indented ; which fact induces the supposition that the
shell'does not fit the body, and of course was not'made' for
it, otherwise it does not seem probable that the body would

be remote from the shell in one part, and impressed by its
asperities in another. Such also is the form of the inferior part of the abdomen,
that it never could have revolved in the cavity of the invo-
luted spire; yet we have never been informed that the vacated
Spire has been either broken or solidified.
