Whether the appearance of one or other of
these phenomena is dependent upon the different rate of development of the two
states under different conditions, and the consequent predominance of one or other
sum of effects under the influence of a given series of induction shocks, is a question
into which I cannot now enter. The simple and obvious statement in terms of
Herinc’s theory (negative variation a sign of dissimilation, positive variation a sign
of assimilation) is extremely convenient as a description, but is not finally justified
until we are more fully acquainted with the electrolytic changes occurring in the
polarisation of living nerve. And although I shall tentatively describe certain facts
n terms of that theory, it can only be with the express reservation that the physico-
chemical mechanism of anodic and kathodie polarisation may or may not prove to
harmonize with such a mode of description. Yet, whether the theory fits the facts
or not—whether, e.g., the positive variation be or be not a token of integrative

by means of anesthetics; they are presumably closely related phenomena of which the electrolytic
polarisability of nerve is the common condition, the former requiring a nerve of greater instability than
the latter. Tn order to escape as far as possible from ambiguity in the use of the terms, the initial letters A. and
K. are occasionally (¢.g., on p. 64) used to denote fugitive electrotonus, while the full words anelectro-
tonus and katelectrotonus are used only to designate permanent electrotonus (¢.g., on p. 58).
