Dogs in whom the inferior cerebellar peduncle was divided on one side gave evidence
of most marked departure from this normal standard. For a variable time after the
operation, usually about a week, the animal takes no notice of the clip when it is
placed on any of the extremities, and that not only when the skin alone is pinched
up, but when the clip is firmly pressed against the periosteum of some bone. The
limb in which sensibility to painful impressions usually returns first is the anterior
extremity of the side opposite to that of the lesion. There appear to be few
exceptions to this rule in uncomplicated cases. The posterior extremity on the side
of the lesion, on the other hand, is, as a rule, the last to recover ; but it is less easy
to speak definitely with regard to the order of restoration of sensibility to painful
impressions in the other extremities; sometimes the posterior extremity of the
opposite side, at other times the anterior extremity on the side of the lesion, is the
second to recover. But in spite of this fact of the posterior extremity on the side
of the lesion being last to recover when sensibility to painful impressions returns
in all the extremities, the animal may appear to be more sensitive to painful
impressions on the posterior extremity of the side of the lesion than on the opposite
side.

When sensibility to painful impressions is first returning the animal only takes
notice of the clip when it is pressed firmly against the periosteum of some bone ; but,
as further improvement occurs, the pinching up of the skin alone is objected to, and
in the end they respond to the stimulus in the same way that normal dogs do.
There is always return of sensibility to painful impressions before the improvement
in motility is sufficient to allow the animal to stand or walk.
