Since in the direction of their strike
they do neither of these things, from Oxford to the coast of Dorset, a distance of about
100 miles, we need look for the shore line in only two directions, at right angles to the
strike. CORALLIAN ROCKS OF OXFORD, ETC. 161

Borings at Ware, Slough, Winkfield, and many points in and round London, have
revealed that the Corallian disappears in a 8.E. direction [15, ete.]. In fact it is well
established that throughout Jurassic times, except for a temporary transgression
during the Great Oolite, a land-mass existed to the 8.E. of a line not many miles
removed from the present escarpment of the Chalk. This land-mass has received a great deal of attention in the past, and it was roughly
mapped as early as 1856 by Gopwry-AustEN, who supposed it to have extended over the
North Sea and the Scandinavian region throughout the Jurassic Period [12, p. 46]. It
received the most detailed study.in 1913 by Sir AuBREy SrRAHAN, who, on the evidence
of deep borings, constructed a contoured map of the Paleozoic platform as it appeared
before being affected by post-Cretaceous folding. ‘The author of this map then remarked
that “One of the results of the elimination of post-Oligocene movements has been to
accentuate the importance of the elevated tract of Kastern England at the expense of
the Palswozoic areas of Western England and Wales ” [40].
