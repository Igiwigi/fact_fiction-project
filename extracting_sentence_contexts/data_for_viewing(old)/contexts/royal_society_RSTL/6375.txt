MR. C. V. WALKER ON MAGNETIC STORMS AND EARTH-CURRENTS, 101

general character of earth-currents; and of these I should be somewhat disposed to think
that the obseryations made on September 7 are the most characteristic. Be this as it
may, it comes out, from what we have recorded, that there is little difference of behaviour
between the two kinds of currents. The S. currents, for instance, differ but little either
in degree or in duration from the N. currents.
1t is not my purpose in this communication to set forth any theory as to the origin
of the currents in question ; neither is it my object to discnss the auroral theories. But
there is a certain feature in M. Dg La Rrve's theory which fails in the presence of the
facts before us, and which requires notice here from the confidence with which it is put
forth. On the faith of a few observations made on the Berne—Zurich telegraph line
between 8 and 9h a.x. on September 2, 1859, this philosopher arrives at the conclusion
Q that the N, currents have a longer duration and are more powerful than the S. currents,
© and that the latter are merely due to the secondary polarities acquired by the earth-
Z plates when they have transmitted a derived N. current. He calls the N. the direct
& current; and he 8ays, © Nous pouyons done conclure de Ja, d'abord que le courant
