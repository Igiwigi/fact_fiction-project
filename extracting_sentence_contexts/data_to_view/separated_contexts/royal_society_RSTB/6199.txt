J. BERRILL ON STUDIES IN TUNICATE DEVELOPMENT

polystyelids such as Symplegma and Botryllus, the vessels are numerous and scattered
so that the test envelops the whole colony. In contrast with the above the confinement of the zooids of synoicids such as
Aplidium or Morchellium within a common test is due not to the presence of inter-
vening stolonic vessels, which are very poorly developed, but to the fact that the
zooids all develop very close together and simultaneously secrete tunicin. Minor variations in the spacial arrangement of the zooids or in the distribution
of the vessels may accordingly result in marked changes in the general appearance
of a colony. Not only is the form of a colony greatly influenced by the nature of its constituent
zooids, but also in many cases the zooids themselves have obviously been influenced
by colonial requirements.
