The two-dimensional harmonic oscillator is separable in Cartesian coordinates, as the quantum
Hamiltonian H = 1eP+A) ) commutes with the Hamiltonian in x, Ay = 3(P2 + @). Therefore,
there are eigenfunctions of H which factorize into functions of x and y (each one-dimensional
harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions), and of course these are the HG modes, for which (with our :
choice of dimensionless constants) AyHGin = (m+ )HGnin, AyHGin =(n+ 3)HGnn. Thus, [=

AG = (Ay + Ay)HG pm = (1 +11 + 1G = (N + HG, 3

so the mode order N corresponds to the quantum harmonic oscillator’s principal quantum ae
number, and the quantum energy eigenvalue N +1 is related to the total Gouy phase on fo
propagation [8]. :4

In fact, we can consider the operator analogue of the classical quantity M, Dy

M=Ay - Ay=}@2+% - 7, -%)- By is

The commutator [M, A] =0 (as we could have anticipated from the Poisson brackets of the
classical observables), and so there is a mode set of simultaneous eigenfunctions of Mand H—
this is the HG modes. In fact, MHGmnn = (im — n)HGnn: the spectrum of yM consists of integers
—N,-—-N + 2,...,N; this ladder spectrum resembles that of an angular momentum operator (with
an extra factor of 2), originating from isomorphism of the underlying su(2) Poisson algebras. Here
Mis the difference of two Hamiltonians, distinguishing a set of Cartesian axes (up to a rotation
by 180°), but no sense of linear or angular momentum associated with it.
