Sleft ventricle (7); and thirdly, such as belong partly to the one ventricle and partly to
Zthe other (Plate XV. fig. 50, e). Thus, in dissecting the septum from. the right ide,
= Sthe fibres first met with belong almost exclusively to the right ventricle. These fibres,
Zif traced from below upwards like the other internal fibres of the right ventricle, proceed
= from right to left. Traced from above downwards, their direction is just the reverse, or
2 from left to right; and it is important to note this circumstance, as the internal fibres
Zof the right ventricle become mixed up on the septum, at no great depth from its swr-
S face, with fibres belonging exclusively to the left ventricle*, the direction of which is
Sako from left to right downwards. There is therefore a portion of the septum in
Awhich the internal fibres of the right ventricle are mingled with the external fibres of
the left, and where the two sets pass through each other as the fingers of the one hand
might be passed between those of the other. The fibres found till deeper, and which
m fact constitute the left two-thirds of the septum, belong exclusively to the left
ventricle. These points may be readily established by dissection.

External layers of the right and left ventricles (Mammal).

Superficial or first external layer. Tf the ventricles are dissected together (Plate XIIL.
figs. 18 & 20), the fibres of the superficial or first external layer posteriorly (Plate XIII.

* The existence of these fibres in the right third of the septum induced me, when deseribing the left
ventricle, to regard the septum as forming a part of its walls.
