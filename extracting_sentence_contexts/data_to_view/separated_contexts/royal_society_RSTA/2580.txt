Since frogs have an area-
based adhesive system (the toe pads), it is unsurprising that larger (and hence heavier) species
fall from the platform at lower angles. From this information, the force per unit area of these
toe pads can be calculated (figure 11d). The positive slope of the line of best fit, though small, is
statistically significant (r = 0.68; d.f. = 11; p < 0.05), and reflects the fact that larger tree frogs have
more efficient toe pads. A similar study, but looking at the effects of growth on adhesion of these
same species [43], shows similar effects, toe pads becoming more structurally complex as the frogs
grow. Close examination of the behaviour of tree frogs during such tilting experiments [42,44]
demonstrates that tree frogs have evolved special strategies to maintain adhesion on overhanging
surfaces.
