The observations of
Brace and others have shown that, just before the electrified particle loses its
kinetic energy, there is a rapid increase in its power of ionisation. A limit to this
increase is attained some little time before the power of ionisation ceases. The
curve depicting these facts is well known. Its definition, as determined by
GeicEr,* is used in the applications of it which I make in what follows. We seem, then, entitled to expect that a halo would show features in general
accordance with the following scheme of development.
