nothing in the Laboratory is being moved, and when there is no traffic in the road. They are always bad on a windy day; but this may possibly be attributed to small
changes of barometric pressure occurring from wind pressure. We are placed at
about 150 yards from a road along which a steam tram runs, and every time a tram
comes past, the needle moves about violently ; in fact, we often obtain the first
indication of the approach of a tram from the motion of the needle. All these draw-
backs can only be eliminated by increasing the efficiency of the magnetic screen, and
this is therefore the next step to take. Method of Observation.â€”In order to obtain the maximum reading for a given
Ghrrent, we always obtain a double deflexion, and read the first elongation of the
eedle.
