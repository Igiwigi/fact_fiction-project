MR. ABEL'S RESEARCHES ON GUN-COTTON. 203

The following are the principal facts demonstrated by the foregoing experiments :â€”

1. The results furnished by the samples of Waltham Abbey gun-cotton demonstrate
that different samples of the material, manufactured as far as possible in the same
manner, are not alike affected by exposure for a fixed period to 100 C. under uniform
conditions. Of thirteen samples of Waltham Abbey gun-cotton, four resisted in a
remarkable manner the destructive effects of heat, and remained unchanged in physical
properties and explosivencss after thirty hours' exposure to 1009 C, This treatment, only
developed acid to a slight extent in these particular samples ; but in the other nine spe-
cimens it produced somewhat greater alteration ; nitrous acid was disengaged in more
considerable proportions, the fibre of the gun-cotton was rendered more or less rotten,
Aid its explosiveness was diminished in different degrees.
