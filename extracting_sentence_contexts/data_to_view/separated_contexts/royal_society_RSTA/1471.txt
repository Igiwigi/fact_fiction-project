It is possible to effect this adjustment—in a certain
measure—by the addition of simple elements to each such function ; but the process
becomes unduly complex, and needs no detailed illustration. A considerably more convenient, if less stringent, procedure, is to proceed with the
summation of the functions g in the manner prescribed, and to adjust, as completely
as possible, the behaviour of the final result by the inclusion of appropriate terms. A solution conducted on the latter basis has, in point of fact, the advantage that it
may cover a somewhat wider problem than would otherwise be embraced. In order
to complete the solution for the general case of rotation this second treatment will be
adopted. It appears that all conditions, such as may legitimately be imposed at infinity, can
be satisfied by incorporating in the solution a simple “ adjusting’ function of the
following type :

¥’ = — Ala, sinh (20 — K)
