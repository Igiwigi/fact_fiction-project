We also provide a Docker image in
the test repository, which implements all tests in all sub-projects
without the need for local installation of ScilInit, NEURON and
the NeuroML tool chain. Analogous to an image on a virtual
machine, a Docker image (http:// www.docker.com) is a compart-
mentalized operating system which is frozen in a pre-configured

curation and automated tools, yielding curated databases of
empirical observations (from experiments on the biological
worm) and structured, machine-readable models at several
scales. Summaries of observations are extracted from these
databases, representing stylized facts about experiments. Models are simulated to produce corresponding predictions,

state. Docker removes a large technical burden from the user by and these predictions are compared with observations to
shifting package management complexity from users to develo- yield test scores.
