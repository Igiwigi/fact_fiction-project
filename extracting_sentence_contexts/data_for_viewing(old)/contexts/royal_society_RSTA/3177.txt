(b) Schwinger algebras and Heisenberg indeterminacy principle

In the classical case there can be at most one maximal partition of the identity, and conversely if
this is the case, then the measurement algebra is classical in the sense of the previous definition.

In this section, we formulate in terms of measurements the fundamental new qualitative
feature of quantum physics, i.e. the Heisenberg principle. As stated in the introduction, we
want to formulate this principle as a general information-theoretic statement, whose application
should not be restricted to the domain of micro-physics. More specifically, we individuate the
qualitative essence of the Heisenberg principle in the mere statement of existence of incompatible
observables. In the language of measurement algebras this means that a non-trivial quantum
situation is characterized by the fact that it admits at least two different maximal partitions of the
identity.

(A8) Heisenberg indeterminacy principle (weak form). There exist two different maximal
partitions of the identity (Aq) and (Bg).

Definition 3.3. A Schwinger algebra of rank n over a set T is a triple
{A,T, (A@))xer}, (3.8)

where A is a real associative *-algebra, T is a set and, for every x in T, A(x) := {A,(x),...,An(x)} is
a maximal partition of the identity in A such that, for any x,y in T, for any j,k =1,...,n and for
any y â‚¬x, the following conditions hold:
