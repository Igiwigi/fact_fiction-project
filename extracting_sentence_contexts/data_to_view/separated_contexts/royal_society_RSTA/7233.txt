It is apparent, therefore, that if the transformation takes place according to the
Nishiyama mechanism the nuclear crystal will be forced, except possibly at low tempera-
tures, to take up some position in which 4 lies between 0° and 5°-3. Alternatively, if the
Kurdjumow-Sachs mechanism were operative, the values of ~ would probably be
slightly greater and slightly less than 5°-3. The fact that only one crystal was observed in
Canon Diablo for which this value was exceeded is difficult to explain on the Kurd-
jumow-Sachs theory; while the fact that orientations of type II have actually been
observed in artificial alloys transformed at low temperatures is strong evidence in favour
of the Nishiyama theory. KKAMACITE ORIENTATIONS IN THE TESSERAL OCTAHEDRITES

Of considerable interest in connexion with orientations of type I are the tesseral
octahedrites found in the Bethany (Gibeon) iron and described by Rinne (1910). In these meteorites there exist, in addition to the usual octahedral lamellae, lamellae
parallel to the planes of the cube.
