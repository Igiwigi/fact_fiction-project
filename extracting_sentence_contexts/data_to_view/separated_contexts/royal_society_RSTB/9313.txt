It is important to note that this definition refers to criminal investigations
because the application of the forensic sciences extends beyond the court
environment to adding focus to investigations and to the development and pro-
vision of intelligence. Therefore, a full discussion on forensic science research
and innovation should have a broader focus than the courts. Research: The systematic investigation into the study of materials and sources
in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions (www.google.com.au/
#=definition+for+ research (accessed 6 December 2014)). Synonyms included in
this definition are investigation, experimentation, testing, exploration, analysis,
scrutiny and probing. Innovation: Make changes in something established, especially by introducing
new methods, ideas or products (www.google.com.au/#=definition+for+inno-
vation (accessed 6 December 2014)).
