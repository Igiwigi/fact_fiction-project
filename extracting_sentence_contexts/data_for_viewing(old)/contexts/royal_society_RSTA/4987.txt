In fact, for G given as above, we have

(Fu, $) < [] mults,(Std?"),

where mult,,(Std?"") denotes the multiplicity of A; in Std?”

If F is strictly U-generous, then equality holds in this formula, and in particular the left-hand side is
non-zero if and only if is of the form @&); Ai(F;) with A; as above.

In general, if § is of the form (2.2), then there exists a character x of G/G° such that

(Fn, G @ x) 0.
