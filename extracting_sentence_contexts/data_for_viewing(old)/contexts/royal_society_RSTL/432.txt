manner solid bodies and non-elastic fluids permit it to pass
through them, may enable us to account for its warmth under
certain circumstances, yet the bare admission..of this principle
does not seem to be sufficient to account for the very extraordi-
nary degrees of warmth which we find in furs and in feathers,
and in various other kinds of natural and artificial clothing ; nor
even that which we find in snow ; for if we suppose the par-
ticles of air to be at liberty to carry off the heat which these
bodies are meant to confine, without any other obstruction or
hinderance than that arising from their vis inertic, or the force
necessary to put them in motion, it seems probable that the suc-
cession of fresh particles of cold air, and the consequent loss of
heat, would be much more rapid than we find it to be in fact.

That an attraction, and a very strong one, actually subsists
between the particles of air, and the fine hair or furs of beasts,
the feathers of birds, wool, &c. appears by the obstinacy with
which these substances retain the air which adheres to them,
even when immersed in water, and put under the receiver of
an air-pump; and that this attraction is essential to the
warmth of these bodies, I think is very easy to be demon-
strated.
