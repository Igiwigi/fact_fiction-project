of four points; and the points of the harmonic pair are aid to be the (double or) s1bi-
conjugate points of the involution. A system of three or more pairs, such that the
third and every subsequent pair are each of them harmonically related to the sibi-
conjugate points of the first and second pairs, is said to be a system in involution. In
particular, for three pairs we have what is termed an involution of six points; and it is
clear that when two pairs and a point of the third pair are given, the remaining point of
the third pair can be determined. And in like manner for a greater number of pairs,
when two pairs and a point of each of the other pairs are given, the remaining point of
each of the other pairs can be determined. Two points of the same pair are said to be
conjugate to each other; or if we consider two pairs as given, then the points of the
