The resistivity 1/p is introduced into the
A calculations for purely mathematical reasons, on account of certain analytical
advantages which it seems to offer. The results obtained in this way, in terms of
the coefficients of p, might be got otherwise by an extension of the method used by
Scuuster. This identity of results is clear from the fact that if the Fourrer
coefficients of p are small enough the Taytor’s series for 1/p is absolutely convergent,
and the legitimacy of the use of 1/p is in this case immediately evident; the formal
results, however, do not depend on any property of convergence, so that the results
obtained by using 1/p remain equally valid with those obtained in any other way,
even though the series for 1/p should become non-convergent. ‘This is one of many
instances in which it is possible and advantageous to use expressions which may
