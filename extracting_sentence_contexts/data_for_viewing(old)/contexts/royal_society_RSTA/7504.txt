pf’ = K, /{2m(W—W')}+K, /(2MW’),

where the numerical constants K, and K, take account of the energy lost by turbulence, and
of the new distribution of momentum with direction. It will be assumed that neither of
these constants will be much greater than K.

At Heligoland, the main crater must have extended almost to sea-level, although the
bottom is now filled with about 15 m. ofrubble. The original plateau was about 50m. above
sea-level, and the diameter of the crater is about 100m. Thus the volume is about 1-3 x
10" cm.3, making M = 3x 10!'g.

An upper limit to the velocity imparted to the rock can be obtained from the fact that
nearly all of it fell within 100 m. of the centre of the crater, and the lower limit from the fact
that a large amount was able to clear the rim. Taking 50m. as an estimate of the average
height attained gives W’ = 1-5 x 10!8 ergs.

The total thermal energy in the main charge group was about 1:3 x 107° ergs, or roughly
100 times that required to produce the crater. Under the most favourable circumstances
W would be about 30 % of the thermal energy. The mass m is equal to that of the explosive,
together with the mass of the air which is accelerated during burning. The air within a radius
of 60m. would weigh as much as the explosive, so that the contribution from this source
would become important if the burning time were to exceed a few hundredths of a second.

Thus we have W'/W=1/30, M/m<100,
giving pb’ <K,,/(2m x 29/30W) + K,,/(2 x 100m x W/30) = 2K /(2mW).
