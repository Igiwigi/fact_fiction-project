It will be seen that the first
effect of the oxygen was to prolong the succeeding period of apncea, but that at least
one other period of breathing, and subsequent apnoea, followed before the breathing
became regular. It might, perhaps, have been expected that the oxygen would simply
produce a long apnoea, followed by regular breathing. This would doubtless have
been the case if the oxygen inspired at first had been sufficient to raise the alveolar
oxygen pressure higher; but as a matter of fact it would take a number of breaths
thoroughly to wash out the alveoli with oxygen, and the first two or three breaths
would only raise the oxygen pressure sufficiently to prolong the subsequent apncea. The numerous analyses of alveolar air by Doueias and by Dotveias and Hanpane,
after taking in a breath or two of oxygen, illustrate this point. Similarly, it took a
considerable time after the breathing of air was re-established before the periodic
breathing returned.
