The verification of the equations for viscous fluids under snch extreme cireum-
stances affords a severe test of the truth and completeness of the assumptions on
which these equations were founded. While the result of the whole research is to
point to a conelusion (important in Natural Philosophy) that not only in cages of
intentional lubrication, but wherever hard surfaces under pressure slide over each
other without abrasion, they are separated by a film of some foreign matter whether
perceivable or not. And that the question as to whether this action can be con-
tinnous or nob turns on whether the action tends to preserve the matter between the
surfaces at the points of pressure as in the apparently unique case of the revolving
journal, or tends to s8weep it to one side as is the resnlt of all backwards and forward
rubbing with continuous pressure,

The fact that a little grease will enable almost any surfaces to slide for a time has
tended doubtless to obscure the action of the revolving journal to maintain the oil
between the surfaces at the point of pressure. And yet, although only now under-
8to0d, it is this action that has alone rendered our machines, and even our carriages
possible. The only other self-acting system of lubrication is that of reciprocating
Joints with alternate pressure on and separation (drawing the oil back or a fresh
supply) of the surfaces.
