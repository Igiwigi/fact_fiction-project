ORBAN and MUELLER made graphic recon-
structions of the base of the enamel organs to show the outline of Hertwig’s sheath and
the outline of the opening bounded by it; they called the latter the “‘basale Offnung

des Keimes’’. Using the same method I have made graphic reconstructions of the basal openings
of the enamel organs of teeth “‘x” and “‘y” of the lower jaw of Ornithorhynchus at two

stages of development, namely, in pack H.P. and H.X.
The enormous complication of the root plan in the later stages of development is
obvious from these diagrams (fig. 14). In fact, I have had to leave out several of the

more minute openings, since in one or two places they become so numerous and lie so
close together as to give the appearance of a finely fenestrated membrane to the
epithelial sheath. In both teeth there is apparently a tendency to retain a single large
opening into the pulp cavity at the posterior end of the teeth, this opening extending
over most of the transverse diameter of the base of the tooth. Over the rest of the
tooth, however, the growth and fusion of various parts of the epithelial sheath results
in the basal opening of the enamel organ (which is still relatively simple in tooth “y”
of H.P.) being cut up into a large number of smaller openings.
