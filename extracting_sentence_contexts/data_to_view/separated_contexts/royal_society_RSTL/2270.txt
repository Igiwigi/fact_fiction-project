In the whole range of comparative anatomy in which
separate organs are developed for the three essential purposes
of animal life, sensation, digestion, and propagation of the
species, those organs in the oyster are the smallest, the most
simple, and have the least to occupy them. Their mode of
propagation will be found even more simple than it is in many
plants, and the processes that are gone through, are carried
on in a much shorter time. ; ,

entirely with those already before the public, either in this
country, or in France, I have only to observe, that although
others may have laboured the subject for a greater length of
time, none, I am sure, have brought more diligence to the
enquiry, or have more frequently revised the observations
that were first made, with a view to correct any errors that
were detected. With respect to the drawings by which the
facts are illustrated, I can answer for their fidelity, should any
voucher be necessary beyond the author's name. On the mode of breeding in the Oyster. The structure of the ovaria is 0 little developed, that it is
difficult to. discover these organs ;; and in the first instance, it
requires the aid of the microscope for that purpose, even in
the breeding season,

In this country, where the beds are not allowed to be
disturbed during the season in which oysters spawn, we
labour under a considerable disadvantage in the prosecution
of this enquiry ; and I am indebted to my friend Mr.
