Mr. Granan further remarks, © Colloidality is invoked chiefly with the view of account-
ing for the ready reunion, the redintegration as I have called it, of fragments of ice
brought into contact with each other. It is a very general (perhaps universal) character
of colloids to adhere and reunite when two masses are pressed together. In fact all our
adhesive substances, gum, glue, starch, &c., belong to the class of colloids. Even glass,
which is a colloid of fusion, shows the adhesive character, two sheets of polished plate
glass often adhering s0 thoroughly as to tear up each other's surface when forcibly sepa-
rated. Another colloid adhesive like ice, is fused phosphoric acid—- glacial * phosphoric
acid as it is called, in prescience, one might imagine, of this discussion !
