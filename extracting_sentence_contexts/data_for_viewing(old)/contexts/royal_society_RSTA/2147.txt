Figure 5. Switching probability curves versus voltage for different pulse widths. The curve with 0.5 ns pulse width is of interest,
since the stochastic STDP implementation depends on a short pulse over the switching threshold. The curves corresponding to
longer pulses, 5 ns and 10 ns, show the switching threshold is slightly lower. The threshold margin is required to ensure that the
portions of the Vy_e waveform shown in figure 3 not contributing to the STDP behaviour, remain below the switching threshold
even for longer pulsewidths.

deterministic as opposed to stochastic. We also note that pulses with amplitude below 0.45 V have
almost no chance to switch the MT] (at least up to 10 ns pulse widths). We use these facts to design
the input and output neuron spikes. This is explained in detail in the next section.

(b) Stochastic spike timing-dependent plasticity learning in magnetoelectric-magnetic
tunnel junction synapses

We have described how shaping the pulses appropriately and mapping it to switching probability
characteristics of ME-MTJ synapses can lead to probabilistic potentiation and depression in
figure 3. We present the results and parameters of pulse shapes that result in stochastic STDP
learning in ME-MT]J synapses. The pulse designs are shown in figure 6b, where the peak positive
amplitude Vpos = 0.35 and peak negative amplitude Vneg = 0.3. The width of the positive part
of the pulse is set as tpos = 1 ns, whereas the decay constant for the negative part of the pulse is
Teg = 8ns. The voltage difference across the ME oxide, Vaz = Vpre â€” Vposr, at the event of a
