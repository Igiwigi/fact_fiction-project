discovery of the cleavage of the yelk as a process of the fecundated egg; to Rus-
conr*, Barr and others, its full exemplification in the Amphibia; and to Barry% and
Brscnoxry its detection and elucidation in the Mammalia.

The agent immediately concerned in these changes is believed to be the embryo
vesicle and its progeny, produced after the disappearance of the germinal vesicle.
But it is yet uncertain what is the origin of the embryo vesicle, or whether it exists
in the unfecundated ovum. As cleavage of the yelk certainly is not the result of the
disappearance of the germinal vesicle, which disappears from all ova of the Ampbhibia,
whether they are afterwards impregnated or not, I was desirous, at the commencement
of my experiments on impregnation, to learn from direct observation whether the un-
fecundated ovum ever passes through any stage of cleavage ; since the ascertainment
of the fact in the negative would be an important test in the experiments I was about
to make. Por this purpose it was necessary to collect many pairs of frogs at the
proper season, and when from symptoms which are s00n recognized, it was found
they were about to cast their ova, to wait patiently, perhaps for many hours, for the
result, in order that the exact condition of the oyum, impregnated naturally, should
be first ascertained. SWAMMERDAM long ago remarked that the spawning of the frog
takes place very rapidly © by a single effort||.” It is often completed, as I have
found in the English species, in a few seconds, and usually in less than a minute,
during which the male impregnates them, s0 that if the animals are not closely
watched the opportunity of observing the earliest appearances of the oyum is lost.
Having noted the condition of the impregnated ova of several pairs of frogs within
the first few minutes after spawning, I found those of different individuals vary much
with respect to the white or inferior surface, and exhibit appearances that may readily
