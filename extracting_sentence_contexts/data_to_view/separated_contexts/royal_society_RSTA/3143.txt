Because of (3.61), this is equivalent to proving that
[AaBpAw Bw] - Aa” Byr = [v2 AgBy] - Aan Bur = vb yt rea By
= AgBy - [Av ByAarByr] = AgBy - [vit Ag By] = yee, yah AgByr
SS yt AaBy = yep vie AaByr
and, because of (3.57), this is equivalent to

abl ,ab” _.a'b”, ab"
Verb Vary = Verb’ Verb’

which is identically satisfied because of (3.49). The two partitions of the identity A = (Aq) and B = (By) are maximal in A. In fact, if an element
X= oq AadbAaBy commutes with all the A,’, then, for each A,’,

Ay (x sida) = ravAaBy = (x sida) Aw

For each a” £ a’, multiplying both sides on the left by Ag”, one finds
0= >> darvey?” Aav By.

This gives
Aa 2 bao = Ag Yo davvinp By = Aa pe (» wet) By,

where the second identity is due to (3.42). Therefore, for each b’,

aro Aa By = (x Aavpary(B 14) Ag By =: da Aa By.

Therefore, for all a’, b', Aqt = Aa’, independently of b’, and this implies that

ab ab a

This proves maximality of A = (A,). Exchanging the roles of A and B, one obtains the maximality
of B = (By).
