without the aid of further embryological studies. If ib is 80, Renilla amethysting
is a perfect connecting link, s0 far as the structure of the peduncle goes, between
R. reniformis and the axis-bearing Pennatulids.

In all the latter forms the axis, when present, is 8uspended by these four septa, and
it is difficult to understand their appearance in Renilla amethystina, except on the
supposition that in this form an axis once existed, but was s8ubsequently lost. In
R. reniformis, the four 8epta also have disappeared, leaving only the peduncular
septum as the representative of the septum transversale. This view is supported by
the development of the colony which, as pointed out in section 19, indicates the
derivation of Renilla from an axis-bearing form, resembling the Bathyptilee.

As a matter of fact, we find the axis developed in very different degrees in the
various genera of the Pennatulids; and in certain of the Veretillide, as Clavella or
Cavernularia, the axis is very small or, even in s0me 8pecies of the same genera, quite
absent. Whether the rudimentary condition or total want of an axis in these forms
is due to the gradual loss of an axis cannot be determined ; bub the probabilities
certainly appear to be in favour of snch a view, since these genera have a much less
primitive structure in some other respects than some of the axis-bearing forms. We
are perhaps able to get 8ome idea of how the axis might be gradually lost. Since the
axis ends at some distance from the tip of the peduncle, a certain amount of moyement
is still permitted to the latter ; and the great development of the peduncular museles
indicates that this power of movement must be an important factor in the life of the
organism. In Renilla the power of movement is of vital importance (see p. 784), and
an axis would be of no conceivable use. Ib is easily conceivable that the power of
