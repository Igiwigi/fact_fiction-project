Further development of a

tensile pre-stress of muscle fibres did not affect longitudinal
wave propagation speed or frequency (figure 5). This suggests
that mechanical cues do not play a central role in the propa-
gation mechanism of early gut contractile waves. This
conclusion is further supported by the fact that softening of
the gut by collagenase led to an increase in wave velocity
(figure 4d), contrary to what is predicted by mechanical
models of wave propagation in biological tissues [8].
