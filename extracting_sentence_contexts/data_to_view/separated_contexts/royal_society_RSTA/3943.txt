For
example, the sub-field of proteomics is aiming to identify and quantify large numbers of proteins
present in extracts of cells, tissues and biofluids. Quantification can be absolute or relative. In
fact, many of the biochemical applications of MS rely on relative quantification. In these cases, it
is sufficient to report a change in the relative levels of biomolecules in the analysed samples. However, in other cases, it is critical to provide the results in absolute units (concentration
units such as moles per litre, or amount units such as moles) [14-16].
