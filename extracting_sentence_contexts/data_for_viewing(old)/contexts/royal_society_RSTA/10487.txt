We see from the nature of the above function that the value of k would decrease

with enormous rapidity in the neighbourhood of the absolute zero; so that, although
the resistance of metals decreases steadily with decreasing temperature down to the
lowest temperatures yet reached, it is quite possible that it becomes infinite again at
the absolute zero. The fact that the resistance of pure metals is proportional to the
absolute temperature over a wide range, together with the high values of m which
prevail at ordinary temperatures, seems to indicate that for most metals & has
practically reached its maximum value, where it varies only slightly with 0.

For this reason we are led to the conclusion that the discrepancies of 1 are not
due so much to disturbances produced by its temperature-variation (except, perhaps,
in the case of carbon) as to the fact that the exponential coefficient b is a function of
6. We have seen that b = ©/R, where ® is the work done by a corpuscle in escaping
from the metal, and R is the gas constant for a single corpuscle. Now
R= 35 X 107" roughly, and b = 5 x 107 for platinum, so that ® is approximately
equal to 107!,
