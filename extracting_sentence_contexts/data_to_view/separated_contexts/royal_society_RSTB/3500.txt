All descriptions concur in the recognition
of its connection with a neuromere next in front of the easily identified first-prefacial
of our classification. Biraneck (87) in the chick, Frorrep (’92) in the mole, and
Broman (’95) in man, all allege the existence of a connection between the Trigeminus
and our first-prefacial neuromere itself. Such a connection is undoubtedly lacking in
our specimens of Ornithorhynchus, and the generally recognised absence of nerve-
connection has in fact earned for this neuromere the designation of “ nervenlos ” from
v. Kuprrer (loc. cit., p. 264). Whilst emphasising its barren character, NEAL, however,
remarks that “late in its development the fibres of the sensor root of the Trigeminus
connect with its convexity” (Joc. cit., p 248) in Squalus. A persistent commissural
portion of a neural crest continuous, in front, with the Trigeminus Anlage, may, in some
cases, have simulated an actual trigeminal connection with this neuromere.
