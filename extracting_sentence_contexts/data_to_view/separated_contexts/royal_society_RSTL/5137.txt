To ascertain what effect the molecular structure of wood
has upon the transmission of heat through it, constitutes the object of the first part of
this investigation. Upwards of twenty years ago MM. Ds 1a Rivs and DzCanporre instituted an
inquiry into the conductive power of wood*, and in the case of five specimens
examined established the fact of the feeble conductivity of the substance, and also
that the velocity of transmission was greater along the fibre than across it. The
manner of experiment was that usually adopted in inquiries of this nature, and ap-
plied to metals by M. DeereTz4+. A bar of the substance was taken, one end of
which was brought into contact with a source of heat and allowed to remain 80 until
a stationary temperature was assumed.
