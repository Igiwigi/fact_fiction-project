The separated ions are detected by an ion detector in the space or time 3
domain. Electric signals, produced by the ion detector, are subsequently processed to produce :8
mass spectra. In fact, mass spectra can be viewed as histograms, which provide information on ig
the number of ions at different m/z values. The detected ions may correspond to the original : a
molecules, their fragments or other species formed during the ionization process. MS enables :&
direct identification of molecules based on the mass-to-charge ratio as well as fragmentation {2

patterns.
