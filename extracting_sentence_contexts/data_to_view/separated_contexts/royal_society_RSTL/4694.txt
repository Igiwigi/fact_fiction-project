These centra contain none of the cancelli or Haversian canals seen in the ordinary
forms of bone; the conditions which lead to the formation of both the one and the
other have obviously no existence here. Bearing in mind the physiological relation-
Ship of these tissues in the Ray to those of the higher mammals, this deficiency of the
higher osseous elements will be readily understood. Another important fact also to
