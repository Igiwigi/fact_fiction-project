We may conceive a point consecutive (or indefinitely near) to.a given point.

64. If the coordinates of the given point are (x, y, .. .), those of the consecutive point
may be assumed to be (x +dxr, y+dy, - . .), where $2, 3y,. . . are indefinitely small in regard
t0i(@94);

65. It may be remarked, that, taking the coordinates to be (y+X, y+Y, . . .), there is
no obligation to have (X, Y, . . .) indefinitely small; in fact whatever the magnitudes of
these quantities are, if only X : Y :...=7: 9:..., then the point (y+X,y+Y, . ..) will
be the very same with the original point, and it is therefore clear that a consecutive
point may be represented in the same manner with magnitudes, however large, of X, Y,... But we may assume them indefinitely small, that-is, the ratios a +dw : y+dy, : . ., where
>z, By, . . . are indefinitely small in regard to (&, y, . . .), will represent any set of ratios
indefinitely near to the ratios (@ : y, . . .). The foregoing quantities (>z, 3y, . . .) are termed the increments.
