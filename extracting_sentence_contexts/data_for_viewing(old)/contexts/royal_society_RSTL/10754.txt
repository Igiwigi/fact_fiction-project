$4. The effect is called positive when the piece of iron affected bas its thermo-
electric position (with the assigned temperatures of the junctions) shifted towards
bismuth in the thermoelectric series. In other words, the effect is called positive
when it causes a current to pass from the part affected to the part unaffected through
the hot junction.

The following (& 5-16) is a summary of the results stated in the paper referred
to above as © Part I.,” illustrated by figures taken from that paper.

$5. The firs effects of loading are in many cases somewhab uncertain. This may
be ascribed to the fact that continuous portions of any sample of wire differ more or
less in thermoelectric quality, and the yielding which occurs during the first loading
is apt to make some variation in the precise position along the wire of the hot
junetion. On the whole, however, the experiments agree in showing that the first
effect, of loading an annealed iron wire is negative; that is to say, if there is no current
before the load is applied, the effect of a moderate amount of load is to make a current
flow from the unstressed to the stressed portion of the wire through the hot junetion.

This is in agreement with observations published as long ago as 1856 by Sir W.
Trnows0N, who has laid the foundation of the snhject in Part IIL. of his great series of
