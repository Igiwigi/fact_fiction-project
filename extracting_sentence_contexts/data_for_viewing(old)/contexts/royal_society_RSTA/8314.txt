on comparatively shallow water will have periods quite different from those of the
monsoon type.

Near the coast we have a sloping bed, the inclination to the horizontal being variable
and in general small, except very near the coast line. The depth of water will be about
100 feet or 200 feet at a distance of 10 or 15 miles away from the coast. The analysis
previously adopted for finding the effect of wind in producing surface waves over large
areas of the sea and the corresponding elastic waves over the surface of the earth takes
account of the finite depth of water and will therefore hold approximately for the
shallow sea near the coast, provided we assume an average value for the depth between
the coast line and 15 miles off the coast. The analysis, of course, makes the assumption
that the sea is unlimited in extent, but in the shallow sea near the coast we have plainly
a boundary. The effect of the boundary will in general be expressed by the known fact
that a set of waves in advancing against a sloping beach will maintain their periods but
will diminish in wave-length and speed. The periods of the waves over the earth’s
surface will, therefore, be given approximately, as before, by

where dis the average depth of water. The observed periods of waves over the shallow
sea near the coast agree fairly well with those given by this formula. For small depths,
the periods of waves for different velocities of wind are easily picked up from the first
three lines of Table I. The two cases of (1) an average depth of 50 feet, and (2) an
average depth of 100 feet, are important, as these will represent roughly the order of
the average depth of the shallow sea near the west coast. It will be seen from fig. 7
