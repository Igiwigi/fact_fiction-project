Concerning the first question, opinions were various, and the
most intelligent persons were uncertain whether very soft or
hard gold was to be preferred; and, in respect to the second
question, it must be observed, that although the prevalent opi-

had never been fully and satisfactorily determined, this oppor-
tunity was embraced, in order that every doubt might be
removed.

The great value of the material, had hitherto prevented pri-
vate individuals from ascertaining these facts by experiment ;
and, as a public concern, this subject of investigation, although
80 important to political economy and to science, does not appear
to have been noticed by any European government, until the
Right Honourable and enlightened Members of the abovemen-
tioned Committee proposed the inquiry, and furnished the re-
quisite means for making the experiments.*
