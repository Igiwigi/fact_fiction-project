go through analogous motions. The snake has no sternum and sternal ribs; the
bird has no set of diaphragmatic ribs with floating cartilages ; all its lower vertebral :
ribs articulate with sternal ribs. All the external intercostals are inspiratory, all the

internal expiratory (FY 6-8).

46. In Mammalia the superior intercostals have the opposite action to the inferior, be-
cause the $uperior and inferior ribs have opposite motions.

When I exposed the muscles of the living and breathing Ass, I was surprised to
find that while the superior external intercostal muscles were invariably inspiratory,
the inferior were as invariably expiratory, and that while the posterior fibres of the
same muscle were inspiratory, the anterior were expiratory. These were the facts ; |
I could not gainsay them. It was only after much inquiry that they became intelli-
gible, not until I had comprehended the varying movements of the ribs at different
parts; then everything, step by step, became lucid.

The sole duty of the muscles is to move the ribs. It is not because two muscles,
between two distinct pairs of ribs, have the same direction of fibres and the same
name, that they perform the same functions; it is because the two sets of ribs
go through the same motions simultaneously. If one set of ribs, the superior,
approach each other, while the other, the inferior, go further apart, on each inspira- |
tion, ought we not, & priori, to infer that the two sets of muscles passing between the
two sets of ribs will have different functions? that if the muscle between two snperior |
ribs that approach each other be inspiratory, that between two inferior ribs that recede
