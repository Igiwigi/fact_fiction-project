Discussion

The results of these experiments may best be summarised and discussed by considering
separately the various thalamic elements which were involved.

Nucleus ventralis. —It is a well-established fact that the ventral nucleus of the thalamus
is the main terminal nucleus of the fillet system. In three of the experiments the fillet
was directly involved by the lesion. In rat BS 1, fig. 14, the lesion was confined to the
upper part of the trigeminal fillet, and the medial and spinal fillets escaped injury.
Degenerated fibres were traced up from the site of the lesion to the most medial part of
the fillet of the opposite side into the anterior colliculus, the region of the pretectal
nucleus and the ventral thalamic nucleus. In the latter, Marchi granules extended up
to its antero-lateral portion. In rat BS 2, fig. 15, the fillet system was injured in the
medulla. Here, again, degenerated fibres were traced to the anterior colliculus, the
pretectal nucleus, and the ventral nucleus. On one side there was a fine deposit of
Marchi granules in the medial medullary lamina (in the substance of the intralaminar
nuclei—nucleus paracentralis and nucleus centralis lateralis). This deposit is apparently
associated with fillet fibres which course through the medial medullary lamina in order
