The published work on the plant is confined, so far as I know, to the two papers
by SrenzeL and ScuEn«, already cited. As the two specific names appeared in the

The slab is 13 to 14 mm. thick (text-fig. 1, D), and on the upper face a portion of the stele is preserved,
as in the Chemnitz specimen. I wish to express my sincere thanks to Prof. Dr. Soergel for permission to
examine this as well as other specimens in the Goeppert Collection.

publication is known only for ScHenx’s paper.* The fact that J. T, Srerzun’s label
accompanying the Chemnitz specimen gave kirgisica as a synonym, seems to indicate
that the specific name ludwigii has priority, but for this there is no conclusive evidence ;
and I have not been able to ascertain any further facts bearing upon the point at issue.
However, the question is of no great importance, and need not detain us here.

Srenzeu’s description is fuller, and his figures are much more accurate than ScHENK’s.
As a part of the leaf-bearing stem was included in Srenze’s specimen, he was able
to indicate the affinity with Asterochlena lara, which he was describing at the same
time. ScHenK, on the other hand, having only the petioles at his disposal, referred
his fossil to the artificial genus Rachiopteris, although he recognised the resemblance
with Clepsydropsis. His figure of the specimen is inaccurate. Not only is the orientation
of the petiolar strands quite different from that shown in the figure, but even the contour
