The formula of this salt therefore is C,, H;, N, Og+2C, O,+2HO. It is the binoxa-
late of fucusine with two equivalents of water. The neutral oxalate is much more
Soluble than the acid salt, but the crystalline form of both salts is the same.

The perfect isomerism which subsists between furfurol and fucusol, extending as it
does to the products of their decomposition, is certainly not a little astonishing, and
may perhaps induce some chemists till to regard them as identical substances. I was,
in fact, for a long time inclined to the same opinion, and it was only after a careful
comparative examination of both oils, and especially of their respective bases, that I
was led to conclude that they are only very analogous, but not identical compounds.

Oil from Moss.

A quantity of common Sphagnum was digested in a distilling apparatus with dilute
sulphuric acid, exactly in the way already s0 fully described. It yielded a considerable
quantity of an oil, which, so far as I could judge, is identical with fucusol. It formed
amide with ammonia, which, when it was boiled with an alkaline lye, yielded a similar
difficultly crystallizable hase, whose double platinum alt crystallized in the same thin
flat prisms as those of fucusine.
