anew framework was used to study global existence. The following theorem was proved in [9]:


Theorem 1.2. Suppose that ||fo||L° < 00 and |\dxfo||L~ <1. Then there exists a global in time weak
solution of (1.5) that satisfies

fe C((0,T] x B)NL™((0, T], W!™(R)).
In particular, f is Lipschitz continuous.

The question of whether the constant 1 (which is independent of the physical parameters of
the system) in the L* bound of the derivative of the initial data is sharp or not is still open. The
proof of theorem 1.1 constructs initial conditions that have parameters that need to be taken big
enough to ensure turning. Taking both these two facts into account, our initial motivation was to
quantify and bridge the gap, finding or approximating the threshold C for the L® norm of d;fo
such that initial data for which ||0,fo||L~ < C exist globally, and for each € > 0 there exist solutions a
with |]0,fo||L-~° =C + € which develop turning singularities. =
