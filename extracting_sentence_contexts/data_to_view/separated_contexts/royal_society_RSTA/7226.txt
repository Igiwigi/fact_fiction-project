It was decided
that half the total energy of both the a- and f-particles emitted from the splinters should be
considered as being absorbed by the solution. In the later experiments the correction was
in any case small. The second uncertainty arises from the fact that the radon is not completely removed
as soon as the tube is opened; the amount in solution probably decreases roughly expo-
nentially during the removal period. By taking samples of solutions during and after the
radon removal period it was estimated that 1 min. could be taken as the ‘average life’ of
