For the purpose of ascertaining the extent of natural vision,
it will not be necessary here to give the equalisation of stars
of the gd, zth, 6th, or 7th order of distances; but taking now
the light of one of the stars of the 2d order of distances for
a standard, I tried many that might be expected to have the re-
quired light, and found that when # Andromede, with its light
reduced to one quarter, was in the standard telescope, the
equalising one gave w (FL. 48.) Pegasi for a star of the 4th
order of distances. That is to say, the equalisation proved.
that, if Arcturus were placed at four times its distance from

us, we should see it as a star of the 4th magnitude, and also
as one of the 4th order of distances. Proceeding in the same manner with y Pegasi taken as a
standard, I found that its light reduced to & was equal to that
of q (FL. 70.) Pegasi, when seen in the equalising telescope;
and that consequently Arcturus, removed to 8 times its pre-
- gent distance from us, would put on the appearance of a star
which in our catalogues is called of the zth or 6th magnitude,
but which would in fact be of the 8th order of distances. As the foregoing experiments can only show that a star of
the light of Arcturus might be removed to 8 times its distance,
and $till remain visible to the naked eye as a star of between
the zth and 6th magnitude; it will be proper to take also
other $tars of the first magnitude for the original standards,

For instance, if we begin from Capella as the standard star,
we may with + of its light equalise Ãž Aurige and 8 Tauri,
which $tars will therefore be of the 2d order of distances. With + of the light of 3 Tauri we equalise Tauri and ; Aurige;
they will then be of the 4th order.
