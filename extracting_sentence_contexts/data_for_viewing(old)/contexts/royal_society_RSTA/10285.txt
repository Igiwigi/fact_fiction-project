Of these axioms, IX Hp R secures that space is of three dimensions at least, and
XHpR secures that it is of three dimensions at most, and XITHpR is the
“Euclidean” axiom. From these twelve axioms the whole of geometry* can be
deduced. The well-known parabolic (i.e., Euclidean) definition of distance (not given
here) assumes an important significance, and all the usual metrical properties follow.

The Extraneous Relations.—Nothing could be more beautiful than the above issue
of the classical concept, if only we limit ourselves to the consideration of an
unchanging world of space. Unfortunately, it is a changing world to which the
complete concept must apply, and the intrusion at this stage into the classical concept
of the necessity of providing for change can only spoil a harmonious and complete
whole. Owing to the fact that the instants of time are not members of the field of
the essential relation, the time relation and the essential relation have (so to speak)
no point of contact. To remedy this, another subdivision of the class of objective
reals is conceived, namely, the class of particles (where the particles are the ultimate
entities composing the fundamental “stuff” which moves in space). These particles
must form part of the fields of a class of extraneous relations. Each such extraneous
relation is conceived as a triadic relation, which in any particular instance holds
between a particle, a point of space, and an instant of time. Also the field of each
such extraneous relation only possesses one particle, and no particle belongs to the
field of two such relations. Thus each extraneous relation is peculiar to one particle.
Also, as has been pointed out by Russent,f to whom the above analysis of these
extraneous relations of the classical concept is in substance due, the impenetrability
