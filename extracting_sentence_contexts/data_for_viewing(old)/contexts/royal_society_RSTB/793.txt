cortex from the velum interpositum and traversed it from without inwards paralle
with and very near to the surface of the summit of the hippocampal gyrus.
The presence of these blood-vessels which enter the cortex from the ventricle and
run towards the surface in this region is remarkable, since the plan of blood-supply
of the rest of the gyrus hippocampi, as of other parts of the cortex, is for the vessels
to enter from the pial surface. It seems to point strongly to the existence in
embryo of a ventricular pouch which has closed up in the course of development.
The fimbria increases in transverse sections very rapidly from before backwards;
retaining throughout, however, its strap-like form. As already mentioned, it is
separated from the alyeus by a deep groove or pocket. Another small groove marks
off the portion of the alveus which lies beneath the fimbria as a separate column,
more distinct in the sections behind 6 than in the section figured.
The sections show in a very striking manner, owing presumably to the fact
they are taken from a young animal, the way in which the fibres of the alveus t
origin in the cortex of the hippocampal convolution, pass between its columns of cals

sweeping inwards beneath the floor of the ventricle, curve round the groove
between the alveus and fimbria into the fimbria, in which eventually they assume
a longitudinal direction. In sections of osmatic brains the formation of the fimbria
from the alveus is obscured by the origin of large numbers of fibres in the hippo-
campus proper, if it is allowable to restrict this term to the reflected cortex.* The
fibres of the alveus are crossed at right angles by fibres which pass outwards into the
