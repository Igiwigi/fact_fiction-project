The 37th or second caudal is even more compressed than the first, and has no
trace of transverse processes. The 38th is somewhat less compressed, and shows no
distinction between centrosteites and neurosteites. Its arch bears a very inconspicuous
diapophysial tubercle, and there is a distinct neural spine. It is the last vertebra
with which the ilia are in contact, so that the syn-sacrum of Apterya includes three
thoracic, four lumbar, four lumbo-sacral, three sacral, and three caudal vertebre.

The name sacro-caudal, applied to the first three caudal vertebree by Mivarr,
although convenient in some respects, is hardly necessary. If, in the designation
of the vertebrae, the fact of their union in the syn-sacrum is to be expressed, the
last three thoracic should be called thoracico-sacral, and all the lumbar, lumbo-sacral.
As already stated, I propose to retain the name lumbo-sacral for the 29th-32nd
vertebrae, not to intimate their union in the sacrum, but to express the fact that
they are vertebra of a special character, coming between undoubted lumbar and
probable sacral vertebrae.

The 39th or fourth caudal is the first free vertebra of the caudal series. It is
considerably smaller than its predecessors, and its neural spine is so short as to be
practically obsolete. In it also there is no distinction between centrosteites and
neurosteites, the ossification of the body passing dorsad into the neuroids. There
is a very short and inconspicuous diapophysis. The 40th differs from its predecessor
in the possession of a short cartilaginous parapophysis (fig. 187, Cd. 5, parap.) in
addition to a very inconspicuous diapophysis.

In the 41st-43rd (6th to 8th caudal) the di- and par-apophyses have united into a
