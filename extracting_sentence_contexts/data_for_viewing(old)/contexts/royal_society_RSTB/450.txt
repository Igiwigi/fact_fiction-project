The bearing of these facts obviously requires no further comment, and the more so
as they are but confirmatory of the results we obtained in our analysis of the cortical
representation of these parts.

CoNCLUSIONS.

As the foregoing paper is but a collection of detailed facts: we can only offer as
conclusions a few bare statements.

1. The fibres of the excitable portion of the internal capsule are arranged from
before back, in the same order as the foci of representation in the excitable part of
the cortex, taken along lines drawn at right angles to the direction of the fissure of
RoLANpo.

. 2, This applies to the great divisions of the body, 7.Â¢., head, upper limb, &c.

3. The arrangement of the fibres for the different segments of each great division is
likewise that which prevails in the cortex.
