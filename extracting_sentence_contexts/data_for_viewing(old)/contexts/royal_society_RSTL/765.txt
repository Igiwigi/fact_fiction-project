of 7, at the place where y was, which being 6 days sooner than
the former position, (See fig. 6,) reduces the rotation to 56
days. All the foregoing views are from unconnected periods,
where only the ultimate returns of each appearance have been
attended to; but now, I shall examine a long interval with
many intermediate changes, that between June 18th, and
September 17th 1796, wherein are included the most intricate
irregularities and vicissitudes : these observations are already
printed at full length in the Philosophical Transactions for
1797, and therefore can at any time be inspected : indeed, I
