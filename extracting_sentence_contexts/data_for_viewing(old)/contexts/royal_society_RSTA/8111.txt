established, though it may operate before. Moreover, the high temperature in the
“nose ” of the flame would probably considerably modify any such arrangement.

(iii) Thirdly, the combustion in the flame, being a chemical reaction involving rapid
evolution of heat, entails the passage of a rapid agitation of molecules through the
gaseous medium, corresponding very closely with the head of a “wave.” Such a
“wave ” will change shape as it passes along the tube; but whether, starting with a
disturbance along the axis, it would change to a spiral wave-front is not easily established,
though it is quite possible. If, however, such were the case, combustion would travel
along a spiral path at a speed corresponding with the wave-speed of the combustion in
the flame front ; and in such event, the medium would not be moving spirally as a
whole, but a wave front would travel spiral-wise down the tube at the flame speed. This
view of the matter (if true) would seem capable of accounting for the facts so far observed,
the banded appearance of the “ tail” being ascribable to periodic waves along itself.

Experimental.

Before describing in order the relative flame photographs, it will be convenient now
broadly to summarise the principal experimental results obtained to date, since this
will help the reader to understand the meaning of the photographs which invite his study
in detail.

Apparatus.—In all essentials the apparatus employed was similar to that already
described in Part IV, but from time to time modifications were introduced for special
purposes, which need not be detailed. The explosions were all carried out at room
