The scum and turbidity were sensibly the 8ame
in all the tubes, though the period of boiling varied from five to twenty minutes. On
the same day the neutralized infusion of the same hay was perfectly brilliant and free
from 8cum. Three days subsequently, however (that is to say, on the 10th of November),
the neutralized tubes also became turbid and covered with scum.

'The salient fact here to be noted is, that in neither the neutral nor the acid chamber
did a single tube of the old Heathfield hay-infusion maintain its primitive clearness and
freedom from scum. The old London hay behaved substantially as the old Heathfield hay, no single
tube escaping either in the neutralized or the unneutralized chamber. The dried new London hay comes next.
