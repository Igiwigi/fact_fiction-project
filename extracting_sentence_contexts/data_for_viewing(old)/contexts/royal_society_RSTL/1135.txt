Keady, andthe mountains 'on each side ; its thickness too,
wherever we can try it, is very great; yet this stratum, which
in its entire: state must have spread like a roof far above the
present surface of these valleys (which are now sunk deep
into the schistose substratum) has not left a particle of its
debris behind, nor is a single lump of white limestone to be
found, until we come to the quarries, that is, to the edge of the
Solid, untouched stratum.

Conclusions.

The conclusions that unavoidably follow, from the consi-
deration of these facts are,

That the hills and mountains, in the district I have been
describing, were not raised up or formed as they now stand,
but that they are the undisturbed remains of strata that were
left behind, when stupendous operations carried away the
parts that were once contiguous to them.

That the inequalities of this surface were all produced by
causes acting from above, and carrying off whatever they
touched, without in the least disturbing what was left behind.
