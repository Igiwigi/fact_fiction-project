the CKN singular set for which the corresponding value of h is h = —1. Thus, the lower bound
h=—, given in (3.10), prevents solutions from approaching this set. An alternative and more
general way of expressing this result in d-dimensions is to say that for any d < 4, which implies
that Imin = ;(1 — d) > —1, the Leray scaling exponent /1 = —1 has no probability of occurrence. It
should be stressed that this is not a rigorous proof of Navier-Stokes regularity for d = 3: the lower
bound /min in (3.9) has its origin in the application of the MFM and the dissipation length scale
ny to the Navier-Stokes equations. This is a collective result derived from putting the two models
together. Nevertheless, to a physicist it is highly suggestive that Navier-Stokes singularities are
prohibited.

5. Conclusion

The power of the multifractal method lies in the fact that a spread of values of the parameter /1 are
employed. Whereas the discussion so far has been restricted to the lower bounds on ht and C(h),
now we wish to discuss the physical manifestations of these bounds. In its original formulation,
there exists a fractal dimension D(h) for each value of h [1,3]. Is there a parallel with the
Navier-Stokes equations operating over an equivalent range of dimensions? Before addressing
this question, at this stage it is worth considering the implications of the many numerical
simulations performed on the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations [30-41]. The contours
of the dissipation or strain fields are typically displayed in a cube and all have similar features: at
intermediate times flattening occurs producing pancake-like structures, followed by the roll-up of
these quasi-two-dimensional objects into quasi-one-dimensional, stretched filaments. Depending
