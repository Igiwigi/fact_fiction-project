body displacement. But both he and pe Sait-VENANT agree to make the end

* Since writing the above, I find that Professor Lamp (‘ Proc. Lond. Math. Soc.,’ vol. 21, p. 70, paper
read December, 1889) has worked out the same problem in the form of a series of circular and hyperbolic
functions, but he has left his results in this form, without interpreting them further, and I cannot discover
that he has considered end-conditions.

sections distorted. As a matter of fact, what really happens at a built-in end is
quite unknown. Under these conditions any solution which makes U = 0, dV/dx=0
over the ends must be restricted to the case of an infinite continuous beam resting
upon a series of equidistant supports, each at the same vertical height; the load
carried by the beam being exactly repeated over each span. A rail under its own
weight and carried on sleepers is an approximate example, In this case PocHHAMMER
and Rrptire’s solutions are exact, and it is then legitimate to make the span as small
as we please.

In practice such conditions will but rarely occur, because, as is well known, any
slight difference in the height of the supports, or in the manner in which the beam
bears upon them, will upset the symmetry altogether.
