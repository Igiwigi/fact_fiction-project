The break is,
however, useful as a reminder that le and md are the solidi of two different substances. If the gap cm really exists, the solid alloys below it ought to be complexes of
two bodies. Although we have not been able to detect the fact, it is quite possible, from the
way in which the f disintegrates, that there may be such finely grained complexes. For, unlike the C transformation, which is an obvious solution of « in a liquid
followed by the crystallisation of the very different 8, the D change is one of
disintegration throughout each 8 crystal, a change that might conceivably be a
separation into two phases, An alternative supposition is that the points ¢ and m
are coincident, and that the change at D is a case of dimorphism, the 8 and y having,
at their transformation temperature, the same composition. But the evidence we
have for the position of the solidus makes it difficult to bring m up toc.
