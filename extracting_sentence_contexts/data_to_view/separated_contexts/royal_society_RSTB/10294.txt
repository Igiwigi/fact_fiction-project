To address this hypothesis,
investigators have employed mesenchyme-free cultures of
lung epithelium to test the role of growth factors to induce
differential proliferation as a mechanism to promote branch for-
mation. Interestingly, FGF stimulation of mesenchyme-free
airway epithelium promotes a homogeneous increase in pro-
liferation, with no correlation between branching pattern and
focal epithelial proliferation [176]. In fact, these culture systems
revealed that epithelial branching precedes the establishment

bifurcate to generate two daughter branches.
