(46.) Efficiency of a Vapour-Engine without heating by compression. The numerical example of article (44.) sufficiently illustrates the fact, that the strict
fulfilment of the condition specified in article (43.), as necessary to the attainment
of the absolute maximum of efficiency of a vapour-engine, is impossible in practice. Let us consider, in the first place, the effect of dispensing with the process DA,
during which the fluid is supposed to have its high temperature restored solely by
compression. The effect of this modification is evidently, to add to the heat expended, that which
is necessary to elevate the temperature of the liquid from -, to r,, and to add to the
power developed an amount represented by the area ADE, fig.
