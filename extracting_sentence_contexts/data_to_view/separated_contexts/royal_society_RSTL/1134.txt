The
grains of the Ulve, Ceramiums, &c. according to him, do not
leave any coat when they germinate, and are consequently
gemme carpomorphe. Every candid naturalist will easjly
acknowledge, that we are not possessed of observations suffi-
ciently decisive to enable us to speak dogmatically, on pheno-
mena 80 little obvious as the germination of these grains. But
I will not contest the fact, I will only examine the principle. This general rule, of judging whether these grains be seeds
or gems, by their leaving their coats in the germination, or
not, is contradicted by nature, both in the instance of gems,
and in that of eggs. All gems, properly so called, throw off
their scaly hybernacula in the act of germinating.
