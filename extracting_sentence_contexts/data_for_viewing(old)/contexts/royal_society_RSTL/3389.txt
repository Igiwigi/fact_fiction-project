the hand or by an instrument, the muscles are wasted, and the neck thin; yet in
breathing, the mastoid muscle and the trapezius muscle swell and become as firm as
a piece of board.

Anatomical investigation shows the roots of the spinal accessory nerve arising far
apart from the muscular roots of the nerves of the arms: indeed they are more nearly
allied to the roots of sensation than of motion ; and in the instance above, we find
common muscular actions cut off, and those of respiration perfect. We see the sen-
Sibility in the whole extent of the respiratory passages, and the influence of the will
retained, through the respiratory nerves. The same phenomena are presented in the
common case of hemiplegia.

Such facts countenance the view which was presented to the Society, where a pe-
culiar office was ascribed to these nerves, and a distinct name given to them.

But there remain some questions of great difficulty and much interest. And I am
now happy in taking the assistance of the experiments made by various ingenious
gentlemen.

* Some haye supposed that the diaphragm expands the chest laterally; an effect which I cannot conceive
possible.
