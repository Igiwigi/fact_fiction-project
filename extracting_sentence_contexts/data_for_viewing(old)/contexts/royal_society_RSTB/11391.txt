The third experiment showed that the internal directionality of
the images is not able on its own to induce these biases, at least
with the small amount of practice provided.

Present results add to evidence by Gobel et al. [41] to
suggest that exposure to picture books is one factor that can
provide the kind of experience that induces the early start of
spatial biases [8,26,31]. It is noteworthy that, in the present
experiments, the mirror comic succeeded to change spatial

logically valid for children. Parents often spend a considerable
amount of time looking at picture books with their children
from a very early age [35], showing them the pictures, pointing
at them, pronouncing their names aloud and talking about
them, all of them activities which direct the attention of the
baby in a very clear and consistent manner. Moreover, chil-

The only difference with Experiment 2 was that the frames as in the book used by Gobel et al., allowing scanning from

biases, with the former exacerbating them and the latter
