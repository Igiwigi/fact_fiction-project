This eventually .
will lead to the formation of dendritic structures evolving in a mushy layer and compensating
the thermal or constitutional supercooling [9-11]. In those parts of the mushy layer where the
metastability level is small enough so that nucleation does not happen, the processes of particle
coalescence (Ostwald ripening) and agglomeration may occur [12-16]. In view of the fact that
it is difficult to study all possible crystal growth processes simultaneously, the mushy layer can
conditionally be divided into different regions with a predominant role of one or another of the
aforementioned growth mechanisms. A schematic representation of the mushy layer structure is
given in figure 1. Note that throughout this paper, we theoretically study the metastable region
III (the phase transition process at its intermediate stage) where nucleation and growth of crystals
are of primary importance.
