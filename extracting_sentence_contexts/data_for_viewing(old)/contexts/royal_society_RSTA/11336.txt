general be the variable ¢ of §§ 3 and 4. But the variables 7 so found will solve the
problem of conformally representing the z-plane, regarded as bounded by a number
of finite lines radiating from a point, on a curvilinear polygon in the 7-plane, such
that the sides of the boundary can be transformed into each other in pairs by
certain projective substitutions. The variable ¢ is one of these variables, characterised
by the condition that the infinite group generated from these substitutions is a
discontinuous group.
We can, in fact, find the functions T in this case. We must have
