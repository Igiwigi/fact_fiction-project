For the remainder of this section, let A and B be self-adjoint positive semi-definite operators on
a Hilbert space X. Assume that A has compact resolvent, and that B is bounded. Assume further
that
||Bx\| > 0 for every (non-zero) eigenvector x of A. (4.1)

The general approach given below in fact works under much milder assumptions on A and B, but
in view of our applications to damped wave equations, it is reasonable to restrict our attention to
this particular setting. Consider then the following second-order Cauchy problem in X:

it+Biu+Au=0, u(0)=u0, i(0)=1, (4.2)

for certain initial values uo, u; € X. Setting U =(u,1), this second-order Cauchy problem can be
rewritten on the space ¥ := D(A‘) x X asa first-order Cauchy problem

U=AU, U(0)=(uo,11) € X, (4.3)


where

A= ( 0 |) , with D(A) = D(A) x D(A). (4.4)

The operator A generates a Co-semigroup of contractions (T(t)))>9 on 4 by the Lumer-—
Phillips theorem and a simple perturbation argument.
