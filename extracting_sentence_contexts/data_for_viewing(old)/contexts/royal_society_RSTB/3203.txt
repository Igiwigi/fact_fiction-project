These are clear and numerous. There are two kinds of openings. Some lead into
channels which penetraté deeply and seem to carry the blood straight to the foetal
side of the trophosphere. These have a lining of a peculiar syncytial tissue, having
large nuclei which, like their cytoplasm, stain very slightly. These are confined to the
middle region of the embryo swelling, and almost certainly may be said to convey the
arterial stream (Jf. A.).

The other kind of opening is not lined by any such syncytial layer, and opens into
channels which are apt to run parallel with the columnar epithelium. These I take
to be the openings for the venous stream. ‘Text-fig. 11 (I.V.).

Tt is, of course, impossible to speak with certainty, but the fact that the lining
layer alluded to in connection with the presumably arterial channels is in direct
continuity with the walls of the channels in the stroma, and nearly always shows a
very sharp boundary line between itself and the trophoblast, points to its being ot
maternal origin, and probably an ingrowth of cells along the channels of the arterial
stream,

These facts I have shown diagrammatically in text-fig. 11, page 185.

This arrangement of blood supply is very usual in placentas, by means of which
the maternal arterial blood is taken at once to the foetal side of the placenta.
Cf. Mouse (Jenkinson); Rabbit (Duva). That there should be apparently so slight
a connection, if any, between trophoblast and somatopleur is, I believe, unusual.
