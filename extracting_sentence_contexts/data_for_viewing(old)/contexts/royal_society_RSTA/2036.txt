with 0 < Be <1, 0 <a <1 two material parameters, [t-] =[T] is an additional material constant
representing the characteristic time of the material observed in a creep test and sign(e) is the
signum function.

It may be observed that values of a, B- and t, are represented in figures 6 and 7 for the
considered tissues. Inspection of equation (3.2) reveals that the creep function coalesces with the
original formulation of Nutting obtained by experimental data conducted for rubbers, concrete,
steel, but not for biological tissues as in fact (¢(a, t)) for an assigned value of o is a creep function,
that is (e(o, t)) = ¢¢(s, t) =s% = J(t) for s > 0. Solid lines in figures 4 and 5 represent fits of the data
with equation (3.1) and excellent agreement among curves and data may be observed as expected
for power-law representation of ligament and tendon hereditariness [4]. The Nutting Law given
in the form |s|**sgn()J(t) has been obtained by considering a creep test. The equation, since
equation (3.2) is nonlinear, may be obtained from the corresponding relation for the relaxation
test as happens in the linear case. In order to archive this result, we proceed with the relation test
on the specimen for patellar and hamstring tendons. Previous considerations about the averaged
values of the creep test results may be reported for the relaxation averaged data in figures 10
and 11 and for the log—log plots reported in figures 8 and 9 for the patellar and hamstring
tendons, respectively. Solid lines in figures 8 and 9 represent linear fitting with equations (omitting
j-dependence)
