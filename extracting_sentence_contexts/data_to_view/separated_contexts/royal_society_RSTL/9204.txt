On examining the differences given in Table XXV. for the outer sheeb, I noticed that
theory and experiment agree closely up to the immediate neighbourhood of the optic
axis, line 16 ; while in the neighbourhood of the optic axis, Table XXVI., line 15, the
increase in the differences is much more gradual. In fact, if we compare the experimental values of p, in Table XXV., lines 11-14,
and Table XXVI., 12-15, for about the same values of 0+0# we find considerable
differences. This led me to calculate the results of other sets of experiments covering the same
ground, which had been already made. The following table gives the results of one snch eb, taken about two months
previously ; during the interval the goniometer had been taken partially to pieces, and
afterwards refocussed and seb again.
