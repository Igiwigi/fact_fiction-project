Few cell divisions were found in
dioestrus and in pro-oestrus, but the mitotic activity increased during early oestrus to reach
a maximum in full oestrus (figure 31, plate 32). Thereafter it fell quickly to another low level
in late oestrus and metoestrus. Throughout the whole cycle the rate of division in the cells
of the medulla was very much lower than that in the cortex, and in fact, no mitoses at all
were discovered in this region during dioestrus, pro-oestrus, and early oestrus. In full
oestrus several cell divisions were found in the medulla, but they were never so numerous
as to make comparative counting easily possible. Two or three mitoses were also found
in late oestrus, but they did not appear to be so numerous at this stage as they were during
full oestrus.
