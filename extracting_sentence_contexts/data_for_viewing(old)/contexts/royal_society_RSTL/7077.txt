= (53) Let it be observed that we can see & priori that, were it not for the distinction
£ between facultative and non-facultative portions of space, it would be impossible for
= each point corresponding to a given system of invariants to possess an unequiyocal
S Character; for in such case there would necessarily be free continuous communication
— Posible between all the points on each side of D inter 8c, and consequently we should
S be landed in the absurdity of conceiving the general equation of the fifth degree not
£ to admit of division into cases of four, two, or no imaginary roots; D being negative,
S we know, would imply two roots, and not more than two, being imaginary ; and accord-
ingly D positive would imply either that four roots are imaginary or none—not sometimes
one and sometimes the other, but in all cases alike four imaginary, to the exclusion of the
8upposition of the roots being all real, or else of all the roots being real and never four
imaginary, Thus we see that the mere fact of a given system of invariants communi-
cating a definite character to the roots, implies the necessity of the invariants exercising
a restraining action over each other's limits, and that where this restraint does not exist
it is impossible that the character of the roots can be determined by the values of the
invariants.

(®) It is clear from the definition, that a region can only be bounded by G tho amphigenous surface, and D
the plane of the discriminant: and granted (as will be shown hereafter) that G and D touch each other in only
one continuons line, it becomes obvious & priori that there can be but two regions on one side of D and a single

region on the other.
