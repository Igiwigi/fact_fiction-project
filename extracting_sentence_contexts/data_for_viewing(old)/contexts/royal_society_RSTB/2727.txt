In these experiments twenty-two leaves were inoculated,,and infection resulted on
eleven leaves. In two cases quite powdery Oidiwm-patches appeared in 5-6 days on
some of the inoculated leaves, and—all the experiments being safeguarded by controls—
it is quite clear that under the conditions created the form of F. Graminis on
Hordeum sylvaticum can fully and virulently infect Triticum vulgare. ‘To illustrate
the course of growth a summary of one experiment may be given here. Conidia ot
the fungus growing on “ cut” leaves of H. sylvaticum (which had been inoculated on
August 18 with conidia from 7. vulgare, and which bore at the date of the
present experiment—August 29—small powdery Oidium-patches) were sown on four
“cut” leaves of 7. vulgare, and four “ cut” control leaves placed by their side. On
the third day three of the inoculated leaves showed signs of virulent infection, the
conidia having produced numerous lobed haustoria and hyphal branches. In fact, the
virulence of infection shown here was as great as any observed in the Petri dish
cultures. On the fifth day one leaf bore over the “cut” a large and vigorous
Oidium-patch, quite powdery with little masses of ripe conidia ; the two other leaves,
also, bore each a smaller group of ripe conidiophores. All the controls remained pertectly
free. On the eighth day two of the three infected leaves bore powdery Oidium-
patches; the four controls showed no signs of a fungus. On the eleventh day all the
leaves were dead,
