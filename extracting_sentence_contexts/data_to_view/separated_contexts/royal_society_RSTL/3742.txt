This fact has been carefully verified by repeated experiments; for instance, the
moment a portion of calculus, which had been steadily decomposing in a weak solu-
tion, is plunged into a stronger, action abruptly ceases ; it is as suddenly re-esta-
blished when the assay is returned to the weaker solution. This alternation from
weak to strong, and the reverse, was often repeated with solutions variously modified,
but invariably with the same general result. On first remarking the above circumstance, I was not aware that BerzeLius had
previously recorded a somewhat similar fact in relation to the action of weak solu-

* When a fragment of phosphatic calculus is placed in a solution of super-lactate of lead, under the mi-
croscope a dense areola at first surrounds it ; from this, after a time, radii proceed, until the assay assumes a
stellar appearance, of dazzling whiteness. AND ON THE INTRODUCTION OF DECOMPONENTS INTO THE BLADDER, 15

The preceding experiments being apparently conclusive as to the decomposing
effect of certain salts of lead on phosphatic calculi, out of the body ; the next point
to be determined was the effect likely to be produced by the introduction of their
solutions into the living bladder. They had been found, on repeated trial, inoffensive
to the eye and to the urethra ; they are constantly applied to abraded and inflamed
surfaces, as well as used internally, with the greatest advantage : and, although some of
these salts, by long-continued absorption, are apt to produce a train of specific morbid
symptoms, it has been stated by pbysicians of eminence, that lead acts deleteriously
only when imbibed in the shape of a carbonate ; that when the acetate appears to
produce colica pictonum, it does 0 from being converted, after its reception into the
body, into a carbonate; and furthermore, that this conversion may be avoided by
super-acidulation, the salt may then be administered with perfect safety in large and
efficient quantities.
