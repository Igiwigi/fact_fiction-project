macroscopic shape, the mathematical ingredient that it characterizes; T;B is the tangent space
to B at x. Two linear operators play then a role: the formal adjoint of F, indicated by F*


and defined to be such that F* ¢ Hom(T;B,,T;B), and the transpose FT, which is such that
FT €Hom(TyBy, TyB).

At any y€B, the basis {é;} determines another metric, say g, which we can call spatial to
emphasize even already in the terminology the difference with g. The pull-back C := F'@F of the
spatial metric into the reference place B, along the deformation, has components C4g = FRE? ,
and is a metric too, due to the nonlinear constraint detF > 0. Such a metric, also called the
right Cauchy-Green tensor, allows us to define naturally a measure of deformation as a comparison
between C and the material metric g; we write in fact E:= 3(C — g), obtaining in this way a second-
rank tensor with components E4g = 3(C ‘AB — SAB). We may also introduce the second-rank tensor
E:-glE= H(C — 1), where g~! is the inverse of g, with components indicated simply by 948, and
Tis the second-rank unit tensor, to have an expression of the strain measure more common. The

version C of the right Cauchy-Green tensor is defined by C:= g~!C =g"F*gF = F'F, which is its a
standard expression. : =
