Every morning, on commencing my experiments, T had an interesting example of the
power of glass to gather a film of aqueous vapour on its surface. Suppose the tube
mounted, and the air of the laboratory removed as far as the air-pump was capable of
removing it. On allowing dry air to enter for the first time, the needle would move
from 0* to 50*. On pumping out it would return to 0‚Äù, and on letting in dry air a 8econd
time it would swing almost to 40%. Repeated exhaustions would cause this action to
sink almost to nothing. These results were entirely due to the vapour collected during
the night in an invisible film on the inner surface of the tube, and which was removed
by the air on entering, and diffused through the tube. Tf the dry air entered at the
end of the tube nearest to the source of heat, on the firs: and second admissions, and
sometimes even on a third, the yapour carried from the warm end to the cold end of the
tube was precipitated as a mist upon the latter, for a distance sometimes of nearly a foot.
The mist always disappeared on pumping out. It is needless to remark that facts of this
character, of which I could cite many, were not calculated to promote incautiousness or
rashness on my part. I say very clearly how easy it was to fall into the gravest errors,
and I took due precautions to prevent myself from doing 80.

Knowing that a solution of salt was almost as opake to radiant heat as water itself,
I was careful to examine whether the effects which I had observed with aqueous vapour
might not be due to the precipitation of the vapour on the surfaces of the plates of
