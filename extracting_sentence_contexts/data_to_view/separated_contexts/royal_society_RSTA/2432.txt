When SM is employed in a system, data is encoded both as spatial and PAM constellation
symbols. Since only one of the LEDs is activated during transmission, the overall spectral
efficiency of the system is log,(N;) + log,(M) bits/s/Hz. As noted in [16], a signal constellation
with zero intensity cannot be used in optical SM, due to the fact that there would not be an active
transmit element and hence no spatial information exists based on SM principles. In this paper,
the intensity levels of M-PAM signals for optical SM are given as
