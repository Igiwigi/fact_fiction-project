The use of pressure sensors at the bed for this so-
called recovery problem is popular due to low cost and
convenience in installations [1]. Several researchers have
addressed this problem in the past, such as [2,3]. As most waves relevant in ocean engineering do not
fall into the category of small-amplitude theory and,
in fact, linear theory may overestimate wave heights
by over 10% even for waves of moderate amplitude
when compared with observed data [4], investigations
have been carried out to relax the approximations of
linearity and small amplitudes by researchers such as
