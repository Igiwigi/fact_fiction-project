Imagination is a kind of freedom, a renewed ability to perceive and express the truth’ [54]
and that ‘Freedom is not strictly the exercise of the will, but rather the experience of accurate vision which, when this becomes
appropriate, occasions action’ [55].


to take a step back, to assess and consequently to change or stop belongs more to imagination
than to fantasy. Action that is driven by fantasy, which carries on relentlessly because the mind absorbed in
fantasy does nothing to check it, is obviously active and yet in another sense it is peculiarly
passive. Fantasy may be characterized by a certain disengagement, but our problem is not, in fact,
that we live lives of calm and restful retreat from action, or even lives of indolent lack of activity—
would, in a sense, for the good of the planet, that we did—but rather that we are incessantly
building, consuming, travelling and so on. A fantasizing outlook is frequently today one of living
frantically but without attention. By contrast, it falls within the domain of true imagination to be
capable of a form of restraint that is nonetheless strikingly inceptive, for all it is a stepping back
from action.
