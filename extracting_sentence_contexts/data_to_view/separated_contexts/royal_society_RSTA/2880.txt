If the cases that were deemed inadmissible or struck out beforehand had been taken
into account, this may have made a difference to the assessment. This potential difference now
remains invisible. The conclusion that the facts of the case, rather than the applicable law,
determine the outcome is also problematic because whenever the Court itself decides that a case
is inadmissible, the judgment has no section on law, which means that the results are skewed.°
The system was restricted to violations of articles 3, 6 and 8 of the ECHR, as this provided
more balanced data (equal amount of violation/non-violation cases). This restriction, however,
makes invisible how a case is framed, as many cases are framed as violations of more than
one human right (for instance, combining articles 3, 6 and 8 with articles 5, 7, 9, 10 and 14 of
the ECHR). Furthermore, the algorithm was trained only on existing case law, using 90% for
training and 10% for validation—no out-of-sample testing was reported.
