Now if the yellow sensation were in fact a mixture of red and green sensations, it would
be expected that the direction effect for yellow would have a value which is equal, or nearly
equal, to the mean values for red and green; but such is not the case. This suggests that the
visual mechanism for yellow is separate from that of both red and green.

(146) The colour discrimination curve

On the basis of Youngâ€™s theory it would be expected that there would be poor colour
discrimination at each end of the spectrum, since only one sensation is aroused here. In
the green region, discrimination would be expected to be better,-because the red- and blue-
sensation curves are both approaching the base line. In the yellow region, very good
discrimination would be expected, because the red and green curves are intersecting and
one curve falls steeply, as the other rises, with change of wave-length. The same reasoning
