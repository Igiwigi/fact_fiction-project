The perivitelline space and the outer follicle cells are important from the point of
view of the floatation of the egg in that they lessen the specific gravity of the egg as
awhole. The egg of Ascidiella aspersa and Corella willmeriana* are the only two so far
discovered that float to the top of still water, and those of the first will sink very quickly
if the follicle cells are washed off. As a matter of fact the tendency to float of the eggs
of C. willmeriana has resulted in this species being viviparous, for Cu1Lp shows that
the adult habitat is such that the siphons are directed downwards, and the buoyant
eggs float away from them and so are retained within the atrial cavity until they are
hatched. In most other cases, the eggs sink more or less slowly in still water but are
caused by very slight agitation to rise from the bottom. This response to agitation is
lost if the follicle cells are detached.
