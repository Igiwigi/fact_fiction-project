the branchial vessels refers to the ordinary more or less lacunar lymph spaces, or to
the “‘ fine ” vessels described above ; probably, I think, the latter ; but TRors evidently
did not realise that they formed a system distinct from that of the general lymphatics.

The resemblance between the branchial plexuses of the “ fine ” vessels and the plexuses
formed by the nutrient arteries in the gills and upon the mucous membrane of the gill
arches in Polyodon, described and figured by ALLEN (2, p. 107, Plate XI, fig. 20, d),
suggested at first that the two might be of the same nature. But this comparison is
negatived by the fact that these vessels in Lophius have no connection with the arterial
system, and that there is in addition to them a fully formed system of nutrient arteries.

If, as seems no doubt to be the case, these vessels are part of the lymphatic system,
it is possible that certain facts recorded by Frrcuson (5) in his paper on the thyroid


DUCTLESS GLANDS AND LYMPHATIC SYSTEM OF ANGLER FISH. 51

of Elasmobranchs may have a bearing on their morphological status. In Elasmobranchs
the thyroid is stated by Ferauson to be surrounded by a large venous, or veno-lym-
phatic sinus, connected through a hyoid sinus with the jugular veins. In the walls of
this sinus Ferauson demonstrated a peculiarly rich plexus of fine vessels, which he
regarded as of a definitely lymphatic nature. He says: “ The vessels form perivascular
lymphatics about the venous sinuses. Ink or a coloured fluid injected into the connective
tissue about the hyoid and thyroid sinuses readily fills the anastomosing vessels, forming
a sheet-like mass of peculiar form. Ink thus injected can also be traced into the peri-
