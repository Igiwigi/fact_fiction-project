It is well known that many of the differential equations integrated by the above
processes, and whose integrals are in some cases capable of an expression merely
symbolical by reason of the number of operations to be performed being fractional,
may be integrated generally, when there is no second term, by means of definite
integrals. ;

Now with reference to most of the equations of this description here integrated,
I have observed that the symbolical form above given is capable of being instantly
(and, as it were, mechanically) converted into a definite integral of the form

=/ oz.*ds,

the function pz being typified in the symbolical solution by the form of the opera-
tions preceding the factor a”!. To explain this, let us take the equation

2m
D*u+—Du—Pu=0;

its $ymbolical solution is
u=k(D*—&)"—{a—(D*—c2)="0} ;

and the assertion is that a solution of the equation in the form of a definite integral
is obtained by writing for pz, k(z2?—c2)"=" and selecting the limits properly ; in fact,
it is known that

u=kſ" (2—&)"='v"d>
is a partial solution ; and as it is a known theorem, that if a= solve

it is also solyed by u=a" if for be written —n, we have for the complete solution
