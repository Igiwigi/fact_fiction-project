not act until the cirenit became permanently closed. The result of this was evidently
to reduce the apparent time of transit and hence increase the velocity. The second cause of error above indicated was rendered very likely by the fact that
the motion of the machinery in the works kept up a continual vibration in the ground. An automatic circuit-breaker was next introduced into this arrangement and the
distance reduced to 200 feet. A correction for instrumental error was in this case
determined from observations ab 100 feet.
