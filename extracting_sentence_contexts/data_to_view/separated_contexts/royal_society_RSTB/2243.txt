This overstepping is not in the skeletal muscles and in the
sensory structures of the skin greater than to include a half, or generally rather less,
of the adjacent segment, and it is regular in figure and extent. It certainly does not
seriously confuse the picture that it affords, of the general segmental plan of a part. I have now to attempt an exposition of the general scheme of arrangement I
believe evidenced by the facts detailed in the preceding sections. Before proceeding
to such generalisation, it is well to obtain, however, some answer to the following
questions :â€”Is the amount of overlapping of the skin-areas of the various spinal
nerves equally great in all body-regions? Is the amount of overlapping of the
various spinal nerves greater or less than that of the territories of peripheral nerve-
trunks?
