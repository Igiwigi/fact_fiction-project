Season—The range of temperature is much greater in April than in July ; the
following figures give the mean daily range (° C) in the four places :—

Gadau No. 3 No. 1 No. 4
ADH oie cap hins 16-2 17-0 18-8 15-0
J Spar sian 9-5 9-8 9-2 6-7

The fact that the range is less in July is due in the main to a lower maximum. For
instance, at Gadau the maximum in July is 8-5° lower than in April, whereas the
minimum is only 1-7° lower. c

Local differences—The temperature of Gadau differs very little from that at Screen 3
in the open country. This can be seen from the mean maximum and minimum,
and also the absolute readings. It seems unnecessary to pursue the matter further
and to work out the mean temperatures from two-hourly readings of the thermo-
graphs, and it is probably sufficient to assume that temperature records taken in the
clearing at Gadau can be applied to the whole of the surrounding country except
the actual thickets. When the readings for Gadau or for Screen 3 are compared
with those taken in the thicket, Screens 1 and 4, the general resemblance is still
surprising. A few points of difference will be noted; for instance, in April the
