; thus, in a
fatal case of empyema, the air procured from one lung that
was sound, consisted of

8.3 carbonic acid gas,
5.0 oxygene,
86.7 azote :
that from the other lung, which was condensed, and as it
were hepatized, of
12.5 carbonic acid gas,
2.0 oxygene,
85.5 azote :
whilst in another case, in which one lung was sound, and
the other abounded in minute cavities full of pus, air from
the sound lung consisted of
12.2 carbonic acid gas,
3.0 oxygene,
84.8 azote. Had the proportion of carbonic acid gas, in the instance
under consideration, been within these limits, the expla-
nation would have been attended with little difficulty ;
