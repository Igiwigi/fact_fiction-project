Outside the range shown, of course, the two parastichy sets run round the apex in
the same direction, and Fibonacci systems in the usual sense no longer exist. The curves
representing orthogonal systems run up to infinity (or to a plastochrone ratio of 1-0) at their
theoretical limiting divergence angles; here the parastichies in one direction reduce to a
set of points and those in the other to a circle. In order to illustrate the change in form of the curves drawn in figure 3 with alteration
of the intersection angle of the parastichy pairs, the pair 2:3 has been selected because it is
the lowest that need be considered in this connexion in phyllotaxis systems, and because in
this case the conditions are the most stringent for the present purpose, namely, to demon-
strate that only a comparatively minor error is involved if a phyllotaxis index, derived from
an apex conforming with a divergence somewhat different from the ‘ideal’ angle, is inter-
preted in regard to the parastichy relations as though (with this same phyllotaxis index)
the divergence were in fact exactly equal to the Fibonacci angle. In higher systems the
proportion of the total range in divergence angle having an error not exceeding 0-13 unit
is somewhat greater than in the 2:3 curves shown. TABLE 2

It is seen in figure 3 that the ranges of divergence angle, over which a uniform relation
between phyllotaxis index and parastichy intersection angle may reasonably be assumed
to hold, are very unsymmetrically divided at the Fibonacci angle itself, and that the
portion having the greater latitude alternates above and below this angle with the successive
parastichy pairs.
