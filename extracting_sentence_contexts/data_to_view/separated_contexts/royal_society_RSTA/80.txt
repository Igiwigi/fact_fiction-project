Such a material is considered to be isotropic in its undeformed state and to
obey the stress-strain relations (I,3-10). It is readily seen that if the strain components
(Cs €jys ++») are specified, the hydrostatic pressure p is indeterminate. This results from the
fact that the material is incompressible. On the other hand, it is shown (I, §5) that if the
stress components (¢,,,4,,,...) are specified, the hydrostatic pressure p can be determined
in terms of them by means ofa cubic equation, which may yield one or three real values for ,
depending on the magnitudes of the stress components and of the physical constant EF. It is shown, however, (I,§6) that only one of these values of /—the least—leads to real
values of the strain components (¢;,,¢,,,---)- It is thus apparent that if a cube of incom-
pressible, neo-Hookean material is subjected to a pure, homogeneous deformation and the
stress components in the deformed state are specified, the state of strain of the deformed cube
is uniquely determined.
