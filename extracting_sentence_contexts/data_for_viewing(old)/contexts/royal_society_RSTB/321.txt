The form of the out-lying cells found in these radiations of the dorsal root mayjbe
described as oval (figs. 6, 7, 8, Plate 4); one end is usually considerably the less
pointed. A nucleus, which is large and contains a very obvious nucleolus, is fairly cen-
trally placed within the cell, though often somewhat nearer the blunter of the two
extremities. The cells have not been observed isolated in teased preparations, but
they may really be of a more symmetrically bipolar figure than the foregoing descrip-
tion would suggest. Although they are certainly chiefly extended in the plane at
right angles to the long axis of the cord, a very slight inclination in such a plane,
either of themselves or of the section in which they lie, would suffice to truncate one
end of the spindle-shaped cell-body. In such a case the nucleus, if centrally placed,
would appear nearer to the more rounded pole. That this does actually happen and
frequently explains the somewhat unipolar appearance of the cell, is suggested by the
fact that the more pointed end, continued into an obvious cell-process, is sometimes
turned with the fibres of the dorsal root in the direction of the grey substance of the

cornu, and sometimes reversely, the blunter end, devoid of any obvious cell process,
is directed centrally, while the tapering extremity mingles with root-fibres on the
distal side, and is turned away from the grey matter of the cornu.
