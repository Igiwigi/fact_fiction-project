@ A glance at this table reveals the fact that the sound-wave calculated by my
ormula does not agree in velocity with the explosion-wave of pure electrolytic gas ;
‘Ybut as the electrolytic gas is more and more diluted with hydrogen or with oxygen,
=the observed and calculated velocities come nearer together, until, not far from the
Btwo limits of regular explosion, they are in close agreement. Conversely we have
geen that Berruetor’s formula gives the correct rate for pure electrolytic gas, but
‘Bdiverges more and more from the observed rates as the gas is diluted. Where
aBerrHELor's “@” fails to represent the facts, the “=” I have calculated does so ;

Band vice versd.

T advance the following hypothesis to account for this divergence. At the high
temperature of the explosion-wave the combination of hydrogen and oxygen is not com-
