Interestingly, we observe the least desir-
able effects on poverty at near and intermediate distances. As discussed above, the opportunity cost of protection is
expected to be highest near markets, thus insignificant or
even negative impacts on poverty would not be counterintui-

(i) Poverty traps

If protected areas were causing or exacerbating poverty traps, we
would expect to observe differentially negative socioeconomic
responses to protected areas among communities that were
poor at baseline. In figure 1a, we find no evidence that Boliviaâ€™s
protected areas are associated with poverty traps. In general, we
see the expected positive relationship between poverty in 1991
and 2012 for both protected and unprotected communities
(upward-sloping dashed and dotted lines).
