Simplifying further, assume that all elasticities are constant (denoted by *) and that 2 is the fraction of global production in
affected regions. Now the effect of an epidemic on global prices is proportional to —Q/(n* 6"). Buffering of global prices
implies 6° <1 and hence will always tend to increase global prices (remember 7* < 0). In fact, when price interventions
are uniform across the world, global prices adjust so that they have no net effect on local prices. For example, if the elasticity
of price transmission to local economies is 0.5—a typical figure for rice [35]—then the expression above says that global prices
double nullifying any benefits to local consumers. More realistically, price transmission will vary across countries and its
effects on world prices will be determined by the mean of country-specific intervention elasticities weighted by the country’s
contribution to global demand.
