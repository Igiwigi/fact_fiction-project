Interestingly, this same
temperature-dependence of temperature-dependent develop-
ment has recently been detected in terrestrial and freshwater

ectotherms [29] and similar patterns have also been noted in
trematodes [48]. Finally, the temperature-dependence of the
metabolic rate also seems to be temperature-dependent in
ectotherms—species living in warmer temperature tend to
have metabolic rates that are less affected by changes in temp-
erature than species living in cooler temperatures [29]. The
fact that these patterns are repeated across a wide variety of
taxa and at least two key rates (development and metabolic)
implies that there is some common factor that drives the evol-
ution of different temperature dependencies according to the
local thermal regime and deserves much more exploration. For now, we are at a loss to explain this pattern. Nevertheless,
finding that cold-water species have much greater tempera-
ture dependencies than warmer water species has critical
implications for how future climate change will affect
developmental durations and dispersal potentials in the sea.

(c) Dispersal potential and the future connectivity of

marine populations
We found that temperature increases are predicted to reduce
the developmental durations of marine organisms across all
of the world’s oceans, but particularly in the polar seas.
