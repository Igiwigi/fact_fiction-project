= At Peel Quarry I find considerable variation in the dimensions of what are unmistakable
a examples of 7. oliveforme. FVxcepting in size, I discover no difference between the
largest of these specimens and the 7” ovatum and T. oblongum of TanDLEY and HurtroN's
© Fossil Flora.” Professor NewBERrRy evidently recognizes this fact, since the two
examples of HiLpreTn's Trigonocarpon triloeulare which he has figured (7c. cit. pl. 42.
figs. 1-13, 13 @) differ in size quite as much as do the 7. oliveforme and T. ovatum of
the © Fossil Flora,” At the same time I cannot see any difference between the latter
species and that described by HiLpretn. I have already referred to the similar differ-
ence in 8ize between Mr. ArrKEN's specimen of Texapterospermum and that in the
York Museum. The 7. Dawesii (* Foil Flora, pl. 221), of which I have specimens
from Peel Quarry, appears to me to be distinct. In addition to its large size (23 inches
