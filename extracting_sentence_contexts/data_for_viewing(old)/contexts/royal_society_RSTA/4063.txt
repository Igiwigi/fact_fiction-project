associated with field rotation in highly anisotropic magnetic materials has recently attracted some
interest [30,31]. However, we will not consider here such situations and, in what follows, we will
discuss only caloric and multicaloric effects associated with changes of magnitude of the fields.

Although not imposed by thermodynamics, the response functions Ã©l are in general negative,
because ferroic properties are expected to reach a maximum value in the ground state. Therefore,
in general, the entropy decreases when a field is applied isothermally while temperature increases
when it is applied adiabatically. This corresponds to conventional caloric effects. Nevertheless,
in some regions of the space of thermodynamic parameters, eh can be positive and, then, the
caloric effect is denoted inverse, which means that entropy increases when the field is applied
isothermally, whereas temperature decreases when it is applied adiabatically. This behaviour can

ferroic properties, or associated with frustration effects, or a combination of both [6,32].

Let us now discuss multicaloric effects induced by application of more than one field. We 3
