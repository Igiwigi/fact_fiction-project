* The temperature coefficient determined by Guazeproox and Sxryver (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ vol. 183, 1892, A )
is 00076 between 0° and 15°—that is, for an average temperature of 7°5. The temperature coefficient
according to Kanne (‘ Zeitschrift fiir Instramentenkunde,’ August, 1893) is —000814—-000007 (t—15),
giving an identical value for t=7°5.

from the readings of the thermometer placed in it. Recent results of Kane agree
with our conclusions, and show that, in the H form of cell, the lag in the change of
the electromotive force with change of temperature is avoided, owing to the fact that
the liquid at both electrodes, being in contact with crystals of zine sulphate, is always
in a state of concentration. We have, after the conclusion of our experiments, set up
a few cells according to the instructions given in the Third Memorandum of the
Board of Trade. When proper precautions are taken to ensure equality of tempera-
ture, these cells agree within about one part in ten thousand with each other and
our standard cell. Taking account of the determination by GuAzgprook and
Skryner of the electromotive force of a Clark cell—1'4342 at 15° C.—and of the
slightly lower value obtained by Kauue, we have adepted 1°4340 as the value of our
standard cell in terms of the international volt. As temperature coefficient, we have
adopted that given by Kaun (see footnote on preceding page).
