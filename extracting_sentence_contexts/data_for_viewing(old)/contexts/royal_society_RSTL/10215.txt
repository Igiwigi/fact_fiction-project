moderate strength is led through the leaf from the upper surface between the sensitive
hairs to the under surface, there is a response at make, and no other. When stronger
currents are used (from one DANIELL to two GRoves) the first variation is followed by
a second, If the current is continued for a long period (30 seconds) a succession of
excitatory variations takes place at irregular intervals, as shown in the following


PROPERTIES OF THE LEAF OF DION A. 47

examples. Tf the leaf is expanded and not restrained, it may close at the. first exci-
tatory variation, 4.e., one to one-and-a-half second after the closure of the current.
But if the experiment is made at a low temperature (18* to 20* C.) this event does
not happen until after the third, fourth, or fifth variation. To observe these facts
the current of a GRovE cell is led through one lobe, while the other is led off (in
the usual way, to the electrometer, and the time after closure of the circuit noted by
the watch, as in the following experiments :—

I. Current of one Grove from above downwards for half a minute ; excitatory
variation at 3”, 9”, 13”, 19”, 23”, 30”.

Same current directed upwards—variation at closure only.

TI. Current of one Grove from above downwards for one minute ; variation at
1, 15”, 25”, 34”, 38”, 45”.
