of lead, washing the phosphate of lead and decomposing it by a stream of sul-
phuretted hydrogen gas. After exposure for some hours to allow the escape of
the sulphuretted hydrogen, the acid liquid, without being neutralized, uniformly
produced an opal-white flaky precipitate in muriate of barytes, which appeared

AND MODIFICATIONS OF PHOSPHORIC ACID. 277

immediately, unless the liquors were very dilute. This is also a character, I
find, of phosphoric acid recently ignited per se. The acid of our salt possesses
also the property of coagulating albumen. In fact, this acid appears to be the
glacial phosphoric acid, which had been hastily assumed by recent writers
| upon this subject to be the pyrophosphorie acid, but is totally different. I shall
i take the liberty to designate provisionally the acid of the fused biphosphate of
s0da, the Metaphosphoric acid, from an hypothesis of its constitution to be
immediately explained ; and the fused salt itself, the Metaphosphate of soda.
The metaphosphate of soda is insoluble in alcohol. Its solution in water is
= not altered by time ; at least no change could be perceived in a solution which
g had heen kept for several months. When exposed to a temperature not ex-

dries into a transparent brittle pellicle like gum. All my attempts to cry-

Â© pump, have failed. It never presented the slightest trace of crystallization.
