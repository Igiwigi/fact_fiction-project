variation between the different values was considerable, but not so large as the
variation found in the present experiments. The fibres used by Barnerr were,
however, all prepared from one crystal of quartz, and the results obtained would
therefore be expected to be more uniform,

Barnett also made observations to determine if there was any change of rigidity
with time. Experiments extending over an interval of four months failed to detect
any alteration, The present experiments show that with more accurate timing of
the torsional oscillations, variations in the rigidity can be detected, and that, when a
fibre is allowed to rest at the ordinary temperature of the laboratory, its rigidity
increases slightly. The increase of rigidity with time is, however, not so marked in
the case of quartz as it was found to be with metal wires, and the reason for this
may possibly lie in the fact that the structure of fused quartz is amorphous, while

* It is, of course, well known that the tensile strength of metal wires also increases as their diameter is
decreased,

that of a metal wire is crystalline. It is known that the effect of heat is to cause
the crystalline grains of which a metal is composed to grow, and this alteration of
the structure would mean an alteration in the rigidity of the material. The rate of
growth of the crystals at 100Â° C. would be very small, and it has been observed only
in the case of the softer metals, but it is probable that the present method can detect
