sent from their American possessions. It is therefore evident,
that an affinity does exist between potash and platina, in a cer-
tain state; and I imagine it to be this affinity, which causes the
oxidizement of the platina, when potash is kept in fusion- upon
that metal, '1 must however observe, that my crucible was
prepared by JaxneTTY, in Paris, according to a method he
has published in the Annales de Chimie; and that he always
employs arsenic, a little of which certainly remains united
to the platina. What influence arsenic may have, remains to be
determined. Soda does not form a triple salt with the oxide of
platina; for I have frequently kept this alkali in fusion, in a
platina crucible, for a long time; yet very little action was pro-
duced upon the metal. This fact seems to corroborate my
assertion, that the affinity of potash for oxide of platina, deter-
mines the oxidizement of the metal.


333 Mr. Cutngvix's Analysis of Corundum, and of

Whenever I suspected that platina had: been dissolved, I could
easily detect the smallest portion of it. A solution of platina, 80
dilute as to be nearly colourless, manifests, in. a very short time,
the colour of a much more concentrate solution, and becomes
reddish, by the addition of a solution of tin in muriatic acid.
This I have found to be,. by many degrees, 'the most sensible
