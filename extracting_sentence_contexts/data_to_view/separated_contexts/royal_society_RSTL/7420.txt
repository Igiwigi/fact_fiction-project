RANSOM ON THE OVUM OF OSSEOUS FISHES. 493

the varying amounts of air in bubbles which entered the cells, and by the accidental
re#ng of the inner sacs in many eggs, a mode of terminating the contractions not due
o the exhaustion of oxygen, and which is most apt to occur when the proportion of
is greatest, provided it be not changed. Nevertheless, in experiment h, with
irty eggs in the cell, and imperfect exclusion of air, the contraction ceased in
wenty-three hours in eggs distant from the air-bubbles, while in experiment j, with only
en eggs in the cell, and complete exclusion of air, they continued for twenty-nine
10urs,

& hours, leaving the yelk-ball globular and relaxed, while in experiment 9, with only
ten eggs in the cell, they persisted for more than thirty-five hours,

The pseudo-cleavage, or contractions of the concentrated formative yelk in unimpreg-
Ated eggs, and probably also the concentration of the formative yelk, seem to demand
eo presence of oxygen as well as a due supply of water: for in experiment 6, after
tFelve hours it was less advanced than in the ova of control experiment 3. Tt also was
wn to cease long before the yelk-contractions, and may be supposed to consume more
Fygen, although there are other explanations which may be offered of this fact, espe-
Ally the tendeney of the matter of the discus proligerus to undergo chemical change
a disintegration. J

Z Cleavage may be said to demand more oxygen than do the yelk-contractions, as in ex-
Eriments & to // it always ceased long before, and was more promptly checked by in-
Fasing the number of eggs in the cell. It is also more quickly arrested than psendo-
Heavage, and would scem therefore to need oxygen more.
