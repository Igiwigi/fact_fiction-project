Owing to the wide difference in structure between the lizard and the mammal,
and the complete absence of any living form that in any way helps to bridge the gulf,
it has been very difficult to prove that the reptilian so-called ‘‘ para-sphenoid ”’ is
really the mammalian vomer.

For the last 36 years I have been engaged in the study of the fossil mammal-like
reptiles of the Permian and Triassic beds of South Africa, and one of the problems
that has never been forgotten is whether or not the “para-sphenoid” of the reptile
becomes the vomer in the mammal. Of course, the paleontologist has rarely a
chance of studying any but adult specimens, and even in good adult specimens it is
often very difficult to determine the limit of bones, especially where the specimens are a
little crushed and the matrix hard. In fact, it has only been possible to unravel the
structure of the base of the skull in the mammal-like reptiles by having sections made.

It is only quite recently that we have known satisfactorily the structure of the base
of the skull in the Therocephalians, the Gorgonopsians, the Anomodonts, and the
Cynodonts. We also. know something of the base of the skull in the Dinocephalians,
the Bauriamorphs, and the Ictidosaurians.

In the Dinocephalians, as exemplified by Dinophoneus, we find a pair of large
prevomers in the front of the palate, and a small median vomer or para-sphenoid in
the basi-sphenoid region, and probably extending some distance in front of the basi-
sphenoid. The exact condition and size of the basi-sphenoid are unknown, and it is
also unknown whether this vomer or para-sphenoid is completely fused with the
