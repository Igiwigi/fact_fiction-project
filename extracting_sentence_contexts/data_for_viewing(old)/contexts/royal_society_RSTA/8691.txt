shown in the last columns of Tables VI., VITI., VIII. and [X., where the errors in the
visual readings are seen to be small and for the most part distributed quite irregularly.
On account of the smallness of the deviations from the simple law, it is difficult to deter-
mine the exact magnitude of the two additional constants which serve to express them
in the equation. The dispersion-constants selected for these calculations were
AP = 0-038, \.? = 0-06, but since the sum of these two constants 0-098 is almost
identical with the sum of the constants 0-030+-0-074 — 0-104 used in the case of
tartaric acid, there can be little doubt that the latter pair would have given equally
satisfactory results.

The negative rotation-constants, k,, as set out in Table XIII, are larger than might
have been expected, approaching almost to one-half of the values for the positive rotation-
constant k,. This is due to the fact that the dispersion-constant A,° of the negative
term is but little greater than the dispersion-constant ,? of the positive term; the

negative term must therefore be weighted somewhat heavily to produce any marked
alteration in the form of the curve.

Although the common form of tartaric acid, and the tartrates derived from it, are
usually dextrorotatory, negative rotations are occasionally observed, especially at high
