The mass of white light is finely seen in the impressions taken upon tin, but
never appears upon isinglass.

The preceding experiments do not_ afford any precise data for determining
the influences of refractive power. The realgar and the isinglass give fewer
periods of colour s0 as to indicate that, ceteris paribus, a diminution of refrac-
tive power, produces a diminution in the number and orders of colours, or
causes the minima to be developed at a less incidence. 'This indication, how-
ever, is opposed by the fact, that as the isinglass dries and consequently in-
creases in refractive power, the periods diminish in number, and the minima
are produced at less incidences. The modification of the tints by a change
of refractive power is here masked by the influence of other causes, namely, an
inferiority in the sharpness of the impression to that of the original surface,
and a rounding of the narrow spaces n subsequently produced by induration.
In the specimen of isinglass, therefore, already mentioned, which gave the
first limit of pink and blue at nearly the same angle as the steel, it is probable
that it would have developed the same limit at a greater inclination had the
impression been as sharp as the original.

In this uncertainty I conceived that the influence of a variable refractive
power would be best obtained by placing different fluids on the surface of the
