'The processes, which we may call the nerve-rudiments, are, as appears from
the later stages, equal in number to the muscle-plates. It may be pointed out, as must have been gathered from the description above, that
the nerve-rudiments have at this stage but one point of attachment to the spinal cord,
and that this one corresponds with the dorsal or posterior root of the adult nerve. The rudiments are, in fact, those of the posterior root only. The next or second stage in the formation of these structures to which T would call
attention occurs at about the time when three to five visceral clefts are present. The
disappearance from the notochord in the anterior extremity of the body of a special
central area rich in protoplasm serves as an excellent guide to the commencement of
this epoch.
