Here we do not seek for mechanical reasons why, for
Kistance, the upper should increase more than the lower half in turgor. We think
â€˜gf the pulvinus as a whole, and believe that changes in illumination act as signals to
+, in response to which, combined changes occur leading to adaptive movements. S In the same way I believe that we ought to look on the stomatal mechanism as a
whole, and think of the opening or shutting of the stoma as a movement in which
ihe guard cell and the general cell pressure in the leaf take a regulated share ; and
shat such regulation occurs adaptively in response to environmental signals.
& Nor do I see that there is any difficulty in believing that the guard cells may
Bliminish in turgor in darkness, in spite of the fact that turgor is ordinarily increased
Sy these circumstances. Darkness usually increases growth, but in the case of
tiolated leaves (or in an etiolated Coprinus)* growth begins when the lamina (or
Grap in the fungus) are illuminated, while the growth of the petiole (or stipe)
is checked under the same circumstances. In the same way it is perfectly conceivable

features in the guard cell which facilitate curvature during increased turgor; Scuwenvener also showed
that a change of shape in the guard cells occurring at right angles to the surface of the leaf influences
the width of the opening.
