The first attempt in
that direction was through Andrews’ matings [61], which kept only the axiom links of a proof. Figure 3 shows the matings for the two sequent proofs in figure 1—both sequent proofs have
identical matings. In fact, Andrews considered these matings to be the ‘essence’ of a proof, and
thus provided a proposal for a nontrivial notion of proof identity. The more recent work in [62]
provided a notion of proof composition for matings. However, checking the correctness of matings takes exponential time’.
