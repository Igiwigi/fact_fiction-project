A similar sequence of events has been observed in rabbit 35 and in two of the animals
in group B.

(ii) The response of the oestrous uterus. The response of the oestrous uterus to stimulations
of the neurohypophysis has been observed many times (107) in the animals in group C. Before describing the response in detail, it is worth mentioning the facts that (a) the response
varied slightly from animal to animal, but in any one animal was similar to that following
injection of posterior lobe extracts, (b) the response could be graded by varying the intensity
of the stimulus (i.e. by varying the 1.c.p.), (c) a critical 1.c.p. could be found, representing

a threshold stimulus (it is to be noted that the critical 1.c.p. to elicit the oxytocic effect was
slightly less than that for the anti-diuretic effect) and (d) the maximum uterine responses
to stimulation of the neurohypophysis were approximately equal to those following intra-
venous injection of 500 mU pitocin. The response of the oestrous uterus to stimulation of the neurohypophysis and to injec-
tions of pituitrin and pitocin is well typified by a series of records obtained from rabbit 35,
between 13 June 1944 and 23 June 1944 (see figures 15-20). At the time these results were
obtained, the animal had carried the buried coil in situ for 3 months and the operation for
vaginal transplantation, ovariectomy and stilboestrol tablet implantation was performed
5 weeks previously.
