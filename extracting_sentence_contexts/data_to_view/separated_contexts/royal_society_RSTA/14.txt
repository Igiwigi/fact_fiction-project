The relatively compact cluster of points in the bottom half of figure 1 is thought to
correspond to a species of Kuehneotherium, while the broader group at the top cannot be assigned
to Kuehneotherium, but to some related, but as yet unidentified, animal.

(c) Some key issues

(i) Covariance and correlation matrix principal component analysis

So far, PCs have been presented as linear combinations of the (centred) original variables. However, the properties of PCA have some undesirable features when these variables have
different units of measurement. While there is nothing inherently wrong, from a strictly
mathematical point of view, with linear combinations of variables with different units of
measurement (their use is widespread in, for instance, linear regression), the fact that PCA is


defined by a criterion (variance) that depends on units of measurement implies that PCs based on 6 |
the covariance matrix S will change if the units of measurement on one or more of the variables

change (unless all p variables undergo a common change of scale, in which case the new covariance _
matrix is merely a scalar multiple of the old one, hence with the same eigenvectors and the same 1B
proportion of total variance explained by each PC). To overcome this undesirable feature, it is :<
common practice to begin by standardizing the variables. Each data value xj is both centred and :
divided by the standard deviation Sj of the 1 observations of variable j,

Zip= 5 : (2.7)

Thus, the initial data matrix X is replaced with the standardized data matrix Z, whose jth column : 2
is vector zj with the n standardized observations of variable j (2.7).
