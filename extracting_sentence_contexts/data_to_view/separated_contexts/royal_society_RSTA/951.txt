The continuous nature of the
range of compositions suggests either that all possible sources, from more mafic to more felsic,
were tapped to form these granitoids, or that the sources were mixtures, in all proportions, of
mafic and felsic (or older TTG) components. The latter is our preferred scenario based on trace
element systematics: if their source included (or was even dominated by) a TTG component,
reworked ACP granites inherited the high-pressure signature of their precursor TTG. The mild
Eu (and Sr) anomalies are consistent with melting in the presence of plagioclase, and the fact that
REE patterns are not much more fractionated than those of TTG suggests that garnet was not an
abundant or dominating residual mineral. Granitoids with a mantle component, or sanukitoids, cover a very diverse group with no
clear chemical definition [37] and may have formed by a range of petrogenetic processes that
