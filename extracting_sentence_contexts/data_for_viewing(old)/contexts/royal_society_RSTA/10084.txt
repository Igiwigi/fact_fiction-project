recognised by imagining all the sunspots to have the same duration, each spot
also keeping the same area during the whole course of its life. It is obvious that
in this case the period having a length equal to the life of the spots would be
totally absent.

PROFESSOR A. SCHUSTER ON THE PERIODICITIES OF SUNSPOTS. 79

When we come to periods which are near to that of the solar rotation, periodicities
appear, owing to the fact that some of the spots persist during more than one rotation.
This effect will, however, disappear when the period is well above that of the solar
rotation. When the periods come near to 1°5 years, the sub-periods of well-ascertained
periodicities make their presence felt. Hence the limits chosen for calculating the
natural intensity of the periodogram must be confined to about 35 days on the one
hand and 1°5 years on the other. The average intensity of these periods may be
determined from Table VI., and is found to be 15,000. The probability of an intensity
greater than h times the average value is e~*, and we may perhaps begin to suspect a
real periodicity when this value is 1 in 200. This gives 5:3 as the value of h and
80,000 as the smallest value of the intensity which invites further discussion. When
h has the value 8, the probability of an intensity greater than h times the expectancy
is 1 in 3,000 and we may begin to be more confident that there is some definite cause
at work to bring up the periodogram to that value. The intensity in that case is
