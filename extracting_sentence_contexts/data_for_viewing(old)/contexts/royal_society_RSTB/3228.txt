much of its ferocious appearance. In the Neandertal, as represented by the
Gibraltar skull, the nasals are very broad at the upper end, and instead of
terminating at the point of contrary flexure are continued upwards with gently
flowing outline into the curve of the glabella itself, so that the nasion is situated
some 4 or 5 millims. above the bottom of the trough which marks the passage from
the nasal to the glabellar region. This is a primitive character, met with in the
higher apes and in young children (five years) of European races.

The magnitude and continuity of the frontal torus, the accompanying supra-toral
fossa which. gives emphasis to it, and the confluent passage into its curvature of the
nasal bones are all characters of great significance. The glabella, which contributes to
the composition of the torus, shares its importance ; but when, after full appreciation
of this fact, we have assigned to the glabella its value as expressed by its index, we
must be careful in subsequent analysis to eliminate its influence as far as possible ;
for to introduce it into fresh measurements of other characters would be to count it
over more than once and thus to exaggerate its part. Such a proceeding is all the
more dangerous since its real nature may be cloaked only too easily under the
obscurity of statistics. Yet the magnitude of the glabella certainly has this
illegitimate effect in several of ScHwALBEâ€™s measurements, such, for instance, as the
frontal angle, the altitudinal index, and the so-called bregma angle. This follows
from the fact that the line which this distinguished anatomist selects as a base is
drawn from the glabella to the inion, so that the glabella contributes to its length ;
a line from nasion to inion would have been less open to objection, a fact recognised
by Scuwaxpe, for he remarks that this would have certainly afforded a more
rational base, and only rejects it on the ground that the difference in the base
