136 P. L. WILLMORE ON SEISMIC EXPERIMENTS

The decision between (a) and (b) would be important in a study of the geology of the
upper layers, but the present work is concerned mainly with waves refracted up from greater
depths. From this point of view it is sufficient to point out that both hypotheses require the
existence ofa layer above the one which transmits P,, and thick enough to cause the observed
delays. In fact, the data will not decide between (a), (b) and (c), and in assigning an average
velocity to P, we have no means of choosing between a single layer whose velocity ranges
from 3-5 to 4-9km./sec. and a structure with a velocity of less than 3-5 km./sec. near the
surface, and 4-3 to 4-9km./sec.
