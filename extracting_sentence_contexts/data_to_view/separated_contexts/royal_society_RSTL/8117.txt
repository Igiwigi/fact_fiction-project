'=moon's apparent semidiameter,

C=brightness of an absolutely white plane illuminated by perpendicularly incident rays of the sun,

© =brightness of an absolutely white plane similarly illuminated by the rays of the moon,

v =elongation from the 8un=180%—e,

S=sun's 8emidiameter as seen from the earth. F It appears rather doubtful whether this small correction (which only amounts at most to x45 of the whole
heating-effect) should have been made at all, as from 8ubsequent experiment the deviations in different parts
of the scale were found to be very nearly identical with the same heating-ecffect ; in fact the difference was less
than the probable error of observation. + Strictly speaking this correction should have been applied to each single reading, not to the mean of a set
of readings, as was done to saye labour. :

use of it in the form e=



OF HEAT FROM THE MOON.
