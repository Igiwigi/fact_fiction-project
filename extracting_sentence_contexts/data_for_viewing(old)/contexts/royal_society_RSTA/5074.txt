— Fracture at the ‘microstructural’ scale, relating values of local fracture stress or fracture
toughness in test-pieces to the sizes and distributions of microstructural features. This
leads to a treatment of how the microstructural understanding helps to address events at
the ‘meso’-scale in ‘heterogeneous’ or ‘mixed’ microstructures.

— Fracture at the ‘nano’ or ‘atomistic’ scale, considering how fracture might occur at the tip
of an atomically sharp crack.


2. Assessment of structural integrity; linear elastic fracture mechanics a |

In recognition of the fact that a stress-concentrator is necessary for (engineering-scale) brittle
fracture to occur, measurement of the resistance to fracture of structural steels employs notched or : x
pre-cracked test-pieces. Up to some 40 years ago, material quality was assessed, using notched- 1
bar impact testing. A common example is the Charpy test, which subjects a bar of 10 x 10mm [fg
cross section, containing a 45° V-notch of depth 2mm and root radius 0.25 mm, to impact loading aoe
in a simple pendulum machine. The energy absorbed in fracture is measured as a function of :s
test temperature, and is observed to undergo a transition from high-energy ‘ductile’ fracture at :
high temperature to low-energy ‘brittle’ fracture at low temperature. Ductile fracture involves
the formation and coalescence of microvoids, centred on inclusions and other second-phase
particles. A full treatment of these mechanisms would lengthen this paper unduly: details can :
be found in reference [3]. Two forms of brittle fracture may be observed: one is transgranular =
cleavage across {001} crystallographic planes (typically observed in normalized or annealed mild 3
steels); the other is intergranular fracture along (ferrite grain-boundaries coincident with) prior- 8
