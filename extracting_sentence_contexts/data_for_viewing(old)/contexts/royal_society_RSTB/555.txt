risk and exposure to accidental sources of gain in the experiments in the chamber, in
the meadow, and on the tower, are such that the results could not of themselves be
accepted as at all conclusive. To the distinct gains observed in the experiments in
closed vessels no such objection can however be raised ; whilst the negative results in
the sterilised soils constitute another element in favour of the conclusion at which
M. Berruetor has arrived.

It is, however, one thing to accept experimental results on the authority of
M. Berruecor, and another to adopt his arguments and conclusions in the application
of them to the conditions of practical agriculture. To avoid repetition, however,
further reference to this part of the subject must be postponed until the results and
conclusions of other experimenters have been considered ; for, to a great extent, the
same facts and arguments are applicable in reference to them, as to M. BerrHexor’s
results and conclusions.

2. The Experiments of M. P. P. Denurarn.*

The plan and methods of M. Denmrarn’s experiments to determine the losses or
gains of combined nitrogen were totally different from those adopted by M. Brrruetor.
They were indeed much on the lines of some of the Rothamsted investigations. He
sought to determine the actual losses or gains in the field, under the influence of
different manures, of different crops, and of different modes of cultivation. His
experiments were made on the farm of the Agricultural School, at Grignon, near
Paris, and extended from 1875 to 1885 inclusive. The land had been in lucerne for
5 years, 1870-1874. Four plots were then devoted to each experimental crop as
