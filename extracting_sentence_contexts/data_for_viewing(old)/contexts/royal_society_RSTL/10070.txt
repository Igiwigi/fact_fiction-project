In the course of May, 1881, a complete series of spinnings were taken, the arrange-
ments and adjustments being (except as above-mentioned) in all respects the same as
with the old apparatus. Five different speeds were used, and each of them on three
different evenings. The work of observing was also distributed as before, Dr. SCHUSTER
taking the readings of the principal magnetometer, and Mrs. SipGwick the simulta-
neous readings of the auxiliary magnetometer, while I observed the divided card and
regulated the speed. At each speed on each evening four readings were taken with
wire circuit closed, two with positive and two with negative rotation, and in like
manner four readings were taken with the wire circuit open. Observations on the
zero with the coil at rest were for the most part dispensed with, as it was thought

that the time could be better employed otherwise ; in fact, the mean of the two not
very different positions of equilibrium obtained with positive and negative rotation
when the wire circuit was open, gives all that is wanted in this respect. In the
actual reductions we only require the difference of readings with positive and negative
rotations.

It was hoped that these observations would have been sufficient, but on the introduc-
tion by Dr. Scavsren of the various corrections for temperature, for the beats between
