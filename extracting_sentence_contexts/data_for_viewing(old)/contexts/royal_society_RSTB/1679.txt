in its course is that of Messner.{ He fired small-bore bullets through canisters
filled with sterilised meat peptone gelatine, the bullets in some cases being clean
(control experiments), in others infected with cultures (micrococeus prodigiosus,
green pus, staphylococcus pyogenes being used) and also (when clean) caused to pass
through a layer of flannel on which a culture had been spread before entering the
canister. The results invariably showed that the bullet carried in the organisms,
and that the latter were in nowise destroyed by the heat supposed to be developed.

By many authors, e.g., Busow,§ the fact that fluid fat sometimes oozed from the
wound was taken to mean that it was melted by the heat of the bullet. This is put
forward without recognition that fluid fat always escapes from adipose tissue if this
latter be cut, lacerated, or contused. Against the view that any part of the bullet is
fused, is the incontrovertible and finally decisive fact, that fired bullets often show the
marks of the rifling of the barrel, and scratches on their surfaces as perfectly sharp.
In one case we noted, as von Beck had previously, that the bullet had enclosed a
hair in its course, which hair was quite uninjured. Finally, no part of the wound is in
the slightest degree charred, even superficially.
