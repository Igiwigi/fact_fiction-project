Their very minuteness and numbers enable these “germs” to become as ubiqui-
tous as “ Bacteria” or ordinary “ Yeast” forms, thus explaining the ubiquity of the
tubercles. Breretp has shown that the ordinary resting-spores of the Ustilaginee, which
usually take a long time to germinate in pure water, will germinate much more rapidly
in nutritive solutions, and that several species can be made to develope their promycelia
in nutritive solutions which had hitherto been cultivated in vain. The curious fact
comes out, however, that when thas germinating in nutritive solutions the promycelia
go on budding off yeast-like cells, which multiply still further by budding, and thus

extend the parasite outside the plant enormously, According to BrEFELp’s discoveries,

whereas some forms, such as Ustilago destruens,* first develope a definite mycelium
from the resting-spore, and the yeast-like cells are budded off from this into the air,
in other cases the budding commences at once on the germination of the spore. Thus,
in Ustilago antherarum,t the budding begins direct from the spore, or immediately the
promycelium is protruded.
