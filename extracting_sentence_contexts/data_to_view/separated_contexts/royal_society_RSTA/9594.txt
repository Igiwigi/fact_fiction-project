Hence the subdivisions of (¢,b) may be taken all equal, or according to any other
method, provided that the greatest of them tends to zero. Moreover, the square of

b
[| fe—gor| de

is less than

(b—a) | (fe—qsr) de,
and, therefore,
is also made arbitrarily small. -

If L is positive, then

and is also arbitrarily small. We may, in fact, say that

Pie da < aI. | fe- px | da,

dx:

[. | fe— pa | da+ [. a

is arbitrarily small. This is the property that will be immediately useful. It may be extended to an

unlimited function fz when

b cb 1
exist.
