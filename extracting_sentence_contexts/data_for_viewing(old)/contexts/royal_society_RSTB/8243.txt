The total size of the world population is likely to increase from its current 7 billion to 8-10 billion
by 2050. This uncertainty is because of unknown future fertility and mortality trends in different
parts of the world. But the young age structure of the population and the fact that in much of
Africa and Western Asia, fertility is still very high makes an increase by at least one more billion
almost certain. Virtually, all the increase will happen in the developing world. For the second
half of the century, population stabilization and the onset of a decline are likely. In addition to
the future size of the population, its distribution by age, sex, level of educational attainment and
place of residence are of specific importance for studying future food security. The paper provides
a detailed discussion of different relevant dimensions in population projections and an evaluation of
the methods and assumptions used in current global population projections and in particular those
produced by the United Nations and by IIASA.
