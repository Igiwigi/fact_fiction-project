Relative preponderance of the left ventricle is
represented by an increase in the amplitude of R in Lead J and of S in Lead J//;
while relative preponderance of the right ventricle is represented by an increase in the
amplitude of Sin Lead J and Rin Lead I//. These are the prominent signs. It is
not with this fact but with its explanation that we are concerned at present. It would seem clear that if a single ventricle becomes enlarged in all its dimensions,
the general distribution of the excitation wave throughout it will remain unaltered. But as the mass of tissue involved in the process of excitation is increased, the electric
forces liberated will suffer corresponding exaggeration.
