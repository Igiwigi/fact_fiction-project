The validity of such model has been verified
here with results clearly confirming the guess. We have also verified the space-time scaling
behaviours of both velocity and temperature fluctuations resulting from the quasi-adiabatic
scenario finding good agreement. Our theory is limited to the case with Pr ~ 1 and this choice is motivated by the fact that air
thermal diffusivity and viscosity are very close to each other. From a theoretical point of view, the
regime we have analysed is also the most rich: indeed, in this case, an inertial range of scales for
both velocity and temperature fluctuations exists, while this is not the case when Pr > 1 or Pr <1. In the former case, the scalar evolves in a smooth turbulent background without intermittency,
the so-called Batchelor regime, for which the scaling behaviour are reported in this work; in the
latter case, despite an inertial range of scales develops for the velocity fluctuations, this is not for
the scalar which exhibits a trivial bare diffusive regime.
