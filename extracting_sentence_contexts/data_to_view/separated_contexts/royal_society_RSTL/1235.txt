So that it can hardly be doubled but that some
expansion, however'small in its amount, takes place in sea water when cooled from
229 to18®, But I hope to be s0on able to repeat the experiment in a more perfect
manner, by a method similar to that employed, for an analogous object, by MM. DvLoxs and PeT1T, and described in their excellent paper on the « Mesures des
Temperatures, &c. 1818,”

It may also be objected to this experiment; that the bulb has not its interior cooled
uniformly, since the surface must be acted upon by the application of cold before the
central parts, This is true to a certain extent, But from the great slowness of the
experiment (which lasted about three hours at each time), this source of error is in a
great degree avoided ; and, that the greatest degree of cold actually reached the centre
of the_vessel, was proved by a nucleus of ice being formed” init, which 'closely 'in-
vested the bulb of the thermometer.

found frozen, and in a few minutes the maximum of expansion
is obtained. During this congelation the apparatus was never
broken, and I satisfied myself by various trials with other ves-
sels, that if a vent, however small, be allowed to sea water at
the moment of freezing, the vessel is preserved entire, which,
it is well known, scarcely ever happens in the case of com+-
mon water,*

Acsingular consequence to be drawn from-these experiments
seems to be, that, since sea water does not begin to expand
till it has been cooled below the point at which it usually
freezes, if its congelation were not retarded, it would become
solid - without undergoing any previous expansion, and the
law in question would altogether cease to exist in the case
of ea water. þ

With regard to the singular anomalies of temperature
inthe Arctic seas, which have given rise to this digression,
though some of the facts in question may now be more easily
understood, it would be premature, until the observations
have been multiplied, and the facts themselves more accu-
rately investigated, to attempt to bring them under any

* The ice thus produced, it should be remembered, is very different from that
which forms on the $urface of the ea, since the latter parts with its salt in the act
of freezing, a separation which can but very imperfectly take place in confined ves-
sels. Accordingly 1 found the ice produced in this experiment soft and compressible
like the water-ice of confectioners. With regard to the quantity of expansion which sea water undergoes, in confined
vessels, at the moment of freezing, I have been able to estimate it with ease, and with
rufficient accuracy, by freezing a known weight of water in a phial, connected with
an open tube, and ascertaining exactly the proportion of water forced into the tube
during congelation.
