terminals corresponding to the primary of M, are in series with the current terminals
of r (which is mounted on the panel), the current supply, and the primary winding
of the zero adjuster. Those corresponding to the primary of Mg, are in series with
the detector, and the potential terminals of S, 7, and the zero adjuster. The zero
adjuster itself is mounted under the panel roughly coaxial with Mj, and the operating

handle and the potential terminals are brought to the top of the panel. Along the
front edge of the panel is arranged a bank of telephone keys, controlling the various
circuits. Fig. 9 shows diagrammatically the arrangement of the circuits and, as far
as is consistent with the limitations of the drawing, those leads which are in fact
twisted closely together are shown side by side. The internal circuits of S and of
the zero adjuster are, for simplicity, shown purely formally in this figure.

The whole assembly is immersed in a stoneware tank containing transformer oil,
so that all the inductive coils and resistances are protected from the atmosphere
and are maintained at a uniform temperature. The material of which the tank
was made was non-magnetic, although, since all the inductances in the bridge
were measured in sifu against the primary standard, this requirement is by no means
so critical here as for materials used in the immediate neighbourhood of the primary
standard itself.

The earthing arms used for the main bridge and the mutual inductance com-
