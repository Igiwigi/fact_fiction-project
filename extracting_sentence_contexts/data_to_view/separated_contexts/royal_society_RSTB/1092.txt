Photograph of a transverse section of the fresh spinal cord (Cat) at the 7th dorsal nerve, slightly
magnified. The remarkable differentiation of the posterior columns in this animal (Scuirr) is
well seen. That these measures were effectual in localising the stimulus was demonstrated by
the fact that the placing of the electrodes on the neighbouring sections of the grey
columns evoked no electrical changes, as evidenced in the galvanometer connected
either with the issuing nerves or with another portion of the cord; so that the

positive electrical results following stimulation of a column, the posterior, for instance,
were to be attributed entirely to the localised stimulation of the structures upon which
the points of the electrodes rested. A further point is the special difficulty of maintaining the electrodes properly in
position, #.e., in contact with the cord, inasmuch as the spinal muscles on their
contraction shake the cord a little, although the spine be fixed. This, of course,
applies only to the end excited.
