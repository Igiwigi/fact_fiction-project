Red, orange, green,
blue-green, and pale shades of these colours, appeared normal; so did the same colours
mixed with black. Yellow was extremely pale; blue was dark blue-grey; mauve was red-
brown; and crimson was replaced by orange. At the time, these facts seemed extremely
puzzling. Now, however, that the details of the reduced colour vision which the retina
assumes under conditions of small visual angle, or of feeble illumination, are known, the
properties of this light are much more easily understood. (69)
