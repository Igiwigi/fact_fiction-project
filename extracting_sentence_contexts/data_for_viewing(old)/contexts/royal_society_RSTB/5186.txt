These spots are very fine and cover the whole background. Again the dise in all three
cases is a little below and behind the optic axis, and is long and narrow, the long axis
being directed downwards. In Sphenodon its length is double that of its breadth, which
latter is about a third that of the human dise. The disc itself is white in all these animals,
and its margin nearly obscured by an immense number of opaque nerve fibres, which
radiate outwards in all directions, and extend laterally for a considerable distance, to
the periphery. Hence in the colour of the fundus, the gold mottling, the white disc
covered with white nerve fibres, together with an absence of all trace of a pecten, the
eye of the Sphenodon bears a striking resemblance to the toad’s fundus. The one great
difference lies in the fact that in the Sphenodon there are no blood vessels to be seen
anywhere, which in all Anura form so prominent a feature in the hyaloid.

In the Echidna we find fewer opaque nerve fibres, and the fundus has a uniform
lilae-red colour without any stippling, otherwise they are much alike. Thus the lowest
living Reptile (nearest the level whence the Mammals have sprung from the hypothetical
tree) bears a striking resemblance to the lowest living Mammal, whilst the other recent
Reptiles reveal themselves as further developed side branches. It is just as, or rather
better than, the phylogenist dared expect.

Briefly, the following are the main differences seen in the fundi of the various orders
and families of the Reptiles :—
