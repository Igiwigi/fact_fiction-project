tissues of the thymic lobule.

amount of connective tissue continuous with the capsule of the gland. The enlargement
(Plate 1, fig. 2, ¢.c.) is very irregular in shape and penetrates the substance of the thymus
for some little distance, forming a branching sac from whose deep surface strands of
connective tissue riddled with cleft-like spaces pass up into the mass of the gland and
become continuous with the trabecular framework connected with the capsule that
separates the thymie tissue into lobules and supports it. The sac and its associated
connective tissue form, in fact, a sort of hylum, or focus, upon which the interlobular
trabecule in the neighbourhood converge.

The spaces within this mass of connective tissue appear to be of different kinds :
some are continuous with the thymic lobules and with the cavity of the sac-like termina-
tion of the pharyngeal tube ; others are lined by an endothelium and apparently are
lymphatic spaces connected with the circum-thymic lymph sinus; others are blood-
vessels.

As the terminal sac of the pharyngeal tube breaks up within this mass of connective
tissue, its epithelium opens out, the polygonal cells, growing smaller and stellate, merge
into the small stellate cells of the thymic reticulum (Plate 1, fig. 3, ér.c., r.c.) and their
interspaces become to some extent infiltrated by leucocytes. In the meshes of the network
