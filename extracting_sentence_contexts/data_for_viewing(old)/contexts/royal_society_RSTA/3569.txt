As formulated in equation (3.2), investment costs include terms related to new conventional
and renewable generation, new lines, new storage plants and new FACTS devices (shown in this
order in equation (3.2)). Equation (3.3) models the fuel costs of thermal power units across all time
periods.

As per equations (3.4) and (3.5), we assume that investments are irreversible and that some of
them feature a lag of one epoch (i.e. several years) between decision and commissioning times,
respectively. Note that equation (3.5) constrains some investment decisions to be equal among
sibling nodes, which is caused by the above-mentioned one-epoch lag. Owing to their prolonged
