The avidity with which the
oxide of tetrethylphosphonium attracts both water and carbonic acid, has prevented
us from analysing this body, but its formation, the composition of the corresponding
iodide, and the analysis of a platinum- and gold-salt, hereafter to be mentioned, suffi-
ciently warrant the formula
C,, Hs, PO,=E, PO, HO. In its deportment with other substances the body in question resembles the oxide of
tetrethylammonium ; we refer therefore to the detailed description which one of us has
given of this compound in a former memoir*. The solution of the oxide of tetrethy]-
phosphonium shows in fact all the reactions of a solution of potassa; the precipitates,
such as alumina and protoxide of zinc, dissolve, however, less readily in excess of the
phosphorus-compound. The action of heat upon this body gives rise to a peculiar
transformation, to which we shall return hereafter. Tetrethylphosphonium produces crystallizable salts with hydrochloric, nitric, and sul-
phuric acids.
