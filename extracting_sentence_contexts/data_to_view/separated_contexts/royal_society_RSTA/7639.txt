Finally, in xenon the 6d and 5p groups are overlapping. The 6d, starts upward, but
on approaching the 5, level—now above it—is repelled downward. This series of
observations offers a further illustration of the fact that the Stark effect is not deter-
mined by the type of level alone. The reversal of a term may be shown in a relatively simple theoretical case. In
fig. 6 the terms 5 (P, D, F, G) with m = 1 have been given separations 30, 10, and
1 cm. '' respectively.
