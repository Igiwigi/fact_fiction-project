Spawning seldom or never takes place by the act of the species until each sex has
attained its full maturity of function. The eggs are sometimes voluntarily retained
by the female Frog, for several hours or days within the uteri, although arrived at
maturity, if the proper evolution of spermatozoa in the male be not completed. I
have had evidence of this in the fact, that when the union of the sexes has been of
long continuance, the female has sometimes passed a very few ova, and then has con-
tinued without further oviposition for many hours, sometimes for a day or two,
before the mass was expelled, and the function of the sexes consummated. These first
extruded eggs have almost always been found to be unimpregnated. When the eggs have been deposited, the cireumstances which affect their fecunda-
