The temperature of the peritectic or eutectic horizontal was determined as lying
between 606° and 625°, by quenching alloys in the two-phase area. It will be seen
that the system is remarkable for the relatively steep fall in the solidus as compared
with the corresponding lines in the systems silver-indium, silver-aluminium, and copper-
gallium. Reference to the collected tables will show that the solidus depression is, in
fact, almost exactly equal to that of the normal 4-valent system silver-tin. The Solubility Curve. Table XXXIV gives the results of the experiments for the determination of the
solubility curve, and is self-explanatory except for the following points: Alloy 18-86.
