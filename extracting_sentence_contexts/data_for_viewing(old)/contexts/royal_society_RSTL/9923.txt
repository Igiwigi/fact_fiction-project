more taken up with ammonia than without it over the eight years of the application of
the dung, but rather less subsequently, and oyer the 20 years all but identical amounts
on both plots.

It is obvious that the increased amounts of lime and magnesia, of potass and soda,
and of phosphoric acid, taken up under the influence of the ammonia-salts, must have
had their source in the previous supplies within the soil, or in the residue from the
farmyard manure ; and, 80 far, the action of the ammonia-salts has been more rapidly
to utilize, and therefore the more to exhaust, these otherwise dormant stores. Bat,
from the very slight increase in the amount of potass taken up, and the very much
greater increase in that of soda, ib may be concluded that there was a relative deficiency
of available potass within the soil, notwithstanding the comparatively large amount
probably supplied in the dung; in fact, the increased yield of potass over that without
manure amounted, on both plots, to only about half that estimated to be supplied, It
would appear that the residue of the potass of the dung, which we know to be but
little subject to drainage, was nevertheless but slowly available to the succeeding crops.
Of phosphorie acid, again, there was very much less increased amount taken up under
the influence of the ammonia-salts than there was of either sulpharic acid or chlorine,
both of which were s0 liberally supplied. It was probable that, of both the potass and
the phosphorie acid supplied in the dung, part remains unliberated from its original
condition of combination in the manure, and part becomes 80 locked up (or distributed)
within the 80il, as to be only very slowly available.

Of nitrogen, there was a somewhab higher percentage in the dry substance of the
produce with, than in that without, the application of ammonia-salts, but still less than
