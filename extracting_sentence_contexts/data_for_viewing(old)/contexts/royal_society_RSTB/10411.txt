and thus some of the crucial features of a standard neural net-
work are not present in the swarm. Is the fluid state a constraint
for developing more complex cognitive capacities? Are ‘solid’
and ‘fluid’ neural systems the only two solutions available?
Future work might shed some light on the invention of eusoci-
ality [203] and the implications for defining universality classes
of cognitive complexity.

9. Synthetic languages

The transition towards a complex language is a recent one
and had an enormous relevance to human evolution. It is
also a hard problem [204]. One of the obvious facts is the gap
between the complexity of human language and any other
known biological communication system. The gap is due to
the presence of a grammar that allows the generation of recur-
sive structures of potentially infinite complexity [1,205].
Another crucial observation concerns language acquisition
in children. Around 2 years of age, the sequence of utterances
babbling-one word—words is replaced by full sentences [206]
and children develop grammatical competence, suggesting
that this is an indication of an innate capacity of language
[207,208]. Grammar effectively defines the mapping between
linguistic forms and meanings. In its original formulation,
Chomsky introduced the concept of universal grammar (UG)
