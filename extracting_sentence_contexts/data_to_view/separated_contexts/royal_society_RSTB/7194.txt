That evidence, which consisted of notes, reference cards and reprints, was destroyed
by fire when incendiary bombs were dropped on the City of London in 1942. The evidence
thus having been destroyed, all that remain are recollections of a few experimenters and
their more important conclusions. While it is justifiable to state, in general terms, that the spectral colours can be matched
by suitable mixtures of red, green and blue monochromatic lights, in fact the matches
thus made are far from perfect, because, in nearly every case, the monochromatic light is

noticeably more homogeneous, that is, it contains less white light, than the mixture. This
imperfect matching is usually expressed in colour-mixture equations by giving negative
values to one of the component colours: to blue, when the yellow and orange parts of the
spectrum are being matched; to red, when the blue-green is concerned; to green, for both
the blue-violet and the red spectral regions. The magnitude of the negative values in these
four parts of the spectrum depend on the wave-length of the rays which have been selected
by the experimenter for making his colour mixtures.
