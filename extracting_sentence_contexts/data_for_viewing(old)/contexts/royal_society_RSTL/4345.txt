308 MR. GLAISHER ON THE THERMOMETRICAL OBSERVATIONS

same times, I determined two mean values, the one from the morning observations,
and the other from the afternoon observations, and compared the difference between
them, with the difference as exhibited in my tables; in nearly all cases the values
thus found were nearly alike; hence it appeared that the corrections apply equally
well to all the years since 1774.

Having ascertained this fact, I felt I had the means, to a certain extent, of deter-
mining the quality of the instruments which have been used, as, for the most part,
different instruments were used in the morning and in the afternoon observations,
and also the correctness of the observations generally ; and thus the means of ascer-
taining the value of the results which could be deduced from them.

I need not mention all the tests to which I have subjected the observations, but
briefly state that the results were, a conviction on my mind that the instruments had
been uniformly good, that the observations had been faithfully recorded as read from
the instruments, and that very great care had been taken in reading at the times
stated ; the latter circumstance was most satisfactorily proved from the fact of the
results being the Â«ame when the times of observation have been such that the changes
were rapid, and consequently a small error in the time of reading would have entailed
