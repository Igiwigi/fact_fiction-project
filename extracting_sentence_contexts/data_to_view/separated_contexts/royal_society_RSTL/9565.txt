Since this paper was sent in there has been a note publithed by MM. Gepprs et
Bepparp in *Comptes Rendus? (tom. xcii., pp. 308-10) on the histology of the muscular
þ tissues of Echinoderms. According to the observations of these authors the conflicting
; views of previous observers on the question whether the muscvlar fibres of Echinoderms
are striated or unstriated, admit of being reconciled by the fact that the same muscle
h fibres are xometimes unstriated and at other times appear to be striated.

_ (Sphorechinus granularis) where 8uch a discharge was found by him to be very copious.
