on the importance of abiotic versus biotic factors explaining incorporating traits of the leaf and wood economics spectra;
range limits revealed that the warm end was indeed about see [27]). Candidate traits may then be screened for relevance

equally often explained by abiotic/temperature and biotic by studying trait clines across populations (or species) along


the gradient. In fact, many trade-offs reported in table 1 have
only been studied on this level so far. There is an important
caveat to such clinal studies; comparisons should focus
a priori on differences from the centre to each of the edges,
and not from edge to edge. The studies listed in table 1
showed that different trade-offs may be relevant at different
range edges. Therefore, reference populations should be
those towards the range centres.

In such studies of screening of candidates, care should be
taken to details of assessment. Speed of growth and develop-
ment and resistance traits seem to be regularly involved in
trade-offs and may be detected more often if assessed care-
