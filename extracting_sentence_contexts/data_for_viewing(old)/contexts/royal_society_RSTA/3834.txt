In what follows, we consider ourselves to be in an inertial frame of reference, adopting a right-
handed Cartesian coordinate system x,y,z with time t. Indices taken from the start of the Roman
alphabet (a,b,c, ...) may take on the values x, y or z and a double appearance of an index implies
summation over x, y and z. We take a microscopic view, focusing upon freely propagating light or
the interaction of this light with individual molecules. We work within the semiclassical domain,
where the electromagnetic field is treated classically and everything else is treated quantum
mechanically [37].

2. The angular momentum of light

It is now well established that light carries spin and also orbital angular momentum [38-41].

Less widely appreciated at present, however, is the fact that these are but two of many angular : 2
momenta carried by light, in the sense that there are many rotational symmetries inherent : >
to Maxwell’s equations. In this section, we give a brief overview of the basic description in : §
fundamental electromagnetic theory of the angular momentum of light, in particular, those Los
facets of it that may not be familiar to the reader but nevertheless take centre stage in the context : ~
of the chiral light-matter interactions discussed in the following section. We work here in a system [oS
of units with «9 = 49 =C=1. : Sg

There has been much controversy in the past over what constitutes a ‘true’ angular : iS
momentum. We argue that an angular momentum is, fundamentally, a property of a system : g
with the dimensions of an angular momentum, the conservation of which is associated with £8

a rotational symmetry according to Noether’s theorem [42-46]. An angular momentum in this
