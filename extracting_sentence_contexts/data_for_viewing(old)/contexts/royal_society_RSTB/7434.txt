reason whatever to suppose that there has been a secondary loss of yolk’ in P. capensis and in
Paraperipatus novae-britanniae, but he obtained no clear details of either segmentation of germ-
layer formation, and had in fact no data with which to uphold his views. Bouvier had no
embryological evidence of his own. His views are discussed on p. 538.

Differences in segmentation, germ-layer formation, yolk sac, etc., occurring in the several
Species of Peripatopsis, and their bearing upon evolution within the Onychophora

The state of the literature on onychophoran development has given the impression that
there is wide variation in ontogeny within the group, and ‘in extreme cases the assembling
of the germ layers seems to be almost haphazard’ and ‘it would appear that the manner of
development has little significance’ (Snodgrass 1938). I am in disagreement with both
these statements. On the contrary, when facts are sifted from fiction, there is extraordinary
uniformity in the essential processes of development, in spite of the enormous variations in
the amounts of yolk present in the eggs of different species, and the manner of development
has considerable significance.

Segmentation and germ-layer formation

A basic similarity in development is shown by the species of Peripatopsis, but the variations in
segmentation and germ-layer formation found within the same genus are remarkable. Early
segmentation appears to be essentially similar in the four described species. In later stages
large vacuolated cells are formed from the edges of the disk of blastomeres in P. balfouri and
P. capensis but not in P. moseleyi or P. sedgwicki. In the two former species the vacuolated
cells become internal in a comparable manner, in P. capensis forming a hollow gastrula
