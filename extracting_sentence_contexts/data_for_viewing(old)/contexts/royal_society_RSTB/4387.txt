right ventral pancreas have both lost their simple tubular character at the time when
fusion occurs between them, and, although the left ventral pancreas at this stage
only shows the slightest indications of branching, by the time that it fuses with the
dorsal primordium, it, too, is typically branched.

Fusion, it must be borne in mind, takes place not between the respective ducts of
the three primordia, but between actual branched pancreatic tissue. It is true that
the branched pancreatic tissue encircling the left aspect of the portal vein is derived
from the original dorsal pancreatic duct, but its duct-like structure has entirely
disappeared by the time that fusion occurs between it and the two ventral primordia.

In dealing with the origin and fate of the dorsal pancreatic duct (ante, p. 315),
attention was called to the fact that the duct exhibits a remarkable variability.
inasmuch as it may either persist until late in foetal life or undergo complete
degeneration at a much earlier stage. The duct, when persistent, opens inde-
pendently into the left dorso-lateral border of the duodenum, removed some little
distance from the common bile duct opening. The ventral pancreatic duct, on the
contrary, invariably persists. It never at any time opens directly into the duodenum,
but only vid the ductus choledochus.

That part of the dorsal pancreatic duct which persists to open into the duodenum
is derived from the most proximal region of the original duct (cf text-fig. 10,
d.p.d.(p.)). in other words, from the proximal region of the primary outgrowth
from the dorsal wall of the duodenum. The remainder of the original duct, as
already stated (ante, p. 318), undergoes a marked branching, and becomes indis-
