tions in either position of the pendulum, might have been
double this quantity, and yet when the great weight was
below, not have differed from the truth more than 0, of a
vibration.

It appears then, that if the experiments have been con-
ducted with sufficient care, no greater difference should be
found between the mean, and any one of the resulting lengths
of the pendulum contained in the preceding table, than might
have been occasioned by a difference of 0,30 f a vibration in
24 hours, and this is found to be about 0,000g of an inch.

In fact, on referring to the table we perceive that the expe-
riments A and D, which differ most from the mean, give, the
one, 00029 of an inch zz excess, and the other ,00026 in defect.

In considering the sources of error, it may not be unneces-
ary to remark that had the bar of the pendulum been made
too thick, and the knife edges not been placed accurately at
right angles to it, an error, though very minute, might have
arisen from the effect of the obliquity in diminishing the dis-
