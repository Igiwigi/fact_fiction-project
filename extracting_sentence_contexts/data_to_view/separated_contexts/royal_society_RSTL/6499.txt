It will here be sufficient for my purpose
to state the results, and, for the analytical solution, to refer the reader to the volume of
the Cambridge Transactions above quoted. The results are as follows :—

%, 3, and 4, being the angles which define the position of the small plane s (art. 13),
the analytical conditions for the tangential force (T, or p sin >) upon it being a maxi-
mum or minimum, are satisfied by the following three systems of contemporaneous
values :— p
(1) «,=90, A,=z=+48,

(2) Þ,=90, oj === 10, Ns (d.)

and if T,, T,, and T, be the values of T corresponding respectively to these systems of
values of «,, 3,, and y,, we have

N=HKB, —0CY, T=HA,—C,Y, T;=HA;—B,Y-

If A,, B,, C, be taken, as they always may be, in order of magnitude, T, will mani-
festly be the greatest of these values of T. It is in fact, as shown in the memoir
referred to, the only value which satisfies all the conditions of a maximum. The corre-
sponding values of «,, 3, and y,, which determine the corresponding position of the
plane s, are those given by the second system of (4.). Now Þ, is the angle between the
normal to s and the axis of y; and since it is here =90s, the normal to 8 mnst lie in
the plane of &z, and the plane s itself must pass through the axis of y.
