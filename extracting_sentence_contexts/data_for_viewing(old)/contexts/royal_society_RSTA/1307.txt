interactions may be reduced to interactions among surface elements of spheres (see a discussion
about the Derjaguin approximation in [1]). Derjaguin stated also [7] that the virtual work done
by the external load during adhesive contact is equal to the sum of the virtual change of the
potential elastic energy and the virtual work that is consumed by the increase of the surface
attractions. Unfortunately, the paper contains some erroneous assumptions and miscalculations.
Nevertheless, using Derjaguin’s results, Sperling in his PhD thesis [8] derived the force—
displacement diagram for a sticky sphere and analysed the critical points of the curve. Sperling
was not aware of Johnson’s [9] suggestion to use the stress superposition to estimate the influence
of adhesive forces. Like Derjaguin’s paper, Johnson's paper was brilliant but contained a wrong
statement that the adhesive interactions should be neglected. Independently of Sperling, Johnson
et al. [10] presented the JKR (Johnson, Kendall and Roberts) theory that united the Derjauguin
energy approach and Johnson’s idea of stress fields superposition (see a discussion by Kendall
[11]). In fact, it was shown that a solution to the adhesive contact problem may be derived using
superposition of two non-adhesive frictionless contact problems: the Hertz solution for contact
between elastic spheres and the Boussinesq solution for a flat-ended cylindrical punch. This
approach to adhesive contact problems will be referred to further as the JKR formalism. Owing
to its simplicity and elegance, the JKR approach is very popular, and it has been referenced in the
literature thousands of times [12].

The JKR formalism was employed to solve problems of adhesive contact between power-law
shaped solids independently by Galanov [13] (see also [14]) for an arbitrary d > 1 and Carpick
et al. [15] for d = 2n (see a discussion by Borodich [5]). Later Borodich and his co-workers extended
the JKR formalism to arbitrary blunt axisymmetric indenters and to materials having rotational
symmetry like transversely isotropic or homogeneously prestressed materials [1,16,17]. It was
shown by Borodich [1] that using the JKR formalism along with the Griffith idea of equating
