THEORY OF THE PARTITIONS OF NUMBERS. 99

Art. 22. It is not, I think, immediately obvious that this series can be effectively
summed. That this is, in fact, the case appears when the problem is looked at fron
another point of view. I shall show that

see (n+1)(n+2)...(n+m)_ (mn+1),
Peete ie a)
for suppose that the permutation

Cp ees, . ig | ces" Meet, , ce toi

gives rise to the term x™, where (/yhy...k,,) is a one-row partition of 3k. The part to
the left of the dividing line may be as small as «,«,, and the part to the right as small
aS 4,4; hence Sk has values ranging from 2 to mn—2; the partition (kyh,...k,,) has
parts limited in magnitude to n and in number to m; and if there were no deductions
from the total of partitions the value of L, (, m, 2) would be

(n+1) (n+2) .. -(n+m) ,
(1) (2) ... (m)

but there must be deductions, because every partition of the form n'j must be absent ;
for the corresponding succession of letters is

n n n .
