accessible to the analysts [28]. Hence, the CCRA2 approach had to strike a careful balance between


pragmatism (i.e. working with what is available), technical rigour and feasibility, given the dual Lo |
constraints of insufficient data and limited resources for additional analysis.

A key methodological development, which emerged in the scientific community in relation _
to climate change risk assessment between CCRA and CCRA2, was arguably the development :
of the new narrative scenario framework which combines climate change future, quantified
in terms of combinations of representative concentration pathways (time series of greenhouse
gas concentrations in the atmosphere [29]) with socioeconomic narratives, quantified as shared
socioeconomic pathways [30]. This is a very useful analytical framework, but it was not possible
to incorporate this in CCRA2 due to the fact that the latter methodology is based on literature
review rather than use of a top-down, harmonized scenario framework, partly due to budgetary
constraints. Another development was an increased focus in the literature on low-emission a)
scenarios, providing additional information about the risks associated with lower levels of :
global warming of 1.5-2Â°C above pre-industrial levels. This type of work has led to increasing :=
discussions of the relationship between mitigation and adaptation and how this might affect the :3
level of future risk. As this work was at a very early stage in CCRA2, much of this literature could :
not be reflected in the report. DB

The CCRA2 adopted a new comprehensive three-step methodology for analysing the priorities :s
for adaptation actions based on climate risks, instead of applying a harmonized, top-down um
