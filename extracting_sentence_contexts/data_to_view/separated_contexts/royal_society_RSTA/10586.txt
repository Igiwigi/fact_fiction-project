5, Lhe fact thus brought out, that the convection is a maximum in carbon dioxide
“and a minimum in hydrogen,* may cause some surprise, for the coefficient of vis-
Stosity of the former is only half that of the latter. It must, however, be remembered
“hat the force causing convection is the buoyancy of the heated gas which is propor-
tional to its density. The heat conveyed by the stream of gas is proportional to
the volume of the gas in motion, its mean rise of temperature, its mean velocity,
Bits specific heat, and its density ; thus we have for a given temperaturet

a Convection = A go i

ew here A = a constant, p = the density of the gas, C = the specific heat, y = the
‘Bviscosity.

4 According to the above formula, the relative convection in carbon dioxide, oxygen,
Suir, and hydrogen is represented by the numbers 20, 8°6, 8°5, and 1:2.
