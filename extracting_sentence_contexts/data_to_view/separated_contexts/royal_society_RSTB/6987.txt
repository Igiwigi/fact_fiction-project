In the following spring the relative lack
of gonad growth in the first-year birds of many species results in the failure of these birds

to undertake the spring migration. Birds such as the purple sandpiper (Erolia m. maritima
Briinnich) often remain in their winter quarters until the spring of their second year of life
(Bullough 19426). It is also possible on the theory of the determination of behaviour by the sex hormones
to suggest an explanation for several peculiar facts about the activities of young birds in
their first summer. As in juvenile starlings, it may be a common feature for these young
birds just off the nests to have relatively active gonads, and the secretion of sex hormones
by these gonads may account for the sexual behaviour of juvenile birds which has frequently
been described. Young swallows (Hirundo r. rustica L.) of the first brood may help to feed
the second brood (White 1941; Williamson 1941).
