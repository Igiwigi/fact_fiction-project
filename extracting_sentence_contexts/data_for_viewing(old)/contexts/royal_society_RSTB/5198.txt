creases as the cube of the linear dimensions, whereas surface increases only as the square ;
so that the surface of the air-chamber, which is the medium of respiratory exchange,
must be increased by means of folds in order to keep pace with the still more rapidly
increasing volume of the fish.

The Bionomics of Amphipnous cuchia (Ham. Buca).

Amphipmous cuchia is the so-called Cuchia “eel” of India. It is a member of the
order Symbranchii, and is devoid of an air-bladder and of pectoral fins, and both
opercular openings are united so as to form a single crescentic mid-ventral aperture.

Its skin is kept moist by the secretion of abundant unicellular glands ; it appears
to be naked, but close inspection reveals the fact that there are in it a multitude of
minute cycloid scales. It spends the greater part of its life out of water, wriggling
along the muddy banks of rivers and ponds ; it is also found in grassy meadows and in
muddy places among the roots of bushes. When the dry season approaches it burrows
in the banks of streams, and here male and female pass the summer together in the same
burrow. It visits the water in pursuit of food, which consists of worms, crustacea and
small mollusca.

Amphipnous cuchia has developed a pair of air-chambers (¢/. text-fig. 3 A, A.C.) as
outgrowths of the pharynx, similar to the air-chambers of the Ophiocephalide ; its gills
have undergone great reduction, being represented by a few filaments (text-fig. 3 C)
borne on the second gill arch only, so that it has almost lost the power of aquatic respira-
tion, ‘The young fry have five branchial arches, but these bear no gill filaments ; the
