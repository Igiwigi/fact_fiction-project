improbable that the fainter lines would reveal their presence in any photographs of
the solar spectrum now available. Yet some of these faint magnesium hydride lines
appear to be identical with band lines then supposed by Hate and ApAms to
correspond with solar lines.

The chief difficulty in arriving at a satisfactory conclusion on this point arises from
the fact that there are so many lines in the magnesium hydride spectrum and in the
solar spectrum that numerous chance coincidences might be expected even if there
were no real relation between the two. The application of the theory of probabilities
is somewhat uncertain, and an attempt has therefore been made to obtain further
light on the subject by comparing the relative numbers of coincidences of strong and
faint lines of magnesium hydride with the solar lines. To allow for possible errors in
the two sets of measurements, and for the fact that Row1ann’s standards have not
