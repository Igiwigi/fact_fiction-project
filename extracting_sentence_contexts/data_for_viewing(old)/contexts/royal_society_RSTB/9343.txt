essential (apply to all experiences), complete (include all the
essential properties shared by every experience), consistent
(lack contradictions) and independent (not derivable from
each other). Whether the current set of five axioms are truly
valid, complete and independent remains open.” The five
axioms are intrinsic existence, composition, information, i-
ntegration and exclusion.

(i) Intrinsic existence

Consciousness exists: my experience just is. Indeed, that my
experience here and now exists—it is real or actual—is the
only fact lam immediately and absolutely sure of, as Descartes
realized four centuries ago. Moreover, my experience exists from
its own intrinsic perspective, independent of external observers.

(ii) Composition
Consciousness is structured: each experience is composed of
many phenomenological distinctions, elementary or higher order,

Axioms. Properties of consciousness that are taken as self-evident. The only truths that, with Descartes, cannot be doubted and do not need proof. They
are intrinsic existence, composition, information, integration and exclusion (figure 3, left).
