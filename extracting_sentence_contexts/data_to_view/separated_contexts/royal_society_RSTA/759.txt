It follows that

jo) Pat any point E’ within A (0’). In fact, if the expression in the left-hand side of
(111) were not zero, then, owing to the continuity of f’ (E|0), for sufficiently small
values of A0, the expression in brackets in (110) would not be zero and would have
a constant sign. As A@ may be both positive and negative, the inequality ( 110)
would not be satisfied. Using the inequality (106) holding good at any point
outside A (0’) and repeating the above argument, we could easily find that (111)
must hold good also outside A (6’) and therefore in the whole sample space Ww.
