Counting curves

Our first example comes from enumerative geometry, a particularly active field
in the nineteenth century. In classical geometry many problems concern counting
the number of solutions. Starting with the fact that two straight lines in the plane
meet in one point (which may be at infinity, in which case the lines are parallel),
one goes on to show that curves in the plane given by polynomial equations of
degrees m and n meet in mn points, provided we allow complex solutions, points
at infinity and count intersections with multiplicity. A slightly more complicated problem is to count the number of curves in the
plane that satisfy certain constraints. One such problem for curves of degree d,
which are rational, i.e. can be described parametrically by rational functions of
one complex variable, is to ask how many such curves go through n general points.
