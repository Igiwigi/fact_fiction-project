In cases where extreme bending
of the specimen was carried out, initial failures and buckling of the fibres and
tracheides took place. Even where only the very slightest permanent bowing was
produced, it was possible to demonstrate planes of slipping in the cell-walls in the
middle part of the specimen. The facts for Ash and for Spruce, permanently deformed
after soaking in warm water or steaming, are thus in entire agreement with those
-obtained in the compression failures of these-woods in the air-dried condition. Fractures IN LonNGItupINAL TENSION. The gross features of the tension fractures of a number of woods, including Oak
and Ash, have been described and figured by Fuuron (Joe. cit.).
