3-2. General scheme of analysis

It was at once apparent that the fluctuations on any record contained components of
a wide range of periods. In the analysis of previous observations (Bowden & Proudman
1949), a method of graphical smoothing was used to separate fluctuations with periods of
the order of a few seconds from those with periods greater than about 30s. While this
procedure appeared justified in an exploratory survey of the fluctuations, it has not been
repeated with the present series of records. There is, in fact, no advantage in attempting
such a separation unless (a) there is internal evidence that the spectrum of the fluctuations
contains two or more distinct bands of periods, or (b) there are believed to exist two or more
different physical processes which are likely to be associated with current fluctuations in
different frequency bands. Both (a) and (b) have been reconsidered in the course of the
analysis, but no convincing evidence has been forthcoming under either heading. On the
other hand, methods of smoothing have the disadvantage that they may introduce a
spurious periodicity into the fluctuations.

In the present analysis, the mean values of the turbulent velocities and the auto-correla-
tion coefficients have been determined without any initial separation of fluctuations of
different periods. A system of numerical smoothing was introduced at a later stage in the
examination of distance-correlations.
