length and half an inch in thickness, was treated in the same
way as the medium of communication between muriate of
barytes and distilled water. The first products were soda,
ammonia, and lime; and after an hour and a quarter, the
barytes was very evident. There was much free oxymuriatic
acid in the positively electrified tube, but no particle of
muriatic acid had passed into the negative tube, either from
the muriatic solution or from the muscular fibre.

VI. Some general Observations on these Phenomena, and on the
Mode of Decomposition and Transition.

It will be a general expression of the facts that have been
detailed, relating to the changes and transitions by electricity,
in common philosophical language, to say, that hydrogene,
the alkaline substances, the metals, and certain metallic oxides,
are attracted by negatively electrified metallic surfaces, and
repelled by positively electrified metallic surfaces ; and con-


chemical Agencies of Electricity. 29

trariwise, that oxygene‚Äù and acid substances are attracted by
positively electrified metallic surfaces, and repelled by nega-
tively electrified metallic surfaces; and these attractive and re-
