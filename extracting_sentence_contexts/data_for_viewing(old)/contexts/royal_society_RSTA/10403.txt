Yellow, d= 48 centim., nearly.
Red, d=1'19 centims. ,,

Since the latter number is greater than the former, it follows that this glass, and

indeed all gold glasses for which our condition is satisfied, should be much more red
than yellow. Presumably, therefore, they are still more yellow than green, and more
green than blue.* We should therefore expect the gold glasses F, G, H, which
satisfy our condition, to be red, as in fact they are.

The above values for d are certainly of the right order, but they may be somewhat
too large. If we had taken the value of p, called the Total Gold Content in Table IL.,
the corresponding values of d would have been only half those given above.

It is to be remembered that manufacturers, in making gold ruby glass for “ flashing ”
on to clear glass, use much more gold. A common value for the total gold content is
about: 3.1075. :

By means of equation (15) and Table I. we can in this way predict whether a gold,
silver, or copper glass for which v = 1°56 will transmit more red or more yellow light,
and whether such a glass containing small spheres of “ potassium-sodium” will
