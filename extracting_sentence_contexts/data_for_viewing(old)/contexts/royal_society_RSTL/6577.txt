increase on treadwheel days ; but the general results in the other cases were varied
only 80 far as that the effect of the treadwheel was less on the short than on the long
average.

The average amount of urea excreted daily to each pound weight of the body is as
follows; and for comparison I have added the proportion in myself.

The foregoing facts prove that, whilst there is no average increase in the elimination
of urea during the period of actual treadwheel labour without food, there is a small
increase in the production on the whole day when ordinary food is taken ; but on some
occasions this increase is not eliminated on the day of labour, but on the following one
of rest. The proportion of urea to the weight of the body on the whole period of
labour and rest combined, is 59 per cent. greater than is observed in myself with much
greater weight, less food, and less labour.

Rrvoren found that during fasting there was an increase in the solids in the urine
emitted, on the increasing weights of the men ; but BexEks and others haye shown that,
whilst there may be this general relation, there is much diversity in the results. More-
over, since in one person the bones, and in another the fat, may be relatively heavier
than the muscle in a third, and since in relation to body weight the amount of food
