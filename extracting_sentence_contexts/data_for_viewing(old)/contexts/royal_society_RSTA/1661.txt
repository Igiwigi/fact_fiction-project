more technicalities and far fewer examples than in the Hilbert setting, and in this short survey,
we have not room to give details, so we only briefly list some extensions of the results of §4 to the
Banach case.

2. Preliminaries

Throughout this article, X is a separable real Banach space, with norm || - ||. 8,(X), C,(X) and
BUC(X) denote the spaces of Borel measurable, continuous, uniformly continuous and bounded
functions from X to R, respectively, endowed with the sup norm || - ||oo. Occasionally, we will be
concerned also with the mixed topology in C;(X), which is the finest locally convex topology that
agrees on every bounded set in C,(X) with the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets.
As we are concerned with Gaussian measures on X and the relative Cameron—Martin Hilbert
space H C X is separable, we state the standing assumption that X itself is separable: in fact,
Gaussian measures are always concentrated on the closure of H in X. See §2d.

If Y is any Banach space, -/(X, Y) is the space of linear bounded operators from X to Y; as
usual, if Y = X, it is denoted by “(X), and if X = R, it is denoted by X*. For2 <heN, LI(X) is the
space of continuous h-linear operators from X" to R.

The Borel o-algebra B(X) coincides with the o-algebra &(X) generated by the cylindrical sets,
ie., the sets of the form C = {x € X: (f,(x),...,fn(x)) € Co}, where fi,...,fn € X* and Co € B(R"), see
e.g. [3, Ch. 1]. Accordingly, a function f : X > R is called cylindrical if there are f,,...,fn € X* and
g:R" > Rsuch that f(x) = g(f1(%),.. -,fn(x)).

If X is a Hilbert space, we denote by (.,-) its inner product. (X) and 2(X) denote the
