Because the light originated so
early in the universe, and because the cosmic sources have never been in causal contact with
one another, it seems improbable (in line with Bell’s reasoning about the PRNG) that this light
could in any way be correlated with the hidden variables of a particle source in an experiment
being conducted today. However, by analogy with the black-hole event horizon, it is shown that
the cosmological invariant set is an atemporal one. The fact that the light was emitted billions


of years before the experiment took place is really a ‘red herring’. It is therefore predicted that if
these proposed experiments are conducted, Bell’s inequalities will continue to be violated. This experiment draws to attention the notion that if quantum theory can be replaced by a
deeper causal deterministic theory, that theory must treat cosmology and quantum physics much
more synergistically than is done in contemporary theories of physics.
