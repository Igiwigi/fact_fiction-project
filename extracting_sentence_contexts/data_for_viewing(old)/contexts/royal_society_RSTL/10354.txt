thicken up and are thus bronght into view. Â© Subsequently they cease to thicken, and
by the time the shrunken protoplasm has regained its equilibrium they become quite
lax. Both Bower and myself have observed that, after s8ome length of time has
elapsed, the threads execute lateral vibrations which are possibly caused by currents
due either to diffusion or to temperature.

It seems probable that the action of the salt-solution, unless very dilute, causes
grave changes to take place in the protoplagm. Ordinary cells do not give much
evidence of this, since on washing out with water they regain their usual appearance.

takes up in its stead the salt-solution.


PROTOPLASM THROUGH THE WALLS OF VEGETABLE CELLS. 855

_ If, however, Spirogyra cells be plasmolysed, it will be 8een that the whole structure
has been much atfected, for the chlorophyll bands will no more resume either their
accustomed appearance or arrangement, and a general swelling of the cell takes place.

The strings of protoplasm which normally traverse the cell vacuole in ordinary
living cells frequently exhibit the same appearances as those which are presented by
plasmolysed threads, and nodal swellings may also occur, I have observed this
