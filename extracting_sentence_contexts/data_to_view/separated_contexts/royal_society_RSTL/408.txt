Kxox on some phenomena of colours,

them to be always formed between the two lower contiguous
surfaces. Exp. 20. But it appearing very unaccountable that the
mere presence of the upper glass slip should produce spectra
between the two lower slips; I wished to have the fact cor-
roborated by another experiment. For this purpose two
similar slips of glass were so closely applied together, as to
produce primary fringes between them; and in this position
they were cemented together with bees? wax, to prevent. Shifting : this double slip being substituted, instead of the
two upper unconnected slips in Experiment 12, produced
binaries as usual.
