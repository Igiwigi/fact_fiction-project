In fig. 4, in which the values of d/d* are given, these lines have been absorbed by
Group 1, and the resolution into two groups is clearer. We note also that the second
group is more compact ; this is obviously the most satisfactory diagram, and we may
therefore conclude that as far as values above 10 atmospheres are concerned, the rate
of displacement is not far removed from that of the cube of the wave-length. It may
appear remarkable that any order can be arrived at considering the apparently chaotic
distribution of dots in Diagram 4 in the region of wave-lengths \ 4200 to \ 4500, and
it is necessary to emphasize the fact that the method consists in the elimination of the
dots with displacements varying from 5 to 8 thousandths of an Angstrém Unit from

the cloud of dots above them, and that we draw the above conclusion from
the fact that the group of dots representing high values of the displacement in
