crystals with two axes, for it is impossible to fix the situation
of the axes by which the phenomena are produced. In almost
every case, however, the most probable position of the axes is

coincident with some prominent line, either in the primitive or
secondary forms.*

The 'same coincidence ought therefore to be expected in the
case of the! cubical, octohedral, and rhomboido-dodecahedral
crystals;5-and it is a singular fact, that the cube, the octo-
hedron, and the -rhomboidal dodecahedron, are the only regular
geometvical solids in crystallography, in which neither more
nor less than three equal rectangular axes can be placed sym-
metrically. In the cube, for example, each of three axes is
perpendicular to the three pair of square surfaces by which
the solid is contained. In the regular octohedron each of them
coincides-with, the line which joins the six solid angles of the
figure; and. in the. rhomboidal dodecahedron, each of the rec-
tangular/ axes /passes through the six solid angles, each of
which is contained by four-acute angles of the rhomboidal
planes,
