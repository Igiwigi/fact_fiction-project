analytical and geometrica! Methods of Investigation. 1921

lines and mixtilinear triangles therein exhibited cannot be called
natural signs, since they are only imperfect and inadequate
representations of other imaginary lines and triangles, of which
the mind must form what notion it can. Not, however, to infer
want of perspicuity from inefficiency in the cause assigned, if
we employ the geometrical method, or view its employment in
investigation, concerning motion, curves, &c. it will not appear
a perspicuous method ; and, if instances of its obscurity were re-
quired of me, I could find them, even in the immortal work of
the Principia. Whether we consider the fact, or speculate about
the cause, I think the geometrical method can only be allowed
to have superior evidence in investigations of a simple nature.

That the analytical calculus is more commodious for the de-
duction of truth than the geometrical, will not perhaps be con-
tested; and, an examination into its nature, would shew why it
is 80 well adapted for easy combination and extensive gene-
ralization, No language like: the language of analysis, one of
the greatest of modern mathematicians has observed, is capable
of such elegance as flows from the developement of a long
series of expressions connected one with the other, and all de-
pendent on the same fundamental idea.
