5 Whharzven opinion may be entertained of the theory of light
SE and colours which I have lately had the honour of submitting
© to the Royal Society, it must at any rate be allowed that it has
5 given birth to the discovery of a simple and general law, capable
= of explaining a number of the phenomena of coloured light,
Z which, without this law, would remain insulated and unintelli-
3 gible. The law is, that & wherever two portions of the same
5 « light arrive at the eye by different routes, either exactly or
S « yery nearly in the same direction, the light becomes most
> <« jntense when the difference of the routes is any multiple of a
Z « certain length, and least intense in the intermediate state of
i= « the interfering portions ; and this length is different for light
E « of different colours.”

= I have already shown in detail, the sufficiency of this law for
Z explaining all the phenomena described in the second and third
= books of NEwTon's Optics, as well as some others not men-
Z tioned by NEwToN. But it is still more satisfactory to observe
its conformity to other facts, which constitute new and distinct
classes of phenomena, and which could scarcely have agreed 50
well with any anterior law, if that law had been erroneous or
imaginary : these are, the colours of fibres, and the colours of
mixed plates.


388 Dr. Youxs's Account of some Cases

As I was observing the appearance of the fine parallel lines
of light which are seen upon the margin of an object held
near the eye, 50 as to intercept the greater part of the light of a
distant luminous object, and which are produced by the fringes
caused by the inflection of light already known, I observed that
they were sometimes accompanied by coloured fringes, much
broader and more distinct; and I soon found, that these broader '
fringes were occasioned by the accidental interposition of a hair. In order to make them more distinct, I employed a horse-hair;
but they were then no longer visible.
