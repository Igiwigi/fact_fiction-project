The aspect ratio of a fusion reactor should be between 2.5 and 3, where 3 might be slightly
too high already. An aspect ratio below 2.5 is most likely unrealistic because when considering
the blanket, shielding and VV, the space for the central solenoid (CS) would not be sufficient
for achieving enough inductive current drive for a long pulse machine; see also below where
current drive is discussed. Low aspect ratio is very important for edge stability and high pedestal
pressures because the same triangularity and elongation have a stronger effect at low aspect ratio.
In addition, low aspect ratio permits a larger elongation and triangularity. In the past 20 years
and also during the ITER EDA, it was argued that the bootstrap current fraction is higher at
higher aspect ratio; therefore, many reactor designs are at aspect ratio 3.5 or even 4. The problem
is that at such high aspect ratio the energy confinement at high density would certainly be in
the stiff regime and one would not achieve the full H-mode confinement and certainly not an
improved electron confinement regime. This is due to the fact that even if one could achieve the
