Figure 1. Translating LOFAR’s angular and spectral resolution into k , and k,. (a) The shaded regions represent the values of k ,
which can be reached by the Dutch core (purple), Dutch remote (blue) and international (green) stations. The gap in between
them arises from the fact that there is a large geographical distance between the outermost Dutch stations and the closest
international stations. The grey shaded region on the left shows the horizon limit. (6) The grey lines show the limits on k;, based
on the total bandwidth (48 MHz) and the smallest frequency resolution possible in a standard observing mode (0.76 kHz). The
frequency spacing will be channelized, and the colour scale runs from wider channels (blue), which means more infrequent
coverage in kj space, to narrower channels (orange), which means more frequent coverage in ky, space.
