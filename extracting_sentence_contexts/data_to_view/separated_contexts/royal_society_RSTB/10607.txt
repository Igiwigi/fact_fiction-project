This precise timing of
male conspicuousness in relation to female fertility indicates
that the delayed male spring moult as well as the timing of
dirtying is under strong sexual selection. Taken together, many lines of evidence suggest that
sexual selection may shape the timing of avian seasonal pro-
cesses like reproductive behaviour, migration and moult that
are based on biological clocks. Complexity in understanding
both selection pressures on and molecular mechanisms of
annual timing is added by the fact that subsequent seasonal
events can depend on each other and possibly constrain the
action of sexual selection on individual seasonal components. For example, a change in the timing of one seasonal event like
migration can have significant carry-over effects on sub-
sequent events including reproduction and moult [133]. Such carry-over effects could result from trade-offs (individ-
uals investing into reproduction may not be able to invest
into moult at the same time) and/or from changes to aspects
of the biological clock.
