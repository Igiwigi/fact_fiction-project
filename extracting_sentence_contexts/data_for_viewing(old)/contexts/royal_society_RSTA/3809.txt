the desired streamwise and spanwise size and to enforce periodic boundary conditions on the
boundaries. In this way, for instance, it has been possible to show that streaky motions in the
buffer layer are self-sustaining [43]. Excluding smaller-scale motions without seriously damaging
the solution at the considered scale has proven to be a challenging issue. Our preliminary tests, in
which under-resolved Navier-Stokes simulations were used in order to exclude motions smaller
than the grid spacing, were inconclusive because the considered large-scale structures were too
poorly resolved and unphysical energy production peaks appeared corresponding to the grid
size. This could have been expected because residual motions, unresolved by the grid, must
be modelled, as is well known by practitioners of large-eddy simulations (LESs). The idea has
therefore been to use LESs and to model small-scale motions with a purely dissipative model
which inhibits energy production by the (unresolved) small scales [44,45]. The equations used in

2The term ‘coherent’ lift-up here is used to emphasize the fact that the optimal energy amplification is computed on averaged
streaks by explicitly accounting, for the Reynolds stresses associated with turbulent fluctuations and to differentiate these
results from standard lift-up computations, where Reynolds stresses are not taken into account and which give different
results.
