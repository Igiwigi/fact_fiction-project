And every one who is even slightly acquainted with the history of that Science
*Must be well aware that the standard Monographs which have been devoted to this
Sject have exerted a more permanent influence on its progress, than have any of those
Somprehensive Systems which have been set up from time to time, and, after lasting for
*8-while, have been overthrown to make way for others scarcely more durable. For any
ystem of Claxsification is liable to be invalidated by new discovery ; and the utmost
-Shich can be claimed for it is, that it accurately represents the state of knowledge at
She time of its promulgation. But every Monograph which contains a faithful descrip-
"Yon of the structure and life-history of any type whatever, however far it may be from
Sbsolute completeness, presents a body of facts which subsequent research may add to
{8 cannot set aside; and may come to acquire, even at a long swbsequent period, a
ne not anticipated by its author. I cannot, suppose, therefore, that any apology is needed for my offering to the Royal
> Society a detailed account of perhaps the most interesting of our British Echinoderms ;
of which the structure, notwithstanding the attention given to it by various eminent
 Anatomists, has been hitherto but very imperfectly made out ; whilst of its life-history
*$till less is known. That I have solved every problem which its study has presented, is
» far more than I can affirm ; but I venture to think that what T now bring forward will
* 8tand the test of future scrutiny ; and that the results T have attained will prove of im-
Portance, not merely in leading to a better understanding of the important group of
* which Antedon is a representative, but also in helping to the solution of certain funda-
> mental questions in General Physiology.
