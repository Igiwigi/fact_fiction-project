RosENMULLER states that in all the caverns he has
examined, the bones are disposed nearly after the same man-
ner; sometimes scattered Separately, and sometimes accumu-
lated in beds and heaps of many feet in thickness ; they are
found every where from the entrance to the deepest and most
Secret recesses ; never in entire skeletons, but single bones

tact with, or near to the upper ones, as would follow from
the fact last mentioned.* They are often buried in a brown
argillaceous or marly earth, as'in the cases of Gailenreuth,
Zahnloch, and in the Hartz, which earth, from an analysis
by M. FRISCHMAN, Seems to contain a large 'proportion of
animal matter derived from the decay of the fleshy parts of
the bears. In the caves of Gailenreuth and Mockas, a large proportion
of the bones is invested with stalactite, Even entire beds, and
heaps of them many feet thick, are 5ometimes cemented 'to-
gether by it, s0 as to form a compact breecia. \Occasionally
they adhere by stalactite to the sides of the cavern, but are ne-
ver found in the substance of the rock itself.
