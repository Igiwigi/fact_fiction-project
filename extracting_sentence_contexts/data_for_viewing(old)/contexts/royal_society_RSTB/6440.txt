provided by the male. The common fowl and the pheasant are examples of the
first kind ; the pigeon is an example of the second. Concerning the pigeon, HARPER,
in a paper published in 1904, writes as follows : “* When a pair ready for mating is
put together, egg-laying ordinarily ensues at the end of a rather definite period, at
the least eight days. Thé female functions are held in abeyance till the proper
stimulus is received from the mate. The maturing of the egg is so exclusively a
female function that it seems odd at first thought that an apparent exception should
occur to the rule. Of course, we know that the final maturation of the egg, or the
giving off of the polar bodies, awaits in most animals the act of fertilization. But
here the effect is produced upon the egg by the entrance of sperms. How mating
and the act of copulation (which is repeated at frequent intervals every day at this
time) could influence the ripening of the egg in the ovary is another problem. In
this connexion the curious fact must be mentioned that two female pigeons placed in
confinement may both take to laying eggs. The function of ovulation is in a state of
tension, so to speak, that requires only a slight stimulus, ‘ mental,’ apparently in

* By removing the complete clutch, CHance obtained “ repeat layings ” in the blackcap, carrion
crow, raven, dunlin, and golden plover. Further, the house sparrow, garden warbler, kestrel, and
merlin could be induced to lay three complete clutches, and the red-backed shrike four clutches, but
there was some reduction in the normal number of eggs in the fourth clutch.
