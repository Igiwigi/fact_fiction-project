If we now consider that the half of 18'2 is 9'1, we might almost be led to expect a
subdivision of the spot «, with its train*, into others, one of which should have its
maximum at the fiducial point Y, and another half-way between that point and «.
And though I am not disposed to attribute much weight to the fact, it is right to
mention that when paper prepared with Indian ink was used, and a very pale yellow
glass interposed between the lens and the spectrum, an oval spot, having its centre
precisely on the point Y, was actually insulated.. And this experiment, it should also

measures, and in the absence of any speculative views concerning them.

140. The gaseous media through which the rays have reached their point of action,
are the atmospheres of the sun and earth. The effect of the former is beyond our
control, unless we could carry our experiments to such a point of delicacy as to
operate separately on rays emanating from the centre and borders of the sun's disc.
That of the earth's, though it cannot be eliminated any more than in the case of the
sun's, may yet be varied to a considerable extent by experiments made at great ele-
