mable air, from accidental circumstances, that it would be im-
possible at all times to ascertain, by a chemical process, at all
parts of the mine, when danger is impending, for frequently
the greatest differences of proportions exist at the same time,
in different parts of such extensive works as coal mines. In
fact, the miners know, from the appearance of the light of
their candles, when the proportion of hydrogen gas is such,
as to threaten an explosion ; hence they carefully watch each
other's candles, that they may desist in time, and escape instant
destruction.

The excavations of coal mines are much greater than they
are generally supposed to be: in some collieries they are con-
tinued for many miles, forming numerous windings and turn-
ings, along which the pit-men have frequently to walk for
forty or fifty minutes before they arrive at the workings, during
which time, as well as when at work, they have no direct
communication with the surface of the earth, but are entirely
