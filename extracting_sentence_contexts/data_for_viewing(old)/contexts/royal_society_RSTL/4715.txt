larva, ova are produced by it, and from these the larva again is developed; the
whole process differing from that common to animals in general, in nothing but the
independence and apparent individuality of the generative organ.

different from metaphysical individuality, and that the whole question of the pro-
priety of the © alternation theory ” as a means of colligating the facts (for at best it
can be nothing more) turns upon the nature and amount of this difference.

If the true definition of the zoological individual be (as the writer believes it to be)

In accordance with this definition, neither the form A, nor the form B would be a
©zoological individual; not either of their forms, but both together, answer to the
