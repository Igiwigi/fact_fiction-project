Most particles would have sufficiently large salt mass to ensure
their activation and subsequent growth within the clouds, without being so large as to encourage
precipitation. Moreover, they would be sufficiently numerous so as to enhance the cloud droplet
number concentration to values substantially higher than the natural level, thereby enhancing the
cloud albedo [3,4]. Major advantages of using MCB as compared to other geoengineering proposals, such as
injecting sulfur into the stratosphere (which can deplete stratospheric ozone), include the ability
to localize application, the relatively rapid reduction of most effects on cessation of spraying,
and the fact that seawater is non-polluting and non-toxic. As with all proposed geoengineering
methods, the possibility of unintended consequences cannot be excluded. We have been studying various techniques for salt spray production for some time and our
earlier results have been reported [5-7].
