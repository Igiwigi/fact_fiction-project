If the molecules
act on one another only at a determinate distance by a kind of impact, the viscosity will
be as the square root of the absolute temperature. This, however, is certainly not the
actual law. If, as the experiments of Granaw and those of this paper show, the visco-
sity is as the first power of the absolute temperature, then in the dynamical theory,
which is framed to explain the facts, we must as8ume that the force between two mole-
cules is proportional inversely to the fifth power of the distance between them. The
present, paper, however, does not profess to give any explanation of the cause of the
viscosity of air, but only to determine its value in different cases. Experiments were made on a few other gases besides dry air.
