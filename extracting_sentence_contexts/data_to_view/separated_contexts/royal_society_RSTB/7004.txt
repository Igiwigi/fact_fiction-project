The movement of parts of the body of a
barnacle, I consider, show a similar, but much greater differentiation of this power of
hydrostatic control. 6. MECHANISM OF EXTRUSION OF BODY Theventral longitudinal muscles of the trunk region occupy a typical position on either side
ofthe nerve chain, forming, in fact, the walls ofan epineural blood sinus (figures 4 and 5). They
consist, on either side, of an inner series and a separate lateral constituent which I deal with
later. The inner series is attached to the tendinous sheets which extend inwards from the deep
intersegmental folds along the ventral body wall.
