Instead, a plausible
hypothesis is that when the novice partner queries the expert
for advice, then the expert’s confidence in their own knowl-
edge increases. This is consistent with recent empirical
results showing that the act of giving advice to others increases
one’s confidence [36]. In fact, in one study, giving advice raised
self-reported confidence more than receiving advice did [37]. This latter result is consistent with our finding that experts
giving advice increased their self-reported understanding
more than did novices receiving advice from experts. The
increase in experts’ self-reported understanding when they
are put in dyads was not, alas, preceded by actual improve-
ments in their accuracy.
