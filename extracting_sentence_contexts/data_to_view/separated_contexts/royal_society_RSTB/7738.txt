Here, significant progress could be made paper, we briefly mentioned two further questions
through quantitative genetic studies, which have central to this problem (see ยง1; Ball & Balthazart

trait variance in wild bird populations (Merila & the level of plasma T and the development or
Sheldon 2001). Another fruitful approach might be to maintenance of a trait? (ii) What is the biological
