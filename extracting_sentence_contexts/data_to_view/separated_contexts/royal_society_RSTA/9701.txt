Above, the isothermal convection ceases and absorption and
radiation are equal. The paper should be consulted. The numerical values are of
course somewhat doubtful, especially since the amount of aqueous vapour at different
heights is uncertain, but the whole theory seems eminently reasonable, and apart from
details explains the general fact of the isothermal region. If this theory be correct,
then air that is below the mean temperature for its own height and for the season

will be air that has recently risen and conversely, for the air changes its temperature
slowly under the influence of radiation, but instantly under the influence of change
of pressure. Also, the magnitude of the temperature departure from the mean
should be an index of the intensity of the ascending or descending motion.
