In particular,
we note that the accelerated proton beams exhibit higher energies than classical hole boring,
compatible with CSA. However, the Ht energy in our simulations does not appear to scale as
the CSA model. This is probably due to the fact that ions have not yet outrun the shock field, as
previously discussed. The variation of the shock speed during the acceleration process, as shown
in figure 4, may also play a role. Besides the average energy, also the Ht cutoff energy and the


number of ions reflected by the shock increase with the laser intensity.
