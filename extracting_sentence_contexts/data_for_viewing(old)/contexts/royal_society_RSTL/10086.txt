Hence its depth is greatest at A. and B, increasing upwards and outwards towards the
extra-limbic portion, and thus forming a specially rich formation in Ferres's region (7).*
When these measurements are contrased with those of the same stratum in the Pig,?
a great similariby is at once perceived. As before shown, the depth varies with the two
kinds of arrangement observed by these cells, viz. : the clustered or the solitary. Thus
in the Pig the clustered cells attained an average depth of 595 mm., whilst the dense
confluent series in the Rabbit average +506 mm. The depth, however, affords but an
imperfect guide to the relative richness of the stratum in cells—a better notion is
gained by the fact that the quarter-inch field will reveal in the confluent series as many
as 90 to 100 cells, whilst the laminar series will give to the same power not over
6 or 8 cells.

2. Form of cell. —The cell of this series is usually an elongate pyramid, although
the oval and large fusiform cell is occasionally met with, as is also a bifurcate or horned
cell; the latter, however, far less common than in the Sheep and Pig. It was stated
as regards the form of these cells in the Pig, a striking uniformity in their contour was
observable, *by far the greater proportion taking the form of an elongate pyramid, the
few exceptions occurring being usually gigantic spindles.” F In this respect the
ganglionic cells in the Rabbit's brain agree with those of the Pig and Sheep in
not exhibiting the great irregularity in marginal conformation, which is a peculiar
character of the same series of cells in Man. The group of ganglionic cells from the
