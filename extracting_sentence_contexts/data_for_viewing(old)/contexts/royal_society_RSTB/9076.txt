[48], have recently proposed a method called the corr-max trans-
formation that achieves these objectives [49]. They show that W
can be calculated from:

W = (SSS) '/?S(X —x), (2.5)

where S is a diagonal matrix of the inverses of the standard devi-
ations of the x variables, >; is the correlation matrix , X¥ is a
mathematical vector of the mean values of the x variables and
X is a vector of values of the sample point giving the observed
value of the MD to the centroid defined by x. The individual
elements of W show a close correspondence (high correlation)
with the individual x variables (in fact, the correlation between
x; and w; is the (i,j) element of (SS,S)"?, and the transformation
maximizes the sum of the x;—w; correlations).

When there is a strong correlation (greater than 0.9) between
some of the original x variables, the right-hand side of equation
(2.5) should be pre-multiplied by an orthogonal matrix that
rotates the correlated variables (and only them). This effectively
replaces, for example, two correlated variables with two new
variables, their sum and their difference, which will be less cor-
related. Interpretation of the resulting values in W remains the
same except that the respective components now refer to the
importance of the sum and difference of the correlated variables
