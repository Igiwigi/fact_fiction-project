Gay Lussac, namely, the action of
sulphuric acid on the oxyiode of barium, nor by other methods
of my own institution ; and. that in experiments on the effects
of the acids on the oxyiodes, new combinations only were
formed, I have lately resumed this enquiry, and by pursuing
a new and entirely different plan of operation, I have at last
succeeded in combining oxygene and iodine. In the follow-
ing pages I shall describe the circumstances which led me to
ascertain the existence of this compound, and I shall detail
some experiments on its analysis and its chemical agencies. In the course of my researches, I observed, that when a
solution of the compound of iodine and chlorine was poured
into alkaline solutions, or even into certain muriatic solutions,
the precipitate was an oxyiode; and this fact seemed to indi-
cate, that iodine had a stronger attraction for oxygene than

chlorine; iodine, likewise, has an attraction for chlorine; it
appeared, therefore, extremely probable, that euchlorine, or
the gaseous combination of oxygene and chlorine, would be
decomposed by heat, and two compounds formed, one of
oxygene and iodine, and the other of iodine and chlorine,
or that a triple compound would be produced from which
chlorine could be easily Separated, and on submitting the
idea to the test of experiment, I found that I had not been
deceived. To produce the compound of oxygene and jodine, it is
necessary merely to bring the euchlorine and iodine together
at the ordinary temperature of the atmosphere. 'As s0on as

- the euchlorine comes in” contact with the iodine, there is an
immediate action, its colour changes to bright orange, and
a liquid is formed,  When' the euchlorine is in sufficient
quantity, a white substance likewise appears.” By the appli-
cation of a gentle heat, the orange compound of chlorine and
iodine may be made to rise in vapour ; and the compound of
oxygene and iodine remains. When this compound is required to be'dry, the euchlorine
Should be passed through dry muriate of lime ( calcane)be-
fore it is admitted to the jodine.
