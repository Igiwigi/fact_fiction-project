and to the cusps of the teeth, differs from that of the other nodules which are always
present in certain constant positions. Also they occur only in isolated specimens, and
then usually only on one side of the jaw. Whatever significance they may have, if
indeed there is any phylogenetic significance to be attached to them, it is certain that

they are of a totally different nature from that of the epithelial bodies which lie inside
the enamel organs in close relation to the cusps.

Another very significant fact is that, in the latest stage examined (H.X.), typical
small epithelial nodules are found developing in relation to the apices of the anterior
and posterior cusps of the medial cingulum of the lower tooth “‘y”’ (fig. 95, Plate 48).
These lie just over the cusps and are connected to them by a strand of cells in exactly
the same way as the epithelial bodies appear in their early stages over the main cusps
of the teeth. Since these bodies are similar in all respects (except their degree of
maturity) to the series in group A, and since they lie on the medial side of the enamel
organ, it makes it impossible to believe, even apart from other evidence, that any of the

+ nodules belonging to group A can represent vestigial milk teeth.
