106 MR. W B. HARDY ON SOME FEATURES AND PROPERTIES OF

Internal Connections of the Posterior Dorsal Nerves.

These, as will be remembered, arise from the dorsal and external surface of the
inter-ganglionic cord, a variable but short distance posterior to the ganglion. As was
pointed out before, they each consist of two parts derived respectively from the {
ganglion above and the ganglion below. This fact is only demonstrable by sections,
since simple dissection merely reveals the fact that they arise a very short distance
posterior to, but in very close connection with the second abdominal ganglion. I
have examined these nerves in detail in the first five abdominal ganglia. Each nerve
is composed of from ten to thirteen tubular fibres, which vary in size from 12 to 13 p.

On entering the nerve-cord, or a little distance before entering it, each nerve
divides into two unequally sized roots, of which the smaller, containing generally i
three fibres, passes down the inter-ganglionic commissure to the ganglion next below.
It at first lies on the external dorsal angle of the cord, but soon makes its way =
obliquely over the external giant fibre* to a more median position, and then curves
ventrally to ran in the external region of the dorsal group of longitudinal fibres.
These I propose to call the descending root. The remaining fibres, eight to ten in
