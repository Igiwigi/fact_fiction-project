These changes pose risks to public health including the
emergence of vector-borne diseases [1,70,77].

(b) Climate change impact on West Nile virus

transmission

WNYV was first reported in North America in New York City
in 1999, when it infected many species of birds as well as
humans and other mammals [36]. Later, the virus moved
across the continent, reaching Canada and Central America
by 2002 and was isolated in California in July 2003 [80]. In
fact, WNV became endemic across most temperate regions
of North America [12]. The effects of weather fluctuations on WNV transmission
in the USA and Canada have been analysed by several
researchers who showed that increased temperatures influ-
ence North American WNV distribution and play an
important role in the maintenance and amplification of
human infection [43,81]. Soverow et al. [42] assessed 16 298
human WNF cases from 2001 to 2005 across 17 states in the
USA.
