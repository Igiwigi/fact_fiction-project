It thus appears that the decomposition takes place in two stages, the former of which
is complete immediately after the destruction of the blue compound, and in which the
two substances lose equal amounts of oxygen; while the latter requires seyeral hours
for its completion, the solution during this time being in a continual state of change.


DISOXTDATION EFFECTED BY THE ALKALINE PEROXIDES. 851

It is undoubtedly difficult to speak with any great probability as to the nature of the
specific changes which take place, in regard to which many hypotheses may be formed.

The following view, however, is in accordance with the facts.

1. When z=1, we have the formation and subsequent decomposition of the substance
Cr, Og, according to the equations

2Cr, O0,+3H, O,=Cr, O, +3 H, O,
Cr, O, =Cr, O,+30,.

2. When #=2, after the reaction just expressed the substance Cr, Og is further oxi-

dized to the oxide Cr, O,,, according to the equation
Cr, O,+3H, O,=Cr, O,,+3H, O.
