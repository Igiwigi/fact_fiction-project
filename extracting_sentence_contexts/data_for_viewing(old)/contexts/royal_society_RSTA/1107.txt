know as the amplitude adjusted FT or AAFT surrogates. The amplitude adjustment, however,
can distort the autocorrelation function. Further improvement can be achieved by an iterative
amplitude adjustment/FT randomization procedure. Achieving convergence, the iterative AAFT—
IAFT surrogates fit well both the distribution and the autocorrelation function of the original time
series [34].

Permutation surrogates are suitable for randomizing phase time series, especially when the :
marked event phases constructed according to equation (3.7) are used. Having the times of aa
the events ..., tx1, tk, tk41,..., we extract the sequence of periods ... , pk—1, Pk, Pk+1,---, Le. cycle
durations as px = ty — th_1. The periods are then randomly reordered and a new phase time series
is constructed based on the reordered sequence. The process is repeated until the desired number
of surrogate time series is obtained. Note the difference from the IID surrogates when the elements
of time series are randomly reordered generating a white noise sample, while here we in fact
reorder the whole cycles.

For ‘continuous’ Hilbert phase, obtained according to equation (3.5), essentially the same
procedure applies but care must be taken to preserve the intra-period information in the
signal. The signal is first divided into periods and all the periods except the first and last
are permuted randomly. The first and last period are not displaced because this would create
discontinuities in the surrogate signal as usually only a part of the first and last period is available.

The distribution of phases and the intra-cycle dynamics are preserved when this method is
applied.

Note that permuting the whole cycles we preserve the intra-cycle dynamics, however, we
