We selected the reduced ten Tusscher et al. (TT3) ionic model for the human ventricular AP,
which has been used in related studies both in reduced [49] and original [28] form. It is well
established that predictions can change significantly between models, and in a context-dependent
manner [55-57]. We have not explored to what extent our conclusions are model-independent.
Additionally, some experimental and computational studies have suggested that acidosis may
play an important role in intracellular calcium handling, potentially generating pro-arrhythmic
delayed afterdepolarization events [58,59]. The simplifications adopted by the TT3 model prevent

it from capturing these dynamics, and our results may underestimate the impact of acidosis : =

In fact, the effects of ischaemia sit across multiple types of physics and multiple spatial scales 1B

speak only to the electrical remodelling that occurs in direct response to ischaemia.
