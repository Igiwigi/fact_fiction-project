Another cause will doubtless be the altered
vibrations of two molecules when very near to one another. This will perhaps become
important at high pressures, but we will not further consider it at present.

§ 39. Lastly, we have to take into account the fact that the train of single waves
emitted by each vibrating molecule is not infinite in length, but has a definite
beginning and ending. ‘The effect of this cause is investigated below. The Doppler
effect is included in the same piece of analysis. We shall arrive at the remarkable
result that the limiting width of the spectrum line when the pressure is indefinitely
diminished is less by some 10 per cent. than the width calculated by Lord Ray.eicu,
who took into account nothing but the Doppler effect.
