the ions that were selected for quantitation. In the QTOF experiment, opioids were quantified aed
using the precursor ions while the QQQ measurements required product ions, which are less 22
abundant [15]. Because a more recent QTOF was compared with a QQQ from a previous : S
generation, the higher sensitivity of the QTOF could be related to the improvements made to DNS
this new instrument. : S

Given the high cost of a mass spectrometer, many research laboratories lack the financial : &

resources to purchase various state-of-the-art devices. Moreover, the cumbersomeness of using
different instruments to analyse one sample is preferably avoided. The recent development of
hybrid devices combining the benefits of multiple instruments, therefore, allows researchers to
use the same tool for various purposes [17,18]. Two interesting examples are the QTrap and
the QTOF, which are in fact triple quadrupoles wherein the last quadrupole is replaced by a
linear ion trap or a TOF tube, respectively. As a result, the high speed and sensitivity of a
conventional QQQ is combined with a higher resolution in the case of a QTOF or with MS"-
capability in case of a QTrap, respectively. When comparing these two instruments, it should be
noted that both devices are extremely suitable for both identification and quantification [17,19,20].
The QTOF can therefore be used in HRMS, but its slightly lower scan speed limits the duty
cycle when multiple analytes have to be quantified. Although orbitrap mass analysers have
a reduced acquisition speed, they are increasingly used in pharmaceutical industry owing to
their very high resolution. The resolving power up to 500000 full width at half maximum
(FWHM) with an isotopic fidelity up to 240000 FWHM at m/z 200 that can be obtained with
the newest generation is mainly used to elucidate proteomic and metabolomic pathways [21].
Recently, Lin et al. published a clear overview of the different types of hybrid HRMS and their
characteristics [10].
