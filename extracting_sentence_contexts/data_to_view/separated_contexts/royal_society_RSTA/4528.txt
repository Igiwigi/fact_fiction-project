[Added May 15.—This depends on
the field-strength. At low fields, within the range of tensions used in the present
experiments, the effect of tension in reducing magnetisation diminishes slightly as
the tension is increased, at stronger fields the opposite is th ecase ; in other words, at
low fields 6°I/AP* is positive, at high fields negative. This may partly explain the fact
observed by Brpwett that at low fields increase of tension diminishes the magnetic
contraction in nickel, at high fields increases it. For if part of the contraction is
represented by

al
—e=1}H Pa?
then
oe oI
ap = — 2H ap

which is negative at low, positive at high fields.]
