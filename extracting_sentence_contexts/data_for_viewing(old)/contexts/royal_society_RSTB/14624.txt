fundamental understanding of how ecological systems slowing down can be detected in the temporal or spatial
work (e.g. [30,56,58)). dynamics of ecosystems (increase in recovery time, temporal
variance, autocorrelation and skewness of a variable used to
quantify the ecosystemâ€™s state, such as total biomass) [64].
Therefore, using temporal or spatial data of a given eco-
system, we should be able to detect whether the system is
losing resilience.

The phenomenon of critical slowing down seems to
be universal and occurs when any dynamical system
approaches a transition. In fact, mathematically, the early-

Altogether, these studies suggest that incorporating the
diversity of interactions in ecological theory is a worthwhile
effort [57]. There is, however, currently no work that we
know of about alternative stable states and their implica-
tions for the responses of multi-layer ecological systems to
environmental changes.
