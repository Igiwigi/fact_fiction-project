The configuration is identical to that analysed in figure 3, except the ENZ host is characterized by
relative permittivity: (a) ¢) = 10.01 and (6) ¢) = i0.03.


5. Conclusion | |

We have theoretically and numerically demonstrated that ENZ media can be used to induce
strong magnetic field inhomogeneities in neighbouring dielectrics, and, in turn, generate strong :f
magnetic field concentrations. In fact, the magnetic field magnitude enhancement factor is in is
theory unbounded, and it is thus in principle possible to obtain arbitrarily large enhancement :
factors as the size of the ENZ body increases. Naturally, this process is limited in practice by
the presence of dissipation losses. However, numerical simulations reveal that the magnetic field
enhancement at the zeroth-order (1 =0) resonance of a circular dielectric rod can be increased by
one order of magnitude with moderate losses (£, = i0.01—i0.03).
