night, and vice versd the rest of the year.” But we shall 80on ee that this way of ex-
pressing the fact, by speaking of morning and evening tides, is quite inaccurate. It is easily seen that, the theory of the tides, which supposes them to be produced
by the ocean assuming its form of equilibrium under the influence of the moon's
attraction, would give a diurnal difference of the tides: for if the moon have 20®
north declination, the tide spheroid will have one pole in latitude 20* north, and the
other in 20* south latitude; and as the earth revolves, a place in 50 north latitude
will have the tide which belongs to these two poles alternately : and as it is 30” from
one pole and 70* from the other, the two tides will be very unequal. Now it has been found, with regard to all the other inequalities of the tides, that
they follow the /aws of the tides of the equilibrium-theory, although the consfant ele-
ments (the magnitudes and epochs) can be determined only by observation.
