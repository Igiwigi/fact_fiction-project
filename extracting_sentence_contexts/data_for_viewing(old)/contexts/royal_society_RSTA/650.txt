problems which led to the discovery of the quantum of action [/], it was also not to begin 3
with realized, that the insufficiency of the laws of classical mechanics and electrodynamics 1B
in dealing with atomic problems, disclosed by this discovery, implies a shortcoming of the :
causality ideal itself. [45, pp. 94-95] D8

In present terms, these classical cases are handled by non-visualizable realist models (again,
underlain by visualizable models of classical mechanics applied to the elemental constituents 2
of such systems), in contrast to non-realist models of quantum mechanics, such as that of Bohr, : So
indeed introduced in its ultimate non-realist version in the same article, and others in the spirit :
of Copenhagen. As Bohr notes elsewhere: ‘[I]t is most important to realize that the recourse
to probability laws under such circumstances is essentially different in aim from the familiar
application of statistical considerations as practical means of accounting for the properties of
mechanical systems of great structural complexity. In fact, in quantum physics, we are presented
not with intricacies of this kind, but with the inability of the classical frame of concepts to
comprise the peculiar feature of indivisibility, or ‘individuality’, characterizing the elementary
processes’ [12, vol. 2, p. 34].

In each case, the wave function provides, in Schrédinger’s way of putting it, ‘expectation
catalogues’ concerning quantum experiments [26, p.158]. Any such catalogue is reset with
each new measurement, which renders previous history of measurement on the same object
irrelevant as concerns our predictions from this point on [36, pp. 73-76]. The meaning of these
catalogues is subject to a further interpretation, even if one follows the spirit of Copenhagen.
Such interpretations may, for example, be either probabilistic, Bayesian or statistical, in the sense
that I shall now explain. According to Pauli:
