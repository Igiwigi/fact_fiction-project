GOLD ALLOYED WITH IRON. '

The effects of iron upon gold seem to have been less.under-
Stood, and more erroneously stated, than even those of tin, For


78 Mr. HatcurrT's Experiments on the various Alloys,

it has been $0 repeatedly asserted by various chemists, and 0
universally believed by all persons concerned in the melting
and working of gold, that the ductility of it is destroyed, or
much injured, by very small portions of iron, that, had it not
been for the determination made, when these experiments were
begun, to exa:aine, by experiments made expressly for the pur-
pose, every assertion respecting the effect of alloys, this long
established opinion would not here have been questioned. Indeed, considering how easy it was to ascertain whether
or not gold could be rendered brittle by the addition of iron,
it is a matter of astonishment, when we read in the works of
many celebrated chemists, and when we hear intelligent and
judicious artists assert, that iron, even in minute proportions,
injures or destroys the ductility of gold.*

It is not necessary here to inquire how this erroneous idea
first originated ; but, that the fact is absolutely the reverse, the
following experiments will sufficiently prove. Experiment 1. To eleven ounces one pennyweight and three grains of gold,
23 car. g7 fine, eighteen pennyweights and twenty-one grains
of clean iron wire were added.
