assuming a single temperature source [89,99], have been proposed [100]. It was recently shown
that the ratio of the soft X-ray solar flare fluxes [99] constitutes a viable SEP event forecasting
parameter [100]. A technique to provide short-term forecasting of SEPs based on flare location,
flare size and evidence of particle acceleration/escape as parametrized by flare longitude, time-
integrated soft X-ray intensity and time-integrated intensity of type III radio emission at ~1 MHz,
respectively, was proposed by Laurenza et al. [101]. This concept was recently re-validated and
termed as: Empirical model for Solar Proton Events Real Time Alert (ESPERTA) [102], while it
was further extended to the prediction of greater than or equal to S2 radiation storms [103].

At this point, one should note that the aforementioned concepts are built on the dominant
idea of the 1970s and the 1980s that solar flares are the single drivers of SEP events (figure 3).
Thereby, the usage of CME characteristics (velocity and width) as input parameters in SEP event
short-term forecasting concepts is not yet completely exploitable. This is also due to the fact that
when the CME is—especially—well connected to the SEP-observer, particles could be arriving
at 1 AU, while the coronagraph observations required to estimate the CME parameters are still
being accumulated (as evidenced e.g. by the snowstorm effect in SOHO/LASCO images due
to particle impacts). However, since the peak particle intensity may only be reached several
hours later [105], a timely prediction of the peak intensity may still be possible if a reliable
CME speed can be determined from the available coronagraph images [106]. However, taking
