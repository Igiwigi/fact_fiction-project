+ The idea of polarity has been applied to the explanation of chemical phenomena by other chemists as well
as myself, I may refer especially to L5w1c's Introduction to his Organic Chemistry (vol. i. p. 1, Edition 1845).
Granan also has given, in the last edition of his Treatise on Chemistry, a chapter on Chemical Polarity, It
would be out of place to enter here on any criticizm of their views or comparison of them with my own, but I
give the reference for those who may be desirous to see the way in which others have treated this subject.

772 MR. BRODIE ON THE CONDITION OP CERTAIN ELEMENTS

1818, no new fact of the slightest importance has been added to its history. The
properties however of which I speak, can all be obseryed with the solution of the
peroxide of barium, in hydrochloric or acetic acid, which can be readily prepared.
The properties of this solution are different according as it is alkaline or acid. The
alkaline solution is of an unstable nature; even at ordinary temperatures it continu-
ally loses oxygen, and on heating undergoes rapid decomposition. The acid solution
is more permanent, may be long kept without sensible alteration, and may even be
heated to the boiling-point with no evident evolution of gas. Either s0lution, how-
ever, is violently decomposed when certain substances (among which finely divided
carbon or platinum are very effective) are thrown into it. In these cases the peroxide
is decomposed, while the carbon and platinum remain, as far as we know, unaltered.
"There are however other bodies which cause this decomposition with perhaps greater
energy, and themselves undergo a chemical change of the most surprising nature;
