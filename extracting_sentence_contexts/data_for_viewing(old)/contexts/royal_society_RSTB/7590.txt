part of North America (Clarke 1936; H. Chitty 1950).

The disappearance of one species probably has some effect upon the other. Peak popula-
tions of hares may greatly damage the vegetation; hares and grouse have certain parasites
in common (Green, Evans & Larsen 1943) and, as Lack (1951) has suggested, predators
no doubt take a significant toll of grouse when the hares disappear. Nevertheless, it seems
unlikely that there are enough hares to account for the grouse cycle in all areas where it
occurs, nor is the hare always the first of the two populations to disappear (Clarke 1936).
Moreover, there are certain population changes during a decline in ruffed grouse which are
probably not caused by the disappearance of hares. Clarke (1936) reports a typically
high proportion of old birds in declining populations, and King (1937) states, but without
giving his data, that these older birds furnish the breeding stock responsible for the next
recovery. In fact the decline in ruffed grouse, and also in bobwhite quail, Colinus virgin-
ianus (Errington 1945), is similar to that in the snowshoe hare in being spread out over
several years after a period of fairly stationary numbers. The view that the ruffed grouse -
cycle is due to an intraspecific process is, of course, implicit in Errington’s general con-
clusion (1946) that ‘intraspecific self-limiting mechanisms basically determine the popula-
tion levels...’. It is not impossible that these mechanisms may be essentially similar in
both hare and grouse.

One of the difficulties about accepting such views on population control is to see why
different species should have cycles of the same periodicity and be approximately in phase.
The intrinsic rates of increase may well be different in the hare and ruffed grouse, and peak
abundance is certainly not the same (Lack 1951). It would therefore be expected that their
