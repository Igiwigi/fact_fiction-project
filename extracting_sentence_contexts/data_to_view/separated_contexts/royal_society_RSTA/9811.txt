Thus the water carried up by the
ascending current will fall as positively charged heavy rain over one or other of the
edges of the ascending current. This is of course considering the case in its simplest
terms. As a matter of fact, the ascending current will vary in velocity, will have
its gusts and lulls just as a horizontal wind has. Such variations, however, will be
of great help in causing splashing, for Lenarp* found that “the sudden contact of
already deformed drops with a quicker air stream is very favourable to the breaking
of the drops.” Another consequence of the gusts and lulls in the ascending currents
will be the raising and lowering of the region in which the water is held in
suspension, and with this will follow rapid changes in the electrical field which may
possibly help to produce electrical discharges. The water which has become positively charged on the ascending current and then
fallen as rain will be the heavy rain which occurs in the centre of the thunderstorm :
the ‘ Platzvegen” of the German authors.
