It does not consist in the production of free ions
‘Sthroughout the volume of the air near it by the action of radiation like that from
‘Suranium and its compounds. & It might be supposed, however, that the nuclei consisted of ions, not produced
‘throughout the volume of the air, but having their origin at the surface of the zine. 2They might in fact be a direct product of the oxidation of the zinc, the oxygen or water
Zmolecules being split up, half of the molecule combining with the zinc, the other
part escaping into the surrounding gas as a free ion, One would expect the ions,
Eaccording to this view, to be all charged with electricity of the same sign. There
“sought therefore to have been a difference in the number of cloud particles produced
according as the zinc was made positive or negative. In fact one would expect, as
"B was found to be the case when the zinc was exposed to ultra-violet light, an increase
Sin the number of nuclei when the electromotive force was in one direction, that
namely tending to move the ions from the zine, and a diminution when the field was
Areversed.
