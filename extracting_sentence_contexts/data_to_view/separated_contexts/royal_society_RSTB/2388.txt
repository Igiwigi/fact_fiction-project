The sorus is mixed; the sporangia
have no definite orientation; the annulus is definitely interrupted at
the stalk, though it may show some slight signs of being oblique. The
number of spores is 48 to 64. In fact, there is in these species no
feature calling for special remark, as distinct from allied genera. This
result is not in accord with the observations of Merrrentus,t who
described and figured for Lomaria Patersoni a sporangium with an
oblique annulus, and a thick stalk. I have not found this in the
specimens from the Edinburgh Garden; the annulus is definitely
interrupted at the stalk, though it may be slightly oblique.
