range of phenotypes that broadly fall in three groups: in the their compound mutant phenotype is consistent with the
first, homozygotes get born, and display either craniofacial notion that Nodal absolutely requires them to signal. By
defects that lead them to an early death, or milder defects contrast, the fact that Smad2,3 double mutant embryos [56], as
or an absence of defects that let them reach adulthood (Acti- well as Smad4~/— embryos [57], are even smaller than
vin A, Activin B, Alk7, Smad3); in the second, homozygotes Nodal~'~ embryos suggests that zygotic Nodal may not be the
have primitive streak and/or left-right axis defects, which only ligand capable of activating the Smad2/3 pathway early
are sometimes mild enough to allow them to develop to on. Consistent with this view, the expression of a reporter

normally (Nodal, Gdf3, Alk4, Cripto, Smad2, Smad4). The up to embryonic day (E)4.5 in Nodal~/~ embryos [23].
