D. IMMS ON THE STRUCTURE AND BIOLOGY OF ARCHOTERMOPSIS.

workers as such were evolved, but this does not directly concern the subject under

discussion. In fact, the occurrence of dimorphism among the sterile castes is confined :
to the more specialised genera, and this in itself suggests that it may be a phylo-

genetically recent acquisition. In all cases the L and / factors would have no visible effect upon the AS individuals
(winged sexual forms), for among them dimorphism is unknown, Now, by crossing
two winged sexual forms, each of the gametic constitution A@Li/Ss, we have an
instance where three differentiating factors are combined, and the series contained in
their progeny comprises 27 different forms among 64 different individuals, as
elucidated by Mrnprn (vide Barrson, 1913, p. 336). The progeny of the cross
AaLiSs x AaL/Ss may be expressed symbolically as follows (the fertility determinant
F being omitted for the purpose of simplifying the formulze as before) :â€”
