In other words, there
are (at least not yet) no obvious proxies for the MOC variability or, for that matter, there are
no obvious proxies for variability in deep water formation. In fact, over the OSNAP period we
have learned that proxies for overturning and those for deep water formation can lead us astray
[72]. In hindsight, we now understand the simple fact that to capture the mean and variability of
the formation and export of deep waters across the subpolar North Atlantic, we need integrated
observations for both. We do not see any short-cuts at this point. At the risk of stating the
obvious, AMOC is an integrative measure and to understand that integrated measure, we need a
comprehensive observing system.

(b) Implications of Lagrangian pathways for our understanding of the mean Atlantic
meridional overturning circulation and its variability

We are decades away from the expectation that all water carried in the deep AMOC limb
is channelled within deep boundary currents.
