Interestingly, the density distribution of Fsy showed
split into two. The genome size of a closely related species, that both the sympatric and allopatric pairs had two peaks;
the three-spined stickleback, is approximately 463 Mb [84], however, these two peaks were clearer in the sympatric pairs
indicating that this assembly is likely to cover the majority (figure 3). This is due to the fact that the lower peak is shifted

of the genome. Obtained BUSCO scores were as follows: downward in the sympatric pair: the position of the higher

Figure 2. (a) Past effective population sizes estimated by PSMC. (b) The best demographic model inferred by fastsimcoal2: N_ANC, the effective population size (N.)
of the ancestral species; N_SINE, N. of P. sinensis; N_ANC_PUNG, N, of P. pungitius at the onset of divergence; N_PUNG, contemporary NV, of P. pungitius; T_ROOT,
time of divergence; T_MIG, time of secondary contact; m_S->P, migration rate from P. sinensis to P. pungitius; m_P->S, migration rate from P. pungitius to
P. sinensis. (c) Boxplot of log likelihood of different demographic models. Model 5 is shown in figure 2b.
