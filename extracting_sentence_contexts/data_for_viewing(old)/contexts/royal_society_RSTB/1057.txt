side on which it appears, or may extend down as far as the posterior pole of the yolk,
and take up quite half of the latter (¢f fig. 48). When the protoplasm and yolk are
both dark, as is often the case in Lepas, the first and second blastomeres are, at first
sight, only to be separated with difficulty, and such appearances must, I think, have
given rise to the statement of Lane that one of the daughter-cells of the first
blastomere in Balanus grows down on one side and divides off. On careful ex-
amination and rotation of the ovum, the two are quite clearly separated, as in fig. 12.

Stages in the origin of blastomeres, in the way above described, from the yolk have
evidently been observed by Lane, Nusspaum, and Nasonoy, though the first-named
stated that the appearance indicated the position of the blastopore, while both the
latter would apparently regard it simply as the nucleus of the larger cell. That it
does not mark the position of the blastopore is evident from the fact that it doesnot
coincide with the point of closure of the blastoderm in any of the forms I have
studied ; moreover, similar cells are seen to arise in quite different positions at later
stages, sometimes two or more at a time. That it is not a mere nucleus is easily
seen by examination. Korscuerr and Herper, in their excellent ‘ Lehrbuch der
vergleichenden Entwicklungsgeschichte, truly remark that, judging from Nasonov's
figures, new cellular elements are formed from the yolk.

I did not succeed in ascertaining what determined the side of the ovum on which
the second blastomere appeared, but that it was neither light nor gravity is evident,
firstly, from the fact that light is practically cut off from the ova in many cases ;
and secondly, that the ova in ovigerous lamelle of Chthamalus, which were
sufficiently transparent to examine without disturbing their relative position, showed
