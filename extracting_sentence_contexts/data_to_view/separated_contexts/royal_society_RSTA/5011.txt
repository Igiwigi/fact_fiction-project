Important insights can be obtained by applying the technique of stereo TEM as
reported elsewhere to obtain precise three-dimensional information about the nature of fatigue
substructures in Ni-base alloys [33]. This technique, used in a study of the low cycle fatigue
(LCF) of the Ni-base alloy René 95, resulted in a completely new interpretation from the
traditional two-dimensional micrograph. This stereo image is shown in figure 9 and, using a
stereo viewer,” it can be seen that what appears to be random dislocation tangles are actually

2In fact, a stereo viewer is not necessary provided that the left eye focuses on the left image and the right eye on the right
image. The eyes can be trained to do this by placing two holes in the pictures centred precisely on the same feature and then
viewing a distant object through these holes. Since the rays coming from the distant object are virtually parallel, the left and
right eyes are now in position for the brain to construct the three-dimensional image, exactly the same process that is forced
ina stereo viewer.
