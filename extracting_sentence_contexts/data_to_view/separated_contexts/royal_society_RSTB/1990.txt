One
of them, which is represented in fig. 17, might be described as of an intermediate type,

Vig. 17. Spherechinus 3],
Echinus &

inclining, in respect of body skeleton, to the Spherechinus form, whilst the other
three inclined more to the Strongylocentrotus form. They were in fact very similar
to the hybrids represented in figs.7,8,and 9. For further illustrations of the hybrid
larvee reference should be made to the above cited papers of SEELIGER and Boveri. The larvee obtained in Exp. 171 were even more irregular, one of them being
somewhat similar to that represented in fig. 12, and the other three of irregular
Strongylocentrotus-intermediate type.
