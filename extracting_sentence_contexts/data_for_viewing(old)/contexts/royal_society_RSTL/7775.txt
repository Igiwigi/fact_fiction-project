afford 'the! means of diſtinguiſhing the difference of

happen, that the ſatellite would appear of a reddiſh
colour in the beginning of the emerſion ;, I mean
before the full time required for the whole tranſ-

As to the examination of the number of ſeconds
between the propagation of the red and violet rays,
the two authors differ widely; and I cannot help
aſſerting, that Mr. de Courtivron's calculations are
more ſurely grounded than the other's.
