The vessel was deflected in a
direction opposite to that in which the mill turned. When the velocity of the revolving
mill had become constant, the outer yessel gradually came back to its original position
of rest. This is a fact of great importance, and considerable care was taken to find out
with what degree of accuracy it could be establighed. Owing to disturbances produced
by various canses, the zero could never be determined within two or three divisions of
the scale. The position of rest of the vessel when the mill was turning with constant
velocity was always found to be within that distance from the original position of rest.
