reducing the purified chloride in the liquid way with sodium hydrate (from metallic
sodium) and invert-sugar (from perfectly pure and well crystallised cane-sugar boiled
with dilute hydrochloric acid), The metal, after having been carefully tested, was
fused by a jet of purified hydrogen mixed with rather less oxygen than necessary for
perfect combustion. To avoid the necessity for any cutting up afterwards with steel
tools, the pulverulent metal was divided into a number of little lots of various weight,
and these were supported upon the surface of little blocks made by compressing pure
8ugar charcoal (from cane-sugar quite free from heavy metals) made into a paste with
pure cane-sugar syrup and gradually drying and heating to redness.F The fused silyer
thus obtained was examined for occluded oxygen, following the method of Duwasf in
his recent experiments. Tt was supported upon a thin layer of pure lime in a hard
glass tube, and heated to moderate redness in a SPRENGEL vacuum. The amount of
oxygen given off was less than that obtained by Dunas, doubtless owing to the fact
that his 8ilver was fused under nitre and borax, while mine was, as just stated, melted
on a surface of carbon with no flux. He obtained at the rate of 57 c.c. of oxygen
(for 0* C. and 760 m.m.) per kilogramme of silver, and in other experiments, prolong-
ing notably the time of fusion, as much as 158 c.c. and 174 c.c. I obtained but
34-63 c.c. per kilogramme, and in another experiment made by Mr. SaNTos, then a
student in this Laboratory, the silver having been fused upon ordinary wood charcoal,
but 30:12 c.c. was given off. All the silver ased in the atomic weight determinations

+ This form of support had the adyantage that if any particles of carbon should be mechanically
enclosed in the silyer they wonld be readily een on $olution of the latter in nitric acid.
