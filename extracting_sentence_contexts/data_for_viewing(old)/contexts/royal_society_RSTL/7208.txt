Norwegian shores are carried by the sea to the coast of Iceland, and principally to its
north and east coasts, where they only could get if the Gult-stream turns between Spitz-
bergen and Iceland, and thus runs between Iceland and Greenland towards the south-
west. It would be difficult to explain how a polar current could bring tropical fruit to
the north coast of Iceland.

On the west coast of Greenland the south-easterly wind brings in winter a mild tem-
perature, and this fact is 80 generally known in the Danish colonies of Greenland, that
many of the colonists are convinced that there are volcanos in the interior of that
snow-clad land. The temperature which this current, that in winter and spring is fall
of drifting ice (not icebergs), communicates, can of course not be above freezing-point,
but that temperature is mild, when the general temperature in winter is 8?, 10*, or 12* R.
below the freezing-point. AI these facts together leave hardly any doubt in my mind
that it is the Gulf-stream which runs along the east coast of Greenland, and at last in
Davis's Straits mixes its waters with the polar current from Baffin's Bay. In its course
towards the south it meets the main part of the Gulf-stream at Newfoundland, where it
partly mixes with it to begin its circulation anew, partly dives under it, and runs as a
ground stream as far as the Equator. In a similar way the southern branch of the Gult-
stream, which goes parallel to the western shores of South Europe and North Africa,
joins the equatorial current at its beginning in the Bay of Benin, and begins als its
circulation anew.
