condition of a neutral insulated body placed within an extremely small distance of a
charged body, and subject to the same laws as subsist between two such bodies when
placed under similar conditions, at more sensible distances, and at which electricity
may be communicated. A rigorous examination of this question would probably
elucidate many phenomena of electrical action at present involved in doubt : in the
mean time it may not be unimportant to review such facts connected with this point
as are already known.

45, It has been found, for example, that the attractive force between charged and
insulated neutral bodies is less than when the latter are uninsulated ; that perfect in-
sulators are not sensibly attracted by electrified substances ; and that, in every case of
electrical attraction, the force is (as already obseryed,) proportionate to the previous
induction of which the bodies are susceptible. In accordance with these facts a per-
fectly insulating disc reposes on a charged surface without becoming itself electrified ;
an insulated neutral conducting disc more or less $0, in proportion to its thickness
(42.); whilst an insulated plate whose inductive power is nearly perfect, is charged to
equality with the point touched (36.). ;

I have found in the course of some recent inquiries that the attractive force
between an electrified plane surface and an insulated disc of inconsiderable thick-
ness, in a neutral state, is frequently in an inverse ratio of the distance between the
two planes ; the induction of which such a disc is susceptible being extremely limited ;
that on increasing the thickness the force also increases up to a certain point, where,
under the given conditions of distance, quantity of electricity, and the like, the induc-
tion on the opposed surface remains nearly the same.
