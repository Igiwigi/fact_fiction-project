three reliable data to go upon, viz., PASCHEN’s two lines and the limit. These give
the formula

n = 13480—N/(m+ ‘966367 +m x :071808)?,
giving the following values of obs. —cale. :—
0 0 —10 +4 —3'8 —22

The agreement is much better for BreramMany’s lines, but the last is too far out to
allow 7931°8 to be included in the series, nor can this be set down to uncertainty in
the constants if the supposition of limit = VD (2) is exact for the kind of formula.
If it be remembered that, so far as the matter has been yet considered, the value of
P(c) is never exactly VS(1), and that a similar cause for the apparent difference
may occur here, we may still hold that in fact the limit is the true VD (2), but that
the first formula is the most correct to use with the actual form of the formula

* E.g., in the lines 27215 and 27065 his differences from PASCHEN were — 116 and 16.

(which involves a particular value of N). This gives a better agreement, and clearly
brings 7931 into the series. If we employ Ryppere’s formula,
n = 13458—N/(m+ 99667)’,
