12. Remarks on the Disturbance-variations â€”At nearly all stations whose disturbance-
dinrnal variation curves have been found by the process described above, one or other
of these curves, either the easterly or the westerly, closely corresponds in shape to a
general type. The westerly disturbance- diurnal variation curve for Bombay conforms
to this type, of which the characteristics are, that during about half the day the ordi-
nates are yery 8mall, whilst there is a gradual and regular rise on either side of this
quiescent period towards a maximum, which occurs near the middle of the remaining

* The deficiency in the ratios and numbers of observations for the year 1861 is partly accounted for by the
fact that during an aggregate of thirty-one days in the months of Tuly, August, October, and November the
instrument was acting irregularly or was under adjustment, and the observations had to be rejected. MAGNETIC DECLINATION AT BOMBAY. 373

Cape of Good Hope, and the westerly for Hobarton, St.
