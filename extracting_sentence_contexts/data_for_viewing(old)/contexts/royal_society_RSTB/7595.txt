Winter and spring, 1937-8. In the 21 weeks between the trappings in September and
February just over half the population died off; about 120 animals are estimated to have
been left of which about two-thirds were caught (tables 12 and 19). Eleven weeks later,
despite a greater trapping effort, only twenty-eight animals were taken; in June only five
and in August none. During this last trapping not a single bait was disturbed. It is thus
obvious that there was a difference in the mortality rates before and after February.
From a more detailed analysis, however, it seems probable that the change occurred
earlier (Appendix 2); and evidence from the estimated and observed minimum survival
rates is that the death-rate accelerated rapidly from January onwards (table 17).

(iii) Discussion

The main facts about the population on block Q are as follows (figure 4). At the start
of the winter 1936-7 there were about 300 animals; 120 to 130 were left by May 1937,
and their death-rate probably increased from then onwards. Young born in May and
June died rapidly and adults formed a fairly high proportion of the August population;
numbers seemed little greater then than in the spring. (Table 1 and figure 4 show that the
summer population of 1933 was also stationary.) The rate of juvenile survival now im-
proved, and by September numbers were about what they had been a year before.


534 D. CHITTY ON MORTALITY AMONG VOLES

Severe mortality among the early young makes it likely that few if any had bred before
August. Nearly all those marked in August were therefore first generation young. These
