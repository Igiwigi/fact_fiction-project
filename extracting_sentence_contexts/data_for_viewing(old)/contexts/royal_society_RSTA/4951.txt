(b) Effective computation of Berlekamp’s discriminant

The formulae above do not lend themselves immediately to computations of Berl(F) or &(F)
in terms of the coefficients of F. A computational method can be obtained by first lifting the
coefficients of F from Fy to a field of characteristic 0. To do so, choose an algebraic extension
K of Q such that K becomes isomorphic to F, when reduced modulo 2, and choose any lifting
Fo(x) =40,nx" + aon—1x"—+ +--+ 49, with coefficients in K such that Fo = F (mod 2). If the roots
of Fo in the algebraic closure are 191,...,9, (such that 7; =1; (mod 2)) we have disc Fy =
ag Tigi, — r9j)°- Define similarly disc;Fo = ag", 7 Tigjo,i + r0j)°- Note that disc,Fo is a
symmetric polynomial in the roots of Fo, and therefore an integral polynomial in the coefficients
of Fo—in fact, it is the square of such a polynomial. Furthermore, it is clear that disc Fy =
disc; Fo (mod 4), as polynomials in either the roots or coefficients. Therefore, the expression
(Fo) = (disc;F9 — disc Fo)/4 is also an integral polynomial in the coefficients of Fo. It is now
easy to verify that, when gp is reduced modulo 2, the obtained polynomial must indeed be equal
to &(F), as given by the numerator of formula (2.2). In particular, the result of this process is
independent of the lifting.

In fact, in our computations we will use a simpler lifting. We shall always compute the
discriminants in general settings, where all of the coefficients of F are either 0, 1 or a symbol from
a set of variables V, never any explicit value in F;. Thus we need only lift the coefficients from
F,[V] to Z[V], which can be done, for example, by lifting 0,1 € Fz to 0,1 € Z. The discriminants
computed in this manner will yield the appropriate polynomials in F2[V], and hence the same
formulae will also be valid for any substitution of values from Fj into the variables of V.
