scale n.

(b) Identification of tubular vortices in different scales

It is straightforward to numerically simulate turbulence at high Reynolds numbers by the method
described in the previous subsection. However, in general, there are two difficulties when we
analyse coherent vortical structures in different scales in the developed turbulence.

The first difficulty stems from the fact that we cannot extract multiple-scale features of coherent
vortices by vorticity magnitude or the second invariant (i.e. the Q value) of the velocity gradient
tensor. Since smallest-scale flow structures predominantly determine the velocity gradient
tensor, we only observe the smallest-scale structures in the visualizations by using the vorticity
magnitude or the Q value. This is the reason why we need a scale decomposition to capture :
the multiple-scale structures in turbulence. For this purpose, when we consider turbulence in a :=
periodic box, a filter of the Fourier modes can be used [17,18,21,28] and here we also use the i=
technique. More precisely, to extract the hierarchy of vortices, we use the band-pass filter, 3
