When both altitude
as well as latitude are taken into account, experiments impos-
ing variable nightlengths following a long or a short fixed
daylength (Nanda—Hamner) or experiments interrupting an
otherwise long night with 1h light pulses (Bunsow) fail to
show covariation of either the photoperiodic timer or counter
with period, amplitude, or phase of a purported causal circa-
dian clock [53]. These results led to the conclusion that in
W. smithii, photoperiodic response and circadian rhythmicity
have evolved independently of one another. This conclusion
is supported by the fact that antagonistic selection reverses
the genetic correlation between circadian and photoperiodic
properties within populations in both Drosophila littoralis [55]
and W. smithii [54]. Independent evolution of timing mechanisms over geo-
graphical gradients in nature does not, in itself, preclude
circadian rhythmicity playing a role in photoperiodic time
measurement within a population. However, as shown by
antagonistic selection [56], any putative interaction that links
