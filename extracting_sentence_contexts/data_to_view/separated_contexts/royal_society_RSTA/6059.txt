It will be our approach here too. Notwithstanding its limitations, we will still be able to
estimate the quantum effects from the matter fields and their contribution to the VED, pyac, and
will enable us to renormalize these effects (originally UV-divergent) and obtain finite quantities
that can be better compared with observations. In point of fact, the renormalization group
(RG) flow driving the VED in our framework will be seen to be free from the troublesome
~m* contributions (viz. proportional to the quartic powers of the masses of the matter fields)
which would otherwise be obtained e.g. using the minimal subtraction (MS) scheme and other
regulators. This was first shown in the literature in ref. [57] and further extended in [58]. In
these works, the VED appears as an expansion in powers of H and its time derivatives: pyac =
Pvac(H, H,H,.. .).
