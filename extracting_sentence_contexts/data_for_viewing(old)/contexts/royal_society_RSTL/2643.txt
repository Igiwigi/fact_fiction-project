greatly smaller than the European, is false, By a comparison of the capacity of two Caffre skulls, male and
female, and of thirteen Negro crania, (six male, five female, and two of doubtful 8ex,) the encephalus of the

a plate of it, plate i. fig. 1.

Lawrexct has given (plate viii.) a drawing of a Negro skull, of which he says (p. 363) : © In such a skull
as that represented in the eighth plate, which indeed has been particularly selected, because it is strongly cha-
racterized, no person, however little conversant with natural history or physiology, could fail to Tecognise a
decided approach to the animal form. This inferiority of organization is attended with corresponding infe-
riority of faculties, which may be proved, not 80 much by the unfortunate beings who are degraded by slavery,
as by every fact in the past history and present condition of Africa,”

I must confees that I cannot call the figure good one; and amongst some hundreds of Negro skulls I xaw
not one of 80 bad a form.
