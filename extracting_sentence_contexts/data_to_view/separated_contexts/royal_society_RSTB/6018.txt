Instead, the concha in the latter two forms
contains the acini of the lateral nasal gland, and it is interesting to note that acini are
found near the opening of the concha nasalis in the sparrow. In the mammal, the concha nasalis appears to be represented by a solid structure,
the crista semicircularis (c.s.), behind which the cavity of the nasal capsule extends
sideways and forwards to form the recessus anterior (7.a.), which ends blindly in front,
and thus corresponds to the recessus extraconchalis (r.e.c.) of the lizard and crocodile. In the bird, if our comparisons are just, there should be no recessus extraconchalis,
for the planum antorbitale presses close up against the hind surface of the concha
nasalis, and there is no room; this, in fact, appears to be so. Turning now to the structure which we have termed atrio-turbinal in the bird,
it is at any rate clear that it cannot represent the naso-turbinal of the mammal, for
the latter is dorsal and morphologically median to the maxillo-turbinal, whereas the
atrio-turbinal of the bird is lateral to the maxillo-turbinal, fig. 15,
