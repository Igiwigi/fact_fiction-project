Although this lobe shows
what might be taken to be a greater differentiation, nevertheless it does not contain
more tissue than the same region so formed in Echidna or Platypusâ€”a morphological
differentiation unaccompanied by increase in size. Indeed, the middle of either of the
monotremes shows a higher degree of foliation than does this marsupial. Such a differ-
ence could be correlated with the fact that the monotremes use their limbs in a bi-
lateral manner, while the opossum is able to manipulate his hand-like paws unilaterally. If we apply the criterion for the identification of the pyramis as the first cerebellar
folia to be continued laterally into the paraflocculus, then the fissure anterior to it will
be the suleus prepyramidalis and the one posterior, the fissura secunda. We have,
therefore, the landmark of the anterior boundary of the posterior lobe of ExxtoT Smrrx,
or if we include the pyramis, then the posterior lobe of INevar.
