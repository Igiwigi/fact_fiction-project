L., R.1 (fig. 19), and the still more tapering
outline in U. C. L., R.2 (phot. 8 and fig. 21), both depend on the fact that these
sections are oblique (cf. text-fig. 1, where the planes of section are plotted). The
former cuts the base of the pollen-chamber midway between the centre and the
periphery, whilst the latter follows a plane parallel to and close within the sloping
wall, which it intersects just above the level of the insertion of the pollen-chamber
upon the plinth. A still more oblique section is shown by the Manchester specimen, K,. 14257
(fig. 29).
