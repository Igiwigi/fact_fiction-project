‘g rudiment of the articular pad—between the tibiale and the distale on the posterior
- (flexor) aspect of the limb. On the postaxial side a concentration of nuclei in this
6 tissue (cent. 2’) indicates the position of the second or postaxial centrale.
It is worth mentioning that the articular pad does not appear to be a syndesmosis
(ef: 14) z.e. a fibrous pad formed, like the cartilages it separates, from the common
blastema of the limb, but to be formed of connective tissue, unconnected with the
limb-rudiment, which intrudes between the proximal and distal tarsals on the appear-
ance of the mesotarsal flexure. Its origin appears therefore to support Surron’s view
(50) of the origin of interarticular cartilages, viz., that they are modified tendons
which have become drawn in between the opposed surfaces of the bones forming the
joint. This being the case the question naturally arises whether a nodule of hyaline
cartilage appearing in such a structure can be properly counted as a tarsal. I think,
however, that the fact of the two chondrites which I consider as centralia making

their appearance in this way may be accounted for on the hypothesis that, being
vestigial or obsolescent structures, their origin is greatly retarded.

The hallux (fig. 285) has nearly reached its adult position, and the second, third,
and fourth digits have acquired their full number of phalanges. The rudiment of the
fifth digit (fig. 288, Mt.tsl. 5) has undergone histological degeneration, being no longer
formed of hyaline cartilage but of indifferent tissue. It is also greatly reduced in
size, being only 0°25 mm. long as against 0°6 mm. in Stage E, and 1-2 mm. in Stage D
