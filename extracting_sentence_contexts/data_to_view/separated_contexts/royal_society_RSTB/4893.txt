418 MR. J. BARCROFT AND OTHERS: OBSERVATIONS UPON THE EFFECT OF

comparison involved measurements of the blood volume at the sea-level and at Cerro
de Pasco. Our object was frustrated by the fact that we obtained no constant proportion
between the minute-volume and the blood volume at the sea-level—a fact which, to
our surprise, was chiefly due to inconstancy in the mass of blood. As the changes in
the sea-level blood volume appear to be of considerable interest in themselves, we
give them in spite of the fact that their relation to altitude is uncertain. The most
that can be said is that they throw doubt on whether the effects attributed by other
authors to altitude are really due to that cause alone. The method used was, in principle, that described by Haldane—a known quantity
of carbon monoxide is taken into the circulation by inhalation ; when sufficient. time
has elapsed for it to have distributed itself over the heemoglobin of the blood, a few
drops of blood are withdrawn from the finger.
