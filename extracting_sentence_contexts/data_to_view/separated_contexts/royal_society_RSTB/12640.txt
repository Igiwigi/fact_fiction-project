We find that in the absence NAs), which are not dependent on Pol IV production. This
of the more abundant 24 nt siRNAs, Pol IV-derived 21-22 nt increased overall level of 21-22 nt sRNAs has likely obscured
siRNAs can participate in RdDM. Like other 21-22 nt the fact that Pol IV-dependent 21-22 nt sRNA regions of the
siRNAs generated from Pol II, Pol IV 21-22 nt siRNAs are genome do exist in wt Col inflorescence (figure 1d), accounting
incorporated into AGO1, which is the main effector protein for why they were not discovered earlier. In addition, more than
of post-transcriptional gene silencing. Our data suggest that 99% of Pol IV-dependent 21-22 nt clusters overlap with 24 nt
