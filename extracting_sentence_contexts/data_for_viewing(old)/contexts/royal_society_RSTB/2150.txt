backward extension of the area of innervation was almost identical in each case,
though both sexes were represented. In the instance in which an additional branch
oceurred, the branch was exceedingly fine, and the individual was a ?.

Unfortunately the position of the transition from half to whole vertebrie was only
observed in one case, but Professor Mayer has told me that in the ten or eleven
cases examined by him the last whole vertebra was invariably the 38th, 7.e., the
39th nerve was the last passing through a whole vertebra. The specimen examined
agrees with this. Mayer also found that M. vulgaris is more constant than
M. levis with regard to the position of the dorsal unpaired fins (Maver, p. 273).

Hence the evidence taken altogether points to M. vulgaris being a more stable
form than MM. levis. Now the fact that M. levis possesses a yolk-sac placenta
obviously points to its being phylogenetically the younger of the two species. To
quote Mayer, “ Mustelus vulgaris ist der phylogenetisch iiltere, weil es bei ihm noch
nicht zu einer Dottersackplacenta gekommen ist.” Moreover, the greater variability
in M. levis would lead us to suppose that it was the younger form, «.e., that it has
arisen from a form in which the pelvic girdle was more posteriorly situated. Such
considerations seem to add considerable weight to the explanation suggested above
to account for the discrepaney between the caudal portion of the pelvic innervation
in M. levis among the d’s and %’s, and also for the “ posterior collector.” There
remains the assumption that vertebrae have been excalated in front of the pelvis in
M. levis. Such a proposition would be exceedingly hard to prove, whilst the following
evidence, so far as it goes, appears to tell against it.
