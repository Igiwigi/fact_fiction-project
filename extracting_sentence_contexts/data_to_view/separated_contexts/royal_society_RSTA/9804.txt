In reality, this difficulty was not serious. The conditions during
thunderstorms are entirely different from those during gentle rain, aud to investigate
the two cases is really a matter of two distinct researches. The present research
was concerned with highly charged rain, and so the fact that the instrument did not
also record very small charges was not of any great consequence,

By good fortune, after the first one or two storms, a degree of sensitiveness was’
found which proved to be satisfactory during the rest of the rains. On only two
or three occasions did the boom pass to the edge of the paper, and on each of these
occasions the instrument was under observation, so that a rough estimate could be
made as to what would have been the extent of the deflection from the time taken
for the boom to reach the stop. This sensitiveness gave a deflection of 1 cm. for
40 volts, and, as a deflection of 0°2 mm. could be recognised with certainty, a
potential of 1 volt could be measured.
