The system’s dynamics can be checked in figure 8b, where we represent a slice of figure 8a, for
F=0.14. It is possible to see that the figure is similar to figure 1a, which displays the evolution
of the amplitude versus t for the case js = 0. In fact, in figure 82,b, it is possible to appreciate that
all the regions that remained unaffected by the damping are also not affected by the forcing. On
the other hand, the system’s behaviour in Region IV is the same as with js = 0, once the forcing
amplitude reaches values close to F = 0.14. In the light of these results, we can confidently say that the damping-induced unpredictability
has disappeared and, finally, the interwell oscillations have been restored by increasing a small
amount the forcing parameter F.
