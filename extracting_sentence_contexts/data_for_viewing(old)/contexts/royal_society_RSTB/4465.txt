* In order to avoid any appreciable shortening of the muscle it is advisable to adopt a photographic
device giving high magnification of movement for recording the tension developed by a muscle. Such a

device was used in making the curves shown in fig. 12, of the paper (3) describing the methods employed
in this investigation.

tractions. In all such cases, the actual heat-production observed is the resultant of
the thermal effects of mechanical shortening or extension, and of the physiological
effects set up by the stimulus. This is still further complicated by the fact that,
during relaxation, the part of the potential energy set free on excitation which has
not been used up in doing work is irreversibly degraded into heat. The matter can,
however, be made rather more intelligible by the consideration of a physical analogy.
Tt will be seen from this that, if a muscle, whether excited or not, be released and
allowed to shorten, we may expect to find an absorption of heat, in addition to the
absorption of mechanical potential energy transformed into work. If the muscle be
subjected to a high initial tension, we may expect the initial absorption of heat to be
greater. If the tension in an unexcited muscle carrying a weight be provided by one
part (A) of the muscle, while the “active” physiological increase of tension con-
sequent on excitation is provided by another part (B), ¢.g., if the initial tension be
taken by inactive connective tissue fibres, while the development of tension is due to
active muscle fibres, then the problem is simple, for it is clear that each part can be
