A comparison of the results of the star recorder and the moonlight recorder shows
that the former is much more sensitive to cloud. The clouds that obscure the
pole-star still allow a considerable amount of light to pass from the moon. In fact,
measurable light from the moon penetrates all but the thickest cloud. This is
supported by the results below, which show that the lunar influence on certain
insects is detectable even on cloudy nights. To summarizeâ€”the five methods used for obtaining a measure of the night cloud
were (1) personal observation, (2) Rothamsted star camera (1934 and 1935), (3)
Greenwich star camera, (4) difference between air and grass minimum temperature,
and (5) photographic moonlight recorder (1934 and 1935).
