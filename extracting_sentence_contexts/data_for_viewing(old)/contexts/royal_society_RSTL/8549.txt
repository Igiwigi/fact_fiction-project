towards the letter d as they proceed outwards. I presume that a similar point may have
existed to the left of the lower part of the figure indicated by d'; but here, as already
mentioned, the tissues have been accidentally displaced by some disturbing force
masking their primary condition.

We hall find a similar tendeney to that just described recurring in the roots of
Asterophyllites.

It appears to me that the number and symmetrical grouping of the nodal appendages
round the central axis of Calamostachys is not without significance. In its normal and
almost invariable condition each verticil, whether of leaves or of sporangia, exhibits
some multiple of 3. Thus we have six sporangiophores and twelve foliar divisions of
the barren verticils. Whatever these facts indicate they are in harmony with the
prevalence of the trimerous type of structure 80 characteristic of the stem of Astero-
phyllites.

After balancing these various facts and arguments, I am led to the conclusion that
Calamostachys Binneyana has much closer affinities with Asterophyllites than with
Calamites. With the latter it has no one structural feature in common. There is no
Solitary point in which the two plants resemble each other. The resemblance of the
fertile sporangia of Calamostachys to those of Equisetum has been combined with the
foregone conclusion that the Calamites were Equisetaceous plants, in leading to the
belief that the two were parts of the same plant; but I cannot conceive of any
conditions in which the stem of a Calamites could be prolonged into that of the Cala-
