Tt is the ohject of the present communica-
tion to describe these changes more minutely, as seen by the aid of powerful lenses ;
and to make known a remarkable process of development thus discovered. In order to obtain more exact results, my observations were till made on the same
animal as before, namely, the Rabbit, in the expectation that, if these labours were
successful, it would be comparatively easy to trace the changes in other Mammals. By pursuing the method of obtaining and preserving ova from the Fallopian tube,
which I recommended in my last paper, I have been enabled to find and examine 137
more of these delicate objects; and have thus had ample opportunity for confirming
the principal facts therein stated. I have now procured in all 230 ova from the Fal-
lopian tube. But being aware that repeated observations alone are not complete in
researches of this nature, unless extended to the very earliest stages, I again specially
directed my attention to the oyum till within the ovary, with a view to discover its
state at the moment of fecundation, as well as immediately before and after,

(The measurements throughout this paper, as in former ones, are stated in fractions
of a Paris line, and thus expressed (”), As a simple mode of reducing this fraction
into (what is very nearly) the equivalent fraction of an English inch, I recommend
multiplying the denominator of the former by 114F. The actual sizes of the ova
are represented at the foot of each Plate.
