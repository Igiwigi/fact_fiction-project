Corresponding to the two eg of P-function there are two forms of Q-function,

such that Q/ and Q? NW eo re ave expansible in a series of ordinary Q-functions ;

but whereas the series for ye: aed P* are terminable, because P’ vanishes when s is
greater than 7, this is not the case with the Q-functions. In fact the series for the
()-functions begins with Q; or Q;, and the order of the Q’s increases by two at a time
up to s when we have the principal or central term ; it then goes on increasing up to
s =? ori — 1, and on to infinity. In spherical and spheroidal analysis the differential equation satisfied by P*
involves the integer s, whereby the order is specified. So here also the differential
equations, satisfied by 38/ or P/ and by €;, $’, or C7, S}, involve a constant, but it
is no longer an integer.
