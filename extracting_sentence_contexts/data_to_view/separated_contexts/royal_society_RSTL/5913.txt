But by equation (1.),

49 Ult. + 31 Y. = 51 Blk. + 29 Wh. ;
20 Y. +51 Blk. + 17 Wh. = 88 Em. gr.;

or, which is the same thing,
23 Y. + 58 Blk. + 19 Wh. = 100 Em. gr.,
which is equation (IX.). I have in this way tested the whole of the equations both by theory and obseryation,
and the correspondence of the two is very satisfactory.

20. I may now point out how easily and perfectly the simple fact of dichromie
vision may be made to explain all the phenomena, or as I have called them symptoms,
collected in art. 7, and which appear, when considered alone, 80 anomalous and con-
tradictory. A. See art. 10.
