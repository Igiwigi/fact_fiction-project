These fragments lie as has been said in the track of the
nucleus, and never extend far beyond it. In a few cases a prominence is seen in the
profile of the nucleus as though a portion were being separated off (fig. 24) From the appearance of these bodies, their position in the track of the nucleus, and
from the fact that they may contain bodies like nucleoli, it seems probable that they
are indeed fragments of the nucleus which have been given off into the protoplasm as-
it has moved on from chamber to chamber. It is to be observed that though these
fragments sometimes contain nucleoli, the reticular structure is not seen in them. Not unfrequently after treatment with picro-carmine, certain portions of the proto-
plasm present a generally diffused flush.
