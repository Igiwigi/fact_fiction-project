He points out that it is quite out of analogy with other plants
Bor both male nuclei to fuse with the egg nucleus, and that in Picea vulgaris he has
‘Actually observed that it is only one, the first entering, of the generative nuclei, which
“Fuses with the egg nucleus, the other remains free in the cytoplasm of the egg and
‘giltimately becomes disorganised.
5 Srraspurcer shows also that a study of the origin of the proteid vacuoles
‘giltogether disproves their supposed nuclear nature (vide infra, pp. 417).
~ In 1892 Srraspurcer published his well-known paper on the Pollen of Gymno-
Bperms (9), in which he showed that Betasurr’s account of the formation and
Spehaviour of the cells of the male gametophyte in Tawus held good in its main
Beatures for all the principal groups of Gymnosperms. In Pinus itself, the formation
gpf the two generative cells from the “body cell of the antheridium,” which takes
&place after pollination, was not actually seen, but from a study of the formation of
She male gametophyte in the pollen grain,and a comparison of the whole series of
‘Sevents in other genera, no reasonable doubt remained that the formation of the
‘two generative cells, which together with the “stalk cell” nucleus and the “pollen
Atube nucleus” were clearly figured lying at the apex of the pollen tube just above
the egg, conformed to the general type. The fact of this formation was established in 1894 by Drxon (14) in Pinus
silvestris, Dixon, working in Srraspurcer’s laboratory, followed out the processes
occurring in the pollen tube and pollen grain after pollination. He was the first to
observe the passage of the two generative cells and of the two free nuclei into the
egg. But the actual process of fertilization he failed to follow.
