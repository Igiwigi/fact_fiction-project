Tt should be mentioned that fibres 4, 5, and 6 in the above table had been heated
several times over a range of temperature from 15° C. to 100° C. in determining
the temperature coefficient of the modulus, as described in Part II. of this paper.
The effect of this heating is slightly to increase the value of the modulus at the
ordinary temperature of the laboratory, but this increase is much too small to account
for the fact that the rigidity of these fibres is greater than the other values given in
the table.

The diameter of fibre 2 was found to vary in an irregular manner at different
points along its length. The value given as the mean radius of this fibre is therefore
not so reliable as in the other cases, This inaccurate knowledge of the radius
probably accounts for the value of the modulus of rigidity given by fibre 2 being
considerably lower than the other values obtained. The mean of these other

values, viz.,
n = 3'001 x 10" dynes per sq. centim.,

may be taken as the modulus of rigidity of quartz fibres at 15° C.
