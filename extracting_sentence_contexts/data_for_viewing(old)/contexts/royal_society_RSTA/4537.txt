climate change?

Although the climate community has sought to develop ways of dealing with the various
forms of uncertainty (e.g. [1,2]), uncertainty has often been highlighted in public debates to
preclude or delay political action (e.g. [3,4]). Appeals to uncertainty are so pervasive in political
and lobbying circles that they have attracted scholarly attention under the name ‘scientific
certainty argumentation methods’, or ‘SCAMs’ for short [3]. SCAMs have been identified as
contributing to the delay of regulatory action on many health and environmental problems, :
including climate change [3]. SCAMs are politically effective because they asymmetrically draw =
attention to the possibility that because a problem is uncertain, it may be less serious than 3
anticipated.

In fact, in many instances—including with climate change—the reverse is true: mathematical nee)
analyses of the risk associated with climate change have revealed that as uncertainty increases, :
so often does the risk [5,6]. Similarly, potential surprises are more likely to be calamitous than [4
benign, because the probability of extreme climate events (such as sea-level rise) increases with DN
increasing uncertainty, all other factors being equal [5]. Uncertainty can therefore be a source of [5
actionable knowledge rather than an indicator of ignorance. D&

This issue of Philosophical Transactions is dedicated to examining the role of uncertainty in ,
climate change. Given the inherent nature of uncertainty in climate science and especially in the
probabilistic forecasting of future climate change (e.g. temperature, rainfall or sea-level change),
this topic has received much attention and in fact is deeply embedded in the existing literature
in multiple disciplines, from climate science to economics to cognitive science (e.g. [7-10]). This
issue of Philosophical Transactions does not review that embedded literature, but instead explores
