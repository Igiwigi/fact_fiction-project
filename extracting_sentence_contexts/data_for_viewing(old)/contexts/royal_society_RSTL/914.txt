composition under the circumstances of these experiments. For
it is a known property of charcoal to decompose water, when
aided by a high temperature; and its union with oxygen is a
much more probable event, when this body is present, than a
Separation into its constituent principles. As an argument, also,
that water is the source of the light inflammable air in this
process, it may be observed, that the dilatation in Dr. AusTiN's
experiments could never be carried much farther than twice the

original bulk of the gas.* This fact evidently implies that the
expansion ceased only in consequence of the entire destruction
of the matter, whose decomposition afforded the light inflam-
mable air, and this substance could not be carbon, because Dr.
AvsTIN admits that a large portion, and I have shewn that the
whole of it, still remains unaltered. :

If the dilatation of the carbonated hydrogenous gas arose from
the decomposition of water, the effect should cease when thisfluid
is previously abstracted. To ascertain whether this consequence
would really follow, I exposed a portion of the gas, for several
days before electrization, to dry caustic alkali. On attempting
its expansion, I found that it could not be carried beyond one-
