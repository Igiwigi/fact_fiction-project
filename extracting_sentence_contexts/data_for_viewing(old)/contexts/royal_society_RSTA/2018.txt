28The ‘certain speculation’ here was the kinetic theory of gases, which Crookes’s experimental results tended to confirm.
Stokes to Crookes, 18th April 1876 in Larmor [26, p. 373].

3°Maxwell notes the experimental observation (p. 54) and then supplies the mathematical theory (concluding on p. 83). He
communicated this theoretical result to Stokes much earlier, on 30th May 1859 (see Larmor [26, p. 10] and also Stokes’s Papers
[11, ref. M410].


Iam rather nervous as to the results of your scrutiny. I have indulged somewhat in theory
towards the end, but I think not to a greater extent than the facts warrant.>!

Help was, as always, at hand. Stokes offered to add notes of his own to discuss Crookes’s
results, and to add mathematical theory and observations to relate those results to Maxwell’s
theory. Crookes accepted the offer with alacrity on 3rd January 1881: ‘I felt this all along but I did
not like to suggest it to you knowing how much your time is occupied.’ Stokes’s notes appeared
as an appendix to Crookes’s paper in Phil. Trans. [29].

Crookes’s experiments with the radiometer led him to investigations of electrical discharges in
glass vessels in which Crookes had attained higher levels of exhaustion than realized elsewhere.
New phenomena including the cathode rays thus produced impressed even Stokes:

Crookes has really opened out quite a new field of research in these recent experiments of : >
