a Cavendish Experiment. The success obtained seemed to justify the intention
EB expressed in that paper to continue the work, using a large bullion balance, instead
2 of the chemical balance with which the preliminary experiments were made.

2 As I have had the honour to obtain grants from the Royal Society for the
> construction of the necessary apparatus, I have been able to carry out the experiment
= on the larger scale which appeared likely to render the method more satisfactory,
& and this paper contains an account of the results obtained.

iE At the time I was making the preliminary experiments the late Professor v. JoLLy
& was already employing the balance for gravitation investigations (‘ Wiedemann’s

i Annalen,’ vol. 5, p. 112), though I was not aware of the fact. Later he published an
3 account (‘ Wied. Ann.,’ vol. 14, p. 331) of a determination of the Mean Density of
€ the Earth by the use of the Balance. Still more recently Drs. Ka1e and Ricnarz
fat have devised a method of using the balance for the same purpose (‘ Nature,’ vol. 31,

pp. 260 and 475), and I believe that their work is still in progress. It might appear

useless to add another to the list of determinations, especially when, as Mr. Boys has

recently shown, the torsion balance may be used for the experiment with an accuracy
quite unattainable by the common balance. But I think that in the case of such a
| constant as that of gravitation, where the results have hardly as yet begun to close in
on any definite value, and where, indeed, we are hardly assured of the constancy
