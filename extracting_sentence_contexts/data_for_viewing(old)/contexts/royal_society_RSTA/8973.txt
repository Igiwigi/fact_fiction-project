considerable difference 1-7.

m= 2. The limit separation should give for the first series 38345°11, and it apparently exists
although possibly it belongs to a series commencing with 20559. There is clear evidence of a set
corresponding to m = 1, shown by sounding and giving a sequence displacement of —6,. In the third
series the line depending on the limit change alone would be 38387°56. This gives links u+2°85 and
v—2-87 with the lines indicated or a parallel inequality. They are explained by + 26, displacements in
the sequent.

m= 3. Here 4, as a displacement in the sequent produces a separation of 5. The sequent displace-
ment in the first series is therefore — 6, and +4, in the third. The line 32304 however shows — 28).

m=. Modified links ¢(—3,) are introduced. This is supported by the fact that thé two lines given
differ respectively by 2-37, 2°32 from valués given by normal ¢, whilst the modification of e by 6, produces
2°32. The double example and exact difference give weight to the suggestion.

m= 10,11. Similarly the modified ¢ makes exact agreement, and they enter in a corresponding way
and in both series.
