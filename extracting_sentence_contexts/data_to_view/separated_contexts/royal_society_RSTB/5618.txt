3. Optical Rotation.—Luteose is markedly lavorotatory. Because of the fact that its
aqueous solution is slightly opalescent in the cold the optical rotation was determined
in a jacketed tube at 90°C. 0-5248 gm. was dissolved in 50 c.c. of water and polarised
in a 20 cm. tube at 90° C. The average of a large number of readings obtained was

— 0-886° for the mercury yellow light corresponding to [a]i?
