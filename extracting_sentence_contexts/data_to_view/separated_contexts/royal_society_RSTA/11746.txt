Even allowing for the exaggeration of
experimental error by the nature of the equation connecting 8 and y, it can no}
said that the intramolecular energy is proportional to the number of atoms in
molecule. The paraffins themselves and their monohalogen derivatives sho
closest approximation, but even in their case the quotient appears to increase
increases. This last fact and the extract below from an article by Professor J. J. Tow
(Warts, ‘ Dictionary of Chemistry,’ vol. 1, p. 89), suggest another relation among ,
f’s that looks more promising.
