13 there was a short glass or tin tube fitted into the opening®, while in 14 the mouth
was covered (air-tight) with a piece of sheet gutta percha pierced by a cork borer; 11
was a small globe treated in the same way. 15 to 22 were all experiments with a globe
of a moderator-lamp, which also had a tube for the ear, one opening being closed by a
piece of plate glass cemented over it. Sometimes a little water was poured in for
greater convenience in determining the pitch, whence the slightly differing values of S.
Tn 15 the opening was clear, and in 16 fitted with a brass tube; in 17 it was covered
with a gutta-percha face, in 18, 19, 21 with a wooden face bored by a centre-bit, and
in 20 with a piece of tin plate carrying a circular hole; 22 contains the result when the
other opening of the globe was used clear.

On inspection of Table IT. it appears that the discrepancy between theory and obser-
yation is decidedly greater than in Table 1., in fact about double, whether we consider
the maximum or the mean error. The cause of some of the large errors may, I think,

be traced. 13 and 16 had necks of just the length for which the correction - R may not

be quite applicable. A decided flow back round the edge of the outer end must take
place with the effect of diminishing the value of «. In order to test this explanation, a
piece of millboard was placed over the outer end of the tube in 16 to represent the
infinite plane. A new estimation of 7, as honest as possible, gave n=137, which would
considerably diminish the error. I fancied that I could detect a decided difference in
the resonance according as the millboard was in position or not; but when the theo-
retical result is known, the difficulty is great of making an independent observation.
In 15 and 22, where the apertures of the globe were used clear, the error is, I believe,
