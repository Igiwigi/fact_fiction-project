The use of gelatine necessarily
introduces a small amount of electrolytic impurity which must have some disturbing
effect; but the solid gelatine used in making the jellies contains less than “5 per cent. Sof its weight of mineral matter, and a plain 12 per cent. jelly was found to have a
‘gonductivity so small as to be practically negligible in comparison with those of the
‘Balt jellies used for experiment. That this is so is shown by the results obtained ;
Sut the fact that the best available gelatine has some conductivity of its own would
Antroduce a real difficulty in any attempt to apply the method to solutions of small

“She copper.” This is certainly not the colour of the copper ion.
