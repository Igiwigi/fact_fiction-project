In continuation of our former minute analysis of the excitable region of the cerebral
cortex, we have explored the so-called centres for the facial, lingual, and pharyngeal
movements, or as we prefer to speak of them collectively, the facial area. This
district, as will presently be seen, has been mapped out by numerous investigators,
and its general limits are fairly well understood; but as we have found in the
course of our investigations several points untouched, especially relating to the

movements in the cerebral cortex, we have, in order to avoid discrepancies in the
arrangement of the sulci, employed only the same variety of Monkey, viz., Macacus
sinicus. In all we have performed twenty experiments.
