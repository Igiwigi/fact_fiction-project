abdominal vein. During their course each receives a series of factors
(A. I-VI).

A. Land I. Vene purietales.—Just as the pelvic vein turns laterally it receives
a couple of small factors from the posterior parietes.

A. IIL Vena cutanea magna (Berucr) (text-figs. 9 and 13).—The great
cutaneous vein arises from the pelvic just in front of the point where this
vessel crosses the femoral nerve. It pierces the muscles and passes forwards
in the subcutaneous tissue of the latero-dorsal body wall to the scapular
region. Here, again, as pointed out above, it leaves its subcutaneous
position, and piercing the muscles, flows into the axillaris vein laterally to
the azygos vein. In spite of the fact that its posterior connections are
somewhat different, it is no doubt homologous with the V. cutanea magna of
the Urodela Salamandra, Triton, ete., as described by Brruar (11).

A. IV. Vena cutanea lateralis (text-figs. 9 and 13),—The lateral cutaneous vein
is a smaller but nevertheless well marked vein coming from the skin of the
lateral body wall. It joins the pelvic shortly after the great cutaneous
vein.

A. V. Vena parietalis lateralis (Lateral abdominal, Bepparp) (text-figs. 9 and
13).—This vein is described by Bepparp (/oe. cit.) in a number of Lacertilian
forms and appears to be a constant factor of the pelvics, although exhibiting
a varying degree of development in different species. It has been termed
