syncytium, though I incline to the belief that the trophoblastic mass in the earliest
stages available is cellular and not syncytial in character, and that the framework has
been laid down between its constituent elements. Whether or not this framework is
in any way related to the cuticular border with which the trophoblast of Loris is provided,
I will not attempt here to decide.

As may be seen from fig. 36, the “ units’? do not completely fill the compartments in
which they lie ; they may project more or less freely from one of the enclosing walls or they
may extend across the middle part of a compartment. Spaces are thus left around
them, and it is these which give to the tissue its characteristic vacuolated appearance.

Nowhere else in the Primates has an ectoplacental trophoblast of this peculiar type
been found to occur, and equally remarkable is the fact that the part of the trophoblast
of the blastocyst concerned in its formation and corresponding to the cytotrophoblast
of the ectoplacental area in the higher Primates is completely used up in its formation
by the time the blastocyst has reached a diameter of + 0-5 mm., so that the tropho-
blastic mass must depend for its further growth on its own inherent capacity. Moreover,
once it is established, it never exhibits the invasive properties we associate with this
layer in the higher Primates. Apart from sending out basally a stalk-like process, and
apart from a noteworthy increase in size, its growth-activity is.of the non-invasive order.
The ectoplacental trophoblastic mass of the early Tarsius blastocyst is thus sharply dis-
tinguishable from that of all the other Primates by the following features: its massive
form, its strictly localised character, and its deep subepithelial position in the endo-
metrium ; its peculiar histological structure, the early and complete incorporation in it
of the parent cytotrophoblastic layer, and its lack, once it is established, of actively
