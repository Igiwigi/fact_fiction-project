Computers can simulate directly billions of atoms for times of
nanoseconds. Experiments deal with 107° atoms and time scales from milliseconds to seconds
or more. Thus, the fact that Slepyan’s framework makes it possible to work in the limit of infinite
time and infinite numbers of atoms makes the toy calculations in some significant respects more
realistic than billion-atom direct simulation. The qualitative picture that emerges from results such as those in figure 6 is illuminating. Expect zero-temperature cracks to be trapped in metastable minima for loading conditions above
the Griffith threshold.
