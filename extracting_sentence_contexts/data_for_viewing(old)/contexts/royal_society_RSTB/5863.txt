which covers the real striatum with a hyperstriatal layer as it was called by EpincEr,
Wa LENBERG and Homes (1903), which, increasing, soon fills up nearly the whole ventricle,

Although this ventricular growth of the mantle may be favoured by the neurobiotactic
influence of the numerous fibres ascending to it from the thalamus and other fibres
connecting it with the underlying striatum—as Extior Smrru (1919) stated—this
factor probably is not the only one. ‘

Mechanical factors may play a part. The first, a local one, is the fronto-lateral
pressure of the large eyes on the brain. This not only prevents a free extension
of the forebrain in frontal direction but it also lifts up the brain, thus influencing the
angle of the brain-axis to the foramen magnum (cf. Kienzt, 1918). The other factor,
a general one, is the large quantity of the brain, together with the fact that the chondro-
cranium ossifies in a very early embryonic period and that the skull, especially the
neurocranium synostoses early, the sutures having disappeared in nearly all birds in a
few months (KrumBAcH, 1927). While the adult brain weight (of the chick) is acquired
after 5 months, the brain increase between the 2nd and 5th months is still about half the
brain weight of the 2 months chicken (Latimer, 1925). Besides, the indice de valeur
cérébralet in the newborn chicken is only 0-68 of the adult.

So, whereas in Teleosts only a dorso-ventral compression in the larval stages causes
the intraventricular growth, in birds the influence of the brain case or of the head as a
whole may be responsible for it. Also, this influence does not assert itself in the earlier
stages but somewhat later, when the brain- mass increases far more than the skull, which
is the opposite of what occurs in Teleostomes. To realize the exceptional quantity of the
