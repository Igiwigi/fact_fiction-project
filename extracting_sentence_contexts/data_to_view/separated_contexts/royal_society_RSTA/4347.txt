Time of flight delays are perhaps the most common approach [46]. Computation in
general, even at very high speeds, is more efficient and cost effective using electronics than
optical technologies, unless very few, simple operations are involved [47]. From a fundamental
standpoint in fact, electronics is in principle more efficient, being limited by Johnsonâ€”-Nyquist
thermal noise, whereas optics is limited by the photon energy. Thus, the challenge becomes how
to use each of these technologies in ways that provide the best overall efficiency and performance. The hybrid approach creates a platform through which the optics can be programmatically : =
implemented based on the service requirements.
