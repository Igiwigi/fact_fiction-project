Accordingly, the smaller the actual proportion s(t) of Infectious, the bigger the relative error will
be. Second, if the number (N’ — I) = (S + E + R) of people without symptoms typically outweighs
the Infectious by far, one may assume that aq(S + E + R) =aq(N’ — I) > (1 — B)pl and q(N’ — 1) >
pl. In this case, we get

ea P44). (3.9)

In both cases, we can see that the relative error increases with the inverse of the proportion s
of Infectious. Accordingly, the relative error € increases with the number of healthy people. This
relative error might be huge. In fact, it is particularly big in cases of ‘mild’ epidemics characterized
by s(t) ~ 0. Again, given the finite value of the false positive rate a, mass testing of people who feel
healthy is not really advised, unless appropriate statistical corrections are done. It might lead to a
large overestimation of the actual disease rate. That is, the state of the epidemic may be wrongly
assessed.

However, there is a correction formula for the effect of false positives and negatives, and for
biased samples with p ¥ q. Similar to the correction for testing errors and biases introduced in [20],
to estimate the fraction of unhealthy people correctly, we need to find a function S, that transforms
the estimate $ into s. Considering that the estimate § of s is given by (3.3) and that we have s = 1/N’
with N’ =(S +E +1+R), under the previously made assumption (1 — £’) =a we find

(1 = B)ps + ag(] ~ s)_
