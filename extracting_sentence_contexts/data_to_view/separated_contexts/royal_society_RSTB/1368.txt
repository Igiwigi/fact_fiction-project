Traces of the
same arrangement are found in other specimens, both rootlets and larger roots.t
In some of the latter the thin-walled layer is two cells thick. Outside this comes
the functional endodermis, and sometimes all three layers are in radial seriation. Too much stress must not be laid on these facts, which are not absolutely constant. At the same time they are not without interest, for we know that in the roots
2 of Hquisetum there is no pericycle, but a double endodermis, in which the outer
& layer alone has the typical endodermal structure, while the inner layer is thin-
= walled, and gives rise to the rootlets.{ If the indications above mentioned are to be
£ trusted it would appear that the same may have held good for the roots of Calamites,
in which case we should have to speak of the thin-walled layer immediately sur-
rounding thé stele, not as pericycle, but as inner endodermis. The cortex of the rootlets does not differ from that of the larger roots.
