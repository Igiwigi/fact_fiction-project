The maximum at Giza was sustained for some time, but at Korashia the
curve begins to fall again as soon as the maximum has been attained; this fall was
due to secondary causes which we need not discuss. The feature of interest is that
the employment of richer land than that used for the Spacing Experiment has
greatly increased the height of the maximum. We saw that two successive years under cotton had not lowered the height of
the maximum to any marked extent, in fig, 18 of Part I, and we noted that this
might well have been due to the fact that we were using land which had been “let
down” already to somewhere near its natural minimum fertility. This latter
deduction is supported by the close resemblance between the maximum at Talbia and
at Giza (fig. 6), the former also having been poor land, as shown by the published
account of its manurial composition. On comparing these low maxima with the value
of 0°8 attained in Terrace I during 1909 (fig. 3), where the soil had been freshly
manured with care, and with the subsequent lowering of the maximum on the
Terraces in 1910 and 1911,-even after the water-shortage effects have been
eliminated, this conclusion is further supported.
