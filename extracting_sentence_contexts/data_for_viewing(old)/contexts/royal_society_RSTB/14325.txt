Marsupial mammals and several eutherian mammals,
such as ungulates (e.g. pig), most carnivores (e.g. dog) and
some rodents (squirrel), have blastocyst embryos with an
exteriorized epiblast. They typically exhibit amniogenesis by
folding [21], similar to what is observed in chicken. Interest-
ingly, humans, several non-human primates, some bats and
some rodents (guinea pig and hedgehog) that have blastocyst
embryos with an internalized inner cell mass/epiblast exhibit
amniogenesis by cavitation (figure 1b) [21]. It can be hypoth-
esized that the position of the inner cells mass determines
the type of amnion formation. However, rodents such as the
mouse that also exhibit an internalized inner cell mass show
amniogenesis by folding (figures 1b and 2). In fact, mouse
embryos form a single posterior amniochorionic fold during
gastrulation (figures 1b, 2b and 2c) [6].

During the cavitation process, a proamniotic cavity is
formed in the apical-basal polarized epiblast, forming an
embryonic sac with dorsally squamous amniotic ectoderm
and ventrally columnar epiblast. In human and non-primate
embryos, it has recently been demonstrated that the amniotic
ectoderm instructs the onset of gastrulation in posterior
epiblast via BMP4 signalling [23,24].

It has been proposed that a separation is needed between
