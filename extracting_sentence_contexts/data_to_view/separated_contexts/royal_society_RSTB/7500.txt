Non-linear equations will be used. It must be admitted that the biological examples which it has been possible to give in
the present paper are very limited. This can be ascribed quite simply to the fact that
biological phenomena are usually very complicated. Taking this in combination with the
relatively elementary mathematics used in this paper one could hardly expect to find that
many observed biological phenomena would be covered. It is thought, however, that the
imaginary biological systems which have been treated, and the principles which have been
discussed, should be of some help in interpreting real biological forms.
