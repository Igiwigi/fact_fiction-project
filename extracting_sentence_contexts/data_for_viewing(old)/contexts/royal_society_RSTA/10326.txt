Cape, and —11°°7 at Karasjok. If there were no interchange of air between the ocean
and the interior of the land the latter would of course have a very low temperature.
This became very noticeable during periods of calm weather, for the temperature
would then run down to very low values, reaching on several occasions —40° C.,
while, on the contrary, whenever the wind rose the temperature rose also.

When there was no wind, a cap of very cold air would form over the land, causing a
nearly permanent temperature inversion. Although I could not observe this inversion
instrumentally—neither kites nor balloons forming part of my equipment—there could
be little doubt as to its reality. On September 30th, with an air-temperature of
—6° C., a bright rainbow was observed. Then again, on descending the high banks
of the river, one felt at once the cold air collected in the river basin, and the Lapps
stated that it was seldom as cold on the hills as in the valleys. Then, again, the fact
that a wind was always accompanied by mild weather also points to the cold of still
weather being confined to a layer of air of no considerable depth lying over the surface.
This condition of things almost entirely prevented the formation of ascending currents
of air, so causing very small values of the amount of precipitation and almost entirely
preventing the formation of low clouds during the winter. It also had a very marked
effect on the electrical condition of the atmosphere, to which reference will be made
later.

During the summer the weather conditions were very similar to those of England,
with the exception that the precipitation was very much less and thunderstorms were
searee. On three days only was thunder heard and lightning was not seen once.
