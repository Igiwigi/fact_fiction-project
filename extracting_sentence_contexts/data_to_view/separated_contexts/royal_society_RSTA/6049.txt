In this paper, we review the dynamical evolution and
physical properties of a class of higher-dimensional
models analysed in [1-7].

Our motivation for studying higher-dimensional models stems from the fact that they propose
alternative approaches towards understanding and hopefully improving our view on challenging
issues in cosmology and particle physics. In this review, specifically, we focus on a class of brane-
world models that offers interesting implications on the cosmological constant problem (hereafter
abbreviated as cc-problem). The cc-problem arises from the disagreement between predictions from quantum field theories
and observations regarding the value of the cosmological constant.
