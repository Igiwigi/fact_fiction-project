dilution of an antibody-antigen complex, before combination is fully completed,
causes dissociation, leading to the production of free antigen, and the imbibing of
fresh plant juice might dilute a partially formed antibody-virus complex.

The increase in percentage infection with time on healthy plant might also be
explained, if in some aphids the virus circulates more slowly than in others, but this
should not influence percentage infection after long periods on the infected plant.
Another possibility is that the susceptibility of the plant tissues increases as the result
of continuous injury by penetration of the stylets into increasing numbers of cells.

5—Consecutive Infection

The fact that aphids are capable of infecting two consecutive healthy plants
without intermediate access to a source of infection makes it extremely doubtful
that infection is caused by contamination from the outside of the stylets as HoGGAN
(1933) and several other workers have suggested. This is in agreement with the
conclusions from previous experiments on artificial feeding of Myzus persicae
(Hamivton, 1935).

There seems to besome disparity between the consecutive infection results for Hy. III
and those of other workers for otherwise similar viruses. HoGGan (1933) obtained
no consecutive infection with cucumber mosaic after from 2 to 48 hours’ feeding on
the first healthy plant. Dootrrrte and WALKER (1928) with the same virus state
that none occurred after 10 to 20 minutes’ feeding, but the actual figures are not
