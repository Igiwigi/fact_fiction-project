PD due to proposed new legislation allowing some level of
development in protected areas.

Using the ecologically and economically important plant
family Leguminosae, Buerki et al. [44] examine biodiversity
patterns on the island of Madagascar, where less than 10%
of the original vegetation remains. They found that species dis-
tribution and community PD are influenced by the boundaries
of watersheds, which allow them to identify a network of refu-
gia and dispersal corridors that are crucial to alleviate the
effect of future climate changes on species. They conclude by
emphasizing that integrating ecological factors in conservation
science is essential, referring in particular to the fact that
extinction risk assessment for plants should take into account
the extinction risks associated with their dispersers [44].

The last two case studies reported here focus on bird diver-
sity. In the first one, Redding etal. [59] are interested in
determining how metrics of evolutionary diversity used at
the global scale are valuable for setting conservation scenarios
at the community level, which they evaluate by comparing
how three evolutionary diversity measures [59] capture evol-
utionary and functional diversity of Neotropical and Nearctic
birds. They identify a relatively new approach named average
pairwise distance (APD) as potentially suitable to set conserva-
