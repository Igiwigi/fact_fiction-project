bulk of the fasciculi, at these two epochs, remains nearly the same.

Of the Extremities of the Primitive Fasciculi, and their union to other Structures.

'This has always been a subject of considerable interest, and an examination of it
is necessary to complete the idea of a primitive fasciculus. I presume it to be well
understood, that all fasciculi of voluntary muscle are fixed immediately to some tissue
analogous to the fibrous. Such at least is the case in the higher classes, and in the
lower it is probably universally true. The gross form under which this fibrous tissue
is arranged, it is not my purpose to speak of, as nothing more is here intended than
to inquire how the minute fibrils are disposed at their attachment to the fasciculi, and
how these fasciculi terminate. The observations which follow are few in number,
and it must be left for the future to determine how far the facts elicited are of ge-
neral application.

In Mammalia and Birds, it will always be found a very difficult task to detach
from the mass a small set of tendinous fibrille, with the primitive fasciculi belonging
to them, in such a way as to gain an unequivocal view of their union ; and all my at-
tempts to do this have hitherto failed. This result is to be attributed to the smallness
of the fasciculi, and to the abundance and intricacy of the cellulo-vascular net-work
by which they are commonly surrounded, these circumstances tending to prevent the
disengagement of the individual fasciculi, and therefore of the minute detachment of
tendinous fibrille with which each is furnished. In Fish, neither of these obstacles
occurs, and accordingly in this class the most satisfactory evidence on the subject is
to be found. So many deceptive appearances are apt to present themselves in an in-
