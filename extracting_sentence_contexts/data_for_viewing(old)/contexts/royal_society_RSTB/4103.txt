a long continental projection from Africa. This being so, we have divided the plants
of Ceylon into three groups to make the comparisons that follow. In the first place
we have taken those that are endemie to Ceylon only, of which, as we have already
said, there are 809. In the second we have taken those that are only found in
Ceylon and Peninsular India; of these there are 492, and it may reasonably be taken
for granted that they are on the whole older than the first. The third group, which
comprises 1508 plants, is composed of those that have a wider distribution than
this—not necessarily very much wider, but still going beyond the limits we have
marked out for the second group, e.g., into Assam,

Now, if we take the distribution of these three groups in point of commonness, as
given in TrIMeN’s Flora, we arrive at a somewhat unexpected and remarkable result.
I had long known, and in fact published, that the endemics were rarer than the
others, but was agreeably surprised when the final totals came out with such
arithmetical precision as they actually show.
