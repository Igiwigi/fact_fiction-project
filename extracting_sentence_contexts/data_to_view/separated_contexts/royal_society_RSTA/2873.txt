thus finds these values of .f:—

Argon 2°501, Helium 2°507. I proceed to discuss briefly the case of polyatomic gases. It is immediately obvious
that the present theory does not apply here, for C, in actual fact differs widely from
its value for the monatomic gas contemplated in the foregoing calculations (this is
not to say that fis not equal to } for any polyatomic gas, but merely that our theory
leaves the question perfectly open). The same remark applies to any theory which
supposes the molecules to be devoid of internal energy—in particular to Meyer's
theory. But the latter has derived all its support from polyatomic gases.
