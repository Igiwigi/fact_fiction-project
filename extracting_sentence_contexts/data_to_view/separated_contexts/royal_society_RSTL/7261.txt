| nodified, and the nature of the alterations encountered tends only to ally them more
: logely by organization as well as habitat to the members of the class Echinodermata. The remarkable tenacity of life, and power of resuming all their vital manifestations
-ifter the most prolonged period of desiccation and torpidity, possessed by some of the
Yee Nematoids, in common with the Rotifera, make them objects of extreme interest
*o the biologist, which interest, certainly, suffers no diminution from the fact that, so far
is T have observed, this extraordinary attribute is possessed only by members of the four
and and freshwater genera, Tylenchus, Aphelenchus, Plectus, and Cephalobus, whilst other
epresentatives of the family are frail, and unable to recover even after the shortest
Spriods of desiccation. My observations on the anatomy of the parasitic Nematoids have been conducted
Fore or less fully upon twenty-six species, 80me of which belong to each of the seven
Ections into which DuJarDix® divided the order, though I have studied most completely
zEven species of the genus Ascaris, and of these especially Ascaris lumbricoides and
A megalocephala. Tn many important particulars these observations are in accordance
