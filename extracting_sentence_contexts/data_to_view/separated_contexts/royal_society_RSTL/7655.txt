In the first place, it is seen that, as in the type, there is
scarcely any change during the night hours, and that the main variation occurs during
half the day, in this case between eighteen hours and six hours ; secondly, the range of
variation differs from about half a minute to nearly one minute of arc; thirdly, the hour
of noon is that at which the deviations due to this variation pass through zero, and on
each side of which the inflections of the curve are inversely, but in respect to north-
latitude stations symmetrically disposed ; fourthly, the turning-points are twenty-one
hours and three hours, the former being a maximum and the latter a minimum for north-
latitude stations from January to June, and for south-latitude tations from TJ uly to
December, and vice vers, for north-latitude tations from July to December, and for
south-latitude stations from January to June. The concurrent testimony of the five
widely distributed north-latitude stations leaves, I think, very little room for doubt that
this inequality is an expression of real phenomena common to the whole of the northern
magnetic hemisphere. From the general agreement, qualified by the fact that the after-
noon inflections are comparatively much subdued, of the curves of two stations of swch
comparative proximity as St. Helena and the Cape of Good Hope, it would be less 8afe
to generalize as to the southern magnetic hemisphere ; but there is abundant evidence
of the existence of a definite, and in some respects different law to that which prevails
in the northern hemisphere to encourage further inquiry in this direction*. $0 far as

® An examination of the Hobarton observations (including all disturbances) resulted in a curye corresponding
closely with those of the north-latitude stations, but of small range.
