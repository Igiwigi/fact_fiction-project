The second paradigm, community structure [5,19], again
involves a continuous sequence of items with hidden groupings,
but in contrast, the sequence is generated such that transition
probabilities between adjacent items are uninformative about
these groupings, and instead higher level sensitivity to associ-
ations shared across items is required to learn the groupings. This paradigm allows us to explore how higher level learning
might occur in the model, and in the hippocampus. Finally, there is a class of learning paradigms, includ-
ing transitive inference, acquired equivalence, and associative
inference, that also probe memory for indirect associations


(ie. associations not based on directly observed item pairings, but
rather on the fact that certain pairs share associates). Although
these paradigms are not considered conventional statistical learn-
ing paradigms, in that there is no need for segmentation from
otherwise undifferentiated input, they share the requirement
for rapid integration across experiences over time and thus may
tap into the same learning mechanisms as the pair and commu-
nity structure paradigms above [20]. To explore this possibility,
we include a simulation of associative inference.
