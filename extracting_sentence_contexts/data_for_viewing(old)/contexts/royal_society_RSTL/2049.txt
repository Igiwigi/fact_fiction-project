respiration, and with it the pulse, continue to become slower; and when it has
failed altogether, 80 that no cause of irritation can excite any sensation, the
respiration ceases, and the loss of circulation s800n follows. In this way the
patient dies in sanguineous apoplexy, where the cause of derangement is a
gradually increasing pressure on the brain, in consequence of which its sen-
Sibility is at length extinguished. Here there is no original disease of the
vital organs. Could the sensibility be sufficiently maintained to preserve a

due frequency of respiration, and nourishment from time to time be introduced

into the stomach, life would go on as in Sleep, till the increasing affection

* Such facts are adduced in the paper last referred to as I believe will be admitted to prove that
respiration is at all times an act of volition, excited by the sensation caused by the want of fresh air

in the lungs; and the more the sensibility is impaired, the want must be allowed to become the greater,
in order to excite the effort which relieves it. .

deranged the assimilating processes as to destroy life in this way.

The accumulation of phlegm in the lungs in apoplexy arises from these pro-
