cells. But in all cases, whatever the age of the subject, or from whatever part of the
skeleton the specimen be taken, the cells and the intermediate tissue become blended
in the process of ossification, and the whole presents a uniform granular appearance,
excepting in the instances in which lamination is strongly developed, or in those
which have been noticed in the previous part of the paper. We frequently find portions
of bone where the osteal cells, lacunal cells, and intermediate tissue are s0 perfectly
fused together that neither can be recognized, but in their place we have a minutely
granular mass, divisible only into lacune and canaliculi and the tissue in which they
lie imbedded. In Plate IX. fig. 32, taken from the tibia of a foetal lamb, the osteal
and Jacunal cells have become blended to a considerable extent, but without the

* When speaking of the growth of cartilage, it was stated that the bulk of that tissue at the epiphysis
increased laterally by the division of the cells, but the fact that it also increased on the free surface of the
greatly enlarged cartilaginous epiphysis of the foetus by a process similar to that by which the diameter of
bones is increased, was reserved to be described in connection with the latter subject. If a longitudinal section
be taken from the epiphysis of a fcetal long bone, including some portion of the perichondrium, it will be seen that
the cartilage passes gradually into a more or less fibrous tissue, which forms the exterior of the part. Amongst
the fibres will be found numerous elongated cells, which on tracing the specimen inwards will be scen to be
similar to the cartilage cells at and near the surface of the tissue, while the fibres will be seen to give way to

or become converted into hyaline tissue, as shown in Plate IX. fig. 30, in which the cartilage is indicated
at a, and the cells included in the fibrous tissue at 6.
