black, but did not act upon gelatine.

When the precipitate by carbonate of potash was acted upon
by warm water, applied in large quantities, a considerable por-
tion of it was dissolved; but a part remained, which could not
in any way be made to enter into solution ; and its properties
were very different from those of the entire precipitate. It was
not at all affected by alcohol : it was acted on by muriatic acid,
and partially dissolved; andthe solution precipitated gelatine
and the salts of iron. It afforded, by incineration, a-considerable
portion of lime, but no alkali.

In comparing these facts, it would seem, that the precipitate
from infusion of galls, consists partly of tannin and gallic acid
united to a small quantity of alkali, and partly of these vegetable
matters combined with calcareous earth ; and it will appear pro-
bable, when the facts hereafter detailed are examined, that both
the potash and the lime are contained in these compounds in a
state of union with 'carbonic acid.
