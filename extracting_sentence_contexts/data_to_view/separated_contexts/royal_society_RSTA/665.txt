The implication for
this rearrangement is unknown, though it may significantly hinder the anti-adhesion property of
the gecko toe [44]. Specifically, though the gecko toe is highly superhydrophobic and stable, even
at pressures more than 12 kPa [9], agitation can change the wetting state from the Cassie—Baxter
(heterogeneous solid-liquid and air—liquid interface) to the Wenzel (homogeneous solid-liquid
interface; figure 2) [9,14,45-47]. In fact, the Wenzel state is the thermodynamically stable wetting
state, as shown by wetting of the toe pad by water after being kept in 100% RH for 3-4 days and by
thermodynamic modelling [9]. When the gecko toe pad transitions into the Wenzel state, the toe
is no longer adhesive [14,45,48], though the gecko is capable of active self-drying by walking [45]. Although the Cassie-Baxter state is the non-thermodynamically stable state, the toe’s ability to
retain this property, even underwater, allows geckos to adhere to wet surfaces [13,48].

(c) Potential roles for anti-adhesion

The role of the anti-adhesive nature of the gecko toe pad, if there is one, is not well resolved.
