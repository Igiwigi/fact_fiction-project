ithe in the affirmative, this would not afford complete proof of the mode of
of Vascular Cryptogams from simpler Bryophytic forms. Few biological
fBeses are completely proved, or even susceptible of proof, under the present
rSf nature. But what I submit is, that the search for answers to such questions
x2 above may, in the light of the facts already derived from the study of the
Bhyta, go far to support the working hypothesis above sketched in its broad
