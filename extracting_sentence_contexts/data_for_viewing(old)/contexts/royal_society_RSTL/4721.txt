in the fourth (Plate XLVIITI., fig. 15, d«), and is gradually transferred in the sixth
(Þ6) and seventh (Þ 7) dorsals to the outer side of the prozygapophyses (z) : in the fol-
lowing vertebrz it seems to take their place, and to occasion a reversing of the usnal
relative position of the zygapophysis ; for whereas in the cervical and anterior dorsal
vertebrae the anterior zygapophyses are overlapped, as in other mammals, by the
posterior zygapophyses, in the succeeding dorsals, beginning with the seventh, the
posterior zygapophyses seem to be overlapped and concealed by the anterior zygapo-
pbysis. But this is not the case; the appearance is due to the place of the prozyg-
apophyses (z) being taken by the metapophyses (m). These latter processes, in fact,
continue after the articular surface has ceased to be developed, and after the entire

A disappearance of the posterior zygapophyses, to project forwards from the thirteenth
W dorsal to the sixth lumbar vertebra inclusive ; beyond which the neural arch is devoid
E of all exogenous processes, save the spine, until the middle caudal vertebrz, where
= rudiments of the metapophyses again reappear.

Z In the common Dolphin (Delphinus Delphis), Plate XLVILI. fig. 16, the metapo-
E physis (m) begins abruptly, as a long well-marked proces, from the fore-part of the
E diapophysis (d) of the fourth dorsal (Þ +) ; progressively approximates and attains the
= outside of the prozygapophysis in the eighth dorsal (p s), performs the function of an
=] articular process as far as the sixth lumbar, clamping, as it were, the sides of the
