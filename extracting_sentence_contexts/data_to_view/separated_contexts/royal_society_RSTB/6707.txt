The sprouts of tubers from all the inoculated and grafted Up-to-
date plants were examined in the following year and were found to contain X” but no
X%, There seems good reason to believe that the Up-to-date at the time of grafting was
infected with X”, but that the virus had not attained a footing in the young apical
growth. Lower down the tissues were sufficiently impregnated with the masked strain
to withstand any aggression on the part of the X* which had gained a foothold in its
younger apical portion. The explanation of the fact that such infected portions,
whether in Up-to-date or Eclipse, when grafted back to President and Arran Victory,
produce only an interveinal mottle and not the normal X* reaction, would seem to be

164 R. N. SALAMAN ON THE POTATO VIRUS “X”:

as follows: The scion which showed evidence of X” is, by the time it is removed from
the mother plant, also rich in X”; the sap which passes into the healthy stock contains
therefore a mixture of strains and as such does not produce the characteristic necrotic
symptoms of X* but a simple mottle. In tobaccos we have found in hundreds of cases
that a mixture in which the weaker virus is present in equal or slightly greater pro-
portions than the virulent type results in a much reduced reaction. It is noteworthy
that when in the following spring the sprouts of the President tubers were tested, they
were found to contain X%, In this case we have an example of change of strain
behaviour induced by mixture, in contrast to that just described in relation to King
Edward where a mutation may reasonably be assumed.
