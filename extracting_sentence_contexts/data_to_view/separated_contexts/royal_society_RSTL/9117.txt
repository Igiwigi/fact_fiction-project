Kidder remarks that the flowers are greenish yellow, not pale pink as T found
them to he in winter. Als0, that the leaves have not the bristles on the faces of
the lobes as figured in the Flora Antarctica, T find them on specimens from all
localities. Moxeley observes, in reference to this plant at Marion Tsland, that the mounds it
forms evidently retain and store up a considerable amount of sun's heat, and that
this fact probably explains its peculiar mode and form of growth, and that of many
otherwise widely different Antarctic plants, Te fonnd that a thermometer plunged
into the heart of a hummock rose to 50®, when the temperature of the air was 45®.
