the resistance. At such velocities the resistance is due in part to the viscous shear in
this surface layer, but mainly to eddy formation in the main body of the fluid. This
latter component of the resistance depends solely on the rate at which kinetic energy

is being given to the eddy system, and is proportional to the density of the fluid and to
the square of the velocity ” (Grsson, loc. cit.).

Among fishes it is noticeable that the scales are reduced in those forms that live in
swift currents ; ANNANDALE and I (1920, pp. 154, 155) directed attention to this in the
case of the fish of Seistan. In fact, all Cyprinoid fishes, the Schizothoracine and the
Cobitide, that inhabit the Highlands of Central Asia, are characterized by small scales
or by the total absence of them. There is no doubt that these fishes have been derived
from normal Cyprinoid fishes with large scales. Similarly in the Andes at great
altitudes the Loricariidee are represented by Arges (p. 239) in which the body is naked.
Attention may also be directed to the reduction of the chitinous spines that occurs in
most of the insect larvie living in rapid waters (p. 179).

There is no doubt that the waters of the hill streams are turbulent in their flow,
and in these circumstances a rounding-off of the contours of the animals living therein
