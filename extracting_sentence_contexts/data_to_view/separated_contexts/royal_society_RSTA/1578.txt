Here, we are mainly interested in Region IV for
p â‚¬ [0.025, 0.04], for which the oscillations disappear and the fractalization is pronounced. Results
are presented in different subsections depending on which parameters are swept.

(a) Effect of the frequency of the forcing

As introduced before, we start analysing the (2,r) parameter space to study the impact of a
small periodic forcing amplitude, F = 0.02, for fixed damping parameter values. In fact, in figure 5
the forcing frequency @ is varied for four values of 1. Remember that for = 0.02, when F =0,
the yellow amplitude basin is still present and the fractalization of the basins only begins at its
boundary. On the other hand, for 4 = 0.05 most of the yellow basin has disappeared.
