The developments would then proceed by powers of 7.

In order to discover what is the greatest value of » which must be used so as to
comprise all ellipsoids, when we proceed from both bases of development, a com-
parison must be made between this assumption and the previous one. Suppose in
fact that

When and £ are both equally great, they must each equal the positive root of
