therefore to expect that the increasing elasticity is directly as the volatility of the
substance, and that by further and more correct obseryation of the forces, a general
law may be deduced, by the aid of which, and only a single obseryation of the force
of any vapour in contact with its fluid, its elasticity at any other temperature may be
obtained.

Whether the same law may be expected to continue when the bodies approach near
to the CacniarD DE La Tour state is doubtful. That state comes on s00ner in reference
to the pressure required, according as the liquid is lighter and more expansible by
heat and its vapour heavier, hence indeed the great reason for its facile assumption by
ether. But though with ether, alcohol and water, that substance which is most
volatile takes up this state with the lowest pressure, it does not follow that it should
always be 80; and in fact we know that ether takes up this state at a pressure be-
tween thirty-seven and thirty-eight atmospheres, whereas muriatic acid, nitrous oxide,
carbonic acid and olefiant gas, which are far more volatile, sustain a higher pressure

than this without assuming that peculiar state, and whilst their vapours and liquids
are $till considerably different from each other. . Now whether the curye which ex-
presses the elastic force of the vapour of a given fluid for increasing temperatures
continues undisturbed after that fluid has passed the CaGNntarD DE La Tous point or
