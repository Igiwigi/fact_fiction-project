Sthe description of the mode of conducting them, and the discussion of the mode of
calculating the coefficients of expansion from the experimental results obtained, will

account of the fact that it is necessarily performed with the two reflecting surfaces,
the under surface of the large glass cover-wedge laid upon the three screws and tie
upper surface of the platinum-iridium table, separated at the relatively long distance -
