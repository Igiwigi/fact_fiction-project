On inoculating trom such a broth-tube into a second, it is found that the growth
makes its appearance more rapidly than in the first, thus whilst tubes inoculated from
the nitrifying solutions required about ten to twenty days before any conspicuous
growth was developed, the broth-tubes inoculated from these exhibited the charac-
teristic growth in about six to ten days.

Although the microscopic appearance of the organisms in the broth-cultures thus
somewhat departs from their appearance in the nitrifying solutions (compare figs. 1 and
2), such slight divergence in form is by no means uncommon in the case of one and
the same organism when growing in different media, and in previous communications
on the morphological characters of micro-organisms we have frequently had to call
attention to such differences of shape, which are in fact well recognised by all who
are acquainted with the nature of these low forms of life. We are, however, able to
place beyond all dispute that the organisms growing in the nitrifying solutions (fig. 1),
and those growing in the broth (tig. 2) are one and the same, for on inoculating the
broth-growth into an ammoniacal solution, the latter (which, as we shall point out
below, actually nitvified), again yielded the same characteristic forms as were repre-
sented in fig. 1. Thus the accompanying drawing shows the microscopic appearance

broth-tube, which had itself been inoculated from a previous nitrifying solution :â€”
