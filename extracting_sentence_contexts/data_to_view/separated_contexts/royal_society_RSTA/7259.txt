The ampli-
tude reflexion coefficient for equal velocities will be independent of angle of incidence
and is given by the relationship

_ pa/pyâ€”1
poly +?

where /, and /, are the densities of the water and sea bed respectively. The value of R will
therefore lie between the approximate limits 0-29 and 0-17. These limits are such that the
multiple reflexions would rapidly decrease in amplitude with increasing order number
and would account for their not being visible on the records in spite of the fact that they
should arrive before the multiple refractions. The zero-order reflexions would be the most
conspicuous, but, as figure 9 shows, could not be resolved from the zero-order refractions. Further evidence of a low reflexion coefficient was obtained from the reflexion shots in
which the records were characterized by the initial amplitude of the bottom reflexion
being smaller than the amplitude of the sound scattered back from below the bottom.
