The change was gradual ; and just as the epochs of land-and sea forming by
deformation overlapped that of mountain building by crumpling, and that again has
overlapped in time our existing epoch of yolcanic crushing and explosive action, 80 did
the great epoch of hydrostatic igneous action oyerlap more or less the commencement
of the existing volcanic era. The more ancient form of igneous action, by which the
enormous trap protrusions &c. were poured forth upon a scale, as lately obseryed in
California, wholly inconsistent with existing yolcanic forces, continued in force down
to comparatively recent periods, as of the Chalk, and may eyen yet be going on possibly
under the ea. But two main characteristic facts remain—namely, that the most
ancient igneous workings were hydrostatic and not explosive, while the existing or
volcanic activity (properly 80 called) is explosive and is not hydrostatic ; and, secondly,
that upon the whole this last or existing form of igneous action (the explosive) does
not, when viewed largely, date back further than to some part of the Secondary
period, and. that a preponderant amount of it is of still more recent date.]

80. It follows, therefore, that a like machinery of volcanic action to that now existing in
our globe cannot have existed in any other planet anterior to its surface having
asxumed such thermometric conditions as enabled water or some equivalent fluid to
become permanent upon its surface.
