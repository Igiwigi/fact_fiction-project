(It is to be
regretted that two better photographs of ridges of wax spheres, which showed greater
regularity and were used for the measurements of fig. 3, were destroyed in an accident
before prints were made.) In spite of the fact that the ridges are not quite straight,
consistent measurements of the spacing can be made by measuring at places where the
ridges run for some little distance parallel. The results so obtained show a much greater

regularity than any of those obtained with cork, either by the present writer or by
previous workers. SOLID PARTICLES UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF AIR VIBRATIONS IN TUBES.
