For if
m;\ be the number of self-correspondences of $S," a single system of S', we have
m\ þ m,1e., mm Þ mm < p,.e., mM < Þ.

185. If S' be a factor system of 8, i is also a factor system of A, the single system
eomposed of the unified aspects of 8. This follows immediately from the fact that the
combined system $, A has the same number of self-correspondences-as S has.

186, Hence also every single system of S', a factor system of S, must be a factor
system of A.

187. A system which has no factor systems, except systems of one unit, may be
termed a prime 8y8tem.

188. If 8” is a factor system of S', and &' is a factor system of S, then S” is a factor
system of S, For let a”, b” units of 8” be duplicates with respect to S ; then we
have &"S >—<0”"S.
