In some cases the fibrous coat is pro-
longed further than usual, being continued as a filamentous expansion into the sur-
rounding parenchyma beyond the terminal extremity of the duct. The foregoing
description expresses the results at which I have arrived from numerous dissections
of the liver in marine fishes; in the Perch (Perca), however, I bave observed a con-
dition of the ultimate ducts which differs from that now described in some respects,
but resembles exactly that which is found in the mammalian liver ; instead of ap-
pearing as minute cylinders of granular matter in which nuclei are scarcely per-
ceptible, these ducts consist almost wholly of small nuclei set close together in a

only ;â€”59th of an inch towards their terminal extremity. The mode which I have
adopted of examining the ducts may be thought by some to he objectionable, on the
ground that the extremities of the ducts must necessarily be lacerated ; but I think a
careful repetition of the process I have indicated, will satisfy the observer that it
offers the most probable means for deciding the point in question ; in fact I know of
no other except injection which can be adopted, and I am satisfied that in this case
the results of injection are not to be depended on. To one remarkable character of
the ducts which has been mentioned I would ask especial attention, viz. the long
course which the smaller ramifications take without giving off branches.
