side was a little greater. One curious fact observed was that with strong lateral
illumination the number of sporelings with two rhizoids opposite each other is much
greater than in those grown in diffuse light. This might seem to indicate that light
does affect the orientation, but it mast be remembered that with light coming through
a slit shadows will be cast by the spores themselves. It must be borne in mind, also, that the directive action of light upon the elongat-
ing rhizoid is so great that the point of origin of the rhizoid cannot be detected,
except when it is just starting.
