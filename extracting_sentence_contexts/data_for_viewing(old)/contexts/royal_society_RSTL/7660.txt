$ 47. It hence appears that the thickness and time of penetration are not directly pro-
portional to one another, but that if one disk of water be twice as thick as another,
the thicker one will delay the heat more than twice as long as the thinner one. And
this fact may well arise from the one previously established, that heat of a high tem-
perature penetrates more quickly than heat of a lower temperature. For if we imagine
two simultaneous experiments in which the heat reaches the middle of the thicker layer
exactly at the moment when it has just completely penetrated the thinner one, *then
the second half of the thicker liquid will have to resist the passage of heat from a source
of lower temperature, and this, as we have seen, implies a slower passage. Neither the
case where the liquid is very thin, nor that in which it is very thick, is the most favour-
able for determining the time t. In the first the margin of unavoidable error forms
a large fraction of the observed time 7; in the second the commencement of the motion
in Q is 80 gradual that some little time may elapse before it is recognized. The instant
of the commencement of a slow motion cannot be s0 accurately determined as that of a
