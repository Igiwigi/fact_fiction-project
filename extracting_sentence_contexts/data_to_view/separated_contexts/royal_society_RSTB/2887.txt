In this he confirms the earlier researches of Horst on the same genus (84, fig. 19,
and p. 303). The fact that in ontogeny the reticulate or synaptorhabdic gill-lamella may arise
by the perforation of a continuous membrane, and not by the actual conerescence ot
separate filaments by a new growth of subfilamentar tissue, does not in reality
invalidate the argument that the filamentous condition is the more archaic, since the
process may not unreasonably be regarded as an abbreviation of the normal mode
such as is indicated by the comparative study of the gills of adult forms. No
embryonic gills were examined in the present investigation, but it may be noted that
the observation of Stepanorr’s on the perforation of the gill-membrane of Cyclas
(= Spherium) (98, p. 27, and figs. 17, 19, 20), upon which Posner’s line of argu-
ment was largely based, was in complete accord with the earlier observations of
Leypia (Cyclas (= Spherium), 54, figs.
