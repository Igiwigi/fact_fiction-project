This stripe is even shallower than the deeper arcuate stripe in the upper limbic
are. Region of expansion of central olfactory fasciculus —It will be remembered that the
termination posteriorly of the inferior limbic are is characterised by the large size of
the nerve-cells of its second cortical layer—the modified olfactory type. If horizontal
sections of the occipital end of the frozen brain be carried through this region, the
following facts may be readily confirmed. Mos internally is the curved border of
the cornu ammonis ; next to it comes the granule region, extended from the upper
limbic are ; still further outwards is the peculiar region alluded to ; and beyond its
boundary (the limbic 8ulcus) is the curved surface of the extra-limbic portion of the
hemisphere. To the naked eye a great dissimilarity is at once observed betwixt the appearance
of the extra-limbie and the limbic portion.
