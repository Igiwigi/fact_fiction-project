in all, but this
observation has never been repeated and great doubt attaches to it. In fact,
Von Houvet has shown that, when using a simple manometer, BorHM was unable
to correctly estimate the pressures from his own measurements. Section 8.—THr BrEeaKinG Stress of A WATER CoLUMN. Professor Poyntine considers that perfectly pure water in a tube with perfectly
smooth and rigid walls to which it adhered with infinite tenacity would show an
almost infinitely great breaking stress, and hence arises BerTHELOT’s measurements
of over 100 atmospheres.
