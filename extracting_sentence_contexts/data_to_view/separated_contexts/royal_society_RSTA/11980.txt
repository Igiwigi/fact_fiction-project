surface which lies between them ; and the total flux for the other part of the s
not near the wire is as we have seen of trifling amount; therefore the alteration
mentioned must be considered to be balanced by an intense alteration .of the abor
ideal flux in the immediate neighbourhood of the surface of the wire,-in fact alo
its very surface if it is a perfect conductor. Immediately this change of the capaci
of the condenser is over, the vector (/f, g, h) will be back in its equilibrium conditi
in which it is, at each point of the surface of the wire, directed along the norm:
As (f,g,h) represents the electric displacement in the field, the intense flux he
contemplated, close to or on thie surface of the wire, when the capacity is undei
change, is the current in the wire. But all these circumstances concerning it h
been made out from the dynamics alone, electric phraseology being-employed only t
facilitate the quotation of known analytical theorems about potential functions, ani
about how their distribution through space is connected with the forms of surfs
to which their fluxes are at right angles, and over which they therefore have ther
selves constant values.
