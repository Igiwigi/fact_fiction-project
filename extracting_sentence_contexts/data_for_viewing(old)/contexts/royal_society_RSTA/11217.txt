Many attempts were made to annul the effect of variation of temperature by con-
structing levers composed of two bars of metals of different expansibilities, an account
of which will be found in the appendix, but all such attempts came to nothing,

The sensitiveness of the instrument is at present such that to compensate for a
change of one part in 100,000 in the value of g it would be necessary to move the
vernier arm through 2°12 sextant (doubled) minutes = 1-060 minutes of are. Also a
change of temperature of one-tenth of a degree alters the circle reading by 3°15
sextant minutes, gravity being invariable,

Although quartz is immeasurably superior to any other known material as regards
the constancy of its elastic properties, it must not be supposed that it is entirely free
from elastic defects. As a matter of fact, it is only just good enough for the present
purpose. One of the great difficulties we have had to overcome has arisen from the
fact that it is only by the most judicious choice of dimensions that it is possible to
reduce the viscous yielding of the thread to within practicable limits, and even as it
is, although the thread of the present instrument has been twisted for more than two
years, and indeed purposely overtwisted for part of that time, we are still obliged to
apply an important though practically constant correction on this account. In other
words, the reading of the sextant are is still slowly decreasing, and though the rate
of decrease is now constant for all practical purposes, it has to be taken strictly into
account in interpreting the indications of the instrument, even when consecutive
observations are separated by an interval of time as short as a single day.

Tt will, no doubt, oceur to the reader that we ought to use a finer thread, in order
