On Plate XIX. we represent furthermore the two annual curves of the same periods
without reference to the moon's declination, and we perceive that there is a depression
in the curve for 1860-61 near the moon's upper transit, as likewise an increase of
easterly declination near her inferior passage, while the curve for 1858-99 bears more
the character of the mean curves for five years. bo

These few facts may for the present suffice to induce those who are engaged in similar :
pursuits to enter upon such a laborious task as is the classification of magnetic observa-
tions for the purpose of examining into the law and nature of the lunar-diurnal variation,
according to the moon's position north or south of the equator. We may, however,
rest assured that such inquiries will ultimately prove to be conducive of the greatest |

benefit for the advancement of the science of terrestrial magnetism ; and I hope I have
been successful in showing that for such a purpose it is not enough to inquire into the
nature of the lunar-diurnal curve variations only for the time of the moon's farthest
deviation from the equator, as has in several instances been the practice.
