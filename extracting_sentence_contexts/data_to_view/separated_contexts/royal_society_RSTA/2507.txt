ZrW2Og is in principle allowed to support RUMs because one of the vertices of each WO4
tetrahedra is not connected within the network [55]. I will make further remarks about ZrW2Og
below (84d).

(c) Flexibility in metal-organic frameworks

The issue of analogous RUM flexibility in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has hardly been
explored, but one simple system that has been studied—Zn(CN),—might point to some
interesting warnings. I introduced the fact that there are 8 RUMs per wave vector earlier (§2)
[21,22]. Of these, two are transverse acoustic modes, three are optic modes involving transverse
displacements of the CN ligands from the Zn—CN-Zn linkage, and three are optic modes
involving twisting of the Zn—Cn-Zn linkage through rotation of the CN linkage. At first sight,
we can imagine that the six optic mode RUMs provide the tension effect for the extraordinarily
large NTE in this material, as has been suggested also for some metal cyanides with lower-
dimensional network structures [56,57].
