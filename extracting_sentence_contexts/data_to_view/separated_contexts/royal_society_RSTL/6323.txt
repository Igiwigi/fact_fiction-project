They contained no Purkinjean vesicle. IT was for some time much puzzled by finding among the ordinary eggs certain spindle-
shaped bodies, some of which were very narrow, while others were 80 broad as scarcely
to differ from the spherical eggs, except by having one side flattened. They were
$urrounded by a layer of epithelial cells, contained ordinary yelk, with generally a
Purkinjean vesicle, and in fact possessed all the characteristics of true eggs. For some
time I believed that, besides the spherical eggs, other more or less spindle-shaped ones
were produced in the ovary of Lithobius, so that, as in Daphnia, the same ovary gave rise
to two sorts of reproductive bodies. At length, however, it occurred to me to cut off
part of a young egg; and I then at once found that the larger portion of the wounded
egg was one of my spindle-shaped bodies, which therefore were nothing more nor less
than the ova which had been accidentally cut through in the dissection of the ovary.
