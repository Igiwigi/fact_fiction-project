2%; and this is consequently the number of
values of Q, or order of the equation for the determination of Q; viz. but for reduction
the order in Q of the N&-modular equation would be =(n +1). 2%, In the case
1=3, this is =4, which is right, but for any larger yalue of x the order is far too high ;
in fact, assuming (as the case is) that the order is equal to the order in v of the we-form,
the order should for a prime value of 2 be =2+1, and for a composite yalue not con-
taining any square factor be = the suwm of the divisors of n. I do not attempt a general
investigation, but confine myself to showing in what manner the reductions arise,

12. I will first consider the cubic transformation ; here, writing for convenience
Fn the equations give

kg? 31

i= that is, PF(+2)—(2+1)=0,

and
kf=Q;

the equation in 0 gives (#0'—1)—4#(1*f—1)*=0, and we have thence
k(Q*—1Y—40Q(4N—1)*=0,
kQ'—4PQ*+64Q?—4Q +k=0,
the modular equation ; and then F9'—1+20(7*f—1)=0, that is, Q*—1 +20(4Q—1)=0,
or 20= SL, which is = = say we have «=Q*—1, Þ=2(1—kQ); consequently

that is

1=y__l-z (Q*-1+2(4Q—1)a)*
1+y 1+z ]Q?-1-2(40—1)aſ?
