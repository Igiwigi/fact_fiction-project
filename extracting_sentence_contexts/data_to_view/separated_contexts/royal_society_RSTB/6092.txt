So far as ready elicitation of
this reflex goes, one finds, however, that it is a matter of indifference whether the
rapidly tilted animal is near or far away from the axis. Moreover, whether the
frog (with a certain compass direction) sits on this side or on that side of the axis, it
always responds in the same way. These facts of themselves practically dispose of
the supposition that effective stimulation involves a translatory displacement of the
otoliths. In order to eliminate the possibility of any otolithic translatory movement, we
constructed a special underhung type of tilt-table, in which the table-top is 2 cm
below the axis of rotation. This distance is about the usual height of the frogâ€™s
labyrinths from the ground.
