Upon these data
we base the statements that descending series indicate that each make excitation
occurs during the period of diminished excitability consequent on previous make,
and that ascending series, indicate that each make excitation occurs during increased
excitability consequent on previous make,


OF THE GALVANIC CURRENT ON THE MOTOR NERVES OF MAN. 975

We also observe that at the termination of an ascending &eries a weaker current,
than the original current will cause a greater contraction than at first ; that at the

termination of a descending series a stronger current than the original current will

cause a smaller contraction than at first. These facts indicate in the former case
diminution of increased excitability, in the latter case a snmmation of diminished
excitability which however very rapidly gives way to increase. We notice that, eateris paribus, ascending series are most frequently observed at
the beginning of experiments (independently of any increase of current strength), that
descending are mosb frequently observed after the nerve has been for ome time 8ub-

S jected to experiment, This probably signifies that increased excitability is more
QA apparent before the general excitability has been raised, diminished excitability while

S the general excitability is raised above normal, and we shall give an observation to
S show that the excitability is raised above the normal, and 80 remains for a considerable

= period after polarization (Tracing 32). L We observe finally that anodic opening contractions a firs increase, then gradually

S diminish, and that it requires far stronger or more prolonged currents to produce the

Fopening contraction ab the end than at the beginning of the experiment.
