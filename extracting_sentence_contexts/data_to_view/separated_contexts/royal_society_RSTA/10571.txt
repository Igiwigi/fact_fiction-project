It can hardly be
applied satisfactorily to an isolated observation or to a short consecutive series of
observations, for these will of course be influenced by their special atmosphere. It
would only have value for a long series such as it was itself determined for, and such a
series would rarely occur in practice. The fact that in both our series of experiments
the differences between the values of the personal equation as found from short series
are many times the probable error of sampling is very remarkable. I shall refer to it
as “the influence of immediate atmosphere,” where I understand the “atmosphere” to
be compounded of all the little sources which affect either the observed thing or the
observer more or less persistently during a short series. I am prepared to be told

that the influence of immediate atmosphere was something peculiar to our own test
experiments.
