V. Summary AND CONCLUSIONS.

The sunspot numbers, it is suggested, should be regarded as analogous to the data
that would be given by observations of a disturbed periodic movement, such as that
of a pendulum subjected to successive small random impulses.

The graph of such a movement presents the principal features of the graph of sunspot
numbers, viz., a surprising degree of smoothness accompanied by a continual change of
amplitude and shift of phase.

It is suggested that in this case the application of the periodogram method gives results
subject to a large margin of error, and may be misleading. Trial on an empirical
disturbed series (Section IV) showed, in fact, that with only 7 or 8 periods results are
highly erratic ; with a larger number of periods, about 30, the main effect is a broadening
of the band due to the fundamental and a reduction of the apparent intensity.

The problem of determining the period and the disturbances, in the case of the sunspot
numbers, was attacked in the first instance (Section I) by finding the best (least square)
linear equation relating w, +- u,-, to u,-1, this giving the form of difference equation
required for a simple harmonic function. The equation gave a period which was
obviously too low. It is suggested that this result is due to the presence of superposed
fluctuations in addition to disturbances, a suggestion borne out by applying the same
method to graduated values of the numbers. This yielded a much closer approximation
to the period suggested by the graph.
