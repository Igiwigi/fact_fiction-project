from structured data (Hearst 1999), text mining has the aim of discovering and
extracting knowledge from unstructured data, i.e. free text. Text mining thus
involves extra processing steps in order to locate, extract and structure relevant
information from texts prior to the knowledge discovery (i.e. data-mining) step.
The advantage of text mining is that it enables researchers to collect, maintain,
interpret, curate and discover knowledge needed for research or education, in an
efficient and systematic way (Ananiadou & McNaught 2006).
Text mining comprises three major activities,

(1) Information retrieval. Gathering of relevant texts.

(2) Information extraction. Looking within the retrieved texts to identify,
extract and structure a range of specific types of information or facts.

(3) Data mining. Finding associations among the pieces of information
extracted from many different texts.

Thus, text mining can dramatically reduce the amount of work required by
the userâ€”instead of being presented with potentially tens of thousands of
documents to sift through and comb for relevant knowledge, text mining offers
the possibility of automatically extracting and presenting to the user precise facts
retrieved from relevant documents. Furthermore, interesting associations may
be found among disparate extracted facts, leading to the discovery of new or
unsuspected knowledge.
