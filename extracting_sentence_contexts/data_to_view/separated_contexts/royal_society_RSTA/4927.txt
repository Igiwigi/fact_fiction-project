VII. The Absorption of Hydrogen by Platinum Black. > Platinum black, as is well known, possesses, in common with palladium, the power
absorbing or occluding considerable quantities of hydrogen In view of the fact,
However, that platinum black always contains a certain amount of oxygen, it is
gnportant, in determining its absorptive power, to distinguish between the amount of
ydrogen which is really absorbed by the platinum black per se, and that which is
imply burnt up to form water by the oxygen already contained in platinum black. dn taking experiments with a view to ascertain the absorptive power of platinum
ack, prepared in the usual way, for hydrogen, this has been steadily borne in mind. The apparatus which was used was essentially the same as that used for the deter-
tion of the oxygen in platinum black, with the addition of the washing and
drying tubes shown on the left of fig.
