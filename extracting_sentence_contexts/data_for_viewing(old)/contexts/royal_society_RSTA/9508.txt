Linequality range to the mean value for the month is much less variable than is the
Gabsolute value of the range, and a similar remark applies to the night fall. On the
other hand, the day fall actually diminishes as the monthly mean increases. At
Smidsummer it is very nearly as large as the night fall, but at midwinter it is only
EX bout one-third as large as the latter.
2b § 10. A positive value in the potential gradient implies a corresponding negative
‘Scharge on the earth, the surface density being given by (2) of § 5. Any change in
‘Sthe gradient implies a change in the surface density. The change in the charge on a
q. cm. of the earth’s surface shows only the difference between what enters and leaves
-Bit. The change may represent but a small fraction of the current traversing the
Zelement of surface. The increment to the charge may also arise from a vertical
Zeurrent or a horizontal current, or partly from the one and partly from the other. As
Sa matter of fact, we know that usually a vertical air-earth current exists, as well as
Sso-called earth currents whose direction is mainly at least horizontal. Earth currents
"sare much in evidence during magnetic storms, but no certain relation between
potential gradient changes and magnetic storms seems yet to have been established.
YThe normal diurnal inequality of potential gradient could be connected only with
Snormal air or earth currents, and information about either of these phenomena is
limited. On rainless days the air-earth current seems normally to be directed down-
Awards throughout the whole 24 hours, so it alone cannot account for changes in the
surface charge. It is, however, of some interest to compare the relative sizes of the
air-earth current and the alterations of surface charge calculated from the changes in
potential gradient. February is the month which shows the largest daily changes in
Table V. The hourly changes in it going to the nearest volt are as follows :—
