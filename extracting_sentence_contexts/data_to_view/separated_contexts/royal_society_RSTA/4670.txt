The metasurface design can be summarized as the synthesis
of an inhomogeneous surface admittance profile in (2.3) that transforms the impinging wavefront
into the desired scattered one. As noted above, the required admittance is generally complex,
and therefore loss and gain elements may be required to synthesize the required real portion
of Veg: As intuitively expected, this condition becomes extreme if the incident and scattered
wavefronts do not sufficiently overlap on the surface, and the surface properties are desired to be
maintained local. In this scenario, in fact, the metasurface would necessarily be required to absorb
energy in one location, and re-radiate it from somewhere else to generate the desired scattering
profile. Fortunately, in many practical applications impinging and scattered beams overlap, and
passive metasurfaces may be sufficient. In order to facilitate the physical implementation of the
structure and avoid incorporation of active elements [43], the required surface profile in these
cases may be approximated as purely imaginary (i.e. lossless), while allowing a high conversion
efficiency [44] to the desired scattering profile.
