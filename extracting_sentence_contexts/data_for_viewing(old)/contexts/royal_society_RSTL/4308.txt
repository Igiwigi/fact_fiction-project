Thus black and light blue are at the extremes of the absorptive powers, and 80
far confirm the results obtained by the night obseryations, as the absorptiye power
of substances is proportional to their radiating power.

But as these results with respect to colours may have been affected with the par-
ticular parcels of wool I used, and different results might have been obtained had
other parcels been used, I do not place much confidence in them ; yet, s0 far as I

whiting, charcoal, black-lead and sand; a quantity of the last-mentioned substance
was also placed on the ground to the depth of three inches, and to an extent of nine
square feet; the difference between the mean readings of thermometers placed on
