When the
epiphysis is minutely injected, the depressions upon its sarface will be found to con-
tain congeries of convoluted blood-vessels, which are more drawn out the deeper the
depression, until at length, in the interior of the canals and their divisions, single,
and nearly straight vessels are found. These epiphysal vessels have a very peculiar
disposition. 'They consist of an artery having a course more or less straight, which
terminates in a dilatation, or in convoluted branches, from which the vein arises,
Plate XIIT. figs. 3 and 4. From the fact of the presence of these vessels, which
converge towards and form convyolutions internal to the articular cartilage, it may
be inferred that they supply the cells of the latter with a nutrient fluid. As the arti-
cular cartilage increases in thickness, and the ossific nucleus which is developed in
the epiphysal cartilage becomes larger, these vessels gradually recede from between
them, and they leave a considerable mass of non-yascular cartilage between the osse-
ous nuclens and the synovial membrane; all of this appears to be articular cartilage,
which is now nourished by the vessels in the interior of the nuclens. See Plate XIII.
