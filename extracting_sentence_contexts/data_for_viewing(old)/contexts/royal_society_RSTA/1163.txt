is usually straightforward to obtain a rough exponential estimate of the form ||T()|| < Le, t>0.
Helffer & Sjéstrand [42, Proposition 2.1] obtained the following useful bound which, incidentally,
leads to yet another proof of Theorem 2.1.

Theorem 2.3. Let (T(t));>0 be a Co-semigroup on a Hilbert space, with generator A. Let L>0 and
4 €R be as above and suppose that w <i is such that N(w) := SUPRe>w ||R(z, A)]|| is finite. Then

IT) LO +2LN(w)(A—a)e", £20. (2.6)

It is natural to ask what happens in the limit as @ > w(T). The answer depends on the rate of
blow-up of R(z,A) or, more precisely, of N(w) near w(T). Assuming that w(T) > —00, N(w) blows
up as w > @(T). If there are C, k > 0 such that N(w) < C(w — o(T))~* for w — o(T) >0 sufficiently
small, then, as shown in [42], one gets sup; tk eM T(£)|| < 00. In fact, one may associate
with every blow-up rate of the resolvent an appropriate correction of exponential growth of the
semigroup; see [24] for details. Recently, using the techniques of [42], the following interesting
result was proved by Wei in [43, Theorem 1.3].

Theorem 2.4. Let (T(t))t>0 be a Co-semigroup of contractions on a Hilbert space X. If iR C p(A) and
0 = SUP, cp ||R(is, A)|| < 00, then

ITO se"™7e",  t>0. (2.7)

Some Banach space counterparts of Theorem 2.3 (as well as additional references) may be
found in [24,44], while several interesting and relevant examples of applications are considered
e.g. in [42,43] and [45, Remark 3.13].
