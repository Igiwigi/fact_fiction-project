Even had accurate measurements been made, it is
probable that the results obtained would have been untrustworthy, for it has been
shown how greatly the larvae are affected by conditions, and even if these had been
kept as far as possible the same for all larvee used for this purpose, yet their effect
could not be eliminated. For even if the external conditions are identical, yet the
eggs differ among themselves in vitality, and the more vigorous would give rise to
larvee which developed characters different from those found in the weaker. For
these reasons an exact determination of the coefficient of correlation would be useless,
if not misleading, but it may nevertheless be of interest to notice some of the facts. SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE EFFECT OF CONDITIONS ON DOMINANCE. 147

Table I. is a correlation table including larvee reared under very various conditions,
for determining the correlation between the number of anal arm-bars and the length
of the anterior body-skeleton.
