This shows that, if « increases downwards at a rate greater than that corresponding to
« = kp~*, and a sudden change occurs in the inducing field, represented by the first
spherical harmonic n = 1, then the pulse of induced current will actually increase in

intensity, as it penetrates (more and more slowly) into the interior of the conductor,
If n = 2 it will remain constant in intensity, while if n>2 it will decrease. The total
amount of induced current will, of course, continually decrease, in spite of the fact that,
for n= 1, the maximum intensity will continually increase. This implies that the
maximum becomes more and more sharp as py is decreased (see, for example, fig. 3) ;
thus (6, 45) shows that when p, differs sufficiently from unity, the current density will
fall rapidly from the maximum as p increases from pp, because of the factor p~"~"~!, and
also as p decreases, because of the factor exp {—7p?~™/(4#)}, and this falling away from
the maximum becomes more and more pronounced as fy is decreased.

7. THE TERRESTRIAL MAGNETIC VARIATIONS

The preceding theory will now be used to show that the observed relations between
the external and internal parts of certain magnetic variations can be explained con-
sistently on the hypothesis that the internal part is due to electric currents induced
