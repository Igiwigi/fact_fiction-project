which can also be compared with figures of the inflorescence of Sphenopteris striata. In
the form known as Aneimites fertilis the seeds were terminal on slender branches
with sterile foliar pinnules below, and a similar structure is seen in Diploomema, GRAND
Evry (1906), who briefly described several forms of fertile structures, considered that the
majority of the Upper Paleozoic pteridosperms bore their reproductive organs on
separate inflorescences. From the analogy of the Psilophytales and the earliest known
ferns, e.g., Botryopteris and Stauropteris, we must consider the terminal position of the
seed as the more primitive, and our observations suggest that this habit continued
in at least one group in Mesozoic times. On the other hand, Dr. Scorr has pointed out
that in Newropteris heterophylla the seeds were borne terminally on a vegetative frond
which was but slightly modified (1923), while in Pecopteris Pluckeneti they were borne
on ordinary pinnules. More recently Professor Hanux (1929) has drawn attention to the
fact that in the Permian ferns Alethopteris Norinii, Sphenopteris tenuis, and Emplec-
topteris triangularis the seeds were borne on the surface of ordinary pinne or pinnules.

It would thus seem that the pteridosperm seeds show a close parallel to the sporangia
of the ferns (Bower, 1928); in the course of evolution some became superficial, but,
on the other hand, in the Corystospermaces the terminal position has been retained
and the inflorescence has not developed into an expanded frond.

(2) Structure of the seeds.â€”Our evidence from the Corystospermacee is meagre, but
some of the Mesozoic species may be regarded as. having been flattened like certain of
the Paleozoic forms. The elongated micropyle of certain species, e.g., U. Macleani,
may be compared with the corresponding structure in Trigonocarpus, but the curvature
of the micropyle seems without parallel. The mode in which the pollen grains were
