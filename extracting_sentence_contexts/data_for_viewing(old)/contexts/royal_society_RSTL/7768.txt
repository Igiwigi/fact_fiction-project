points of the residual curve of intersection, Such a surface is Maz+Ny*=0 ; the inter-
sections of the line z=0, y=0 with the curve z=0, N=0 will be all of them ordinary
points. The reciprocal surface will have a binode, but there will be some special cir-
cumstance doing away with the existence of the directions of closest contact in the two
biplanes respectively. I do not at present pursue the question.

22. For a surface having a bitrope B'=1, it appears from what precedes, that the
oscular line must count 4 times in the intersection of the surface with the Hessian ; for
only in this way can the reduction 4 in the order of the spinode curve arise.

23. The pinch-point, or singularity j=1, is in fact mentioned in Sa1aoN; it is a point
on the nodal curye such that the two tangent planes' coincide, or say it is a cuspidal
point on the nodal curye. If, to fix the ideas, we take the nodal curye to be a complete
intersection P=0, Q=0, then the equation of the surface is (A, B, CYP, Q)*=0
(A, B, © functions of the coordinates) ; we have a swrface AC—B*=0, which may be
called the critic surface, intersecting the nodal curve in the points P=0, Q=0,
AC—B*=0, which are the pinch-points thereof; or if there be a cuspidal curve, then
such of these points as are not, situate on the cuspidal curve are the pinch-points: see my
paper © On a Singularity of Surfaces,” Quart. Math. Journ. vol. ix. (1868) pp. 332-338.
The single tangent plane at the pinch-point meets the surface (se p. 338) in a curve
having at the pinch-point a triple point, =cusp+2 nodes, viz. there is a cuspidal branch
the tangent to which coincides with that of the nodal curye; and there is a simple
branch the tangent to which may be called the cotangent at the pinch-point. In the
