Figure 5. Posterior distribution of the number of inner clusters per outer cluster (a), relative frequency of the inner clusters
corresponding to the Binder estimate of the inner cluster allocation (b), cluster-specific empirical means of the counts (c).
For outer Cluster 1, the latter is only shown for the four largest inner clusters for visualization purposes. Results are obtained
conditionally on the Binder estimate of the outer clustering. (Online version in colour.)

(see figure 6). Notably, around a quarter of the individuals in outer Cluster 2, as captured by its
inner Cluster 2, forward COVID-19 messages to many more people (question j = 3) than subjects
in inner Cluster 1 of outer Cluster 2. Figure 4 also supports the fact that outer Cluster 2 engages
with WhatsApp in a much more persistent manner than the other outer clusters. These results
highlight that a sizeable minority of WhatsApp users has a relatively large propensity to spread
COVID-19 messages during a critical phase of the pandemic. This is in line with a similar survey
in Singapore [38] and findings on ‘superspreaders’ on other social media.

Figure 6. Heatmaps of the posterior co-clustering probabilities for the inner clusters per outer cluster. Results are obtained
conditionally on the Binder estimate of the outer cluster allocation. Observations are reordered based on the co-clustering

probability profiles, through hierarchical clustering. (a) Outer Cluster 1, (b) outer Cluster 2 and (c) outer Cluster 3. (Online version
