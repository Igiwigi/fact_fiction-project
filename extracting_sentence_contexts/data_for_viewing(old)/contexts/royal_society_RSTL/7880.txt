THE LAW OF ERRORS OF OBSERVATIONS. 177

should be s0, it being quite easy to conceive a different economy of nature in which no
8uch accordance would subsist *,

It is possible & priori to conceive that the layy of single errors of observation might be
of any form whatever, varying with each kind of observation ; how far it is true that in
practice one general lay will be found to prevail, is essentially a question of facts—an
inquiry, not into what might be, but what is. Now the hypothesis aboye mentioned, —
namely, that errors in rerum naturd result from the superposition of a large number of
minuter errors arising from a number of independent sources,—when submitted to
mathematical analysis, leads to the law which is generally received; as far therefore as
this hypothesis is in accordance with fact, s0 far is the law practically true, Fully to
decide how far this hypothesis does agree with facts is an extremely subtle question in
philosophy, which would embrace not only an extended inquiry into the laws of the
material universe, but an examination of the senses and faculties of man, which form an
important element in the generation of error, Still, without pretending to enter on a
demonstration of the truth of this hypothesis, a few reflections upon the facts, especially
in the case of Astronomy (which is par excellence the science of obseryation, and where
accordingly the lessons of experience are the clearest and most complete), will, I think,
