Gansrrt denies that the fascia dentata is continued in any way on to
the dorsal surface of the corpus callosum. G1AcomINt's views will be discussed later. It is doubtless of great importance that these stages in the development of the
margin of the porta should be traced with exactitude, but before the facts can be
applied to the determination of the homology of the hippocampus certain antecedent;
questions must be answered, and still earlier stages in the development of ARNOLD'S
convolutions must be worked out in order that we may be placed in a position to
judge whether they are in any respects comparable to the convolutions of the general
surface of the great brain. In particular we need to know the relation which ARNOLD'S
convolutions bear to the olfactory crus and bulb. If the external stria of the olfactory
tract passed into any part of the hippocampus we should have data from which to
