systems can miss important facts about the world, and it is important to verify that systems are
operating as intended and satisfying their articulated requirements. This is the classical problem
of measurement: do data reflect the world and the object of study sufficiently accurately? A related
concern is that of construct validity, the degree to which a model or test accurately measures what
it purports to measure, a multi-pronged concept that connects both actual fidelity to the world,
theoretical groundedness, the risks of performing the measurement, interrelatedness of the factors
being considered, and generalizability of the results [14,43].
