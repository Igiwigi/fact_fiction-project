CLELAND ON THE VARTATIONS OF THE HUMAN SKULL.

breadth to length. The short-headed Americans, the Polynesians, the Hindoos, the
New-Zealanders, and the Greeks may well be contrasted with the Germans, the Irish,
the Australians, and the Negroes, the one set being high and the other low in proportion
to their length: and if the division cannot be made distinct without the use of Greek
nomenclature, the one group may be termed hypselocephalic, and the other tapeino-
cephalic. But the truest expression of the facts will be obtained by instituting a swb-
division of the brachycephali of RerTzrvs under the name of angustiores, to which 8hall
belong the Hindoo, Sandwich-Islander, and New-Zealander, probably the Greek, and pos-
sibly the Chinese. The mere establishment of such a division would set, on permanent
record that the brachycephali have more than one character. But whatever system of
classification and nomenclature be determined on, it will always be artificial to associate
with proportionally lofty skulls, like the brachycephalic Americans, low-lying skulls
with dolichocephalic profile, such as the Germans, because they happen to have a
cephalic index above 80*.
