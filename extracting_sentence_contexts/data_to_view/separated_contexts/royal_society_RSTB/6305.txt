mean weekly log difference ; the standard deviation of that difference ; and the
““¢” test of significance (otherwise the mean difference divided by the standard
deviation). The groups are placed in order of the value of the log difference. The following facts may be noted :

(a) The Noctuidae are far above the other groups with a higher log difference,
and a very much higher value for ¢.

(b) Out of the first six groups four are either Lepidoptera or include Lepidoptera
(e.g., all insects). (c) Families of Diptera hold positions 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12.

(d) Five out of the last six positions are groups that are neither Lepidoptera nor
Diptera. It would appear from this that the effect was at its maximum in the Lepidoptera,
next in Diptera, and lower in other groups.
