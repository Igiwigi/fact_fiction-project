But these are only average rules, and in
individual cases the differetices may be much larger and in either direction.

It may be remarked that if observations of diffe!
law are combined, the effect is to give /, greater than 3, and therefore would imitate a
law of Type VIL without the normal law being in fact wrong. I think, however, that the
right, and in any

onus of proof, since Pearson’s paper, is on those who say that it is ev
case such a consideration would affect nothing in the treatment of actual observations. We could make no use of the fact that a series of observations was compound unless
we knew which observations belonged to each component law. If we did, we should

treat the laws separately; but when, as is certainly the usual case, we do not, it is neces-
sary to use the rules for the type of distribution as we actually find it. In either ease it

is wrong to treat all observations as of equal weight.
