bustion of hydrogene and olefiant gas without flame. In the
same paper I have shown, that the temperature of flame js
infinitely higher than that necessary for the ignition of solid
bodies. It appeared to me, therefore, probable, that in cer-
tain combinations of gaseous bodies, for instance, those above
referred to, when the increase of temperature was not suffi-
cient to render the gaseous matters themselves luminous ;
yet still it might be adequate to ignite solid matters exposed
to them. TI had devised several experiments on this subject.
I had intended to expose fine wires to oxygene and olefiant
gas, and to oxygene and hydrogene during their slow combi-
nation under different circumstances, when I was accidentally
led to the knowledge of the fact, and, at the same time, to
the discovery of a new and curious series of phenomena.

I was making experiments on the increase of the limits of
the combustibility of gaseous mixtures of coal gas and air by
increase of temperature. For this purpose, I introduced a
small wire-gauze safe-lamp with some fine wire of platinum
