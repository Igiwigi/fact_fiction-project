exhibit the phenomenon of transient-induced global response
synchronization (TIGoRS) [33]. This involves the appearance
of a stable correspondence between random samplings of cer-
tain spatio-temporal transients input into the automaton and
the subsequent responses of the automaton. This synchroni-
zation occurs at the global level between the automaton
and the transients, and not between the cells of the auto-
maton. When TIGoRS is present, there is a nonlinear
relationship between the input sampling rate and the
Hamming distance between the transient stimulus and the
transient response of the automaton. This synchronization

occurs in spite of the fact that the underlying rule space of
the automaton is constantly changing. The presence of
TIGoRS demonstrates that finite duration spatio-temporal
transients are the proper dynamical states to be studied. In
the presence of TIGORS, the dynamical action on these tran-
sients causes the dispositional cellular automaton to act as a
primitive stimulus-response system [33].

In addition, the nervous system is riddled with intrinsic
randomness. The release of neurotransmitter by a neuron is
random [34]. The response of a neuron to repeated presenta-
tions of the same stimulus appears to be stochastic [35].
The response of a population of neurons to a stimulus also
