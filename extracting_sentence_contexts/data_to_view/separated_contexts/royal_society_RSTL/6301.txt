Z Taking first the Percentage of Fat in the fresh Carcass yielded by melting and exPres-
Fion, it is cen, that the amount around the kidneys increases very considerably as the
Animal fattens. In fact, practically, the judgment of the butcher on first disembowel-
ling an animal is perhaps more influenced by the fatness of the kidneys than by any
other single point. The figures show (Table IIL.), that, whilst the Carcass of the half-
fat Ox afforded 3-07 per cent. of fat, by melting and expression, from around the Kkid-
aeys, that of the fatter, but only moderately fat Ox, gave 5:44 per cent. of such fat. Of
the Sheep, the Carcass of the store animal gave only 1-69 per cent. of melted and ex-
presxed kidney fat ; that of the half-fat old one 3:60 per cent. ; and that of the moderately
fat one 8-38 per cent.
