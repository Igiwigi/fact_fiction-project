and trapping, notably by reduction in diffusion rate with increasing CE, the results of this study
show no obvious effect of CE on HE susceptibility. Although there is not an obvious explanation,
it is possible that, at an imposed potential of —1.20V, the lattice and dislocations are saturated
with H relatively quickly, thus negating any measurable effect of increased dislocation density on
hydrogen transport, and on observed HE susceptibility.

(iv) Theme 4: effect of tempering temperature

As was mentioned at the outset, hardness has a first-order effect on HE susceptibility. Higher
hardness is achieved by reducing the temperature during tempering. Therefore, it is normal
that a trend of lower NFS»,1.2v is observed with decreasing tempering temperature as shown
in figure 15. However, the data points show a poor fit to the binomial trend line. This poor
fit is explained by the fact that tempering temperature does not have a direct effect on HE
susceptibility. Rather, tempering temperature determines the final as-tempered microstructure,
which in turn has second-order effects on hydrogen damage and transport and trapping
mechanisms.

4. Discussion

(a) Threshold curve

Threshold results presented thus far were obtained under a single hydrogen charging condition
(ie. —1.20V). There is significant value to performing ISL testing while systematically varying
