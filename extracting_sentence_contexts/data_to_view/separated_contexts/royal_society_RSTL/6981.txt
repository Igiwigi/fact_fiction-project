commissure which unites the supraventricular masses of the hemispheres in the Beaver
and all other placentally developed Mammalia, and which exists in addition to the
hippocampal commissure, is wanting in the brain of the Wombat: and as the same
deficiency exists in the brain of the Great and Bush Kangaroos, the Vulpine Phalanger,
the Ursine, and Mauce's Dasyures, and the Virginian Opossum, it is most probably the
characteristic of the marsupial division of Mammalia.” The relatively large size of the
anterior commissure in the marsnpials is referred to in the paper as worthy of notice,
as also is the proportionally very large size of the hippocampi majores,

The description given in this important memoir was subsequently reproduced in the
Cyclopzdia of Anatomy and Physiology, art. Marsupialia, and it was shown that the
same peculiarity also existed in the Monotremata, and therefore was characteristic of the
whole implacental division.
