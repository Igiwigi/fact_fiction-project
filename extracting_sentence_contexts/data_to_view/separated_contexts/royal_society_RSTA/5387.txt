But, for quite other reasons, the dynamically determined stress might be entirely
srong. Electric and magnetic “force” and their energies are facts. But it is the
otal of the energies in concrete cases that should be regarded as the facts, rather
hen their distribution ; for example, that, as Sir W. THomson proved, the “mechanical
‘Balue” of a simple closed current C is }LC*, where L is the inductance of the circuit
oefficient of electromagnetic capacity), rather than that its distribution in space is
given by SHB per unit volume. Other distributions may give the same total amount
‘ef energy. For example, the energy of distortion of an elastic solid may be expressed
&n terms of the square of the rotation and the square of the expansion, if its boundary
De held at rest; but this does not correctly localise the energy.
