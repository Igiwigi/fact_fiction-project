Finally, we will discuss miss-
cues, or describe action policies that maximize predetermined ing steps towards intelligent systems that can engage in
task-level or social cost functions. The shortcomings of this human-compatible interaction and cooperation.

approach arise from the

— separation of social perception, reasoning, decision- . . . . .
making and action in order to come up with modular, 2. Socially enactive minds for interactive
specialized solutions for these (in fact, inseparable) sub- intelligent systems
problems. As a result, current systems excel, for instance,
in social signal processing or natural language conversa-
tion but get complex and clumsy when plugging these
heavy-weight modules together.

— neglect of the subjective mental perspectives of the inter-
acting agents that come to be mutually established and
extended through social interaction. While previous
work has tried to formalize the relevant internal states
of human users and interactive agents, their mental per-
spectives towards each other’s mental states along with
a suitable notion of sharedness of goals, beliefs or attitudes
still have not been accounted for sufficiently.
