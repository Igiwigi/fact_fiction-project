Let us use @ as independent variable in equations of motion (18-9). The fifth equation gives at once that w’ is of the second order. Noting that x,, /,; %,
are usually negligible; and taking into account the fact that usually, for normal con-
dition, x,,/kps Yolk are of zero order, while z,,/kp, Z,/ky are of order —1; then since v’
is small, while w’ is of the second order, we at once deduce that the first three equations

of (18-9) give

To the order of our first approximation, we are in (18-3) putting
(i) X=0,. (i) Y=0;, Gu) Z=—pSk, 2. (20-2)

Thus (i) we neglect the drag. (Ifthe air screws are in action and the thrust is small compared
to the weight, we also neglect the thrust, and get the same result—as happened in the
longitudinal problem.) Also

(ii) we neglect the effect of the side-slip on the air resistance; and

(iii) we assume “‘ constant incidence”? , neglecting the effect on the lift of changes in the w velocity
component. Finally, we assume that the machine adjusts itself in the Lanchester manner about each of
the three axes.
