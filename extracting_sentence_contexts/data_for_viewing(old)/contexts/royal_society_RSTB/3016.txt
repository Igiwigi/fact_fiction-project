suspended water columns able to transmit it. Thus, Ossorne ReyNoups gives the
breaking strain of a water column free from air as 72°5 lbs. per square inch, or nearly
5 atmospheres, and although Dixon and Joty{ have shown that the presence of
dissolved air does not lower the breaking strain, the moment even a small air-bubble
appears it will expand either until it fills the vessel, or until its pressure is some small
fraction of an atmosphere, and the tension transmitted beyond it will fall
correspondingly.

The maximum negative pressure observed in the trunk of a transpiring tree is
usually stated to be one atmosphere, and in transpiring branches to be less than half
an atmosphere.§ By this is simply meant however, that in the first case, the
pressure is zero and in the second half an atmosphere less than that of the
atmosphere. In fact no negative tension can exist in the vessels, so long as large
bubbles of air are present.

Section 23.—-The Influence of Surface-tension upon the Pressure of Air in
the Vessels,

A stationary bubble of air will have approximately the same pressure inside it,
whether spherical or cylindrical with hemispherical ends. If the bubble is
0:005 centim. diameter, the excess of pressure in it over the hydrostatic pressure

oT
outside will be : = = dynes or 59 centims. of water at 20° C. (gth of an
atmosphere).
