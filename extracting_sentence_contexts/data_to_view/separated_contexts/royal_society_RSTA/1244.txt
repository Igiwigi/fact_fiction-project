Proof. The main idea is that Theorem 5.3 provides the right estimate to generalize the proof of
BrzeZniak & Peszat’s [58, Theorem 1.2]. The proof will use some additional facts from stochastic
analysis which are all standard and can be found in [36,66]. Step 1. Let us first assume that g € L™®(2;L?(0,T; y(H, X))) is such that for every t €[0,T], we
have g; € D(A(t)) and tr A(t)g; belongs to 1°(0,T; y(H, X)) almost surely.
