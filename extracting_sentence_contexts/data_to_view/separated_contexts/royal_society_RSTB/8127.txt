The main long-term forecasts are produced by the
FAO (2006), revised by Alexandratos (2009). Accord-
ing to these forecasts, there is still scope for future
demand growth, although almost zero population
growth is expected at the global level. This is explained
by the fact that most projected population growth will
occur in countries with very low consumption levels,
mainly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite this expected
positive demand growth, growth rates are expected to
decrease in the future owing to lower population
growth and the attainment of medium-high levels of
per capita consumption in some emerging markets,
especially China, which has experienced very high
demand growth in the past. While declining growth
rates of food for human consumption are expected,
these could be compensated by the additional
demand arising from biofuels.
