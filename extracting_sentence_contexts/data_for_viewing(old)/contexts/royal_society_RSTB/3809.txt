sclerotic elements become embedded in the ordinary medullary rays near the leaf
trace. I have found a few similar cells in other species, but nothing to be compared
with the conditions in the Kauri.

The medullary ray cells are then characteristically thin-walled in the Araucarians,
and are comparable to those in the Cordaitean forms. ‘They are also unpitted in the
Araucarinese as in the latter. Often these cells have been wrongly spoken of as
having pits on the lateral walls where they come into contact with the tracheids,
some anatomists even going so far as to distinguish the pitting as of the bordered
type. Gornan has noted this especially in the case of Pennaniow (1900), when
discussing the latter’s statement that there are ray tracheids in Cordaites Clarkia.
He says that all Penuatnow’s ray cells are tracheids on account of their pitting.
With this as a basis and the fact that the ray tracheids have not been figured, he
goes so far as to question this unique example of their occurrence in the Cordaitean
forms. I have examined carefully the type set of sections and have found no
evidence to contradict GoTHAN’s conclusion.

The Cordaitean and Araucarian forms thus agree in the parenchymatous and
unpitted character of the ray cells. The cells of the former, too, are long in the
pith region, as I have observed in the type form, Dadoxylon Brandlingit. This, too,
must be characteristic for the Cordaitean forms, for Granp’ Eury (1877, p. 262)
speaks of the ray cells, in general, as being nearly as high as long. I take it,
however, that his statement must apply to young wood especially, for the numerous
specimens in the McGill University collection which I have examined do not show
this to be characteristic of the old wood.
