ethylene being 20-85 c.c. Equilibrium density values subsequent to rising tempera-
ture changes were first obtained. That they were equilibrium values is shown by the
fact that the density readings became constant in approximately twenty minutes
after thermal equilibrium was established in the bath, and that they remained
constant after a subsequent hour of observation. These results are plotted in
curve A. At approximately 5° C. above the critical temperature, no further density
change was observed with increasing temperature (critical temperature of ethylene
is 9-50° C.). After reaching a temperature 5° C. above the critical, the temperature
was lowered and the density was found to remain constant until the liquid phase
reappeared. The density then rapidly increased with decreasing temperature
(curve B). Even below the critical temperature with a visible meniscus present,
the values of the density obtained on curve B are not the same as those on curve A
at the same temperature. With decreasing temperature, however, the two curves
approach one another and coincide at approximately 1° C. below the critical
temperature. These results are in accord with the results of similar experiments on
