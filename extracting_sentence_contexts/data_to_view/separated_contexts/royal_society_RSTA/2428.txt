This requires large surfaces near the divertor and
an atomizer. A small test stand with such a set-up is installed at KIT. The foils can also build


pressure on the other side and thus contribute to pumping due to the fact that the recombined
molecules of hydrogen cannot penetrate them. The downside of this method is that hydrogen
which is outgassing from metals will contaminate the DT fuel and thus this has to be controlled. Also, the D and T isotopes have to be rebalanced and therefore a small part of the exhaust
stream has to go through isotope separation.
