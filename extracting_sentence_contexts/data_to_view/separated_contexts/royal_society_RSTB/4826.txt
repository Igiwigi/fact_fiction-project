The effect of the eight-times turning was thus com-
parable with that of the five-times turning of Table III. Since, moreover, the standard error of the difference between the percentages observed
in two samples of 120 each, with an expectation of 58-6 per cent. is 6-4 per cent., the
agreement between the two percentage gains is not only as close as can be expected,
but the small difference between their mean and the gain for five-times turning
(Table IIT.) may well be due to pure accident. On the whole, Tables IIT. and VI. may be said to establish the fact that when the amount
of egg turning is raised from twice to five-times in 24 hours there is a real improvement in
the hatching of the order of 10 per cent., and that for a further rise from five- to eight-
times the corresponding change in the hatching—if any—is negligibly small. One of the “ Factors in Incubation” studied by Prof. Kirkpatrick (loc. cit.) was
the effect of turning.
