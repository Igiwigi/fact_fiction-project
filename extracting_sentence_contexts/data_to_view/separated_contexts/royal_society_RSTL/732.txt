In-most of the former papers which I have had: the honour
to-lay before the Royal Society, I have for greater perspicuity
generally concluded with a recapitulation of the contents, but
in the present case, this appears to be superfluous, as the whole
may be concentrated into one simple fact, namely, that a sub-
stance very analogous to-tannin, which has hitherto been con-
sidered as one of the proximate principles of vegetables, may
at any time be produced, by exposing carbonaceous substances,

Since the preceding experiments were made, I have farther
proved the efficacy of this substance by actual practice, and
have converted skin into leather by means of materials which,
to professional men, must appear extraordinary, such as, deal
saw-dust, asphaltum, common turpentine, pit-coal, wax candle,
and a piece of the same sort of skin. Allowing, therefore, that the production of this substance
must for the present be principally regarded only as a curious
chemical fact not altogether unimportant, yet as the principle
on which it is founded appears to be developed, we may hope,
that a more economical process will be -discovered, s0- that
every tanner may be enabled to prepare his leather even from
the refuse of his present materials. The organized bodies and their products have only of late
years much attracted the attention of chemists, many of whom,
even at this time, (although the modes of chemical examina-
tion have been 80 much improved,) seem | disgusted' and
deterred by the Proteus-like changes which take place when-
ever these substances are subjected to experiment. But these variable and endless alterations of their properties
seem rather calculated to operate as incitements to investi-
gation ; for by the accumulation of facts resulting from the
changes produced in these bodies by disuniting and/ by re-
combining their elementary principles, not only will chemistry
as a'science become farther illumined and extended, but it
will, as it has hitherto done, render great and essential services
to the arts and manufactures.
