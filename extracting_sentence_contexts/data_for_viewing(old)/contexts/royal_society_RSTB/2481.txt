represent the citric-acid-soluble phosphoric acid obtained from the samples while yet
fresh, the numbers obtained for the 1865 and 1881 samples do not tell us what was the
citric-acid-soluble phosphoric acid in 1865 or in 1881, but only how much remains
soluble after the dry soils have been kept stored in the laboratory through all the
intervening years. Seeing that the soil is a highly complex mass, containing a
quantity of silicates and of more or less free basic oxides, with a relatively minute
quantity of salts, there is no knowing what chemical interchanges may have taken
place in the course of time. Certainly by no means the whole of the surplus phos-
phorie acid supplied to the soil remains in a citric-acid-soluble condition ; some of it
reverts into some less soluble form. How far such change follows rapidly on its
application, or how far it is the work of time, we cannot very well tell. The numbers
obtained for the earlier samples, therefore, must be regarded cautiously, in view of
the fact that they are not strictly comparable with the numbers for the 1893 samples,
which were obtained while the samples were yet fresh.

Plot 3 (Unmanured).

This plot has had no manure whatever since the beginning of the experiments in
1844. Its yield from 1852 to 1893 averaged 122 bushels of wheat and 103 cwts. of
straw per acre. From 1889 to 1894 the average was 13} bushels of wheat and
94 ewts. of straw.

The quantity of phosphoric acid removed in the crops during the fifty years,
estimated from the periodical analyses of the ashes of the crops, is as follows, viz. :â€”
