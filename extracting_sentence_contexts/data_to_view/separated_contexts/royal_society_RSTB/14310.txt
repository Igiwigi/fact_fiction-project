sensorimotor strength ratings were produced for American
English, but our items from the Banks & Connell category
production norms were for British English, we matched
each item to its equivalent American English term where
necessary to extract ratings. For example, we matched equiv-
alent spellings (e.g. item theatre > ratings for theater) and
dialectal terms (e.g. football — soccer; wrench > spanner). Plural items were also matched to singular equivalents (e.g.
oranges — orange), abbreviated items were matched to their
full version (e.g. sci-fi > science fiction) and quantifiers were
ignored (e.g. one-eighth > eighth). Polysemous items were
matched to their category-specific sense if that term was
available in the sensorimotor norms, (e.g. apple as a
member of tree — apple tree; sprouts as a green vegetable > Brus-
sels sprouts). All matched terms are listed in the data file [55].
