and with the mirror image of a P on the other end, but with the two upright strokes of the
two letters not parallel. The distinction may possibly be without a difference so far as the
biological world is concerned, but mathematically it should not be ignored.

If the organisms of a species are sufficiently alike, and the absence of left-right symmetry
sufficiently pronounced, it is possible to describe each individual as either right-handed or
left-handed without there being difficulty in classifying any particular specimen. In man,
for instance, one could take the X-axis in the forward direction, the Y-axis at right angles
to it in the direction towards the side on which the heart is felt, and the Z-axis upwards.
The specimen is classed as left-handed or right-handed according as the axes so chosen are
left-handed or right-handed. A new classification has of course to be defined for each species.

The fact that there exist organisms which do not have left-right symmetry does not in
itself cause any difficulty. It has already been explained how various kinds of symmetry can
be lost in the development of the embryo, due to the particular disturbances (or ‘noise’)
influencing the particular specimen not having that kind of symmetry, taken in conjunction

with appropriate kinds of instability. The difficulty lies in the fact that there are species in
which the proportions of left-handed and right-handed types are very unequal. It will be
as well to describe first an argument which appears to show that this should not happen.

The argument is very general, and might be applied to a very wide class of theories of
