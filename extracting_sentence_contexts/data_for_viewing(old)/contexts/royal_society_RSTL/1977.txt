S into protuberances, s0 as to render the general outline of the whole nebula, a
S regular ellipse, haying for its shorter axis the common axis of the two bright

form, under which it was imperfectly seen by Mzssttr. To this axis the com-
plete figure is symmetrical, and if we are disposed to regard it as a mass in
rotation, it is about this axis that we must suppose it to revolve. In that case
its real form must be that of an ohlate spheroid; and as it does not. follow that
the brightest portions must of necessity be the densest, this snpposition would
