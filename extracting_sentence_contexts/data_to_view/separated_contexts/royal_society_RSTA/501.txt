Most of these studies obtain different high frequency cut-offs for Alfvénic waves for
different features (spicules, filaments, prominences, thin flux tubes, etc.) using fixed values for the
ion-neutral collision frequency of semi-empirical models such as the VAL-C model [102,106,107]. This dissipation contributes to the thermal and dynamic energy budget. In fact, as mentioned
in the previous section, electrical currents perpendicular to the magnetic field can be dissipated
by ambipolar diffusion and convert magnetic energy into thermal energy [108-111]. Soler et al.
[112,113] deduced that kink waves are damped by diffusion parallel to the magnetic field and
Alfvén waves by perpendicular diffusion. For short wavelengths, kink waves are converted into
Alfvén waves owing to the collisions between ions and neutrals.
