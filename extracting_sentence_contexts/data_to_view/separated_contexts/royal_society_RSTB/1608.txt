But before dealing with this aspect of the problem it
will be advisable to state what is actually and experimentally known asto the bydro-
static function of the air-bladder in Fishes in general. * See p. 268,


ON THR ANATOMY OF FISHES. 277

One of the earliest theories of the hydrostatic fiction of the aimbladdew with which
“we are uequainted is that propounded by Borznrr in 1685, According to his theory
Vhe fuvetion of the ni-bladder, in its mean condition, is to render the specific pvayvity
of te Fish eqaal to thaf of the water in which if lives, and also nid the Fish in its
jooyements of ascent and descent in the water, sach movements being due either to
4n increase in the specific gravity of the aniotal as the result of museular compression
of the air-bladder, or to the diminished specific gravity which would resnlt from
muscular relaxation and the consequent expansion of the eontained gases.* From
the time of Borects until the publication of the results of Mongac's experimental

Stosearches in 1976, the function of the air-bladder proved a frnitti source of disenssion
pimong zoologists and comparative pliysiologists, among whom the names of DEeLa-
“eRanHE, Cuvir, Staxnrus, Goverer, Owey, Bror, Moxynoyen, and Jowannes
Minn may be mentioned. Most of these writers, however, adopted the theory of
ABonet with gsearcely any modification, and with a like absence of any attempt at
Spxperimental proof.
