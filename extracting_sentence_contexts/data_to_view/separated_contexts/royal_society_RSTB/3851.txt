The Survey Map shows two such seams
extending from Glazeley southward to Billingsley, and two others, more to the West,
from Billingsley to Kinlet Knowl, and again further South at Baveney Wood. It
must not, however, be imagined that these are the outcrops of the same seams. As a matter of fact these coals do not all belong to the same series of measures. Those furthest to the North belong to the Sulphur Coal Measures, while the rest are
Sweet Coals.* According to JonEs,+ the Sweet Coals crop out only in the Western
portion of the field.
