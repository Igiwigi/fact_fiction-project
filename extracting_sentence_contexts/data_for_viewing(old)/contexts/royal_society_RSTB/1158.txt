It is seen that with the minimal stimulus an effect is practically only evoked by
excitation of the posterior column of the satne side as the root ; with a stimulus of
greater intensity an effect is also obtained with stimulation of the posterior column of
the opposite side, this being one-fourth the amount of that evoked by stimulation of
the column of the same side, As regards the lateral columns, only once was any effect
in the root obtained, and that was with stimulation of the column of the same side.

If it be remembered that the minimal effect is exaggerated in the case of the
posterior columns by the fact that their stimulation coincided with the fresh condition
of the root, it will be seen that as far as the relations between the effects due to

excitation of the two posterior columns are concerned, the above experiments give
results which are fundanientally the same as those obtained in the mixed nerve. On
the other hand, the lateral column effect is almost entirely wanting in these
experiments. The alterations in the excitability of the posterior root itself may be
to some extent responsible for this, and in any case should, if possible, be excluded.
In order to carry out this exclusion, experiments were performed in which, whilst
investigating the effect in the mixed sciatic nerve, the (motor) efferent paths were
