For example,
the case of Miyadera—Voigt perturbation can be seen as the feedback of a system (A, Ix, C), where
C is an admissible observation operator for A, while the Desch-Schappacher perturbation as a
result of the feedback of a system (A,B,C), where C is a bounded operator from X to U and
B:U-— X_, is an admissible control operator for A. The feedback theory of general regular linear
systems coincides with the problem of unbounded perturbations of the generator domain. In fact,
to visualize this connection, define an operator Ay C Am with domain D(A) = {x € D(Am) : Gx =
Mx}, where G,M:Z Cc X > X, Am: Z— X is an operator such that A= Am with domain D(A) =
ker G is the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup T on X. We see that M is a perturbation
of the domain of A. As we will see in the next section, the generation property of Ajy is related to
the existence of a regular system with admissible feedback.
