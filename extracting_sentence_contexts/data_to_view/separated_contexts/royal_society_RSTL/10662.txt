of the total magnetism. $117, The actual amount of magnetic change, and even its sign, depends on the
* degree of magnetisation. This follows from the known fact that there is a critical
' yalue of the magnetising force, or (more probably) of the magnetisation, below which
heating inereases susceptibility, and above which. heating reduces susceptibility. (Bavn, Wied.
