320 SIR F. W. DYSON, PROF, A. 8. EDDINGTON AND MR. C. DAVIDSON ON A

The sign of the results shows that the scale of the photographs is larger at Principe
than at Oxford; in fact the focus must have been set about 1-2 mm. further out
(apart from any change of length compensated by expansion of the photographic plates).
As the error in focussing was probably not more than 0-5 mm., the greater part of this
shift must be due to the focal length of the lens combination increasing with temperature
more rapidly than the linear expansion of the glass.

If the only difference were a change of focal length, we should have a’ =e’. There
is a fairly strong indication that e’ is greater than a’. This is no doubt due to a change
in the definition caused by the ccelostat mirror or by a shift of the object-glass lenses
on the journey ; and, as it will presumably affect the eclipse plates in the same way,
it is best to adopt the values of a’ and e’ as determined, rather than to take a mean.
In so doing we shall at any rate not exaggerate the displacement, which depends mainly
on the y-measures and is reduced by adopting too large a value of e’.*
