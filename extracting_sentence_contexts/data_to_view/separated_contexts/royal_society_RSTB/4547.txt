The presence of cceca to the mid-gut appears to be a character
inherited from the Colotasia (Borpas, 1898, p. 191) group of the Orthoptera, and
these structures have not so far been detected in any other Termite. The crop and
gizzard are extremely similar, both in form and histology, though the gizzard is less
strongly developed than in the Blattide. The Malpighian tubes alone offer any
fundamental point of difference, and the fact that they are few in number in Termites,
and numerous in the Orthoptera, is perhaps due to the probability that the former
are more primitive in this respect than the latter. In Archotermopsis and, according
to Honmeren, in Hodotermes, Porotermes (Glyptotermes), and Calotermes eight
Malpighian tubes are present. It is noteworthy that these four genera belong to the
generalised family of the Protermitide.
