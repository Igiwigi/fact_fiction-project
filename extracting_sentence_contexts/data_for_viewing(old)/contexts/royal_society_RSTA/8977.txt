We have seen that 19989 belongs to this normal set with a mantissa = 80A, and
that 20581 satisfies the condition necessary for a D, line with this. The difference of
their mantissa (see below) is 2940. If they are of the D,,, D,, types, as is indicated
by the fact that the first belongs to a doublet and the second stands by itself, a triplet
satellite set should be expected whose first line D,, is separated from the D,, by about
three-fifths that of D,, from D,,. Its mantissa should therefore be about 183 = A, less.
This would mean a line about 19623 forming the first line of a triplet. No line is
observed here. There are, however, lines at (1) 19602°66 and (3) 19632°44 of which
19602 passes the suitability test for a normal D line, and the other does not. The
mantissa of 19602 is 79A,—4, z.e., 198 behind that of 19989 and rather too large. On
the other hand the problematic 19623 may be too weak, in which case the corresponding
D,, D, lines which should be stronger might be observable. The D, line should be
about 21400. We do find this, in fact, with triplets of a kind. The whole set of these
lines can then be arranged as follows :—
