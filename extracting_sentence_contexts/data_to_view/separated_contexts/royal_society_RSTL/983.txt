Added to this the lower portion, on a more
minute inspection, has an appearance somewhat similar.to the
inner membrane of the human stomach : and the surface of
the plice is in many respects different. From the facts and observations which have been stated, it
appears that in many animals of the class Mammalia, the food
undergoes different changes preparatory to its being con--
verted into chyle, and this last process is effected by a some-
what similar secretion, since the part of the stomach which
produces it, has in all of them an evident similarity of
structure. The above facts appear to throw some light on the diges-
tion of the different kinds of food, and open a wide field of
enquiry into one of the most interesting parts of the animal
ceconomy, which has been hitherto too much neglected. In
the present very limited state of our knowledge there are

many circumstances which cannot be accounted for: these
however, will be explained when a further progress has been
made in this investigation. It is obvious, that as the stomachs of carnivorous animals
are the most simple, animal substances, on which they feed,
require a $horter process to convert them into chyle than
vegetables; but why the whale tribe, which live on fish,
Should have a more complex $tomach, it is not easy to ex-
plain: since fish are very readily converted into chyle, in the
stomachs of animals of their own class, as well as in the
human stomach, and there is therefore reason to believe that
they require as little preparation for that process, if not less
than animal substances.
