Now consider an alternative Hamiltonian, produced by rotating
n by an angle a about the z-axis; the new Hamiltonian would be given by n'-o. The
corresponding unitary operator is given by n'-o =e~#:/2n. gel"?:/?, Noting that Ce®C-l=
CBC (this identity is independent of whether B and C commute and can be easily verified
with a Taylor expansion), we have |w/(t)) =e7!!""*|A) =e tet Pmae1 4) So, Prob’ 4(t) =
[W(BIA) I? = | (Alei#0=/2e-tttr9 eta: /2|A) |? = |(Ale~i#/2ei @it/2|A) |? The last equality employs
the fact that oz|A)=|A)=(}), and then the three operators e!“/?, e~i"@ and e~!*/? commute. So we conclude Prob’ 4(t) = |(Ale~#"* |A)|?, exactly as before. In the Bloch representation, it
corresponds to the same behaviour of projection of the evolved state vector on the z-axis (cf.
figure 2c with e and figure 2d with f).
