A very obvious structure in figure 2a is the knob or boss that occurs just above Darwin’s
muscle (figure 26). At first sight, having discovered Darwin’s muscle in sections, it appeared
as though these bosses, by coming together with the middle line, formed the fulcrum about
which the terga rocked. It soon became evident, however, that this was not so. For one
thing, no section ever showed the bosses in contact. They were always separated by a zone
occupied by connective tissue as in figure 2b, or by a peculiar ovoid, apparently closed
vesicle, as in figure 3. When the latter occurs, it has a definite shape, but equally definitely
it may be absent. There is a similar structure between the lower tips of the scuta where they
are connected to the base of the rostrum, and these plates also carry small bossés in this
region (figures 3 and 4).*

The constitution of the tergal bosses is as puzzling as their function. They are always
irregular in outline, a fact noticed by Darwin (1851, p. 368), who describes them as
roughened. The difficult point to explain arises from the method of growth of the capitular
plates of Lithotrya. These grow by adding on new zones at their bases, and polarized light
shows very clearly the manner by which new calcareous matter has been laid down
(figure 26). It will be seen that a zone of deposition passes right through a tergal boss.
It can only be concluded from this that the boss is resorbed at each moult and then reformed
lower down the plate. This fact would make it impossible for the bosses to act as a hinge
during opening and closing of the valves. It would, however, account for the irregular
outline of the boss.
