(6.20)

Here, we are considering the contribution to m4 from each particular value of aq(X° +aX + B).
The factor of q outside the sums is to account for the fact that m4 is a sum over Ha rather
than Fg a- We run over all square-free M+aX+ pe F,[X], and also their twists X38 4 a2aX +036
(where, as before, a is any fixed non-square in F,), that give rise to that particular value of +aq.
For any such pair of curves in Ha, we count how many y? = X* + Ax* + Bx + C are associated to
them using (6.15) and (6.17). Because j is odd, a, = —(—ag)/, thus resulting in (6.20) when the two
are combined. The impact of running over curves and their twists (with a7 40) is to count each
twice, hence the extra factors of 2 in front of both sides of (6.20).

Now, the inner sum equals —a,(X? +aX + B), as one can check by substituting t= —A/6,
which runs over F, as A does, and —C/4 =a + A?/48 =a + 3f?/4 into the summand. Thus, the
inner sum in (6.20) equals

x? +aX
