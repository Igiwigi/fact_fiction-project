If ge Ji
then clearly g(x”) =x". This shows that there are an infinite number of distinct isometries in Gx
that also fix x” # x. We claim that there are in fact an infinite sequence of proper rotations in Gx
with this property. If that were not true, then there would necessarily be an infinite number of
improper rotations g; € Gx, gj = (Q;|(I — Q;)x), that satisfy Q;e =e, e=x” — x. But then, 8% are
an infinite number of distinct proper rotations that fix both x and x”.
