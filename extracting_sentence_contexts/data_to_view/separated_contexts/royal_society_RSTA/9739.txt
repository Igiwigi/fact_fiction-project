A tentative explanation of these facts may be based on either of two hypotheses :


ON THE OSMOTIC PRESSURES OF CALCIUM FERROCYANIDE SOLUTIONS. 333

(1) that the salts in solution are associated* into double molecules, and these are
ionised, or (2) that the salts are ionised single molecules, and the ions are themselves
aggregated into larger complexes.

Ordinates are the equivalent conductivities.
|Abscissee are the gram. equivalents per litre of solution. Curve (1) refers to the calcium solutions.

Diagram 1. The first hypothesis is the more simple (it admits of a suitable chemical formula
being postulated), and if by its aid we can explain the facts, it will not be necessary
to consider the second. Assuming, then, that the molecules are double, we shall get the following tables, in

divalent metals as evidenced by the lowering of the vapour pressures of the solutions.
