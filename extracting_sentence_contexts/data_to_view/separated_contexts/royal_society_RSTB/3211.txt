The heights are given
as observed by WALTER, Cape Otway; Ropryson, Mount Baw Baw; Howirrr,
Gippsland; and D, Boyze, in the Dandenong Ranges, and are 415, 471, 410, and
420 feet respectively. None of the erect trees appear to have been properly
measured, but BoyLe’s measurement was stated to be made on a fallen tree from
which the top was wanting. The accuracy of the last-named observer is sufficiently
indicated by the fact that the height of a tree was first given by him* as 525 feet,
subsequently reduced to 466 feet, and proved on accurate measurement by Mr. FULLER,
in May, 1889, to be 220 feet high and 48 feet girth 6 feet above ground. Various
statements as to the existence of specially tall trees of over 350 feet in height have
all proved on proper measurement to be considerably exaggerated when the supposed
giant was found. Many fallen giants with heights given as from 450 to 500 feet
evaporated into thin air on the approach of accurate instruments and unbiassed
observers.
