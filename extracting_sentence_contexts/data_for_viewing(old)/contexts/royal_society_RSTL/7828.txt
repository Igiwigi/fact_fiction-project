binode By, is a thrice-taken CC-axis; (Ug=3C) each of the rays is regarded as a CC-axis ;
(U,=B+2C) the double ray is regarded as a twice-taken CB-axis, and the single ray as
a CC-axis; (U,=2B+C) the ray is regarded as a BB-axis + a twice-taken CB-axis.

25, It has been mentioned that the intersection of the surface with the Tlessian con-
8ists of the spinode curye, together with certain right lines; these lines are in fact the
axes—viz. the examination of the several cases shows that in the complete intersection
each CC-axis presents itself twice, each CB-axis 3 times, and each BB-axis 4 times. We
thus see that a CC-axis, or rather the torsal plane along such axis, is the pinch-plane or
8ingularity j/=1; the CB-axis, or rather the torsal plane along such axis, the close-
plane or singularity /=1; and the BB-axis, or oscular plane along such axis, the bitrope
or singularity B'=1 ; for a cubic surface with singular lines the expression of o' being
in fact o'=12—2//—3;/—4B', There are, howeyer, some cases requiring explanation ;
thus for the case VIIT=12—B,, where the edge is by what precedes a CB-axis, the
complete intersection is made up of the edge 4 times and of an octic curve; the con-
8ideration of the reciprocal surface shows, however, that the edge taken once is really part
of the spinode curye (viz. that this curye is made up of the edge taken once and of the
octic curye, its order being thus o'=9); and the interpretation then of course is that the
intersection is made up of the edge taken 3 times (as for a CB-axis it should be) and of
the spinode curvye.

26. I remark in further explanation, that in the several sections, in showing how the
complete intersection of the cubic surface with the Hessian is made up, I have not
referred to the axes in the above precise significations; thus XIV=12—B,—C,, the
binode B, is C+B, and the edge is thus a CB-axis, while the axis B,C, is a CB-axis
