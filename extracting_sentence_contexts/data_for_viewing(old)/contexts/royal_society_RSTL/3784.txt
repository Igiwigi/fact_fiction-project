thus, by division and subdivision, gradually acquires considerable breadth (fig. 69),
or there may be thus formed several separated spirals (figs. 73, 113 « «).

57. It will be seen, from the account above given of the formation of the muscular
fasciculus, that the young fasciculi have the largest and fewest spirals. In the very
young Tadpole, I found a great many fasciculi of this kind: while in the older
Tadpole, such fasciculi were less numerous. 'The fasciculi here presented, generally,
an increased number of spirals, with a diminution in their size.

58. I cannot doubt that the larger spirals perform contraction, as well as the
smaller. It is probable that the difference between the contractile force of muscles
in childhood and in adult age, is connected with the above-mentioned difference in
the number of the spirals. Nor is this supposition inconsistent with the fact, that
muscle by constant exercise increases in its bulk.

59. My observations on the form of the ultimate threads in voluntary muscle,
firs: made on the larva of a Batrachian Reptile, have been confirmed by an examina-
tion of this structure in each class of vertebrated animals, including the scaled Am-
phibia, and Cartilaginous as well as Osseous Fishes. Such of the Invertebrata, also,
as happened to be easily obtainable, were examined, and afforded ample confirmation
of those obseryations. They included animals in the Crustacea (Crab), Mollusca
(Limpet, Clam, Cockle, Mussel, Garden Snail, Periwinkle, Whelk), Annelida (Earth-
worm), and Insecta (a kind of Caterpillar).
