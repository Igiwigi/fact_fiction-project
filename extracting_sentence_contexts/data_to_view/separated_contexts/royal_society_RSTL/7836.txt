In other words, the whole number of sections of zero

* shearing, which we have shown to be also sections of water-borne division, must be

- odd in 8hips having excesses of weight at the bow and stern.

© Before concluding these remarks on shearing-forces, it may be well to compare the

- condition of the © Minotaur,” © Bellerophon,” and *© Audacious* when fully laden and

* floating in still water, as they represent different classes of ironclads. At the foremost

- balanced section (R' in Plate XVII. fig. 8) of the * Minotaur” the shearing-force is no
less than 420 tons; at the corresponding station (R' in Plate XVII. fig. 9) in the

S Bellerophon' it is only 45 tons, and at that in the * Audacious' (R', in Plate XVII.

. 10) it is 120 tons. The great difference between the © Minotaur” and the other two

= is partly due to the fact that she is completely protected with armour, while they

ve armoured central batteries and water-line belts; and partly to the very fine entrance
a4 V-formed sections which her designers considered desirable. It has already been

Sxplained that the pronounced U-form of transverse sections, and the fall-back contour
Bf 8tem in the © Bellerophon' have much to do with her small excess of weight at the

ow; and it may here be added that in the * Audacious' the excess of weight over
© "iierg though somewhat greater than in the © Bellerophon,' is still very moderate. A\t the aftermost balanced sections the shearing-forces are for the * Minotaur” about

50 tons, for the © Bellerophon' 210 tons, and for the © Audacious' 202 tons.
