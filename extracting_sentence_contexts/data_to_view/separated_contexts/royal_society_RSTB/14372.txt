Therefore, using temporal or spatial data of a given eco-
system, we should be able to detect whether the system is
losing resilience. The phenomenon of critical slowing down seems to
be universal and occurs when any dynamical system
approaches a transition. In fact, mathematically, the early-

Altogether, these studies suggest that incorporating the
diversity of interactions in ecological theory is a worthwhile
effort [57]. There is, however, currently no work that we
know of about alternative stable states and their implica-
tions for the responses of multi-layer ecological systems to
environmental changes.
