Their utility is probably obvious; but, in the first place, the
data required for their construction must almost invariably be obtained daily
throughout the season, since the day is the real time-unit in which a plant
measures its experiences. In the second place, they necessitate the employment
of labour, even though this be only semi-skilled. Against these disadvantages may
be set the fact that they abolish the probable error of plot experiments, thereby
making it possible to achieve good results with controlled areas whose dimensions
would be dangerously small if the yield were not thus analysed.- It is probable that
the solution lies in compromise, by first establishing a set of standard data, as
complete as possible, for any given crop and district, with which any subsequent
observations of salient features could be compared. The establishment of such a set
for the Giza Cotton Experiment Station was one of the author's chief aims, more
especially because the circumstances made it possible to obtain such data as a mere
side issue of the regular work. The desired extension of the observations to minor
outlying stations in other parts of Egypt would have provided not only a system of
precise Crop Reporting, on the lines of a weather report, but also a system of Crop
Forecasts.
