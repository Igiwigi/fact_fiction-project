The results
of the experiment were perfectly clear and decisive.

(a.d.) In an experiment which was made in the same manner with microcosmic
salt (NaO, NH, O, HO, P, O;), the sodinm travelled to the platinode, but the whole

of the ammonium remained in the zincode cell. Here a polybasic acid was used, and
yet results similar to those with a monobasic acid obtained. We have till further
evidence that the nature of the acid does not appear to be connected with this tra-
velling of the base, from the fact, that when the double tartrate of soda and ammonia

cell, the sodium was found to have travelled, but ammonium had refused to do 80,
as in the other cases already mentioned. It was thus ascertained, contrary to the anticipations which we had formed upon
its extreme s0lubility, that ammonium is included in that class of basie compounds
which refuse to travel in the voltaic circuit.

(a.e.) To show that a relation exists between the power of transference in the
circuit, and the affinity of the oxides of the metals, for water, the results of three
experiments may be taken with salts of potassa, baryta and magnesia.
