Monthly Means. On taking the arithmetical means, the results indicated by the curves were powerfully
Yutirmed, viz. that on the mountain, the maxima of temperature and dryness are earlier
San below; summer, in fact, at a great height, is there nearly coincident with the
Blstice. Thus while at the sea-level the temperature went on increasing throughont
Bly, August, and September, it was sensibly decreasing at Guajara in July and Angust ;
= at Alta Vista, in August and September, it was very rapidly falling. On going
Wow the sea-level, or to the sea-water itself, the law was carried on further still., the
