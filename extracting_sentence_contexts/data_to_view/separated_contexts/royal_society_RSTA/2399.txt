nodes 2, 4, 5 or 7; yet, the red cluster still synchronizes, as shown in figure 11c. These experiments
confirm the stability of such so-called equitable partition cluster synchronization [35]. As mentioned in ยง7, a chimera state is a dynamical state of a network in which the nodes split
up into a coherent set and an incoherent set despite the fact that they are all identical and coupled
identically [38,39]. The chimeras in ยง7 were observed in a network with circularly symmetric
coupling and many nodes. Using the system shown in figure 10, we were able to observe a
chimera state in a 5 node globally coupled network [34].
