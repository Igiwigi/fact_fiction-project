did at the edge of the bright phase : but had this faint streak,
like the more vivid light, been an immediate emanation from
the sun, the gradual diminution would have been throughout
progressive in a continued proportion ; and the light in the
dark part, immediately contiguous to the points of the cusps,
must have had nearly the same degree of brightness as the points
themselves, which was by no means the case.

Every circumstance, therefore, seems to evince that this
phznomenon is occasioned by a light reflected by the atmo-
sphere of Venus into the dark hemisphere of the planet, being
in some measure the light of the atmosphere itself, when illu-
minated by the rays of the sun, or, in fact, a real twilight.
But this will appear still more manifest when

4. We compare, according to the abovementioned observa-
tions, the alternate relative appearances of the cusps of Venus
reciprocally with each other. On the gth and 12th of March,
1790, when the southern cusp extended, not in the true sphe-
rical curve of the limb of the planet, but in a somewhat
hooked direction, into the dark hemisphere, the pale bluish
ash-coloured streak appeared only at the point of the northern
cusp, from whence it proceeded, in a true spherical curve, along
the dark limb of the planet. On the 10th of March, on the
other hand, when the southern cusp did not penetrate so far
