flight, aeroecology, wind, soaring, Air is arguably the most dynamic medium: it is turbulent, it can move at high
energy expenditure, movement ecology speeds (winds > 10m s-! are common at migration altitudes), and the strength

and variability of air currents vary from sub-second to seasonal scales, as well

1.6 times those of typical wind speeds [4,5]. This is equivalent to a Boeing 747
having to operate in winds of some 780 kmh‘'. In fact, even though wind
speeds are a much lower proportion of the flight speeds of commercial aircraft
(the ratio of flight speed to flow speed is in the order of 9.7: 1), wind speed is

still a key determinant of fuel consumption, journey time and flight route.

The fact that air is almost never still provides animals with potential opportu-
nities as well as challenges. Organisms from aphids to eagles time their flights in
order to exploit particular flow vectors [6,7], enabling them to travel with very low
energetic costs [8]. Movement timing is one of the simplest responses to airflows
in the behavioural repertoire, although it is an interesting one, as periods of inac-
tivity, as well as avoidance of particular airspace, may provide insight into the
environmental factors that represent limits to flight performance. Animals also
