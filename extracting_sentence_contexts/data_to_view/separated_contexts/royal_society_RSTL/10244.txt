59, 60, 63, 64). This fact
strongly indicates that there is some resistance to be overcome in the vitellus, for there
can be little doubt that the half-formed spheres contain fully developed nuelei. There are a number of other facts which point in the same direction. The first
formed cleavage furrows penetrate very slowly towards the centre of the ovum and,
in 80me cases at leasb, do nob reach the centre during the first stage of activity. The
segmentation is ab firs, therefore, of the type which Barrour has termed centrole-
cithal, the egg consisting of a peripheral layer of partially-formed cells and a solid
central yolk-mass.
