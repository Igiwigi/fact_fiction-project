If this were not a general rule,

because the female’s actions are such that they are preadapted to situations which are

likely to occur; for instance, the female searches for hosts which she may never have
encountered as an adult. Salt (1937) states that the fact that Trichogramma will reject true but unparasitized
hosts provided they are contaminated with the smell of a female, indicates that this
parasite selects its hosts by criteria which are not necessarily criteria of suitability. Now it will be generally conceded that the seeking out of hosts by parasites is done with
the object of either depositing an egg, or possibly feeding on the host contents; unless
considered in relation to these ends, the activity is meaningless to the observer. As
apparently Trichogramma does not feed on its hosts, one may justifiably claim that
unparasitized hosts which are examined, will, in the natural course of events, be
parasitized by the examining female.
