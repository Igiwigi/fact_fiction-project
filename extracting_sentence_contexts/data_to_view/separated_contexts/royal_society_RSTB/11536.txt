Plants such as
the Venus flytrap stop responding to stimulation of their trig-
ger hairs (normally excited by prey insects) when exposed to
ether [78], a volatile anaesthetic also working in man.” The
natural counterpart of anaesthesia—sleep—is equally ubiqui-
tous in the animal and plant kingdoms. Animals that do not
sleep have yet to be found [79], and many plants show clearly
different metabolic activity patterns (and appearances)
during day and night. We experience the difference between
awake and asleep as one of the most fundamental transitions

of consciousness, and the fact that conscious sensations are
lost during sleep is possibly the number one reason why
we believe there is consciousness. If this transition between
awake and asleep is present in all living beings, does that
imply that to these other beings the transition ‘feels’ equally
dramatic? And does it then follow that these beings should,
therefore, be granted consciousness—when awake?
