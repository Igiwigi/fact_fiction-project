- The animal there-
fore has not room to. turn itself; and its attachment by a
short byssus imposes an additional restraint upon it : indeed,
an examination of its muscles is sufficient to show that they
cannot effect a rotatory motion. The only: boring motion
which can be supposed to be given to the shell is that effected
by the action of the muscles of the foot ; that, in fact, by
which a Bivalvye buries itself in the sand ; but this, although
s0 well adapted for travelling over a smooth surface, or for
burrowing into a substance penetrable by the foot, would be
ineffectual here, because the animal being already in contact
with the rock, the foot cannot be projected to form a fixed
point beyond the $hell. Even were it otherwise, the texture
of the hell is 80 soft, that it could make no impression upon
the stone without being itself acted on ; and the effect of this
would be permanent, because superficial injuries of the shell
are never repaired. | But nothing} of this kind'is met with.
