The labour of computation involved is very large,
and in the present instance has been executed partly by the aid of a grant from the
Government Grant Committee of the Royal Society, and partly by assistance put at
my disposal by the Astronomer Royal and Dr. Scxusrer. While the data thus
obtained will, I trust, throw much new light on the theory both of the lunar and
solar diurnal magnetic variations, the investigation has been undertaken not with
any thought of finality in itself, but rather as an incentive to the provision of data
for a more accurate and detailed discussion by subsequent workers. The reduction of
the observations to the required form is, in fact, almost too great a labour for a
single person to undertake if it is to be done on an adequate scale and in a reasonable
time. It is in the hope, therefore, that a number of directors of magnetic observa-
tories may be induced to carry out the reductions for their own stations that I have,
in this paper, indicated what seems to me to be the simplest and most suitable method
of computation for the purpose, and also some of the lines along which the discussion
of the results from a single observatory should proceed. In a later paper some
further points will be dealt with, in addition to the final discussion of the collected
results from several observatories ; for a general review of the subject, reference may
be made to my recent discussion of the previously existing data for Batavia, Bombay,
(517.)
