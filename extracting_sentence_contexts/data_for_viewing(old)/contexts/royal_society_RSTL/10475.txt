a resistance box N. The other branches of the balance were (in one arrangement)
Â© composed of a coil of 10 units in multiple arc with which was placed a high resistance
box K, and three coils combined in series whose values were about 24, 1, 1 units, making
| together 26. All these coils were of the standard pattern, and their values had been
_already carefully determined. From the cup L the current passed back to the key B.
* The high resistance box K gives a fine adjustment by which the ratio of resistances
Lan be brought to the required value. The smallest resistance actually used here was
Yo00 units. While the electromagnetic balance was under obseryation a horse-shoe
ece of stout copper rod P, connected with the key as shown in the figure, was inserted
V the cups F, H. By this means these cups are brought accurately to the 8ame
Sotential, and nearly all the current is diverted from the standard resistance coils.
& The determination of the electromagnetic balance is rendered more troublesome by
be fact that the firs} motion of the magnet on the reversal of the current is influenced
fy induction, and cannot be used as a test. No attempt was made actually to com-
-Hlete the adjustment, but by preliminary trials resistances from N differing by about
2- unit were found, such that the effects observed were reversed in passing from one
the other. From the magnitude of these effects the required resulb is obtained by
Siterpolation. At the beginning and end of a series the 20 ratios of resistances were
Setermined by use of K, the horse-shoe P being of course withdrawn ; and the mean
@& the initial and final values (which usually differed extremely little) was employed
A the reduction.
EZ As an example, we may take some observations on Sept. 5, 1883, with the coil of
Hie dynamometer marked B. The difference of readings on reversal of the batter y in
Egiven manner was taken alternately with certain resistances from N, which we may
