of local predominance of a change taking place throughout the whole ventricle, we
think that the late monophasic variation is in reality due to local activity at and near
one of the two leading-off electrodes ; this, indeed, is often demonstrable at this period
by local excitation, which then causes contraction restricted to definite spots.

(b.) Excited contraction.—As regards the excitatory variation, our results with
the electrometer were entirely similar to those which we have already described with
the galvanometer. The accompanying Table summarises our electrometer observations.

§ VIII. Conclusion.

It would be superfluous to repeat, in summary, the facts relating to the mode of
decline of the excised Mammalian heart which are described in the second, third, and
fourth paragraphs of our paper. The extraordinary sluggishness of action, of which
these showed us that the Mammalian heart is capable under the conditions of our
experiments, tempted us to analyse as far as possible the mode and mechanism of
cardiac contraction in Mammalia,

In this direction the chief result, which we regard as established, is that on the
Mammalian heart, under conditions similar to those in which the Frog’s heart has been
examined in this respect, the passage of an excitatory wave is demonstrable as a
diphasic variation with the galvanometer and the electrometer, and that the passage
of a corresponding wave of contraction is demonstrable by mechanical methods.
