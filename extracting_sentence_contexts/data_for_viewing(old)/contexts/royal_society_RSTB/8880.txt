spacer block [28]. Within a shorter range, a 10 bp periodicity cor-
responding to the size of a DNA helix turn was also detected,
reflecting preferential cleavage of the DNA backbone that
faces away from nucleosome protection. Importantly, patterns
of sequence depth variation at known nucleosome arrays
showed. strong correlations with nucleosome occupancy. It
therefore seemed that in addition to the DNA sequence, the
compaction state of the chromatin could survive in fossils, and
that variation in read depth, corrected for base compositional
bias, could be used as a footprint of nucleosome protection to
reconstruct genome-wide nucleosome maps. Regional methy-
lation levels could also be tracked in the Saqqaq genome
sequence owing to the fact that it had been obtained by amplify-
ing DNA libraries using a polymerase that amplifies cytosines
deaminated due to post-mortem damage only when methy-
lated [29-31]. Focusing on read starts, where deamination
rates are highest, estimated methylation levels were found
to recapitulate known genomic patterns at different classes of
CpG promoters, splice sites and CTCF transcriptional repressor
sites. Strikingly, the Saqqaq methylome also appeared closer to
that of modern hair than to other somatic tissues. As nucleo-
some occupancy and cytosine methylation influence gene


expression, those could be used to predict gene expression levels populations from the region changed within the last 17 kyr. | 3 |
