Results from study of L. Selago. L.

e chief facts regarding the development of the sporangium in L. Selago may be

sarised as follows :â€”

The sporangium originates at the base of the sporophyll, as a transversely

ded cushion, consisting of many cells, arranged without strict regularity. | archesporium consists of one row of hypodermal cells, six or more in

er, which give rise to the whole of the sporogenous mass. Be tapetum is derived partly from the primitive wall of the sporangium (from
ermost of the three layers resulting from its division), partly from the cells

hdie directly below the archesporium.

'Bhe pad of tissue below the archesporium grows into a convex mass, which

so as to give a curved form to the sporogenous tissue; this is however less

@l than in some other species.
