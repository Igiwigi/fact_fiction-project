the optic tecta laterally. The very large auditory tubercles extend forward and
their rostral ends surround the caudal part of the cerebellum. The ventral surface
shows the lobi inferiores and the conspicuous transverse commissure just caudal to
the optic chiasm. The lateral view shows the auditory region especially well.

The epiphysis and also the paraphysis are identifiable in all three of the fish. The
epiphysis in Saurida and Bathypterois extends far rostrally above the fore-brain. The
paraphysis in Bathypterois, fig. 12, is especially large, very glandular, and also very
vascular. In this figure the epiphysis is directly above the paraphysis.

Although DammMerMAN (1910) has a paper entitled ‘‘ Der Saccus vasculosus der
Fische ein Tiefeorgan,” nothing was observed in these deep sea fish to substantiate
such a viewpoint. In fact, the saccus in these fish is rather small.

A description of the nucleus preopticus is not included in this paper, as nothing
new was observed. CHARLTON (1932) has written an excellent paper on this region,
including in his study some deep sea fish.

1 NUCLEUS HABENULARIS, figs. 2, 13, N.H.

The habenular nuclei are present in their usual places in the brains of Diaphus,
Saurida, and Bathypterois, and are especially conspicuous in the Bathypterois brain
due to the great reduction of the optic tectum. Grerse (1904, p. 22) noted that the
right habenular ganglion was larger than the left in the deep sea fish Cyclothone.
