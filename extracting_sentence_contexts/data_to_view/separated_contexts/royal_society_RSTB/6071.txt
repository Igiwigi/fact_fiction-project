A is spiral, B has I, and I, united. Sections a, 6 and ¢ at different levels,
all x 42

above the level of insertion of P, (Nos. 125a, 53a, 16a, 113a, 1238), while for one,
No. 33a, the level could not be determined. The following explanation of these facts may be suggested. The surface of the
normal apex in this species rises only slightly above the bases of the youngest leaves,
especially in the first half of the plastochron, as was pointed out in section 3. Conse-
quently when the apex was first split the base of the wound must always have been
well below the upper contour of the insertions of the P,’s, and even the top of the
wound cannot have been more than a very little above that level.
