HatcuerrT's Experiments on the various Alloys,

which are neither sufficiently malleable to be rolled, nor suffi-
ciently brittle to be reduced into powder; and this last difficulty
most frequently occurs in mixed or alloyed metals. It is well known, that the specific gravity of an alloyed metal
is seldom that which, by calculating the respective specific
gravities and proportions of the different metals, would be the
result; on the contrary, the specific gravity of the alloyed mass,
is frequently greater or less than it ought to be, according to
calculation. This effect has been often noticed by various authors; and it
is not requisite that I should here repeat facts already 80 well
established ; I have, however, thought it proper to state, in the
following pages, the changes in specific gravity which took place,
when gold was alloyed with different proportions of various
metals. In the following experiments, I employed a very accurate
balance, which was made for me by Mr. Haas, and which,
when loaded with 1000 grains at each end, turned with ;2- of
a grain.
