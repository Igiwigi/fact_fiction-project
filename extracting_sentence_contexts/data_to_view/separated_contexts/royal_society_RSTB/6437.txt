101, Plate 6) there are eleven coelomic cavities in the abdomen, and of
which the first ten show a division into three portions, viz., into a dorso-rostral, a
dorso-anal, and a ventral pouch. The last or eleventh abdominal coelom (fig. 16, Plate 2, and fig. 101, Plate 6)
does not show this triple division and is, in fact, very short-lived. It consists of a
pair of long, narrow cavities running dorsally along the proctodaeum. Its walls, as
seen both in transverse and longitudinal sections, are distinct from the proctodaeal
mesoderm, so that there is no doubt of the independent existence of the eleventh
abdominal coelom.
