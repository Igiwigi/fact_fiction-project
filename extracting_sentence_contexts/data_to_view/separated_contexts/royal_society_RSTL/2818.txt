These facts prove, beyond
a doubt, that the transmitted colours, though wholly unlike to those of thin plates,
are yet produced by the same cause and are residuary, and generally complementary
to the hue of the reflected tints. The analysis of these colours by the prism affords a series of most beautiful and
instructive phenomena, and it is only by coloured drawings that any adequate idea of
them can be conveyed. All the phenomena of coloured media, with bands of various
breadths and various intensities of illumination, are exhibited in great perfection, 80
as to identify completely in this feature the two classes of facts. But what is till
more striking, the colours of the bands are changed, and we thus find that the cha-
racteristic phenomenon of absorption is produced by the action of thin plates. To
such a degree indeed is the change of tint carried, that I have insulated a white band
in the orange part of the spectrum.
