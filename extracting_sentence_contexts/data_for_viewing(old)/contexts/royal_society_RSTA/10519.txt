have in all probability a lunar as well as a solar diurnal variation. The incidence
of the selected 5 quiet days in the lunar month is largely a matter of accident, and
consequently the way in which the lunar variation affects hourly values based on the
selected 5 quiet days must vary from month to month, The lunar influence appears
however to be so small that any uncertainty on this ground must be trifling, even
in the case of data from a single year, and when we are dealing with data from
5 or 6 years, the uncertainty should be no greater than in the case of data derived
from all days in a single month,

A further point that is more fully dealt with in § 31 need only be mentioned now.
The hours to which the curve measurements refer are G.M.T., whereas a true solar
diurnal variation is connected presumably with the true local solar time. The fact
that noon at Kew is 1$ minutes later than noon at Greenwich is comparatively
unimportant, as the difference is small and affects all seasons of the year alike, but
the considerable annual range—some 31 minutes—in the “equation of time” must
be borne in mind.

§ 19. A really serious difficulty remains to be mentioned. The Kew magneto-
graphs are placed in a room partly underground in the basement of the Observatory,
where the annual variation of temperature, though much less of course than in an
unprotected upstairs room, still amounts to some 20°F, At some seasons of the
year this implies a somewhat troublesome change of temperature from day to day,
but speaking generally there is seldom a difference of more than 1° F., and usually
only a difference of a few tenths of a degree between the mean temperature on
