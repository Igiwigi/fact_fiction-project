The comparison of the boiling-points of the corresponding terms in the several series
of homologous substances given in the preceding Tables, exhibits several other con-
stant differences in the boiling-points for certain differences in the formulze. In addition

to those hitherto noticed, the following also deserve to be mentioned, since they are like-
wise observed in other compounds.

The foregoing Tables afford many illustrations of the facts, that the boiling-point of an
acid lies 63? higher than that of the methyl-ether, 44* higher than that of the ethyl-ether,
and 132 lower than that of the amyl-ether of the same acid. These regularities appear
to obtain in the case of acids other than those quoted. The boiling-point of monochlor-
acetic acid (185*%—188*, R. HorPMANN) has been found about 44* higher than that of
the monochloracetate of ethyl (143%5, WiLiar). Starting from the boiling-point of tri-
chloracetate of methyl (145%, Laure), or from that of trichloracetate of ethyl (164,
LeBLaxc), the boiling-point of trichloracetic acid is found by calculation to be 208*.
Dumas found it between 195® and 200%, From the boiling-point of monobromacetic
acid, 208?, observed by PERKIN and Dourra, that of the corresponding methyl-ether may
be calculated at 1459, that of the ethyl-ether at 164, and that of the amyl-ether at 221®.
The results of observation are 1449, 159®, 207% They are not, however, entirely to be
relied upon, since the ethers of monobromacetic acid, and especially those possessing
