long; this permits a small spot of light to pass through
and fall upon the sensitised paper (see figs. 9 and 10). In reference to the optical arrangements of my photographer recorder, I have
to draw attention to the fact that, unlike most seismograph or magnetograph
recorders, there is no cylindrical lens interposed in the path of the beams of light
reflected from the mirrors of the galvanometer, but that the image of the slit in front
of the Nernst lamp falls on the very narrow horizontal slit placed anterior to the
plane of the recording surface. It is to the abolition of this cylindrical lens—an
abolition rendered possible by the great luminosity of the Nernst lamp which was
employed in the place of the usual and much feebler lamps used in seismographs and
magnetographs—together with the substitution of finely worked platinised quartz
lenses in the place of silvered glass lenses in the galvanometer, that I attribute the
remarkable definition of the curves obtained by my recorder. The recording paper is being continuously drawn over a roller, at the rate of

1 mm, per minute, by means of the needle points fitted in the middle of a roller, which
is driven by the clock through the train of wheels.
