hyphee are very curious. In the cells filled with corpuscles they are short, often much
branched, extremely delicate, and apparently springing from the cell-walls, though
really coming from hyphe running in and through the substance of the cell-walls
(figs. 12, 17).

Sections through young and actively growing tubercles show that the hyphw branch
and pass from cell to cell throughout the meristem of the interior (figs. 7-18). In
very young tubercles the cells contain only these hyphz ; subsequently, when the
tubercle reaches the dimensions of a mustard-seed, the tiny bacterium-like bodies begin
to accumulate.

In sections through very young tubercles, made transversely to the long axâ€™s of the
root, and passing axially through the tubercle, I have observed the following facts.
A fairly strong hypha, several times thicker than the cell-walls in many cases, can be
traced through from the epiderinis to the origin of the young tubercle (figs. 7, 8, 9) ;
the tip of the tubercle is always directed so as to meet this hypha.

I had frequently satisfied myself of this fact, before more fortunate preparations
showed the facts explained by figs. 9 and 13, Here, as is seen, the hypha referred
to passes down the cavity of a root-hair, and thence traverses the cortex of the root,
cell by cell, beginning to branch when it enters the mass of tissue which constitutes
the young tubercle. It is more difficult to see the branches in the meristem of the
tubercle, for two chief reasons : the cells are smaller and more numerous, and their walls
are very thin. Moreover, their protoplasm and nuclei are very bright. Nevertheless
the difficulty is only relative, and, as already stated, FRANK had already seen the
