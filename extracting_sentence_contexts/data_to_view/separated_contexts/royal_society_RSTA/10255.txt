This strongly supports the theory
that allotropic silver is of the nature of the media we have discussed.

(v.) Carey Lua’s silvers were very brittle, but could be toughened by heating. Further, his gold-coloured silver could be transformed into normal silver by
shaking; and this transformation could be greatly impeded by packing the
gold-coloured silver in cotton wool. These properties suggest a discontinuous
structure for allotropic silver.

(vi.) If we might assume an absorption graph of n« for blue light, the fact that

’

if light is obliquely reflected from a film of “ B” silver, then the yellow light
is polarised in the plane of incidence and the blue perpendicular to that plane
can, I think, be explained by our theory : but the proof is not yet complete.

(vii.) The red colour exhibited by all the more dilute forms of the allotropie silver
is in accordance with thé fact, exhibited by the graph, that ax is smaller for

red than for yellow light for small values of 1.

| Appenprx, added 28th July, 1904.—Using the values of the retiactive index
and absorption coefficient of gold for red (C), green (E), and blue light, as given by
Rvusens (‘ Wied. Ann.,’ 1889), the following values of the quantity 8/A, which
governs the absorption of the gold glass, have been calculated :-—

Red (C). Red (630).
