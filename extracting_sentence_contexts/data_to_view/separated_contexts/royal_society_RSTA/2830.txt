It is important, however, to consider each event
in the context of longer-term conditions. The fact that the Permian-Triassic was already a
hothouse world may have been significant. In fact, the PTME events exacerbated certain long-
term processes, as noted, including increasing temperatures, increasing aridification and reducing
atmospheric oxygen throughout the Permian, and continuing into the Triassic [16]. When
hyperthermals strike during ice-house conditions, the effects and impacts on life might be
different. Further, some of the consequences of major eruption at the PTB, including global warming,
acid rain, mass wasting and marine anoxia, may have been repeated two or three times during the
Early Triassic when comparable isotopic perturbations occurred [67].
