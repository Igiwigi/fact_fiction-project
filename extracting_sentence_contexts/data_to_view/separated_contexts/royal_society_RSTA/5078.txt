The numbers given in this Table, combined with the fact that we always
much larger ratio (of which the mean is 5Â°8), when the film is thin enough to
the black, are certainly consistent with the view than when the same colour is
duced, the ratio is, at all events, approximately the same, and that, therefore,
change in specific conductivity indicated by the value of the ratio is a functio
the thickness. The connection is further illustrated by the curve on p. 526. We now proceed to consider films formed of liquid, -to which a metallic
been added.
