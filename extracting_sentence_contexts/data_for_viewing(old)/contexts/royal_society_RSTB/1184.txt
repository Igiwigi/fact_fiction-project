'= (1.) The clonic stage invariably begins with small, often single discharges, vide fig. 6,
fhese soon increase in strength. This is of course closely imitated by the graphic

cords of the muscle, the contractions of which, minimal at first, become, later,
dhaximal. j
8 (2.) The further development of the stage is marked by summation of the impulses,

e rhythm of which, directly measured, appears to be about 10 per sec., but we
Bave not yet had time to thoroughly investigate this point. (Vide graphic method,
. 273.)

The summation of the electrical variations yery obviously harmonises with all the
other facts relating to the persistence of the muscular contraction, when produced
by cortical stimulation. (See also Francois Franck and Busnorr and HEIDENHAIN,
loc. cit.) ;

(8.) The termination of the series of intermittent variations is marked by their
becoming fewer, larger, and finally ceasing abruptly (vide fig. 6), very rarely
diminishing to final disappearance.
