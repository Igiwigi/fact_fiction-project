equations. We choose T > 0 so that for t € [0, T] we have deto(id + Q'(t)) 4 0.and ||Q'(E)Il3,(Q;9) < 1. Then
there exists a unique solution G € C*([0,T]; Dom(D) MN Dom(B)) to the Riccati relation which necessarily
satisfies G(0) = Go and the Riccati evolution equation

aG=C + DG — G(A + BG).

Proof. By direct computation, differentiating the Riccati relation P = GQ with respect to time
using the product rule, using the base and auxiliary equations and feeding back through the
Riccati relation, we find (0;G)Q = 0;P — Ga;Q = (C + DG)Q — (G(A + BG))Q. Equivalencing with
respect to Q, i.e. postcomposing by Q~!, establishes the result. a

Remark 2.7. We assume throughout this paper that C = C(t) is a bounded operator, indeed that
CeC*([0,T];32(Q;P)). In fact in every application in §4 we take C=O. However, in general,
C=C(t) would represent some non-homogeneous forcing in the Riccati equation satisfied by G =


G(t). Further, in Doikou et al. [34] we apply our methods here to stochastic partial differential
equations. One example therein features additive space-time white noise. In that case the term
C=C(f) represents the non-homogeneous space-time white noise forcing term and we must thus
allow for C = C(t) to be an unbounded operator.

We now turn our attention to applications of theorem 2.6 and demonstrate how to find
solutions to a large class of partial differential systems with non-local quadratic nonlinearities.
Guided by our results above, we now suppose the classes of operators we have considered
thus far to be those with integral kernels on R x R. For x,y € R and t > 0, suppose the functions
