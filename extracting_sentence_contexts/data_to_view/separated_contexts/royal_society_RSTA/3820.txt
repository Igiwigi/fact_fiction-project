for all time. Since the equations involve h, and h varies
with the time, one further equation is required before we can express the co-ordinates
at any time in terms of the initial values of the co-ordinates and the time. This
additional equation is supplied by the fact that N, the total number of molecules,
remains constant. MR. J. H. JEANS ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF MOLECULAR ENERGY. 423

We have (see ยง 23, equation (xiii) ),
