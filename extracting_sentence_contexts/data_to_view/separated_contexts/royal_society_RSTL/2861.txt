None of the oxalates of the magnesian class of oxides is more soluble in oxalic
acid than in water, and none of them combines with that acid to form a binoxalate. The crystals, which are obtained on mixing together solutions of binoxalate of potash
and sulphate of magnesia, and which have been supposed to be a binoxalate of mag-
nesia, are really a mixture of oxalate of magnesia and of quadroxalate of potash. Hence there is no combination of oxalate of magnesia with oxalate of water ; which
illustrates the fact that bodies of the same class, such as these two oxalates are, have
no disposition to enter into union and form a new compound. 4. Orzalate of Lime. 'The oxalate of lime contains two atoms of water, like the oxalate of magnesia, but
parts with its water more freely than that salt.
