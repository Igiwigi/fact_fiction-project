24 hours. Thus there need be no fear of contamination from foreign sperm if the
water has stood at least three or four days in the laboratory before being used. All
our “ outside” water was allowed to stand at least a week before being used, and
in the majority of instances two weeks and sometimes three. We have never had
any of our controls of unfertilized eggs go wrong from the use of this water, so
we feel certain no contamination could arise from this source. ‘Io make doubly
certain, however, during the last two years of our work we have taken the extra
precaution of filtering all “ outside” water through a Berkefeld filter. The only

difticulty we have encountered with the use of this water arises from the fact that
its purity and high alkalinity render it a medium in which bacteria and infusoria
multiply with great rapidity.

The true alkalinity of the “ outside” water, that is the concentration of the
hydrogen ion, expressed in gramme-equivalents per litre, has been determined at
Plymouth by D. J. Marrnews by means of the colorimetric method of S6RENSEN.
According to S6rENsen’s (82) determination the dissociation constant of pure water
is 107" at 18° C., and a litre of pure water at this temperature would therefore
contain 10-7” gramme-equivalents of hydrogen ions, and the same number of hydroxyl
ions. He expresses for convenience the acidity of a solution by the symbol Py,
which is the numerical value of the exponent of the concentration of the hydrogen
ion, with the sign changed. Thus for pure neutral water P,, owing to the change
