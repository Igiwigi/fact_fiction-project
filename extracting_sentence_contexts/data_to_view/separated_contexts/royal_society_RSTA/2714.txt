* GLAISHER, ‘ Phil. Trans.,’ 1870, p. 367. [+ Note added September 20, 1912.—The calculation referred to was given at length in the paper as
originally communicated ; the analysis is, however, somewhat tedious and hardly necessary in view of the
fact that (13) is obtained according to the assumption that the direct radiation is considered independently
of the scattered radiation within the small solid angle ». It is to be expected, therefore, that the
attenuation of direct radiation in a parallel beam of solar radiation may be considered independently of
the scattered radiation consistently with the above assumption leading immediately to (23); the considera-
tion of the attenuation of the total radiation confirms this point and leads to the same result, The writer
is indebted to the referees for the above suggestion. |
