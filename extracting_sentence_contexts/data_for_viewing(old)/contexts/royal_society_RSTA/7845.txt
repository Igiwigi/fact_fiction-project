so that they may be easily compared with the values deduced from the magnetization
data. The general character of the two sets of curves is very similar, but the magneto-
caloric values are lower. For H = 15,000 the magnetization values are higher by a
rough average amount of 14°). This discrepancy is about the same as that found

in comparing the calculated and observed specific heat, about 10%, as mentioned
above, and the greater part of it is undoubtedly due to the neglect of the thermal
capacity of the part of the thermocouple in contact with the specimen. The dis-
crepancy, however, is greater for H = 7000 over the range T = 300°—360°, being
about 25°. It probably arises from the fact that the value of C, used corresponds
to constant intrinsic magnetization ; and this will differ more from the value
appropriate for constant apparent magnetization (which strictly is required) at the
lower than at the higher fields. Apart from this, the general agreement between
the values of (1/c) (@E/éc) derived from the two sets of data, allowing for a correction
for the thermal capacity of the thermocouple, is remarkably close.
