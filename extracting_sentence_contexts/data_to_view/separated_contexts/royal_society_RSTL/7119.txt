A. ball as the concrete s8ymbol of an indivisible whole, may
advantageously represent, as occasion requires, a unit of weight, a sImple weight, an
event. We are perfectly free, when it its our purpose, to make use of s8wch concep-
tions. Tt is, however, a fatal illusion to mistake the snggestions of fancy for the realities
of nature, and such a symbol becomes open to serious objection unless we carefully dis-
criminate between conjecture and fact. Under the baneful influence of such hypotheses
the methods of positive science lose their hold upon the mind, until at length we are
actually informed by the consistent advocates of these ideas that the science of chemistry
has no other field for its activity than the obscure region of atomic speculations. Now a symbolic calculus affords the same indispensable aid which is given by the
atomic theory, but in a more truthful and effectual way.
