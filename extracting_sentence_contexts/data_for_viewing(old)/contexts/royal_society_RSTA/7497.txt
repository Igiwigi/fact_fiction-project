of theorem 1, then

(ABS! 0 | var | A’B’S'w) = (A | var | A’) (B| B’) +(B| var |B’) (A| 4’), (9)

and = (ABS!w| H| A’B’S'w) = CA, 4’) C(B, B’) (ABS'0 | inv | A’B’S' 0)
+(A | var | A’) (B| B’)+(B| var |B’) (A| A’). (10)
Proof. By the usual removal of the w operator and the fact that all contributions to the
integral arising from different S! groupings are contained in the invariant, the result follows.

Comment. Two particular results follow from this theorem, the first of which will be used
repeatedly below. Using the fact that (s?S! | var | s?S') = 0 from table 9, part VII, it follows
from (b) that

ghere X and Y are similar connected sets of co-detors with S' symmetry, with all their
@ementary functions orthogonal to sd and sB.

5 Using the fact that —C(sA?S'sBsC'S!w, sAsCS!sB?S!0) = —1 (12)
gad (sA?S! sBsCS! w | var | sAsCS! sB?S!) = 2[sAsC | sBsC]? (13)

(sA?S! sBS! XS! | var | sA?S! sB?S! YS!) = (X| var | Y), (11)

Ghese results follow from a detailed examination, but will not be proved here as they are
Ea, consequence of a theorem which will be proved in the next part of this series),
