And while we might be able to know what the goals of such
a programme should be (based on the moral grounding and on practical needs), we cannot say
what the goals, once agreed upon, will be. Will the programme command sufficient funds? Will it
address both risk reduction and after-the-fact recovery? Will the vexing ‘l-word’ (liability) be part
of the equation? Questions like these are not climate-controlled the way a home is.
