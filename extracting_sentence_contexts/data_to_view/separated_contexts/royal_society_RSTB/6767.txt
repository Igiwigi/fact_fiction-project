The former group includes the Protobranchia, some of the Filibranchia, the
Eulamellibranchia and the Septibranchia; the latter the Pseudolamellibranchia (as
re-established by Pelseneer in 1911) and the remaining Filibranchia. Atkins suggests
that the second group is not derived from the same stock as the first and that the
Nuculidae cannot therefore be regarded as ancestral to them. But she bases this on the
assumption that “It seems very improbable. . . that such useful structures in the ciliary
method of feeding as eu-latero-frontal cilia once possessed would be lost, so long as the
method of obtaining food remained the same.” But this statement disregards the fact
that filtration of water through the gill is controlled by muscular action and blood
pressure as well as by the latero-frontal cilia. This has been shown conclusively by
Elsey (1935) in Ostrea gigas and QO. lurida. It will be impossible to assess the value of
Atkins’ suggestions until the relative importance of these additional mechanisms con-
trolling filtration have been determined in ctenidia with and without large eu-latero-
frontal cilia.
