39. Consider now the forms (ijk) {ij} {kl} {lm} {mi}i,. Ifany {ab} is a,b, the form is reducible.
If {kl} is (klu) the form can be written (ijk) (klu) {ij} {Im} {mi}i,, and is reduced by [g,,7,]
followed by [g;, m of {mi}]. If {lm} is (/mu) the form is (ijk) (mu) {tj} {kl} {mi}i,, and is reduced
the [g,,7,] followed by [g,, m of {mi}]. Hence it is only necessary to consider the four types

In each case, ijklm is a permutation of 01234. As a matter of fact all these are reducible.

40. Consider first the forms (i) and (ii). Clearly p + k,/, g + l,m or else the form reduces.
By [g,,k,] the forms are skew in j, k; hence p +j. By [g,,/,] each form is reducible if g =/.
By [g,, /,] each form is reducible if ¢ = k. Hence the only possible irreducible forms are those

for which g = i, p = m. The form can then be written (zk) (iu) {mi} (' 2 ! F ") i,, and is seen
