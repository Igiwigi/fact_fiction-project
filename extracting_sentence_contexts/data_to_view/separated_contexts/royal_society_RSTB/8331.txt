Among the factors that contributed to this outcome are
the high costs of reforestation with native plants (when there
is low potential for natural regeneration), the uncertainties of
legislation and the lack of economic incentives. Although MT’s achievements in reducing deforestation can
be considered fragile [47], this region has a level of governance
that is more effective in controlling deforestation than most
other tropical countries. DeFries et al. [49], for example,
found that very few tropical forest countries (two of 36) have

national-level governance and monitoring capacity similar to
Brazil, despite the fact that about one-third of these countries
currently face pressures similar to Brazil for expansion of
export-oriented agricultural production.

5. Challenges ahead

The papers in this issue collectively point to some key consider-
ations for MT and other agricultural frontiers across the tropics. First, land-use changes in commodity-driven agricultural fron-
tiers such as MT respond rapidly to multiple forces, including
global markets, international pressures for sustainably pro-
duced commodities, and policies at the national-, state- and
municipality-level.
