The superficial groovings were not uniformly distributed over the whole face of the
terrace, but occurred here and there where the ice had yielded most to the pressure. I
examined several of these places, and in each instance found the superficial grooving to
be the exponent of the true veined structure underneath, the structure being in general
nearly vertical, while the lines of bedding were horizontal. The coarse bands which
marked the division of the beds were also seen underneath, when the s8urface of the ice
was removed. Having perfectly, and with deliberation, satisfied myself of these facts, I
made a speedy retreat; for the ice blocks were most threatening, and the time of day
that at which they fall most frequently.

We now resolved to try the ascent of the glacier to the right ; it was much riven, but
perfectly practicable to a good iceman. To me it was also perfectly delightful ; in fact,
as regards the relationship of structure and stratification, this glacier taught me more
than all the others I had visited taken together. Our way lay through fissures which
exposed magnificent sections, and every step forward added further demonstration to
what I had already observed at the base of the fall. The bedding was perfectly distinet,
and the structure equally s0, the one being at a high angle—sometimes at a right angle
—to the other, Among these crevasses the pressure was in s0me cases greater than on
the fall, and the structure proportionally more pronounced. 'The crumpling of the beds
demonstrated the exercise of the pressure, and the structure went straight through s8uch
crumplings, thus furnishing me with numerous parallels to the case observed by Pro-
tessor SEDGWICK, Mr. SoRBY, and others, of the passage of slaty cleavage through con-
torted beds. Indeed I question whether the phenomena of cleavage and bedding, in
the case of slate rocks, were ever exhibited, side by side, with a distinctness equal to
