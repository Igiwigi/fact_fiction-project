We may suppose also that the energy necessary to enable a corpuscle to escape
from a hydrogen atom at the surface falls off as the concentration of the hydrogen
atoms on the surface increases. In this way the diminution of Q by the presence of
hydrogen can be explained. According to this view the number of corpuscles in a,
cubic centimetre of the metal cannot be deduced from the constant A.

It seems probable that the temporary positive leak from platinum and palladium,
when they are first heated, is due to the presence of a small amount of some
decomposable compound or volatile impurity. This view is supported by the fact that
platinum wires, well cleaned with nitric acid, do not give this effect to an extent

Q appreciable on the galvanometer.
~ The positive leak in gases at high pressures is no doubt due to ionization of the
2 gas molecules at the surface of the platinum.

oA In conclusion, I wish to say that my best thanks are due to Professor J. J. THomMson
Ss for advice and kindly interest in these experiments while they were being carried out
te} at the Cayendish Laboratory.
