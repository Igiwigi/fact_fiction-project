It is evident that there-must be a precise quantity in-which
the elements of compounds are united together in them, other-
wise a matter, which was nota simple one, would be liable,
in its several masses, to vary from itself, according as one or
other of its ingredients chanced to predominate ; but chemical
experiments are unavoidably attended with too many Sources
of fallacy for this precise quantity to be discovered by them ;
it is therefore to theory that we must owe the knowledge of
it. For this purpose an hypothesis must be made, and its
justness tried by a strict comparison with facts. If they are
found at variance, the assumed hypothesis must be relin-
quished with candour as erroneous, but should it, on the con-
trary prove, on a multitude of trials, invariably to accord with
