We show a net decrease
in relative developmental diversity across all latitudes, with
species that display aplanktonic development in Antarctic
waters being the most vulnerable. Because temperature affects the distribution of develop-
mental modes and developmental modes affect dispersal, the
future of marine connectivity may seem straightforward to
anticipate. However, such predictions are complicated by the
fact that temperature affects another key driver of dispersal
in marine systems—development duration [24]. The larval developmental rate depends strongly on temp-
erature [13,25]. The relationship between temperature and
developmental duration is exponential (at least within benign
temperature ranges)—a small increase in temperature can
reduce developmental durations significantly [26].
