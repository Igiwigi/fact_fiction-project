refer to this slightly abstract construct as an ‘LN element’
(figure 1) to distinguish it from simple cells. The response

‘false’ match

of a single LN element will still depend upon the spatial 2
phase of a luminance grating, and so to build model complex a
cells it is usual to combine two LN elements that have RFs in x
quadrature (the RF in the second element is obtained by shift- z
ing all of the Fourier components through 90°). The fact that 3

the two LN elements are in quadrature confers phase invari-
ance on the model complex cell. The fact that the response of
both LN elements depends on disparity makes the model
sensitive to interocular phase difference.

Note that once a single monocular RF has been defined
(of any shape), these rules completely define a model com-
plex cell selective for zero disparity (with identical RFs in
each eye, as in figure 1). Thus, BEMs can be built with any
shape of RF, although almost all studies have used Gabor
functions to describe the monocular RFs. Although it has
always been recognized that this compact description is
bound to be an oversimplification, it nonetheless provided
a powerful framework for understanding both the responses
