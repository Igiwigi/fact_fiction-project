(VAR) model, which can unambiguously provide causal information only when instantaneous
effects are negligible. We remark that the term instantaneous should not be taken literally, as
instantaneous influences may be due to interactions whose time scale is much faster than the
time resolution of the measurements. Instantaneous influences might be due to unobserved
confounders or insufficient sampling rate that cannot be increased because the mechanism of
generation of the variable is inherently slow. The latter is the case with the heart and the
cardiovascular system, intended as a dynamical systems whose activity is paced by the heartbeat;
many of the output variables of these systems, such as the heart period and the systolic arterial
pressure (SAP), can be measured once per cardiac beat and thus cannot be assessed at a faster
pacing. Such a problem often shows up in the analysis of physiological time series [7,8]; a solution
to this issue has been proposed in [9] introducing an extended GC measure in the frequency
domain that takes into account both lagged and instantaneous influences. A main limitation of
this approach is the fact that it assigns a direction to zero-lag effects, and the proposed measure
depends on such an assignment. On the other hand, in some cases, a preferential direction
for instantaneous influences cannot be assigned a priori [10], and more generally instantaneous
interactions in VAR models should be un-directed, as discussed in [11].

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to deal with instantaneous interactions in
the spectral formulation of GC, which (i) exploits a recently introduced framework [12] that
allows one to quantify causal influences in a stochastic dynamical system, both in the time
and frequency domains; (ii) introduces a measure of undirected instantaneous causality for
multivariate systems; (iii) introduces a measure of extended GC that takes into consideration
both lagged and instantaneous causality and does not depend on the direction of instantaneous
interactions; (iv) significantly speeds up the evaluation of the model parameters compared to
the original proposal [12]. Our approach, differently from [9], does not provide the direction of
