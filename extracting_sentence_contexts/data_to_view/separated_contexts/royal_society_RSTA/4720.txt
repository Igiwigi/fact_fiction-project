Ze, > Zo hP Ale. Contravariant, Set-valued functors are traditionally called presheaves, hence the name. As we
saw above, each Gelfand spectrum Y- = X(C) is, in fact, a compact Hausdorff space, and each
restriction map X(ic,c,)="c,c, is a continuous map, so the spectral presheaf takes values in
KHaus, the category of compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps. There is an obvious W*-analogue to all these constructions, which gives the spectral presheaf
of a non-Abelian W*-algebra (or von Neumann algebra, if we implicitly use a representation on
a Hilbert space, as we usually do). For clarity, we use the notation VV for a W*- or von Neumann
algebra from now on, and V(N) for the context category, i.e. the poset of Abelian W*- or von
Neumann subalgebras of V.
