PLASTIC STRAIN IN MILD STEEL. 148

- It is noteworthy, however, that a scale effect has been observed by Sranvon and
Bartson* in impact tests. Although similarity was maintained both in the specimen
and in the testing appliances, the energy per unit volume (which has the dimensions of
stress) was found to increase as the size was reduced. It appeared, moreover, that the
effect was greater in steel of lower carbon content, a tendency also shown by the present
tests. No explanation of the effect was given, but it was suggested that it might
possibly lie in the fact that similarity had not been extended to the microstructure.

Conditions during Overstrain.—The investigation has shown that in the initial stages
of overstrain of mild steel in torsion, flexure, and by internal pressure, there is a con-
siderable reduction in the stress carried by the overstrained portions, corresponding to
that observed in the tensile stress-strain diagram, in the region immediately following
the yield point. The values of the shear stress accompanying the plastic strain,
estimated from the load-displacement diagrams in each case by the method described
in the paper, are summarised in Table X.
