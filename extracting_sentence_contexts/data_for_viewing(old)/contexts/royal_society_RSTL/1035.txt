was composed as here determined by actual experiments, and
compute the force required to burst the barrel, it will be found
equal to the pressure of a weight of 4106244 lbs. instead of
4.36800 as before determined. For it is the resistance or force of
cohesion of 1 inch of this iron to 63173 lbs., as that of 6Z
inches (the area of the fracture of the barrel) to 410624 lbs.
And this weight turned into atmospheres, in the manner above
described, gives 34750 atmospheres for the measure of the force
which must have been exerted by the elastic fluid in bursting the
barrel. But this force, enormous as it may appear, must still
fall short of the real initial force of the elastic fluid generated in
the combustion of gunpowder, before it has begun to expand ;
for it is more than probable that the barrel was in fact burst
before the generated elastic fluid had exerted all its force, or
that this fluid would have been able to have burst a barrel still
stronger than that used in the experiment. â€”But I wave these
speculations in order to hasten to more interesting and more

satisfactory investigations. Passing over in silence a consider-
