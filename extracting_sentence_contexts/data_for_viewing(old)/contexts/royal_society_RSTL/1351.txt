view of ascertaining, whether contractions would arise, agree-
ably to Mr. VoLTA's declaration, from the influence passing
through a portion of the nerve without entering the muscles.
Having finished this experiment, I immediately after applied
the same probe between the silver coating of the nerve and
the naked muscles, and was surprised to see these contract. A
Second and third'application were followed by the same effects,
but further applications were of no avail. It then occurred
to me that motions might re-appear, if I again touched the
two coatings with the probe, and the event proved the conjec-
ture to have been fortunate ; for after every application of the
probe to the two coatings, contractions were several times ex-
Cited by it. The fact being thus established, that under certain
Circumstances contractions could be produced by silver alone,

it next became a subject of inquiry, whether this was owing to
any disposition of the muscles and nerve, which had been in-,
duced upon them by Mr. VoLTA's experiment, or whether,
the condition of the muscles and nerve being unaltered by
that experiment, the silver had gained some new property by
