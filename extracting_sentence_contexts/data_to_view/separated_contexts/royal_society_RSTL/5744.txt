X

which may also be written

L=%#4 ( @, b )_2(a—b9) (1, 0 ),
+ _2(ad—be)

| &, @ oY
or, what is the 8ame thing. —_a+d 2(ad—be) . and it is easy to verify @ posteriori that this value in fact gives 1*—=M*. It may be
remarked that if

W=o 1, 0 Y=1,
[ 0, 1|
we have X=0; it will be 8een presently that the

=1 admits of other solutions besides L=+1. The example shows how the
s of the fractional Powers of a matrix are to be investigated.
