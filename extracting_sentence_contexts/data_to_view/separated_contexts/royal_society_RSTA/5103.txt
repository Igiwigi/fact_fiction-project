We note the significant difference between semi-nonlinear and nonlinear hybrid methods
around roll resonance. The differences between semi-nonlinear and nonlinear hybrid methods are
not as large at heave resonance. The latter facts are consistent with the numerically predicted roll
damping and heave damping at resonance (figure 8) as functions of roll and heave amplitude,
respectively. For example, in the semi-nonlinear simulation with wave steepness ay the roll
amplitude is 7.6° at roll resonance and the heave amplitude is 4.5mm at the heave resonance;
in the nonlinear simulation, the roll amplitude is 4.9° at roll resonance and the heave amplitude
is 3.9mm at the heave resonance. The roll damping coefficient in figure 8 is obtained by calculating the damping moment about
the COG (180° out of phase with the roll angular velocity) due to forced roll about the COG by
both hybrid methods.
