This change highlights the exclusion of several combinations of the elastic modulus
and the effective height. This aspect is particularly evident in figure 7. Indeed, despite the
fact that the elastic modulus and the effective height can be considered as independent, these
two parameters jointly contributed to the definition of the natural period of the tower. This
consideration explains the shape of the posterior joint-PDF, highlighted in figure 7.
