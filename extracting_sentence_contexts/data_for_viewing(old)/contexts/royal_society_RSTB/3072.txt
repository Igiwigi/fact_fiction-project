country where it lives, and Mituais (1904) refers to the fact that whereas the cubs
of this animal in most parts of Great Britain are not born until the end of March or
beginning of April, in the South of England they are frequently produced as early
as January.

The influences of domestication and captivity upon the periodicity of cestrus are
even more marked than those of climate, and the more frequent recurrence of the
cycle in the Ferret, the domestic Cat, and certain of the larger Carnivora in Zoological
Gardens must be ascribed to this cause. The periodicity of the cestrus in certain of
those animals in the Gardens at Dublin is said to be markedly affected by accom-
modation, heating, and feeding, and can to a certain extent at any rate be regulated.
This is comparable to what occurs among other mammals, such as Mares or Sheep
(Harr, 1900, MarsHaut, 1903). Taking all these facts into consideration and
remembering that the moncestrous condition, so far as is known, occurs most commonly
among animals in a state of nature, it may, perhaps, be inferred that this is the more
primitive condition, polycestrum being secondarily acquired not merely within the
limits of the order Carnivora, but in the Mammalia as a whole.*

3.—The Histology of the Uterus during the Cycle.

For the purpose of describing the changes through which the non-pregnant uterus
of the Bitch passes, we divide the cestrous cycle into four periods as follows :—

(1) Period of rest . . . . . . . Ancestrum.
