conditions that would need to be met for the identification of 1.5°C pathways without substantial
overshoot or CDR deployment.

Second, exploring the lower bound of anthropogenic COz emissions brings us into deeply
uncertain territory about the future development of emissions drivers, technology and society


[14-17]. Will electric airliners come into reach 50 years from now? Will nuclear fusion finally
make good on its promise to become a commercial energy source by then? These are just two
examples of unanswerable questions on future innovation which are relevant for the assessment
of 1.5°C pathways. In the face of such deep uncertainty, available pathway modelling takes the
most tenable position of relying on the range of technologies and their learning rates described in
the literature rather than introducing unspecified backstop technologies or fictional proposals. To
go beyond this, it is useful to abstract from the details of individual pathways and associated
technology portfolios. Such an approach of reduced granularity in long-term forecasts was
suggested by Morgan & Keith [18] to explore high-level implications for long-term emissions
strategies in the presence of deep uncertainty. Here we compare 1.5°C pathways with back-of-
the-envelope projections of key determinants of future anthropogenic fossil fuel use and
assumptions of CDR deployment to explore the following question: to what extent is overshoot
and CDR needed in 1.5°C pathways? In this context, we will also ask whether energy demand-
side options that are traditionally less well represented in IAMs than energy supply-side
mitigation options have the potential to change the current perspective on 1.5°C pathways in
the literature.

The study is presented in four sections. The next section discusses the 1.5°C carbon budget
