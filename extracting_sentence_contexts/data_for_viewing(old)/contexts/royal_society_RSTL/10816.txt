With this apparatus it is easy to repeat the above-described experiments, and to
verify the following statements. ,

A jet of air at moderate pressure (below 10 mms, of water), from an orifice 1 to
13 mm. in diameter, forms a continuous column for a certain distance, beyond which
it becomes confused and breaks up.

Any impulse, such as a tap on the jet-support or a short and sharp sound, causes a
minute disturbance to start from the orifice. This disturbance increases as it
progresses, and finally causes the jet to break. By directing the jeb against a flame,
or against a hearing orifice, it is readily perceived that such disturbances travel along
the jet-path with a velocity which is not that of ound in air. In fact, the 8ound
heard in the ear-piece resembles an echo of the disturbing sound.

The disturbances produced by sounds of different pitch travel along the jet-path
with the same velocity. This is evident, since otherwise distinct reproduction of the
complex vibrations of speech at a distance from the orifice would be impossible. This
velocity is much less than that of sound in air, and is probably the mean velocity of
the jet stream.

A vibrating airJet, playing into free air, gives rise to very feeble sounds ; but these
sounds are much intensified when the stream impinges on any arrangement which
serves to divide it into two parts. Of such arrangements, a surface pierced with a
small orifice is the best, the orifice being placed in the jeb axis.
