46 Dr. ProuT on the nature of the acid and saline matters

its origin and use ; some supposing that it is derived from
the stomach itself, and is essential to the digestive process ;
others, that it is derived from the food, or is a result of fer-
mentation, &c. ; in short, there seems to be no physiological
subject s0 imperfectly understood, or concerning which there
has been such a variety of opinions. The object of the present communication is to show, that
the acid in question is the murzatic acid, and that the salts
usually met with in the stomach, are the alkaline muriates. As to the origin and use of these principles, as well as the
occasional appearance of other acids, &c. in the stomach, I
reserve what I have to say on these subjects till a future
opportunity, and shall merely remark at present, that the
facts now adduced seem to be intimately connected, not only
with the physiology and pathology of the digestive process,
but with other important animal functions. Having ascertained the circumstances above mentioned in a
general manner, and by means which it would be here un-
necessary to detail, an attempt was made to contrive some
unexceptionable method by which their truth might not only
be satisfactorily demonstrated, but at the same time that the
relative quantities of the different principles might be deter-
mined; after various attempts, the following processes were
adopted for these purposes. The contents of the stomach of a rabbit, fed on its natural
food, were removed immediately after death, and repeatedly
digested in cold distilled water till they ceased to impart any
thing to that fluid.
