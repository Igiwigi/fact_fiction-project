In transferring the isomicrasters to the Toxasteridae, Mortensen is faced with the difficulty
that Lambert & Thiéry (1924) note the presence of a vestigial sub-anal fasciole in some
examples of Micraster senonensis. He endeavours to explain away this awkward observation


MICRASTER CORANGUINUM AND M. (ISOMICRASTER) SENONENSIS 421

by suggesting that Lambert was mistaken in attributing these specimens to M. senonensis.
It is very unlikely that so acute an observer as Lambert would have made such a mistake;
and, anyhow, perfectly good examples of M. senonensis may well have a slight fasciole—
for example, specimen E32536.

Lambert (1895), in his original description of the species, comments on the fact that
M. senonensis may have a rudimentary fasciole, although this appears to have escaped
the attention of Mortensen. The fascioles in the Spatangoidea are of great adaptive
significance, and, in the evolution of a stock, a sub-anal fasciole may easily disappear
under the influence of natural selection. This has happened in the evolution of
M. senonensis. The presence or absence of a fasciole is therefore a most unsuitable
character upon which to build the major subdivisions of the amphisternatous spatangoids.

In the last volume of his Monograph on the Echinoidea (1952), Mortensen recants, to some
extent. He was informed by Melville (1951) in a letter that a well-preserved specimen of
M. (Isomicraster) stollyei showed a sub-anal fasciole. He therefore concludes that there must
have been a typical sub-anal fasciole in the young Jsomicraster. ‘This, I think, is very
doubtful—figure 10 in the present paper gives no indication that in Muicraster senonensis
