MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES AT KEW. 289

in December (representing winter) to 1:58 in March and in June (respectively repre-
senting equinox and summer). But on disturbed days we see from the figures in
Table IX, that this ratio has risen to 2°30 in winter and fallen to 0°80 in summer.

The seasonal variation in the shape of vector diagrams—the curves illustrating the
diurnal changes in the horizontal components D and H or W and N—is thus totally
different for quiet and disturbed days.

§12. Taking the year as a whole, the ratio borne by the diurnal inequality range
in W to that in N is only 1°18 on disturbed days as compared to 1:46 on quiet days.
This is due to the fact that the increase in the range of the mean diurnal inequality
as we pass from quiet to disturbed days is 91 per cent. in N as against 54 per cent.
in W. In this instance the change in passing from quiet to disturbed days is in the
same direction as that observed on quiet days when we pass from years of few to
years of many sunspots.

The mean diurnal inequality for the year in N is, on the whole, of the same type
on disturbed and quiet days. The hour of principal maximum, 7 p.m., and principal
minimum, 11 a.m., are the same in the two cases.

There is much more difference of. type in the case of W. The principal minimum
appears near midnight on disturbed days as compared with 8 a.m. on quiet days.
The most conspicuous turning point, however, the maximum, occurs in both cases in
