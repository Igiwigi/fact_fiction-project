THE FIBRES OF THE POSTERIOR ROOTS OF SOME SPINAL NERVES. 735

ConcLusIons. When the facts of the above arrangement are compared with those found to exist
in the Frog (v. supra, p. 652, &c.), it will be seen that considerable differences between
the two schemes of distribution become apparent. It seems well to return to the con-
clusions arrived at for Rana, and examine the extent of their applicability to Macacus.

1, Although in a plexus each spinal nerve-root affords separate contributions to
many several nerve-trunks in the plexus, the cutaneous distribution of the root is
composed, not of patches which are disjoined, but of patches which are so joined that

Athe distribution of the entire root forms one continuous field.
a Looking over the areas determined for Macacus in the foregoing experiments, it is
Qseen that, just as in the leg of the Frog, so with the nerve-roots of the trunk and
Slower limb of WM. rhesus, each root possesses a single undivided field of cutaneous
Sdistribution, not a field composed of separated patches. This is a point to which
Sattention was always paid in the experiments, because it was remembered that
STiRcox found evidence of such “ divided” fields in the case of certain nerve-roots, viz.,
Pthe IInd and IIIrd thoracic roots of the Dog; also because such an arrangement
comight exist with the more complexly branched plexus of Macacus, although absent
from the simpler type of the Frog.
