15 T added this note to my original paper, in order to explain more distinctly than 1 did
Sefore the analogy between the optic and magnetic axes, which guided me during the
*Sifferent stages of my researches on the magnetic induction of crystals. My intention
as not at all to enter into the mathematical solution of the great physical problem. Sill my experimental researches follow from the mere fact, that there exists an auxiliary
Mlipzoid of magnetic induction. The supposition of molecular ellipsoids of isotropic,
{Saramagnetic or diamagnetic matter, is to be regarded as a means of discovering the
| Kathematical laws to which the couple, tending to turn round a magnecrystal in a uni-
rm field, was subject, and not as establishing these laws on a basis of molecular physics. Such a basis is to be obtained by Professxor W. TrowsoNn's theory only, which I highly
Kegret not to have known when I wrote my paper.
