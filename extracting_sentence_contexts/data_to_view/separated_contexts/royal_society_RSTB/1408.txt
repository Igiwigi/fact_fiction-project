The primary xylem in this specimen has exactly the same structure
smaller stems ; the canals at the angles, containing fragments of spiral traÂ¢
perfectly evident. The secondary wood, which reaches a maximum
36 elements, agrees in every respect with that of the less advanced sp acti
medullary rays are alike, and so are the trachew, with their scalariform ; In fact, if the more central portion of the largest specimen were seen alone
not be distinguished from the corresponding region of one of the youn
which still retain the typical cortex of a Sphenophyllum. In the most advanced specimens the primary cortex has, as we shoul
entirely disappeared ; it is replaced by an enormously thick bark, formed |
sive layers of internal periderm (see Plate 84, figs. 48, 51, and 52).
