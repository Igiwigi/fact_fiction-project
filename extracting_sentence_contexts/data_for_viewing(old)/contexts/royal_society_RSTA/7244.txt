The molecular heats of formation of ZnO [hexagonal] and CdO [cubic] are 83-2 and
62-2 kcal. respectively (Becker & Roth 1933). These are the most probable figures obtained
from the results provided by various methods. That direct measurement in the bomb
furnishes the slightly higher value 83-4 kcal. for zinc oxide (Becker & Roth 1933; Roth,
Wirths & Berendt 1942) may be due to formation of small amounts of zinc carbonate
produced by interaction with the carbon dioxide from the paraflin used to aid combustion.

The values for the molecular heat of formation of B,O, [amorphous] given by Roth &
Borger (1937) and Todd & Miller (1946) are 349 and 335°8 kcal. respectively. Recently
Roth (1946) has applied corrections to these figures which apparently reduce the dis-
crepancy to almost negligible proportions. A large discrepancy still exists, however, since
a further adjustment must be applied to the figures of Todd & Miller, who, in spite of the
fact that the amount of water liberated in their experiments was sufficient to dissolve only
a small fraction of the boric acid produced, erroneously based their corrections on total
solution. The corrected value according to the experimental: data of Todd & Miller is
328-5 kcal. This differs from the amended value of Roth & Borger (340-2 keal.) by 3:5%,
an unsatisfactory state of affairs. Unfortunately the former figure rests on only two deter-
minations compared with six for the latter. In the latter figure, however, Roth (1946)
introduces an element of uncertainty by assuming that 50°% of the boric oxide remained
in the crucible where it did not become hydrated, whereas Todd & Miller mixed the
boron with benzoic acid before combustion and found that no boric oxide remained in
the crucible.* The average of the eight determinations is 337-3 keal./mol., which at present
may be regarded as the ‘most probable’ value.

The value employed for the molecular heat of formation of A1,O, [corundum] is 399-04 kcal,
