E/@(E) is specialized into Fy (t)/s(F,(t)), and we shall work
in this quotient. Examine the proof of proposition 3.3. In its course we have in fact shown that if
[Berl(f + @1)] 40 (i.e. a ¢ An UC(1)), and discx(f + a1) is coprime to discx(f + aj) for each j #1 (i.e.
a¢B, UC,), then [Berl(f + @1)] + --- + [Berl(f + a,)] 40 (i.e. a € G,). We have also demonstrated
that this must be the case for all but at most AG + 3)n?q°"-?) specializations. The same arguments
imply that if we further require that [Berl(f + «;)] 40 for eachi=1,...,r, and that disc,(f + aj) is
coprime to disc,(f + oj) for all j #1, then for any non-empty set of indices Ic {1,...,7}, we have
Nie/[Berl(f + aj)] 40, which is an equivalent statement to [Berl(f + )],...,[Berl(f + ar)] being
linearly independent in Fye(t)/@(Fq(t)).
