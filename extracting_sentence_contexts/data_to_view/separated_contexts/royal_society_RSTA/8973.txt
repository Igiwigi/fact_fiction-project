From a series of blank weighings with vessels treated as in an actual experiment
it was deduced that the probable weighing error is +0005 gr.,-a quantity which is
about the millionth part of the total weight on the pans. Other Sources of Error.—A few other sources of error have been ‘oiveid Spat but
as, in the apparatus used, their effect is never large enough to alter the results, they
will only be mentioned briefly. There is a small weighing error due to the fact that
the air contained in the water vessel} is saturated, and its density is therefore less
than that of the air in the balance case. The usual buoyancy correction might have
to be modified were it not that the vessels are weighed before and after the
experiment under practically the same circumstances. It is found that even two or
three degrees difference in the temperature of the balance case, although it causes a
change in the vapour pressure, does not affect the weighings.
