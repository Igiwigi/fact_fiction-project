Zopf (1882, p. 5) has already stated that branching is
hampered by sheaths encrusted with ferric hydroxide. (e) According to Cholodny (1926,
p- 67) there is no difference between base and apex, but how could this have been recognized
in fragments of even width? This analysis of the main items in the diagnosis of Leptothrix ochracea shows it to be in-
complete, and a real picture of the organism is in fact only obtained when its relation to
Sphaerotilus natans and Cladothrix ochracea is recognized. I would not, however, like to maintain
definitely that there is only one species of Sphaerotilus capable of producing the Leptothrix
ochracea state. It may well be that there is a second form, perhaps one adapted to lower
temperatures and therefore not growing in my cultures; certain observations and comments
in the literature, as well as Teichmannâ€™s results at a low temperature point in this direction.
