Eventually it will reach the temperature at
which it could exist in equilibrium with free carbide if the latter were present
in bulk. Precipitation will not begin at this temperature, however, if there is
appreciable surface energy between carbide crystals and solid solution. Every re-crystallisation is characterised by the fact that, in the minute crystals
first formed, the ratio of surface area to mass is relatively very great. Consequently
the surface energy may be an appreciable fraction of the total energy of these
crystals. This surface energy virtually increases the chemical potential of the
separated material and therefore tends to make the temperature at which crystals
can form, in a given solution, lower than it would be otherwise.
