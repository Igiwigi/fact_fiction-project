specimen is undoubtedly incomplete. Although several hundred specimens were
measured no change in proportion between the head and body length could be
detected with increase in size, nor were there any structural differences between the
largest and smallest specimens. The length of the head in all cases was contained
about six times in the total body length.

4, THE SKULL

The skull of Palaeospondylus is invariably preserved so that the ventral or more
rarely the dorsal surface is uppermost on the rock: a specimen preserved in lateral
view has never been found. This provides very strong evidence that the skull was
dorso-ventrally compressed in life. In the majority of specimens very little displace-
ment of the individual elements of the skull is found; in fact so rare is displacement
that great difficulty is usually experienced in determining whether certain structures
are fused or merely articulated with one another. However, in three instances con-
siderable dislocation has taken place, and these specimens, R.S.M. 1893-68-3
(figure 10, plate 22), R.S.M. A. (unnumbered), (figure 12, plate 23), I.C.S. 1171,
proved invaluable for interpreting the morphology of the skull. Dean (1900) also figures
a dislocated skull (his figure 4, plate 1). Elucidating the cranial anatomy is by no
means easy, and although about five hundred specimens were examined only a very
few were sufficiently well preserved to determine the details of the anatomy of the
head. The dorsal surface is best preserved in the following specimens: B.M.N.H.
P 22394 (figure 11, plate 22), B.M.N.H. P 22400 (figure 13, plate 23), B.M.N.H.
P 22397 and M.Z.C. 230 (all collected by Dr Forster-Cooper) ; and the ventral surface
in the following specimens: B.M.N.H.- P 22401 (figure 9, plate 22), B.M.N.H.
