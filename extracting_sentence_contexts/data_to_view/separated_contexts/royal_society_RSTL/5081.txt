The observations I am about to state will perhaps contribute a little
to obtain that end. Some years ago I ascertained the fact, that a soJution of potash, sufficiently long
treated with air ozonized (by the means of phosphorus), yields a liquid which, being
over-saturated with sulphuric acid and heated, causes a brownish coloration round
a crystal of sulphate of iron, and has the power of destroying indigo*. From that
fact I inferred at the time that the reactions indicated are due to the presence of a
nitrate. Some time after I found out that the acid liquid called phosphatic acid, produced
during the action of phosphorus upon moist atmospherie air, enjoys likewise the
property of destroying indigo. If that acid is perceptibly coloured by a solution of
indigo and left to itself, after a few hours it will have become colourless, or if the
same acid be heated, its colour will be discharged within a few minutes.
