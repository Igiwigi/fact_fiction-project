shoot ” (p. 23). It is evident that if the presence of a brachyblast in the cone of the
Abietinese postulates the ancestral presence of a vegetative spur shoot in this group,
much more does the occurrence of its prototype in the Cordaitean cone involve the
presence of a vegetative spur shoot in the more ancient group. There is, however,
no evidence in the fossil remains of the Cordaitese even to suggest such a possibility.*
There is also a lack of evidence in the living forms themselves, of the ancestral
presence of a vegetative spur shoot. In the seedling of no pine, Araucarian or other
Conifer, is there a trace of such a structure. All the Conifer series have spirally
arranged primordial leaves with a free lamina. These primordial leaves have a more
primitive organisation than the adult foliage.t They persist in the pines for a year
or more (in Pinus canariensis for many years), and can even be recalled in the
adult in many forms by wounding (Pinus rigida, etc.). Strikingly in contrast
to this is the fact that in none of the other Conifer forms does wounding revive
a spur shoot. The spur shoot of the pines must thus be considered of a cenogenetic
character. That of Woodworthia of the Triassic, which is very persistent and bears
many leaves, is clearly of a primitive type—might well be that of an Araucarian in
the initial stage of this branch specialisation, a specialisation which, together with its

* The writer wishes it to be understood that he is not trying to refute the brachyblast theory (see
THOMSON, 1909 4) of the cone scale, but only the inference which Prof. Jerrrey draws from it with
regard to the presence of a vegetative spur shoot.
