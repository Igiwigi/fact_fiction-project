the group of thirty, and it alone showed signs of life. The statement of this fact before the Royal Society, by Prof. HuxLey, brought to my

one of the hermetically sealed tubes from the wire on which it was suspended, and,
holding it up against the light, discovered, to my astonishment, a beautiful mycelium
flourishing at the bottom.
