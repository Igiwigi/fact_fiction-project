Also, the wing appears to be perfectly continuous all round the spore, and not to be
in any way sub-divided into compartments or cells. The fusion of the three abortive
sister-cells of a macrospore into such a continuous ring, is entirely without
precedent, and can hardly be assumed in the absence of any positive evidence. The
fact that the winged spores of Spencerites ave ofien found still grouped in their
original tetrads (see fig. 148) is also opposed to the interpretation of each spore as
itself representing a group of four sister-cells. On the latter assumption, we should
have tetrads of tetrads, an arrangement for which there seems to be no analogy. There is, I think, no doubt that the interpretation of the wing suggested by
Count Sorms-Lausacn is the right one,t namely, that it “represents an organ
analogous with the air-sacs of the pollen of the Pine.” When seen in sectional view,
the spore of S. insigiis bears a considerable resemblance to the pollen grain of Pinus
(see fig. 14), though, as the superficial aspect shows (see fig. 11 ; also, WILLIAMSoN,
19th Mem., Plate 7, figs. 43 and 44), its real form is quite different, for in the fossil
the air-sac forms a continuous rim all round the spore, a fact not recognised by
Count Sotms-Lausacu.
