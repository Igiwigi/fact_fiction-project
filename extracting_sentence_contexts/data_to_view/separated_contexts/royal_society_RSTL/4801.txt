q ii. Zxperimental inquiry into the laws of atmospheric magnetic action, and their
application to particular cases.

2969. BELIEVING that experiment may do much for the development of the
general principles of atmospheric magnetism, and produce rapidly a body of facts on
which philosophers may proceed hereafter to raise a superstructure, I endeavoured to
find some means of representing practically the action of the atmosphere, when heated
by the sun, upon the terrestrial magnetic curves. The object was to obtain some
central arrangement of force which should deflect these curves or lines as they are
deflected in a diamagnetic conductor or globe of hot air (2877.), and then apply the
results obtained by such an arrangement as a partial test to the various cases supplied
by the magnetic observatories seattered over the earth. At first I endeavoured, for
the sake of convenience, to attain this desired end by means of a horseshoe magnet,
employing the lines which passed from pole to pole to disturb and rearrange the
earth's force ; but the comparative weakness of the terrestrial force near the magnet,
and the great prominence of the poles of the latter, gave rise to many inconveniences,
which s00n caused me to reject that method and have recourse to a ring-helix and
voltaic apparatus.
