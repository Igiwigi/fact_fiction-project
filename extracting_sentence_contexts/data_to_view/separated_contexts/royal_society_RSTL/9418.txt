I may here state that I have also observed indications of
muscular tonus in some of the other Meduse, but for the sake of brevity I shall here
restrich myself to the consideration of this one case,

* 1 may here mention that the fact of the polypite of Sarsia undergoing this extreme elongation after

the removal of the marginal ganglia, serves to render tho artificial rhythm of the organ under the influence
of injury, as previously degcribed, all the more conspicuous,



MR. G. J. ROMANES ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF MEDUSA. 185 To my mind, then, it is an interesting fact that ganglionie tissue, where it can first,
be shown to occur in the animal kingdom, has for one of its functions the maintenance
of muscular tonus ; but it is nob on this account that I now wish to draw prominent
attention to the fact before us. Physiologists are almost unanimous in regarding
muscular tonus as a kind of gentle tetanus due to a persistent ganglionic stimulation ;
and against this opinion ib seems impossible to urge any valid objection. But, in
accordance with the accepted theory of ganglionic action, physiologists further 8uppose
that the only reason why some muscles are thrown into a state of tonus by gang-
lonie stimulation, while other muscles are thrown into a state of rhythmic action by
the same means, is because the resistance to the passage of the stimulation from the
ganglion to the musele is less in the former than in the latter case.
