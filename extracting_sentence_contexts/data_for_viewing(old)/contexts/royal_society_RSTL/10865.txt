voluntary muscles of invertebrates and vertebrates, which myohzmatin either accom-
panies, replaces, or is replaced by hzmoglobin in individual cases. I will now give an
account of the observations by which I have been led to this conclusion. I may,
however, state here that Professor Kinxg has informed me that he has long © 80s-

Myohematin in Arthropods.

It is now about two and a half years since I discovered a new spectrum in the
muscles of TTydrophilus and Dyticus. In these beetles the muscles removed from the
thorax, which have a reddish-yellow, or yellow colour, give a beautifully defined
epectrum which is remarkable, in the firsb place, for the narrowness of its bands, and, in
the second, from the fact that they differ totally from the bands of any decomposition
product of hemoglobin. Neither acid nor alkaline hematin, acid or alkaline hamato-
porphyrin, nor methzmoglobin, nor hemochromogen, has the remotest resemblance to
this pigment with regard to the spectrum. I vext found this spectrum in the alar
muscles of every insect which I examined, and afterwards in the voluntary and heart
muscles of every vertebrate, it was then systematically traced throughout the whole
animal kingdom.

To study the spectrum of myohematin uninfluenced by the presence of other pig-
ments one has only to open the thorax of the meat-fly (Mus vomitoria), place the
reddish yellow muscle in the compressorium, throw a good light through the object
and examine with the miscrospectroscope. On doing this, three bands, two of which
are of great narrowness, and beautifully sharp, are seen ; the first is placed before the
