which is indeed an explicit way to rewrite equation (2.3) in the form of an ensemble average.
Remarkably, as Si is a local (one-body) operator, its evaluation in equation (2.13) can be replaced
by the expectation value in a single superposition state [45],

Here, gj is a random phase uniformly distributed in [0,27). In fact, the state defined in
equation (2.15) is a random superposition that can successfully mimic the dynamics of ensemble
calculations and provides a quadratic speed-up of computational efforts [45-47].

(a) Short-time expansions and beyond

In order to analyse the N dependence of the LE and its time scales, we compute here the short-time
expansion of the magnitudes Mj,1(t), Myp(t) and Mx(t). Up to second order in time,
