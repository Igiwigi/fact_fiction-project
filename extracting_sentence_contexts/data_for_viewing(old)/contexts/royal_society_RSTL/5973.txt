Q ALTHOUGH several distinguished comparative anatomists have done much by their labours
Qto elucidate the general organization of the Annelids, the reproductive system of organs
Zin this class has been little, if at all, investigated. On this account the author of this
= memoir is tempted to lay before the Royal Society the results of a systematic series of
Sresearches on this subject, on which he has been, for some years, laboriously occupied.
SThese researches conveniently arrange themselves under two leading divisions.
3 The first will include a merely anatomical description of the chief or typical varieties
5 of form and structure which these organs are found to exhibit in the leading. genera of
=the class; while the second will embrace a brief statement of sach homological views as
Zthe ascertained facts with respect to their structure, form, and anatomical relations may
.D appear to warrant.
S As the organ upon which always, in some part or other of the body of the Annelid,
Ethe office of reproduction devolves, is frequently in other parts diverted to other pur-
& poses, and modified in outward characters, it will prevent circuitousness of expression if
Zat the outset a name be adopted, under which, whatever its place, size or form, this
= organ may be generically distinguished.
5 Under the appellation of the © segmental organ *,” accordingly, it is proposed to de-
= 8cribe that viscus upon the basis of which, under several striking variations of place and
S figure, are always ingrafted the true generative structures. By way of a general historical
= introduction, the author will content himself with the following citation from the recently
5 published lecturesF of Mr. HuxLey, exhibiting the state of knowledge on this subject
at the date of its publication, July 23, 1856. © The genitalia of the typical Annelida
