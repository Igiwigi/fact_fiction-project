“3 _We have next to meet the question as to the geological age of the cranium which
2 forms the subject of the present inquiry.
% From Mr. Last’s correspondence it appears that the bones from the marsh of
= Amboulisatra were found lying between a stratum of a “white clayey substance”
© above, and a deposit of “greenish sand and stones” below. The white clay has a

3 adhering to the bones is in fact a green quartzitic sand. They have a very fresh
- appearance, and in their mode of preservation and colouring much resemble the
animal remains from lake-dwellings, some of them having an even fresher
A appearance.

With regard to the remains of Crocodilus robustus from the marsh of Amboulisatra,
it has already been stated that this species is actually existing in the lakes of the
interior.

Aupn, Mune Epwarps and Granprprer, in their paper on the remains of
Aepyornis from this same deposit, sum up in the following words the discussion as to
their age: “Il ressort donc clairement de ces faits que l Aepyornis a vécu a une
