The temperature was then raised to about 80* F., which, after
ome minutes, produced a state of almost complete rest, with the yelk-ball globular, the
lgcus germinativus nipple-shaded, and the oil-drops displaced. At the same time the
'Fitrol ova were vigorously contracting. Being then removed, and left at the tempera-
1Fe of the room, they completed the first cleft at 1" 50" after impregnation, and by
JE 30” after, were cleft into the coarse mulberry stage, and much in advance of the
trol ova; a fact, the more remarkable, because the contractions had been arrested
for a time by the highest temperature used. In this experiment the thermometer was
laid upon the cell, but probably indicated a temperature somewhat higher than that
reached by the eggs. Experiment e.—Ova ten minutes after impregnation, put into a chamber, warmed to
83* F., and kept there for twenty minutes, were found actively contracting.
