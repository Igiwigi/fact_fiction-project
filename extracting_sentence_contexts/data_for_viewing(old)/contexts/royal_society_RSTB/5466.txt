in reptiles and mammals. It seemed impossible to doubt that the organ of JAcoBsoNn
in the lizard is homologous with the organ of Jacopson in Ornithorhynchus, and if this
is so the cartilaginous capsules that support the organs must also be homologous. The
capsules in each have on their inner sides supporting splint bones, and I was forced to
the conclusion that these splint bones must also be homologous. But the splint bones in
Ornithorhynchus unite to form the so-called “ dumb-bell shaped bone,” while the splint
bones in the lizard become the so-called ‘‘ vomers.” As the “ dumb-bell shaped bone ”
in Ornithorhynchus is not the vomer, which is well developed behind it, a new name
became necessary and I proposed the name “ prevomer”’ for it and for the “ vomers”’
of the lizard which I regarded as homologous.

A few years later I endeavoured at greater length to trace out the homologies and in
at least three instances, working with imperfectly known facts, was in error. The
apparently single vomer-like bone in the Chelonians I regarded as a true vomer: I
now regard it as the prevomer. The single median bone in the front of the palate of
Dicynodon I also believed to be a true vomer. Later discoveries revealed that it is a
prevomer, the true vomer lying above it. The vomer-like bone which supports the
secondary palate in the Cynodonts was also regarded as a true vomer. Later facts
revealed good reasons for considering this also as the prevomer.

The study of many skulls of Therocephalians and Gorgonopsians showed beyond doubt
that the apparently single median bone in the front of the palate, lying between the
internal nares, is really a pair of prevomers. In most Therocephalians the bones are
fused, but in some smaller forms (e.g., Ictidognathus hemburyi) the two bones remain
distinct apparently throughout life. In all known Gorgonopsians, even when fairly
