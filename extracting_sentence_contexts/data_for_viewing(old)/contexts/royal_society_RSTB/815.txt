have pointed out, direct stimulation of these nerves causes a rise of pressure in the
pulmonary and systemic arteries, and therefore of the intra-ventricular pressure
during systole, so that the force of the ventricular contractions must be increased.
In curves 14 and 15 it can be seen that the increase in force of the ventricular
contractions does not go hand in hand with the increase in force of the auricular
contractions. This cannot be fully explained by the fact that changes in the arterial
blood-pressure will apparently affect the one without affecting the other, and an
examination of our curves rather points to the conclusion that the degree and dura-
tion of the increase in force which is produced by augmentor action on the auricles
and ventricles respectively, varies with the condition of each of these parts at the
time they are excited. We conclude, then, that direct excitation of the nervi augmen-
tores increases the force of the ventricular contractions, so that they contract more
completely, diminishing the amount of residual blood, in spite of the fact that the
arterial pressure is raised at the same time.

It will be seen, when we come to speak of the effect of reflex excitation of the
augmentores, that this latter differs in some important particulars from that of direct
stimulation. The tracings of Figs. 14, 15, and 16 show that great changes in the
force of the heart’s contractions may take place with little or no accompanying change
in the rate of beat. It is important to keep this in mind, as also that the output of
the heart may be doubled or trebled without any change of the rhythm.
