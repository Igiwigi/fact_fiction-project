Then if 8, #, 9 are the parameters of the angles, we have
ITW—TIY =2IL ,
I —IVW=207,

Iv —I1 =2017,
and thence
I-+I#+T=0
as the relation which must subsist between the parameters &, #, #, of the conics touched

by the sides; and 8imilarly for a polygon of » sides, the relation between the para -
meters is

Ilk+I0k,+...+I0k,=0.

But by ABEL's theorem, this transcendental equation is equivalent to an algebraical
= fact, calling the radical y az, then if px, x are rational and integral functions
of x with arbitrary coefficients, and if
gr—paroe=Aa—kNa—k)...(0—k,),

(this implies that @*z is of a degree not exceeding 7 and xx of a degree not exceeding
1n—3; that is, for » even the degrees of @x, x7 are 3, 3(n—4); and for n odd they are
1(n—1), 3(n—3)), then the algebraical equation is that obtained by the elimination of
the arbitrary coefficients from the system of equations

gh +. Ok=0,

gh, +xk,0k,=0;
or, what is the same thing, for » odd =2p—1, it is
{1, 0, ... &”, Ds, 0/08, ..#4* A} =0,
and for » even, =2p, it is
{1, 0, ... 8, /DQ8, Od, ..42y D=0,

where the expressions in { } denote respectively the determinants, of 2p—1 lines, and
. 2p lines, formed by substituting for 0 the values k,, k,, ... &, respectively. Thus for n=3,

the equation is
1, kh, MT Ok, =0;

and for n=4, it is

and $0 on.
_- v DE=A+BE+CP+DP+EEF+...;
then substituting the corresponding expressions for 4 On, I Oh, &c., the determinant
will divide by {1, 0, ®, .. 08}, and it may be seen without difficulty that the resulting
equation on putting therein þ,=k,... =k,=0, will, according as n=3, 4, 5, 6, &c., be
