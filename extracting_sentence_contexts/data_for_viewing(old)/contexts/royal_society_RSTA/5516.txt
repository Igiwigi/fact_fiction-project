The application layer of the platform SIMPLE provides a set of pre-defined (i.e. aligned to the
PPR data model) data processing and analytics functions, as well as the corresponding production
monitoring dashboards, to support common manufacturing requirements and use cases: e.g.
monitoring and predictive analysis of production-related data such as process performances,
quality, product traceability and maintenance-related information. Various software modules
support the deployment configuration, maintenance and general administration of the platform’s
components.

6. Optimization

Many research projects and industrial companies are working towards the realization of Industry
4.0 and the self-organizing factory. In this context, several leading academics have recently
commented on the fact that the real core concept of Industry 4.0 is related to optimization, as
discussed in §1. Once the necessary connectivity has been realized to enable the collection of
good quality data capable of forming the basis of actionable insights derived from the multitude
of devices, the challenge is dynamically optimizing production through both local and global
adaptations.

Decision support and optimization of manufacturing processes in real-time are demanding
tasks. Simulation-based offline optimization techniques are increasingly used in industry today
to perform what-if analysis based on foresight of possible disruptions/changes on shop floors.
However, such an approach only partially improves system performance. There is a need for a
real-time dynamic optimization approach that couples simulation models with machine-learning
and optimization algorithms.
