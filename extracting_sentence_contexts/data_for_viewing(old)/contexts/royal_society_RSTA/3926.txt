8. Heavily and lightly regulated sectors

In some sectors, the use of analytics has become very highly regulated, for competition, safety,
security and inclusivity reasons, and operators are subject to a process that is overseen by
government, generally to protect the citizens.

One such appears to be the development of new drugs by pharmaceutical companies [41], [3
with the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry estimating that it costs on average : =
£1.2bn to bring a new drug to market, and takes 12 years. This involves pre-discovery, actual : 5
discovery, pre-clinical trials, phases 1, 2 and 3 of clinical trials and licensing stages. Almost all D3
of these involve some data analysis. In many ways, this whole pipeline is broken by bearing : =
such costs, or through the pricing of drugs that NICE will not afford. So in fact the present : =
process, imposed prior to licensing to protect citizens, is suffocating the industry and thereby :
putting citizens at risk. A creative way out of this is to have some pooling of information, sharing 8
of targets at early stages and this supported by public money alongside of multiple small and 7s
large corporations’ investment, with only later stages becoming protected and competitive, see 18

the ‘Bioescalator’ concept in [42], for example.

About 10 years ago the UK financial sector became acutely aware that the high degree of
regulation had created barriers to new entrants to the retail banking sector. In essence, this
suppressed innovation and reduced choice for customers (at a time when the banking crisis
pointed to many manifest failures of the incumbents). Yet the most powerful tool regulators have
at their disposal is the ability to stimulate competition. New entrant, digital, banks challenge the
