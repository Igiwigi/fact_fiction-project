(p. 230) that “in the spontaneous beat of the excised organ the contraction of the
apex generally appears to precede that of the base.” Out of 25 observations,* in
17 the mechanical effect of contraction manifested itself at the apex first, in 2 at the
base first, in 6 there was no appreciable difference. Taken by themselves, these
observations went to show that the contraction of the Mammalian heart normally
commences at the apex. But the electrical observations by which we sought to
confirm this testimony obtained by the mechanical method failed entirely and obliged
us to statet “that, as regards the electromotive changes with visible spontaneous
beats, our results show no uniformity ; we can find in them no evidence either for or
against the results we obtained by the graphic method.” Observation of the electrical
variation of the heart beating in situ shows it to be, in the majority of cases examined
(11 out of 17), composed of (1) negativity of apex, (2) negativity of base; having
regard to the fact that the organ is unstable and dying, we may expect to meet with
exceptions to the rule, which, although by no means invariable, has been frequently
enough verified to allow us to say of the Mammalian ventricle “apex first” with
nearly as much certainty as we say of the Frog’s heart “base first.” As will be
shown in Part II., the electrical phenomena of the Human heart afford strong con-
firmation of this view.

T must admit, however, that these observations on the exposed organ in situ have
been the most troublesome and unsatisfactory in respect of their irregularities ; six
exceptions as compared with eleven “regular” results is a considerable proportion,
and I have, therefore, sought by further observations to realise the effect of modifying
circumstances, and the possible sources of irregularities. I will deal with these points
servatum.
