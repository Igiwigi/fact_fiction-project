A shallow glass vessel contain-
ing barytic water had been placed under the same receiver, but the transparency of
this was not affected. Hydrogen was then transmitted into the receiver, and the
bladder was reduced to the same size as when first snspended under it ; but, after an
interyal of four hours, it had hecome perfectly flaceid. In fact, there was scarcely a
particle of carbonic acid left in it, and the barytic water within the receiver contained
a quantity of carbonate of baryta. 6. The double-necked bottle was carefully filled with pure hydrogen, and about
five ounces of blood were drawn into it from a vein in the arm, in the same manner
as in experiment 3.
