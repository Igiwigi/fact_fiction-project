A similar phenomenon has been described by Tamman (1926) in non-
polymeric crystallizing systems. Above 230° G there is no difference in the temperature
of the bath medium and the crystallizing sample. A similar plateau is not observed at
temperatures around 130° C, where the rates of crystallization are of the same order;
this is of course due to the fact that elevation of temperatures in this range will result in an
enhanced rate of crystallization.

Ficure 4. Effect of temperature of fusion on rates of crystallization of polyethylene terephthalate
([y] =65) at 108 and 234-5° C. At the end of the crystallization there is almost invariably a slow apparently linear
increase in the density of the crystallized sample if it is retained for a prolonged time at
the temperature at which it was crystallized.
