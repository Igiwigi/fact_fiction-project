take.

The slightest touch applied to one of the spines of the hedgehog immediately
rouses it to draw that deep inspiration of which I have spoken. The merest
shake induces a few respirations in the bat. The least disturbance, in fact, is
felt, as is obvious from its effect in inducing motion in the animal.

It is from the misconception on this point that the error has arisen, that the
respiration is not absolutely suspended in hybernation. This function has been
80 readily excited, through the medium of an unimpaired sensibility, that the
event has been considered as appertaining to the state of hybernation.

In fact, the sensibility is in nearly the same condition in hybernation as in
ordinary sleep.

It must appear extraordinary that with an unimpaired sensibility there can
co-exist a suspended respiration. Why is not this snspension of respiration
painful in the hybernating, as in other animals? And why is not the animal
roused, by this pain, from its slumbers, if its sensibility be only slightly im-
paired ?

But we $hould first ask, what are the precise seat and source of that pain
which is felt during the suspension of respiration ? These are, I think, demon-
strably, the heart, and an impeded circulation through this organ. If, there-
