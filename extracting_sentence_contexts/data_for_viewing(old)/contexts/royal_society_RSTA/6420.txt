than explained.

For Darwin life was ‘breathed in’ to dead matter by the Creator [19]. More recently, assuming
a vast amount of time, e.g. 1-2 GY, thought to have elapsed before an ‘origin event’ took place, it
was said to have occurred with an infinitely improbable accident ‘that only had to happen once’
[5]. But recent paleobiological discoveries have defeated this account showing life emerged not
after some long time, but opportunistically almost immediately as soon as the Earth had cooled
enough after its formation to keep the oceans from evaporating, and opportunistic ordering
continued from there, e.g. multicellular eukaryotes as soon as there was enough oxygen (O2)
in the atmosphere to support them, and larger forms as soon as QO? levels increased further
(figure 2) [21].

Beyond the fact that Darwinism cannot explain the very nature of life, the active, end-directed
striving to fill out the economy of nature, there is a cascade of related problems that follows
from its bracketing off from physics and briefly noted here (for more detail see [3-5,8,20]). The
first is the ‘problem of the population of one’ [5,21], the origin problem just discussed being a
special case. The name comes from the instance of planetary evolution. During the latter half of
the last century, it became clear that the Earth at the highest level has evolved as a single global
entity [3,5,21], the immediate prima facie evidence for this being the creation and maintenance of
planetary atmospheric O2 on which all higher ordered living forms depend, and put there by life
itself (figure 3). Evolution with this had become a coherent planetary process with all other forms
of life as component productions, and the fundamental unit of terrestrial evolution now had to be
seen as the planetary system itself.
