ing to a certain decrement or increment of temperature at all
temperatures. To determine this accurately, would however
require a great variety of experiments to be made with
magnets of very different intensities ; but as I have not made
these, I must- content myself for the present with pointing
out some of the facts-which I have ascertained from more
extended experiments than those I have already given, re-
serving the detail of these experiments for another oppor-
tunity, should they be deemed of sufficient interest.

These experiments were made with a balance of torsion,
the needle being 'suspended by a brass wire 4; inch in
diameter : by them I ascertained the following facts :

1. Commencing with a temperature â€” 9? FAHRENHEIT, up
to a temperature 127?, as the temperature of the magnets
increased, their intensity decreased. Owing to the almost
total absence of snow during the winter, I was unable to re-
duce lower the temperature of the large magnets which I
made use of; but from an experiment I made at the Royal
Institution, in conjunction with Mr. Farapay, in which a
small magnet, enveloped in lint well moistened with sul-
phuret of carbon, was placed on the edges of a basin con-
taining sulphuric acid, under the receiver of an air pump, I
found that the intensity of the magnet increased to the lowest
