available in operational time scales will escalate at all levels due to technologies such as smart
meters—at the consumer level—and phasor measurement units [19]—at both transmission and
distribution network levels—which will allow operators to significantly improve their visibility
and thus state estimation of the system. With a clearer picture of system conditions in real
time through increased volumes of data and with a higher level of controllability of network
equipment, operators will thus be able to run the system in a more secure fashion, using network
infrastructure at higher levels (ie. with less redundancy and less congestion) and therefore
improving the overall economic performance of the system operation activity as well as deferring
the need for conventional electricity infrastructure investment.

In addition, there is an increasing need to capture coordination actions across various energy
vectors, including all electricity sectors (from local energy management systems, distribution and
transmission networks to generation), gas, heat/cooling and transport [12]. In fact, flexibility from
electricity demand can be coupled with heat and/or mobility needs from consumers, and this may
have important impacts on electricity network operation and investment beyond distribution
networks, affecting also the transmission and generation infrastructure. For example, flexible
demand from electric vehicles (i.e. battery charging /discharging actions) or heat pumps [11] can
be controlled so as to reduce electricity demand during peak hours, provide frequency control
services, provide congestion management services (in distribution and transmission networks),

Building a 1000 MW line in anticipation of connection requirements is likely to be more efficient than building 10 lines of
100 MW as a result of 10 different connection requirements at different points in time, albeit there is a risk associated with the
potential stranded network infrastructure if generation projects do not materialize as anticipated.
