SHOENBERG ON THE

difference between exponential and sinh (see (5) and (1)) appreciable, and the logarithmic
plot ceases to be linear. As will be explained in the detailed discussion later (see p. 15) this
situation can be dealt with by a process of successive approximations. Another consequence
of a sufficiently small value of 272k 7/fH is the presence of harmonic components, and we
shall see that these have in fact been detected experimentally in gallium and graphite. The next comparison with theory is as regards the field variation of the amplitude of the
oscillations; it is appropriate to plot log aH! against 1/H. The slope of the straight line gives
2n°k( T-+-x)/f, and, knowing the value of f from the temperature variation, « can be deduced.
