‘3 In 1886 the greatest value registered for the total light was 0°02 of the same unit,

2 but in connection with this low estimate it is pointed out that the conditions of

2 observation were not so favourable as in 1878.[ Photometric observations were

S made in 1893, but the results have not yet been published.

£ Thus, the greatest brightness of the total light was recorded at a sun-spot

g maximum, while the light was very much less near the times of minima.

£ So far as they go, these facts agree with the view that the true corona is brightest

3B near a sun-spot maximum,

S The more solar physics is studied, the more an enormous change from maximum to

s minimum in all the phenomena is revealed. Besides this variability of the corona

© there is, in addition to the well-known eleven-yearly variation in the number of spots,
facule, and prominences, a variation in the spectra of sun spots so marked, as I have
shown in other communications, that there are few, if any, widened lines common to
the maximum and minimum,
