This is at variance
with another observation of DzsmaresT, quoted by M. Araco, that © when, in conse-
quence of a cloudy sky, the atmospherical temperature experiences little yariation
throughout the day and night, the ice at the bottom of the water uniformly increases
every twenty-four hours ; on the contrary, when the s8un shows itself, the ice docs
not increase during the day.” It is the fact, that while it is forming under the con-
tinuance of a cloudless sky, its increase is impeded during the day, It may be pos-
8ble, amidst the infinite variety of measures of cold that may exist at the time, that
the increase of the gru may go on for a little time after the sun has been obscured
by a thin cloud ; but I have always seen, that when a densely clouded state of the
sky superyened, and continued for the space of even only twenty-four hours, the gru
became detached from the bottom, and floated down the stream. Should the tem-
perature of the air continue low, with the clouded sky, or get lower, the ground-gru
is not renewed, but the river is speedily frozen over at the surface, It is, in fact, a
matter of frequent occurrence, in frosty winters, that our rivers, filled, and 80 im-
peded, by ground-gru, as to be raised above their banks, are found returned into
their natural channels, and there frozen over at the surface, but flowing over a clear
bottom, in a space of time 80 short as to appear very wonderful to those who have
not investigated the cause. The process is named, by the country people, the fitting
of the ice. In opposition to the observation of DesMaresT, and in confirmation of
those which I have made, on this point, I may refer to the Rev. Mr. Ers8paLe, who,
not satisfied with the explanations of M. Araco, has published one of his own, in the
Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal, vol. xvii.
