Why is magnetized plasma turbulence anisotropic? This question can be answered rather
simply, in the context of incompressible MHD, through physical intuition derived from the
picture of nonlinear energy transfer presented above. Basically, the anisotropy arises as a direct
consequence of two facts: (i) only counter-propagating Alfvén waves interact nonlinearly and
(ii) the nonlinear energy transfer is maximized for interactions between perpendicularly polarized
Alfvén waves. Consider the nonlinear interaction between two plane Alfvén waves with arbitrary
wavevectors kj and kz. We adopt the convention that the wave frequency must be non-negative,
w= 0, so that the propagation direction of the wave along the mean magnetic field is given by
the sign of the parallel component of the wavevector.
