ganglion-cell (figs. 10, 17, 18, 22, & 23).

Figs. 4, 27, & 28, on the other hand, show fully formed ganglion-cells which are
imbedded in a tissue exhibiting striations, and a few fine fibres which resist the action
of acetic acid. Around and at a short distance from the ganglion-cells there are several
oval nuclei (connective-tissue corpuscles).

Figs. 4, 27, & 28 exhibit the characters of old ganglion-cells. 'The fibrous appearance
of the matrix is more distinct, the fibres which resist the action of acetic acid are more
numerous, and there are more nuclei around the ganglion-cell and around the fibres
proceeding from it, but these nuclei are not connected with either.

And the important fact that the s0-called connective-tissue corpuscles outside the
ganglion-cells and outside the nerve-fibres are but faintly coloured with carmine, while
those nuclei in connexion with the ganglion-cell and nerve-fibres, although separated
from the solution by a greater distance, are more intensely coloured, must not be lost
8ight of. This was very, distinct in the specimen represented in figs. 27 & 28.

Before any attempt is made to explain these facts, it is necessary to consider more
particularly the relation. of nerve-fibres and nerve-cells to the connective tisxue and con-
nective-tissne corpuscles. Although it is undoubtedly true that in preparations mounted
in. certain fluids it is not possible to distinguish the finest nerve-fibres from connective
tissue, this distinction can be most clearly made out in some of my specimens; for ex-
ample, in figs. 17 & 18 the nerve-fibre can be very readily distinguished as it runs amongst
the connective tissue, and the true. nature of the fibre is placed beyond question by the
