acid test was obtained with five authentic cultures of Aspergillus nidulans—one
obtained from Baarn, one from PrrpRAM, two from Miss CraurcH, and one
isolated in this laboratory and identified by Miss Cuurcu. If, therefore, the
authenticity of Yasura’s cultures is accepted, the most probable explanation of the
discrepancies in our findings seems to be that Yasura cultivated his fungi on a different
medium and under different conditions from ours. For this reason it cannot, in our
opinion, be too strongly stated that, if the test is to have any diagnostic value, it must
be carried out exactly as described.

Fortunately there seems to be enough internal evidence in TRanrra-Mosca’s paper
(1914) to explain his statement that his compound C,H,0,, which is almost certainly
kojic acid, is produced by Aspergillus glaucus. This is contradictory, not only to our
findings, but to those of Yasura, and is to be explained by the fact that, in our opinion,
Trarrra-Mosca’s culture was not Aspergillus glaucus, but a member of the A. flavus-

oryze group. This opinion is based on the following facts :—

(1) Trawrra-Mosca states that his culture gives rise to ethyl alcohol in addition to
kojic acid. The quantitative experiments described in Part III prove definitely
that no alcohol is produced by any member of the A. glaucus group, but is
given in quantity by all the members of the A. flavus-oryz@ group tested.

(2) Trawrra-Mosca cultivated his organism at 37° C. None of our cultures of the
A, glaucus group will grow at all at 37° C., while all our cultures of the A. flavus:
oryze group grow well at this temperature.
