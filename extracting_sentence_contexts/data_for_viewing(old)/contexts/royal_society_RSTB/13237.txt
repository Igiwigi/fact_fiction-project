[23,24]. Their intrinsic survival advantage even depends
on reproductive activation [25] and complements the effects
of their protected environment and social facilitation of
longevity [15].

The life-extending effect of reproductive activation in
social insects is further supported by comparisons of non-
reproductive and reproductive workers. In many species,
the worker caste is functionally sterile but workers can acti-
vate their ovaries when not inhibited by the presence of
queens and/or brood [26]. Reproductive workers signifi-
cantly outlive their non-reproductive nest-mates [27,28].
This longevity advantage may be owing to the fact that the
reproductive workers represent a non-random sample of
the general worker population [13] or be related directly to
reproductive activation and hence the differences between
queen and normal worker physiology. Reproductive
activation may be necessary for the longevity of social
insect queens [25], and reproductively activated workers
thus represent a good model to investigate the proximate fac-
tors of the extended lifespan of social insect queens without
the confounding effects of alternative developmental path-
ways and other differences between castes [29]. However,
such studies have so far only yielded limited mechanistic
insights [30].
