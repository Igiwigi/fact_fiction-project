Travel restrictions introduced in March 2020 may have limited the number of lineages of the
virus in Ukraine [27]. Another study found that most of the lineages that later dominated the Delta
variant wave had been introduced into the UK prior to the implementation of hotel quarantine
for incoming travellers [28]. Targeted travel restrictions against travellers from southern African
countries were largely ineffective at reducing the number of lineages of the Omicron variant in
the UK, owing to the fact that many lineages had already been imported by the time the measures
were put into place and because the USA quickly became an important source of introductions
and travellers from there were not subject to any form of control measure at the time [29]. There was also limited evaluation of the impact of border control measures on equity or other
considerations, which is another important limitation of the existing literature. Border control measures can be among the most economically costly of the COVID-19 control
measures adopted during the pandemic.
