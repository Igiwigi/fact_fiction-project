In the case of the latter factor, we may rearrange and
obtain the dispersion relation

Note that for a general Lorentz material (6.3) still has non-zero real and imaginary parts, due
to the presence of e,. Therefore, the discussion of §5b is still applicable here, although it is now
possible to rearrange and obtain y as a function of w and k. One can also obtain results concerning homogeneous dielectric systems with classical
Leontovich boundary conditions from the more general system presented in §5, using the fact
that the dispersion relation collapses to (6.3). In the regime of bounded k/w and with |¢,| > 1, the
dispersion relation (6.3) reduces, to leading order, to the relation obtained in [5, eqn 9]:

V(eata/éoro) A = (Homi /e0eL)(ea/Ha))

7. Conclusion

In our analysis of the full-space problem, we have demonstrated the possibility to obtain a
dispersion relation as in (5.1) that in general has non-trivial expressions for the real and imaginary
parts, thereby providing only finitely many points (w,k) that support surface waves for each
value of the loss parameter y.
