charge whose size matched that of the atom [37-39]. Rutherford’s scattering theory required that
the scattering power should be proportional to the square of the charge on the atomic nucleus.
Accordingly Geiger and Marsden performed a second set of experiments where they measured
«-particle backscattering from a series of different elemental foils ranging from carbon to gold
[40]. The consensus view in Manchester at the time was that the nuclear charge was half the


atomic weight A, and Geiger and Marsden therefore analysed their scattering data by dividing
the scattering power per atom N by A2, expecting to find a constant. The values of N/A? were in
fact far from constant. This was put down to experimental error, although there were hints that
N/A? decreased with increasing atomic weight [40].

The concept that the order number of an element in the periodic table in fact determined the
nuclear charge first emerged from a re-analysis of the Geiger-Marsden scattering data performed
by Antonius van den Broek [41]. Van den Broek was an obscure Dutch lawyer and econometrician,
who had over the years developed his own ideas as how to best organize the periodic table, but
who remained out of the scientific mainstream [42]. The key papers introducing the idea of atomic
number focused on scattering data for Cu, Ag, Sn, Pt and Au that had been measured using both
‘Radium C’ (the bismuth isotope oi Bi) and ‘Radium Emanation’ (the radon isotope 222Rn) as the
sources for the «-particles. The order numbers for the heavier elements (and in some cases the
atomic weights) were far from certain, but recognizing that the atomic weight for most heavier
elements is just over twice the order number M, he analysed the scattering data by dividing the
scattering power by M? x 5.4 (,/5.4= 2.32) and argued that this gave much less scatter than using
A? [41].
