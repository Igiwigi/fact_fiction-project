Diagram of transverse section of apex about 7 days after operation. The sides of
the wound have gaped apart; the wound meristem is shown by lines radiating inwards from the
wound,

since the two sides must have gaped apart some time before. The very small relative
size of the wound scar in these sections was obviously due to the fact that its absolute
size remained the same while the surrounding tissues went on growing. In two or three
experiments, for instance No. 5, fig. 5, D, the wound was seen to project on a protuber-
ance, which may have been formed by the activity of the wound meristem.

(4) Terminology and Brief Classification of Results. The primordia will be named in the same way as before.
