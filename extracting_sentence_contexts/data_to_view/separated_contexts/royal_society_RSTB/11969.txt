These clearly count as full natural languages as they
fulfil the three obligatory domains of any natural language:
semantics, syntax and even phonology. A detailed descrip-
tion of the sign language system can be found in Sandler &
Lillo-Martin [2]. Second, the fact that non-human primates
do not speak is not dependent on an inability to produce
the sounds comprising the vowels and consonants in natural
spoken language. In fact, it has been shown that the articula-
tory space in non-human primates is similar to that of
humans [3]. Third, the fact that non-human primates do not
produce or comprehend language does not necessarily
mean they are incapable of learning words or meaningful
sound patterns.
