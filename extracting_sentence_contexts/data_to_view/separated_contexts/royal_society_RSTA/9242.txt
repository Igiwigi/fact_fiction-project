One direction in which this result can be amplified is by extending the assumption
Swe have made that the matrix Q,"(w) has linear invariant factors. It is well enough
understood what is the character of the modifications thereby introduced. A more
important generalisation appears to be that the factorisation of the matrix Q(u)
‘odoes not in fact require that u be a periodic matrix. As an indication of the theorem

consider an equation

~ ax

+o°x = x (ae™+be™ +ce™),

“An which the constants x, A, « are such that «+A+ = 0, but the ratio of two of them
‘Sat least is irrational. For example, we might have «= /2+1, w= —\/2+1,
= —2.
