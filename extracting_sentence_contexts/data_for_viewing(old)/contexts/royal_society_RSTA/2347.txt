general frequency—the ‘22’ component of £°—is not just non-local; it is also a second-order
tensor. This was demonstrated by Willis [27] by considering a simple explicit example. This
was a composite with two components. Both components had the same isotropic elastic moduli
but different densities, and the two-point correlation function h was taken to be h(x) = e/a,
Because the elastic constants are the same throughout the composite, (0) = (Le) = L(e), and the
only non-trivial effective relation is (p) = (pv) = p(v). The effective operator pf isa spatial
convolution operator, which Fourier transformation reduces to a second-order isotropic tensor-
valued function of the wavenumber vector &. If the inverse time parameter s is taken real and
po = min(p1, 2), the variational structure provides a lower bound for the quadratic form defined
by pt, and hence lower bounds for the eigenvalues of the transform of pet for each &, and
corresponding upper bounds if pp = max(p1, 2). The Fourier transform of ptt isa transversely
isotropic tensor and so has two distinct eigenvalues which are isotropic functions of § and
hence functions of |£|, which would coincide if p* were in fact a scalar operator. Willis [27]
demonstrated explicitly that the lower bound of one of the eigenvalues was greater than the upper
bound of the other, at certain values of s and |é|, thereby confirming the tensorial nature of pet,

The coupling displayed in the dynamical effective relations, between stress and velocity as well
as strain, and between momentum density and strain as well as velocity, essentially lay dormant
for many years, receiving no attention at all except for being highlighted in a course of lectures on
the dynamics of composites at the International Centre for Mechanical Sciences [28]. The coupling
was demonstrated in those lectures by showing that it appeared unavoidably in a perturbation
expansion for effective (i.e. ensemble averaged) stress and momentum density versus strain and
velocity, in a medium with small-amplitude heterogeneity.
