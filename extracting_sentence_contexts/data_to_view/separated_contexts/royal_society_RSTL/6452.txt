The spectrum of carbon is a very beautiful one. The lines composing each band of
light regularly diminish in brightness in the direction of greatest refraction, and appear
to retreat from the observer like pillars of a portico seen in perspective. Tt differs
greatly from that of eyery other element that I am acquainted with; and though, in
each of the experiments described, it was of course accompanied by the spectrum of
either nitrogen, hydrogen, suIphur, or oxygen, its diagnosis was not thereby interfered
with; it is, in fact, most widely different from, and cannot possibly be confounded with,
either of them. The brightest band of the carbon spectrum being blue, and its other constituents
being on the one hand light green and on the other violet, the associated rays of ignited
carbon vapour, as indeed seen by the naked eye in carbon flames, I conceive to be of a
light-blue colour. The tint may be observed in the flame of a spirit-lamp, in a burning
jet of carbonic oxide, in the blowpipe flame of any hydrocarbon, and at the base of a
common. candle flame.
