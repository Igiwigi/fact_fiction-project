It includes, too, a greater
range of gradation than the decanaliculate, being in its most exaggerated phase
as pronounced as the extreme stage of asymmetry of an Ewatp frog. Two questions in relation to the de-utriculate asymmetry deserve comment. Firstly, the fact that the unisoliutricular frog exhibits different degrees of the
asymmetry is to be correlated with the difficulty of obtaining regular or consistent
figures, when a merely blinded animal or one with two utricular macule
remaining is subjected to slow lateral tilt. Evidently the otolith of the unisoli-
* utricular frog may attain stability at different degrees of inclination of its underlying
macula. Secondly, the fact that the usual degree of spinal torque of the present is
less than that of an Ewatp frog is to be correlated with the presence of vertical
canals in the intact labyrinth of the latter animal.
