With regard to the differential
equation there is clearly no worry, but the boundary condition presents great technical
difficulties. The difficulty can be seen with reference to figure 7, in which it is required to establish
finite-difference equations at points adjacent to the curved boundary, and to satisfy a boun-
dary condition involving a normal derivative. The differential equation at the point 0
involves the fictitious points 1 and 2, and expressions for the values at these points must
therefore be obtained in terms of internal points and the given boundary conditions. There
are two obvious possibilities, neither of which is completely satisfactory. FicureE 7

First, normals can be drawn from the fictitious points (Fox 1944) and the boundary con-
dition satisfied at the points where these normals cut the boundary.
