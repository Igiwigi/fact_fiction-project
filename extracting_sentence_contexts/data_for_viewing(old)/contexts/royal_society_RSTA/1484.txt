iterative computations; designing iterative algorithms based on general assumptions about the
numerical properties and structure of the data, or the statistical distribution of the data, is an
effort that does not help in solving particular problems.

As we have seen throughout this article, ‘the data’ cannot be reduced to something as simple
as the matrix condition number. For CG, the nonlinear adaptation to the data is the main principle


behind the method; this is the beauty of Krylov subspace methods. This was appreciated early on
by Lanczos and Einstein, who corresponded on the topic of the Lanczos method [4]:7

The reason why I am strongly drawn to such approximation mathematics problems is
not the practical applicability of the solution, but rather the fact that a very ‘economical’
solution is possible only when it is very ‘adequate’. To obtain a solution in very few steps
means nearly always that one has found a way that does justice to the inner nature of the
problem.

— Cornelius Lanczos in a letter to Albert Einstein on 9 March 1947

Your remark on the importance of adapted approximation methods makes very good
sense to me, and I am convinced that this is a fruitful mathematical aspect, and not just
a utilitarian one.

— Einstein’s reply to Lanczos on 18 March 1947
