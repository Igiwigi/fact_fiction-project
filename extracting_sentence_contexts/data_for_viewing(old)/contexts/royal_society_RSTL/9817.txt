animal against some side of the tank, when the uninjured rows of ambulacral feet
immediately adhere to the gurface and rotate the animal upwards or horizontally,
until it attains the normal position. But if care be taken to prevent contact with
any 8ide of the tank, the mutilated Echinus will remain propped on its equator for
days; it never adopts the simple expedient of reversing the action of its mutilated
feet-rows, 80 as to bring the globe again upon its ab-oral pole and get its unmutilated
feet-rows into action. At first 8ight, therefore, this result seems to point to the con-
clusion that the righting movements are of a merely serial kind ; it seems to indicate
that the feet are only able to act in one direction, from ab-oral to oral pole, and that
there is not sufficient central co-ordination -to induce them to act in the opposite
direction, when it is found to be useless, from the interruption of the series, to con-
tinue the manceuvre in the ordinary direction. But a little closer thought will how
that this conclusion is nob justified by the facts. For even if we assume that the
righting movements of the feet are entirely due to some central co-ordinating
influence, it does not follow, when the execution of these movements is interrupted
by the highly artificial means of shaving off one-half the feet-rows, that the central
co-ordinating apparatus should be adapted to meet 80 unnatural a state of things.

Suppoze, for instance, that it is an incipient sense of gravity that determines this
central apparatus to work the feet-rows serially, in order to rotate the animal into its
normal position ; it does not follow that, under any cireumstances, the stimulus 8UP-
