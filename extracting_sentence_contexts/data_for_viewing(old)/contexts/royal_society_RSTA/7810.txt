the general asymmetric cross-section should present no greater difficulties than are
met with in the case of uni-axial cross-sections. The chief simplification arises in the
calculation of the associated twist r’ and the co-ordinates of the centre of flexure,
where we have only three moment integrals to compute, one of which is a multiple of
the torsion moment for the cross-section.

12. REMARKS ON THE MEASUREMENT OF TWIST BY EXPERIMENT

Duncan, Ellis and Scruton’s determination (1933, p. 213) of the position of
the centre of flexure rests on the fact that “if a constant flexural load in a
direction at right angles to the axis of symmetry be applied at a number of points in
the section and the twist is measured for each point of application, then the position
of the flexural centre can be found, since the twist is proportional to the distance of the
line of action of the load from that centre’’. The twist is apparently taken as propor-
tional to the difference between deflexions of the leading and trailing edges of the
uni-axial cross-sections examined. Let us examine what is really measured by such a
procedure. The deflexion v for a load W’ at the centre of flexure and any twisting
couple yr’M,, which are together equivalent to the load W’ at some other point on
the axis of symmetry, is given by

v = (W’/EI’) [—4y(l—z) {(x—A)? —y?} 4 Iz? /2 — 23/6] + 1'(x—h) z+ yx—azt+f’,
