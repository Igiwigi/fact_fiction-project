By contrast, any pattern that does not have the selected 2p
should have different phases in the phase-corrected wavelet and thus should average to zero in
(Wg) in the limit of large N. The signal to noise for the selected waves should therefore be much
better in the average phase-corrected wavelet than it is in wavelets from individual profiles. In
fact, we find that the average phase-corrected wavelet can yield a clearer detection of weak waves
than even the averaged wavelet powers. :

In order to illustrate the utility of the average phase-corrected wavelet, it is useful to consider :2
two distinct wavelet powers. First, we define the average wavelet power aay

N
=~ 1 :
E(r,k) = (Wel) = 5 Do Weil? 66 ff
i=1 . This is independent of the individual wavelet phases and so is equivalent to the average value of a]
wavelet powers from the individual profiles E;: DN

N
- 1 I
Eek) = (Wi?) = 5 iP (67) :&
i=1

and is, therefore, similar to the statistics used in [21,22].
