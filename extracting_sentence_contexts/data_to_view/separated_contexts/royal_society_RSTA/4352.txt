124 MR. W. F. SHEPPARD ON THE APPLICATION OF THE THEORY OF

If m values of X were observed, and if the discrepancies were independent, it
would be an even chance that in one case at least the ratio of the discrepancy to the
probable discrepancy would exceed the value given by the above table. As a
matter of fact, the discrepancies are usually correlated ; but, if we bear this in mind,
the table may be used to decide whether the greatest value of the ratio is such as to
negative the hypothesis under consideration. For calculating Qo/V/n, in either class of cases, it will not always be necessary to
express o” in terms of a, B, y,... If the value of X depends solely on the values of
certain frequency-constants, and if s, y, 6,... are the errors in these frequency-
constants, then f(e’, B’, y',...) — f(a, B, y,...) may be written in the form
