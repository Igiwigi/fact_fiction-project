It is only when the orange overlaps with both the red and faded-red partons that the two may exert forces on one
another. (Online version in colour.)

In quantum mechanics, a gauge field can have an influence on a particle even when it is
confined to a region where the actual force vanishes, as famously illustrated by the Aharonovâ€”
Bohm effect [7]. Therefore, it is not as trivial as it might initially seem to prove that classical
expectations from the Basu-Ramalho-Sterman or similar pictures carry over to QCD for other
observables. As in the SIA, SIDIS and Drell-Yan cases discussed earlier, factorization for many
standard processes relies on the fact that the observables are very inclusive, with enough final
state averaging to give the necessary cancellations. If one constructs observables with greater
sensitivity to details, interesting effects can modify or even break classical expectations. One place where that happens is when the effects of a small intrinsic transverse momentum
are studied. (We already encountered one example of this in the discussion of equation (2.2).)
For instance, we might ask how an intrinsic transverse momentum of a bound state quark in a
proton gets influenced if the proton is transversely polarized.
