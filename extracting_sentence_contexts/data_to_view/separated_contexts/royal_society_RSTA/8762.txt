Trthlingborough. The nearest deep boring in fact is at Orton,* about 15 miles
N.N.W. of Irthlingborough. There the Lower Lias was about 620 feet thick, and its
base was reached at —292 O.D., below which were 49 feet of Rheetic and other beds
down to —341 O.D. Then came an igneous rock which was pierced to a depth of
74 feet before the boring was abandoned.
