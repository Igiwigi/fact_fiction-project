As a simple example, take

BE f (yr/ar, Lay ys) + e738? +H),
where f is one-signed for all real x, y1, %, ys; then it will be found that
d (tan- y/x
( 7 yl) “a

= constant,

so any surface of the family y/2 = constant is « surface of section. This example illustrates the fact that
the existence of a surface of section does not imply that the system is “ soluble.” Any periodic trajectory cuts #7 in a finite number of points, and from reasons of
continuity combined with the characteristic property of } it is apparent that for
trajectories which correspond to periodic solutions of any one family F the number of such
intersections is the same. We define the order of a periodic solution as the number of
points in which the corresponding trajectory cuts 47.
