H. LANG ON APOGAMY AND THE DEVELOPMENT

bud developed apogamously, and the absence of normal embryos from the rest of
the culture, render this improbable. Further, the fact that a group of small cells
occupied a similar position further back, on the same prothallus, lends weight to the
view that the division of the ovum had occurred independently of sexual fusion. Besides numerous examples of the apogamous development of a normal sporophyte,
this culture yielded a number of prothalli in which the characters of the two â€”
generations appeared more intimately mixed. Isolated ramenta occurred on the
gametophyte ; in fig. 62 a single ramentum is seen on the under surface of a
prothallus which also bears a bud, In the example represented in fig. 63 two large
ramenta were situated on the anterior margin.
