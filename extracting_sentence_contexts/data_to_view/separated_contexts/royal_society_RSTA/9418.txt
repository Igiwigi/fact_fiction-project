diameter are in fair agreement with the present results, but the interpretation of the
series of observations on the 0°635 cm, lead pipe is difficult as the form of the curve
appears to indicate that the conditions are those of stream-line flow. The only expla-
nation which can be suggested is that the diameter of the pipe was over-estimated by
some 15 per cent., in which case the curve shown through the plotted points would
come into fair agreement with the theoretical curve for stream-line flow. The results
of Stock ALPER’s experiments, which possess additional interest owing to the fact that
the air was under a pressure of about 5 atmospheres, are well in agreement with the
present experiments as regards the 20 cm. pipe and less so in the case of the 15 em.
pipe, but unfortunately the range of velocity is not a large one. In conclusion, a note on the various deductions from theoretical considerations of
the criterion for similarity of motion in fluids may be of interest. In a paper read
before the Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1850, Srokest considered any number of
similar systems composed of similar solids, oscillating in a similar manner in different
