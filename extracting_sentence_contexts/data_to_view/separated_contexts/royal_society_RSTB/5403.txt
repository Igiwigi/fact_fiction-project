Introduction. The justification of the following paper is found in the fact that, notwithstanding
the investigations of Ducts (1834), GecENBAUR (1861, 1862, 1876), GorrrE (1875),
ScHWEGMANN (1884), Hasse (1892), Perer (1895), Gapow (1896), RrpEwoop (1897),
KAPELKIN (1900), SCHAINSLAND (1906), and EMELIANOF (1925), which deal with the
vertebral column in Anura, there still remains a great deal of uncertainty as to formation
of the centrum. We are not certain, first, whether the Anuran centrum is formed from
the dorsal arcualia or has an independent origin ; secondly, whether the intervertebral
body is formed from the dorsal arcualia, or has an independent origin ; thirdly, whether
any change takes place in the developing vertebra as it passes from its cartilaginous
condition to its ossified stage, for none of the above-mentioned workers have traced it
up to its full development in the adult condition; fourthly, how the ninth vertebra,
both in the case of Rana temporaria and Bufo melanostictus comes to have two condyles
to articulate with the urostyle; fifthly, how the first (atlas) vertebra develops, and
what is its relation to the occipital region ; lastly, how the Anuran skull has developed
two condyles for articulation with the first vertebra. The writer desires to acknowledge his indebtedness to Prof.
