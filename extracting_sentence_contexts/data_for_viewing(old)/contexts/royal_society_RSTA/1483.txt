one. Therefore, any statement that links convergence of GMRES solely with the distribution of the
eigenvalues of the system matrix must be justified in relation to these results proved more than
20 years ago. This is in the literature done very rarely.

The clustering argument is often used in combination with the remarkable fact pointed out
in [83] that a certain class of preconditioners leads to preconditioned matrices with a low degree
minimal polynomial. Such preconditioners are very important in practice where they are often
replaced by some more computationally feasible approximations, which can lead instead of a
low degree minimal polynomial to a few tight clusters of eigenvalues. This subtle shift requires
a rigorous analysis. In [83], the authors issue a strong warning that while replacing the low
degree minimal polynomial argument with the argument that the preconditioned matrix has a
few distinct eigenvalues one must include a strong assumption that the preconditioned matrix is
either diagonalizable or the Jordan blocks have small size?

While replacing single eigenvalues by tight clusters one must admit that a rigorous argument is
involved? and the behaviour in practice can depend, as pointed out above in the symmetric case,
on the location of the clusters. Our point is that presenting rigorously assumptions under which
