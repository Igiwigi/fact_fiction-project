OF THE ELECTRICAL ORGAN OF TORPEDO MARMORATA. 345

The — effect observed in extrapolar leading-off is undoubtedly due to the spread of
the current of the response. The experiment is conclusive as showing that a large
response may be evoked which is confined to the led-through tract. There is thus no
propagation of the excitatory state from one plate to another. This most important
fact has its cause in the structure of the organ.

Whatever may be the microscopic characters of the nerve terminations in the plates,
-and the part which they play in the production of the excitatory electromotive
‘change, there is no evidence of any continuity of protoplasm between one plate and
dis neighbours. It appears that each plate is physiologically completely severed from
Bll other plates, In order, therefore, to secure the simultaneous response of a whole
-yolumn, either the nerve trunk supplying the column must be excited or an induction
“ghock must traverse all the septa of the column.
