to support it. My own opinion is that in Calymmatotheca we are dealing with
Sporangia. One point is certain, that in the Lower Coal Measures, where Lyginopterts
Oldhamia (or Sphenopteris Héninghaus:) occurs, Calymmatotheca must be very rare,
as I have not met with a single specimen from that horizon, and in the Middle Coal
Measures, where Sphenopteris Héninghaust is also found, I can only remember of
having seen two specimens, both belonging to the Calymmatotheca astervides
Lesgx. sp.t

Neuropteris heterophylla, BRONGNIARY.

The late Dr. Srur was the first botanist to express any doubt as to Newropteris
being a true Fern,§ and this opinion he based on the fact that no fruiting specimen of
Neuropteris had ever been discovered, and as many other fossil Ferns showed their
fructification on the fronds, had Newropteris possessed an ordinary form of Fern
fructification, ‘in such a common and widely distributed genus surely some trace of it
would have been discovered. Of course there was the possibility of the barren and
fertile fronds being quite dissimilar in appearance, a not uncommon occurrence
amongst carboniferous Ferns.

A few years earlier, Renautr published his Memoir on the genus Myelopteris, in
which he adopted the opinion that the affinities of Myclopteris, some of which were
referable to the Neuwropteridee (Neuropteris and Odontopteris), were with the
Marattiacee.|| This opinion was accepted generally as fixing the place of Newropteris
