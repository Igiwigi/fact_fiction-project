sporangiophores appear to project inwards (though they are really proceeding upwards
and outwards) from each subdivision of the nodal disk. TI have already pointed out
that each bract obviously had one thick midrib especially conspicuous near its base.
In my memoir, speaking of the spores, I stated that © at the first glance we should be
tempted to infer that their exteriors had been spinous ; but I have not been able to
satisfy myself that 8uch has been the case ” (loc. cit. p. 34), But since the above
sentence was penned T have obtained yet finer examples of these spores, some of which are
represented in Plate V. fig. 30, affording proof that long spines projected from their outer
surfaces, the bases of these spines being connected by a coarse network of thickened
ridges, reminding us of the aspect of the macrospores of Selaginella mnaquifolia and
other Lycopodiaceous fruits. The size of my newly discovered pores, including the
length of the spines, is about 0044. In my memoir I stated that it was *0037 ; but the
8mall discrepancy is accounted for by the fact that in the latter the spines were imper-
fectly preserved, hence their remarkable length was not known, and consequently not
included in the measurement#.

I think that the preceding description must satisfy the most incredulous that
this fruit belongs to the same plants as the stems described in the earlier part
of the present memoir}. The two agree exactly in the form and compoxition of
the central, non-exogenous, vascular axis, in possessing a bark of which the inner
portion was composed of delicate cells whilst the outer one consisted of coarse
parenchyma, and in the expansion of the latter at each node into a prosenchymatous
leaf-bearing disk. The identity of the triangular axis forming the centre around
which the exogenous growths were developed in the stems of Asferophyllites with
the entire axis in the fruit is precisely what we should expect. I have pointed out,
