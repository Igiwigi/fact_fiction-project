Fast forward 118 years: proof theory? is now a well-established mathematical discipline.
However, Hilbert’s original problem, as formulated in his notebook, is still a mystery. We have
no criteria for ‘simplicity’ of a proof. We have no methods to compare proofs, in fact, we do not
even know when two proofs are the same.? In that respect, proof theory is very different from most
other mathematical fields which usually can identify the objects of their interest. For example, in
group theory, two groups are the same if they are isomorphic, and in topology, two spaces are the
same if they are homeomorphic.

This is clearly embarrassing for proof theory as a mathematical field; and only a satisfactory
notion of proof identity can eventually lead to a satisfactory answer to Hilbert’s 24th problem.
Furthermore, the lack of understanding of what actually constitutes a mathematical proof has
consequences for many other areas in which proof theory is applied, in particular, the foundations
of computer science. In fact, the problem of proof identity is no longer some abstract ‘ivory tower
problem’, but it has serious implications for our daily life, as I will argue below.

(b) The relevance for computer science

Many aspects of our modern life depend on computer systems, and the correct functioning of
the software running on them should be of utmost importance. Yet we do not trust software
and expect it to break, we are used to turning off and back on again our personal computers
if they show unexpected behaviour, and we just shrug at news about the latest ‘software bug’
that has been exploited by criminals or has caused some major damage. A few decades ago
such a ‘computer bug’ might have just been a little annoyance, and even today, a crash of a
word processor or a media player is not a life-threatening problem. But now essentially the
same devices that run our email-client are built into cars, aeroplanes, hospital equipment, nuclear
