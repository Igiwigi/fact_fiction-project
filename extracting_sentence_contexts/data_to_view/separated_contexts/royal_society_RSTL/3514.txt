6. A susceptibility to the action of light, and a power of destroying at any given
moment all susceptibility to further action in the ground of a picture, being granted,
it obviously depends only on the degree of that susceptibility, and on the precision
with which the rays of light can be concentered on or confined to their intended
points of action, how far the photographic impression obtained, whether from the ca-
mera or the original drawing or engraving to be copied, hall satisfy the wishes of
the artist. As regards the camera; that which I employed was neither periscopic
nor achromatic, being in fact no other than the aplanatic crown-glass lens computed
and described in paragraph 13 of my paper on the aberrations of lenses, This com-
bination, though admirable for its original purpose as a burning-glass, is in fact one
of the worst possible for a photographic camera, in which the three qualities of a flat
field, a sharp focus at great inclinations of the visual ray, and a perfect achromaticity,
are indispensable. The latter quality, indeed, (as will be apparent enough from the
properties about to be described,) is eyen more necessary for the photographic than
for the ordinary use of the camera. In consequence, my first camera pictures were
necessarily extremely defective.
