other forms of nonlinearity in the dynamics, nonlinear
damping is the dominant source of nonlinearity in
a number of practical systems. The analysis of such
Accepted: 3 May 2015 systems is simplified by the fact that they show no
jump or bifurcation behaviour, and indeed can often
be well represented by an equivalent linear system,
whose damping parameters depend on the form and
amplitude of the excitation, in a ‘quasi-linear’ model.
The diverse sources of nonlinear damping are first
