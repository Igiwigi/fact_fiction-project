Mr. Cuzxevis's Observations and Experiments, &. 19x

we find a summary of the experiments that had preceded the
impression of his work, together with the following sentence,
« Tous les muriates-Suroxygents sont decomposes par les acides,
« gouvent avec une violente decrepitation, avec une degagement
«© de yapeur jaune verddtre, et une odeur tres-forte, 'Cette yapeur
« est de veritable acide muriatique suroxygens. Elle est lourde,
« tombe en goutellettes Mun jaune vert, et forme des stries
*« comme de Vhuile, sur les corps auxquels elle adhere.” This
assertion carries no confirmation along with it; and does not
amount 80 near to proof as the position of the former chemist :
80 that, in fact, the existence of hyperoxygenized muriatic acid,
and of its combination with potash, rests, at present, upon the
conjecture/of Mr. BERTHOLLET; 'a conjecture however which,
as well as his'whole dissertation upon the subject, bears all the
marks of genius which so strongly characterise every produc-
tion of that sagacious philosopher. Some notice has been taken
of other saline combinations, formed by causing a current of
oxygenized muriatic acid to pass through solutions of the alkalis,
or earths, or by otherwise combining them. - Mess. D'OLrvs,
GanoLin, Van-Moxs, LavoisER, and others, have slightly
mentioned some of these combinations. But, with. the exception
of Mr. BeRTHOLLET, T'know of no chemist who has approached
80 near to the real state of the combination of muriatic acid
