Observations were made on O, sensibilis, with the result that the basipetal order of
succession was demonstrated. The receptacle is elongated as in Cyathea, and the
sporangia appear first at the apex of it, followed in quick succession by those below.
The number of the sporangia produced is not very large in O. sensibilis, but there
was sufficient evidence of a basipetal sequence, as shown in fig. 90, It will be noted
that a number of cells remain at the base of the receptacle, which have not begun to
develop into sporangia ; these commonly do not progress further. They are
interesting for comparison with O. struthiopteris in which the order of succession is
also basipetal, while the number of sporangia may be larger. In the latter Fern,
numerous immature sporangia may be seen clustering round the base of the receptacle,
at a time when the majority of those seated higher are mature. There is no evidence
of intercalation of young sporangia between the older ones, in fact, the mode of
development of the sorus is like that of the Cyathew, and especially Hemitelia.

But when the sporangium itself is examined the correspondence with Cyathea is
not borne out in detail; a definite regularity of orientation of the sporangia is
certainly suggested by the section shown in fig. 90, but it is not maintained in the
mature sorus, and the sporangia do not show that “ testudo-like” overlapping which
is seen in some Cyathea, and in perfection in the Hymenophyllacez. This is to be
put in relation with the structure of the sporangium itself. The head is still
unequally convex on its two sides, but the annulus is nearly vertical, and runs
directly downwards to the stalk; there it stops short on either side of the
insertion of the head upon the stalk (figs. 91, a, b, ec). Ido not find even that near
relation of the two ends of the annulus to one another, across the stalk which is seen,
