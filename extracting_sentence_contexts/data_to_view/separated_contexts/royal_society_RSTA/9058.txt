THis paper aims, in general, at giving an atomistic theory for magnetic phenomena
in ferromagnetic crystals. In particular, it explains theoretically WexsrEr’s experi-
mental results with regard to iron crystals. As has been pointed out in the abstract,*, the fundamental fact of interest in experi-
ments on magnetic substances is that the direction of magnetization I does not in
general coincide with the direction 4 of the external field H. Experiments on iron
crystals have now revealed that this deviation-effect (¢ — ) exists even in crystals
of cubic structure and a symmetrical boundary. In other words, cubical symmetry
does not make a body magnetically isotropic, as was erroneously assumed by Farapay,
TynpDALL and Priicker. ‘To account for this deviation, and in general to relate the
two directions ¢, 4, with each other must certainly be the object of any theory bearing
on this subject.
