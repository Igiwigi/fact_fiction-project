Contribution from the first diffracted waves
Since the first diffracted wave has already been obtained, its contribution to/(@), and hence
the first terms in the expansion of C and B, can now be calculated. For the case of an incident wave originating inside the channel, the value of F, for the

particular case §) = —7 is required. Its operational form is readily deduced from equation
(13):

F,= F(") exp [ —prcos a) | , e PPG (0<0<m) |
(ar) sin 1d .
e(27r)' sin 10 (28)

fe -F(2)' exp [—preos6] |

Such a wave will emanate from each lip of the channel, F\? being given by (28) and F®
being deduced from the fact that the resulting potential from the two waves is symmetrical
about the centre line of the channel. Thus, considering the interval 0<6<z and remembering
that ;? does not penetrate into the region 41<0<n, we find that the contribution to the
potential outside the channel is

Their asymptotic forms, referred to an origin at the upper lip of the channel, are

It follows immediately that the contribution to /(@) from the first diffracted waves is

The factor (1—exp[—2pbsin |), occurring for 0<6)< 41, is, on referring to equation
(2), precisely that required to produce the two terms

These results may be checked directly if the effect of the successive reflexions is simulated
by an appropriate image series along the y-axis.
