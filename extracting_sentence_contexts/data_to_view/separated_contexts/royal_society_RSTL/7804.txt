*® first gave an account of the very remark-
able meteorite that fell at Shalka, in Bancoorah, Bengal, on the 30th of November, 1850. The ash-like dark grey substance which forms the mass of this meteorite was described
by the illustrious Viennese authority as a new silicate, to which he gave the name of Pid-
dingtonite. He was, in fact, led to do this in consequence of an analysis of the mineral
by K. vox HAvER, which yielded oxygen ratios corresponding to © a compound of bisi-
licate and trisilicate of iron and magnesium.” This assumed sesquisilicate, however, which has haunted the mineralogy of meteorites
under the names of Chladnite, Shepardite, and, subsequently, of Piddingtonite, was sur-
mised by GusTay RosEf to be in this case a mixture of more than one silicate, while in
the similar instance of the Bishopsville meteorite Dr. Lawrexce Smrrn} had already
proved the supposed Chladnite to have been no other than an augitic mineral, in fact |
one with the composition and characters of enstatite. The mineral, however, which |
forms the mass of Shalka does not seem to be 80 easily disposed of; for Professor Raw-
