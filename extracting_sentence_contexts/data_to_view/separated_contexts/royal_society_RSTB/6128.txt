In all the specimens the spines appear to be restricted
to the inner margin of small branches. This is a peculiar and hitherto undescribed
character. The fact that the same character has been repeated in three separate
examples strengthens the probability that the localization of the spines is a natural
feature.

examples with small elevations on their surfaces. In the counterparts these appear
as depressions.
