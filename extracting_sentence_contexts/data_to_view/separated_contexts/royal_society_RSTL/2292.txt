With three similar jars, that is, with three times the surface, the force was only one
ninth part of the respective forces first obseryed. By substituting the electrometer, fig. 2, in place of the balance, the march of the
attractive force may be gradually observed, 80 as to exhibit the above results by
minute degrees, thereby furnishing very interesting experiments.

21. The phyzical causes of these effects are not very apparent ; they seem, how-
ever, to have some connexion with the following fact. The force exerted between
two given suhstances, is more or less diminished by the presence of a neutral or other
body sharing in the attraction. Thus, the excited balls of an electrometer tend to close when an uninsulated
neutral body is brought near them.
