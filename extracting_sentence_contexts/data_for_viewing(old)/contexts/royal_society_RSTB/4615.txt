precluded by means of the pyloric valve already described (p. 112, and text-fig. 10).
An interesting experiment is afforded by enclosing half a dozen or more soldiers in
a phial, unaccompanied by any wood or other available food. These individuals can

be kept alive, and apparently healthy, for several weeks, and their sole nutriment _
consists of rectal matter ejected by their fellows. This material is re-devoured again
and again, until all nourishment has been abstracted therefrom. At this stage,
unless fresh food be supplied, the imprisoned Termites die of starvation, A micro-
scopical examination of the rectal matter, immediately after ejection through the
anus, reveals the fact that Protozoa are present therein. It is, therefore, evident how
these latter organisms are transmitted from one individual to another.

The work of absorbing the wood particles is discharged by Trichonympha and
Trichomonas in the case of Archotermopsis. These larger forms of Protozoa also
subserve this same function in other Termites. It is necessary to point out, however,
that among the intestinal Protozoan fauna are some species which appear to be
parasites. Of these, the most important are members of the genus Dinenympha,
which are attached to the intestinal wall. The Treponema is probably parasitic on
the other Protozoa. Only one species of Sporozoa has so far been discovered in the
intestine of Termites, but this organism does not appear to be either a common
or widely spread form.
