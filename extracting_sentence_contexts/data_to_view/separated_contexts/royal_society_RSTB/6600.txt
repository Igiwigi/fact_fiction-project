It has not yet been
determined whether all the fibres end in the lobe, or if some pass to the chiasma in the
pedal ganglion. Even more remarkable than the spreading out of these statocyst fibres in the lobe,
is the way in which the ventral dendrites of the giant cell itself are entangled in the
n. maculae staticae (figs. 3, 4). Some of the finer dendrites accompany the nerve
beyond the margin of the ganglion proper, and in fact almost to the sensory epithelium
itself. The connexion is so close that it is difficult to believe it to be without functional
significance. It is possible that impulses in the fibres from the statocyst influence the
dendrite by a sort of collateral synapse.
