but it is evident that the effect of humidity on Glossina is not direct, for none of the
phenomena are proportional to it. It follows that the amount of water lost (which
we believe to be determined by saturation deficiency) may be unfavourable because
it is excessive or because it is too little.

One would naturally suppose that the unfavourable effect of high humidity is due
to the accumulation of water in the insect. This is consistent with what is known
for other insects (see Buxton, 1932, p. 297). The general explanation is that at
high temperatures, water of metabolism is produced rapidly and accumulates
in the tissues unless the evaporative power of the air is considerable ; but at low
temperatures the rate of metabolism, and therefore of production of water, is less
so that insects can live normally over a much greater range of relative humidity.
But there is no evidence that this water-logging occurs in Glossina, and the facts in
Table XIII appear to show that it does not occur in unfed flies. The possibility,
however, remains that water accumulates in some organ or tissue with unfavourable
effects on the whole fly. It is also difficult to explain the unfavourable effect of very
low humidity upon the fliesâ€™ appetite, length of life, and birth-rate. We know that
unfed flies burn more fat at lower humidities than at higher, and that in this way
they produce water of metabolism which tends to compensate for excessive loss by
evaporation, Tables XII and XIII. But in similar experiments with fed flies, the
results appear to be contradictory (p. 206). The simple explanation that in very
dry air the fly uses up its food to compensate for evaporation, and therefore has little
material for reproduction, appears therefore to be untenable.

Fig. 14 summarizes much of what is known about Glossina tachinoides which are
