and their larvz, and the roots of trees and plants”*, for the mastication of which its
broad flat grindersF are well adapted. Nevertheless the canines proper are separated
in the upper jaw by not fewer than ten incisors, and in the lower jaw by six incisors}.

The cloven-footed Cheropus, equally polyprotodont, but with digital characters more
closely resembling those of the Artiodactyle Ungulates than in any other marsupial
genus, is not carnivorous. 'The condition of the molars associated with the © three or
more incisors followed by a canine on each side of the jaw,” clearly points to that fact.
The accomplished naturalist and explorer of Australian haunts of animal life thus tes-
tifies of Cheropus castanotis;—* As its dentition would indicate, its food consists of
insects and their larvz, and of vegetable substances of some kind, probably the bark of
trees and tuberous roots”.

In fact the parallel and convergent modifications of all those structures which truly
influence and indicate the food and habits of the animal have been noticed by all who
have devoted the requisite attention to the Marsupial order. GovLp well remarks,
