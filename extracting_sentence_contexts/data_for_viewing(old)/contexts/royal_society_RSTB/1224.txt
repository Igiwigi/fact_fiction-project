a development. In such a case as this, where conclusions from the study

evelopment are in antagonism to those derived from comparison, the former

dgld, in my opinion, give way to the latter.
reover, the custom of reading the development of the individual as illustrating
ylogenetic history, is, at best, based only on experience of its truth in certain
988; because the epitome is found to be often true, it cannot be argued that it will
always true. In the rise of the sporophyte generation in archegoniate plants, I
link we should hold, on grounds of broad comparison, that the development of the
dividual sporophyte cannot be taken en bloc as illustrating the history of the
rigin of the sporophyte at large. While spore-production appears to have been a con-
tantly recurring fact from the first, comparison leads to the conclusion that the extensive
egetative phase which often precedes spore-production in the individual, was of more
hata origin, appearing as an intercalated phase in the life-history. Accordingly it
ects to me improbable that a sporophyll is really to be regarded phylogenetically as
4 metamorphosed foliage leaf; the converse would appear more reasonable,
