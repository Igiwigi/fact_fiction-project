In :
particular, when an H atom migrates from the Rug particle to TiOz or ZrOz, the nuclear motion [=
is accompanied by a charge flow from the metal to the oxide. Note, however, that things are 3
different on the bare surface of zirconia when more than one H is adsorbed. In this case, in :
fact, the preferred situation is that corresponding to the formation of a proton and a hydride 1G
ion (heterolytic mechanism). This is because a hydride ion bound to Zr** has its levels at lower :
energy than the Zr 4d states. : Ke]

These theoretical results shed light at the atomistic level on the mechanism of hydrogen 2S
spillover and are fully consistent with experimental observations. For instance, Panayotov and 7S
Yates [62] demonstrated in a study of hydrogen spillover on Au/TiO2 that the rate of spillover : &

is proportional to Pi, indicating that the H atoms originate from the equilibrium dissociative
adsorption of H2 on the Au particle.
