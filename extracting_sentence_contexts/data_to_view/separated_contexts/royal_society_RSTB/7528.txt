Crawling activity did
not stop altogether even during the night, and basking became general almost immediately
after sunrise. But there was no sustained flying, and no mass departure. A consistent
direction did appear on 10 June, which is shown as streaming in figure 2, but in fact these
locusts settled with every small increase of wind. Had they remained in the air they would
certainly have been turned down-wind, and such alternating orientation has been described
as surging. On 11 June, a warmer day, the locusts flew rather more uninterruptedly, rising
higher in the air.
