Calamites.

Our knowledge of the structure of the cortical tissues of Calamites is yet very
imperfect. A specimen from the Gannister bed at Moorside, near Ashton-under-Lyne,
for which I am indebted to Mr. GzorGe WilD, supplies a new fact. In the memoir,
Part IX., figs. 8-10 and 13, I have represented the primitive undifferentiated state
of the cortical parenchyma of Calamites ; and in figs. 14 and 15 of the game memoir, I
have shown that a thick prosenchymatous layer was formed in the bark of some older

A stems, In Mr. WrrD's specimen, fig. 19, the vasculo-medullary axis presents the
A _usual features, except that the vascular wedges are more detached than ordinary
S owing to the partial disappearance of the cells of the primary medullary rays. The
= innermost bark, a, differs but little from the primitive state seen in the figs. 8-10 and
£ 13 jus referred to; but at b we have a hypodermal zone of specialised bundles of
D what seem to have been prosenchymatous cells. Each bundle has a triangular section,
© the apex being centripetal, and is from *012 to *008 from base to apex. The onter-
S most bark, c, appears to have been a thin epidermal layer, some *003 to *002 in thickness.
