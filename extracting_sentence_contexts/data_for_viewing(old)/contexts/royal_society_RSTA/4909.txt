Proof. (Outline) From the proof of the holonomy theorem in [9, ch. 3] and so also for the
emulating ensemble in theorem 6.1, it is clear that, in lifting a state for the emulation, only certain
components are used (i.e. have non-trivial values). Let these components be present with the
topology given as a suborder of <j but expanding some nodes by parallel copies as in the
proof of theorem 6.1. Then using the interaction machine notion, when a lifted input symbol a
corresponding to a € A acts on the machine, all present components are updated according to the
usual cascade formulation, but those constituents where a value should fall that have not been
set before come into existence at that moment with the appropriate state value. This continues as
each input symbol acts, resulting in a growing cascade. a

Remarks on recurrence. Transience of the natural subsystems (X,(X)per) of A is a natural
consequence of the fact that semigroups allow for irreversible change. However, with the notion
of an interaction machine as formulated here and an ensemble approach in which new instances of
A may continually arise, this transience itself becomes a recurring phenomenon, as do instances
of the natural subsystems given by its permutation groups (X,(X)per). Semigroups such as the
natural numbers N or real numbers R are taken in physics as models of time. But more generally
(see footnote 33), we can consider A*, the free semigroup over an alphabet A of basic events
a¢€A, or the semigroup S(A) of a discrete dynamical system A, as its appropriate model of time.
In an interaction machine 2, for different times t ¢ A*, a new copy of A may repeatedly arise
as a component of 2. The semigroup S(A) and the natural subsystems (X,(X)per) of A may
be repeatedly encountered. Recurrence of full possibilities of the full state space of A (due to


growing and changing dynamics of 2 allowing the reproduction of more copies of the system)
