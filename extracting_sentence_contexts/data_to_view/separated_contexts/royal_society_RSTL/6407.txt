In these also the
Hole on the top of the seed is somewhat more widened, as in the fossil species. As to
5 the shape, the latter differs in s far as the seeds are comparatively somewhat wider
by (those of I. alba melocarps are 33 millims. long and 2 millims. wide): this more con-
= 8iderable breadth may have been caused by pressure, since they are all highly com-
=D pressed. To the same circumstance we may ascribe the fact that the raphe cannot be
= pointed out distinctly.

= The seeds of Bovey are very like those of my Nymphea Charpentieri (Flora Tertiaria,
- iti. p. 195, pl. 155. fig. 20 6, c), the latter being only s0mewhat narrower. It would
= therefore be very desirable that the leaves be sought for at Boyey, since from these
S alone can it be decided with certainty whether this species is really distinct from
> N. Charpentieri, to which it comes very near, The seeds of the living Nymphew are
= yariable in their dimensions.
