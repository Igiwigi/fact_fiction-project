Italy [114,116]. Brooks et al. [117] show that uniform or randomized maps perform better than
the Japanese National Hazard Maps, at least using the metric inherent in these maps.

How well the probabilistic approach used in most studies actually describes future shaking
is unknown, primarily because such hazard maps have not been tested repeatedly with real
data. This situation differs from familiar applications, such as coin-tossing, which in contrast to : =

probabilistic maps, can be tested with human time scales [118]. Stein & Friedrich [116] conclude Sy
that while the uncertainty of events occurring on plate boundaries can be significantly reduced, 2
the timing of the earthquakes cannot, while uncertainties on the size can only reduce significantly aed
for the smaller events and not the very large ones. 22

Although maps may be improved by better estimating some parameters, the fact that others : Ss
cannot be much better estimated limits how good maps can possibly be. Hence, Stein et al. [119] DNS
assert that it is better to recognize and communicate the uncertainties involved. They thus propose : =
methods to assess how well a specific map performed and how to revise maps [120]. We note that : s

estimating the probabilities distribution of tsunami on-land elevations at a given site involves the
additional identification of the anomalous tsunami earthquakes, which as [27] discusses account
for three of the 17 events in the past 11 years; predicting whether a given earthquake will be
anomalous is impossible, before it happens. We thus hope that similar measures can be developed
for testing probabilistic tsunami hazard maps, which have recently been promoted by national
agencies and engineering consultants, often without an even glancing reference to how well these
approaches have worked for earthquakes, much less for tsunamis.
