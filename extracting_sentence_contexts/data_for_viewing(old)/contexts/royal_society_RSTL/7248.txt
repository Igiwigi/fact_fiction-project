An © undistributed weight ” is a weight which, in the same system of events, is not 80
resolved or 80 made up. An undistributed weight may also be defined as a weight
which is resolved into one weight, or made up from one weight alone.

This division of weights into distributed and undistributed weights is coextensive with
the previous division of the same into compound and simple weights. A distributed
weight is necessarily a compound weight, for we can always assert its identity as a whole
with the parts into which it is distributed; and a weight which is not distributed
can only be regarded as a simple weight, for, by hypothesis, no information is supplied
to us from the system of events under consideration, which enables us to assert its
identity with any other weights, such an assertion in every case being purely relative to
the facts before us, and open to modification by the acquisition of further knowledge.

It is essential to remark that the previous definitions are definitions of abstract con-
ceptions, which have immediate reference to the symbolic method deyeloped in the fol-
lowing section, for the construction of which they afford an adequate basis, and which
is necessarily more comprehensive than those special subjects of physical investigation
to which it is hereafter to be applied.

SzoTron IT.—ON THE SYMBOLS OF CHEMICAL OPERATIONS.

Having explained the nature of those objects and relations which fall under the con-
8ideration of the chemist as the investigator of the laws of the distribution of weight, I
proceed to consider their symbolic expression.
