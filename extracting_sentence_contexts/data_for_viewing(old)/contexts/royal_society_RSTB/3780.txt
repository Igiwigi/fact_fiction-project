2 CAPTAIN C, F. U. MEEK ON A METRICAL

studied by Henxine, Montcomery, Pauimrer, Stevens, and Wirson; and the
Coleoptera by AvERBACH, Depaistrux, HENDERSON, and HonmGren. Doncaster,
HenkinG, and Mark have written upon Hymenoptera ; GRGNBERG, Meves, Munson,
and Sprcnarpt upon Lepidoptera; and CHoLopKovsky and Srevens upon the
Diptera. The Orthoptera are particularly good material, and we now possess
detailed accounts of development of the sex-cells in Forficulide, Blattidee, Phasmidee,
Acridiidee, Locustide, and Gryllide. The study of these numerous types has led to
the discovery of many important facts, and to the enunciation of several hypotheses.

The results appear similar throughout the Metazoa, and the process of development
in the male organism may be summarised as follows: The spermatogonial resting
stages show the chromatin disposed in granules upon linin threads, while the nucleus
usually appears as a complete reticulum. In polar views of the metaphase, the
somatic number of chromosomes is seen in the equatorial plane ; this number varies,
but is constant for the species. In many organisms the chromosomes have been
observed to be paired, and to possess definite size-relationships, which persist in the
later spermatocytes ; this was discovered by Surron in Brachystola magna, and has
since been noted by many cytologists. In certain groups, moreover, the number of
chromosomes is uneven, and the presence of an odd or unpaired chromosome has led
to speculation upon the problem of sex-determination ; this chromosome is the
