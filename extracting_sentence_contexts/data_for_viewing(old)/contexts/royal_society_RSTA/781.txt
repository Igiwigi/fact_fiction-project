When we consider information processing in larger-scale quantum devices, it is useful to divide
that process into two fundamental layers: a physical device layer responsible for control and
manipulation of the ‘qubits’, and an application level layer to perform the computation/data
manipulation (this is illustrated in figure 4 for an NV modular device). The physical layer
can further be divided into a number of sublayers, each responsible for a different part of the
computational system. Nonetheless, these sublayers are not completely independent of each other :
due to the fact that we cannot control errors in the computational system with only one sublayer. [=
This complicates the system’s error management; however, it also gives us the opportunity to 38
manage errors even when the physical system has weaknesses. Sublayers can work together :
to compensate weakness in the physical system (as illustrated in our previous example). The aoa)
interaction between sublayers also complicates our attempt to optimize the overall system. :
Optimization of one sublayer may be detrimental to another sublayer. This fact was illustrated D4
in our example when for instance a one-way cavity design was considered. The optimization ae
needs to be done on the system, which clearly indicates the importance of the architecture of aon
the system. [BB
In this paper, we focused our attention on quantum information systems where we can realize ,

large pure quantum states (large enough to run quantum information tasks). This is a necessary
approach for these applications which require high-fidelity quantum coherence. However, there

might be some class of quantum emulation which will not require such high quantum coherence.

For instance, many quantum phenomena can be observed in a rather noisy environment. To
understand these quantum phenomena, simulation of the Hamiltonian of the system might
