The general course of reasoning given above, led me to make some direct experi-
| ments on the subject. The result completely confirmed the justice of the deductions
& drawn from microscopical examination. Since I propose to discuss in a later paper
a the whole question of the formation of pre-products by gland-cells, I will here only
S briefly mention the main facts which show that zymogen and not ferment is stored up
& by the glands we are considering.
= Tf the cesophagus or stomach of a Frog be placed in glycerine as rapidly as possible
© after removal from the body, the glycerine extract has only a weak peptic power. S If the eesophagus or stomach of a Frog be kept moist for twenty-four hours before
S it is placed in glycerine, the glycerine extract has a very much greater peptic power.
= Tf the cesophagus and stomach which has been extracted with, say, 5 cub. centims. of
2 glycerine for a week be washed free of glycerine and treated with 5 cub. centims. of
S dilute hydrochloric acid, then an enormously greater amount of pepsin is found in the
S acid than is found in the glycerine extract.

&= The glycerine extracts increase somewhat, although only slightly, in peptic power
S when treated with dilute acid for twenty-four hours.

© BSince in testing a glycerine extract for pepsin, hydrochloric acid is added, it is possible that eyen the
= 8mall amount of pepsin found in it may arise from the splitting up by the acid of combined pepsin. EZ Thexe facts, I think, show that both the cesophageal and gastric glands form zymogen
which under certain conditions, and particularly when acted on by dilute acids, give
S rise to pepsin, The zymogen is only slightly soluble in glycerine.
