between dry and humid bones,

The difference between this result for the femur and Broca’s is very considerable. I think it is due to the fact that he allowed his bones to dry for 24 hours in a room
before measuring them. I was much impressed by the rapidity with which the bones
dried, and their conditions, of course, are very unlike what they would be if containing
or surrounded by animal matter. It is clear that the extensions due to humidity are
not by any means proportional to the length of the bone, and it would be quite futile
to attempt any percentage allowance for the extension due to this cause, the effect of
which clearly differs with the different structure of different parts of the same bone.
