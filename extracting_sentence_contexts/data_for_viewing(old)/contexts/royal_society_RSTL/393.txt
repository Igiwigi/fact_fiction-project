it does not taste sour, but is extremely astringent and corrod-
ing ; when applied to the tongue, it leaves for a long while
a very disagreeable sensation.

It occurred to me that the gas procured from the hyper-oxy-
muriate by the action of liquid muriatic acid, might be a mere
mixture of this gas and chlorine ; and two in volume of this
gas and three in volume of chlorine, would produce by explo-
sion the same products as euchlorine. The only fact which I
am acquainted with, opposed to the idea, is the circumstance of
dutch foil not burning spontaneously in the gas from muriatic
acid, which might be expected if it contained as much as 4 of
uncombined chlorine; though the force of this argument is
suspended, till it is supported by an experiment showing that
dutch foil inflames in a mixture of two of the deep yellow
gas, and three of chlorine. I have not yet been able to pro-
cure at Rome, metallic foil fitted for this experiment.

I have ascertained that the gas from hyper-oxymuriate and
muriatic acid, though it acts much more slowly upon water
than the other gas, yet in the end gives it the same tint and
