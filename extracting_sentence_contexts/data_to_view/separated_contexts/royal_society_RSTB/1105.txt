It is obvious that the excitability of the cortex and the intensity of
the exciting agency, must be the chief agents in determining the amount of this
effect. The extent of such a deflection when, as evidenced by well-marked move-
ments of the muscles on both sides in the upper half of the body, a considerable
cortical discharge of energy was taking place, has amounted in the Monkey to 360
scale ; it was however, at once abolished by profound aneesthetisation. As a rule the
deflections amounted to from 20 to 60 scale; no doubt they would have been larger,
had it not been for the fact that, since their appearance interfered with accurate
observation of cortical effects evoked by stimulation, we always took care on perceiving
them to so alter our conditions of anesthesia as to abolish this source of error.

2. Electrical Changes in the Sciatic Nerve. After having thus considered the electrical changes produced in the spinal cord by
the functional activity of the cortex, we next turned our attention to the more
complex question of what occurs in the peripheral nerves when the cortex is excited.
