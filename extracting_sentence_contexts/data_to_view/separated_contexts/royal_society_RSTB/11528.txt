This is, however, not sufficient to say
that the two definitions are identical. First of all, working
memory is a theoretical concept described in different ways
(e.g. [9]). Carruthers [8] points out that the first definition
above [1] is dispositional, i.e. that Block here suggests that a
content is A-conscious if it is available (actually or counter-
factually to control systems). Carruthers continues to argue
that the second definition by Block [4] suggests that infor-
mation is A-conscious only in an actual sense, i.e. if it is
received as input by executive and decision-making systems. Chalmers [7] suggested a different definition of access,
namely that information is A-conscious if the content is
available for a range of different behavioursâ€”especially
voluntary behaviour.
