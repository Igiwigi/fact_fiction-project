development. An apparatus was, however, constructed by means of which a potential
fall of 2°0 to 3°4 volts was obtained at the anion boundary ; under these conditions
the whole column of liquid was seen to be mixed by rapid convection currents.

It has been occasionally noticed that with the same boundary the inferior limit
apparently differs according to the direction from which it is approached ; thus for the

gradually increased, no margin can be detected at 0°29 volt, whereas starting with
0-4 volt and diminishing, the boundary does not entirely disappear until a potential
fall of 0°17 volt is reached. This is due to the fact that with a lower potential fall a
longer time is required before the stationary condition is reached than with a higher’
one, and if before an experiment is started a little diffusion takes place at the point
where gelatine and aqueous solutions are in contact, it is possible that the margin
may have travelled right through the tube before it has become visible.
