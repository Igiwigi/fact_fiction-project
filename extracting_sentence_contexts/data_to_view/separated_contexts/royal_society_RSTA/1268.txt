This means that the ellipsoidal ferrogel at saturation stretched
by 37% in the direction parallel to the magnetic field and contracted by 15% in the transverse
direction. The characteristic time was t = 440s, the same for both the major and minor semi-axes.

3. Theoretical model of the magnetostriction

(a) Elasto-viscous approach

The fact that the measured storage modulus Gâ€™ of the sample does not depend on the frequency
of oscillations (figure 2) allows us to hope to describe its behaviour in the framework of the
concept of elastic sample with the internal viscosity. To this end, we consider an incompressible
magnetizable elastic sample, illustrated in figure 5. Under the action of the applied magnetic field Ho, the sample elongates in the z direction.
