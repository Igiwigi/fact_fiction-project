an amazing feature of this hypothetical type of energy the fact that it has unified in a single quest
the incredible spectrum of modified gravity theories and other exotic forms of energy to search
for the missing explanation of this observed effect.


Dark energy appears as a property inherent in space-time because it is perfectly uniform and
insensitive to space-time being empty or full of galaxies, or with respect to the direction we
look, or the era in the universe history, or spatial location. The constraints from the supernovae
observations, the CMB temperature fluctuations and the baryon acoustic oscillations (that is
residual sound waves imprinted in the clustering patterns) all converge to the astonishing dark
energy budget of about 72% in the overall matter energy content of the universe. Another
component of the remaining material in the universe consists of dark matter with a percentage
of about another 24%. The mysterious fact that the visible components of matter and radiation
may constitute only about a tiny 4% of the overall distribution, represents perhaps the most
unbelievable, unexplained result in the whole history of astronomy.

We thus see that the fundamental themes required for an adequate explanation of the
cosmological constant, the energy of the vacuum and the nature of dark energy are all
linked together as suggested by both theory and observations. The completely and seemingly
disparate and independent fields such as scalar-tensor theory, higher-order gravity, theories
with screening, Palatini cosmology, effective theories, Horndeski gravity, higher-dimensional
cosmology, Born-Infeld type theories, holographic theory and many others, appear as one
field having different facets in this sense; for various excellent reviews of this vast field,
see [165-172].
