first to prove by his work on the light-sensitiveness and the coloration of the crystals,
that the colloid must be uniformly distributed through them. He found that silver
bromide precipitated from ammoniacal solution containing 2% of gelatine took up
about 0-1%. But the available quantitative data are very sparse. SHEPPARD,
Lampert, and Krenan§ stated in 1932 that beyond this observation of REINDERS
and a single earlier one by Eprr, they had been unable to glean anything from the
literature.

They have themselves given the most recent figures (/oc. cit.). Silver bromide was
prepared “in gelatine solution ” and was washed at 50° and centrifuged. After two
washings the absorption had become constant at 0-34%. Acidity of the medium
had no effect. Only one-half of the absorbed gelatine could be removed by long
treatment with boiling water. This fact seems to indicate clearly that most of the
gelatine had been taken up during growth and had become embedded in the crystal.
When precipitates of bromide free from colloid were placed in contact with gelatine
solutions of stated concentrations, much higher adsorptions were found, tending to a
limit of, roughly, 3% in a solution containing about 10°%, of gelatine. This high
adsorption by the preformed crystals is difficult to understand when compared with
the results given here, but may be explained according to Suzpparp by the much
finer grain of the colloid-free bromide.
