ELECTROMOTIVE FORCES OF THE ELECTRIC ARC. 329

Seat of the Back E.M.F, Search Carbons in the Are. The fact that the are has a back E.M.F. which appears to increase with the amount
of foreign substances present in the vapour column, at once leads to the question
whether this E.M.F. is located at one or the other of the electrodes, or distributed
along the vapour column. In order to obtain an answer to this question, some
experiments were made on a 6-millim. 9°91 ampére solid are by introducing a search
carbon, 2 millims.
