When no brass disks were used, it was found that
§ the weights delivered on each Hoffman roller were constant to + 1-5 %. With a bottom brass
g disk, the variation in weight of explosive was somewhat larger (+4-5°%), owing to small
A differences in thickness and curvature of the disks. In view of the fact that the probability of
detonation does not appear to be sensitive to the thickness of the layer of explosive, within
the range investigated, these minor variations in weight may be neglected. Discussion

The following comments may be made on the results listed in table 50.

(1) It will be noted that with the exception of compositions based on mercury fulminate or
L.D.N.R. (lead di-nitro-resorcinate), the percussion sensitiveness of all the other initiators
listed in table 50 is of the same order.
