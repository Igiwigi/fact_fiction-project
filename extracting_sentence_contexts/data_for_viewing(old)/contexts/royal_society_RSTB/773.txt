furnishes an important point of agreement with the Carinate.

Stages F and G (Plate 17, figs. 234-236).

In these stages the shoulder-girdle has undergone very little advance except in
size and in the increased development of the acrocoracoid tuberosity (aer.cor.),
which is now a well-marked process considerably larger proportionally than in the
adult. Its dimensions are well seen in fig. 236, which shows two obliquely transverse
sections through the junction of the scapula and coracoid in Stage G. Both pass
through the acrocoracoid («cr.cor.), and B, which is three sections caudad of A,
also passes through the supracoracoid foramen (swp.cor,for.).

The coraco-vertebral angle is still acute, as shown by the fact that obliquely
transverse sections of it were obtained by cutting an embryo (A. australis, Stage G)
at right angles to the long axis of the trunk, but the inclination is considerably less
than in the preceding stage, amounting to about 60° in Stage F.

Stage H (Plate 17, figs. 237 and 238).

The two specimens belonging to this stage show a very important step in the
development of the shoulder-girdle. In the younger of the two (A. owen, fig. 237)
the scapula (scap.) is ossified, but the coracoid has undergone no alteration, being
still a solid cartilage with a very prominent acrocoracoid tuberosity.

In the other embryo (A. bulleri, fig. 238) the scapula is similarly ossified, but the
