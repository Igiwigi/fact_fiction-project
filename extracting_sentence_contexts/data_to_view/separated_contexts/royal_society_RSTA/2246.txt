The present results show an equivalence between three approaches to extending contextuality : Pe
analysis to inconsistently connected systems: Cavalcanti’s generalized no-fine-tuning principle : =
[18] for causal probabilistic models, formalized here in terms of minimal direct influence D8
(M-contextuality); Cervantes and Dzhafarov’s no-conspiracy principle [14], formalized here as a are
restriction to aligned causal models; and the purely mathematical framework of CbD [16]. Thus, in
the requirement of multimaximal couplings in CbD is equivalent to the assumption that direct 1
influences (in the causal sense used here) are no greater than needed to explain the marginal —
distributions of individual observables, as well as to the assumption that direct influences never
cancel out, even partially. Although there is a sense in which any mathematical definition is as
good as any other, the fact that three different principles all converge on the same classification
of systems into contextual and noncontextual might be taken as a stronger indication of the likely
scientific utility of this classification. Another main contribution of this article, beyond the correspondence between the particular
definitions analysed, is the translation between the CbD and model-based approaches. Under
this translation, alternative conditions on couplings correspond to alternative criteria for direct
influence.
