VISCOSITY OF AIR.

653. The mean of a very large number of closely concordant results gives as the
logarithmic decrement for air for the special apparatus employed, at a pressure of 760
millims. of mercury and a temperature of 15% C., the number 0:1124. According to
MAXWELL the viscosity should remain constant until the rarefaction becomes 80 great
that we are no longer at liberty to consider the mean free path of the molecules as
practically insignificant in comparison with the dimensions of the yessel.

My observations show that this theoretical result of Maxwerr's is sufficiently near
the actual fact in air to confirm the accuracy of his reasoning, although there is a
variation showing that disturbing influences are at work which make the coefficient of
viscosity (taken as proportional to the logarithmic decrement) nob quite constant.

The results are embodied in the following table and diagrams.

The first half of Table I. gives the viscosity of air, in 80 far as it is represented by
the log. decs., at pressures intermediate between 760 millims. and 0:76 millim. (1000
millionths of an atmosphere), In order to avoid the inconvenience of frequent refer-
ence to small fractions of a willimetre, I now take the millionth of an atmosphere*
(=M) as the unit instead of the millimetre. The second half of the table is therefore
given in millionths, going up to an exhaustion of 0:02 millionth of an atmosphere, the
highest point to which I have carried the measurements, although by no means the
