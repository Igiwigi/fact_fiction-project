It appeared to me, indeed, that a point of
far higher interest than the actual value to be ascribed to the specific heat of the gas
was the question as to the nature of its variation with change of pressure. In the very next series, VII., however, my intention of duplicating the experiments
was frustrated. In releasing the gas, in fact, at the conclusion of the series, I detected
an odour of nitrous fumes, which induced me to seek the source of the impurity and
start a fresh series. The source of the impurity turned out to be the tube containing
the nitrate of silver, which was probably becoming affected by acid carried by the gas. The tube was suppressed, and a tube containing copper potassium tartrate, carried on
pumice, substituted.
