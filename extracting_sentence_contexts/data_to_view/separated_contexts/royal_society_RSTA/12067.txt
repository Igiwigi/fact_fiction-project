It seemed desirable, if only to serve as a check on the experiments, to mention
the attempt that I made to determine directly the yielding of the glass vessel. For
this purpose the alcohol was boiled out until only a very small residue was left, when
mercury was allowed to enter which completely filled up the whole instrument. This
mercury, whose compressibility is some fifty times less than that of alcohol, was then

pressure), and the retreat of the end of the mercury column along the tube was

noted. The following measures of this recession were obtained for a pressure of 10
