gradients to survival in wild mammals, the sexes were not
differentiated in some cases [8,10], but in others, only females
have been studied [5-7,9,11-13,26-28]. This focus on females
stems from the fact that, in most social mammals, including
most primates, females typically remain in their natal group
throughout their lives, while males move in and out of
study populations, resulting in individuals with truncated
data (unknown dates of birth) and censored data (disap-
peared with unknown fate). Therefore, it remains unclear to
what extent strong social bonds and high social status
enhance longevity in male non-human primates, as they do
in men [1,2,4,29,30]. Understanding the link between social
environments and longevity in males is important: if the
male pattern is different to the female pattern, different selec-
tion pressures on social behaviour will apply in the two sexes;
if the patterns are similar, social relationships for males might
