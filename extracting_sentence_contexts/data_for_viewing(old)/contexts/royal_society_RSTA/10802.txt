sin (s + 2k). In the second form s and 7 differ as to evenness and oddness, and the
function, written C; or §S%, is expressed by a similar series multiplied by
(1 — B cos 2¢)!.

The combination of the two forms of P-function with the four forms of cosine- and
sine-function gives the eight types of solid harmonic.

Corresponding to the two eg of P-function there are two forms of Q-function,

such that Q/ and Q? NW eo re ave expansible in a series of ordinary Q-functions ;

but whereas the series for ye: aed P* are terminable, because P’ vanishes when s is
greater than 7, this is not the case with the Q-functions. In fact the series for the
()-functions begins with Q; or Q;, and the order of the Q’s increases by two at a time
up to s when we have the principal or central term ; it then goes on increasing up to
s =? ori — 1, and on to infinity.

In spherical and spheroidal analysis the differential equation satisfied by P*
involves the integer s, whereby the order is specified. So here also the differential
equations, satisfied by 38/ or P/ and by €;, $’, or C7, S}, involve a constant, but it
is no longer an integer. It seemed convenient to assume s°—Bo as the form for
this constant, where s is the known integer specifying the order of harmonic, and
o remains to be determined from the differential equations,

When the assumed forms for the P-function and for the cosine- and sine-functions
