in order to obtain the free energy per unit length of the step itself, we must divide the
expression by (1+h?)!.

In the general case the extended form of (78) is exceedingly cumbersome, so we again
consider some particular cases. For the (0,1) step at low temperatures the formula (78)
gives

Foy = 4(91 +262) —2k Tm ; (79)
under the same conditions the corresponding quantity for the (1,1) step is
Fy = $+ $2—2kT In (1+). (80)

The contribution of the entropy of the kinks to the edge free energy is small for the (0, 1)
step, but for the (1,1) step it is not negligible. In fact, at temperatures for which 7, ~ 1,
formula (80) gives 2k7' In 2 ~ 0-07, or a third of ¢,.

At reasonable temperatures the free energy is always smaller for the (0,1) step than for
any other, so we might conclude that steps other than the (0, 1) steps are not in real equili-
brium, and that there must be a tendency for these steps to change into (0,1) steps. If the

steps are infinite, this conclusion would be erroneous. Actually, every step is in equilibrium
with the same vapour pressure. Moreover, although the (0,1) step has the smallest free
energy, there is no tendency for other steps to change their orientation, because even the
