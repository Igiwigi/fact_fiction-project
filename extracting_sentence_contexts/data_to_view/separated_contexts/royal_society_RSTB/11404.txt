However, the present model
does not fully cover all of the stages of the cultural emergence
of a concept of zero [47], which at the highest level involves
assigning zero a precise symbolic role in the system of arith-
metic (place-holder in Arabic notation, neutral element for
addition, etc.).

(b) The successor function

Our neural implementation of an analogue of Peano’s succes-
sor function, a fundamental requisite of arithmetic, should
not be confused with the successor function familiar to devel-
opmental psychologists, i.e. the laborious acquisition, during
childhood, of a system of exact number symbols 1, 2, 3...
linked through counting. While our model accounts for
how human and non-human primates, as well as other
species, can be innately endowed with approximate number
vectors, much remains to be understood about how these vec-
tors are linked, on the perceptual side, to sets of objects, and
on the abstract side, to symbols such as Arabic numerals or
verbal number words. In fact, because the number states in
our theory have exponentially vanishing distances, it is
doubtful that exactly the same mechanism could be recycled
for exact numbers, where the distance between consecutive
numbers would presumably need to remain constant.

(c) Levels of description

Although our theory for the origins of number vectors includes
realistic properties such as Dale’s principle, sparsity of neural
activity patterns and sparse and distance-dependent connec-
tivity, it describes brain activity at an abstract mathematical
level similar in spirit to the classical Hopfield model for
neural networks [50]. This abstract nature need not be a disad-
vantage, for it also allows knowledge acquired in the
mathematical field of random matrices to shed light onto the
neuroscience of number. Specifically, our simulations suggest
that the Weber—Fechner Law for numbers arises from an
eigenvector algorithm that runs on a population of neurons
with random synaptic strengths, and a propensity to connect
with neighbours that is set at criticality (figure 8; electronic
supplementary material, Note S11).
