potential, though, as we shall see later, this is not in accordance with MaxweE i's
usage of the term; and, what is perhaps of more importance, there is something
arbitrary about it apart from the arbitrary additive constant which every potential
involves, i


THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM. 723

The second thing to notice is that the E of equation (29) is not what is usually
known as the electromotive force. The physical fact that is usually stated by saying
that E = RK, must with the present notation be stated by saying that E = 0, since
— RK appears on the right of equation (29) as a part of the term — ,Vx. This, of
course, is due to the fact that E of equation (29) is physically defined as the part of
the electromotive force not depending on friction,

D. Change of Variables in 1, d, and «x.

51. In what follows with reference to change of variables, we shall always speak as
if the change had reference only to /. Exactly similar reasoning applies to similar
changes of variables in any other function such as }, a, or a part only of any one of
these. There is, indeed, no reason why the function should be a scalar.

So far, 7 has been assumed an explicit function of the list of variables (25), § 27.
These are by far the most convenient variables for most mathematical operations, and
we shall continue as often as otherwise so to regard 7. For many physical interpreta-
