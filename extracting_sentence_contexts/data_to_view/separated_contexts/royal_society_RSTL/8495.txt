The temporary rise in April is, I think, to be attributed to the expansion of the lower
Satmosphere, by which, for a time, a larger proportion of the atmosphere is lifted above
Sthe level of 7000 and 8000 feet. This requires further investigation. © Certain effects of the Winds —T haye now discussed most of the more important facts
Z ralating to temperature, vapour-diffusion, and atmospheric pressure, to be gathered from
© the registers of the past few years, in 0 far as they bear on the causes of the winds. It
Sremains to notice certain effects of the winds, especially on temperature and rainfall ;
"®and I shali then briefly sum up the results of the whole discussion, and add a few
eremarks, in an Appendix, on the storms of the Bay of Bengal, to the explanation of
Zwhich a knowledge of the normal wind-system is indispensable. = In respect of temperature, it is obvious that, except in the case of dynamic heating
Zand cooling, a wind cannot per 86 raise the temperature of a place above, nor depress
vat below, that of the region from which it immediately comes.
