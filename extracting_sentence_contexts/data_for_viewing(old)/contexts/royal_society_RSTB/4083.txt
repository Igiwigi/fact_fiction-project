pulsation in this region—apparently in the floor of this cavity, but the opacity and activity of the larve
make it very hard to study, and it is, moreover, much slower and less regular than in echinid plutei.”
Then with reference to the pluteus of Ecliinus microtuberculatus, he tells us (9, p. 76) that the floor of the
vesicle projects far up into its cavity, and that the pulsation “is certainly continued in the earliest
post-larval stages, though whether it occurs ini the adult I am unable to say.” MrtTscHNrIKOFF had
already (64, p. 63) referred to the presence of a pulsating heart-like tube close to the pore-canal in late
echinid plutei. Rhythmic pulsation on the part of the pericardium of Zvrnaria has been mentioned by
various authors, and first apparently by Frirz MULLER (SPENGEL, 88, p. 3).

* The dorsal sac is large and definite in the brachiolaria of Porania. I had the opportunity of
watching its contractions in a late double-hydroceele larva of this species. Here, no doubt owing to
restriction of space, the sac was narrow from side to side though elongated from before backwards. The
very significant fact emerged that, on the whole, the contractions of the floor of the sac began posteriorly
and progressed in a forward direction. The posteriorly placed spongy spaces underneath the sac, i.,
those nearest to the stomach, were therefore the first, and the anteriorly placed spaces were the last to
be emptied of their contents. It will be remembered that in Balanoglossus the dorsal vessel of the trunk
which collects blood from the gut walls is afferent to the “heart sinus” underneath the pericardium,
