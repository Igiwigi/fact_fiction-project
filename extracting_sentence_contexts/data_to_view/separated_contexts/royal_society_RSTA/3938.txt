Sexual reproduction may produce a
type which is not that of either parent, but this does not @ fortiori alter the vari-
ability of the race with regard to any organ. With continuous variation such type
would have previously existed as far as any special organ or character is concerned,
and its repetition contributes nothing to the racial variability. We have to meet the
fact that the individual produces undifferentiated like organs with a remarkable
degree of variety, and if the investigations of the present memoir be valid the
practical result of the homotyposis factor having a value of *4 to ‘5 would denote that
the individual variability is 91°65 to 86°60 per cent. of the racial. (25.)
