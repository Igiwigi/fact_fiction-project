The function ©, like the several component terms, is of course of the degree
3 in the coefficients of U, and of the degree 2(4—2) in (a, y, 2).

4. It is to be remarked that the formula applies to a cubic; we have here smply
Q.=DH. which agrees with a result already mentioned. Lt may be noticed also that in
the general case the formula gives at once the condition for the points of inflexion ; in
fact, if the point (, y, 2) be a point of inflexion, then one of the tangentials must coin-
cide with this point, or the equation Q=0 will be satisfied by writing therein (@, y, 2)
for (X, Y,Z); but when this is done D"-*H, D*-*H, &c. reduce themselves (to numerical
factors pres) to H, and the equation becomes simply TL[=0, which is the well-known
condition for the points of inflexion.

5. If two of the tangentials coincide, or what is the same thing, if the tangent V=0
touches the curve Q=0, then the point (z, y, 2) will be the point of contact of a double
tangent. 'The equation which expresses the condition in question, treating therein
