Education was strongly nega-
tively related to fertility, as predicted, but clearly this
relationship could not be explained by its influence on
wages, sensu Becker, given the positive effect of income on
reproductive outcomes. In addition, the educational gradient
was almost fully explained by unintended births, and there
was no major difference in the fertility desires of highly edu-
cated women compared with their less educated counterparts
([64]; see also [56,81]), although the former do tend to experi-
ence a larger gap between intended and realized births [81]. Thus, the fact that some aspects of Becker’s theory no longer
provide a good fit to behaviour within the USA and beyond,
suggest that incorporating its assumptions and predictions
into a general evolutionary framework should be treated
with a certain degree of caution.

(a) Cultural history and contingent decision-making

Occasionally, historical data are also at odds with economic
models of fertility, including embodied capital theory. During the British industrial revolution, for example, the
introduction of new technologies did not increase the
demand for skilled labour (at least initially), and work in
the labour market was often substituted for education [82]. The ability of children to engage in paid labour meant they
continued to remain productive, even within the context of
increasing industrialization, rather than becoming the kind
of ‘consumption goods’ assumed by embodied capital
theory.
