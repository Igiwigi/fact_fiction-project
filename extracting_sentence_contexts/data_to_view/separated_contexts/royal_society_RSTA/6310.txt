But
zonally averaged meridional flow is potentially a small residual of western boundary current and
return flow in the eastern basin, as the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) in the North
Pacific shows (e.g. [27,28]), so there is no a priori reason why isotropy—i and v scale alike—
should be a good assumption. Instead, a scaling for the zonal-mean meridional flow should invoke
the zonal-mean zonal pressure gradient—the pressure difference between eastern and western
boundaries—just as it showed up in the closure problem (2.1) of the two-dimensional models! Perhaps because this problem had become the above-mentioned obsession for me, I was struck by
the fact that paper upon paper repeated the scaling (3.4) without being bothered by the apparent
violation of geostrophy and thus Newton’s second law. A close colleague once characterized this
gap in reasoning as minor. I felt, however, that at a minimum we ought to make explicit the
working hypothesis of the zonal pressure gradient scaling linearly with the meridional pressure
gradient, a point clearly acknowledged by Bryan [23] but not by many followers.
