196 MR. NEWPORT ON THE IMPREGNATION OP

attended to, and I noticed a curious fact which I first remarked in experiments in
1849. - It is what I may designate partial impregnation, and is indicated by a por-
tion only of the yelk becoming segmented. This frequently happens with ova that
bave been brought into contact with only very small quantities of seminal fluid, and
but for short spaces of time, as in some of the following experiments. These ova,
80 far as I have observed, never produce embryos. Segmentation is arrested in 8ome
at the very commencement (Plate XIV. fig. 11), in others it goes on to the second or
crucial fissure, and in a very few cases may proceed somewhat further (fig. 12), but is
never completed to granulation of the yelk. This, I think, is a fact which deserves
some consideration with reference to the formation of the embryo.

Set F. March 22, 1850.â€”Temperature of the room at the time of the experiment
was 48*5 Fanr., and that of the water employed 46*5 Fanr. As the proof of impreg-
nation is the segmentation of the yelk, and as my object now was to observe the effect
of small quantities of impregnating fluid applied only for very short periods of time
at a low temperature of the surrounding medium, it is not of consequence that this set
was not, watched to the full development of the embryo. To show the degree of sus-
ceptibility of the ovum under the combined influence of these cireumstances, it was
suflicient to attempt the impregnation at a low temperature, and after the lapse of an
interval to remove the ova to a room of the same, or nearly the same temperature as
in the set E. This was done at the end of one hour and a half.
