The shell-like orbital or ascending part of the palatines meets the hinder part
of the main vomer (v.), almost reaching as far backwards as its four terminal prongs. The small pterygoids ( pg.) also ascend, and below, where they are spliced obliquely Lo
the palatine wall of the great nasopalatine canal, they end, behind, in the hamular
process, which is small, flat, and turned outwards ; it is supported, outside, by
the equally small external pterygoid process (e.pg.). The pterygoid is very small, as
in the Marsupials, and this comes from the fact that what is generally, in the higher
mammals, the upper or basicranial flange, is here, as in the Marsupials, a long, tongue-
shaped mesopterygoid (ms.pg.). This flat bone is sharp in front, where it wedges in

between the palatine and pterygoid, and blunt behind, where it partly hides the basi-
sphenoid (b.s.) ; its front part hides the side of the presphenoid (p.s.); it is gently
arcuate, the convex side being towards the mid-line.
