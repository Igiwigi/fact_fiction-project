Thus, on plot 10, where the supply of potass was discontinued, the tendency to
form stem has gradually, and a length very greatly, diminished ; the herbage has come
to consist in a much larger proportion of leaf; it maintains a darker green colour,
does not eventually ripen as on plot 9, and is altogether more patchy and uneven,
The chemical examination of the produce shows that, with these characters, 8b-
stantially the same amount of nitrogen continues to be taken up, on plot 10 with the
discontinued supply of potass and the diminished and deficiently matured produce, as
on plot 9. On the other hand, the amount of potass taken up has, in the later years,
been only about one-third as much on plot 10 as on plot 9. We have here again,
then, 80 far as the nitrogen taken up is concerned, and also the abundance of
chlorophyll formed, as indicated by the colour of the herbage, in a sense, potential
growth. But, with the deficient supply of potass, there is deficient stem-formation
and immaturity ; in fact, deficient produce ; in other words, deficient carbon-assimila-
tion. Nor did the increased supply of soda compensate for the deficiency of potass,
80 far as these characters of growth are concerned.

From the various facts adduced, it is evident that it was the want of a liberal
available supply of potass that restricted the growth on plot 4-2, with the ammonia-
salts and superphosphate of lime, and on plot 10 with the ammonia-salts, snper-
phosphate of lime, and a liberal supply of soda and magnesia, but only a partial one
of potass ; indeed, the agricultural, the botanical, and so far the chemical results,
concur in showing how essential is a liberal provision of potass for the full effect of
the nitrogen which was at the same time supplied. The comparison of the results
obtained on plots 7 and 8, the one with the mixed mineral manure each year, including
potass, and the other with the potass discontinued after the firs few years (as on
