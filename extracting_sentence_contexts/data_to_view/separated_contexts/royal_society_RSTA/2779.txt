Paired metamorphic belts (assemblages of low temperature, high pressure metamorphic rocks 22
and low pressure, high temperature rocks) are thought to be indicative of subduction, as they are [4

Finally, mantle chemical heterogeneity formed during the first few hundred million years of the
Earth history persists in the mantle for approximately 1-2 Gyr (e.g. [153,154]). Such long mixing
times are difficult to explain with simple models of early Earth plate tectonics, where a hot mantle
is expected to result in vigorous convection and rapid mantle mixing [154,155]. In fact, early
formed heterogeneity is even seen in modern rocks thought to be sourced from the large low
shear velocity provinces (LLSVPs) in the lower mantle [156-159]. As the LLSVPs are typically
hypothesized to be chemically dense, and thus resistant to mixing with the rest of the mantle
(e.g. [160]), heterogeneity sourced from these regions probably does not constrain the efficiency
of mantle mixing. However, the Archean rocks showing resolvable signatures of early formed
heterogeneity do not show evidence of being sourced from LLSVPs, so they likely do constrain
the efficiency of ancient mantle mixing.
