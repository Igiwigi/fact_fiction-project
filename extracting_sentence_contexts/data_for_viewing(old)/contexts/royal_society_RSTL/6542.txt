This elegant sculpture can only be made out by the aid of a lens or microscope.

They are very much like the seeds of Nymphea alba, especially the form with the larger
seeds, the Nymphaea alba melocarpa, Casp. In the recent seeds the longitudinal strize
appear much less distinct ; but in such seeds as are found in the * Pfablbanten' of

Q RoBENHAUSEN, they look exactly like those of the fossil species. In these also the
Hole on the top of the seed is somewhat more widened, as in the fossil species. As to
5 the shape, the latter differs in s far as the seeds are comparatively somewhat wider
by (those of I. alba melocarps are 33 millims. long and 2 millims. wide): this more con-
= 8iderable breadth may have been caused by pressure, since they are all highly com-
=D pressed. To the same circumstance we may ascribe the fact that the raphe cannot be
= pointed out distinctly.

= The seeds of Bovey are very like those of my Nymphea Charpentieri (Flora Tertiaria,
- iti. p. 195, pl. 155. fig. 20 6, c), the latter being only s0mewhat narrower. It would
= therefore be very desirable that the leaves be sought for at Boyey, since from these
S alone can it be decided with certainty whether this species is really distinct from
> N. Charpentieri, to which it comes very near, The seeds of the living Nymphew are
= yariable in their dimensions.
