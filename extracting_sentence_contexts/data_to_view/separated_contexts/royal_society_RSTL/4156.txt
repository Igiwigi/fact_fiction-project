The analysis also of the unsaponified cerin agreed closely with that
of the acid as separated from the baryta salt, and the melting-points only differed by
four or five degrees Centigrade. Further experiment showed me that the same cerin,
when boiled with caustic baryta, entered with the greatest facility into combination
with that substance. These facts led me to suspect that the formation of the unsa-
ponifiable body was due to the presence of a certain portion of the other substances
of the wax, and was no true product of the decomposition of the cerin itself ; but
that this substance was in truth no other than the acid itself existing, in a free state,
in the wax. The experiments which follow are inconsistent with any other hypothesis. To prepare this acid bees'-wax is to be boiled out with strong alcohol, and the hot
s0]ution poured off from the undissolved residue.
