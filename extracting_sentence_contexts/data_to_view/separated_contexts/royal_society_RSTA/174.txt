Any calculation of macroscopic features needs, technically speaking, a certain
degree of compactification and, often, the application of effective medium theories
and the like (Milton 2002). Surface relaxations have been analysed and were found to be virtually
independent of the concrete atomic potentials. All that matters is the fact that
he second- and higher-order interactions are cut in any half space (figure 1). Any energy minimization of the remaining interactions leads to a series of
differential equations with solutions of the type ¢, =A”e9, where &, is the nth
ayer relaxation amplitude (strain), In A is the length scale of the relaxation and é9
is the relaxation amplitude of the outermost layer. All structural relaxations have,
hus, exponential envelopes and phase factors that are either +1 (ferroelastic),
—1 (antiferroelastic), or exp(i¢) (incommensurate).
