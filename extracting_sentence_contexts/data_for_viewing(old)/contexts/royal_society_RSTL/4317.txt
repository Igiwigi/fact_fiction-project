among the larger islands to the west of it, the tide is only about two feet. But
moreover at some at least of these places the tide, small as it is, is not the /unar tide
following its ordinary laws. At Tahiti, for instance, the time of high water appears
never to deviate from noon by more than a certain difference, although Sir E. Ber-
cHER has Shown that it varies from about nine o'clock in the forenoon to three in the
afternoon*, At Bow Island there appears reason to believe that the limits are much
the same, and perhaps at Carteret's harbour in New Ireland. Now it will easily be
scen that such a result as this would follow, if we were to suppose the tidal influence
of the sun and of the moon to be equal. On this supposition, it is plain that the
high water would always occur half-way between the sun's transit and the moon's
transit. Hence at new moon the high water would be at noon; as the moon went
away to the eastward of the sun, the tide would be later and smaller ; till, when the
moon was at, 6" distance from the sun, the tide would be at 3"; but would in fact
vanish. After this point, the tide would reappear at 9* a.w., or a little later, the
inferior transit of the moon now taking the place of the superior one, in determining
the tide ; and from this time the tide would be gradually later and larger, till, at full
moon, it would again be at noon ; and 80 on. This appears to agree pretty well with
the phenomena of the tides at Tahiti, as determined by Sir E. BeLcnes.,

35. A more minute examination of the tides in these regions will enable us to
pronounce more decidedly whether the law of the phenomena is that which has been
just stated. And if it appear that the phenomena do follow this law, we sball have
further to consider how such a motion of the sea in those parts is to be combined
with the very different movements which occur in other places, and what is the
general movement of the ocean which they indicate; whether, for instance, they are
