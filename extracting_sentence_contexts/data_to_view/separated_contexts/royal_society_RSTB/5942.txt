A short distance
in front of the head-process, the endoderm is thickened to form what Husrecur
recognises as the “* protochordale Platte (in erster Anlage).””

Husrecut (’07, p. 38) states that in blastocysts 55 and 192, and to a less marked
extent in blastocyst 209, there is evidence of the formation of extra-embryonal mesoderm
directly from the endoderm and concludes on the basis of his observations that there
is present in Nycticebus as in Sorex and Tarsius a peripheral zone where blood-vessels
and blood originate from cells proliferated from the endoderm. I have examined
all the blastocysts mentioned in regard to this point and must confess I have failed
to find any evidence of vasifactive activity on the part of the endoderm. As a matter
of fact, in a presomite embryo of Loris 49 in which the embryonal area measures 1-92
x 1-25 mm. and the primitive streak about 0-76 mm. and in which the head-process
has already given origin in its caudal half, to a chorda plate, blood-islands are only just
appearing in the trilaminar extra-embryonal region of the blastocyst-wall, adjoining
the embryonal area.
