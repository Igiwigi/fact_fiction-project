When, moreover, a concaye mirror received a parallel beam which had
traversed the tube, and returned it into the vapour in a high state of luminous concen-
tration, the light was ineffectual. The passage of the beam through a comparatively
small depth of the vapour appeared to extract from it those constituents which produced
decomposition. That the vapour was present at the distant end of the tube, was proved
by the fact that both with the sun and with the electric light the reversal of the tube
instantly brought down a heavy cloud. As regards the chemical rays nitrite of amyl is
the Vackest substance that I have yet encountered. It rapidly extinguishes them,
leaving behind a beam of sensibly undiminished photometric intensity, but powerless as
a chemical agent as far as the nitrite is concerned.
