solution of sugar alone howeyer was used, the influence of the
tin and lead became sensible, the predominant radiation being
from the positive pole; a feeble counter-current being, how=
ever, observed from the negative.

41. The contact of the positive pole, in like manner, com-
municates peculiar properties to mercury, but less strongly
marked, and which appear to depend, in part, on the film of
oxide formed on its surface, and partly on an absorption of
oxygen by the metal itself; a thing rendered not improbable
by the analogy of silver and other metals, which when fused
in contact with air, absorb oxygen without losing their me-
tallic appearance. The facts I have observed are chiefly
these :

42. Equal quantities of mercury were electrified for equal
times in two separate capsules, under similar solutions of
carbonate of soda, one in contact with the negative wire, and
the other with the positive. On mixing them together, the
mercury was acted on as if pure, and showed no signs of


fluid conductors when transmitting the electric current, 187

containing sodium. Here, the mercury in contact with the
