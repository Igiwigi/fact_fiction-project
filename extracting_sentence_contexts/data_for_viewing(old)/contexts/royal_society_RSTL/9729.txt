was no sudden or discontinuous change marking the exact epoch of its disappearance,

of its existence at the moment when it ceased to be visible.

These experiments, which could be multiplied to any extent, show that, ph
rescence can be produced in tubes of all degrees of exhaust by sufficiently int a3
the violence of the negative discharge. But there is an experimental fact which has
been repeatedly observed and should be mentioned here, which shows that it is bw
essential that there should be any increased violence of the whole discharge, but that |
a sufficient intensification of the local action at the negative terminal is all that, is
necessary. When a tube is being exhausted to a high vacuum the phosphorescencs.
always appears firs in the neigbourhood of the negative terminal. But it often.
happens that one of the terminals of the tube is much smaller than the other. In
snch cases there is invariably a stage in the exhaust in which Phosphorescence is
visible when the smaller terminal is the negative terminal, but in which no Phospho-
rescence appears when the current is reversed. And similarly when there is il
inequality of size in the terminals, a smaller air-spark will suffice to produce phospho-
rescence when the smaller terminal is negative than when it is positive. Now it, is
well known that negative discharge is greatly facilitated by increasing the size of the
