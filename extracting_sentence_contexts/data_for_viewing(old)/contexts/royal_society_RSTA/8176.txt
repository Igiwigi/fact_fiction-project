in terms of the wave-length of light. The new apparatus is so designed that measure-
ments may be made either in air under controlled conditions or in vacuum. It therefore
affords ready means for making the new determinations of refractive index which will
in any case be needed before a wave-length definition of the unit of length can be
finally adopted, since practical every-day measurements cannot conveniently be made
in vacuum, and optical measurements of length are already beginning to enter into
routine work even in industrial establishments. It also affords means for investigating
the possibility of defining the ultimate standard of length by reference to wave-lengths
in vacuum and so eliminating atmospheric corrections entirely from the fundamental
definition.

The wave-length in vacuum is obviously ideal as a definition because it is easily
reproducible under modern conditions of vacuum technique, and because it is, in fact,
a truly natural constant. But it may be thought that it might lead to difficulties
when applied to the interpretation of direct measurements of lengths which, for practical
purposes, may necessarily have to be made in air. A striking example of an apparently
similar kind is the definition of the Prototype Metre at the temperature of 0° C., which

was accepted because of its ideal characteristic of reproducibility before the difficulties
inherent in making practical every-day measurements at this temperature were
