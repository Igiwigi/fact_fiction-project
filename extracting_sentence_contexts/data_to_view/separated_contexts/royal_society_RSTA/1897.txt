The Poisson equation is the partial differential equation. From which, the electrical
field can be derived [18,19,22,23,27]

where W is the electric potential, pz is the volumetric charge density and ¢ is the dielectric constant
of the material. To solve the Poison equation with the LBM, a fictive time-dependent term is added
and the equation becomes

Introducing a parameter x, which depends on the dielectric constant of the material, different
dielectric material can be simulated. The evolution equation for equation (2.8) in a D2Q9 LBM
can be written as

The distribution of electric field, E, can be computed either via the finite-difference discretization
method [28] or directly via the distribution functions [29,30]. Here, the isotropic finite-difference
discretization method is applied

(c) Lattice Boltzmann method for the electrokinetic concentration field

Advection—diffusion equation (2.13) and Nernst-Planck equations (2.14) and (2.15) are used to
describe the electrokenitic concentration field, C(x, f) [22,31,32]
