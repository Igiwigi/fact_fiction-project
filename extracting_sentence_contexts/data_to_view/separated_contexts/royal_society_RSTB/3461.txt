as the forward continuation known as the “ head-process,” with the well-developed,
and often massive and laminated, archenteron of the Reptilia. We have seen in the
present paper how striking is the resemblance between the archenteron of Ornitho-

what we have termed the protosomites are in fact derivatives, en masse, from the
archenteric knot ; and that the cavities, actual or potential, found in their interior are
always representatives, or remains, of that originally wide transverse archenteric
lumen so well seen in our fig. 44, Plate 9. Comparison of the foregoing account of v. Spexz’s observations with our statements
