3 ~The relations between the amounts of expansion along the directions of the other
® two crystallographical axes, a and c, are much more complicated, and are evidently
i influenced by the replacement of one metal by another. Considering the coefficients
A of expansion for 0°, the amount of expansion along the direction of the axis ¢ is the
greater in the case of both the potassium and cesium salts ; and for all three salts the
increment is, as already indicated, greater for this than for any other direction. But
in the case of the rubidium salt a remarkable excess of expansion is observed to occur
along the direction of the @ axis, which is the maximum thermal axis at 0°, at the
expense of that along the ¢ axis, which becomes reduced to the intermediate thermal
axis. The increments per degree, however, for these two directions in the rubidium
salt, remain of the same order as for the other two salts. Now it is an interesting
fact, and doubtless not without significance, that the directions of maximum thermal
effect coincide with those of the first median line of the optic axial angles of all three

case of the rubidium salt. In order to follow the parallelism further, it will be
necessary to compare the linear coefficients of expansion for higher temperatures, the
values for 50° and 100° suilicing for the purpose. In the following table are given
the values of a = a@ + 2bt for 0°, 50° and 100°. The directions are also indicated. of
