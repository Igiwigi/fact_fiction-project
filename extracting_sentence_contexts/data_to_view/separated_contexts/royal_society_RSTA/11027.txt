A copper w.re, for example,
becomes incrusted with oxide in a region where yellow light is abundantly emitted
from a salted flame. A superoxygenated oxy-hydrogen flame is also coloured
yellow by salt. In discussing these facts* one of us was led to consider whether an alternative
explanation might not be sought from some conclusions, derived by Professor
ARRHENTUS, from a study of the electrical conductivity of salt vapours in flames.t
