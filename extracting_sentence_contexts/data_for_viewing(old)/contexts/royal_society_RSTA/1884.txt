the development of theory and embodies the properties attributed to the dictionary definition
of theory, so there is sufficient basis for comparing what the periodic table and the theory of
evolution have in common.

While there are many parallels between the two, one key difference is that chemistry was
a large, well-established discipline before the discovery of the periodic table and evolutionary
biology was not. The periodic table is a significant signpost on the road to our understanding
the structure of matter. The Origin of Species had some precedents but it was not embedded in a
continuous, well-developed chain of progress in the same fashion as the periodic table. It was a
new beginning and Darwin can be credited with giving birth to a new discipline.

The facts that preceded the discovery of the periodic table were the discovery of 63 of the
elements, their physical characterization, including the estimation of their atomic weights, and
the finding that there were patterns in which elements reacted with one another and they did so
in regular proportions—e.g. two volumes of hydrogen reacted with one of oxygen. Sometimes
elements that were very different in atomic weight, such as carbon and silicon, were very similar
in the way they reacted with other elements, leading to earlier proposals for the existence of
groups of elements with similar chemical properties [1].

Dimitri Mendeleev was writing a textbook on chemistry when he sought some organizing
principles for these facts. His efforts were distinguished by his emphasis on using atomic weight
as the criteria for ordering the elements and his commanding knowledge of ‘the natural history
of the elements’ [1, p. 138]. The columns of his table, or groups, included elements that were
similar in chemical properties but with a progressive increase in atomic weight from the top to
