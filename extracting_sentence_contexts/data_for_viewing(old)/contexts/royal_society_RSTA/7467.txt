non-vanishing cross-terms in the ellipsoid representation, and crystal symmetry would then
automatically require the ellipsoids to be in pairs, leading to pairs of values of, f of the type

oc (m, cos? y +m, sin? y+meg cos y sin f)}.

No scheme of this kind, however, can fit the facts in detail, since it would involve two periods
which become exactly equal for y= 0 or 47, while extrapolation suggests that the two periods
for the field nearly along the c-axis will not in fact become equal for the field exactly along
the c-axis. It should be noticed too that the experimentally determined value of E, for the
field along the c-axis and for the field along the a- or b-axes are quite different (see table 2),
so it is probable that the ellipsoids involved are unrelated by symmetry. The departure of
the points from the main straight line of figure 5 as the field turns nearly into the a-axis is
greater than can be ascribed to experimental error, and even though the E, values close to
the a- and b-axes are approximately equal, here too it is probable that independent ellip-
soids are involved. It is worth pointing out that the variation of amplitude with y serves
as a useful guide in relating particular periods to particular ellipsoids. Thus in the ab-plane
it is plausible to suppose that as y passes through the range of 20 to 30Â° the effects of one
ellipsoid fade out and the effects of the other take over. The whole situation is further com-
plicated by the various new periods which show up only at the lowest temperatures, and it
is evident that considerable effort, with measurements at much closer intervals of 7, will
