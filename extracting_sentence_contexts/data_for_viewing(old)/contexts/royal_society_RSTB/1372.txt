the experimental side also, as will be seen, these differences are further brought out.

Part I[].—Resvutts oF ABSINTHE STIMULATION.

Having, in Parts I. and II., had the opportunity of briefly comparing the facts of the
functional and anatomical changes which result from a series of ablations of cerebral
substance, it now remains to briefly record the results elicited by stimulation of the
remaining nerve substance.

a Mode of Research.—The stimulant employed has been in every case Absinthe,
‘Which, as is well known, from the researches of MArtr, MAGNAN, Horstry, and
ORSLEY and GorcH, acts as a powerful cerebral excitant. In the cat and dog
jection of a few minims of this agent produces a series of fits, showing a scriking
vresemblance to those seen in epilepsy. The fit commences in about 30 secs. after the
Snjection of the absinthe, and is manifested by twitchings of the muscles of the eye,
