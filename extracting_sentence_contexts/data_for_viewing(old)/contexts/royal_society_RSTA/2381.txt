the structure of eHDA"” is stable at 119K for almost 2h, while at 121K it starts transforming -

within the timescale of 1h, and at 123 K within 480 s. These results are consistent with isothermal
dielectric measurements [40] investigating the transformation kinetics of eHDA. For 123K, the
dielectric measurements [40] derive a timescale of 104 s for the conversion, and a slightly larger
value for 121K. An exponential fit to the X-ray data calculated a time constant of t=9810 s
and is therefore consistent with the dielectric measurements [40]. The timescales at the other
temperatures are difficult to compare, because here measurements at times longer than t > 104
s were not conducted, and both eHDA samples at 119 and 121K did not fully transform to
LDA within that time frame. Slight deviations can have different reasons, as thermal contact
or simply the fact that all X-ray measurements on these samples have been done at the same
sample position. Additionally, we demonstrated that these powder-samples exhibit macroscopic
heterogeneities and different points within the sample can transform on a slightly different
timescale.

The different crystallization behaviour of LDA-I and LDA-II was investigated previously
in the literature. Neutron scattering experiments [44] indicated a higher thermal stability
of LDA-II compared with LDA-I and calorimetric measurements show small differences in
the enthalpy of crystallization. The X-ray diffraction data, presented here, show the same
crystallization behaviour of LDA as previously discussed by Seidl ef al. [55] as parallel versus
single crystallization kinetics. That is, LDA-I derived from uHDA crystalizes into hexagonal ice,
whereas LDA-II derived from eHDA crystallizes to stacking disordered ice (or also commonly
denoted cubic ice) [49-52], and they concluded that uHDA contains crystalline hexagonal
