The approach based on It6’s formula extends to
evolution families, but has the general drawback that it does not seem to give the optimal growth
rate O(,/p) of the constant as expected from the Burkholder—Davis—Gundy inequalities as p > oo. As discussed in §4b, for Cp-contraction semigroups on Hilbert spaces a new proof of the maximal
inequality for exponents 0 < p < oo giving growth of order O(,/p) was obtained by Hausenblas &
Seidler [39]. The approach via It6’s formula was once more revisited in [60], where it was finally extended
to arbitrary 2-smooth Banach spaces by exploiting the fact that, in such spaces, for 2 < p < 00
the mapping xt> ||x||? is once continuously Fréchet differentiable with a Lipschitz continuous
derivative. As it turns out, this already suffices to prove a version of the It6 formula with the
help of which the argument can be completed. This approach, however, does not seem to give the
optimal p-dependence of the constant as p — oo.

(b) The It6 formula approach revisited

The aim of the present subsection is to present the It6 formula approach to maximal estimates
for stochastic convolutions.
