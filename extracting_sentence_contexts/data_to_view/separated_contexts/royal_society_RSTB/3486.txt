But the mesoderm so contributed to the broad
paraxial zone is trifling in amount, nor has this protosomitic segmentation any
recognisable relation to the definitive somitic segmentation, numerical or other. Our employment of the term “ protosomite” really indicates our belief that the
structures so designated are morphologically equivalent to palingenetic somites
of direct archenteric origin, differentiated in and from the lateral walls of the

gastrula, and eventually incorporated in the general mesoderm. On the other hand,
it is one of the chief results of the investigation recorded in this paper to establish
the fact that in Ornithorhynchus the main mass of the general mesoderm, both
parietal and paraxial, comes into existence wholly independently of the activity
of the gastrular or archenteric walls. The incorporation in the somitic segments
of the former, of the quite insignificant protosomitic derivatives of the latter,
is therefore a union of structural elements which are homoplastic rather than
homogenetic. And we are thus led up to the conception of a distinction between
palingenetic and cenogenetic mesoderm which is precisely parallel to that often
recognised between palingenetic and cenogenetic entoderm.
