In the first part of this paper I have described in full the sections made through
several leading types of Astreidw and Fungide (cf pp. 127-189). It is therefore
unnecessary for me to repeat here the details of the microscopic structure charac-
teristic of these two large families of Madreporaria. The important fact is that
these younger families agree with the Paleozoic Cyathopbyllids in the essential
features of trabecular structure, and in the position of the apices of trabeculi at the
upper edge of the septum, Some of these younger types have precisely the same
distribution of trabecule in the septum as the older types. Others again have a
more elaborate system. Instead of having only one area of divergence in the
septum from which trabeculae fan out to the right and left and vertically upwards,
these elaborate forms have several such areas (cf. figs.
