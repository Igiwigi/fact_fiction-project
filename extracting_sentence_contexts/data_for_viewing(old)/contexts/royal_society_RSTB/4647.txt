INTRODUCTION.

It is now a well-known fact that every Flat-fish begins life with the eyes in the
normal position ; the asymmetry of its skull is not born with it, but acquired during
the early development. The conversion of a normal fish is thus a constant occurrence,
year by year, and we should be able to determine the causes of the phenomenon.
The normal condition may be taken for granted ; the abnormal requires explanation,

The adult asymmetry of a few forms is also known, but the descriptions are
imperfect or incomplete. Each part has an asymmetry of its own, it is said; the
frontals display torsion, the eyes have somehow come to one side of the head and the
other parts have somehow altered and fitted themselves into the new conditions. No
attempt has been made to correlate the changes in the different parts.
