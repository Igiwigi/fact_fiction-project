For this purpose it is necessary to confine
attention to curves of which the first four moments are finite ; further, if the accuracy
of the fourth moment should increase with the size of the sample, that is, if its probable
error should not be infinitely great, the first eight moments must be finite. This
restriction requires that the class of distribution in which this condition is not fulfilled
should be set aside as “ heterotypic,” and that the fourth moment should become
practically valueless as this class is approached. It should be made clear, however,
that there is nothing anomalous about these so-called “ heterotypic ” distributions
except the fact that the method of moments cannot be applied to them. More-
over, for that class of distribution to which the method can be applied, it has not
been shown, except in the case of the normal curve, that the best values will be
obtained by the method of moments. ‘The method will, in these cases, certainly be
serviceable in yielding an approximation, but to discover whether this approximation
is a good or a bad one, and to improve it, if necessary, a more adequate criterion is
required.
