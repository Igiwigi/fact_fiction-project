out being augmented in bulk, Mr. Eller, from-his
experiments, concludes, that eight ounces of water
will abſorb one drachm and a half;” or above a 4.2d
part of its weight of nitre ; and hence I ſuppoled
the, quantity of , water which, I, uſed, would. have
abforbed, above ſixteen, times as, much,-or! above 3
ounces ;. "whereas the event ſhewed that.it, could not

water during the ſolution, I was at firſt. inclined. to '
believe that ſome part at leaſt of the nitre was taken
into the pores of the water : in order.to ſee whether
this conjecture could be verified by fact, I made the
following experiment.

EXPERIMENT II.

I choſe two mattraſſes of unequal ſizes, contain-
ing quantities of water in the proportion, of 12 to 1,
the diameters of the necks being . equal: into the
largeſt I put ,,th part of the, water's weight of
nitre, and an equal quantity into.the ſmaller ; and I
obſerved that the water, as well before as after the
folution, was equally elevated in_them both: this
experiment was repeated, Now, if a given quantity
