We conclude from examination of sections, very clearly in the case
iBipteris, though with less clear demonstration in the more complex case of
H@n, that the synangium is a product of the adaxial surface of the sporangio-
and that it arises immediately below the organic apex of that part. These
Srengthen the conclusion already drawn by Soums from external observation,

» whole sporangiophore is a member of foliar nature, and that it is not com-
a shortened axis and leaves, as Juranryi suggested. I would add that,
f the synangium had proved to be terminal, there would be no need to have
se to so cumbrous, and I think improbable, an explanation of the fact, for to me
®is just as probable that a synangium may occupy the apex of a leaf, as that a
Bsium may be found at the apex of an axis; in this case the terminal or lateral
sn of the synangium would not affect the argument. This seems to have been
few of PRANTL also. he lateral position of the synangium being demonstrated, and the conclusion
d at that the whole sporangiophore is a foliar structure, it remains to draw
risons with other plants, and in the first place with those to which the affinity
Psilotacese has always been recognized, viz., the Lycopodiaceee.
