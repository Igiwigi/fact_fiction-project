47—Use of the Compensated geoid. To avoid difficulties of matter external to the
geoid, some form of compensation must be employed. This is merely a mathe-
matical artifice and does not involve any faith in the actuality of the adopted form of
compensation. The combined effects of any matter external to the geoid and ofan
equivalent amount of matter inside the geoid—distributed as we like—is calculated ;
both on the value of gravity at any point and on the height of the geoid. The result
is a set of compensated values of gravity which is responsible for the form of the
compensated geoid.

The separation of geoid and compensated geoid is easily calculated when the
topography is known.* The reduction of gravity observations, including compen-
sation according to the Hayrorp hypothesis, is well understood. The fact that
many gravity results have already been so reduced makes it convenient to adopt this
form of compensation. For the present purpose, in addition a height correction
for the amount of separation of the geoid (from which heights of pendulum stations
are ordinarily given) and compensated geoid is required ; for our data are to be
applied to the compensated geoid. The height correction in all cases may be derived
best by means of equation (17.4)

We have tacitly assumed hitherto that the compensation correction will remove
all effects of matter external to the real geoid ; but we now require that the same
be true of the compensated geoid. Whether this is true or not depends on the nature
of the compensation. If for each external particle, at height h above the geoid, we
assumed an equal negative compensatory particle at depth h below the geoid, then
