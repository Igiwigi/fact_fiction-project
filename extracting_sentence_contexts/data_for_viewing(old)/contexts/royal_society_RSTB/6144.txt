The measurement of spiral inclination in the polarizing microscope presented
more difficulty. In general no indication is given, visible under an ordinary
microscope, of the direction of the cellulose fibrils in the wall. Now even a very
thin section can, in general, contain only walls of a three-ply nature, the cellulose
walls of two neighbouring cells being separated by some material possibly of a pectic
nature. Thus the extinction positions already referred to lie along the bisectors of
the angle between those of the individual walls, and no information can be obtained
as to the extinction positions of the individual walls ; in fact, no true extinction is
obtained in any position of the microscope stage. When the two cells have the same
spiral sign the cellulose chains run in opposite directions in the two walls, and the
extinction positions are approximately parallel and perpendicular to the length of
the cell. Any such section does, in fact, show a few single walls as indicated by their
more perfect extinction and by the inclination of their extinction positions, but the
number is far too small for present purposes. Hence the wood must be macerated.
For exactly the same reason the cells, when macerated, must be cut open in order to
leave a single wall for observation. Several methods were tried for carrying out
this operation, and finally the following was adopted. A suspension of macerated
cells, obtained as described above, was allowed to flow over a slide previously
thoroughly cleaned in alcohol and covered with a thin layer of albumen fixative,
applied by means of a finger covered with a rubber fingerette. The water was
evaporated at 30° C, the glycerine of the fixative removed by alcohol, and the slides
replaced in the oven until the fixative was hard. The slides were then “ shaved ”
with a sharp microtome knife. The majority of the tracheids were lying parallel
to the surface of the slide, either on their tangential or their radial faces, so that
