Though it
and the Arran plant possess several features in common, I cannot identify them with
sufficient definiteness to assign the same name to both. This, however, is of no
consequence for the present, since I have not yet given any name to the Arran plant. Rather more important is the fact that M. Renauur speaks of a stem having a solid
vascular axis, like that of Lepidodendron Spenceri, to which stem he has given the
name of L. Rhodumnense. The following description shows that it has some features
in common with my plant :—La cavité centrale, due soit & un déchirement du tissu,
soit 4 ce que le procambium n’a pas achevé sa lignification, est cylindrique, dans les
échantillons non déformés, toujours de dimension extrémement réduite, et ne présentant
que des traces douteuses de tissu cellulaire.t Details in the structure of the cortex
of L. Rhodumnense indicate a specific difference between it and my plant. The Lepidodendron intermedium, figs. 16, 17, and 18, has a special interest when
viewed in connection with the plant which I some time ago named Lepidodendron
Suliginosum.{
