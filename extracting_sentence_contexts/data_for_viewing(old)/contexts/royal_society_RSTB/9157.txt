Reo- and caliciviruses are quite distinct classes of viruses.
The Orthoreovirinae are large proteinaceous double-stranded
RNA containing viruses with a complex multi-layered
capsid. Protruding from each fivefold vertex are trimeric
fibres of the attachment protein o-1 that terminate in a globu-

lar knob domain comprising three beta-barrels. Evolution of
