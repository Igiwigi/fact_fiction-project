8ingle voltaic circuit, or of WoLLasroN's powerful single pair of metals. This diffi-
culty has arisen altogether from the antagonism of the chemical aflinity engaged in
producing the current with the chemical affinity to be overcome, and depends entirely
upon their relative intensity ; for when the 8um of forces in one has a certain degree
of superiority over the 8um of forces in the other, the former gains the ascendancy,
determines the current, and overcomes the latter forces s0 as to make the substance
exerting them yield up its elements in perfect accordance, both as to direction and
quantity, with the course of those which are exerting the most intense action.

898. Water has generally been the substance, the decompoxsition of which has been
sought for as a chemical test of the passage of an electric current. But I now began
to perceive a reason for its failure, and for a fact which I had obseryed long before
(315. 316.) with regard to the iodide of potassium, namely, that bodies would differ *
in facility of decomposition by a given electric current, according to the condition
and intensity of their ordinary chemical affinities. This reason appeared in their
reaction back upon the affinities tending to cause the current; and it appeared pro-
bable, that many substances might be found which could be decomposed by the cur-
rent of a single pair of zine and platina plates immersed in dilate sulphuric acid,
although water resisted its action. I soon found this to be the case, and as the expe-
riments offer new and beautiful proofs of the direct relation and oppoxsition of the
chemical affinities concerned in producing and in resisting the stream of electricity, I
shall briefly describe them.
