DISTRIBUTION IN THE ATMOSPHERE OVER ENGLAND. 267

It will be seen from these tables that the average maximum height reached is
greater in summer than in winter. This is partly due to the fact that the bursting-
point of a balloon depends on the pressure, and in summer a greater height must be
reached to attain the same low pressure. This does not account for the whole
variation, and the part left must be ascribed to the effect of temperature on india-
rubber. It becomes hard if left unused in cold weather. For reaching great heights
the quality of the rubber is of supreme importance.

The figures in column B are instructive. Large inversions of temperature are to be
met with at the commencement of the isothermal in summer rather than in winter ;
and at times when the barometer is near its normal value, and not when it is low.

The figures in column C are not what would be expected. The surface wind in
