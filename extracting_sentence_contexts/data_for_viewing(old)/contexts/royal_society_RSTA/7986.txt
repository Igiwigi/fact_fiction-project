been made on the effect of NO, on the ignition of hydrogen and oxygen mixtures
(and of NH, and C,N,) and on methane and oxygen mixtures seem also to indicate
that the behaviour of NO, cannot simply be the result of the production of more
O atoms. Further investigation is here necessary; it is quite possible, for instance,
that NO, might increase “ knock” with methane as fuel, for the conditions could be
made more drastic and more primitive radicals (OH, etc.) would then be in control.
Nevertheless the fact that NO, by itself does not cause “ knock,” while OR radicals
from organic nitrites and nitrates (e.g. ethyl nitrite and ethyl nitrate) do, is of interest,
for it shows that the production of chain carriers as oxygen atoms is not the cause
of the ignition phenomenon involved in “ knock.”
SN With hydrogen, however, nitrogen peroxide acts as a strong “ pro-knock” ; in fact
% « knock ” with this fuel is almost certainly due to NO, formed from the nitrogen of the
Bair, for such inhibitors as lead tetraethyl had no effect in stopping it. Diethyl-
2 peroxide also did not give rise to “ knock” and amyl nitrite only in a very minor
@ degree. Although the temperature conditions for ignition are somewhat different,
‘© these observations indicate that it is the intrinsic nature of the chain reactions in the
g “ presensitization ”’ period, which is the important point and not only the disrupti-
EB) bility of the sensitizer. -
