In the experiments which I had made, I had, as I then imagined,
guarded as much as possible- against every source of error and
deception. The bottles being of the same size, neither any occa-
Sional alteration in the pressure of the atmosphere during the
experiment, nor the necessary and unavoidable difference in the
densities of the air in the hot and in the cold rooms in which they
were weighed, could affect their apparent weights; and their

remained for such a considerable length of time in the heat and
cold to which they were exposed, I flattered myself that the
quantities of moisture remaining attached to their surfaces,
could not be $0 different as sensibly to effect the results of the
experiments.—But, in regard to this last circumstance, I after-
wards found reason to conclude that my opinion was erroneous. Admitting the fact stated by Dr. Foxpyce,—(and which my
experiments had hitherto rather tended to corroborate than to
contradict,)—l1 could not conceive any other cause for the aug-
mentation of the apparent weight of water, upon its being frozen,
than the loss of $0 great a proportion of its latent heat as that
fluid is known to evolve when it congeals; and I concluded, that
if the loss of latent heat added to the weight of one body, it must
of necessity produce the same effect on another, and consequent-
ly, that the augmentation of the quantity of latent heat must,—
in all bodies, —and in all cases, —diminish their apparent weights. To determine whether this is actually the case or not, I made
the following experiment. Having provided two bottles, as nearly alike as possible, and in
all respects similar to those made use of in the experiments above-
mentioned, into one of them I put 4012,46 grains of water, and
into the other an equal weight of mercury; and, sealing them her-
metically, and suspending them to the arms of the balance, I
suffered them to acquire the temperature of my room, 61*; then,
bringing them into a perfect equilibrium with each other, I re-
moved them into a room in which the air was at the tempera-
ture of g4*, where they remained twenty-four hours.—But there
was not the least appearance of either of them acquiring, or
losing, any weight.
