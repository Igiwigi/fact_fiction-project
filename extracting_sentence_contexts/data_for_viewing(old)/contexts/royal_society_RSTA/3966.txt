material table S2). Therefore, while the enzyme can significantly reduce the activation-free energy
compared with the water reaction, presumably by generating a hydroxide nucleophile on the
catalytic metal centre, the enzymatic deprotonation of water as a nucleophile (in the presence
of metal ions) still does not allow the enzyme-catalysed reaction to match the hydroxide reaction.
It increases our confidence in our calculations that we can quantitatively reproduce this difference
(see the detailed methodology section in the electronic supplementary material information for
further details of the calibration of our EVB calculations).

Additionally, as with paraoxon hydrolysis, the transition states are geometrically similar with
all five metal ions with only slight differences in the C-Ojg distances to the leaving group, and
the metal-metal distances follow a similar trend to that observed in the case of paraoxon (see
table 1 for a distance overview). The biggest geometric change between the two substrates, apart
from substrate positioning, is the fact that unlike in paraoxon hydrolysis, in this case the hydrogen
bond between the bridging hydroxide ion and the D151 is maintained throughout our simulations


and up to the transition state, but it is broken upon approaching the product complex, presumably
again to facilitate deprotonation of the product by D151 through a chain of water molecules
(see figure 4 for a representative Michaelis complex, transition state and product complex in the
presence of Zn?*). However, while there are geometric changes between the two substrates, once
again, and as can be seen from table 1, the differences between the metal ions are limited to the
subtle changes one would expect from the differences in the ionic radii of these ions.
