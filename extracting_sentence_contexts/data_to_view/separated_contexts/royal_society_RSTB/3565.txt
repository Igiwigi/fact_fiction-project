NEWELL ARBER ON THE FOSSIL FLORA OF

important deduction, which it was one of the particular objects of this work to
determine, that the whole of the productive coal measures of the Forest of Dean
belong to one horizon, the Upper Coal Measures. This conclusion is in entire
agreement with the opinion expressed by Dr. Krpston* many years ago, though the
fact that no other horizon is represented among the productive series had not
hitherto been proved, nor had the vertical distribution of the flora been previously
worked out in detail. We will now compare the fossil flora of the Forest of Dean with the Upper
Coal Measure floras as developed elsewhere in Britain. TasiE II.â€”The Distribution of the Forest of Dean Species i in other Coalfields.
