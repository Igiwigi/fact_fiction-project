To mark the 2009 International Year of Astronomy, my colleagues and I
recently visited both historic sites. With funding from the IAU and Royal
Astronomical Society, a new commemorative plaque (figure la) was placed at
the site in Principe (Ellis et al. 2009). An eclipse museum has been in place for
10 years at Sobral (figure 1b).

Given that general relativity had already demonstrated some measure of
success in predicting the perihelion precession of the planet Mercury (Einstein
1916), it is interesting to ask why it is that the solar deflection is regarded as
the key observation that catapulted Einstein to international fame. One possible
reason is simply the fact that the concept of gravitational lensing—a term possibly
introduced by Eddington himself—captured the imagination of the public as an

of the popular appeal of the experiment, a (now lost) cartoon referred to by some
early reviewers apparently depicts Sherlock Holmes spying a criminal behind a
wall, the light bent around the corner; the caption claims ‘Gravitational, my dear
Watson!’
