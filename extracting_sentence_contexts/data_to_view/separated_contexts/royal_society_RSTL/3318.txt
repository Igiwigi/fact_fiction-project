I exposed the spinal marrow, separated the distinct roots, and found
that the anterior root on being irritated excited motion, while the posterior root
did not excite the muscles. By inference, and by comparing the spinal nerves with
those of the encephalon, I was at length led to conclude that the anterior root is
provided for motion, and the posterior for sensation; and that the spinal nerves,
instead of being common nerves, are in truth combined of roots, one of which gives
motion and the other sensation. Many instances have presented themselves in the prosecution of this subject, to
show that, until directed by a knowledge of function, we are inattentive to facts of
daily occurrence. To take an example, since I had reason to conclude that the
columns of the spinal marrow, and the roots arising from them, were distinct in func-

tion, I have met with no instance of disease in the bodies of the yertebre attended
with paraplegia, in which the muscular power of the limbs has not been the first
affected: in all, the defect of motion has been greater than the diminution of sensi-
bility ; in some, the motion of the limbs has been lost, whilst the sensibility has been
exquisitely acute. These facts, it is now obvious, are to be accounted for by the motor roots of the
spinal nerves being more directly exposed to the influence of the inflammation seated
in the bodies of the vertebre, than the posterior roots of sensation, which arise more
remote from the disease.
