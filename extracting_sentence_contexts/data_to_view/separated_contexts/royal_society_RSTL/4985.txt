Dr. Lamont confines himself entirely to the diurnal inequality
of the Declination, leaving untouched the subject of the disturbances (or, as they are
more usually termed in Germany, the magnetic storms). Whether the progressive increase 80 distinctly marked in the two classes of phe-
nomena between the years 1843 and 1848 be or be not the result of causes which
bave a periodical action, in a cycle which may be either of regular or of variable
duration, the fact of the progressive increase being concurrent in both classes is of
no slight importance. It tends to indicate a causal connection su√æsisting between
the disturbances and the diurnal variation ; which latter, in addition to the laws
which point directly or indirectly to the sun as the origin of its every-day phenomena,
has other phases which mark unmistakeably, and at stations very variously situated
in geographical and magnetical respects, the equinoxes as epochs of periodical change. The investigation, of which the results are contained in this paper, has 5hown that the
disturbances have also a law of diurnal action, depending like that of the regular

diurnal variation on the hours of local time, but with different hours of maxima and
minima; it has also shown, generally, that there is an influence connected with the
period of the year on the frequency of occurrence of the disturbances of principal
magnitude, affecting the aggregate effects of the disturbing canses ; but it has not
yet succeeded in tracing a definite epoch of semiannual change in the disturbances
with the same precision as in the diurnal variation, of which the phenomena have
been s0 much longer and 80 much more minutely studied, and in which the epoch of
change in the phase depending on the earth's revolution in its orbit has been distinetly
traced to the very days of the equinoxes*.
