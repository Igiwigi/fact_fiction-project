The proposed approach, on the one hand, seems
to open perspectives to apply to AFM nanoparticles all the power of methods elaborated for
uniformly magnetized ferromagnets. But, on the other hand, it does not make it possible to
consider the case of complete magnetic compensation. The fact is that it leads to a doubtful
conclusion that the magnetic relaxation time of an antiferromagnet turns to zero in the absence
of spontaneous magnetization. Thus, the role of the latter in the response of AFM nanoparticles
to an external field could hardly be clarified by this methodology. Meanwhile, such a study is in
demand, inter alia, due to prospects of usage of AFM nanoparticles in spintronic devices [14-16]
and nanomedicine [17-19]

The theory presented in this paper in a natural way includes the case of the totally
compensated sublattices.
