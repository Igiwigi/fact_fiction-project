The action of a kth root of unity
@ picks out eigenspaces in the cohomology with eigenvalue w’ for 0 < ¢< k. The
S-duality property implies that on the sum of these cohomology spaces for all k
there is an action of SL(2,Z) compatible with linear transformations of the vector
(k,£). This linkage between parts of the cohomology of different spaces is quite
alien to the traditional topologist, but can in fact be shown mathematically. The group SZ(2,Z) and modular forms appear frequently also in what are
called ‘wall-crossing’ formulae for Donaldson invariants—jumps in the invari-
ants when passing from one generic regime to another. Wall-crossing in other
moduli problems has generated a new area in geometry where the naive descrip-
tion of a partition function as a generating function for counting objects has to
be replaced by more sophisticated ways of counting and encapsulating the data.
