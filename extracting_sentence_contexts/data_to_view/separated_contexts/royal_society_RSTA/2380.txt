In Figure 7 Ty =Te+ T+ Ty >Th
and the period is longer than 2(7z + Jj), while in figure 8 Ty =Te+ 7 -â€” Ty < Tj, and the period is
shorter than 2(7z + Jj). The period of the oscillation increases as the total delay is increased within
the range where the stable oscillation exists. Although from table 2, it would appear the period
depends linearly on the total delay, in fact, the times TE, Th, Ty, Ty can depend on the delay, so
other than case (1,1) the dependence is nonlinear. In all simulations, the two E-cells (red and green curves) quickly synchronize on the periodic
orbit. Further, as predicted by corollary 3.5 identical periodic orbits with different phase difference
between the E- and J-cells occur for different values of 7 and Tg with the same total delay.
