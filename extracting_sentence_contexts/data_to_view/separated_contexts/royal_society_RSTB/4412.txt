The middle lamella offers less resistance to the
shearing stresses than the other layers of the thick wall. This mechanical weakness
of the middle lamella is not manifested in the tension and compression failures since
the stress is mainly taken by the other layers of the wall in these cases. It would be possible to use, to some extent, the facts described above in support
of the micellar hypothesis of NAcrtt. It has been shown that, in regard to their
mechanical properties, the cell-walls of wood manifest an anisotropy closely parallel
to that shown in regard to such other physical properties as double refraction and
swelling. In terms of the micellar hypothesis, the axes of greatest optical elasticity,

* Andaman Padouk and Swamp Cypress also conform to this type.
