just over the edge of the terminal face of the core, where it‚Äù has no motion at all
(bere, by another arrangement of the experiment, it is known to tend in what is at
present an upward direction from the core). If carried a little further outwards, the
magnetism then makes the bismuth ball tend to go outwards or be repelled, and
sneh continues to be the direction of the force in any further position, or down the
side of the end of the core.

2299. In fact, the circular edge formed by the intersection of the end of the core
with its sides, is virtually the apex of the magnetic pole, to a body placed like the
bismuth ball close to it, and it is because the lines of magnetic force issning from it
diverge as it were, and weaken rapidly in all directions from it, that the ball also
tends to pass in all directions either inwards or upwards, or outwards from it, and
thus produces the motions described. These same effects do not in fact all occur
when the ball, being taken to a greater distance from the iron, is placed in magnetic
curves, having generally a simpler direction. In order to remove the effect of the
edge, an iron cone was placed on the top of the core, converting the flat end into a
cone, and then the indicating ball was urged to move upwards, only when over the
apex of the cone, and upward and outwards, as it was more or less on one side of it,
being always repelled from the pole in that direction, which transferred it most
rapidly from strong to weaker points of magnetic force.

2300. To return to the vertical flat pole: when a horizontal bar of bismuth was
suspended concentrically and close to the pole, it could take up a position in any
direction relative to the axis of the pole, having at the same time a tendency to move
upwards or be repelled from it. If its point of snspension was a little excentric, the
