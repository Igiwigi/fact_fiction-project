By contrast, when statistics are computed over
a collection of personal data, the analyst (understood broadly as any party with access to the
published outcome) is both the proper consumer of the statistics and a potential privacy attacker. Semantic security has proved to be a fundamental concept for encryption. In fact, encryption
schemes that are in common use today are semantically secure (under some mathematical
assumptions). However, Dwork & Naor [29] demonstrated that the concept cannot be applied
in the context of private data analysis as it would imply (reusing Dalenius’ words in [28])
‘elimination of statistics’. To understand what this means, consider an example, taken from
Dwork & Naor [29].
