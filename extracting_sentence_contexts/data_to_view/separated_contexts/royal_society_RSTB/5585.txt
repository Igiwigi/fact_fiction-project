After standing for two hours only 0-47 c.c. of
N/10 iodine had been absorbed. It can therefore be concluded that the substance does
not react with alkaline iodine and hence contains no free CHO groups. This conclusion
is supported by the fact that the substance did not reduce Beneptct’s solution, nor
did it form an osazone with phenylhydrazine. Section 3.—Acid hydrolysis of luteic acid and examination of hydrolytic products.

10 gm. of luteic acid were hydrolysed with 500 c.c. of N/1 sulphuric acid on a boiling
water-bath for about nine hours. The sulphuric acid was removed quantitatively with
pure barium hydroxide.
