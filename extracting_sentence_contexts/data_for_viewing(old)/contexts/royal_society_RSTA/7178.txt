This difference is probably due to the superior pick-up of Service azide compared with
dextrinated azide.
° The threshold temperatures for dextrinated azide lie below those for Service azide throughout
= the region of temperatures investigated, but the curves may cross outside this region. As has
$® been previously pointed out (part II (1)), the temperatures corresponding with pick-up
‘S sensitiveness lie above the inversion point of about 400° C, above which induction periods
‘6 for Service azide are shorter than for, dextrinated azide. Allowance for this crossing over
5 must be made before attempting to correlate pick-up with sensitiveness to heat.
2 The fact that compression increases sensitiveness to percussion and heat is in contrast with
9 anumber of high explosives which are less sensitive at higher densities, and appears to be
$. associated with the special pick-up mechanism of initiators.
& _ Itis ofinterest to note that the Frank-Kamenetsky relation between threshold temperature
a and mass, may be written in the form

& = kp err RTS o, )
5 m 2a (ahr? E .0°88),

‘3 where a = area of cross-section of the tube, p = density of pellet, and 1, = heat/unit mass.
© _ Since the value of & is almost certainly increased by increasing the density, an increase
5 in density should normally raise m for the same 7), if the self-heating mechanism operates.
