Neveu-Kato Convergence Theorem is available, see [9] Section 8.4.16, [4] Ch. 13, or [10]
Section 3.1.4). Instead, he argues that since the resolvents increase with r, so do the semigroups,
and establishes convergence of the latter somewhat independently. Consequently, he needs to
worry about additional issues which today are easily resolved with the help of the Trotter-Neveu—
Kato Theorem. He might have been aware of the perils awaiting those who want to deduce
convergence of semigroups from convergence of resolvents. Is this the reason why he so quickly
spotted the gap in Trotter’s reasoning?

To complete the story of [8]: Kato successfully completes his reasoning by proving that the
generator A of the limiting semigroup is a restriction of Q (and an extension of D + O), and that
in fact the semigroup generated by A is in a sense minimal. Notably, even if the implication:
convergence of resolvents > convergence of the semigroups is not used here directly, we are in
fact facing one of the predecessors of the Trotter-Neveu—Kato Theorem.

3. Kisynski'’s proof; Sova and Kurtz’s approach

For the presentation of the results in this section, it will be convenient, instead of considering
families of semigroups of operators, to consider their sequences: we start with the semigroups
{Ty (t),t = 0}, = 1 in a Banach space X, such that, as in (2.1), ||Tn(#)|| < Me”; the generator of the
nth semigroup is Ay. Clearly, both Trotter-Neveu-Kato Theorems are still valid in this case, with
minor, obvious changes, such as replacing lim,_,1— by limy 0.

Trotter’s proof of the convergence theorem is long and involved; in 1967 a truly beautiful
argument by Jan Kisyrski was published [11]. The idea is to work in the space c(X) of convergent
sequences with values in X, and to deduce the convergence theorem from the Hille-Yosida
