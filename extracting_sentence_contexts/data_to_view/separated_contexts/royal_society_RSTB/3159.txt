That
such a condition as occurs in the elephant could be derived from the condition in the
sheep is quite comprehensible. It is clear that, from the shape of the cells in the trophoblast in the sheep where it
is bathed by blood of maternal origin in the region under discussion (figs. 27 and
28, Plate 11), and also from the fact that many nuclei in this region show mitotic
figures, this must be a region through which the foetus is gaining considerable
nourishment. Considering the very long period of gestation in the elephant, there is no great
difficulty in conceiving how this part of the placenta of that animal may have arisen
from the extravasation of blood between the mother and foetus. The chief difficulty
is in conceiving how the circulation, which we must suppose to exist, is initiated.
