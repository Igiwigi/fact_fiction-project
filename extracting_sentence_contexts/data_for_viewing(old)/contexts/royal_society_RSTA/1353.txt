Let us further consider an overall quad-mesh tessellation indicated topologically by the
checkerboard in figure 3b. To populate the sector angles on this quad-mesh, we first isolate the
lower left quad (in red) and, in the local notation of 3(a), we set ag =a, By = B, a, = &, By = Band
atc, Bc, &g, Bg in (iii). This yields the description of the sector angles shown. This panel in isolation
can be folded along six distinct mountain-valley assignments. We then move on to the adjacent
panel (either above or to the right) and attempt to prescribe it so as to fold degenerately as in the
family in (iii). There is exactly one way to do this: The sector angles diagonal to each other are
directly related by the rules in (iii). Since we know the sector angles around two of four vertices,
we use this relationship to determine the other two vertices. We then iterate using this basic fact.
This iteration leads to the sector angles displayed in the 4 x 4 checkerboard in the figure. Note
the left boundary and right boundary have the same sector angles. Similarly, the bottom and top
boundary also have the same sector angles. In other words, iteration produces a 4 x 4 mesh that
is periodic in the sector angles.

Can a mesh with these sector angles be tessellated? The crux of the matter is the side lengths.
Using the notation of figure 3b, one needs ¢; = é; and w; = %;. These quantities, however, cannot
be prescribed arbitrarily. Recalling again the notation in figure 3a, the side lengths are related to

3Here and in the remainder of this section, we drop the ‘1’ when referencing mountain-valley assignments, i.e. the quantities
belonging to the set (3.2).
