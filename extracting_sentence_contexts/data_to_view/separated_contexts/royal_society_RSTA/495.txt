Gi +q2—H( #?) Go| (115) Le=Gt+lh |
and Ly = — (G1 +91) —H(Go+ 92)

where primes denote differentiation with respect to v. It can be readily verified that the
foregoing expressions for L,, L;, L, and Ly satisfy Batchelor’s differential equations (113). Indeed, the appearance of two arbitrary functions of in the solution (115) is in agreement
with the fact that two differential equations govern four functions. 8. THE DYNAMICAL EQUATIONS

From the equations of motion we derive in the usual fashion that the equation governing
the rate of change of Q;; is (cf.
