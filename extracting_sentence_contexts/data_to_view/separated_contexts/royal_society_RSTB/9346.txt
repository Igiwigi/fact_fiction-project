Before sceptical readers fall about laughing, let
me stress that this is a claim about the system as a whole and

its institutional design, not about the motivations of pro-
fessional participants in particular cases. Indeed, the very
self-serving partisanship which adversarial lawyers are
expected to display in developing their litigation strategies is
the motor that drives adversarial truth-seeking. The parties
have both the presumptive knowledge and the strongest
motivation to present their own best cases to the fact-finder,
and to interrogate their adversarial opponentâ€™s arguments
and supporting evidence through vigorous cross-examination. Adversarialism is an incomparably efficient way of narrowing
down the issues and getting to the heart of factual disputes
[51,55]. Criminal procedure regulates not only the generation
and presentation of evidence, but also its testing and evalu-
ation.
