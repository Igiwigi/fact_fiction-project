(a) Noise removal and step detection: the inadequacy of linear filtering

One of the ‘canonical’ problems in signal processing is filtering: the removal of some component
of the signal while leaving the other components unchanged. Configuration changes in molecular
and cellular systems are obscured by thermal and other sources of noise. The classical, linear


signal processing solution to this problem is simoothing or filtering: by obtaining (weighted)
averages over a temporal window around each sample in the signal, a statistical estimate of the
configuration at each point in time can be obtained. However, severe limitations to this strategy
arise when the signal can change abruptly, rather than smoothly: in fact, this is not a problem for
which classical linear DSP is suited.

To illustrate why classical linear filtering is problematic in this situation, consider the
archetypal, step-like signal: the square wave—periodic with instantaneous transitions between two
different amplitudes—which is obscured by serially uncorrelated (white) noise. A fundamental
fact about linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems is the existence of a unique spectral description,
so it is instructive to describe the situation in the Fourier domain. The only Fourier coefficients
of the square wave that are non-zero are odd, integer multiples of the frequency of the wave,
and are proportional to 1/n, where n is the index of the Fourier component. Thus, the Fourier :
series has an infinite number of non-zero terms (infinite bandwidth), and truncating the series 7
introduces spurious oscillations (Gibbs phenomena) near the edges of the square wave, with the is
amplitude of these oscillations increasing as the truncation becomes more drastic. At the same a
