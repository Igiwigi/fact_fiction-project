whereas some forms, such as Ustilago destruens,* first develope a definite mycelium
from the resting-spore, and the yeast-like cells are budded off from this into the air,
in other cases the budding commences at once on the germination of the spore. Thus,
in Ustilago antherarum,t the budding begins direct from the spore, or immediately the
promycelium is protruded. Similarly with Ustilago intermedia,{ U. Maydis, and others.
Now, if we supposed the spore to germinate in this manner while still attached to the
mycelium inside the plant, we should have something very like what happens in the
Fungus I have described. In fact, I regard the swollen parts of the mycelium which
give rise to the gemmules as the homologues of the spores proper (i.e., resting-spores)
in the ordinary Ustilagines. Anyone who compares the development of the spores
in those Ustilaginese which have been sufficiently studied§ cannot fail to notice the
remarkable similarity to the development of the branches which bud off the gemmules
in this Fungus. If, for any reason, the future resting-spore of an Ustilago began to
put forth buds (gemmules) before it developed its thick coats, we should have the
very process I have been describing. In the case of the Fungus causing the tubercles
on the roots of Leguminosze it is not difficult to suggest that it might obviously be a
disadvantage to the parasite to develope resting-spores, of (comparatively) large size,
which should be set free on the rotting of the root, since they would not easily be
disseminated in the soil; on the other hand, it would seem to be a great step gained
if the habit of forming yeast-like gemmules no larger than Bacteria was thrown back,
