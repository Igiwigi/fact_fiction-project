In summary, the theory under consideration is concerned with approximate solution of
nonlinear integro-differential model that describes the transient phase transition dynamics
complicated by crystal nucleation and growth processes. Taking into account the previously
developed theory of particle nucleation in a motionless metastable liquid [7,16], we analytically
describe the mushy layer evolution in unsteady-state manner which is caused by the crystal
nucleation phenomenon. Let us especially underline here that the phase transition boundary
evolves as a/f + &Z,(t), where Z,(t)=tâ€™/* and Z,(t)= ft? for the kinetic and diffusionally
controlled scenarios of particle evolution. In addition, the growth rate parameters a > 0 and 6 <0
are determined analytically too.

The present analytical approach can be easily extended to more complex phase transition
regimes in the presence of moving phase transition regions (e.g. ternary and multicomponent
systems [40]). For instance, it can be applied to ternary melts with allowance for the fact that the
temperature relaxation time is much smaller than the corresponding relaxation times of solute
impurities. The theory under consideration can also be used to describe the non-equilibrium
