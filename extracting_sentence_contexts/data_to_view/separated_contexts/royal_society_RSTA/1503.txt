Since,
however, all these later determinations vary by only a few thousandths of an Angstrom
unit from one another, or from Burns’ original series of 2,300 tertiary standards, the
latter have been retained without alteration in Table VI, since the calculations based
on them would not be altered appreciably by varying the third decimal in the wave-
lengths. 7. Rotatory Power of Quartz in the Violet and Ultra-Violet Regions.

(a) Ultra-Violet Rotations of Short and Long Columns of Quartz.—Attention has already
been directed to the fact that, when light which has passed through a substantial column
of quartz in a polarimeter is examined spectroscopically, several extinctions are seen
simultaneously, which pass along the spectrum when the analyser is rotated, pursuing
one another across the field of view like a series of ripples. With the very long columns
used in the present experiments this effect begins to disappear, since the ripples are almost
as abundant as the lines. The effect is, therefore, more like that of a series of narrow
shadows falling on a widely-spaced railing, the rails of which would flicker with the light
and shade, but without reproducing the regular wave-length of the shadows.
