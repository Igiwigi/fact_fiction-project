We may therefore consider it as clearly established that the uniaxal double
refraction of the resinous mass has been communicated to the individual
molecules by simple pressure ; the increased transparency arising from the
molecules being brought into closer contact, and the regular double refraction
from the variable density impressed upon each elastic molecule, and symmetri-
cally related to the axis of pressure. The effect thus produced on the resinous
mass is precisely the same as what would take place by subjecting elastic
spheres to a regular compressing force. 'The axis of pressure becomes an axis
of positive double refraction, and the double refraction increases with the in-
clination of the ray to the axis, and becomes a maximum in the equator of
the molecules.

By this view of the preceding facts, we are led to a very simple explanation
of the origin and general phenomena of double refraction in regular crystals.
That this property is not inherent in the molecules themselves may be easily
proved. The particles of silex, for example, do not possess it in their separate
state, In tabasheer, in many opals, and in melted quartz, there is not the
slightest trace of the doubly refracting structure : but when the particles of
silex in s0lution are allowed to combine, in virtue of their polarities or mutual
affinities, they then instantly acquire, at the moment of their combination, the
property of double refraction, and they retain it while they continue in this
state of aggregation. The manner in which this takes place may be easily
conceived: a nunber of elastic molecules existing in a state of solution, or in
a state. of fusion, are kept at snch a distance by the fluid in the one case, and
by the heat in the other, as to preclude the operation of their mutual affinities ;
