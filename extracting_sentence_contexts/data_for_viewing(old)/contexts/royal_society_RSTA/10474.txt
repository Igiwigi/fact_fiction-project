polished surface of the specimen by the production of a burr, or rough and jagged
irregular edge, broadening the slip-band, and suggesting the accumulation of débris.
Within the crystal this repeated grinding tends to destroy the cohesion of the metal
across the surface of slip, and in certain cases this develops into a crack. Once the
crack is formed it quickly grows in a well-known manner, by tearing at its edge, in
consequence of the concentration of stress which results from lack of continuity.
Engineers are familiar with the development of cracks, even in the most ductile
materials, when these are initiated at air-bubbles or other flaws. The present
experiments show how a crack may be formed, without any flaw to serve as nucleus,
the first breach of continuity being set up through repeated grinding on a plane of
slip in perfectly sound metal.

The experiments throw light on the known fact that fracture by repeated reversals
or alternations of stress resembles fracture resulting from a “creeping” flaw in its
abruptness and in the absence of local drawing-out or other deformation of shape.

They also help to explain why it is that a piece that has been subjected to many
reversals shows no apparent loss of strength or plasticity when subjected to an
ordinary tensile test. So long as the reversals have not yet reached the stage ot
producing cracks, it is not to be expected that such a test will detect the
deterioration which has occurred. The material will still yield by slipping much as
at first, and neither its plasticity nor its strength need show much change.
