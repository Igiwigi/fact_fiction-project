They are general phenomena
which can only be avoided by special choice of the conditions of propagation. The
unusual form of the phase-rays merely expresses the effect of the earthâ€™s magnetic field in
producing asymmetry between the propagation of the upgoing and downcoming waves. The explanation of this result depends on the fact that what we have been discussing
so far is only the phase-propagation, whereas it is the group-propagation which yields
cuspless rays of more conventional type than those shown in fig. 8. b
