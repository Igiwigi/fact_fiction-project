116 Mr. Howarp on the late extraordinary depression, &c.

for © April, 1782, 6.125 in. ; and for © May, 5-722 in.” at
Lyndon ; yet the South Lambeth table, given along with his
own, exhibits but 6.24 in. for these two months; and states
6.88 in. for the seventh month ( July), following, where he
has but 2.70 in, I am almost at a loss for an apology to the
Society, for having in my last paper anticipated, on the
strength of a single .analogy, a dry year for 1821, the fact
being, that there has fallen at Tottenham, in the whole year,
no less than $3.84 inches. It seems as if, with all our
anxiety to pass the stream of uncertainty in this science, we
must give over making the wooden bridges of conjecture,
and wait till we can accumulate more solid materials.
