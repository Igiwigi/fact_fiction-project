These cases probably illustrate the non-fulfilment of the con-

SHition that the foremost ion must be by nature the faster. Ee Theory of the Moving Boundary. “a Itis easy to deduce the behaviour of the ions on each side of a moving boundary
from the fundamental equation given at the beginning of this paper, and from the fact
Sthat the visible (coloured) ion keeps pace with the invisible (colourless) ion in front of it. Ee Let the boundary in question be that between visible and invisible cations travel-
