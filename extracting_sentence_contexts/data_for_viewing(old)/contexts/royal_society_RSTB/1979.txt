as yet no positive evidence to derive from any of the other groups, may be considered
to some extent by themselves. This consideration appears to me to lessen the force
of the objection, which has been raised to the use of the phenomena of apogamy and
apospory for phylogenetic purposes, that they are as yet unknown in such groups as
the Lycopodinez:.§

The Ferns appear in some respects the best suited of the Vascular Cryptogams for
the attempt to obtain experimental evidence on the nature of alternation of genera-
tions. If the gametophyte and the sporophyte are to be traced back to originally
similar stages of a primitive organism, it is evident that the sexual plant has diverged
less widely from the latter than the sporophyte has. Among the Vascular Cryptogams

* “The mosses are to be regarded as a farther, and, in fact, as it appears, geologically late develop-
ment from the Thallophytes.” ‘Monatsber. d. k. Akad. Wiss., Berlin.’ 1875, p. 245, note. The
philosophical considerations on the nature of alternation in plants, and the clear recognition of the
important bearing on morphological questions of the polyphyletic origin of the higher forms, are in
many points still unrecognised in current views on homology.

+ “One will have to look for the point of attachment of the Pteridophytes elsewhere than among the
Mascinew, in forms which may have been similar to Liverworts, but whose asexual generation has from
the first proceeded on another line of development.” Scnmnk’s ‘ Handbuch,’ vol. 2, p. 401.

$ This is the logical outcome of the view that the Archegoniates have hada monophyletic origin. Tt
is indicated in many diagrams of the affinities of the various groups.
