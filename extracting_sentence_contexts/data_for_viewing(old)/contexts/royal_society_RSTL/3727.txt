the air; for we know that the formation of the slightest visible vapour instantly di-
minishes the solar intensity, We can hardly doubt that this action must depend
upon the relative dampness of the atmosphere, that is, upon the portion of moisture
existing, compared to what could exist without deposition in an equal space, and not
upon the absolute elasticity of the vapour: for it is plain that vapour of given elas-
ticity would make a dense visible cloud at one temperature, and might yet be com-
patible with intense relative dryness at another. I have therefore taken particular
pains in the reduction of the hygrometric observations, and the course of the pro-
gress of dampness at Brientz and the Faulhorn in curves V. and VL. is particularly
worthy of observation. At the former, the /ower station, the dampness is greatest in
the morning and evening, and has a minimum between 1 and 2 p.m. At the wpper
Station, on the contrary, the dampness increases almost continually from morning till
night. These facts are perfectly normal*, and are readily explained by the continual
rise of the imperfectly condensed moisture which occupies the valleys of the Alps
every fine night in summer, and is gradually exhaled into the upper atmosphere by
the action of currents and the increasing warmth of the inferior strata,â€”a phenome-
non from which arises (amongst other effects) the very frequent formation, about
noon in the finest weather, of clouds at a height of from 8 to 15000 feet, which again
give way during the advance of evening as the vapour descends.

73. The curve of mean dampness at both stations (VII.) exhibits a morning and
afternoon maximum about 9 a.m. and 3 P.y., preceding somewhat the epochs of
maximum loss of solar radiation already referred to. This is an important analogy.
and an inspection of Curye VII. together with Curye XIV., which represents the loss
of solar radiation in terms of the radiation at the upper station, will show a certain
