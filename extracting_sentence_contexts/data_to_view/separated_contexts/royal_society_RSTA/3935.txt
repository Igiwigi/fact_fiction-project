Decomposing {i into ideal and excess parts, ji = kgT In[n.A°] + jx (with A the de Broglie thermal
wavelength) and using equation (2.13),

ksT
O=du=dfii+dF ; dn + dji® + dF. (3.7)

Thus by imposing d¥ = —dji™, one gets di = 0 across the system, as desired. A similar argument
involving the excess chemical potential to achieve the constant density route was derived in
reference [20]. In fact, the self-consistent iterative evaluation of F(A) to achieve constant density
presented in [20] looks at the relation dF = —dji® the other way around, ie. as a fast and efficient
way to evaluate the excess chemical potential ji of complex molecules (e.g. polymers), on which
the Widom insertion method fails.

(c) Kirkwood free energy integration: canonical A subsystems

In terms of our description, the Kirkwood thermodynamic integration (TI) corresponds to a series
of A subsystems which are thermally connected but which are not allowed to exchange mass. Thus,
each 4 box has the same N, T and V and density 1 = N/V. Equivalently, it can be seen as a unique
system with fixed mass and volume (and temperature) whose transformation parameter is varied
from 4 =0 to 4=1.
