The Spiral Form as general in Animals as in Plants— Universality—and Early
Appearance of the Spiral Form.

17. It is known that vegetable tissue presents, in some parts, a feature which has
heretofore scemed wanting, or nearly $0, in that of animals—the spiral form. I
venture to believe that some appearances met with in my investigations may go far
towards supplying this deficiency. These appearances will be found represented in
the nervous tissue (Plates VI., VIII., IX.), in muscle (Plates VI., VII., VIIL., IX.), in
minute blood-vessels (fig. 16), and in the crystalline lens (fig. 131). If indeed the
view above mentioned—that the larger and the smaller filaments have the same
structure—be correct, it follows that spirals are much more general in plants them-
selves than has been hitherto snapposed. Spirals would thus appear, in fact, to be
as universal as a © fibrous” structure.

18. The tendency to the spiral form manifests itself yery early. Of this the most
important instance is afforded by the corpuscle of the blood, as above described. I
have also obtained an interesting proof of it in cartilage from the ear of a rabbit
(figs. 133 to 136), where the nucleus, lying loose in its cell, resembled a ball of
twine; being actually composed, at its outer part, like the nuclei of certain blood-
corpuscles, of a coiled filament ; which it was giving off to weave the cell-wall ;
this cell-wall being no other than the last formed portion of what is termed the inter-
cellular substance—the essential part of cartilage.

19. I think there is ground for believing, that the nucleus of the cell in cartilage,
