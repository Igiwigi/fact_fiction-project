Next, owing to the action of the combined direct load mW and torque
G the tube stretches to length / + 37 and twists through an angle y. This strain may be
represented by the components

The shear s = 7,7/l and since the material does not change in density during the
extension from [y to 1, 7,, = t9 (1 + é)~!, where 7,» is the mean radius of the tube

Cre = @, Cy = — te —f, €,,=—te+f }
before the first stretching. Hence

by = 8, 6 .=0, €, =0
The extension
8 = Tino Io? (1 + e)~*x.

e = 31/l = 81/lp (1 + &).

As has already been pointed out if the density and internal volume of the tube do not
change ¢,, = e., = — de so that the strain f in (4) is proportional to the change in
internal volume, in fact

change in internal volume 2 change in radius et change in length

To find the direction of its principal axes put

The strain quadrie then becomes

The strain quadric is now referred to its principal axes if the coefficient of 2’ y’ is zero,
1.e., if

The stress quadric is

and substituting
a=2 cos 0—y'sn0, y=a2'sind +y' cos 0
this becomes

Tf 6 is now chosen so that 2’y’ are principal axes of stress, the coefficient of a’y’ in (14)
