values of the numerical constants. If the first as well as the second change gave
rise to a radiation, the equation would be of the same general form, but the value of
the numerical constants would be different, the values depending upon the ratio of
the ionization in the first and second changes. If, for example, it is supposed that
both changes give out 8 rays in equal amounts, it can readily be calculated that the
equation of decay would be

L = “BN —Ast +k Xs _ ) omAat

Taking the values of \, and A, found by Curte, the numerical factor e~** becomes
2°15 instead of 4°3 and 1°15 instead of 3:3. The theoretical curve of decay in this
ease would be readily distinguishable from the observed curve of decay. The fact
that the equation of decay found by Curte and Dannz involves the necessity of an
initial rayless change can be simply shown as follows :—

Curve I. (fig. 11) shows the experimental curve. At the moment of removal ot
the body from the emanation (disregarding the initial rapid change), the matter must
consist of both Band C. Consider the matter which existed in the form C at the
moment of removal. It will be transformed according to an exponential law, the
activity falling to half in 28 minutes. This is shown in curve II, Curve III.
represents the difference between the ordinates of curves I. and II. It will be
seen that it is identical in shape with the curve (fig. 5) showing the variation of the
activity for a short exposure, measured by the B rays. It passes through a maximum
at the same time (about 36 minutes). The explanation of such a curve is only
