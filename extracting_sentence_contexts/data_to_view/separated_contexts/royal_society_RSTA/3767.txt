This we found subsequently due to the
Braet that the gas was pumped out of the fractionating bulb without removing the
jacket of liquid air; and under these circumstances, the xenon, of which the density
Sis 64, remained in the bulb. On one occasion, the jacket was removed; and the
Bamall remaining quantity was collected separately ; it turned out to possess a ABO:
iru totally differing from that of krypton, and was subsequently named ‘“ xenon.’ The spectrum of krypton is one which is remarkable for its brilliancy, and for the
fact that a small amount of gas, present along with argon, is easily recognised by the
Sspectroscope ; and this led us to believe that krypton possessed a density not
-adiffering greatly from that of argon. Repeated fractionation, moreover, did not
Zappear to produce any marked change in its character or brilliancy. = It would be tedious to relate in detail all the unsuccessful experiments which were
ae before the truth was discovered, that krypton isa gas present in very small
E quantity, but possessing a density of 40°8.
