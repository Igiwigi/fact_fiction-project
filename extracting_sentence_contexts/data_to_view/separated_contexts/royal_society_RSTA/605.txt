The
need for low uncertainty measurements of spectral responsivities can be especially challenging
with near-infrared detectors which are not as well characterized as their visible counterparts, and
low uncertainty measurements in the out-of-band region could be difficult using detectors with
radiometric scales which can have substantially larger uncertainties than in the visible.

3. Design of a near-infrared primary radiometric thermometer

(a) Optical and chassis design

The physical design of a near-infrared radiation thermometer is not different from that of a
radiation thermometer which operates in the visible wavelength region. This is due to the fact that


Table 1. The optical performances quantified by the Strehl ratio as a function of wavelength for a commercial 200 mm focal-
length achromatic objective lens. Higher Strehl ratios indicate better imaging performance, and the same lens exhibits better
imaging performance at 1550 nm than at 500 nm.
