The
feedback is controversial because it is assumed that cold climate results in a
reduction in ice volume: sea ice growth causes a reduction in precipitation in ice-
covered areas and, by this mechanism, almost suppresses accumulation of snow on
ice sheets. The latter then no longer compensates for ice ablation and ice volume
shrinks. A free oscillation arises from the fact that the ice volume thresholds for
switching sea ice cover ‘on’ and ‘off’ differ. In other words, sea ice displays a
hysteresis response to variations in ice volume. This is exactly the principle of
the slow-fast relaxation oscillator depicted in figure 2a: the curve of equilibrium of
sea ice with respect to ice volume is the slow manifold, and ice volume integrates
the state of sea ice in time.
