of (x,y) in terms of 6 give (x,y, 1) proportional to rational and integral functions of the
parameter of the degree 6; 80 that not only the curve is a sextic curve, but it is a uni-
cursal sextic, or curve of the order 6 with the maximum number, =10, of nodes and
cusps; that is, if $ be the number of nodes and # the number of cusps, we have 3+x=10.
Moreover, introducing the same parameter into the equation of the tangent, this equation
is 8een to be of the degree 4 in the parameter ; that is, the class of the curve is =4: this
implies 23+3z=26, and we have therefore 3=4, z=6. To verify these numbers, it is

X to be remarked that it appears by the equation of the curye that there is at each of the

8 circular points at infinity a triple point in the nature of the point x=0, y=0 on the

5 curve y*=2*; such a point is in fact equivalent to two cusps and a node, and we have
thus the two circular points at infinity counting together as 2 nodes and 4 cusps ; there

= Should therefore besides be 2 nodes and 2 cusps, and I proceed to establish the existence

HD of these by means of the expressions for (@, y) in terms of 9.

S 10. To find the cusps, we have

Z W=—in 26(3 cos 6—2m)=0,

B: Y = ecos20(3co88—2m)=0,
