Thus, the drag increase
caused by spanwise slip was found to plateau. In contrast, the streamwise slip always reduces
the intensity of turbulent fluctuations, and thus frictional drag steadily decreased with increasing
Az. In fact, they predicted that drag reduction would always be observed when A; > 5, regardless
of the magnitude of at. Jelly et al. [53] reported similar findings with their DNS results (figure 5c). In their work, the authors showed that the Reynolds stresses differed over the regions of slip
and no slip.
