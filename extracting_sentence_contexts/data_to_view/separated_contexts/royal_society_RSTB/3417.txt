The anatomy of the peduncles and cones, and
the vascular supply of the scales and ovules, is so strikingly like that of the Cycads
that it is impossible to avoid the impression that there is here more than analogy. It seems not unreasonable to suppose that the sorus receptacle has here secondarily
taken up an axillary position, and that the bundles supplying its base have
therefore become inserted lower on the bract bundles than in the Cycads,

There are points of striking similarity between the ovules of Welwitschia and
Bennettites. In Bennettites the microsporangia are foliar, a fact which seems to
suggest that the megasporangia are also primitively foliar. The bracts of Welwitschia are thus compared with the carpels of the Angiosperms,
the interseminal scales of Bennettites, and the ovuliferous scales of the Cycads.

10. The ovule of Welwitschia appears to have some remarkably primitive
characters.
