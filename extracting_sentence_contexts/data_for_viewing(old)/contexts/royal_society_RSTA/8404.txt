with Ni 16 as basis was made at the N.P.L., followed in due course by a determination
at the B.I.P.M., Sévres. Unexpectedly the two results were not in agreement, the
divergence being nearly one part in a million. There appeared to be no evidence pro-
viding an explanation of the difference, and consequently further work had to be under-
taken with a view to finding if possible the root of this trouble, and obtaining new results
in better accord. ‘This involved much repetition of observations in order to establish
results, and further complications were introduced, first by Ni 16, which in the early
stages gave one discordant result out of a number of very concordant ones, and later
manifested curious and unexplained changes in length, and secondly by changes in the
basic values accepted for the B.I.P.M. standards.

A description of this work, showing how the divergence was eventually reduced to
small but not entirely negligible proportions is given below, the facts being recorded for
convenience in chronological order.
