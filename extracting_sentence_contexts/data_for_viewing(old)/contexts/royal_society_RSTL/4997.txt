604 DR. T. WILLIAMS ON THE BLOOD-PROPER AND

The presence of cilia on the internal snrface of these canals strikingly and fanda-
mentally distinguishes the latter from true blood-vessels, and intimately allies them,
homologically, with the spacious perigastric chambers of the Echinoderms and
Annelids.

The fluid contained in the gastro-vascular canals of the Medus is a compound of
salt water and chyle. In the Rhizostomidze it presents a yellowish hue, in Felella it
is bluish ; it is always corpusculated. The floating cells exhibit great irritability, but
they are not locomotive; the minute molecules are mutually repulsive. In this fluid
living polygastric animalcules are constantly met with. The fact of their constant pre-
sence proves the direct admission of the external sea-water into these canals, but they
are in time digested. The largest corpuscles are furnished with an involucram, fig. 3.
In Rhizostoma (a specimen of average size) they vary in measurement from 45;5dth to
zooodth of an inch. They are never organized to such a standard as to contain a
defined centric nucleus.

The formative power of the cell is expended in the production of secondary oleagi-
nous cellules and * molecular base,‚Äù which constitute the contained parts of all the
larger parent-corpuscles. Thesmallest cells are filled only with a limpid oleine, of slight
refractive power. Evaporated, in Rhizostoma this fluid yields abundant crystals of
chloride of sodium. In no Acaleph whatever are the gastro-vascular canals tunnelled
in the centre of the substance of the disc. They are always situated as superficially
