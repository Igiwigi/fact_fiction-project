The final decision to publish was reached unanimously by the Advisory Board, and we
are now confident that these papers merit publication on scientific grounds, which is our
only concern. Science is, of course, an on-going process. Future work may reveal facts that
support the conclusions reached here or go against them. The work on which these new
facts will be based may come from individuals or from institutions. Philosophical Transactions
will consider for publication all future material in this and other subject areas, regardless of
its provenance.
