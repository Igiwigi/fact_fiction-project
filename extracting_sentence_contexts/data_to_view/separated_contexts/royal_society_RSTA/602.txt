Most widely used is pulsed !*Â°Pt nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR), in which the spin temperature of the platinum nuclei just before the first pulse is
determined and taken as the thermodynamic temperature assuming that the Pt nuclear spins
were in thermal equilibrium with the conduction electrons. Over more than three decades, this has
proved to be a reliable method to determine ultra-low temperatures. However, one disadvantage
of this technique is the fact that considerable heat is deposited during the pulse sequence. In
recent years, efforts have been increased to establish a second technique based on thermal noise : =
for measuring ultra-low temperatures in primary mode or at least in relative primary mode. One 3
of these techniques is based on the measurement of thermal current noise originating from a
temperature-independent resistor. nee)

Thermally driven fluctuations of the voltage across a resistor were discovered experimentally :
by Johnson in 1927 [4,5] and were explained by Nyquist shortly afterwards [6].
