The rate parameter fj representing the analogue to the
Althusian fitness value of X; and kj is the rate parameter for
replication of X; catalysed by X;. We shall refer to the f; values
as fitness parameters and to the kj values as cooperation par-
ameters despite the fact that certain combinations of k;; values
may lead to strong selection, for example the multidimensional
Schlogl model [30,31].

The reaction equation (2.1c) takes into account catalysis
for all n? binary combinations of replicators in the system.
The occurrence of efficient catalysis, however, is a rare
event and accordingly the number of catalytic interactions
in mechanism (2.1aâ€”e) is unrealistically large. In the hyper-
cycle model, catalysis is restricted to a single cooperation
partner. The system shows special properties when mutual
catalysis forms a closed loop
