difficulties in learning how to prove, and the teachers tend not to be successful in their mission to
help the students learn to prove.

The students have difficulty in constructing the arguments necessary to prove, in
understanding the methods of proof and even in understanding what constitutes a proof and
what does not [7]. Actually, the notion of what constitutes a mathematical proof has changed
over time [19] and is not a matter of consensus [20,21]. Bleiler-Baxter & Pair [22, p. 16] follow
de Villiers’s [23] point of view and define proof as ‘logical deduction that is used to verify,
explain, systematize, discover, and communicate mathematics’ (including both the proof as a
written argument and the act of proving). Steele & Rogers [21, p. 161], inspired by previous
work by other authors, define proof as ‘a mathematical argument that is general for a class of
mathematical ideas and establishes the truth of a mathematical statement based on mathematical
facts that are accepted or have been previously proven’. Tall [24, p. 93] notes, ‘though proof is the
central idea of modern mathematics, quite what it is is a matter of implicit, rather than explicit,
agreement between members of the mathematics community’. And Smith [19, p. 75] observes that


proof is often assumed to be ‘a convincing argument’, and that what is accepted as convincing is
determined by the experts, the teacher or the textbook.

Dawkins [25, p. 63] refers to terms such as ‘formal’ and ‘rigorous’ as being closely related to the
meaning of proof; nevertheless these terms are not related to clear definitions of their meanings.
And actually, according to Rocha [1], these are terms usually used by teachers to define proof. That
is the case of the teachers enrolled on a study, who use these terms to characterize mathematical
proof (see the characterization by one of these teachers at the beginning of this section). And the
