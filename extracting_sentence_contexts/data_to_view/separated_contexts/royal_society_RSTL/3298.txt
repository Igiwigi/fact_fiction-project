It appears by the above Table, that the influence of the ring is directly as
the rapidity of the motion, and inversely as the squares of the distances : we
observe a little discrepancy in some of the numbers, but the general agree-
ment is yery close and remarkable. A complete agreement cannot be expected ;
for supposing even the most perfect manipulation, there will always arise in
experiments of this kind many causes which disturb a numerical identity#.

13. Being desirous to extend these inquiries concerning the transient mag-
netic state, of which various substances appear to be susceptible, I subsequently
laid aside the rotating discs, as a means of detecting these minute forces for
the no less refined, and perhaps till less exceptionable method of a vibrating
bar; since what is termed the magnetism of rotation, seems in fact to be

* In estimating the distance between the surfaces of the attracting bodies, the revolving disc was
purposely made as thin as possible, s0 as to admit of its being considered without any sensible thick-
ness. With respect to the magnet, the foregoing experiments with screens clearly show, that an inter-
vening ferruginous mass completely intercepts the attractive force upon non-ferruginous substances. If any portion of the bar beneath the surface contiguous to the revolving body be supposed to operate
upon the ring, such portion must necessarily act through the intervening iron ; which it cannot do
