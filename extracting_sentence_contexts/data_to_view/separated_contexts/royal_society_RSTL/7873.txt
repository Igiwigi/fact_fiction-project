Next, as to the sections where the shearing-forces have zero values. The extremities
of a ship obviously have no shearing-force to resist, and we have seen, in the case of the
* Bellerophon' (fig. 9), that at the sections of water-borne division the shearing-force is
also zero. The condition established in that ship holds for all the other ships I have
taken, and in fact for all ships when floating in still water. In the © Minotaur,” which
is the simplest possible case, there is (neglecting the extremities) only one 8uch 8ection
(a in fig. 8); in the other three ships, when fully laden, there are three such sections,
