The value of (ny, —1) 108
at 0° C and 760 mm. derived from the results of this investigation by means of the
interpolation equations (5-12) and (7-7) is, then, 292-36 for dry, CO,-free air and 292-41
for dry air containing 0-03 °% of CO,. The mean of these two calculated values is

(mp —1) 106 = 292-38,


DISPERSION OF AIR FOR THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM 53

and this agrees fairly closely with the general average of the forty other determinations
quoted above, which include without dis
CO). An examination of Tilton’s collected results by an elementary statistical method
(Sears 1909), dependent, like the use of the arithmetical mean, on treating the in-
dividual results as of equal weight, shows that the position of the arithmetical mean is

inction values for air both with and without

displaced owing to the presence of a few abnormally high values, and that, in fact,
the most probable value derived from the whole collection is (v)—1) 10° = 292-3,,
which is in even closer agreement with the value found in the present investigation. Moreover, this statistical examination produces a probability curve, closely resembling
the theoretical *‘ cocked hat’? curve, which shows no evidence of the double maximum
which would be expected if a periodical variation such as that suggested by ‘Tilton were
present.
