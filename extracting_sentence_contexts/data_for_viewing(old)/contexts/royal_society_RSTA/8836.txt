The molecular heat Es, of the liquid solute comes out curiously high in both cases.
Expressed in calories the molecular heats given above are

KCl. NaCl.
29°5 34°0

According to the law of Dutone and Perir as supplemented by Korp the
molecular heats for the solids are both about 13 cals. Thus the molecular heats for
the liquefied solutes are more than double those of the solids. The same phenomenon
is to be noted in the case of ice, the molecular heat of which is 8°6, whilst that of
liquefied ice is 18, again more than double. In both cases there are no doubt changes
of state with rise of temperature which account for the difference. The figures
seem to point to the fact that the liquefied solutes have like water a complex
molecular structure which is altered by rise of temperature.

23. Analysis of the Specifie Heat of the Solutions—The relations at which we
have arrived enable us to analyse in a simple manner the isothermal changes in
specific heat whicli take place on dilution of a solution,

If we put E grammes of solute into H grammes of water then in one gramme of

grammes of solute and ete grammes of water.
