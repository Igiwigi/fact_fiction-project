Segmentation and the formation of endoderm

The differences between Sedgwick’s description of segmentation in P. capensis and
P. balfouri up to the 8-cell stage and the present account, illustrated by Sedgwick’s (1885)
figures 4 to 6, plate 31, and figures 16 and 62 to 64, plates 31, 36 and 37 here presented, do
not merit a full discussion. Purcell has correctly criticized Sedgwick’s figures, and more
adequate methods have demonstrated that the egg does not segment either ‘completely’ or
‘meroblastically’ as Sedgwick states (1886, 1887), but that the nucleated first blastomere
separates from the non-nucleated cytoplasmic and nutritive part of the egg, and cleaves
independently from the latter.

Stages showing a saddle or disk of superficial blastomeres were observed by Sedgwick and
Purcell, but both considered these cells to be ectodermal only, while in fact they give rise
to all germ layers. Purcell as well as Sedgwick confused the non-nucleated cytoplasmic
spheres of early stages (see Sedgwick 1885, figures 7, 8 and 10 en., plate 31, and figures 62 to
67, plate 37 shown here) with the ‘large vacuolated cells’ derived from the edges of the saddle
of blastomeres (see Sedgwick, figures 11, 12, 13 and 15 en., plate 31 (figures 7, 11 and 12 are
of P. balfouri and figures 8, 10, 13 and 15 are of P. capensis) and the figures on plates 37 and
39 of stages i to k of P. balfourt and figure 120, plate 41 of P capensis here shown).

Sedgwick further supposed that both these components represented endoderm; the large
vacuolated cells in P. capensis do in fact give endoderm, but not in P. balfouri where the
definitive endoderm does not arise until later (see p. 512). He accounted for the nuclei of his
‘endodermal’ cells by supposing that they arose de novo in the non-nucleated cytoplasmic
spheres, so giving the nucleated large vacuolated cells which he correctly observed forming ‘a
