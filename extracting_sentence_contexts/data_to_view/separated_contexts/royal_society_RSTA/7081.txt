Their values for the electric part of the
coefficients agree with ours, but there is a difference in the constants A and B which is
due to the repulsive forces. These authors obtain for A: 10-606, B: 1-073 (cf. (6-4)). This is due to the fact that they use the repulsive potential of Born and Mayer (1932)
for the calculation of these constants, thus neglecting the Van der Waals (London)
forces, which are roughly included in our general expression:

(3) p= (Pes py bz) bs =p; ok a (A Pos Ps)3 p = bo = bs

Clearly, variation of the p; means moving along the main diagonal of the phase space. The following identities hold:
