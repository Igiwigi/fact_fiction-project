If the metals are perfect conductors the effective flow of displacement will
be confined to the surface, and will involve simply a vortex-sheet along the surface
each metal; but if the conducting power is imperfect the disturbance will dif s
itself into the metals, and the final steady condition will be one in which it j
uniformly distributed throughout them, forming an ordinary electric current obeyir
Oun’s law. 68. On the present theory, high specific inductive power in a substance is equi
valent to low electric elasticity of the ether; it in fact stands to reason that
elastic medium whose continuity is broken by the inelastic and mobile portions whic
represent the cores of vortex-atoms may from this cause alone have its effective
elasticity very considerably diminished. Moreover it has been ascertained that, in electrolytic liquids, the specific inductiy
capacity attains very great values; the wether in these media interposes a pro
portionally small resistance to rotation, and the mobility or some other property 6
the vortex-molecules in it has brought it so much the nearer to instability ; it is thu
the easier to see why such media break down under comparatively slight electri
stress. Such a medium also frees itself, as described below, from electric stres
without elastic rupture, in a time short compared with ordinary standards, but i
most instances long compared with the periods of light-vibrations ; while in metalli
media the period of decay of stress is at least of the same order of smallness as
periods of light-waves.
