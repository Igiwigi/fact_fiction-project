However, failures attributed to hydrogen embrittlement (HE)
of oilfield upstream components manufactured using some PH Ni alloys have been reported
in the literature [6-9]. Even though these failures could be classified as hydrogen-environment
embrittlement failures the general term HE has been employed, and is also used in this paper
for referencing the mechanism that involves subcritical cracking at the surface of materials
under sustained loads in hydrogen (H)-bearing environments [10,11]. Despite the fact that HE
susceptibility in PH Ni alloys is a well-known engineering problem [12-15], these failures have
generated questions about both the microstructural characteristics in these alloys as well as the
environmental aspects influencing the failure mechanism during service. Consequently, HE of
oil-patch PH Ni alloys has received, in recent years, increasing scientific attention. Research
efforts have concentrated on developing and implementing testing methodologies capable of
ranking PH Ni alloys in terms of their HE susceptibility.
