Krause (1920) calls the aryteno-cricoid slip of the dilatator ““ M. arylabialis” and
traces it as a fibrous strip into the pars basalis of the vocal cord. A similar muscle is
present in Pseudopaludicola falcipes (p. 432), and, in Megalophrys robusta, what corre-
sponds to a hyo-cricoid slip of the dilatator ends on the membranous wall of the
larynx between arytenoid and cricoid ; so that it is now clear that such a specialization
of the dilatator is neither confined to Rana, nor is it universally present in the genus. The Ranide, in fact, possess a generalized larynx, the only characteristic feature of
which, the apical cartilage, is shared with the related families of the Rhacophoride and
Brevicipitide. The shape of the cricoid exhibits some diversity within the genus Rana. The most
usual shape is that found in R. temporaria, R. kuhlii, R. halecina, etc., in which the
muscular process is a triangular eminence.
