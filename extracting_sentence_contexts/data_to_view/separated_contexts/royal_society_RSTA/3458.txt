* The results of this section were published in the ‘Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical
Society,’ vol. 11, Part IV., 1902. J. W. MEtxor published almost simultaneously the fact that hydrogen
chloride is formed during the momentary illumination producing the initial expansion. He also afterwards
arrived at the conclusion of §5 with regard to the expansion of damp chlorine alone under the influence of
