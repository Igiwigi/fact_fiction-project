The distribution of the outer is related to
that of the scales, they are more numerous over the central regions of the exposed
portions of the scales, scarce along their borders. On the other hand, the deeper
iridocytes which belong to the argenteum are arranged in rows, they are elongated
in shape, and touch one another by their extremities ; the rows again form a loose
net work with irregular meshes. It is evident from the facts thus elucidated, that there is no difference in kind
between the two structures which have been distinguished as _iridocytes and
argenteum. The argenteum in its primitive condition in the Flounder is a collection
of iridocytes. But no case is yet known in which the superficial iridocytes develop
into a continuous layer of argenteum.
