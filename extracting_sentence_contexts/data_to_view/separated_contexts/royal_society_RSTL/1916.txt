If a few drops of dilute hydrocyanic acid be placed upon the tongue of a
frog, a state of things the reverse of that just described as the effect of opium
or strychnine is induced: the contractions which depend on the reflex function
are observed to become less and less energetic and excitable, and at length
cease altogether. * Having observed these facts in connexion with the reflex function, it became a question whether
the rigidity of the muscles immediately consequent to death depends upon the same principle. Two
rabbits were killed; in one the spinal marrow was destroyed, in the other it was left entire. Both,
however, became equally rigid.
