not a single definite layer. But in Selaginella,1 at any rate for the most part, the
tapetum is cut off from the sporogenous group itself. The case of Isoetes is peculiar,
and shows how indefinite the origin of a functional tapetum may be... In the
microsporangia the tapetum “is organised out of that layer of the sterile cells,
whether of wall or of trabeculee, which is in contact with the fertile cells ;** it
remains persistent till the maturity of the spores. In the megasporangium “the
only difference is the greater abundance of the tapetum in the megasporangium. No
doubt a considerable part of it is derived from the unsuccessful mother-cells.¢¢ In
the Leptosporangiate Ferns the tapetum is derived as a series of segments from the
central (archesporial ?) cell; this is the case even for the large sporangia of the
Gleicheniaceze and Osmundaceve.{{

From these facts it appears that cells acting functionally as special nutritive cells—
either disappearing by early disorganisation (“ plasmodialtapete,’ of GorBEL), or
persisting till the. spores are mature (“secretionstapete,” of GoEBEL)—may be
scattered through the sporogenous mass, or derived from the tissues lying outside it,
or be cut off from the sporogenous cell or group of cells. Their similarity is in
function, not in origin : the origin from the wall, or from the sporogenous group, may
vary within the single sporangium, as in Jsoetes or Selaginella, There is even good
reason to recognise progressive changes of origin of the tapetum within certain circles
of affinity ; thus, in the Lycopodium sporangia the definite tapetum is derived from
the sporangial wall, in the smaller sporangia of Selaginella, chiefly from the sporo-
