Such
experiments, in short, do not enable us to state with certainty the temperature at which
an infusion is sterilized, because the germs which most pertinaciously oppose sterilization
may not belong to the infusion at all, but to the adjacent air.

. The most astonishing cases of resistance to sterilization observed by
Wraax were associated with this particular mode of experiment. The
possible action of the uncleansed air, moreover, was in his case augmented
by the fact that he employed quantities of liquid, very small in comparison
with the size of his flascks, In some of his earlier experiments the yohume
of air was more than thirty times that of the infusion. These relative
volumes -are represented in the annexed figure (fig. 7), copied from

Wraax's Memoir of 1862, ES==
