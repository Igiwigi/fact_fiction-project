In those cases where such an additional amount o}
sperma was added as to render the water putrid, the arm lengths are considerabl
decreased, but otherwise they are probably not influenced either by a decrease or a
increase in the amount present. Though the evidence drawn from the variations produced in the arm lengths of th
larvee is not nearly so trustworthy as that for the body length, probably because o
the greater sensitiveness of the tissues of the arms to slight changes in the environ
ment, yet the number of different observations made in several cases affords a con
siderable degree of certainty to some of the conclusions arrived at. Probably the
most striking point of these conclusions lies in the fact that opposite effects on thi
arm and body lengths are frequently produced by the same change of environmental
condition. The effects brought about by rise of temperature and dilution of the watet
during development are especially noticeable. Both the aboral and oral arm lengths of the larvee were determined, in order that
the effect of environment on the relation between the two might be examined.
