Received May 7, 1873. Since the foregoing was written an explanation has suggested itself for the very con-
siderable divergence (more than could fairly be ascribed to errors of observation) of our
heat-curve from Professor Z6LUXER's light-curve for change of phase, which will at the
same time account for the increase of the percentage of heat transmitted by glass towards
the time of full moon. Were it not for the negative result obtained with the thermopile on March 24th, 1871*,
the latter fact might perhaps have been attributed to a consrant amount of heat emitted
from the interior of the moon ; but now this explanation is no longer admissible. On referring to the Table at page 615 of the foregoing paper, it will be seen that the
percentage of heat transmitted by glass increases gradually from each side to a maximum
at or near the time of full moon ; consequently the phase-curve for © heat through glass i

will rise more rapidly towards full moon than the total heat-curve, and should therefore
diverge less from Z6LLNER's than the total heat-curve, when the ordinates are increased
by a suitable factor.
