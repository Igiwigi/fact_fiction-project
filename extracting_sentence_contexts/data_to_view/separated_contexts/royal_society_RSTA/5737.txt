Both systems after that were evolving in complete
harmony. What is remarkable about this result is that the receiver managed somehow to reconstruct the
remaining signal of the transmitter, that is the y’,z’ part, by using only part of it: the variable
x’. In some cases, it was later found that sync may in fact proceed exponentially rapidly [51]. By using this method and after the work of [40] for the Lorenz and the Réssler systems, many
chaotic dynamical systems have been found that allow for synchronization, a truly remarkable
phenomenon that has since provided the key to many previously unresolved mysteries in
nonlinear dynamics (for more details, we refer to the books [52,53], and the recent review [41]).

(b) Syncin cosmology

Because of relativistic causality, any two spatial points A,B in an inhomogeneous cosmological
space-time may influence each other by sending signals in a one-way manner, A can only
influence B if it lies in B’s causal past, and B can only influence points on or inside its future
null cone. Inspired by [40], we may think of two Mixmaster points A, B influencing each other as
a ‘transmitter-receiver pair’ (‘master-slave’, or ‘driving-response’), and examine the possibility of
whether some form of sync may develop between them.
