W. WHEWELL ON TIDE OBSERVATIONS

sponding to two such passages, the inequality increases from 0 to a maximum, and
decreases to 0 again ; after which it again increases. The curves which represent the heights do, in fact, exhibit snch alternate increase
and diminution of the diurnal inequality : and the inquiry naturally occurs, After how
long a time does the moon's position show its effect in the diurnal inequality? In
the case of Liverpool it appears, as I have pointed out *, that the diurnal inequality
expresses the effect of the forces (upon the equilibrium-spheroid) as they existed six
days previously. It is important to know whether this interval is the same in other
places.
