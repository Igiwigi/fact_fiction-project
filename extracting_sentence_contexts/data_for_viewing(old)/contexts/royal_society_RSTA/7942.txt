The lower state differences for »” = 0,1, and 2 are collected in Table III. There are
three sets of values for v” = 0 (v’ = 9-11) seven for v” = 1 (v' = 8-14) and two for
vy" =2(v' = 10,11). The order of agreement between the respective sets gives some
indication of the accuracy of the original wave numbers. As has already been pointed
out, this is rather low on account of the prevalence of blending, deviations from the
mean of about 0-1 cm being quite frequent, but by using suitable methods it has never-
theless been possible to derive accurate values of the rotation constants. The upper
state differences, R(J) — P (J), have not been tabulated.

The usual expression for the rotation terms is of the form F (J) = BJ (JJ +1)+
DJ? (J + 1)2, with higher terms in J if required. In this case they are not, and, in fact,
D is so small that it was found impossible to determine it satisfactorily from the
differences themselves. They are given by

FU +1)—-FG —1) = +2) (B+ 2D(+I+0)
A preliminary value of B was first obtained by dividing each difference by (43 + 2).
Since D is very small, these quotients tend to a constant value (2.e., B) as J decreases.
D was then calculated for each vibration state in the following manner. The value, D,.
appropriate to the equilibrium state of the molecule was first obtained from the expression

D.=— 1 D, was then calculated from the formule
