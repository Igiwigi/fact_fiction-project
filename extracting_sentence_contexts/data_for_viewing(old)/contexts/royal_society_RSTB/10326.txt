the interaction. How these practices are realized is informed by
the socio-cultural contexts [15], but recognizably same practices
can be found across those contexts: as Goffman puts it, ‘ped-

as crowded streets, interruption rights at breakfast as well as
in courtrooms, endearment vocatives in supermarkets as well
as in the bedroom’ ([2], p. 2).

The other organization from which the interaction order dis-
tinguishes itself consists of the individuals participating in
interaction. The operational closure of the interaction shows
up in the way in which the rules and practices of social inter-
action are ‘social facts’: highly conventionalized and rooted in
strong social norms. While all their realizations take place
through individuals’ actions that require cognitive, emotional,
perceptual and attentional competences, the rules and practices

and individual differences (e.g. [4,16]). In social encounters,
they both enable and constrain the participating individuals’
actions, thereby generating the identity of the interaction as a
self-organized system, which cannot be reduced to things like
individual actors’ communicative intentions.

While interaction as an autonomous system differentiates
itself from the environment, it does not isolate itself. In the en-
