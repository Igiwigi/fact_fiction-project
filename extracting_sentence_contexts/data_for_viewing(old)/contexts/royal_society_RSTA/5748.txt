It is written here using the operator of infinitesimal rotation J, =e x 0/de. Without a doubt,
the assumed constancy of the length of the antiferromagnetic vector does not mean that its
orientation kinetics is described by Brown’s equation. Recall that this equation is valid, strictly
speaking, only for a system whose regular magnetodynamics is described by the Landau-
Lifshitz—Gilbert equation. The choice of (3.1) as a theoretical basis, in fact, implies that rotations of
the antiferromagnetic vector has the same character as the motion of the magnetization vector of
each of the sublattices. Nevertheless, one should be aware that this approach is rather simplistic.
In particular, it is known that in general case a dynamic equation for the AFM vector includes a
term proportional to the second time derivative, see, for example, refs. [21,22], in contrast to the
Landau-Lifshitz—Gilbert equation. However, if a reference frequency of the field variations is low
enough (much less than the inverse decay time of the precession of the sublattices magnetization
vectors), all effects, except for the relaxation ones, can be neglected. Then phenomenologically,
the motion of the AFM vector can be represented as a process of relaxation to the direction of
the instantaneous effective field Hg « U/de. Accordingly, the kinetics of the AFM vector under
conditions of thermal agitations obeys equation (3.1) (in the specified form it is just right valid in
the regime when precession is not significant).
