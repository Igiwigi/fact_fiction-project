for a long distance amongst the fibres of connective tissne, between or upon the ele-
mentary fibres. Many of the bundles of dark-bordered fibres above alluded to can
only be detected in well-prepared specimens which have been soaked for some time in
glycerine, 80 that the muzcular fibres may be separated from each other without rupture
of the nerve-fibres or capillaries.

Again, numerous branches of nerve-fibres, composed of two, three, or four dark-bordered
fibres, may be seen ramifying and dividing near the tendinous extremities of the muscular
fibres of the mylo-hyoid muscle of the frog. Several branches can be followed from
the central tendon as far as the central part of the fibres; and often very fine fibres can
be seen passing amongst the fibres for some distance and forming networks or plexuses.

But there is another fact against the view that the nerves are distributed to only a
very small portion of the elementary muscular fibres of the frog. In certain parts of
the pectoral muscle new muscular fibres are being developed, as K6LLIKER has men-
tioned, and here in a comparatively small space may be seen elementary fibres varying
very much in length and diameter. The thickest of these narroy fibres, according to
my measurements, are often not more than the xg55th of an inch in width, and the
thinnest not more than the -,;;th of an inch in diameter: some are as long as the
other muscular fibres ; but often single spindle-shaped fibres with two or three nuclei, or
more elongated fibres the nuclei of which have divided 80 as to form a row of perhaps
ten or more, may be found. A large nerve-fibre, generally composed of two large dark-
bordered nerye-fibres in the same sheath, with finer fibres, can be followed to the oval
swelling situated amongst the ordinary muscular fibres; and one or two dark-bordered
fibres /eave the swelling to be distributed on more distant muscular fibres. The dark-
