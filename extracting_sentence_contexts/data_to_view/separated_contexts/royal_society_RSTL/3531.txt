The solar image in that ray is
far better defined than in the yellow in question. But from many phenomena ob-
served in the action of coloured glasses I was led to suspect, and the suspicion was
borne out by the results, that this ray may be considered as marking a sort of che-
mical centre, a point of equilibrium, or rather of change of action, in the spectrum. In fact, in a large proportion of the preparations submitted to the action of the spec-
trum, that action, as far as it is marked on the paper by traces of darkness, termi-
nates precisely, or very nearly indeed, at this point, allowing for the sun's diameter.
