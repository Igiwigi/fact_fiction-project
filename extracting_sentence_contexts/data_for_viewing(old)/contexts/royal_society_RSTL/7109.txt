Arranged i in rows or straight lines, the nuclei lying in adjacent lines will be moving in
Spposite directions. During the formation of a muscle these masses undergo division
two directions, longitudinally and transversely. The two masses which result from
{A division of one will pass in opposite directions.
S As is well known, the position of these nuclei with respect to the formed muscular
aus is very different in different cases. Sometimes they are in the very centre of
The elementary fibre, as in the constantly-growing fibres of the heart, sometimes upon
s surface only, sometimes distributed at very equal distances throughout its sub-
nee. Wherever these nuclei are 8ituated new muscular tiswe may be produced,
Jud it is only in these situations that muscular tissue ever is produced ; s0 that by the
TDPosition of the nuclei we learn the seat of formation of new muscle at different periods
Sf life.
X The facts which I regard as favourable to the view above expressed concerning the
ovements of the masses of germinal matter of muscle, are derived from many sources,
but I will refer to some observed in the case of the muscles of the papillze of the tongue.
Here the muscular fibre is very thin and delicate, and yery fayourable for observation.
The mass of germinal matter is very much wider than the muscle. Often three or four
of these masses are seen close together (Plate XXL. fig. 9), while for some distance above
and below the muscular fibre is destitute of nuclei. The narrowest extremity of the
oval mass_ is directed in s8ome cases towards the terminal extremity of the muscle, in
others towards its base. There are often three or four fine fibres branching off from one
stem, and gradually tapering into fine threads towards their insertion at the summit of
the papilla (Plate XXI. figs. 1 & 9). The nuclei are three or four times as wide as these
fibres, The greatest difference is observed in the distance between contiguous nuclei
