We explore values for the isotropic modulus v and the surface tension «
using Onsager’s theory of rigid rods [24]. Finally, by finding the optimal size of the disordered
core and matching its imaging value, we complete the selection of the effective coefficients of the
model for a set of four viruses. Among the most relevant shortcomings of the proposed model, we mention the fact that
the distance, d, between neighbouring DNA segments within the ordered region of the capsid
is not constant. In the case of toroidal domains, this has been pointed out in recent work by
Barberi et al. [25]. Such a distance is also very sensitive to changes in ionic conditions [26].
