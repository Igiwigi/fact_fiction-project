Using some form of the axiom of choice, one
can within another quarter of a page derive that X contains a countable subset. However, the
result is obviously wrong without such an assumption. In fact, Paul Cohen constructed models of
ZF where infinite sets do not have to be Dedekind infinite. In other words, any such fake ‘proof’,
that does not make explicit mention of the axiom of choice, is grossly misleading.

e There is no general consensus as to who was the first to give a correct and complete proof
of d’Alembert’s 1746 theorem that C is algebraically closed (FTHA). Subsequent proofs
were proposed by Euler in 1759 and by Lagrange in 1771.
