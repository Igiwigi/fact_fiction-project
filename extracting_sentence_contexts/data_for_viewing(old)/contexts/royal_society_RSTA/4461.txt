simulations were conducted for each membrane over a range of pressures, from 5MPa up to
400 MPa. This allows for results to be obtained at pressures comparable to the standard conditions
in most reverse osmosis desalination plants and to determine how the flux and rejection change
with hydrostatic pressure.

Figure 3b shows an example of how the salt rejection varies with pressure. At high pressures, : =
the (8,8) tubes display modest ion rejection, while the (10,10) and (12,12) tubes show very little : =
rejection. However, as the pressure decreases, the salt rejection in each case increases; the (8,8) [3
membranes reject nearly all CI” and 90% of Na*, (10,10) membranes reject about 90% of Cl~ and : =
60% Nat and the (12,12) membranes show a 50-80% Cl~ and 20-40% Na* rejection. A similar : a
response is seen in each membrane analysed in this study. The greater rejection of CI” than Nat ia
in prisitine CNTs has been described previously [21,23] and occurs due to a greater barrier for Cl~ : =
entry. This larger barrier is due to the fact that more of the solvation shell must be removed from : =I
the larger Cl” ion compared to the smaller Nat ion in order to enter the pore [21]. : s

The greater salt rejection at low pressures can be explained by considering the free energy 1S

profile of an ion and a water molecule travelling through the membrane. We have previously
shown that the origin of salt rejection in narrow pristine nanotubes originates from the energetic
cost of fully or partially dehydrating the ions as required for the solvated ions to enter the narrow
pores [17,21,30,31]. Similar dehydration barriers exist for water moving from bulk into the narrow
pores as there can be a loss or rearrangement of hydrogen bonds. The net salt rejection of these
suitably narrow pores therefore comes from comparing the relative sizes of the energy barriers
seen by ions and water and how this compares to the driving forces acting to ‘push’ the molecules
into the nanotube. The energetic barrier of entry for both Nat and Cl~ is significantly larger
