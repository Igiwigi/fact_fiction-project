The intermittent lamps were placed close to the stirrer, and thus the whole
arrangement tended to keep the oscillations of the temperature within narrow limits. At some temperatures we had thermometers by which we could detect changes
of sso C., but when the apparatus was working satisfactorily we at no time observed
oscillations of this magnitude. Another circumstance which perhaps assisted in diminishing the oscillations was
the fact that the stirring was sufliciently vigorous to cause a continual vibration of
the U-tube of the thermostat and so prevent any adhesion of the mercury to the
platinum point which established connection with the relay. Srorron X.

tank (@) and the fall being observed by means of bridge-wire observations, it was
stopped when it had passed below the range of the bridge.
