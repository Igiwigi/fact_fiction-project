pits were found in the field, and sometimes one small pit and one larger, oblique,

elliptical pit. The arrangement of the pit suggests the possibility that the larger

ones have in the course of descent been derived from a fusion of smaller ones. There

was no sign of any border to these pits, and, in view of the fact that the pores

in the tracheids are clearly preserved, one is led to believe that they were probably

simple. The pits were possibly similar to the “eiporen” found in the genus Pinzs. VOL, COXIL—B. 0
