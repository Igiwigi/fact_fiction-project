258 PROFESSOR FORBES ON THE EXTINCTION OF THE SOLAR RAYS

at the suggestion of M. Bior, of which the latter has given an elaborate analysis*.
Now when the curves of intensity of transmitted heat are projected in terms of the
thickness of the transmitting medium, it appears that the rate of extinction is much
more rapid at first, becomes continually slower, and long before the curve has reached
the axis, or the heat has been wholly absorbed, it runs parallel to the axis without
ever approaching it ; in other words, it has an asymptote parallel to, but at a distance
from the axis. This corresponds to the physical fact, that when heat has been already
transmitted through a great thickness of any medium, provided it be mechanically
pure, an increase of thickness will produce little or no extinction.

86. The cases of extinction which T have most narrowly considered are those of
lamp-heat, heat from incandescent platinum, and dark heat, through glass. These
curves are projected in Plate XXIV., the ordinates representing the intensities of heat
transmitted at different thicknesses, the incident heat being unity, but which is re-
duced to '925 according to MrerLLonr, by reflection at the two bounding surfaces.
The existence of an asymptote or final value of the transmitted heat in every one of
these cases is abundantly evident, and this would be one of the constants (variable
for different media) which would determine the equations to the curves, which might
be expected to be of one species. There is, however, the utmost difficulty in repre-
