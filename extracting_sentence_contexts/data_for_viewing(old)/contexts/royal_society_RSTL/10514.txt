purely animal pigment. :

The other violet pigment referred to by KRUKENBERG is probably the actinio-
chrome of Professor MoseLEv. In some specimens the apices of the tentacles are
tinged of a violet colour, which showed the actiniochrome spectrum well marked,
spectrum 6, Charb IV. The glycerin extract of the tentacles of some specimeng of
Anthea cereus, after 80me days' extraction, gives a solution which, although only
yellowish-red, possesses a magnificent emerald-green fluorescence. I have no doubt
that this is the pigment whose bands are seen in the almost colourless tentacle after
removal of the yellow cells, as it gives a band in blue and in the violet, spectrum 15,
Chart IV., besides the first. They read : 1st, X 582 to A 560 ; 2nd, X 5205 to X 506 ;
3rd, X 4945 to A 475. The first band probably belongs to a trace of actiniohzematin.
That this fluorescent pigment was not a 80-called © lipochrome ” is shown by the fact
that, on adding caustic soda, one of the bands near the violet end disappeared, while
with acetic acid the second and third bands appeared merged into one.

Summary and Remarks.

The above observations show that a respiratory colouring matter is present in
Actima mesembryanthemum, Bunodes crassicornts, and other Actinie. That it mus
be respiratory is shown by the fact that one of its decomposition products is capable
of existing in a state of oxidation and reduction. That it is closely related to hamo-
globin is shown by the results attending my attempts to convert ib into hamochromogen
and hematoporphyrin, as the pigments corresponding to these, obtained from the
above Actiniz, are undistinguishable from those obtained from hazmoglobin.
