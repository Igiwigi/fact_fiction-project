It has been shown in previous sections that the eye has the same, or nearly the same,
high acuity for white, red, green and blue lights. Further, Shlaer, Smith & Chase have
shown, with a grating test object, that the same statement was true for lights of practically
all colours. It has been shown, moreover, that the same, or nearly the same, acuity is
found, whatever the direction taken either by the lines of the grating or of the gap in the C.
But our own everyday experiences show us that these conclusions are not limited to the
particular test objects used during these experiments, since they apply to letters, to numbers
and to objects of all kinds, and of various shapes and sizes.

How are we to explain this high acuity for lights of all colours? This is difficult enough
on the triple-receptor plan, but almost impossible on the poly-receptor plan of Granit.
Clearly, the hypothesis which most easily fits in with the observed facts is the single-
receptor plan. For, according to this, no matter what the colour of the light may be, every
receptor is capable of responding. Nevertheless, there are grave difficulties in the way of
the acceptance of this plan, into which it is not proposed to enter in detail here; but it is,
for example, contrary to the results of Granit’s experiments. It seems most unlikely that
man’s retina is fundamentally different in design from that of other mammals.

According to the cluster hypothesis, either by accident or by some factor acting during
growth, receptors of a given variety tend to collect together. Thus at Gne point of the retina
there may be a cluster of Granit’s ‘dominators’; at another, there may be a group of
green-sensitive receptors; while at a third point there may be some blue-sensitive ones.
According to the cluster hypothesis, this uneven distribution is made use of in the following
manner.
