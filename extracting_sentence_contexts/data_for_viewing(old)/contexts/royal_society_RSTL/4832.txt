perfectly in accordance with all the observations recorded, and had been submitted
to the test of experiment in 80 many directions, that no doubt was left in my mind
regarding their correctness. Still, the former inquiry had elicited several facts which
I was unable to explain by the view which I had taken. These facts I bave since
endeavoured to elucidate by additional experiments; the results detailed in the fol-
lowing pages, I am happy to say, are in perfect accordance with my former obserya-
tions, the extension of which has led me, at the same time, to a till more general
conception of the question.

After having succeeded in replacing, step by step, one, two or three equivalents of
hydrogen in ammonia by a corresponding number of compound atoms, the question
arose whether the agent by which these changes were fected would exert a still
farther influence upon the last product of the reaction. In order to decide this ques-
tion by experiment, I submitted two nitrile-bases, diethylaniline and triethylamine,
to a prolonged action of bromide of ethyl. These experiments, of which a full ac-
count is given in my preceding memoir (pages 106 and 122), did not lead to per-
