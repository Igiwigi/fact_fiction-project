the organic structure of the s0-called ganoid scale-bones in 1840, both in recent and
extinct fishes, showing that it militated against the theory of the development by
8uccessive deposition of layers being applied, at least to ganoid scales.” A reference
is made to the © Odontography,” p. 15, where I find the following foot-note :—* A very
close analogy exists between the dermal bony tubercles and spines of the cartilagi-
nous fishes and their teeth. The system of minute parallel tubes, with their branches
and anastomoses in the thick scales of the extinct Lepidotus, is as complicated as in
many teeth, and equally militates against the theory of transndation of layers being
applied, at least to ganoid seales.” The new facts brought forward by Professor
Owex are some observations on the opercular and other bones of the Carp and Gold-
fish, from which he concludes that the opercalar bones are not modified dermal
scales; the remaining illustrations had already been developed by M. Acass1z, both
in his descriptions and by his drawings®. The last writer who has alluded to the snbject is Mr.
