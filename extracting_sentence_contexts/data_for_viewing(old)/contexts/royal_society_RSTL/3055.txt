curiosity, to speculate how far the unexplained virtues attributed to certain
mineral waters depend on the presence of these- ingredients, the energy of
whose action may perhaps compensate for the minute quantity in which they
are found. I confess, indeed, that with regard to the former of them, Todine,
we ought to be sceptical as to any medicinal agency that can be exerted by s0
small a quantity as a single grain diffused through ten gallons of water, the
largest proportion in which I have ever detected it. But with respect- to the
second, Bromine, after considering the statements of its discoverer M. BaLarp,
as to its highly poisonous operation upon animals, which my own experience

absurd to trace the medical yirtues ascribed to 8uch waters as those of Ashby-
de-la-Zouch, to the presence of eyen 80 small a quantity as a grain of hydro-
bromate of magnesia (if such be the combination) in each pint of the water ;
and that the proportion would not fall far short of that, my experiments on this
particular spring seem to warrant me in concluding. It is curious at least,
that almost the only two brine-springs, properly s0 called, which have acquired
