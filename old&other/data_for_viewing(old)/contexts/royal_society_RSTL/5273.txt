cases perfectly identical, and that the fifth snbstance produced by the action of acids
is replaced in the case of alkalies by another, which, though perfectly distinct, is 80
Similar both in properties and composition, that it may be considered as in every
respect its equivalent.

Action of Ferments on Rubian.—lIt has long been suspected by chemists that the
colouring matter of madder owes its formation to some process of fermentation, but
the exact nature of the process has hitherto remained unknown. Mr. Hiccin first
pointed out the fact, that a formation of colouring matter takes place even during
the short period occupied in the process of dyeing, and he attributes it to the
action of some albuminous snbstance contained in madder on xanthine. That some
process of decomposition takes place on extracting madder with cold or tepid water
and exposing the extract to a moderate temperature, is proved by the fact that the
extract, if concentrated, becomes after some time thick and gelatinous ; and that the
process of decomposition takes effect chiefly on the rubian is apparent, since the
extract, after it has become gelatinous, is found to have lost its bitter taste and the
greater part of its yellow colour.

In order to prepare the peculiar substance contained in madder which has the
property of effecting the decomposition of rubian, I proceed in the following manner.
A quantity of madder having been placed on a piece of calico or fine canvas, there is
poured on it for every pound of madder taken about four quarts of distilled water,
which may be either cold or of a temperature of about 38” C. The latter temperature
is preferable, as the water then percolates more rapidly. To the extract there is
added, without any delay, about an equal volume of alcohol, which causes the separa-
