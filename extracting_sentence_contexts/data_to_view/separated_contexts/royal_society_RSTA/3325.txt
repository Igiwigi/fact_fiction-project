However, the general conclusion is that direct reduction of the TiO or ZrOz supports
does not occur by simple deposition of the Ru metal. We have also considered an alternative process, reduction of the oxide by the effect of an
oxygen reverse spillover. In fact, in the presence of a metal nanoparticle, O atoms may diffuse
from the oxide surface to the metal, leaving behind an oxygen vacancy, with consequent reduction
of the oxide. This is the initial step of what is often referred to as strong metal-support interaction. The thermodynamic cost to displace an O atom from the (101) surface of TiO2 and ZrO2 in the
presence of a Ru nanoparticle has been estimated: it is very small, about 0.2eV, on TiOz, and
moderate, about 0.6 eV, on ZrO.
