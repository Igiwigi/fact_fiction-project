Diſtance there is not enough left to make an exploſion.
E It is equally eaſy to explain what happens when a
Zranſverſe arm is hung ſo as to oſcillate freely upon the
prime conductor, and two equal cylinders of tin-foil are
:Zuſpended, one at each end of this arm in perfect equi-
Sbrio with each other. The apparatus being in this ſtate,,
2f the machine be worked, the two cylinders will remain
Rationary, neitherofthem aſcending or deſcending. They
Fl alſo remain ſtationary, if a point be preſented to one;
Jad arounded end to the other. In the firſt caſe they are
| Elecrificd, but remain motionleſs, becauſe there is no con
Fudting body within the ſphere of their action. In the
Fecond, the reſult is the ſame; becauſe, making in fact
'Sart of the prime conductor, the point preſented to one
'of them prevents any accumulation of electricity. When
the point is withdrawn, and the rounded end ſuffered to
remain, an accumulation takes place, becauſe there is
nothing now to ſteal it away; and the conſequence is,
ſs the cylinder deſcends towards the rounded end, and
| explodes.

explodes as ſoon as that accumulation arrives at a certain
period.
