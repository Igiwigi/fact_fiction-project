2357. These solutions supply a very important means of advancing magnetical
investigation, for they present us with the power of making a magnet, which is at
the same time liquid, transparent, and within certain limits, adjustible to any degree

of strength. Hence the power of examining a magnet optically. Hence also, the
capability of placing magnetic portions of matter one within another, and s0 observing
dynamic and other phenomena within magnetic media. In fact, not only may these
substances be placed as magnets in the magnetic field, but the field generally may
be filled with them, and then other hodies and other magnets examined as to their
joint or separate actions in it (2361., &c.).

2358. In reference to the salts of nickel and cobalt, pure crystals of the sulphate of
nickel were found to be well magnetic, and also pure crystals of sulphate of cobalt.
Solutions of the sulphate of nickel, the chloride of nickel, and the chloride of cobalt,
were also magnetic. That I might be perfectly safe in these conclusions I applied
to Mr. AsKNn of Birmingham, whose power'of separating nickel and cobalt from each
other and other metals is well known, as also the scale upon which he carries on
these operations, and he favoured me with a 80lution of chloride of nickel, and another
of chloride of cobalt perfectly pure, both of which proved to be well magnetic be-
