It can be seen from the simulation results that the
trajectories of the perturbed system (i.e. d(t) 4 03) remain close to those of the unperturbed system
(i.e. d(t) = 03), as predicted by the ISS property. Moreover, in line with the observations made in [30,31], figure 2a shows that the required
damping increases with the machine loading and the excitation magnitude. This is consistent with
the well-known power-angle characteristic that can be employed for reduced-order SG models

3The scaling factor 3 in J and D originates from the following fact. In [2], the mechanical equation (2.5) is expressed in pu
with respect to the three-phase base power Sy. Hence, the pu values of J, D, Tm and T. are also expressed with respect to 536.
