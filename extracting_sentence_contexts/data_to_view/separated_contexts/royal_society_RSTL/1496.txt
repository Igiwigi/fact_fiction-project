But synthesis of natural products, although required in
strict chemical demonstration, is (as we have but too often
occasion to know) 'seldom to be attained, especially when
operations are performed on bodies whose component parts
are liable to an infinite series of variations in their proportions,
qualities, and mode of combination. Considering therefore, that bitumen and resin afford by
certain operations similar products, that resin and bitumen
are found blended together by nature, and that this mixed
substance accompanies a species of coal which in many parts
$till exhibits its vegetable origin, whilst in others it passes
into pit-coal, we may with the greatest probability conclude,
that bitumen is a modification of the resinous and oily parts of
vegetables, produced by some process of nature, which has
operated by slow and gradual means on immense masses, $0
that even if we were acquainted with the process, we. should
scarcely be able to imitate its effects, from the-want of time,
and deficiency in the bulk of materials. But although bitumen cannot at present be artificially

formed from the resinous and other vegetable substances by
any of the known chemical processes, yet there is every
reason to believe, that the agent employed by nature in the
formation of coal and bitumen has been either muriatic or
sulphuric acid ; and when it is considered, that common salt
is never found in coal mines except when in the vicinity of
salt springs, whilst on the contrary, pyrites, sulphate of iron,
and alum, most commonly are present;* these facts, together
with the suIphureous odour emitted by most of the mineral
coals when burned, appear strongly to eyince the agency of
the latter. That this has been the case, seems also to be
corroborated, by the great resemblance which (as has been
previously stated) the coals formed artificially from many
vegetable substances bear to the mineral coals, especially as
the similarity is not confined to external characters, but extends
to other properties. By the action of sulphuric acid on vegetable bodies, a much
greater portion of their carbon is converted into coal than
when the same are subjected to the effects of fire.
