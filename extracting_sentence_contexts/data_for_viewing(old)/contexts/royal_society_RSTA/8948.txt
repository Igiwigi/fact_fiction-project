various possible sources. The formula gives so closely the values of the lines for D,,
from m = 1 tom =7 that there can be little doubt as to the essential correctness of
the D,, allocation. The limit of the series cannot then be very different from S (©).

(1) Is 788 a real separation—v.e., is it produced by a displacement on 8, () by a
larger oun multiple—in this case of 4446 in place of 443% If so the separation would
be 4°52 greater, or 791 instead of 788, and such an explanation is therefore quite
inadmissible.

(2) Is it a b link modified by displacement? If D() be as found, i.e., (—4,)8(),
v, will be increased by “09 or 786°45 to 786'54—an inappreviable change. To produce
a change of 2 in the value of 6b or », the limit would have to be (—5d)S,(), which
gives a value 88°5 above S(o). But, as a fact, the limit found is quite close to
§,(). This explanation is therefore excluded.

(3) Are these displacements on the d sequences? In the normal case the
d sequences for a given satellite triplet are the same, but are displaced from one
satellite set to another. Is it possible that the sequences suffer displacement in the
same triplet also? Take, for example, the satellite set whose first line is 20669.
The sequent is d = 51655-20669 = 30986'20 = N/(1'881350)’. A displacement of
—d, on the denominator 1°881 increases d by 2°06. If the displacement is on the
first line of the triplet it must be —d,, if on the second +4¢,, and both give practically
the same value 788°51 for the apparent separation in general agreement with the
observed value. There is nothing, however, to show whether the displacement should
be —4, on the d, or +6, on both d., d,, as the observed 308°82 is within our assumed
