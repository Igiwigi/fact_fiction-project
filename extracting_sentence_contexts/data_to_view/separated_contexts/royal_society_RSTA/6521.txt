In the related subject of quantum cryptography, however, practical
devices are already at hand (Mosca et al., Millennium II). Moving from the tiny scales, where quantum effects most usually make their
mark, to astronomical and cosmological dimensions, we find, still, that we can by no
means ignore the extraordinary effects of quantum mechanics. Remarkably, the con-
sequences of the intrinsically quantum-mechanical phenomenon of maser action have

een observed in astrophysical situations (in fact, some 35 years ago). The source of
hese effects was subsequently explained, and such things are now used as an astro-
hysical observational tool (Gray, Millennium I). Moreover, the subject of cosmology,
which is concerned with the largest distances of all, cannot be studied theoretically
in a modern and satisfactory way without addressing the role of quantum mechan-
ics.
