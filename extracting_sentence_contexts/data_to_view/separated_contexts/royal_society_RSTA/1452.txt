It thus appears that
in the normal state of the ionised atom, and probably also in the neutral atom, the
13th electron moves in a 3, orbit. The second ionisation potential of silicon, deduced from the above value of Ir,
in the usual manner, is 16-27 volts. Comparison of Si II and Al Tf,

In accordance with the spectroscopic displacement law, it was to be expected that
the series of Si II would be found to be generally similar to those of Al I. Both
spectra are, in fact, constituted of doublets, and differ chiefly in the wider separation
of the pairs in Si IT, and in the displacement of lines of Si II to the region of much
shorter wave-lengths as compared with corresponding lines of Al I. This, of course,
is due to the greater charge of the “ core,” or “ atomic residue,” with respect to the
series electron in the case of Si II as compared with that of Al I.

Comparison of Chief Lines.—Some of the corresponding lines of the two spectra are
indicated in Table IT. Taste I.—Comparison of Chief Lines of Si IT and Al I.
