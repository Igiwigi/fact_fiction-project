More recently, a lot of interest was attracted by pinning control where only a fraction of the
nodes are affected by control. Important contributions in pinning control were made by Chen
and co-workers [69-71,118]. In fact, feasibility question for the pinning control is an issue of
controllability of the network. Such a question may be generalized and one may ask when
the specified structure of the network is controllable. Such a question got a broader attention
after the paper [119].
