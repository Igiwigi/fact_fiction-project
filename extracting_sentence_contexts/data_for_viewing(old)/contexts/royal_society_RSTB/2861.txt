also in the spike of Ophioglossum, and the specimens represented in my Plates 8 and 9
(‘ Studies,’ IT.), show how nearly the supposed branchings in Cheirostrobus may be
matched. A certain degree of parallelism is also seen between the complexity of the
sporophylls and the appendages, which comes out more plainly still in the next
series, viz., the Ophioglossaceze.

(3). THe Type OF THE OPHIOGLOSSACE®,

There seems good reason to believe that the Sphenophylleze were homosporous,
though this is not decisively proved. The Ophioglossaces are also homosporous,
with their spore-bearing organs occupying typically the same position, higher or
lower, on the adaxial face of the sporophyll as that in the Lycopods, Psilotacez,
and Sphenophylle. The facts have been stated, and their bearings discussed at
length elsewhere; a short summary will therefore suffice, with a reference to the
former Memoir.*

The whole question of the relations of this family turns upon whether they be
regarded as an ascending or a descending series. Those who look upon them as a
series of reduction will naturally ascribe to them a Filicineous affinity ; those who
look upon them as an ascending series of increasing complexity, will be disposed to
give them a place in relation to the Lycopodine and Sphenophylleee. The former
view is entertained by many botanists, but without, as far as I am aware, any full
and detailed statement of the grounds for their opinion. Scorr gives to the
comparison a physiological and anatomical basis; he says, ‘‘ Personally, I should
incline to regard them rather as a specialised family, modified in consequence of
