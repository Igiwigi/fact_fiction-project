the upper half plane under the action of SL2(Z).

Figure 1 on the following page depicts the Ford circles centred around fractions in [0,1] with
denominator at most N = 4. For each N, Rademacher’s path is to traverse the arcs of these circles,
starting at i, moving along each arc until the next included Ford circle is intersected, until finally
arriving at i+ 1. In the image for N = 4, the path travels along the solid circular arcs. Rademacher
then expressed the Cauchy integral as a sum over each of these paths, and, under a suitable
change of variables, then used the modular properties of the eta function to expand the values
of P(q) on each of these arcs. These expansions of P(q) can then naturally be split up into a main
term and an error term, the main features being that the main terms become integrals which can
be evaluated exactly as Bessel functions, and the error terms can be explicitly bounded.

After the work of Rademacher, it became apparent that Rademacher’s series were in fact
Poincaré series in disguise. In particular, there are special functions which, when averaged
under the slash operator over the modular group, have Fourier expansions which give the same
expansions. As such Poincaré series are always a basis of the space of all weakly holomorphic
modular forms up to cusp forms (as one can explicitly match them to any principal part and
constant term which always determines a modular form up to a cusp form). For forms of negative
weight such as 1/n(r) this procedure always yields an exact formula. More details on the method
of Poincaré series and how it can be applied to general weakly holomorphic and mock modular
forms can be found in [5].

3. Hodge numbers for Hilbert schemes of surfaces

We now apply the circle method to obtain exact formulae for Hodge numbers for Hilbert schemes.
