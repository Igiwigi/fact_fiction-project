-Sbones, belonging to at least 8izteen individuals. Among these bones were a portion of
Zthe coracoid, examples of the ulna, radius, and fibula, portions of the pelvis and one of
Sthe digital phalanges, all of which had been previously unknown. But, more than this,
Shown a series 80 large it became at once plain, by the presence of many specimens of in-
Stermediate size, that the theory of the existence in the island of Rodriguez of two
Sspecies of Solitaire (originated by Mr. BarTrervr, afterwards adopted with a modification
Sby STRICKLAND, and followed subsequently by one of the present authors in describing
the rexults of the previous © find”) became untenable, and this fact was declared when
Va few months later the specimens arrived in England, and were exhibited at a meeting
=of the Zoological Societyf. 5 Immediately on tidings of this very important discovery being made known in this
Reountry g, the British Assciation for the Advancement of Science, then assembled at
Birmingham, at the instance of Mr. P. T.. ScLarer, appointed a Committee to assist
one of the present authors in his researches into the Didine Birds of the Mascarene
Islands, and placed a handsome 8um of money at his disposal for that purpose.
