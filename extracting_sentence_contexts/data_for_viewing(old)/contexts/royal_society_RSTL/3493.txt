Of these varied combinations, not one gave the least signs of a current, provided
differences of temperature were excluded; though in every case the circle formed
was, as to conducting power, perfect for the purpose, i. e. able to conduct even a very
weak thermo current.

1870. In the contact theory it is not therefore the metals alone that must be as-
sumed to have their contact forces 80 balanced as to produce, in any circle of them,
an effect amounting to nothing (1809.); but all solid bodies that are able to conduct,
whether they be forms of carbon, or oxides, or sulphurets, must be included in the
same category. So also must the electrolytes already referred to, namely, the solu-
tions of sulphuret of potassium and potash, and nitrous and nitric acids, in every
case where they do not act chemically. In fact all conductors that do not act che-
mically in the circuit must be assumed, by the contact theory, to be in this condition,
until a case of voltaic current without chemical action is produced (1858.).

1871. Then, even admitting that the results obtained by Voura and his followers
with the electrometer prove that mere contact has an electromotive force and can
produce an effect, surely all experience with contact alone goes to show that the elec-
tromotive forces in a circuit are always balanced. How else is it likely that the above-
named most varied substances should be found to agree in this respect? unless indeed
it be, as I believe, that all substances agree in this, of having no such power at all.
If s0, then where is the source of power which can account by the theory of contact
for the current in the voltaic pile? If they are not balanced, then where is the suf-
ficient case of contact alone producing a current ? or where are the numerical data
