This hyaline nature of the solenocyte tube I have
never been able to observe in P. newpolitanus, but doubtless it is the same h√©re also,
for, in preserved material, the tubes are the parts of the solenocytes that are best
preserved, and this points to their being composed of some firm substance, for the
protoplasmic heads can seldom be seen in sections or preserved preparations, being
extremely perishable and delicate. Thus, the solenocytes of the Polygordius larva,
with the exception that each does not possess a separate nucleus, are essentially the
same in structure with those of other Annelids. In a recent paper, JANowsky (10)
has examined the nephridia, and has confirmed a number of the above-mentioned
facts concerning their structure. 8. The Structure of the Head-kidney in the Free-swimming Larva.
