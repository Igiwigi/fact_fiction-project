amount supposed, even with the ordinary periodic return, and without such return
gradual exhaustion would be very marked. Indeed, it is well known that there is no-
more exhausting practice than the annual removal of hay without return of manure ;
so that, in point of fact, restoration in anything like the degree supposed certainly
does not take place. Next to the removal of hay, the consumption of grass for the
production of milk is the most, but still very much less, nitrogen-exhausting ; whilst
if the grass be consumed by store or fattening animals, the loss is very much less still ;
indeed it is very small. Obviously, however, it is more important to consider, what is the probable average
loss of nitrogen over a given area by the removal of crops generally, and not by that
of grass alone.
