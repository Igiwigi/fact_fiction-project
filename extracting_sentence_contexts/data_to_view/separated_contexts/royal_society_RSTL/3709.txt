It will be seen to be precisely such as that of the filament
formed within the corpuscle of the blood. We know that discoid corpuscles circulate
in plants ; and it remains to be seen whether filaments are not formed in these. The foregoing facts, I think, indicate the necessity in physiological research, of not
resting satisfied with mere opinion, though emanating from 80 high an authority as
HunTeR; who supposed the corpuscles to be © the least important portion of the
blood.”

Structure of the Flat Filament (© Fibre”) more particularly investigated.

13. We have hitherto viewed the object called by me a flat filament, only in some
of its minutest forms. These are sufficient to show that it is a compound structure.
