In addition, equation (3.11) represents the second
Kirchhoff’s law, where a disjunctive, big-M-based model [74] is used for new lines, ¥ being
a sufficiently large positive constant. For existing network infrastructure, we can assume that
Hin = Mery =1 in all equations. Similarly, for those lines where there are no candidate FACTS


devices (i.e.1 ¢ £2), we assume ue 0 and, therefore, fe 0:

Generating units are also constrained by both their available power capacity (driven by the z

Finally, all decision variables are continuous and non-negative, except for (i) power transfers,
voltage angles and net outputs of storage plants, which may be negative, and (ii) investment
variables associated with new network infrastructure, which are binary, indicating whether a
candidate asset has been chosen for investment (binary variable equal to 1) or not (binary variable
equal to 0). Note that further details can be included in a straightforward manner in the operational
model by adding more variables, constraints and cost functions related to units’ minimum stable
generations, start-up and shut-down costs, minimum up and down times, etc. (see, for instance,
[65,67,68,75]), albeit the current level of detail (equations (3.1)-(3.17)) suffices to illustrate the
importance of operational constraints (through ramp rate and time-coupling constraints, besides
power flow and capacity constraints) when planning future infrastructure.
