Only three
out of 26 patients in this group were classified as acalculic,
and their performance was not described in detail. To summarize thus far: although acalculia following a
right hemisphere lesion was consistently found in clinical
group studies, it was very seldom reported in detail. The var-
ious proportions reported possibly reflected the sensitivity of
different calculation tests employed across studies, and the
fact that some works excluded patients affected by neglect
(see a more detailed review of this issue in the next section). Moreover some studies considered only retro-Rolandic
patients, which further complicated the exact quantification
of the phenomenon. A recent study of Benavides-Varela et al. [21] further
examined this issue by testing 30 right hemisphere patients
on a comprehensive battery of numerical abilities (numerical
activities of daily living, NADL, [22]), and a variety of neu-
ropsychological tests.
