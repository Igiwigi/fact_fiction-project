29. Hence Fresnet’s hypothesis as to the behaviour of ether inside matte
equivalent to the assumption that a potential-function, [y*v cos 6 ds, exists througho
all transparent space, so far as motion of ether alone is concerned.
Given that condition, no first-order interference effect due to drift can be obta n
from stationary matter by sending rays round any kind of closed contour, nor ¢
the path of a ray be altered by ethereal drift through any stationary matter.
As soon as matter is locally moved, however, its motion may readily produce
effect, for it has no potential conditions to satisfy ; it may easily be moved in a clo
contour. Suppose it moves with velocity u, always with the light, the relative dri
of ether thereby caused in it must, as above, be u/n*, and so it may be said to virtua
carry the ether inside it forward with velocity u — u/y? ; for that is the amount t
which it affects the time of journey of a ray. This does not mean that it carr’
with it any ether of space; in fact, it definitely means that it does not appreciab
disturb the ether of space (ef. § 3, b). :
The equation to a ray in moving matter, subject to an independent ether drift, is

ds
lr cose + v/u2 cos + u[1 — (1/u)] cosh ener

30. It is noteworthy that almost all the observations which have been made ¥
negative results as to the effect of the Earth’s orbital motion on the ether are equi
consistent with complete connexion and complete independence between ether
