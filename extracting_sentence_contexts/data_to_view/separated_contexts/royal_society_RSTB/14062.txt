There are several ways this might lead to differences
between plant and animal sex chromosome systems. Land plant sex chromosomes are generally homomorphic
[1,3], although with notable exceptions in Cannabis [15],
Rumex [16] Silene [17] and Coccinia [18,19]. Several have
hypothesized that the low level of divergence between
plant sex chromosomes, in general, is a result of the fact
that dioecy is derived and, therefore, phylogenetically rela-
tively young in land plants [20,21]. The prevalence of
homomorphic plant sex chromosomes is in sharp contrast
to the highly conserved and diverged sex chromosomes in
some animal groups, such as therian mammals, birds and
Lepidoptera [22,23]; but is heteromorphy really the rule in
animals? One could argue that these clades represent the

Divergence of X and Y gene content can also bring with it exception in metazoans, as the vast majority of animals
differences in gene dose between males (with one X chromo- either determine sex without sex chromosomes [1] or with
some) and females (with two X chromosomes).
