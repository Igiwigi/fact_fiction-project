This portion of the vertebral body arises
in Larus and Struthio as a differentiation of that region of the perichordal tube which
comes to lie between the incipient vertebral ring and the primary intervertebral body. It is composed of voluminous cells arranged tangentially with regard to the notochord
and forms the hinder end of the primary vertebral body, as the prospondylous ring
furnishes the cranial end. The fact that Froriep insists on the development of the
vertebral body from an unpaired ventral cluster of cells may be explained by the observa-
tion made by the present writer in Larus and Struthio, that the ventral wall of the opis-
thospondylous zone at its first origin is somewhat thicker than the corresponding wall
of the prospondylous zone. The pro- and opistho-spondylous zones have no phylogenetic significance. They
represent adaptive structures formed in order to meet the mechanical requirements
existing between successive vertebrae.
