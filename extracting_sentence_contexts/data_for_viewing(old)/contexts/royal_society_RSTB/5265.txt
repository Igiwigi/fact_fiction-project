surprise to find that in the later stages of growth the proximal (oldest) parts of false stems
like those of Tempskya and C. australis consisted chiefly or even entirely of decayed
stems and petioles riddled with intruded roots. Of about 24 stems figured by Prof.
Sewarpf in a section of 7. Knowltoni taken about 8 inches from the basal end, only
one had its tissues intact and was free from invading roots. On the other hand, in
the specimen described as 7’. rossica by Kipsron and GwynnE-VauGuan,§ which no
doubt represents a more distal part of the trunk, the stems are all intact and there is
no trace of intrusions.

As Prof. Sewarp suggests (loc. cit., pp. 498, 504), the two species may well be identical,
T. rossica representing the erect distal part of a false stem, which at its base (7'. Knowltoni)
was obliquely ascending and for the most part subterranean. Even apart from the
question of specific identity the facts do not seem to conflict with the view that as
the “ false stem ” grew in height the older parts gradually decayed from below upwards
and became invaded by roots, eventually forming a sort of pedestal of ruins upon
which the younger parts of the plant were raised.

Whether the false stem of Tempskya was erect from the first, as shown in the restora-
tion drawn by Kipsron and Gwynne-VaucHan and subsequently published by
