Dr. Horxtyson called our
attention to the fact that he had observed that while slight mechanical shaking did
not affect the E.M.F. of a yood cell it produced considerable change in the E.M.F. of
one which was too low. This fact we have repeatedly verified. Thus, on August 12, Nos. 41, 45, 46, and 47 were all to low. Their E.M.F. in
each case rose considerably when the cell was tapped, but fell back towards the old
value when the tapping ceased.
