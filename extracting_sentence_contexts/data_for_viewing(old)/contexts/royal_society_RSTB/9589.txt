example, could be seen as proxies for data such as abundances
of species or the composition of species within ecosystems,
which rely on field surveys and are therefore more difficult
and expensive to collect; but both the amount and configur-
ation of remaining native vegetation can be unreliable
predictors of biodiversity variables of ultimate interest [62,63].

As outcomes lacking explicit counterfactuals (figure 2),
measures of the state of biodiversity could be misleading
about impact. Improving or maintaining species status
within protected areas could be taken to indicate success of
protection, even if the same trends are occurring in unprotec-
ted areas and impact is, in fact, zero. Similarly, a protected
area suffering declines in numbers of some species could be
viewed as a failure, even if trends in numbers under protec-
tion are dramatically better than more serious negative trends
without protection.

Conservation resources can also be misdirected if counter-
factual biodiversity outcomes are not correctly defined. This
risk is illustrated by a measure of conservation progress
proposed in Australia [64]. The measure compares the
amount of additional protection, say of an ecosystem, with
the amount of loss of that ecosystem over a defined period,
but the measure can be unrelated to impact. The measure
