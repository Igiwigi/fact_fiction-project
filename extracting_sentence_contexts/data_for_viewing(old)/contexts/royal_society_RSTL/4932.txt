188 MR. NEWPORT ON THE IMPREGNATION OF

egg in a direction transverse to the first cleavage, may also be advanced as conform-
able to the same view. It is further supported by the fact which I have seen in the
egg both of the Frog and Newts, that before the second or crucial cleavage is com-
menced the yelk becomes contracted, s0 that the first cleft for a time is almost imper-
ceptible while it is extended in the transverse direction, or line of axis of the first
division, after which the 8econd or crucial cleft is commenced. To this I may add
another fact which appears to be equally significant, and which occurs in the unim-
pregnated eggs both of the Frog and Newts, but more especially in the latter.
Although no recedence of the yelk from the vitelline membrane takes place in the
unimpregnated egg of the Frog, it becomes, nevertheless, slightly oval after the first
few hours, but returns to its original shape some time afterwards. But the unim-
pregnated egg* of the Newts is not only separated from the vitelline membrane, but
also is depressed, and has a distinct pit in the centre of its upper surface, and also
assumes an obtuse oval form, both which it retains, when the egg is preserved in
water, until decomposition has commenced.

Changes in the impregnated and unimpregnated Ovum compared. â€”Having traced
the egg impregnated by natural union of the sexes through its first period of deve-
lopment, I was able to compare the phases it exhibits with those of the artificially
