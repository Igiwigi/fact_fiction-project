At the close of the
spinnings the direct measurement was repeated, when there appeared a slight dis-
crepancy between the results obtained by Mrs. Srpawick and myself. Tt is in fact
rather a difficult matter to say exactly when the pointer has advanced to the equilibrium
position of the centre of a 8uspended mirror, which cannot be prevented from swinging. Although the amount in question was not important, I thonght it might be more
satisfactory to check the result by another method, and therefore arranged a travelling
mieroscope focussed alternately upon the centre of the mirror and upon a seratch on
the window of the magnet box, by which the distance between these two points was
determined. The remaining distance between the scratch and the scale was easily
measured with the rod.
