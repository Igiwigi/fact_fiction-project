vigorously denounced in 2011 in a paper authored by an Some authors argue that genome reduction is, in fact, a
astonishingly broad collection of the fieldâ€™s luminaries, who more likely or common evolutionary outcome than genome

themselves otherwise hold warring views about eukaryogenesis growth. Indeed, Wolf and Koonin recently proposed:


a general model composed of two distinct evolutionary phases:

the short, explosive, innovation phase that leads to an abrupt

increase in genome complexity, followed by a much longer
reductive phase, which encompasses either a neutral ratchet of
genetic material loss or adaptive genome streamlining

expansions in typical effective populations sizes, as many
believe characterize prokaryotes vis-d-vis eukaryotes, selec-
tion for streamlining might well have independently
effected convergence to simpler cellular organization.
