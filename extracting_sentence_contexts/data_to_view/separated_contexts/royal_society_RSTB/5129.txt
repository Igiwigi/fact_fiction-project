The converse is also true, namely, that the frequency gradient tends to disappear
when plants are grown in a moist atmosphere. his is shown by the data given below,
and has been found to obtain in nearly all the plants examined (cf. also figs. 8 and 12). Mercurialis grown in a humid atmosphere.

It would appear then from, the observed facts that the frequency gradient associated
with increasing height above the ground is correlated with the greater degree of exposure
to which the leaf is subject the higher the level at which it is borne. It is in conformity
with this view that the leaves of Ficaria growing in moist air, but all at about the same
level, showed no correlation with leaf size, whilst those of Statice binervosa growing in dry
conditions showed marked correlation. More significant is the absence of any marked
gradient of frequency in the successive leaves of prostrate shoots growing in moist air
