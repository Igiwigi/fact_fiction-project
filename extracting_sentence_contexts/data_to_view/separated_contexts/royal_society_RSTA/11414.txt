The only method hitherto used by meteorologists to express briefly the variability
of the atmospheric pressure is, so far as we are aware, the statement of the maximum
and minimum heights reached during any given period. The fallacy of this method
has been illustrated by one of us elsewhere.* It gives no real impression whatever
of the manner in which the bulk of the variation is distributed, yet, for most
climatological purposes, this is precisely what we require. Judged by such a test as
this (namely, the range from maximum to minimum height observed) Hillington has
a more variable climate than Scarborough, and Southampton than Babbacombe, but,
as a matter of fact, Hillington is considerably less variable than Scarborough, and Â°
Southampton is slightly less variable than Babbacombe. Another striking illustration of the defects of this method of measuring the
variability has been mentioned to us by Mr. R.
