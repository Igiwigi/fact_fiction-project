that nothing was published about it. The blame was put at Challis and Airy for not giving ‘the
young and retired man the kind of help or advice that he should have received’ [2, p xxvi]. Writing
a few years after Airy’s death, Glaisher explicitly puts the blame on the Astronomer Royal for
not making sure that Adams’ work was published.
