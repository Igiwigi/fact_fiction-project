Confining ourselves, for brevity, to the illustration afforded by a single element, viz. the
Declination, it was found that at all stations, in all parts of the globe, the disturbances
of the declination resolved themselves into two distinct and dissimilar categories ; the same
two distinct and dissimilar forms of diurnal progression being everywhere reproduced
with little other variation than that of the particular hours of maxima and minima ; but
having this additional important peculiarity, that the particular form of the curve of
the diurnal progression which characterized the Easterly Deflection at certain stations
marked the Westerly Deflection at certain other stations, and vice vers. It was also
found that at some stations the Easterly Deflections greatly preponderated over the
Westerly, whilst at other stations the Westerly were predominant. An attentive con-
8ideration of the facts elicited by this extensive though somewhat laborious investiga-
tion strengthened the previously prevailing impression, that the progressive increase of
our knowledge of these remarkable phenomena would lead, in both hemispheres, to
the establishment of a connexion—if not to the identification—of the terrestrial sources
of the casual and transitory disturbances with the foci, as they are sometimes called, of
the two magnetic systems of the globe.

. Proceeding from these premises, it appeared desirable to examine whether, if two

stations were taken in a sitable and nearly similar latitude, one of which might be on

the eastern and the other on the western side of one of the supposed points of terrestrial

origin, and if a sufficient comparison were made of the disturbances simultaneously

.observed at the two tations, the category of easterly deflections at the one station might

not be found to correspond in the form of the curve, and possibly also in the hours of

maxima and minima taken in absolute time, with the category of westerly disturbances
at the other station. To test this by experiment, it was desirable to elect tations, in
suitable localities, where trustworthy observations could be relied on, inasmuch as the
experiment would be somewhat of a crucial nature. 'The Russian stations on the eastern
$ide of Siberia and at Pekin, where hourly observations of the declination had been
made for some years, seemed the most favourably sitnated for supplying a station on
the eastern side of the Europeo-Asiatic focus, whilst Kew might furnish a correspond-
ing tation on the western side, as 800n as its photographic records should be sufficiently
advanced.
