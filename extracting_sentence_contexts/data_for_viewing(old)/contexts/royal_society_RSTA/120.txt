fluid—fluid interface with a single layer of particles. The evaporation rate is enforced by applying : =
an evaporative boundary condition on the top plane with pevap = 0. The total number of particles D8
corresponding to ®p is N= 192. airel

In figure 7a, we show the time evolution of the interface height for different particle packing 1

fractions and compare the results to the evaporation of a fluid without particles. As expected, the [Ss
evaporation rate reduces for an increasing number of particles present in the system. We observe [Ss
a small deviation from an otherwise smoothly decreasing interface height, which is larger and 1 xe
occurs earlier for increasing packing fractions. For a particle fraction of 6 = 24, this deviation
appears around ¢ =2.5 x 10*At, whereas for & =39y it already appears around t= 1.5 x 10*At.
This change in the evaporation rate could be related to the deformation of the particles. In fact, in
figure 7b, one can observe the time evolution of the instantaneous volume of the particles. In the
initial state, all particles have the same volume of Vo. When a particle adsorbs at the fluid—fluid
interface, the surface tension exerts a tensile force on the particle boundary, and thereby reduces
its volume. As a result of the elastic properties of its surface, the particle then decompresses trying
to expand back towards its initial volume Vo. The minimum in the particle volume occurs around
the same time as the deviation observed in the evolution of the interface height, suggesting
that the temporarily decreased evaporation rate results from decompressing particles. This effect
occurs earlier in the simulation and is stronger for larger packing fractions because more particles
are initialized close to the interface.

The influence of this compression and decompression on the position of the interface can be
understood as follows: when a particle centred at the interface decompresses, i.e. its volume
