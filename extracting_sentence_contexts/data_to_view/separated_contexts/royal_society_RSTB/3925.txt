miliaris can mature and produce ripe germ
cells within the first year of its existence. In the laboratory we have been
successful also in getting our H. miliaris, raised from the egg, to produce ripe egg
cells when they were barely twelve months old. This has established the fact that
our laboratory conditions, after all, are not so unfavourable for this species, judging
from the fact that the urchins raised in captivity produced germ cells in about the
same time as those growing at large in the sea. It is remarkable that all three species of Echinus that we have used in this work
can become sexually mature when relatively small and much below their normal full
size. We have obtained ripe eggs from urchins of HE. miliaris when these have
measured less than one centimetre across the spines.
