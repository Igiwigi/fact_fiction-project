A system where combining symbols also results in combining their
meanings, again in systematic ways, is compositional: given a phrase or sentence,
itis very often possible to assign to it a meaning that is a function of the meanings
of the parts (e.g. the constituent words) and of the structure of the whole
expression [1,2]. Meaning composition is remarkable among human mental
capacities and behaviours, because it does not appear to be adequately accounted
for by statistical relationships or by associative processing alone [3-6]. This fact
stands in striking contrast with the behaviour of other perception-action and
cognitive systems which can be well predicted by traditional or contemporary
statistical or associative models. A further vexing conundrum lies in explaining
how systems in the brain realize meaning composition within the bounds of
neurophysiological computation, given that the human brain is a computational
device whose primary remit is to learn from and capitalize upon the statistical
structure of its environment. THE ROYAL SOCIETY
