carapace and the back, the animal leaves off swimming, sinks slowly to the bottom, rests
there for a few seconds, and then giving a sudden spring forwards, leaves behind it the
inner case, with the rest of the moulted skin.

'This experiment renders evident, I think, the true nature of the inner case of the
ephippium, which is in fact the inner layer of the carapace, modified in the same manner
as the outer. If a thin section of the carapace be made, it will be found to consist of
two folds, containing probably between them another, most likely double membrane, the
corium.

According to analogy, we may safely conclude that the corium forms round itself the
new carapace, which therefore arises between the two layers of the old carapace. More-
over, it is only when fully developed that the lower and side margins of the © inner
case ” are free; before maturity they may easily be found to be continuous with a very
delicate membrane, the inner layer of the carapace.

The diagram (Plate VII. fig. 4) will serve to make this explanation clearer. The lines
marked w represent the outer and inner layer of the old carapace, in the thickness of
