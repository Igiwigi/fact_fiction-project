We subtracted this value to that obtained with our
simulations and we show the comparison of our corrected results against those of Ellis et al.: the
experimental data on figure 10, and the computational data on figure 11. When comparing with
their experiments, after the correction was applied, we observe a good match of the wavenumber
for the lower (and stronger) mode, as well as a good match for the third and fourth peaks. The
wavenumber of the second peak, related to a longitudinal excitation (mode Log9 in Ellis et al.),
presents a discrepancy that we believe is related to the fact that our pillar does not have a substrate
underneath. The remaining (fifth) peak also presents a discrepancy, but in this case, we cannot
identify the reason. We did not analyse the peaks out of the range 864-961 cmâ„¢, since Ellis ef al.
describe these peaks to be associated with zone-folded LO (longitudinal) phonons of 4H-SiC,
and outside the scope of their study.
