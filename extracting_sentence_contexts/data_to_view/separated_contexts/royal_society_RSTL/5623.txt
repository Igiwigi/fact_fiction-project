I had already found in the distorted fossils of West Water-
ford conclusive arguments in favour of the view put forward by Mr. SHARPE, that the
planes of cleavage were perpendicular to the line of maximum force ; and before con-

xcluding that the platy or flaggy structure of the conglomerate was true cleavage, I was
Shound to show that its planes were perpendicular to the lines of greatest force. In the
[Mcence of fossils this could not be proved in the usual manner ; but the following facts. Sascertained by me, leave little doubt upon this important point. Soon after I had first observed the flaggy structure of the cleavage planes of the con-
Oglomerate, I found that this structure was confined to planes having the general direc-
Stion of the system (A), already noticed in speaking of faults, although it was occa-
Sionally observed in planes parallel to the system (A').
