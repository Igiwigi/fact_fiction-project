Comparisons between the teeth of man and the apes, and between the teeth of extant
and fossil apes, have to take account of all these kinds of differences. Many are essentially
a measure of the relative degree of development of the same basic characters, and almost
all are amenable to statistical analysis. In spite of this obvious fact, the quantitative
aspects of comparative odontology have been little emphasized in recent years. Very few
figures have ever been published about dimensions of the teeth of extant species of ape,
and such as are available have neither been treated by the methods of modern statistics,
nor have they as a rule been presented in a way which allows of statistical analysis by other
