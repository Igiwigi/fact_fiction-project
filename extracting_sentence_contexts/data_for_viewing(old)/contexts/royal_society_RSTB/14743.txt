In reality, the retinal image is the product of Perspective
Projection, which is why we see the world in perspective.
On this account, visual direction is angular (figure 17a). By
contrast, the retinal image could have been produced by
Orthographic Projection (using a telecentric lens), where the
world is not subject to the laws of perspective. In which
case, visual direction is parallel (figure 17b). So how we
map from our visual experience (the visual field) to visual

Depth constancy is the claim that we should see objects as
having the same perceived 3D shape with distance. And

the fact that objects appear to get flatter with distance [98]

is seen as a failure of depth constancy [167].

But again, in angular terms, the perceived z-axis depth of
an object really does fall-off much faster (with distance
squared) than its x-axis and y-axis angular size, so the object
should be perceived as flatter with distance. This point is
easier to grasp if we donâ€™t think about 3D shape, but instead
just think about two points, one on the front and one on the
back of the object. No matter the distance, the disparity on
the retina accurately reflects the angular visual direction of
those two points given the position of the eyes. So, on an angu-
