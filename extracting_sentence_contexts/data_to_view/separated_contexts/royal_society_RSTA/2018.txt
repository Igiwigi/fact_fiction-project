As
a result, the condition s(t) < oo will be satisfied for all moments of time. From the estimate for the
effective radius (radius of influence) of major pores obtained above, it follows that r5 ~ r?/ (2+),
Hence, for small values of @ and small r, the diffusion in the matrix in r direction exhibits a regular
Fickian character. In other situations, accounting for the fact that 2/(2 + 6) <1, the anomalous
non-Fickian diffusion, which is called subdiffusion, takes place. It will be shown further that in
direction perpendicular to r, the following estimate is true: y? ~ c!~4*/@+*), which justifies that in
this direction the mass transport is subdiffusive as well. Having an expression (2.17) for u(r, t) and accounting for Duhamel’s theorem [31], solution
of the boundary value problem (2.13)-(2.16) can be readily presented in the following form:

u(r, t) = 2 I, eply, E)e** ur (r,t — E)dé. (2.18)

Accounting for the formulae (2.12) and (2.18), the mass flux on the wall of the major pore,
which is defined by the derivative of the function cf(r, t) with respect to ras r > 0, can be readily
found as follows:

According to the Riemann-Liouville definition of the fractional derivative [26], correlation

Initial and boundary conditions for equation (2.21) can be written in the following form:

t=0, Cp=0; (2.22)
y=0, cp=c (2.23)
and yr oo, Cp>0. (2.24)

Condition (2.23) means that the concentration of the solute in the points of entrance from the
fracture to the major pores is equal to the concentration in the fracture.
