cages and this would be the percentage of pupae (fertile male
and female) composing the next round. Slightly modified from
Zeng et al. [19], to reduce the rearing time until next generation,
the rearing was anticipated, so by the time the adjusted hatch
rate was determined, the adults would be ready to restock the
respective cages, and in addition, larvae were returned in the con-
trol cages based on their hatching rate and not at a standard rate.
Egg laying and hatching as well as larva and adult handling and
feeding were performed as described above.

(h) Identification of red eyes through image analysis
The identification of red eyes is based on an image acquisition and
analysis system which takes advantage of the fact that melanized
black eyes in the males appear as a black BLOB (Binary Large
Object) under near-infrared light (850nm), while red eyes
cannot be seen due to the lack of melanin. The algorithm performs
a morphological analysis in several steps, such as segmentation of
body, identification of centroid and alignment of the cepha-
lothorax and search of dark BLOBs in the area defined by the
relative positions of the latter. The pictures of the pupae used
for this analysis have been taken using a camera model ‘IDS
UI-3080CP-C-GL Rev 2’ with no IR filter, a ‘RICHO FL-CC2514-
5M’ lens and a source of IR light with a wavelength of 850 nm.
The application that implements the algorithm has been devel-
oped in C++ language, using OpenCV 3.4.2 graphics library and
