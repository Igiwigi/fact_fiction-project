and green disks, the red fixation point was found to be down, and to the left of the green
fixation point; with the red and blue disks, the blue fixation point was found on the right
of that for red; with the blue and green disks, the green fixation point was found to be up,
and to the left of the blue one. Similar tests with the right eye gave results in substantial
agreement with the above, but with less certainty, because the definition of this eye is not
so good as the other.

The conclusion from these experiments is that the fixation points for the different colours
occupy different positions on the retina, as should be the case in accordance with the
cluster hypothesis. The three fixation points appear to lie at the corners of an imaginary
right-angled triangle with the right angle forming the apex. The green fixation point
corresponds to the apex, the red one corresponds to the left-hand end of the base, while the
blue one corresponds to its right-hand end. Leaving out of account the fact that the green
fixation point lies above the other two, the order of the points, travelling in a horizontal
line in a nasal direction are: red, green and blue, in the case of the left eye. In the case of
the right eye they are in the reverse order, namely, blue, green and red. This reversal
makes it impossible for the order in both eyes to be due either to the decentred lens which
was used in these experiments, or to uncorrected chromatic difference of magnification.
In order to confirm this conclusion, so far as the lens was concerned, a few tests were done
without any lens. The order of the fixation points was still found to be the same, although
their displacements relative to one another were different, and the experimental results
less clear.

The relative position of the fixation points described above was investigated, using the
micro-stimulation apparatus, an account of which will be found in Part X. Use was made
