8 arrays. The five functions (ab), [ab], [abe], (abe), and (abed) are particular cases of
3 arrays, being, in fact, arrays of one row. In general the array of m rows and 2

g may be defined as a function of mn quaternion constituents, which vanishes if, and
A only if, the groups of the constituents composing the rows were connected by linear

relations with the same set of scalar multipliers. In other words, the array vanishes
if scalars ¢,, t,... ¢, can be found to satisfy the m equations
