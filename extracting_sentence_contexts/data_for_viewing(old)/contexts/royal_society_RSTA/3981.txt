overlap regions, are located at the same positions x. In order for the LBM to accurately simulate
such flow, it is fundamental to implement proper wall boundary conditions, namely diffuse
reflection of populations impinging into the walls [34], and the regularization procedure [35,36],
which, projecting the non-equilibrium discrete distributions onto the same Hermite polynomial
basis as used to project the equilibrium populations, allows one to get rid of the moments not
sufficiently supported by the lattice. Based on the test conditions here investigated, five fine level
time integration steps for the DSMC are performed between two consecutive coarse level time
integration steps for the LBM.

Taking into account the characteristics of the tested flow, a few additional considerations about
the flux exchanges at the DSMC-LBM interface as prescribed by equation (2.5) are due. One
disadvantage of imposing the fluxes across the coupling interface, instead of the related densities,
resides in the fact that fluxes show larger statistical noise [37]. As a means to increase the signal-
to-noise ratio of the fluxes exchanged at the DSMC-LBM interface, besides using the cumulative
averages over time, justified by the steady-state nature of the investigated flow, we choose to
evaluate them by averaging over the cell volumes, instead of measuring across the interface
surface, see [12,38]. Moreover, it has to be noted that, for the tested case, there is no net mass flux
across the interface. Nonetheless, we also impose and test the mass flux conservation constraint
across the DSMC-LBM interface. We also avoid having to implement fitting of the mean moment
profiles to damp out fluctuations faster, as done in [3,4], because such practice cannot be easily
extended to complex flows.
