In particular, we approximate ¢(s + a)
by a Dirichlet polynomial >*,,-y 1~°~* with X substantially larger than T, say X = T° with 1 <0 <
2; the error in such an approximation is < X'/?/T when t~T so that ¢(s) is well approximated
pointwise by this long Dirichlet polynomial. We introduce a smooth weight function w(u) which is
real and compactly supported, say on [1,2], and then evaluate the mean square of ¢ by evaluating

(as in [8])
v(x) (a+)

Using coefficient correlations, Goldston and Gonek prove that this is

[v] is the floor of v, i.e. the greatest integer less than or equal to v, and the Fourier transform is
defined by

W(v) = I. w(ue(uv) du,

as y > 07. In the present formulation, this is purely a statement about a relationship between a
function and its Fourier transform for real, compactly supported functions yw. We note that establishing the compatibility between the result of Goldston & Gonek [8] and
that in [3,4] in the approach taken here relies on proving equation (2.1).
