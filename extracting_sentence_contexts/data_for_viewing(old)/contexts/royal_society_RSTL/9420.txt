actual contacb with the glass, the column is severed ; and in the latter cage, in
addition to the Iuminosity previously present, there often appears proceeding from the
interior of the tube, ab the point where the finger rests, the blue haze which usually
characterises the negative end of a discharge. In some cages the discharge is 80
powerfully affected that the well-known green or blue fluorescence appears on the side
of the tube opposite to the point touched.

The degree of sensitiveness varies between wide limits. Discharges frequently
occur in which close obseryation is necessary to detect any trace of it, while others
may be produced s0 sensitive that the magnetic action of a powerful electro-magnet is
hardly more marked than the action which is due to it as a conductor. The condition
in question does not appear to be confined to any particular gaseous medinm or to any
special form of tube ; and it is in fact probable that in almost any tube sensitiveness
may be produced by adopting suitable precautions.* This state of sensitiveness may
be exhibited by stratified discharges, but it is more commonly as8ociated with those
which show no clear traces of stratification. Tt is not however universally present in
either kind of discharge.

The state in which the discharge is affected by the presence or approach of a conductor
will be called the 8ensitive state ; while that in which it is not 80 affected will be called
the non-8ensitive state. The former is the subject of the present, inquiry.

The attention of the authors of this paper was drawn to this form of vacuum dis-
charge, partly by the striking character of the phenomena which it presents and partly
by their own earlier observations which led them to connect it with an interruptedness
