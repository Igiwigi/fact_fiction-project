It does not immediately assume the length
due to the state of hygrometry, but if heated the set is taken out, and the wood expands
to its proper length.

77. Tnasmuch as at a certain degree of humidity wood contracts in every direction
with a rise of temperature, it might be inferred that on weighing it in water its specific
gravity would be found to increase on the elevation of temperature. Such, however, is
not the fact. A piece of saturated wood, being part of the specimen employed in the
last series of experiments, was found to weigh 392-6 grs. in air, 42-26 grs. in distilled
water at 0?, and 42:01 grs. in distilled water at 8*. Hence the cubical expansion was
0000892 per degree, but calculated on the wood considered apart from the water in its

Pores, -000396.
