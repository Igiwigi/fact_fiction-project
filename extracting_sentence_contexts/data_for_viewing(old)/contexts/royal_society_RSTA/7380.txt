Now, | E(x) |? represents the distribution of illumination over the diffracting screen, averaged
over systems; in the case we have previously considered, where the screen was delimited

by a stop, | E(x) |? is uniform inside the stop and zero outside, in other cases | E(x) |? might

be a function representing the fact that all systems were illuminated by a non-uniform beam
of parallel light. Equation (20) then tells us that the average auto-correlation function p,(c) within
the angular spectrum is proportional to the Fourier transform of the average distribution | E(x) \* over the
diffracting screens.

But the Fourier transform of | E(x) |? also represents the angular spectrum produced by
a distribution of field which has this same form, and we therefore deduce that the auto-
correlation function within the angular spectrum has the same form as the angular spectrum
which would be produced by the distribution of illumination given by | E(x) |*. This state-
ment clearly agrees with: the result of our previous physical argument applied to the case of
a simple ‘stop’.
