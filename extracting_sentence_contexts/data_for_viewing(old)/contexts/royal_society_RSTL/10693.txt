53, If the body be moving under the action of no forces, there are two invariable
complexes, Viz. :

9f+99 +9) +qga+qgb+qc=0

and its conjugate complex. For since the equations of motion express the fact that
the g's do not change, these complexes will be fixed in space. The complex whose
equation has just been given is the locus of lines along which there is no linear
momentum. If no forces act, if we multiply the equations of motion respectively by
@1, ®g, . . . wg, and add, we geb by integration

Aw*+Bouy?+Coug?+Fof+Go?+Huf=2T

which is the equation of conservation of energy.
If again we multiply the equations of motion by Aw;, Bus, - . . , and add, we arrive
at another integral of the equations,

A%o;*+ B*og+O%,+ Foul+ 0%, +H%uf=K?,
