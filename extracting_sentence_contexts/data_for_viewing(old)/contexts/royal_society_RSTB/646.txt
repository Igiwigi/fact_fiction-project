Part III, Direct Observation (after Dissection) of Muscles thrown tnto Action by
Excitation of the Separate Nerve Roots.

I next attempted to ascertain, as far as possible, which muscles are thrown into
action by stimulation of the several nerve roots. The superficial muscles were
exposed by removal of the skin and examined, while, with regard to the deep
muscles, I frequently was able to examine them directly after the animal was killed,
because the nerve roots at the end of a prolonged experiment retained. their excita-
bility for a considerable time, half-an-hour or more.

On account of the fact that no result among the muscles of the fore-limb followed
excitation of the fifth cervical root, attention was only paid to the three lower cervical
and the two upper dorsal roots with the following results :—

Siath Cervical Root—

Brachio-mastoid. Subscapularis.
Diaphragm. Coraco-brachialis.
Deltoid. Biceps.
Supraspinatus. Brachialis anticus.
Infraspinatus.

Seventh Cervical Root—
