In the main, the question is no longer difficult to answer. In the case of the
American eel, the pelagic larval stage is terminated in about one year; consequently
the larvae have not time to make the journey to Europe, the distance being more than
they can cover in that period. It is otherwise with the European eel, which takes
nearly three times as long over its larval development, as a result of which practically
all of them are far away from the western (American) portion of the Atlantic when
the time comes for them, as elvers, to seek the coasts.

We can thus indicate both a geographical and an ethological cause for the distribu-
tion of the two species of fresh-water eels. The former lies in the fact that Anguilla
rostrata has its centre of production somewhat farther west and south than Anguilla
vulgaris. The latter is the different duration of the pelagic migratory stage. These
two facts, in conjunction with the ocean currents as an aid to transport, and later—
once the earliest stages of development are past—the active movements of the larvee
themselves, must be regarded as the causes which lead the two Atlantic species of

eels to find each its own side of the ocean, despite the close proximity of their
breeding-grounds.

That fish should undertake migrations of considerable extent while in the pelagic
larval stage is nothing unusual. I need only call to mind the young of the Gadoids,
and their migrations round Iceland, which I had an opportunity of studying in
