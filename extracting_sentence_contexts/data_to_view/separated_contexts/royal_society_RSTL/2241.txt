Let a delicate
air thermometer be placed opposite the disc of glass on one
side of the plate, and a heated iron ball opposite to the bulb
on the other. Let a current of cold air be made to play

formly below the temperature of the ambient air. Things
being thus arranged, the following facts will be observed. * 15t. When the temperature of the ball is low, no sensible
effect is produced on the thermometer. 2nd.
