fuestions relating to the working of the several parts of nerve centres.

&Most prominently stand out two principal facts :—

PU) The kinetogenetic portion* of a spinal nerve centre is probably the afferent
= side. (See Section 2.)

E(2.) The part in which the delay and diminution of impulses passing through is

ESI effected is the efferent side of such a centre with the field of conjunction.
3 (See Section 2.)

= The consideration of these facts, unexpected as they were, shows clearly that the
iiterprotation by Bastrant of sensori-motor nerve phenomena is probably the most
Srrect yet advanced. The basis of that interpretation, namely, the doctrine of
Kinesthesis as formulated by: him, is in complete harmony with our experimental
results.

Bastian has for many years contended that the ordinary division of nerve centres
or parts of the same into sensory and motor respectively is misleading, and that not
only has the statement that the source of a nerve centre’s discharge is the motor part

* By the term “kinetogenetic portion” we have styled that part of a centre in which the potential
energy is converted into kinetic.
