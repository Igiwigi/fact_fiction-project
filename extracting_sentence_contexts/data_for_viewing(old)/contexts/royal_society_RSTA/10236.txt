meridians the direction of gravity will be found to follow one general law; in the
neighbourhood of the tropic, as we move northwards, its direction will change from
northerly to southerly; it will then remain deflected towards the south for some

hundreds of miles, and it will again become northerly as the Himalayas come into
view.

In spite, therefore, of the fact that the true direction of gravity at any one place
cannot be determined with certainty, yet it is possible now to classify deflections of
the plumb-line in India by regions. A modification of the spheroid of reference may
alter values and may move the regional boundaries, but it will not affect the general
correctness of the classification. A change in the assumed value of the direction of
gravity at the station of origin will alter all deduced deflections of the plumb-line by
the same amount, but it will not affect their differences, nor the mean differences
between regions.

I propose now to show :

(1) The classification of stations by regions.
