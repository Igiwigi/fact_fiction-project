Left, diagram adapted from [12]; right, structural types. While there are small apparent differences between these figures, the overall picture is quite similar. This
observation is owing to the fact that the architectonic type principle implies that structural type differences are correlated with laminar projection patterns, and, thus, the
structural type scheme underlies the hierarchical arrangement of areas resulting from the sorting of the oriented projections. Figure adapted from [69]. Here, we focused on four different uses, and thus, uses and meanings of the term can be discerned from the
meanings of the term ‘hierarchy’ (figure 8).
