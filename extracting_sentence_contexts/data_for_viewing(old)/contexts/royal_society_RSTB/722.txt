gams constitute the ginger-beer plant proper, and are necessary for its formation
and peculiar action, the rest are merely accessory or foreign organisms, doubtless due
to the admixture of spores from outside. Of these there are also two which are so
constantly present, that I was for a long time in doubt as to their true relations: the

remainder only occur occasionally, and are certainly intruders, such as might be
expected to occur in such a heterogeneous mixture, exposed to air and made with
ordinary water, as the usual “ brew” of “home-made ginger-beer” is. In fact, any
fungus or Schizomycete that will grow in a saccharine solution at ordinary tempera-
tures, might occur in the exposed fermentations. I have confined my attention only
to the forms usually met with.

Of the two essential forms, one is a species of Saccharomyces, which turns out to
be a new species, and which I shall have to name ; the uther is a Schizomycete, and is
also a new and very remarkable species, and must be named.

Of the two constant, but not essential forms, found in all the specimens examined,
one is a yeast-like form, which turns out to be Mycoderma cerevisie (DxEsm.), the
well-known agent of the “ mould”* on sour beer, &c.; while the other is the vinegar
Bacterium—Bacterium aceti (Kit1rz.),—equally well known as the principal constituent
