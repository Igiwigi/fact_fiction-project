Hence steady motions can exist
on a rotating globe, but these are necessarily of zonal type. We have in fact 160 MR. S. S. HOUGH ON THE APPLICATION OF HARMONIC

already seen in Part I.* that the only forms of steady motion which can exist are of
this character, and have explained the fact by stating that the steady motions not
of zonal type which can exist on a globe without rotation must have their analogue
in the more general case in oscillatory motions whose period bears a finite ratio to
the rotation-period, no matter how great the latter may be. Our present work
confirms this statement and throws further light on the nature of these oscillatory

motions. ยง 9.
