Owing to the fact that an appreciable amount of distillation takes place at the
higher temperatures, it is impossible to deduce from these observations an accurate
value for the depression constant. of the glass. Fig. 9 is a typical curve of zeros which
shows that very few of the observations are as much as 0-003° C. off the mean curve.
The discontinuity at 20° C. is due to the fact that, for convenience, the curve was plotted
in short sections (Section VI). A smooth curve would represent the facts better, but
any errors introduced only amount to one or two thousandths of a degree in an
individual thermometer. The broken line is the depression curve obtained when
allowance is made for the amount of distillation estimated to have taken place as a
result of observations of zeros after repeated steam points. In this way, taking a
mean of all thermometers, the depression of verre dur is estimated at 0-10,° C. for
