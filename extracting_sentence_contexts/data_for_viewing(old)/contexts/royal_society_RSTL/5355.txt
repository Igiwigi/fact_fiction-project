is applied to a set of eggs, and—as s00n afterwards as the experiment can be made,
a solution of potass,—of snch a strength as is known by previous microscopic observa-
tion to have the property of instantly decomposing the spermatic body,—the solution
being wasbed away quiekly after its application, by repeated quantities of water,—
to prevent. its affecting the egg itself—that then—in some- instances—even when the
interval of time between the application of the spermatic fluid and the subsequent ap-
plication of the potass does not exceed a few seconds,—impregnation of the egg is
effected; as is proved by the formation of the chamber, the segmentation of the
yelk, and perhaps the formation of an embryo. Further, that, all circumstances
being similar, excepting only that the interyal of time between the application of the
a spermatic fluid, and, subsequently, that of the solution of potass be prolonged, —the
Q production of an embryo is not, only more certain to take place, but the number of
5 embryos produced is increased. The now ascertained fact of almost instantaneous
Sz penetration by the spermatozoon, which, as before shown, sometimes arrives at the
£ vitelline membrane in less than one minute after its application to the egg, confirms

made, viz. that impregnation is commenced at the instant the spermatozoon is in con-
5 tact with the egg; while it also seems to afford the true explanation of the nature of

© influence, the effect of which on the egg itself was obviated by speedy dilution and
S ablution with water.
E The potass experiments may thus be regarded as confirming by anticipation the
