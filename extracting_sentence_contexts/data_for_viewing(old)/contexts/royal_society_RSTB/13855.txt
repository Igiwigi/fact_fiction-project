with small size and submissiveness. We present a cross-cultural meta-analysis

of polite speech of 101 speakers from seven different languages. While we find

communicative meanings. Cultural and contextual variation determines which
specific meanings become manifest in a specific interactional context. We use
the evidence from our meta-analysis to propose an updated view of the fre-
