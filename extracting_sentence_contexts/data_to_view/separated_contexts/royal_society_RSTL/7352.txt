The employment therefore of the coefficients themselves as auxiliars, although
theoretically applicable to an equation of any order whatever, can in practice be applied
only to the cases for which a geometrical illustration is in fact unnecessary. 267. I will consider in a different manner the case of the quartic, chiefly as an instance
of the actual employment of a surface in the discussion of the character of an equation;
for in the case of a quintic the auxiliars are in the sequel selected in such manner that
the surface breaks up into a plane and cylinder, and the discussion is in fact almost,
independent of the surface, being conducted by means of the curve (Professor SyLvEsTER's
Bicorn) which is the intersection of the plane and cylinder. Article Nos. 268-273.â€”Application to the Quartic equation.
