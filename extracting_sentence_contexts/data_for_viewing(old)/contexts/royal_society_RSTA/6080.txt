RNA has been studied in depth as a paradigmatic example of the sequence-to-structure map
[51]. It has been shown that the frequency distribution of secondary structures follows a
lognormal distribution [15,16], thus quantifying the bias in phenotype (structure) abundance.
Accordingly, common phenotypes are orders of magnitude more frequent than average-sized or
small phenotypes (which are, by any reasonable measure, invisible to evolution). RNA structure
is tightly related to molecular function and, as such, it may have played a main role at the early
stages of chemical evolution and, especially, in an RNA world predating modern cells [52]. The
repertoire of secondary structures in large populations of short RNA polymers is limited [53]:
topologically simple RNA modules are abundant. In open RNA chains, there is a predominance
of stemâ€”loops (composed of a stem and a hairpin loop) and hairpin structures [54], while closed
RNA chains preferentially fold into rod-like structures (a stem closed by two hairpin loops) [55].
This fact is solely based on thermodynamic principles [56] and implies that, by default, short RNA
sequences will predominantly yield a handful of structures.

The relevant implication of this high redundancy is that some of those abundant structures
might be the end result of random RNA polymerization (as could have been the case in prebiotic
environments [57]). With no previous selection, random polymers might have thus covered
an array of incipient functions. Such is the case with a variety of hairpin-like structures able
to promote ligation reactions [58,59], or of hammerhead structures involved in cleavage [60].
RNA self-ligation might indeed be instrumental in the modular construction of more complex
ribozymes, as theoretically proposed [34] and empirically shown [61,62].

There are reasons to believe that the severe phenotypic bias of the sequence-to-structure RNA
map, as quantified through the lognormal distribution of phenotype sizes, is a general property
