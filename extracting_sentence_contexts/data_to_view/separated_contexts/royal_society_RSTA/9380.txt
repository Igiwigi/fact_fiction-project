The correct values of b are not likely to differ from those we have assumed
by more than 50 per cent., but even a difference as large as this would only affect our
results by 3 percent. We may regard the mean of the two estimates, 360 km. (0-056 R)
as accurate to within about 5 per cent. The fact that this mean value of the depth below the surface is not very different from
the mean estimate of the depth below normal makes it quite certain that normal earth-
quakes must originate within a few tens of kilometres below the surface. The depth of the focus in relation to the magnitudes of the surface and upper crustal
features may be visualised from fig. 6. This is a rough scale drawing of a section of the
upper layers of the earth across the Sea of Japan in the region of the earthquake ; the
depths of the granitic and intermediate layers are assumed to be about the same as the
estimates obtained for continental areas.
