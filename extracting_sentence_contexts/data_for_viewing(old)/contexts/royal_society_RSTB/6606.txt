ambulacrals (fig. 8 A). In Aulechinus and Ectinechinus this was not so. The radial
water vessels were enclosed within the walls of the test in inner ridges of the ambula-
crals. These inner ridges roofed over the radial vessels separating them from the
coelomic cavity (fig. 8 B), that is, the relationship of water vessel to ambulacral was
as in the Asterozoa.

The evidence is quite clear, whether we examine the original moulds, or the rubber
impressions. If we first examine a mould, e.g. that photographed (fig. 2, Pl. 13), we
can see dark spaces along each side of the per-radial mud cast. These spaces represent
the hollows left after the inner ridges of the original test had been dissolved away. If
these inner ridges had enclosed the water tube the hollows should extend right under
the casts and leave these casts suspended in the groove. Examination of the moulds
shows this to be the case. In fact the per-radial casts, representing the main water
vessel, are only kept in position by the lateral supporting casts, shown also in the
photograph, representing the branch vessels to the tube feet.

It is now possible to understand the rubber impressions. If from natural causes
the supports of the per-radial mud casts have disappeared, or if artificially we remove,
by a needle, a portion of a mud cast, we get a rubber impression showing the entire
depth of the internal ridge. The roofing is complete and the sutures extend right to
the top of the ridge (fig. 7A). If, however, we make a rubber impression, taking
care not to press hard and so destroy the mud cast, we obtain at the summit of the
ridge interruptions representing the impressions of the mud casts. The roof is flattened
out and we see median hollows (fig. 7 B, fig 4, pl. 14), representing swellings in the
original radial water system.
