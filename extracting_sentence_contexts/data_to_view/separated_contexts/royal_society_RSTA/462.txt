The conservative backlash ruined Beddoes’s
reputation and eventually drove Priestley into lonely exile in Northumberland, Pennsylvania
[24, pp. 263-401]. Priestley’s broad philosophical vision issued in a powerful set of epistemological principles
and methodological guidelines which regulated his pneumatic inquiries according to a strict
distinction between ‘facts’ and ‘hypotheses’ [23, pp. 399-404; 18, Part 1, pp. 31-36]. The injunction
to police the boundaries between facts and hypotheses is immediately evident in Priestley’s
view of the phlogiston theory as a ‘mere hypothesis’, which like all hypotheses was necessary
for the discovery of ‘new facts’, but bereft of any lasting explanatory worth [28]. Priestley
modelled the version of phlogiston he used in ‘Observations’ on Cavendish’s appeal to the
standard Stahlian notion of a generic ‘principle of inflammability’ (present in all combustible
substances, including metals) to explain the production of inflammable air from dilute metal-
acid solutions [18, Part 1, pp. 43-45, Part II, pp. 104-105]. But Priestley soon loosened phlogiston
from its tradition identification with the principle of inflammability, turning it into a veritable
Proteus of cosmic proportion [18, Part III, pp. 158-164; 29].
