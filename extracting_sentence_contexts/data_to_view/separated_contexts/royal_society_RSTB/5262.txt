Much of the
misleading nature of this map may be ascribed to the limitation imposed on the
surveyor by the inadequate subdivision of the rocks. Of the three old divisions (Lower
Caleareous Grit, Coral Rag and Upper Calcareous Grit), only the two first were considered
to enter into this area, and it is obvious that the surveyor drew the boundary at different
horizons in the Berkshire Oolites at different places. This does not account, however, for the fact that, within the scope of three adjacent
fields on Red Down, Oxford Clay, the whole sequence of the Corallian formation, and an
outlier of Upper Calcareous Grit clay and possibly Kimeridge Clay, 25 ft. thick, are all
mapped as Lower Calcareous Grit.*

* At W(101) on the map a deep boring was sunk in 1904, passing right through Red Down. For
