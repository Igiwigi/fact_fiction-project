the gases during different stages of the cycle.

Lovett, CoLeMAN, and Boyp* fitted a sampling valve to a single-cylinder engine,
and analysed the gases for CO,, CO, O,, H,, paraffins, and unsaturated hydro-
carbons, giving curves for the CO,, CO, O,, and H, percentage at various parts of
the stroke. It was found, however, that the valve was open over too long an interval
to provide results from which reliable information could be obtained. Wrirnrow,
Lovett, and Boyp} designed another valve, which opened over a much smaller
crank angle (2°to 4°). They only gave curves for oxygen consumption, the samples
were taken from various points, a number of cylinder heads being available with the
valve socket arranged in different positions. They showed that oxygen commenced
to disappear 2° from t.d.c., and steep curves were obtained only in the region where
“knock” occurred. In fact, for a given mixture strength and engine speed the rate
of combustion was only found to be affected to any considerable extent by detonating
conditions in the last part of the charge to burn.

(a)—Fuels Used in Experiments and Range of the Engine Conditions Investigated

Three characteristic engine fuels have been investigated, namely Shell No. 1
petrol, winter grade ; a mixture of Shell No. 1 and 8-0 cc of ethyl fluid per gallon
(i.e. 4:4 cc lead tetra-ethyl per gallon) ; and Pratt’s pure commercial benzole. For
each of these fuels the gas samples were analysed with the engine running under four

different conditions.
Experiments have also been conducted on other fuels in order to elucidate certain
