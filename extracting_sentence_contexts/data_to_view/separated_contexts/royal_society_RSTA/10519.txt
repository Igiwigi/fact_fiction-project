G. FILON ON AN APPROXIMATE SOLUTION FOR BENDING A

sections distorted. As a matter of fact, what really happens at a built-in end is
quite unknown. Under these conditions any solution which makes U = 0, dV/dx=0
over the ends must be restricted to the case of an infinite continuous beam resting
upon a series of equidistant supports, each at the same vertical height; the load
carried by the beam being exactly repeated over each span. A rail under its own
weight and carried on sleepers is an approximate example, In this case PocHHAMMER
and Rrptireâ€™s solutions are exact, and it is then legitimate to make the span as small
as we please.
