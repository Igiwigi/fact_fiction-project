s.d. of disturbances = 11-43 points.

‘The estimate of the period is now much closer to that usually given, and I think it may be
concluded that the reason assigned for the low value obtained from the ungraduated
numbers is correct.

For lack of space on the plate a graph has not been given of the disturbances as
calculated from (16). The scatter is greatly reduced (s.d. of disturbances 11-43 against
17-05), but the general course of affairs is very similar to that shown by the graph for the
ungraduated numbers.

The graphic test was applied to see whether the regression of wu, + u,_, ON U,_, Was,
in fact, appreciably linear or no. Figs. 3 and 4 show dot-diagrams for the ungraduated
and the graduated numbers respectively. It will be seen that over the greater part of
the range the regression is effectively linear. But for the larger negative deviations
(low values of the sunspot numbers) there is an appreciable, though small, divergence

from linearity affecting some 10 per cent. of the points. On the whole, however,
divergence from linearity does not look as if it would be a serious trouble.
