222 Â©. M. YONGE: STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF ORGANS OF

the surrounding tissues, great numbers of phagogytes which actively ingest food particles. Their presence, also, appears to be correlated with the finely divided nature of the food
and the fact that, but for the digestive action of these phagocytes, particles of food,
unless sufficiently fine to enter the ducts of the digestive diverticula, can only be digested
if composed of starch or glycogen. The only extracellular digestive enzymes in the gut
of the Lamellibranchs, namely, those set free by the dissolution in the stomach of the
head of the crystalline style, act exclusively on these two carbohydrates. Owing to their deep water habitat, the Septibranchs have been little studied, but
PELSENEER (1891, 1911) and PLaTE (1897) have reported, on the evidence of the stomach
contents, that they are carnivorous, while all investigators who have worked upon them
have shown that in structure both the food collecting and digestive organs of the
Septibranchs are quite distinct from those of the other Lamellibranchs.
