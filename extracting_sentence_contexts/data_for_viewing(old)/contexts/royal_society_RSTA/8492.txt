deviation of only 1° in the original readings of the total rotation of the column of quartz.
The wave-lengths given by Huprers for the three other cadmium lines which are
included in our new series of readings lead to differences of +7, +9 and +2

between the observed and calculated rotations; these differences are larger than
those recorded for the corresponding section of the iron-arc spectrum, but they are
small enough to indicate that the wave-lengths given by Huppers are again
substantially correct.

(iii) Silver.—The six silver lines of the old series of readings are all beyond the limits
covered by the standard interferometer readings of the iron arc, and the published
wave-lengths are grossly divergent. We have, therefore, again been unable to use them
to check the validity of our formule ; but, in view of the fact that these formule have been
proved to be valid over the whole range from 25,000 to 2373 A.U., there did not appear to
be any serious risk in using them for extrapolation over a further range of 100 A.U. The
wave-lengths which we have calculated on this basis agree very well with the values of
Hupprrs, when these are diminished by 0-08 A.U., in accord with the known correction
on Rowxanps’ wave-lengths in this part of the spectrum. We, therefore, conclude that
these wave-lengths (which are approximately the mean of the values given by Frrines

and by Huppsrs) are substantially correct.
