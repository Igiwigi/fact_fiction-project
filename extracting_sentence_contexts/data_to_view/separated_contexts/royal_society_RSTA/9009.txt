In
the first case the ionization was ionization by the electrons ejected from hydrogen
plus that by the net gain of electrons from aluminium at the end. In the second case
the ionization was produced by electrons from the air itself plus that produced by
electrons from aluminium ends, Approximately these are (a) ionization in hydrogen
by electrons from the aluminium plates, and (6) ionization in air by its own
Ã©lectrons plus a comparatively small ionization in air by a net gain of electrons
from the aluminium plates at the end of the chamber. (The latter of these might
have been approximately eliminated from the results of experiments on the
corpuscular radiation from aluminium, This was unnecessary, however; an approxi-
mate correction was obtained by extrapolation.)

Homogeneous beams of various wave-lengths were employed, and the relative
ionizations in air and in aluminium were obtained. A correction had, however, to be
made to the relative ionizations obtained in this way, for the air ionization was due
to the electrons ejected from a given mass of air, whereas the aluminium ionization
was produced by the electrons from a mass which increased with the frequency of the
primary radiation, This is due to the fact that the shorter the wave-length of
the primary radiation, the greater is the velocity of electrons which this radiation
ejects, consequently the greater is the depth of material from which they emerge. An approximate correction for this may, however, be found by extrapolation. This
is explained below in its application to the determination of the relative ionizations
in air and in copper.
