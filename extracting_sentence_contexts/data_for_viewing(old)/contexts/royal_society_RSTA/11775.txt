& has been shown by Hersert Tomuison that the atomic volume of metals is
Sitimately connected with their thermal capacity* and with Youne’s modulus,t He
onsiders in view of the work of Werruer,} of MAxwet,§ and of Hxren,|| and as
She result of his own experiments, that the value of the product of the elasticity E,
‘Shen multiplied by a fractional power of the atomic volume, A/D, is a constant for
ill metals, E (A/D)* = 181 x 10%. The divergencies shown by several metals from
‘Bhis mean value arise from the fact that the presence of small amounts of impurity
makes a great difference in their elasticity.

SuTHERLAND‘ finds a close relation between the atomic volume and the rigidity
.ef metals, and considers that this rigidity is “in its essence a kinetic phenomenon
‘almost as simple in character as the elasticity of perfect gases.”

S$, Professor FrssENDEN,** moreover, has urged that the cohesion of metals is
“proportional to some power of the atomic volume, and he considers that the rigidity
fxaries as the fifth power of the distance of the centre of the atoms, or as (atomic
=olume)"*. These facts are given merely to show that the atomic volume of the
@aded element is very important.
