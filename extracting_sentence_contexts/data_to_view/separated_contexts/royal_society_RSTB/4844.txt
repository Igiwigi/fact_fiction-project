in both tests, and by the same amount (47 per cent.). This shows that the discrepancy
is not mainly due to convection currents in the air of the nest, for they would have
accentuated it at the higher temperature. The escape of the moisture must thus
have been mainly by diffusion, and the cause of the higher value of A is probably
the fact that the eggs in the circular nest could not be packed so closely as those
in the rectangular trough of fig. 7. A small increase in the width of the narrow
air passages between the eggs would mean a considerable increase in the diffusion
through them. B was, of course, calculated with 1-32 cm. as the value of 4.
