The network is more regular in a shallow layer of liquid
than in a deeper one, and the meshes are smaller and separate groups may be
produced. The aggregation in the presence of air is not so persistent as when air is excluded. This is due to the fact that, in contact with air, the Euglene gradually become
encysted and form a scum of non-motile cells at the surface of the liquid. If, instead
of air, the surface is in contact with carbon dioxide, the Euglenze remain motile, and
the aggregation persists for a much longer time. This tends to support KHAwkINE’s
suggestion (’86) that the persistent motility of the organism under certain conditions
is due to its excitation by irritant vapours produced by the putrefactive substances in

the liquid in which it normally lives, and among these may, perhaps, be reckoned
carbon dioxide.
