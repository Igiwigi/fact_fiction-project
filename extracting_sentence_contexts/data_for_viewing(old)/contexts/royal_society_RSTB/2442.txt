and the details of the gametophyte. It must not be anticipated that all the
characters named will run parallel with strict exactness; all that is contended is
that, allowing a reasonable margin for variation from type, there is a substantial
parallelism of characters drawn from these varied sources.

We shall therefore be prepared to consider the following main divisions of the
Ferns, based upon the characters of the sorus, but supported by collateral lines of
evidence : (1) Those with simultaneous origin of the sporangia in the sorus, which
may be designated Simplices ; (2) those with a regular basipetal succession, which
may be called Gradate; and (3) those in which the various ages are irregularly
intermixed, the Miate. It will be the object of this memoir to bring forward
detailed facts in support of this division of the Ferns. As regards the arrangement
of the description I shall, as far as is consistent with the clear statement of facts,
follow the order of the ‘Synopsis Filicum,’ and it will be seen that in many respects
the arrangement of that work coincides with the natural grouping which will be
arrived at towards the close. The chief departure from Hooxer’s arrangement will
be to bring the Schizeeacese and Osmundace into relation with the Gleicheniacez ;
this is done with the object of grouping together at once those Leptosporangiate
Ferns which, together with the Marattiaceze, constitute our first category of Simplices.
Matonia will also be associated with these. I shall find it desirable to take Loxwsoma
next after the Simplices, as it differs from other Ferns with a basipetal sorus in the
median dehiscence of the sporangia. Other rearrangements of genera will also be
made ; but without specifying these here, it may be said that the sequence of the
‘Synopsis Filicum’ will be adhered to as far as possible.
