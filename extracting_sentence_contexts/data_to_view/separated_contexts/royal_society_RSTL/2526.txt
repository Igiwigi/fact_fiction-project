It was therefore natural, that on my arrival at Naples shortly after the mountain
had 8ubsided into a state of comparative repose, I should seize upon the opportunity
which appeared to offer of increasing my acquaintance with volcanic phenomena ;
first, by collecting on the spot such information as could be best relied on, with
respect to the leading features of the past eruption; and secondly, by ascertaining
from personal examination the actual condition of the volcano, and the products re-
sulting either from its late operations, or from those in actual progress. With a view to the former object, I solicited and obtained from the Cavaliere
Mowr1cgiu (one of the Foreign Members of the Geological Society) a written account
of the eruption, from which he has permitted me to extract such particulars as I might
deem likely to interest the Members of the Royal Society ; whilst in the hope of ac-
complishing the latter object, a considerable portion of the time I spent at Naples
was taken up in visiting the sevyeral parts of Vesuvius, and in collecting the solid as
well as aeriform substances, ejected from its crater, and from the recently erupted
lava. In the former part, therefore, of the present communication, I can claim no further
$hare, than as the compiler of facts observed and reported to me by others; and all
that I conceive myself personally responsible for is the latter portion, in which I
have stated the several products and actual condition of the volcano at the time I
visited it.
