mutual inductance M of a coil of radius A and circle of radius a. The rates of
variation of M with change in the diameter of the coil are calculated for various
values of a/A, and it is shown that when a/A increases in value the rate of variation
of M with change in @ and also of A increases. Further, it is shown that, by using
two coils separated to a considerable distance, it is possible so to proportion the radii
and the distance apart of the coils that the error of mean radius of the coil does not
affect the result; the diameter of the dise and the distance apart of the two coils are
then the important quantities. Lord Rayieren remarks: “It is clear that M
vanishes both when A is very small and when it is very large; from which it follows
that there must be some value of A for which the effect is a maximum and therefore
independent of small variations of A.”, The same is, of course, true for the dise ; by
suitably proportioning the dimensions, the error of mean radius of the dise may be
rendered negligibly small. This fact led Mr. A. CAmpBeti* to design a standard of
mutual inductance in which the radius of the secondary is not required to be known
with great precision ; it also guided us in fixing the dimensions of our coils and dises
so that the diameters of the latter need not be accurately known.

In the first and second series of experiments carried out by Lord Rayteten the
inductance coils were situated nearly in the plane of the revolving disc as in LORENz’s
original use of the method. In the third series the coils were separated from the
dise to such a distance as to render the accuracy of the results practically independent
of the mean radius of the coils. It is right to say here that in the design of the
apparatus described in this paper we were largely influenced by Lord RayLercn’s
investigations and by Mr. Camppett’s work.
