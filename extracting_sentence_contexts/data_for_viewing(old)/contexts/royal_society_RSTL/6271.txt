The average height of the adult male varied from 67:8 to 65 inches, of the female
from 63:2 to 61:6 inches; while the mean weight of the former varied from 112-12 to
91:5 Ibs., and of the latter from 95-2 to 76:9, showing a preponderance in the insane
male of 6 1bs., and in the insane female of 8 1bs., as compared with the sane adults dying
at the same period of life.

The average weight of the right cerebral hemisphere varied in the males from 20-89
0z, to 18:97 oz., and in the females from 19-21 oz. to 17-20 oz.; the left varied in the
males from 21:05 oz. to 18:62 oz., and from 19:51 oz. to 17:39 oz. in the females. It is
a sngular fact, confirmed by the examination of nearly 200 cases at St. Marylebone, in
which the hemispheres were weighed separately, that almost invariably the weight
of the left exceeded that of the right by at least the eighth of an ounce. In the Med.
Chir. Trans. vol. XXXiX., 8everal cases of inequalities of the cerebral hemispheres which
came under my notice are given. The average weight of the cerebellum varied in the
males from 5:42 oz. to 5:06 oz., and from 5 to 4-74 0z. in the females; that of the pons
Varolii and medulla in the males from 1:15 oz. to 1-02 oz., and from 1:05 to +95 oz.
