The posterior part of the angle where the inner surface cuts the dorsal surface, is
chamfered off by a face for attachment of the supraoccipital. The interpretation of the grooves on the inner surface of the otic bones is very difficult ;
they are obviously associated with the semicircular canals, and the certain absence of
any foramina tunnelling the bones shows that they must represent impressions of the
outer surface of the labyrinth, that organ lying entirely within the bony cranial cavity,
not separated from the brain by any bone. The conditions must, in fact, have been
as in certain bony fish, and as in the rachitomous amphibian Trimerorachis. The
basisphenoid and parasphenoid are indistinguishably fused. Posteriorly, the joint bone
forms a thin film covering the ventral and lateral surfaces of the basioccipital ; but
leaving the dorsal part of the lateral surface of that bone exposed.
