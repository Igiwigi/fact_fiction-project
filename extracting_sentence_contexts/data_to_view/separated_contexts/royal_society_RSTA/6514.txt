The idea that natural systems, structures or materials may have design elements that
could be usefully applied to manufactured technology is old, and the transfer of these
elements into human technology has had several names (‘biomimetics’, ‘biomimesis’,
‘biognosis’ and ‘bionics’). In its simplest form, a direct copy, it is in fact ancient,
e.g. da Vinci’s bat-winged human-powered flying machine. Straight copies like da
Vinci’s are illuminating in that they are rarely workable, and highlight the need
for understanding of the underlying engineering principles. These principles must
be understood before the correct application area in manufactured technology can
be identified and exploited.
