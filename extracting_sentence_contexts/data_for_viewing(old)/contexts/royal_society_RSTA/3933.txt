Considering that silver degradation compounds are not easily detectable by means of regular
Raman spectrometers, definitive evidence was provided by the use of the coupled SEM-Raman
system. The spectra obtained by the analysis of several selected points of the silver surface showed
the characteristic peaks of silver chloride (97, 143 and 233 cm-1; figure 1b) [35], a degradation
compound often found in Ag-containing artefacts from archaeological sites near the coast.

During the analysis of sample M02, both optical and SEM images acquired from the outer
surface of this fragment (which was in contact with the soil during burial) showed the presence
of white filamentous incrustations. The elemental maps (figure 2a) proved that these filaments
were mainly composed of calcium. Raman analysis carried out inside the SEM chamber allowed
us to identify the molecular composition of these incrustations (figure 2b) as calcium carbonate
(CaCO3, main Raman peak at 1085 cm~'). The particular structure of such degradation suggests a
calcification process promoted by biological activity. In fact, manifold varieties of organisms able
to mineralize CO to carbonate compounds such as CaCO3 are usually present in soils [36].

(ii) Cross-section analysis

The instruments used for the characterization of the surfaces of samples M01 and M02 were also
applied to study the cross-sections of samples M03 and M04.

M03 fragment was first analysed to better understand the gilded layer composition. As can
be observed in figure 3, several elemental maps proved the presence of two decorative layers.
The inner one was composed of pure silver and was overlapped by a gold-based coat applied by
fire gilding. As described in several Middle Ages manuscripts, the accessories belonging to both
squires and knights contained a rigorous symbolism: the squires could wear only silver-plated
