expression regulation through many diverse mechanisms,
which we have reviewed here.

The prevalence of TE utilization for regulatory functions
may differ between cell types and developmental stages.
Indeed, TEs seem to play an outsized role during mammalian
pre- and peri-implantation development, where whole
subclasses of TEs (such as MERVL in mice, or HERV-K and
HERV-H in humans) function in host gene regulation as
alternative promoters, enhancers or boundary elements. This
widespread utilization of TEs during early development is
likely facilitated both by the global epigenomic de-repression
during this time of embryogenesis and by the fact that to suc-
cessfully propagate through vertical transmission, ancestral
TEs must have been able to direct transcription of their own
sequences in toti/pluripotent cells or germ cells. Conse-
quently, many evolutionarily young TEs, which are typically
species- or clade-specific, can bind toti- and pluripotency-
associated TFs. We speculate that, at least in mammals,
transcriptional divergence during early development, as
postulated by the hourglass model, is largely mediated by
the massive co-option of TEs for host gene regulation.

By contrast, in somatic tissues, epigenomic control is
restored and TEs are largely repressed via a multitude of chro-
