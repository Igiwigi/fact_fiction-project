As this method of sounding is new and clearly of importance if substantiated,
considerable attention has been given to its illustration, but as the details themselves
are only necessary for a critical study they have been printed in smaller type and
may be omitted on a first reading. Abnormal D triplet Separations.—It has generally been held since RypBeEre’s
discovery of the satellite systems that the triplet separations for the D and § series
are the same. The actual measures did not absolutely prove this, in fact, they
indicated small differences, but the accuracy was not sufficient to establish a real
difference especially as against a natural bias to expect equality. MrGGErs,* however,
has recently placed it beyond doubt that frequently the separations are really
different. In Group L, for instance, the separations as measured from D lines are
less than those determined from § lines.
