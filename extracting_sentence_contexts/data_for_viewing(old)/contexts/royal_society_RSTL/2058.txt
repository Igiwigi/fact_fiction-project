IN THE MORE PERFECT ANIMALS. 65

For the same reason a similar effect is produced on the muscles by what
surgeons call concussion of the brain. A strong solution of opium or tobacco
thrown into the cavity of the abdomen, or suddenly applied to any other ex-
tensive and highly sensible surface, has the same effect on the muscles as a
blow on the head. It affects them in consequence of the brain and spinal mar-
row being influenced, and probably, where the cause is most powerful, having
their finer mechanism deranged by the impression made on the sentient extre-
mities of the nerves; $0 that we have here only an instance of a well-known
fact, that certain affections of the brain and spinal marrow are capable of im-
pairing the excitability of the muscles through the medium of the nerves, the
only medium of course through which they can operate*.

How can we $uppose, it has been said in support of the same opinion, that,
a muscle covered by a membrane of condensed cellular su√æbstance, or in other
instances by the more complicated serous or mucous membrane, should be
affected by a chemical agent applied to the opposite surface of such mem-
branes, if not through the medium of its nerves ?

If the agent does not pass through the membrane, and is thus immediately
applied to the fibres of the muscle, by what other means can the effect be pro-
duced? We have just seen that the nerves are incapable of communicating
