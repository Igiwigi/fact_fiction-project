1. Our improved understanding of star cluster physics

It is now widely accepted that stars do not form in isolation, at least for
stellar masses above approximately 0.5 Mo. In fact, 70-90% of stars may form
in a clustered mode (cf. Lada & Lada 2003). Star formation results from the
fragmentation of molecular clouds, which in turn preferentially leads to star
cluster formation.
