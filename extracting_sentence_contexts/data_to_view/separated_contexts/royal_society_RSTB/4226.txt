conspicuous rounded cavity likewise enclosed by epithelially arranged cells, and

evidently formed from the part of the cleft-lumen formerly continued into it. Cavities
of this sort, though not always directly traceable to remnants of the pouch-lumen, are
of frequent occurrence in later stages in both thymus III and IV. They are not
present in thymus III of this stage and, in fact, are always more numerous in
thymus IV than in thymus II. We shall refer to them henceforth as thymic
cavities. The ultimobranchial body (fig. 38, u.b.) has also lost connection with the
