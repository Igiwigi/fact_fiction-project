the spindle-like form is still maintained, and that the outer electric cone is not, as in
fig. 8, invested by muscular cones. About the middle of its length, however, the
organ loses its oval contour and projects inwards by a keel-like ridge as far as the
vertebral column (Plate 27, fig. 10). In sections near the middle of the organ only
portions of the base of the fifth cone are as a rule visible, and the dorso-lateral and
dorso-ventral rows of muscular cones can no longer be detected.

For some distance beyond the middle of the organ the concentric arrangement so
well marked in front is still evident (Plate 27, fig. 11) ; but as the posterior end is
reached it becomes obscured, partly owing to the shortening of the cones and partly
owing to the relation of the organ to the vertebral column. It is important to note
that the outer portions of the bases of all the cones come into contact with the skin,
and this notwithstanding the fact that the anterior part of the organ is completely
invested by the lateral row of muscular cones (Plate 27, fiz. 6). But while the outer
part of the base of each cone reaches the skin, the inner part is in contact first with
the dorsal and ventral rows of muscular cones, and beyond the middle of the tail
with, in addition to the muscles or their tendons, the centra of the caudal vertebrae
(Plate 27, figs. 10 and 11), with which it comes into more intimate relation as the tip of
the tail is reached,
