* That is when the temperature is constant again after the effects of changing the pressure have
disappeared. Constancy of temperature is indicated by the fact that there is no further movement in the
mercury ; indeed, the piezometer is in effect a very sensitive thermometer. + For, on increasing the pressure, the lubricant is compressed, and as there is a slight difference
in pressure due to the unbalanced height of the mercury in the stem, the key may move slightly into
its seating; this movement obviously is not reversible. Occasionally, another source of trouble was
encountered, namely, that caused by a small bubble of air left in the key of the tap when filling the
piezometer ; this bubble could be seen easily, but it was found to be there sometimes even in the new
form about to be described.
