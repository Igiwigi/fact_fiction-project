wedge bend inwards more or less obviously towards an imaginary line prolonged through
the centre of the wedge into the bark. Indications of this arrangement are een at g'
in fig. 32.

The usual aspect of the masses of cortical parenchyma separating the primary vascular
wedges, as they appear in vertical tangential sections, is shown in several of the figures,
but especially in figs. 27, 30, & 35, h. In these sections it appears as ordinary paren-
chyma, whilst in radial sections of the same tissue its cells exhibit a tendency to
arrange themselves in semimural fashion, as seen at fig. 27, Ã¾/'.

External to the cortical structures just described is another and yet more extensive
one, which appears to have been the primitive tissue of these stems. I infer this from
the fact that in the young twigs (figs. 24 & 25) it is the only cortical tissue observable,
except the epidermal layer (&), and occupies the entire area between that layer and
the central vascular bundle (c). Its thickness relative to the size of the stem is also
well seen in fig. 23, It consists of a coarse but thin-walled parenchyma, the cells of
which are of unequal sizes, but generally about 005. The mean thickness of this
layer in fig. 23 is about 025. It appears distinctly in figs. 32, 33, & 34, 5, investing
both the vascular axis of the primary stem and the branch which is being given off
from the latter; whilst in fig. 34, in which the vascular area of the branch is entirely
Separated from that of the main axis, it constitutes the chief portion of the separating
layer. In the three sections just referred to, whilst we see the tissue in question
enclosing the more internal layers of the bark and their associated vascular areas, it
will also be noticed that in passing over the cellular radii which separate the six large
vascular wedges it dips inwards towards the centre of the stem. This arrangement is
