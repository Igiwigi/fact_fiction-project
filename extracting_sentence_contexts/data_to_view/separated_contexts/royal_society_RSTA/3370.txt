An initial increase of p up to a certain critical value
Pc is followed by a subsequent decrease. This behaviour can be analysed in the frame of a
phase slip based model [31,49,50]. The observed dissipation, in fact, is induced by phase slip
mechanism: at short times, for p < pc, the oscillation is only weakly damped; at larger times the
phase slip rate diverges and the system enters a dynamically unstable regime, characterized by
a strong damping. The value of p where the experimental data points deviate with respect to
the theoretical curve can be identified with the critical momentum pz, for the occurrence of the
dynamical instability [49,50]. By increasing the scattering length, the damping rate at short times
increases, as the phase slip nucleation rate increases, while pc decreases.
