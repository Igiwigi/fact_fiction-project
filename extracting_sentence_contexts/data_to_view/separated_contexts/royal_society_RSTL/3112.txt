To these statements it
may be added, that in many of the inferior animals the foregoing supposed
causes of the venous part of the circulation evidently have no existence, and
that, with the exception of the elasticity of the heart, they have no existence in
the fetal state in any. We have just seen from direct experiment, that the circulation of the blood
goes on as usual when all these canses have wholly ceased to operate. I shall now take a rapid view of the facts which, as far as I am capable of
judging, leave no room of doubt respecting the sources of the power on which
this function depends. It is 80 evident to those in the least acquainted with the animal economy
that the contractile power of the heart is one of the chief of these sources, that
it would be superfluous to enumerate the proofs of it; yet even this position has
been denied, and that by a writer of no mean abilities.
