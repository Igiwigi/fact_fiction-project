(a) Objects and phenomena

Our most basic assumption is the existence of a natural world. This world is objective, i.e. it exists
independently of any observer. The world can be analysed in systems, i.e. finite entities which are
also objective. As it is a finite entity, a system is surrounded by a large number of other systems
that we call a context. Note that, as a finite entity, a context can also play the role of a system, and
be embedded in another context.

On the other hand, the natural world is the theatre of phenomena, i.e. actual physical events. : =
As they are actual and objective, phenomena are unique and well determined, and they exist : S
independently of any observer. A system and its context define a possible partition of the world, 12
which may be considered as objective (and not fictitious) when it gives rise to such well-defined D4
phenomena. :

(b) States 8

Let us consider such an objective partition consisting of a system and a context. This partition is aS
quite generic and can describe situations of the everyday life: for instance, a table as the system, .
and as possible contexts, two cameras measuring ‘Position’ and ‘Colour’. It can also capture the
situations encountered in the laboratory, involving a quantum system (like an electronic spin),
while the context is the measuring apparatus (like a Stern—Gerlach apparatus). To grasp the
meaning of a state, we adopt an operational approach and suppose we can act on the settings
of the context, giving rise to different phenomena. A given setting at time t; is denoted by C(t),
and corresponds to a ‘question’. (For instance, which camera is on determines if the question
