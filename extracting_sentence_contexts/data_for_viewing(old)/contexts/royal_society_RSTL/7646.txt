system which surrounds its base; and still better in the transparent section represented
in Plate LXXVI. fig. 1, where two of the interspaces are seen to be traversed by © radial
tubes? 2, 2, which do not form part of the ordinary *radial processes” A careful exa-
mination of the entire section of which only a small part is here figured, has fully satis-
fied me of the universality of this communication ; notwithstanding that (as at the upper
part of the tube 7, Plate LXXIII. fig. 4) it often appears to be interrupted, —the fracture
or section not having happened to lay open the apertures or passages of connexion. And
further, I have been enabled to satisfy myself, by the use of adequate magnifying power,
that notwithstanding the smooth shelly aspect which the walls of the *radial tubes' often
present, they are in reality built up, like the lamellz between which they pass, of aggre-
gated sand-grains,—a fact which may be regarded as justifying the like interpretation of
the appearance presented by the snbstance of the Nucleus ($ 10).

16. When a sufficiently high magnifying-power is applied to transparent sections
thin enough to bear it, s0 as to bring into view the forms of the individual sand-
grains and the mode of their aggregation, a curious diyersity is observable as to both
these particulars between different individuals. In the two non-infiltrated specimens
T have thus examined, the sand-grains are angular, and are fitted together with marvel-
lous exactness, as shown in Plate LXXV. tig. 2; in which we see, moreover, that each
of the partitions, p, p, which separate the chamberlets ec, c, is formed of at least three
layers of apposed sand-grains. In the specimens which have undergone calcareous in-
filtration, the forms of the individual sand-grains cannot be clearly made out ; but in
the thickness and solidity of the partitions between their chamberlets, they agree with
