Both the number of the alimentary diverticula and that of the embracing segmental organs have been
very much reduced, for the sake of distinetness, in this figure.

be more beautiful than a portion of this tubular network (taken from the female organ).
The individual tubes are bridled (A e) on one side, and glandular (A 4) on the other.
A similar structure is exhibited by the male tubes (B 4).

The author thinks it probable that if the roots or attached ends (a, . fig. 28) of these
organs could only be followed through the integuments to their extreme outlets, they
would be found to divide into two limbs, an ingoing and an outgoing ; a fact which
would account for the clearly divided ciliary currents, as they are seen in the dilated
portions (A, B) of the organs (se arrows). Tf this fact of the bifurcation of the tube
were clearly determined, there would be no difficulty whatever in connecting the seg-
mental organs of Aphrodita with their homologues in the typical Annelids. In the

x absence of proof upon this point, however, they must be described as commencing in a
S aingle tube, the internal extremity of which divides into a numerous system of branches.
2 None of these branches communicate openly with the general cavity of the body. It is
=> therefore probable that these organs are exclusively dedicated to the office of repro-
= duction. They seem unfitted to discharge any subsidiary function.
2 Now there are several features in the history of the segmental system of Aphrodita.
S which irresistibly suggest certain definite inferences as to its morphology. In the first
