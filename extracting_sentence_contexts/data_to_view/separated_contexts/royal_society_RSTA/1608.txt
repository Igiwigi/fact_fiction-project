Therefore, the

sequence of the integrals | qn(t)@n(t) dt is eventually positive and bounded away from zero,

because it is increasing. Consequently, as

it follows, for n sufficiently large, that

which is a contradiction. This concludes the proof. a

(b) The topological approach: an equivalent functional version of equation (1.5)

For the reader’s convenience, we shall briefly summarize here the main facts about Mawhin’s
coincidence degree. For details see [3-5]. Let E and F be real Banach spaces and let 2 be an open bounded subset of E.
