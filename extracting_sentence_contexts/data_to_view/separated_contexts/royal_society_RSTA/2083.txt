However, we want to point out that corrections to this constant
may become necessary, if one considers extreme changes in the force Ma(t) applied to the piston,
strong enough to change a(t) on microscopic time scales, so that a(t)At ~ a(t + At)A¥ is no longer
true on overage.

(a) The adiabatic dilation

Let us assume that we compress (expand) adiabatically, moving the piston from position L; to
some position L2 in a timespan t. If at position Li the working gas has temperature T;, we may
ask the question for which piston position Ly < L; (Lz > L;) the working gas will reach a given
temperature Tz > T; (T2 < T1). It is not difficult to write down the exact equations for the problem,
in fact it is equation (4.2), but one cannot, in general, solve this equation explicitly as it is of higher


order polynomial rank. Fortunately, we can solve it in a linear approximation. By assuming that
cycle periods are large enough for the piston position Lz = L} + ALz, to vary only by a comparably
small, AL < |L2 — Li|, where L3 is the would be piston position if the system would undergo a
reversible adiabatic process ending in temperature T2, one can compute ALy in a perturbative
manner.
