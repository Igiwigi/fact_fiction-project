All
of this explains why observed incidence rates of burglaries are locally smooth. However, local smoothness is not always appropriate, and in practice there is much room
for improvement. In recent years, several studies on the application of MPLE to crime data
[13-15] emphasize the fact that crime density should have boundaries corresponding to the local
geography. Mohler et al. [13] and KostiÂ¢ et al. [15] model this by choosing penalty functions that
are edge-preserving, TV and Ginzburg-Landau, respectively. Smith et al. [14] more closely follow
the idea presented here.
