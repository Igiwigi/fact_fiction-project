The mean value obtained for Fork B by the process of stepping up and ea through
the multivibrators was :—
Fork B at 18-6° C, = 969-39, in terms of Fork A of nominal value 1000-00,. Correct-
ing these results for the error of A and to a temperature of 18-55° C., we get :—
By multivibrator .. A, Fork B at 18-5,° C. = 969-36, cycles per second.

This agreement may be considered very satisfactory and can be considered to remove

every trace of uncertainty as to the validity of the harmonic principle of building-up
frequency in view of the fact that four harmonic stages intervene in the calculation
and measurement of fork B in terms of fork A.

5. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE DESIGN OF THE WAVE-METER.

The experiments and investigations just described gave a great deal of valuable
experience and information for guidance in the design of the complete self-contained
instrument. Before proceeding to details it is desirable to set down clearly the
behaviour of the wave-meter as used to set the frequency of another source or to
measure it. This may be summarised as follows :

(a) For Frequencies up to 120 Kilocycles per Second.
