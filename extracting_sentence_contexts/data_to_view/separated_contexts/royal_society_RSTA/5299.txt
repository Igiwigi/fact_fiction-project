This process for the determination of gold was employed for every one of the fore-
going aluminium-gold alloys. Conclusions. I regret that time has not enabled me to examine more members of each particular
Series of alloys, so as to present results in fuller detail; in fact, the silver-copper
series is the only one upon which anything like exhaustive work has been done. ; No
doubt, in every series of alloys there is one definite alloy which would yield a uniform

mass on cooling, and it is known that in the silver-copper series this alloy (LEvot’s)
contains 718 parts of silver per thousand. It is not certain, however, that this is the
euctectic alloy of the series—that is, the one with the lowest melting point—but it is
well known that when silver-copper alloys which contain more silver than 718 parts
per thousand are cooled, the centre of the solidified mass is richer than the exterior.
