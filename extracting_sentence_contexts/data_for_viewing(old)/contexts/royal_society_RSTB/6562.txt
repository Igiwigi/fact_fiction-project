mechanical factors as the tension of the cord at the moment and the amount of material
contained in it. The movement is a striking one and has been referred to by several
writers (e.g. MULLER 1844; VAN WHE 1916; etc.), but it has not always been appre-
ciated that the ilio-colon ring is the sole propulsive agent. Thus according to RicE
(1880) the cilia of the “‘stomach”’ are so disposed that they force the food into a rope-
like body and cause it to rotate, while ANDREws (1893), describing the passage of the
cord through the centre of the “‘stomach”’ in Assymetron (which may, of course, differ
from Amphioxus), writes that it is now revolving rapidly from right to left and continues
to do so throughout the next division of the digestive tract. To continue with the
present account, the cord continues to pass backwards, and so long as the portion
behind the ilio-colon ring remains continuous with the portion within the ring it
continues to be affected by the rotation. Sooner or later, however, a portion breaks
off, and it then no longer rotates, a fact which again illustrates that the ring is the
propulsive agent. Once such a portion has broken off, it begins to pass slowly down
the hind-gut, and its rate of progress can be measured by noting the time at which
it passes the several myomeres. One such portion, selected at random, broke off
from the main mass at 11.23 a.m., at which time it was opposite the third myoseptum
behind the atriopore, and was expelled at 1.274 p.m., having thus passed down the

hind-gut in 2 hr. 44 min. Some ten myomeres had to be passed on the way, and
most of the passage was slow and regular; towards the end, however, movement was
suddenly speeded up, and the last three myomeres were passed in 34 min. The
