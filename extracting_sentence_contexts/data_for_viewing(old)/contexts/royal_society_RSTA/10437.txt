As a result of these experiments it may be asserted that, in alum at any rate, the
vicinal faces are neither produced nor appreciably affected by the concentration
streams in the solution.

The vicinal faces may, however, vary with the average concentration of the
solution in their neighbourhood, or—what may amount to the same thing—with
their rate of growth, In fact, it is difficult to think of any other nearly constant,
but slightly variable, condition to which they may reasonably be attributed. In any
case, the fact to which I wish to draw attention is that the faces which actually occur
upon a crystal are not those with simple indices and great reticular density, but
those with complex indices and low reticular density.

The faces of alum whose angles were measured by Brauns, and whose rate of
growth was measured by WEYBERG, were, therefore, not octahedron faces at all, but
vicinal faces, and in the arguments relating to them we are not at liberty to assume
that they are faces of high reticular density.

Whatever structures may be necessary to account for other features of crystals,
there is little doubt that we are justified in regarding their faces as the planes of a
space-lattice. Now there is one remarkable property of the space-lattice which bears
closely upon the present problem. In general, two planes of the lattice which are
