Hence we have to make (i#e4Lt)L(nLy,
i.e. e+2—1 quantities (which are linear in respect to the given" coefficients in
P and Q, as well as in respect to the new! disposable constants in P, and Q,) all
vanish, that is to say, there will be e+2:;—1 linear homogeneous equations to be
satisfied by means of e+2: disposable quantities ; the ratios of these latter are, there-
fore, determinate, 80 that we may write

and when (P,), (Q,), (R,) are taken prime to one another, it is obvious that (R,) will

coefficients of P, and of e+: in respect of those' of Q : A, will correspond to' what I
have previously called the allotrious factor; being in fact foreign to the value of R,
as determined by means of the equation (4.), and arising only from the particalar
method employed to obtain it throngh the medium of the system (1.): it becomes a
matter of some interest and importance to determine the values of this allotrious
factor for different values of *. * These are identical with what I termed quotients of succession in the London and Edinburgh Philosophical
Magazine (December, 1839) ; but by an easily explicable error of inadvertence, the quantities © Q,,” ** Q,,” &e.

selves, but the ratios of each such to the one preceding, if in the series ; x0 that—
