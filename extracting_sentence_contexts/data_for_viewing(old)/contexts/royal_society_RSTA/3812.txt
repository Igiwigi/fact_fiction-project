the wall-normal direction for all locations below the outer spectral peak, we can easily see a
high degree of correlation throughout. This correlation is higher for case D (higher turbulence
intensity) compared with case B (lower turbulence intensity). This confirms the observation
from the spectrograms that the energy levels that reside in the near-wall region owing to the
penetration of FST increase with turbulence level in the free stream. When compared with a
values from [11] for a canonical case, higher values are observed for FST cases. This is a result
of FST scales penetrating the boundary layer. The model takes into account the inclination angle
of the large-scale structures; therefore requires shifting the outer probe signal forward in the
streamwise direction (assuming Taylor’s hypothesis) for the corresponding time shift between
the large-scale signals from both probes. The inclination angle is typically within 12° and 16°,
cf. [11] and references therein including [22-24]. This study exhibits similar large-scale structural
organization with an inclination angle that is relatively constant between 11° < 6, < 15° for wall-
normal locations yt < 150. Although FST disturbs the boundary layer from outside, the fact that it
does not destroy the large-scale structural organization in the log region is a promising result for
