It should, however, be remarked that there
is invariably some broadening towards the violet, but not always to the same
extent as towards the red end of the spectrum. The phenomenon of broadening
may be studied in Plate 5, fig. 1, in which, however, the exposures are not quite
comparable.

2. The Displacement of the Lines.â€”A careful study of the photographs, Plate 4,
reveals the fact, first discovered by Humpureys and Monten, that there is a slight
displacement of the lines towards the ved end of the spectrum as the pressure of the
vapour about the are is increased. At low pressures it is not quite definite that this
phenomenon is not due to an unsymmetrical widening of the line, but the photographs
taken at high pressures dispose of this objection, because several lines are then
displaced so much that they are quite clear of their comparison lines. The lines f'1,

f2, J3, at 100 atmospheres, No. 9, Plate 4, show this well, and it is emphasized
in the enlargement, Plate 8, and in Plate 6, fig. 1, in which the shift of d3 at
100 atmospheres is specially remarkable; the lines 2, 3, al, Plate 7, though not
displaced quite as much, also testify that the displacement is a real phenomenon.

* The photograph at 10 atmospheres (No. 2) is over-exposed in comparison with the other spectra.
