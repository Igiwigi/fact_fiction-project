The relative positions of the structures nd? and ndÂ°(n-+1)s are very different in the
three long periods. It might be expected that their difference would decrease as the
value of n increases. This is not the case, the difference being in fact about 8000 in Nin,
25,000 in Pdi and 5000 in Pt. The 4d and 5s electrons in the second long period
thus show much greater differences in binding energy than do the 3d and 4s of the first
period or the 5d and 6s of the third period. No theoretical explanation of this fact has
been given.
