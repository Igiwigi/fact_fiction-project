gpal arms; and TI am inclined (as will hereafter appear, $ 13) to regard that peculiarity of
fYeir character and disposition, which Lamanck was the first to notice, as connected with
tHe sensorial protection of the oral orifice.
En this edition we till find LaMarck ranking the Crrxoipres among Polypes; though
I separates them, together with Pernatula, Unbellularia, &c., into a distinct group,
that of Polypinatantes. He speaks without hesitation of their ramified arms as bearing
polypes arranged in rows (!), and remarks that they are especially distinguished from
Pennatule and other genera of the order of floating Polypes by the articulated structure
of the stem and branches. © Les Encrines,” he says (op. cit. p. 434), © se rapprochent
de I'Ombellulaire par leur ombelle terminale et polypifere ; mais leur tige et leur rameanx
articul6s, enfin la disposition des Polypes qui forment des ranges sur les rameaux de
Yombelle, les en distinguent fortement.” It is singular that 80 eminent a Naturalist
(could haye committed himself to a misstatement of fact s0 extraordinary as that just cited.
The publication of LaManck's work was very s00n followed by that of the first edition
(1817) of the *Regne Animal” of Cover, in which the Crixoiea are included (after


684 DR. W. B. CARPENTER ON THE STRUCTURE, PHYSIOLOGY, AND

the example of BLUMENBACH) in the class ECHINODERMATA ; being placed at the en
the family Asteriada, in immediate sequence to Gorgonocephala (Euryale) and Ale
(Antedon). And this position they have retained in all subsequent systems of classi
tion ; the only difference of opinion having been as to the intimacy of the relationshj
between the Crinoidea and other stellate forms of Echinodermata.
