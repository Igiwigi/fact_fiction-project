wards, and as lying above the nostrils, while the hamal arch lies in front of the
nostrils.

Lastly, in the mammalia, by the union of the palate plates of the maxillaries the
hemal arch is completed, and the ring of bone which surrounds the incisive foramina is
the anterior extremity of the ideal cylinder formed by the series of hemal arches
(fig. 27). This is best conceived of by looking at this ring in the Hare or the Rabbit.
There we see the single incisive foramen bounded in the middle line in front by the
mesial-palatine processes of the intermaxillaries, while extending backwards from them
is the hemal arch formed by intermaxillaries and maxillaries exactly as in other classes,
except that it is complete.

The fact that in certain mammals the intermaxillaries limit the anterior extremity of
the septal cartilage as much as they do in birds and lizards, embracing it at a point
morphologically anterior to the nostrils, appears to me to prove that this is the true
explanation of the facial sclerotome in the mammalia, and that the nostrils throughout

the vertebrata are intersegmental openings lying between the two most anterior segments
of the skull.
