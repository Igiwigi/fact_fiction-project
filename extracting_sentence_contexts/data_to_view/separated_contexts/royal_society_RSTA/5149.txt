Thus, geoengineering was situated as one of three options for responding to
climate change. The penultimate paragraph of all versions of the factsheet described geoengineering as
follows:

Most geoengineering technologies have not yet been developed, and so there is a great deal
of uncertainty about their risks and benefits. There are likely to be some serious risks and
side effects associated with geoengineering (e.g. changes to global rainfall patterns) but they

are not yet well understood. : =

The final paragraph of each factsheet contained a brief quote from a (fictional) expert, Professor : 3s
North (described as a ‘leading atmospheric scientist’). Depending on the experimental condition : =
participants were randomly assigned to, Professor North’s ‘quote’ was systematically varied (i.e. D8
the argument manipulation). eri
We compared the convincingness of the moral hazard argument against geoengineering with : N
an opposing argument: that geoengineering would permit high-carbon lifestyles to continue, and : S
that this would be a positive (rather than undesirable) outcome. [8
In the moral hazard condition, Professor North was reported as saying 1B

My concern is that if we start talking about the possibilities of geoengineering, and how
it could be a ‘Plan B’, we will take our eye off the ball with carbon emissions.
