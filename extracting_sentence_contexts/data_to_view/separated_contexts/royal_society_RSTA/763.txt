In this case the observations
were spread over more than four months, and the conditions were purposely changed
in several respects. For example, in a few determinations one coil system only was
used, in order that the conditions might approximate to those obtaining in the
current balance of the National Bureau of Standards, in which the system of coils
is not duplicated. The fact that the mean deviation from their mean of the results
of this group is only two parts in a million shows that the current balance repeats
to a high order of accuracy. It will be recalled that the electromagnetic force is
only 4 gm.-wt., whereas the beam, suspended coils, and fittings weigh over 14 kg. Repetition over an interval of a few years has not proved so satisfactory, and
deserves some discussion.
