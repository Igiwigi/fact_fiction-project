the conditions fluctuated ; here half the females lived for more than two months
Table IV. We can also measure the suitability of the laboratory conditions by the
birth-rate. We believe that under favourable conditions in nature, one pregnancy
succeeds another with very short intervals. In certain months, Jounson and Ltoyp
(1923) found as many as 80%, of females pregnant ; these females had approached
man, and been captured. If we assume that they were a fair sample of all the
females, it would indicate a very short interval between pregnancies, which must be
difficult to diagnose during the first few days. What birth-rate might we expect
in the laboratory at 30° C under the best conditions of humidity? The duration
of pregnancy at 30°C is not precisely known, but as puparia are occasionally
deposited on the 13th day of the female’s life, we estimate it at 12 days or a little less
(p. 189). If one pregnancy immediately succeeds another in all females, and if the
duration is 12 days, the standarized birth-rate would be 8-33. But, in fact, we
obtained 2-85, the mean of three cages which varied between 7-10 and 1-58,
Table V. It seems, therefore, that under our best conditions, the births are about
one-third of what might be expected. The figures for Glossina submorsitans are not
essentially different, and one notes that Porrs, working with morsitans at Kikori,
Tanganyika, obtained birth-rates of two or a little over (Porrs, 1933, p. 294, para. a).
It must therefore be admitted that, though Glossina appears to survive well, the birth-
rate shows that cage conditions are not as good as they might be. It is possible that
exposure to stable conditions of temperature and humidity is unfavourable to
Glossina, and we need experimental data on that point. At the same time, it would
be well to investigate the effect of light.

But in spite of difficulties and limitations, we claim certain advantages and
