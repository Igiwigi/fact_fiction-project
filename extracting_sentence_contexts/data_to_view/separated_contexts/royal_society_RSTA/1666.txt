Consequently, the only foreseeable
solution to make possible a much larger infrared telescope diameter in space conditions, needed
to answer the fundamental questions on the origin of the Universe and of the life, is on the Moon. However, the first condition to examine is the existence of potential sites for such a telescope.

3. Astronomical infrared sites on the Moon

In fact, appropriate sites for the implementation of an infrared observatory may exist on the Moon,
which was not obvious before the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) NASA mission, launched
in polar orbit around the Moon in 2009, extended up to 2018. On board, the Diviner radiometer
mapped over several years the day-night surface temperature [10]. At the equator, the largest
amplitudes of temperature variations are observed, reaching up to 397 K and dropping to 95K.
