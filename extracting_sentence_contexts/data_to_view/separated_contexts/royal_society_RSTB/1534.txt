With regard to Macacus, he remarks that FripEric Cuvier believed it possible to

indulge in sexual intercourse, not only at the breeding season, but also during
pregnancy ; and further he records F, Cuvier’s observation, that menstruation takes

about seven months, and that the gestation of M. nemestrinus has been ascertained
to be seven months and twenty days, but he gives no reference to the source from
whence he got his information. The account Dr.
