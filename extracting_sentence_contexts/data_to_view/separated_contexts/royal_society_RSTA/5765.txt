solutions g of the vacuum Einstein equations (1.1) that are sufficiently close to gh in a given
Qconst.-areal gauge. Moreover, we allow for arbitrary Q,]x,P € R with JxP =0, noting that the
Killing vector fields 0, and dy of g agree with the geometrically distinguished eigenvector fields X and
Y of the Weingarten map of the A-Kasner solution g‘X). As a consequence of the fact that we work
here with a number of space-time geometries on the manifold M—those corresponding to the
background solutions g“%) as well as those corresponding to the perturbed solutions g—for this
perturbation analysis, the quantity Q, which in [24] has been described as ‘nothing but gauge’,
now becomes the carrier of geometric information. As we explain below, of particular importance
is that the unique hypersurface orthogonal Killing vector field of g is parametrized by Q according
to (2.15) and (2.17). Choosing the Qconst.-areal gauge as opposed to the Qo-areal gauge for the
study of perturbations of A-Kasner solutions is therefore not just a matter of convenience; rather
it leads to a new class of perturbations, the consequences of which are discussed below.
