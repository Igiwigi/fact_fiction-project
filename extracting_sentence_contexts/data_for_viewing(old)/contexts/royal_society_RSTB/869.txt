stimulated near the ganglion, and therefore on the ventral aspect of the body, a
marked tetanus of the extensor muscles is found to follow stimulation.

(5.) The posterior dorsal nerves in the case of Astacus are so delicate and deep
lying, and their unbranched free portion is so extremely short, that it is impossible to
directly stimulate them without escape of the current into the muscles. The experi-
ment was therefore carried out in the following manner :—The anterior and posterior
ventral nerves were cut on both sides and in each segment of the abdomen. Thus
only the posterior dorsal nerves were left intact. The nerve cord was then cut in the
thoracic region and lifted on to the electrodes. On opening the circuit the abdomen
was sharply flexed.

The facts both of dissection and stimulation thus lead to the conclusion that the
anterior nerves are of mixed function, and contain both afferent and efferent fibres.
But they mainly supply sensory surfaces, The posterior ventral nerves are also of
mixed function, but they supply a relatively larger mass of muscles, and a much more
