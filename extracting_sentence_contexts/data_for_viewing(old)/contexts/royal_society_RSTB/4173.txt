and Sangorn(?*) say the effect of moisture in the air upon the convection of heat
from a thin wire seems to be small. They did not measure it. Prraver(*) found the
loss 20 per cent. greater in moist than in dry air.

Another striking fact brought into prominence by the study of the curves in fig. 5
is that the graph connecting rate of total heat-loss in still air and the difference in

equation of which is
H = 0°270.

In plotting this curve rates of cooling have been taken over three ranges of the kata-
