The most evident way of testing
predictability is to propagate the above distribution with both H, and Ho and calculate the
overlap. In so doing, one would be calculating the classical version of Peres fidelity [11],
(p(x, p; t), po(x, p; t)). Note that, in fact, this is equivalent to propagating the density forward

in time with Ho, reversing the prorogation with H,, and overlapping that with the initial : =
density. Thus for our purposes, the reversibility and predictability time scales are identical and : 5
captured by the same measure, and they are intimately connected with the systemâ€™s sensitivity to : 5
perturbations. 1p

Our interest is in the initial decay as opposed to the long-time asymptotic behaviour, and : EY
both have been studied [29]. A heuristic method of calculating the initial classical fidelity decay : 3
conceptually would be to remain in a reference frame that follows the evolving normal coordinate :B
form [30] of the central trajectory of p9(x, p;t).
