The fact that half our series grew in one field, the other half in another,
that part came from one side of a road, part from another, may introduce an unper-
ceived heterogeneity which increases the apparent homotyposis. Thirdly, the
difficulty of ensuring that all individuals are of the same age or in the same stage
of development, is very great. The leaves of an old tree may have a fictitious
likeness when compared with those of a young tree ; we may gather organs from one
individual when it is in a stage of development, which would only be reached in
another individual some days or weeks later. These and other factors may perhaps
be to some extent eliminated—far better of course by the trained botanist than by


HOMOTYPOSIS IN THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM. 359

the mere mathematician—but I very much doubt the possibility of their complete
elimination. If homotyposis had a practically constant value throughout nature, I
should only expect this value to be ascertained as a result of the average of many
series in which the opposing factors of differentiation, environment, age, stage of
growth, &c., may more or less counteract each other.
