For such a material, the stored-energy function W is a function of J, and J,, given in
terms of the principal extension ratios A,, A, and A, by the relations

For a pure homogeneous deformation of the material, the principal components of the
stress ¢), ¢, and ¢, are given (Rivlin 1948) by

where / is an arbitrary hydrostatic pressure. If the surface tractions on the major surfaces
of the sheet are zero, then ¢, = 0 and equations (4-3) yield, with (4-2),

In the deformation, the initial thickness h of the sheet is changed toA;h. From (4-4), we obtain

Equations (4-5) will apply with sufficient accuracy to the problem defined in § 3, in spite
of the fact that the surface traction on one of the major surfaces is — P, since P is very small
compared with T, and T,,. If the point of the middle surface of the sheet, which is at (p, 0, z) in the deformed state,
is at (7,0, 0) in the undeformed state, so that the undeformed sheet is flat, then we readily
see that
