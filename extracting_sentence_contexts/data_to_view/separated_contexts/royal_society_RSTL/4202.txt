When this is laid open by a
horizontal section (Plate V. fig. 6), it is seen to consist of a series of concentric zones,
the cells of which alternate with each other, like those of the simpler type (q 17.). The cells are nsaally circular (or nearly 80) in form ; but seem to differ consider-
ably in size, even in different parts of the same zone. Their borders, however, very
commonly present a funnel-like aspect; and thus we perceive that the diameter of
the cavity is liable to yary, according to the part of it which the section happens to
traverse,â€”a fact which becomes more obvious when vertical sections are examined ;
for it is then seen (Plate VI. figs. 7, 8, 9) that each columnar cell is narrowed by
constrictions at intervals, s0 as to divide it imperfectly into a series of segments
vertically superposed one upon another.
