for a greater distance immersed in the water, and were intercepted by, and mecha-
nically retained against, the faces of the stones by the action of the stream at the
heads of the pools. Further down, and in tiller water, where no such intercepted
heaps were seen, their buoyancy had, no doubt, by degrees, overcome the cohesion
and raised them to the surface ; and in fact, in the still water, many minute icy frag-
ments were floating in the surface.

Mr. Kwicrr, the celebrated botanist, quoted by M. Araco, has obviously, in part,
but not completely, distinguished between the © frozen matter which reflected a sil-
very kind of whiteness,” which covered the stones in the rocky bed of the river, and
« floating spiculz under water,” which he found to © accumulate much more abun-
dantly upon such parts of the stones as stood opposed to the current, where that was
not yery rapid, below the little falls or very rapid parts of the river.”

In the smaller stream of the Leochal, the quantity of ground-gru was compara-
tively much more abundant, occupying the bottoms both of the pools and rapids in
close masses, and in the latter, at many parts, forming such an impediment as to
