The nature of this acidity has been investigated, has been proved to
be due to citric acid, and is reported in Part XII of this series. ‘These species are
also distinguished by the production of a purple-coloured substance, a methoxy-
dihydroxy-toluquinone, which is also described in Part XII. The remaining
five species give rise to smaller, but still quite considerable, quantities of
titratable acidity and non-volatile acids.

(ii) None of the eight strains produces appreciable amounts of alcohol (“carbon in
volatile neutral compounds”), though, with the exception of Ad. 21, all of them
give rise to detectable amounts. A natural sequence to this is the fact that all
these strains have low respiration coefficients.

(iii) All the strains give moderate amounts of “ carbon unaccounted for.”
