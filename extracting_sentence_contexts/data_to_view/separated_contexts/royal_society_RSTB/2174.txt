The impaired action of the vaso-motor centre
contributes to the fall of pressure, but the coincident slowing of the pulse is due to
an effect within the heart, and to this the fall is mainly due. It occurs when the
vagi are divided, and is not prevented by atropine. Though it might otherwise
simulate a condition of inhibition, these facts point rather to a depression of the
intrinsic motor apparatus, whilst the walls of the heart chambers retain a large
share of their contractile power. In advanced poisoning there is therefore produced
the extraordinary condition of a very slowly acting heart, which seems capable of
continuing its action for hours, whilst the blood pressure amounts to only a few
millimetres of mereury. Beyond this, however, there is a tendency to a block in the passage of certain
impulses from the auricle to the ventricle, whilst the ventricle itself (during one
stage) fails to develop a normal propulsive systole in a comparatively large pro-
portion of its efforts at contraction.
