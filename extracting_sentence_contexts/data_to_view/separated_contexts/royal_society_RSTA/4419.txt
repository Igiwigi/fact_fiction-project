(ii.) The accuracy of a prediction will not be indefinitely increased by increasing
the number of organs upon which the prediction is based. This fundamental fact of
the application of the theory of correlation to prediction has already been noticed by
Miss Anice Lee and myself in the case of barometric prediction.* The choice of
organs upon which to base the prediction is far more important. Thus, to illustrate
this from stature I may remark that the probable error of a prediction of male stature
from radius is to a prediction from femur in the ratio of 2°728 to 2174; that if one
takes both femur and tibia for the prediction, the probable error is only reduced to
2°030, and further, if one takes femur, tibia, humerus, and radius, we only reach
1:961.
