2, B. Now, considering again the forward movement of any
two successive limbs. At the commencement, the hinder limb will touch the front limb
at about the level of the second endite. The distal group of sete of the front limb will
thus lie close against, and, in fact, will be sucked against the flat surface of the basal
endite of the hinder of the two limbs. They cannot, therefore, act to any great extent
as filters, but on the other hand, the proximal group of set project downwards across
an open space and merely separate the median space from the lateral inter-limb space,
fig. 2, A. There is nothing to hinder water passing through them and hence it is through
them that maximum filtration must occur.
