200 grms. narcotine are put into a large flask with 1000 cub. centims. strong hydro-
chloric acid (the pure commercial acid), and are digested together, on a water-bath

under a layer of paraffin at 100* C. Much chloride of methyl is given off, and a thick
oily mass separates out on cooling, and when no further quantity is formed the reaction
may be considered finished®.
'The reaction which takes place may be written thus—
C,, Hz, N O;+2H Cl=C,, Hz, N O,+2CH, Cl. ;
To purify the chloride, and to obtain the base from. it, advantage is taken of the fact
that it is comparatively insoluble in dilute hydrochloric acid, whereas in strong hydro-
chloric acid as well as in pure water it dissolves readily. After the reaction is finighed
the contents of the flask are allowed to. cool.. The liquid portion (strongly acid) is
poured into a large beaker, and the oily mass dissolyed in hot water, allowed to cool,
and then poured into the strongly acid solution. 'This causes a precipitate, and water
or hydrochloric acid is added in case either produce a further precipitate. The preci-
pitated chloride is collected on a filter and washed with dilute hydrochloric acid (1 part
acid, 9 parts water); after washing, the precipitate is dissolved in water, and carbonate of
sodium added in excess, in which the new base is soluble, but nareotine insoluble; after
filtering off any undecomposed narcotine, the solution is carefully neutralized with
hydrochloric acid to precipitate the base, which becomes curdy on heating and may be
filtered and washed with ease. After being well washed it is redissolved in hydro-
