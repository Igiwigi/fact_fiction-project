ance may probably be referred to the same epoch ; butT have
not myself been able to detect either of the families of this
section of trachelipoda in any secondary bed, excepting the
denuded tracts of green sand in Devonshire ; and there, per-
forations exactly similar to those which abound among ter-
tiary and recent shells are also of frequent occurrence,
although I have never met with any such perforation in any
other secondary formation, nor even in any of those regular
beds of green sand, which actually underlie the chalk in other
counties. Tam not enough of a geologist to decide, as to
whether any admixture of secondary and tertiary fossils may
possibly have taken place when these denudations were
made, but I can in no other way account for the fact, that all
the species which have been perforated, as well as the carni-
vorous trachelipodes themselves, are nearly similar to those
of the London clay; and I have never been able to find any

such perforation in either of those species which are found
in the more regular beds of green sand, and which are some-
times mixed with them. These perforations may be readily
distinguished from those more oblique and lateral burrow-
ings which are often found in secondary fossils, and are al]-
