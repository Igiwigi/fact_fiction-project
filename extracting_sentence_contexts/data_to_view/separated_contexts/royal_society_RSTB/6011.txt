Hylide. Witver and Biume recognized that in the Hylide the Anuran larynx exhibits
extreme sexual differentiation, and this not only in size, but in the development in the
male of sesamoid and other minute cartilages, which are absent in the female. The
examples described in this paper further illustrate these facts (in spite of the fact that
male and female of the same species are rarely available for comparison) and show also
that in some species additional fibrous outgrowths of the wall of the larynx into its
cavity may characterize the male, as in Hyla rubra (South America) and in the Australian
Hylas. The Australian Hylas provide a distinct type of larynx. H. cwrulea, H. ewingii and
H. aurea have in common the presence of a broad processus muscularis of the cricoid, and,
in the males, of a paired bulbous prominence of the pulmonary end of the frenulum
chord vocalis.
