cury when determined by this method agrees with REGxXAavu1T's value, yet on account of
this value being large, small errors in the water coefficients will not materially influence
it ; for the yolume of water at

4*=1-0000, at 100*=1-04316,
that of mercury at
0*=1-0000, at 100*=1-01815,
and that of copper, for instance, at
0*=1-00000, at 100*=1004998,
Showing that the expansion of copper is yery small compared with that of water or
mercury.

This fact led me to make another series of check experiments by determining the
linear expansion of a certain copper bar, as described in the first part of my paper above
quoted, and then weighing a piece of it, turned to the shape of a double cone, in water
at different temperatures. Â»

The following are the results obtained with the copper bar; and it may here be men-
tioned that copper does not behave in one respect like glass. 'The glass rods, as there
shown, do not return directly to their original length after being heated to 100? and
cooled rapidly ; copper, however, does 80; for no differences in the coefficients were
observed after heating the rod to 100?, determining its expansion, allowing it to stand
over night, and redetermining the coefficients.
