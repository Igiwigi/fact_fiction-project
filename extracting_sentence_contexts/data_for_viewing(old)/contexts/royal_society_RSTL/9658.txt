lithocyst are regulated only by resistance, it seems almost unaccountable that these
discharges should frequently fail to excite the contiguous area a@ @ @ z, while they
are effectual in exciting the remote area 2 2 2 2; and this even after 2 2 2 2 has been
almost completely severed from x > © & by the severity of the incisions. To my
mind, the facts seem rather to point to the conclusion that the lithoeysb is engaged in
emitting some sorb of continuous ganglionic impulse which spreads throughout the
nervous plexus, and helps to stimulate the ganglionic cells which are scattered
throughout this plexus. And this conclusion is not incompatible with the view that
the resistance which is offered by the plexus is 80 adjusted to the accumulation of
energy by the lithoeyst, that this energy admits of being periodically discharged in
greater amount, just at the time when the contractile tissues have completely recovered
from their exhaustion due to their previous contraction, In s8upport of this interpreta-
tion of the facts, it may be added that after the removal of the lithoeyst I tried the
effects of gently irritating the tissue in the area @ © @ » with a camel-hair pencil,
and I found that by 80 doing I could again excite the origination of contractile waves
from the point 0 in the area 22 2 2.

$4. Regeneration of the excitable tissues of Aurelia aurita.—The only remaining
facts which I have now to communicate have reference to the astonishing rapidity
with which the excitable tissnes of the Medusw regenerate themselves after injury.
In this connexion I have mainly experimented on Aurelia aurita, and shall therefore
now confine my remarks to this one species.

If with a sharp scalpel an incision be made through the tenuous contractile sheet
of the subumbrella of Aurelia, in a marvellously short time the injury is repaired.
