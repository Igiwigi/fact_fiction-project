enamel organ downwards to invest the forming roots of the teeth. This was shown
by him in the teeth of the mouse, rat, dog, and calf. :

The epithelial sheath, according to this author, is an extension of the enamel
organ to form the investment of the forming root of the tooth, and in fact controls
and limits the growth of the dentine. He says, “ Where there is no epithelial sheath
there are no odontoblasts and no dentine formation.”

He showed that MALassxz’s epithelial rests in the periodontal membrane are part
of this sheath, and he was the first author to ascribe a distinct function to this
prolongation of epithelial cells.

The epithelial sheath which passes downwards between the connective tissue fibres
of the periodontal membrane, parallel with the growing root, he figures as continued —
round the root tip in a double layer, forming a loop which terminates opposite a
similar loop from the opposite forming root tip, leaving a space between oceupied by
the growing pulp.
