We began with a Lepidoden-
droid plant, Z. s21aginoides, in which we found the medullary axis largely occupied by
a great number of scalariform vessels ; but we saw that these were not arranged in
radiating order, neither did they give off any vascular bundles to the leaves. These
bundles were confined to the inner surface of a very narrow, but nevertheless distinet,
enclosing circle of somewhat smaller vessels, between which, and passing radially out-
wards, were vertically disposed rows of cells, which I believe to be true representatives
of medullary rays, whilst the thin cylinder through which they pass'is the woody zone
separating medullary from cortical structures. The bark we found to be thick, consisting
of varying elements of parenchyma and prosenchyma, but chiefly the latter ; and near
the outer surface we discovered a layer of prosenchyma, where the cells are 80 elon-

through the bark, being, in fact, an investure of the vascular tissue accompanying the latter to whatever
organism the tubercle helped to snstain. It thus appears that these outer layers of bark, having an aggregate thickness of from three eighths to half an
5 inch, filled up the deep valleys separating the conical hillocks of the Zalonia, and almost reduced the entire sur-
face of the plant, when living, to a uniform leyel. These determinations bring the minute and geometrically
arranged punctations covering the surface of the Halonia into homological relations with similar markings 8een
on other semidecorticated Lepidodendroid plants.
