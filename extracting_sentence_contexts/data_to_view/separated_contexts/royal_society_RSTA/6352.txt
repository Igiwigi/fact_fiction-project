Finally, it was suggested that the linkage between AMOC variability and deep-water formation
could be impacted by wind-driven changes that drive overturning variability. Since the density
field near the basin boundaries sets the overall shear of the basin-wide geostrophic circulation,
wind-forced changes in that density field can modify AMOC strength [30]. In fact, AMOC changes
on seasonal time scales have been linked to wind-forced Ekman pumping near the eastern
boundary of the RAPID array [31] and similar processes involving Rossby wave transmission of
Ekman pumping signals to the western boundary have been implicated on interannual to decadal
time scales [32]. In short, it was recognized that AMOC variability at subpolar latitudes could also
be affected by wind forcing. Thus, while modelling studies had suggested a linkage between LSW formation and AMOC
variability, a review during the OSNAP planning period [33] concluded that no conclusive
observational evidence for a link between dense water formation in the Labrador Sea and AMOC
variability had emerged to date.
