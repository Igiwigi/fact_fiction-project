However, it is well known that solutions can be approximated by means
of a gradient expansion method also known as WKB approximation [30], we write

o=Awxpe’. (2.3)

At first order, the wave can be seen as a coherent collection of rays (see [31] for an elegant
presentation of the method for water waves). The rays are given by a Hamiltonian, which in our
case is given by [27]

H = 5[(w — v9.k? — F(R), (2.4)

where k= VS =(k,,m/r) and w =—9d;,S, with k, being the radial wavevector and m being the
azimuthal number. The amplitude of the wave is calculated by using the fact that the wave action
is transported with the group velocity, vg, along tubes delimited by such rays. More precisely,
in the absence of dissipation and in stationary systems, the amplitude satisfies the transport a
equation: :=

V - (QoAKRVe) =. (2.5) :8

Therefore, we have that :

where 29 = — v9 -k is the co-moving frequency, computed after having solved Hamilton’s ae
equations with the Hamiltonian given in equation (2.4). :3
At fixed m and w, the Hamiltonian function defines a two-dimensional surface parametrized [8
by r and k,. The structure of the Hamiltonian function imposes that this surface admits a saddle ,
point (figure 1).
