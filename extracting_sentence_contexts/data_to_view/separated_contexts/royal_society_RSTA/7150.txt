This fact makes a most welcome simplification of the theory. For the decision whether G?
is a minimum, or not, depends on the expansion of G? by Taylor’s theorem in the variations,
da;, of the m parameters. When the first derivatives vanish, one expects in general to have to
study the quadratic form in m variables involving the second derivatives; and that may be
bothersome.
