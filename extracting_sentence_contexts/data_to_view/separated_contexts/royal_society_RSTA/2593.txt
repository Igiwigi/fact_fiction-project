At a low impact velocity of 0.44ms~! (We =27.24
and Re = 1328), the droplet shows bouncing behaviour. The water droplet bounces back with little
deformation in its shape. This may be due to the fact that the kinetic energy of the water droplet
is less than the surface energy of water. Pinning is observed when the water droplet impacts at a

floating for a longer time on the water surface. (Online version in colour.)
