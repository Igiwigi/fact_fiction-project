We see how, as it were, by filtering out disturbed days we obtain a gradual retarda-
tion in the phase. Some of the Astronomer Royal’s quiet days are decidedly less
quiet than others. Supposing we adopted a still higher standard should we observe
even more retardation? On the other hand, our disturbed days vary much in the
degree of disturbance, and very considerably in its type. Is there an advance in
phase irrespective of the type of disturbance, and is the advance greater in highly
disturbed than in moderately disturbed days? Obviously there are many further
questions arising out of the above result. Evidently a study of the phase constitutes
a method of considerable delicacy for advancing our knowledge of disturbances ; but
a very obvious consideration is that in order to obtain even approximately smooth
diurnal inequalities from highly disturbed days one must deal with a long period of
years. When diurnal inequalities are not smooth, merely “accidental” irregularities
may introduce a fictitious element into the Fourier coefficients, especially those of
shorter period.

The results reached emphasise one difficulty in the way of an exact inter-
comparison of stations. Even if all stations suffered equally from disturbance, their
published data would not be strictly comparable unless the standard for omitting
disturbed days when forming the diurnal inequality were absolutely uniform. Under
existing conditions all that we do know is that the standard is not uniform, and that
there is no obvious way of making it so, whilst there is every reason to believe that
the incidence of disturbance is widely different.

We have already referred to the different effects produced by disturbance in the
angles ~, and a. Possibly this difference may be connected in some way with
