MR. WHEATSTONE ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION. 387

two colours had mingled before their arrival at a single eye, the mind will perceive
the two colours distinetly one or the other alternately predominating either partially
or wholly over the disc. In the same manner the mind perceives no trace of violet
when red is presented to one eye and blue to the other, nor any vestige of orange
when red and yellow are separately presented in a similar manner. These experi-
ments may be conveniently repeated by placing the coloured discs in the stereoscope,
but they have been most usually made by looking at a white object through dif-
ferently coloured glasses, one applied to each eye.

In some authors we find it stated, contrary to fact, that if similar objects of dif-
ferent colour be presented one to each eye, the appearance will be that compounded
of the two colours. Dr. Rz1D* and Janin are among the writers who have fallen
into this inconsiderate error, which arose no doubt from their deciding according to
previous notions, instead of ascertaining by experiment what actually does happen.

No question relating to vision has been s0 much debated as the cause of the single
appearance of objects seen by both eyes. I shall in the present section give a slight
review of the various theories which have been advanced by philosophers to account
for this phenomenon, in order that the remarks I haye to make in the succeeding
section may be properly understood.
