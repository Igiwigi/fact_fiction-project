bladders in fish—used in communication) may increase the predation risk for
the producers [1]. Certain types of vocalizations (such as song) can also be
cognitively demanding [2,3], requiring nutrients and time [4]. Yet, individual
vocal recognition (IVR), which is the ability to recognize an individual from
others owing to distinctive acoustic features, has evolved multiple times across
the animal kingdom and is frequently found in mammals [5,6] and birds [7,8]
and often in amphibians [9].
