pterygoids. Its upper anterior portion is grooved for the lodgement of the inter-orbital
cartilage. The full depth of the median plate cannot be determined, but it is certainly
large. The shaded patches shown in the drawing, fig. 127, Plate 9, which are
drawn from preserved portions of the plate, give a fair idea of its extent. Outer plates
of the vomer clasp the posterior pterygoid plates on their outer sides, as shown in the
section figured (fig. 126, Plate 9).

The pterygoids are almost perfectly preserved. Quite manifestly the pterygoid
forms the back part of the larger outer process, as in all Therocephalians in which the
parts are satisfactorily preserved. Boonsrra (1934) figures the transpalatine as
forming the back of the process in Notosollasia, Theriognathus, and Whaitsia. In the
figures I gave of the palates of Wotosollasia and Whaitsia in 1932, I indicated the ptery-
goids as forming the back of the processes. The fact that the pterygoid certainly
forms the back of the process in Hyenosaurus seems to render it probable that my inter-
pretation of the condition in Whaitsia and Notosollasia is correct. There is no sub-
orbital vacuity. Posteriorly, the pterygoid has a long outer process which extends to
very near the quadrateâ€”possibly articulating with it.

Above the back part of the pterygoid is seen the large epipterygoid. This has a
short, very broad, upper portion, and a long, flat base which extends outwards and
backwards on the top of the outer process of the pterygoid; but it ends a considerable
distance short of the quadrate.

The transpalatine (ectopterygoid) is relatively large. It forms the front of the
outer part of the pterygoid process. It extends well forward on the outer side of the
