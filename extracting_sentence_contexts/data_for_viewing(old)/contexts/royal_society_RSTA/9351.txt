mild carbon and alloy steels. Sretn and Crarint give values of about 1-3 for mild
steel, while results obtained by Hanxins, Hanson and Forpt on heat-treated spring
steels range from 1-27 to 1-77, lying chiefly between 1-4 and 1-6. A similar wide
variation is shown in tests by Harrrenp§ on various steels, values ranging from 1-33
to 1-95 being obtained.

In simple uniform flexure the stress distribution (assuming perfect elasticity) is linear
as in torsion, but every part of the material is in simple tension or compression. It
would be expected therefore that, whatever theory of elastic failure be adopted, such
failure should take place in flexure when the maximum tensile or compressive stress
in the beam reached the value observed at failure in a simple tension or compression
test. The results of flexure tests, however, show stresses substantially greater than
those in tension. This fact has been well known for many years in the case of cast

iron,|| although in this material it may be aseribed, partly at all events, to imperfect

elasticity and to a difference in properties as between tension and compression ; but, as
Unwin has pointed out, { these are insufficient to account completely for the difference.
KENNEDY** appears to have been the first to call attention to the discrepancy in the
case of mild steel. He carried out a number of tests on rectangular beams, applying
both a uniform bending moment and also a central load, and found that the ratio of
the maximum fibre stress in flexure to that in tension at what was taken as the yield
