In practice, complications arise from the apparent variability in the secular change
from year to year, To illustrate the consequences of such irregularity, take the
simple hypothetical case where the secular change of declination proceeds uniformly
from January 1 to December 81 of a year at the rate of 12’ a year, and then proceeds
for the next twelve months at the uniform rate of 6’ a year. From the mean values
for the two years we should deduce a secular change, not of 12! or of 6’, but of 9’ a
year, and if we corrected the two years’ monthly values independently, on the
assumption of a secular change of 9/ a year, we should deduce for each year a wholly
fictitious annual inequality. Combining the monthly values for the two years we
should in this case conclude, rightly enough, that there was no true annual inequality,
but that is merely an accident of the particular hypothesis. The illustration will
show how uncertain is the physical interpretation to be put on an apparent annual
inequality in the case of an element whose secular change is irregular, unless we deal
with mean monthly values from a large number of years.
