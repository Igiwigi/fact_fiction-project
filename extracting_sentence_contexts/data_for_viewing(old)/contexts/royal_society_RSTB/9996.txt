Our goal is to question the assumption that the transition
to very low fertility is irreversible. There are several good
reasons to question the assumption. First, neither the endpoint
of the demographic transition nor fertility behaviour of the
future is predictable with current theory [6]. Without a solid
predictive framework, we cannot know how fertility will
respond to changing social and environmental cues in the
future. Second, life-history theory predicts variability in
demographic traits across conditions, such that we should
not expect fertility to lose the majority of its variation and
go to one value (replacement fertility) over the course of an
uncertain and complex future. Third, many classic approaches
to the demographic transition would in fact predict increases
in fertility levels if socio-economic conditions changed. For
example, Beckerâ€™s well-known human capital argument
would imply a fertility reversal if the cost of children decreas-
ed dramatically or if the returns for investments in human
capital were to disappear or diminish more rapidly [16,17].
The implicit assumption in much of economics and demogra-
phy is that economic development and improvements in
standard of living will continue to increase into the distant
future. For the human capital model, and for many other
approaches to the problem, sustained growth (perhaps
by assumption) is what prevents consideration of a major
fertility reversal, rather than any theoretically grounded
