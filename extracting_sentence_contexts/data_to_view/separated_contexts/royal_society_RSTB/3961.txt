On the diffusion theory the arterial blood would be at a considerably
lower saturation even during rest, and work such as that of cutting steps with an ice-
axe, or climbing, would apparently be wholly impossible. The difficulties of the diffusion theory appear to become greater and greater as the
altitude increases; but in the absence of more definite physiological observations on
mountains at great altitudes we need hardly carry the argument into further detail. Recent advances in knowledge as to the blood-gases and the physiology of respiration
seem, in fact, to have been altogether fatal to the simple diffusion theory hitherto
adopted by the majority of physiologists. The indirect evidence points as clearly to
this conclusion as the direct evidence furnished by our determinations of arterial
oxygen pressure on Pikeâ€™s Peak. Prorocot of an Experiment on the Arterial Oxygen Tension and Blood Volume.
