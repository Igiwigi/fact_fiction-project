clause structure, cartography, predication combination of two distinct and diverse elements, a subject and a predicate,

in the proper configuration. The term ‘composition’ is obviously pervasive in

science for it refers to the generation of a novel structure by assembling smaller

parts but, in fact, the term was originally used in linguistics; etymologically,

composition derives from the Latin translation of the Ancient Greek term

ina sequence." The term ‘configuration’, instead, refers to the fact that syntactic
relations cannot be represented on a single linear dimension despite the fact
that the physical stimulus is indeed linear: they require at least two dimensions
which are normally represented as graphs on a plane (see [2]). This is very easy
to detect but it is often neglected. To illustrate the configurational properties of
syntax, a simple sentence like The war which destroyed these countries was not
unexpected is sufficient. The number features of the singular noun war cannot
be conveyed along the sequence of words to trigger agreement on the verb is;
a second dimension must be introduced, which gives rise to a configuration.
Thus, the question addressed here is whether this compositional notion can
be selectively derived in a configurational way.

Predication constitutes the defining property of clause structures in all (but
only) human languages and is one that has never been dismissed since it was
