combustion (PAC) in hydrocarbon-containing mixtures. Despite the fact that the PAI/PAC topic
has been developing for more than 15 years [1-3], a limited number of experiments is available
for high pressures, typical for combustion environment. Three main discharge configurations are
used for PAI at high pressures: nanosecond spark in a few millimetres gap between two point-
to-point electrodes; transient plasma ignition (TPI) where current is limited by interelectrode
distance and/or pulse duration; and nanosecond surface dielectric barrier discharge (nSDBD)
where current is limited by the presence of a thin dielectric layer between the electrodes. The
first configuration in repetitive mode is called nanosecond repetitive pulsed discharge (NRPD)
and widely studied for sustaining combustion [4]. The difference between a nanosecond spark,
in a single or repetitive mode, and the two last configurations is that in the spark the high
current flows through the single discharge channel. In TPI and SDBD configurations, the current
is limited, so the energy is low compared to spark discharge, but multi-channel configuration of
