Scientific theories are not mere speculation. They are also not the opposite of ‘facts’. Scientific : Ss
theories accommodate a body of well-established facts and are designed to elucidate some [8

explicitly or implicitly, that make it possible to test the theory. The periodic table and the theory of 1s
evolution also share the attribute of having been post-dated by new knowledge that challenged :
their legitimacy, yet they survived by evolving to accommodate the new information.
