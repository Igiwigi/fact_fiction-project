at the 8th stage.

(9), (10), (11), (12) The succeeding wires are now all drawn from No. 8 directly
and do not pass through every intermediate hole; thus No. 10 is not No. 9 drawn
one hole smaller, but is No. 8 reduced at once by a single drawing, and similarly for
the others, except, perhaps, No. 12, which probably passed through stage 9 or 10. These facts relating to the drawing of the last three stages are worthy of notice,
as the results of a number of experiments on these wires show some irregularity in the
progressive change of their physical properties in the final stages, and the method
of drawing in these stages may in part account for the irregularity. 5. The samples illustrating the twelve stages were not long enough to allow the
thickest of them to be made more than 50 diameters long, and this fixed the
dimension ratio for the whole series, but an additional series, from No. 5 upwards,
was cut to a dimension ratio of 100.
