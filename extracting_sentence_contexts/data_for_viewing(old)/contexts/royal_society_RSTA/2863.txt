RDGE: Ice divergence divu (i,j) used to ridge sea ice was changed in convergence and shear
to divu (i,j) * (cl-cl/c3) +divu (i,j) *cl/c3 in the module ice_dyn_evp.F90.

CINE: The northeast replacement pressure variable clne was modified in ice_dyn_evp.F90
as clne=clnex (cl-cl/c3) +clne*cl/c3 immediately after its assignment.

KSNO: Thermal conductivity of snow, ksno, was increased from 0.30-0.303 Wm! K7? in
Icepack, a 1% change constituting a Category III code revision.

Modifications in RDGE and CINE are algebraically synonymous with the CICE6 baseline, but
slightly alter the numerics of the continuity and momentum equations, respectively. The KSNO
case results in a Category III climate change owing to the model’s strong sensitivity to the
thermal conductivity of snow [43]. In fact, we define any parameter change in an existing CICE
configuration as a Category III change that would first be detected during maintenance of the code
repository, rather than by the 2SPT and QSC tests. Nevertheless, KSNO serves as a benchmark
against which RDGE and C1NE may be compared.

We seek to answer three questions using the RDGE-C1NE-KSNO suite: First, are the combined
2SPT and QSC tests sufficiently sensitive to differentiate Category I, II and III code modifications?
Second, is our target 5-year test window sufficiently long for the purpose? Finally, how do the
2SPT and QSC test results from RDGE-C1INE-KSNO compare with other instances where we
know that the 5-year h; climate differs between paired sea-ice simulations? For this last question,
we make use of the simulations from other Consortium models with clear /,; signals. Answers to
each of these questions are summarized in figures 4—6, but the results of RDGE and C1NE were so
similar that we omitted the latter case where appropriate (figures 4 and 6). To answer our second
