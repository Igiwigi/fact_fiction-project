1096 MR. F. W. DYSON ON THE POTENTIAL OF AN ANCHOR RING.

The preceding work exemplifies an interesting fact about vortex motion. When
the configuration of the vortices are known, their various velocities are obtained by
linear equations ; just as in the case of gravitating matter, linear equations give the
accelerations of the various parts.

§ 43. When there are only two rings, the equations of motion are—
