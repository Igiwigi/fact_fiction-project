stem ceased by July 2, the terminal bud having been destroyed. The photograph
cited was taken on July 10. Flowering continued unaffected, just as on normal
plants, until July 23. It then slowed down, but did not stop entirely until
July 30. Only two flowers opened during August, but during the next two months

flowering was not merely resumed, but was abnormally rapid. This does not
particularly concern us, the principal interest resting in the fact that this extremely
unhealthy plant flowered normally for nearly a month, though of course it failed
to retain any of the flowers as ripe bolls.

The details are given in Table LX. The explanation seems simple. The act of
defoliation reduces the water strain, and the expansion of pre-formed organs can
proceed ; but it also reduces the photosynthetic area, and so restricts the growth
of new primordia. Consequently, those flower-buds and internodes of flowering
branches which were fully differentiated as the “ scaffolding” of the plant continue
to develop, and the flowers open in due course. These being all opened, flowering
must stop until new leaves and new scaffolding shall be built up, and a fresh series
of flowers produced.
