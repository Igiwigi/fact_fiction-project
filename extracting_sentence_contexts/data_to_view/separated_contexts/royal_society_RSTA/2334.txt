Attempts were made to test whether the data were inaccurate at low vibration amplitudes by
sorting out the recorded events with the highest standard deviations of the acceleration; however,
no clear indication was found. Similar results were also obtained using the UPC algorithm instead
of the SSI-cov/ref. It is, however, a fact that this is an imperfect axisymmetric problem with
asymmetric mass distribution at the waterline caused by the heavy force panels and varying mass
distribution due to ice rubble. Further, an unknown extent of nonlinearity is involved and the
system identification is handled with only a few sensors. An attempt was also made to investigate
whether the first eigenmode had preferred mode shape alignments in the horizontal plane.
