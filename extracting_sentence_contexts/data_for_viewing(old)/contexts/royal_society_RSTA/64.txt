or a few representative unit cells (RUCs) with a fine mesh. The quality of these mesoscopic meshes
of the RUCs strongly influences the quality of meso analyses [55-57].

To simulate the slippage onsets and developments such as those highlighted above, it is
necessary to perform a meso finite-element simulation of the forming process, i.e. of all the
woven cells in the preform, which means hundreds or thousands of RUCs. Consequently, it

is not possible to use meshes as fine as in analyses carried out on one or a few unit cells.
In fact, to be able to simulate the forming of the whole part, the finite-element model of a woven
cell has to be simple enough while describing the main phenomena at the mesoscopic scale.
Different approaches are developed for the purpose of the simulation of the deformation of a
whole preform with meso finite-element models [58-60].

In this work, each woven unit cell is modelled as a set of shell elements as shown in figure 8a.
This model is very simplified. There are 416 d.f. per unit cell, which enables one to perform the
whole preform forming simulations. Regardless of this simplicity, the main features of the woven
cell behaviour are described. In particular, the contact with friction between the yarns allows
rotation at the crossover of yarns. When the shear angle becomes large, the lateral contact between
yarns increases the in-plane shear stiffness.

The mechanical behaviour of each yarn is those of a fibrous tow. It is described by a hypoelastic
