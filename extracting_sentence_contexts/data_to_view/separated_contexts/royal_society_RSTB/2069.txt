Mont connected the turgor of the guard cells with the assimilative
function of their chloroplasts, and this view is still prevalent, though, as far as
I know, no reason has ever been given for the guard cells behaving differently to
other chlorophyllous tissues. Since the time of Mont our knowledge of the causes

which alter cell-turgor has been greatly increased.* We have cases in which the
production of osmotic material is regulated in a manner of which no direct or
nutritive explanation can be given. Knowledge of this sort may justify us in
expecting that the turgor of the guard cells will be found to be regulated indirectly
like other phenomena of irritability, but this does not permit us to pass over Mout's
theory.
