“From the results of other investigations described and the figures given in the
preceding tables the conclusion seems inevitable that all our principal soil types—
in fact practically all cultivable soils—contain naturally a nutrient solution which
varies within comparatively narrow limits with regard either to composition or
concentration, and which is usually sufficient for plant growth. Apparently, there-
fore, all these soils are amply supplied with the necessary plant foods, and these
plant foods are not in themselves a matter of such paramount importance to the
agriculturist.” *
