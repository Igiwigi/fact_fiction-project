First, that nitrites exert a marked influence both on the colour and the spectrum of
blood, due obviously to a chemical change exerted on the colouring-matter.

that, whatever the nature of the change, it is obviously not one which mates

Secondly,
by mere action of reducing-agents _

all effects of the change disappear ; and

Thirdly, that the fact of reducing-agents developing,
