du(a)=f(a) and Py(a)=2K [Fr - 2] poorer] : (4.1)

The slope of the Hertz-type curve and its derivative are therefore S(a) = dPy/déy = mKa?, S'(a) =
2z Ka. Thus, the explicit formulae (2.19) can be readily written as:

5(a) =f (a) — / * and P(a)=2K [er - a f(r dr — “lz , (4.2)

which is exactly the result derived in [20] using the classical JKR methodology [10].

(b) Two-term asymptotic adhesive solution

In this section, we use the above-mentioned fact that in two-term asymptotic approximation the
thin elastic layer can be formally substituted with the Pasternak elastic foundation. Here we


start from the governing relation between the applied pressure and the displacement of such a
foundation, and represent the derivation of the corresponding JKR adhesive solution in full.

First, let us take into account axial the symmetry of the problem, which allows us to re-write
the governing relation for the Pasternak foundation p(x1, x2) = Kw(x1,x2) — GV2w(x1,X2) as
