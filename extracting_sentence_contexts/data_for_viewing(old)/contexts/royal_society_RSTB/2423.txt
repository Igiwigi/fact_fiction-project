the Hymenophyllacese with other Ferns is summed up by CampseEtt in the following
sentences} :—‘ The Hymenophyllacese, on the whole, approach most nearly the
Gleicheniacee, with which they agree in many points, both in the sporophyte and
the gametophyte, but they also recall the Osmundaceve, and possibly may form a
branch somewhere between the two, but nearer the former. The peculiarities of the
gametophyte are probably in large measure the result of environment, and the
filamentous prothallium of some species of Z'richomanes is beyond question a
secondary and not a primary condition.” This expresses the view which I entertain,

* Sce ‘Annals of Botany,’ vol. 3, Plate 22, fig. 51. In Z'richomanes reniforme the lamina is more robust
than in other species of the genus, it consists of four to six layers of cells. This more massive assimilating
system is seen in the very species which has the largest output of spores per sporangium in the genus.
This appears to me to be a very significant fact, and a definite support of the view that there is a close
casual relation between the filmy character and a lower spore-output in’ certain Osmundacew and in the
Hymenophyllacew.
