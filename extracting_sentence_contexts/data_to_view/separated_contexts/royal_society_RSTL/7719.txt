The line y=0, w=0 gue nodal line would have every point a pinch-point, but being
part of the cuspidal curve, no point thereof is regarded as a pinch-point ; that is, in
regard to this line also we have J=0. And therefore for the entire nodal curve j/=0.

115. ' The cuspidal ninthic curve is a unicursal curve, the equations of which can be
very readily obtained by considering it as the reciprocal of the spinode torse; we 1
fact have

or substituting for X, Y, Z, W their values (=166, 40+16#, 169%, —5 —88—166") and
omitting a common factor 169, we find for the cuspidal curve
@: 9:2: w=30+246 —168 : 248+ 328 : —4—488#: 169%
(values which verify the equation X>+Yy+Zz+Ww=0); the spinode curve being
thus of the order=9 as mentioned. For {=o we have the singular point (y=0, z=0, w=0), (reciprocal of torsal biplane),
