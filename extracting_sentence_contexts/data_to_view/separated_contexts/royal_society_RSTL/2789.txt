The colour of the pencil p 5x produced by the other separating surface G p H
is at all incidences a faint yellowish gray, (which is best scen by turning the
system of prisms upside down; and receiving the ray Rr upon the prism B,
80 that the reflected ray p 87 may not pass through the oil ;) and its intensity
suffers very little change. This fact is a very remarkable one, and arises (as
will be presently seen) from some specific property of the glass itself, When
the lower prism is of the same glass as A, and produces the colours in the pre-
ceding table at different angles of incidence from those of A, the play of colours

* This column is calculated from the formula A = 459 + =, I being the angles of incidence in

the 1st column, A the angles in the -2nd, and m = 1.508 the refractive index of the glass.
