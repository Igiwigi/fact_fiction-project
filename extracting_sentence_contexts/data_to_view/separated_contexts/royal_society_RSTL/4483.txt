The relative strengths will therefore be, —

For the/plates 0% 559% 777 4 149 1000
Double-riveted joint . . . . . 1021
Single-riveted joint . . . . . . 791

From the above, it will be seen that the single-riveted joints have lost one-fifth of
the actual strength of the plates, whilst the double-riveted have retained their resist-
ing powers unimpaired. These are important and convincing proofs of the superior
value of the double joint, and in all cases where strength is required this description
of joint should never be omitted. On referring to the experiments contained in the separate tables, there will be
found a striking coincidence in the facts tending to establish the principle of double
riveting as superior in every respect to the general practice now in use of the single
rivets. It appears, when plates are riveted in this manner, that the strength of the
Joints is to the strength of the plates of equal sections of metal as the numbers,—

1000 : 1021 and 791*. In a former analysis it was 1000 : 933 and 731,

which gives us a mean of 1000 : 977 and 761

which in practice we may safely assume as the correct value of each.
