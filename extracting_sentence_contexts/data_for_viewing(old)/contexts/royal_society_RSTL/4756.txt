2835. Perhaps I ought not to have called the condition of concentration or expan-
sion of the lines of magnetic force in the bodies acting as conductors, a polarity ;
inasmuch as true magnetic polarity depends essentially and entirely on the direction
of the line of force, and not on any mere compression or divergence of these lines.
I have done s0 only that I might point with the more facility to facts and views that
have heretofore been associated with some supposed polarity in the bodies which,
whether paramagnetic or diamagnetic, I have been considering as mere conductors,
and I hope that no mistake of my meaning will arise in consequence. I have already
asked for such liberty in the use of phrases (lines of force, conducting power, &C.)
(2149. 2797.) as may, for the time, set me free from the bondage of preconceived
notions; these are, for that very reason, exceedingly useful, provided they are for the
time sufficiently restricted in their meaning, and do not admit of any hurtful Joose-
ness or inaccuracy in the representation of facts.

þ iii. Magnecrystallic conduction*.

2836. The beautiful researches of PLicker in relation to magneoptic phenomena
cannot have been forgotten, and I hope that my own experiments on magneerystallic
results (2454, &c.) are remembered in conjunction with his ; the phenomena described
by us are, as I believe, due to a common canse, and are the same in kind; and as far
as they are presented by pure transparent bodies, are I think brought by PLicker into

* I must refer here to the important paper by MM. Txxvarr and H. Kxopravcn on this subject in the
Philosophical Magazine, 1850, vol. xxxvii. p. 1. M. F.—January 6, 1851,
