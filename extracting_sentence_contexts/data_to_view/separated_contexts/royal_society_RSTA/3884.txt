This result could be different in the presence of excess particulate Fe when
acidification increases the dissolved Fe concentration [4]. The correspondence observed so far between ASV measurements and biological uptake rates
raises hope that we may be able to quantify experimentally the effects of acidification on the
bioavailability of some trace metals without a detailed knowledge of the chemical identity of
the many organic ligands that may be complexing those metals at a given time and place. In


fact, as previously discussed, ASV titrations can quantify the bioavailable concentration of a trace
metal M", including the free and weakly complexed species, without even revealing the presence
of the weak complexes [20]. One issue is the correspondence between the bioavailability and
the electrochemical lability of metals in the presence of dissolved organic matter that exhibits a
continuous range—often a bimodal distribution—of affinities for trace metals. Additional field
experiments, comparing ASV-labile concentrations of Zn, Cd and Cu to uptake rates by model
organisms and ambient populations, will be necessary to generalize the validity of the approach.
