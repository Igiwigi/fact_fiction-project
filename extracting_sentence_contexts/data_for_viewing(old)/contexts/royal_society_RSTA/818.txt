Since o*(Si) © 60*(Ge) it follows that the dendrite tip radius of germanium is almost three times
larger than the dendrite tip radius of silicon. This explains why the dendrite growth velocity of Ge
is systematically smaller than the dendrite growth velocity of Si, cf. figure 3. It can be understood
by the fact that a fat dendrite propagates more slowly than a thin dendrite [43]. According to
solvability theory, the stability parameter o* is correlated to the anisotropy ¢ of the solid—liquid
interfacial energy as o*(e) « e7/* in the case of fourfold symmetry. In the case of sixfold symmetry,
o*(e) x 7/6 [44]. It follows that ¢(Ge)/«(Si) © 1/3. This may also explain that the transition from
faceted to dendrite growth is observed at a smaller undercooling for Si compared with Ge. A
larger anisotropy may lead to the observation that a planar interface of germanium is still stable
at higher undercoolings. In the case of silicon, the transition from faceted to dendrite growth is,
therefore, observed at smaller undercoolings.

5. Summary and conclusion

We have studied the crystal growth behaviour of pure silicon and germanium and Si-Ge alloys
of various concentrations far away from equilibrium. Sphere-like samples of about 10mm in
