The ratios of the table must not be regarded as estimates of parameters which have
definite fixed values for the type of sequence in question. In part the actual values of the
ratio will depend on the range and values of d included in their calculation, in part on the
properties of the particular sequence chosen for analysis. Thus, for example, the low value
of o[H,]/vL Hj] for air temperature is due to the fact that the period covered was deliberately
chosen to illustrate the case in which end-corrections would be of little or no value, whereas
in the case of the soil temperatures the period was deliberately chosen so as to give maximum
chance of improvement with end-corrections. Nevertheless, in spite of these qualifications, a number of general conclusions emerge from
the table, which may be summarized as follows.

(a) End-corrections, v|H,|/v[H,;]. The importance of end-corrections is apparent.
