Subsequent experi-
ments have, however, convinced me that this opinion was erroneous, and have rendered
it necessary to modify considerably the conclusions deduced from those experiments.

2. At the time that that paper was written, I believed that the photographic effects
produced by the electric spectra of all the metals furnished results in a great degree
smilar to each other, if not actually identical. This, it will be seen from subsequent
statements, is correct 80 far as the fact of the similarity in this portion of the spectra is
concerned, but is erroneous as regards the general conclusion deduced from it. During
the past winter I have renewed these experiments, substituting a quartz-train for glass
and bisulphide of carbon, and have chiefly used a fine quartz prism, kindly lent to me by
my friend Mr. Gas81or.
