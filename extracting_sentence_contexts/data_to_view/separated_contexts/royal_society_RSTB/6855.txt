The bracts are succeeded by a whorl of 12-14 microsporophylls which arched over and
protected the gynoecium in bud. The gynoecium is of normal Bennettitalean structure,
but the axis projects above the seeds to form a characteristically moulded body, the
‘corona’, against which the tips of the microsporophylls pressed in bud. Comment is made later on the fact that nearly all the flowers are immature.
