Given a hybrid system we would like to analyse, there may be several valid decompositions
into constituent systems, depending on the focus of our study. This is especially true when highly
engineered substrates are being used, such as various engineered nanoparticle structures, or
electrical-chemical composites, where the engineered physical system is not as well characterized
as is the ‘pure’ system. Further research is required to understand the relationship between
different possible decompositions.

(c) Future of heterotic computing

All of our examples in §4 consist of a substrate with interesting computational potential combined
with a classical control layer provided by a conventional digital computer. One potential
exception is in quantum computing with ancilla-mediated quantum gates (§7), although there
are classical controls of one form or another required for most versions of this model. In fact, it is
not clear that quantum computing without any classical component is possible if ‘whole system’
analysis is performed.

Stepney et al. [38] have proposed a heterotic system combining optical, bacterial and chemical
computing as a proof-of-concept exploration of the very different time scales in these systems,
but with direct interfaces that do not require a classical computer to mediate.

As we have sought to demonstrate with our examples and discussion, most of our current
computing is in fact heterotic. Acknowledging this, and developing the theory to go along with
the practice, will enable future computation to be better understood and hence more reliable,
more efficient in both computational power and resource requirements, and better adapted to its
purpose in a myriad of settings.
