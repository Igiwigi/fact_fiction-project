(45) The effect of chromatic aberration

The fact that a change in the diameter of pupil, when retinal illumination is kept constant,
has so small an effect, appears to dispose of the hypothesis previously suggested by the
author (1944a), namely, that chromatic aberration plays a part in arresting the loss of colour
in the case of a grating of yellow and blue lines. This may be explained as follows. It was
found by experiment that the brightest rays of the spectrum, namely, the yellow and green
rays, normally produce sharply focused images on the retina. In consequence of this, rays
of longer wave-length come to a focus behind the retina, and rays of shorter wave-length
focus in front of it. When a grating consisting of yellow and blue bars is under examination,
then, as stated above, the yellow rays focus sharply on the retina, while the rays from the
blue bars, having come to a focus in front of the retina, spread out to form diffusion circles
on the retina, the diameters of which vary with the aperture of the pupil. They therefore
overlap on to areas of the retina occupied by the sharply focused yellow rays. But blue
and yellow are complementary in colour and, therefore, this superposition causes the pro-
