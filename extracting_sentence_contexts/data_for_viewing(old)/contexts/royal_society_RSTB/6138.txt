Leptodactylid as against a Hylid larynx. Among the Brevicipitide, the members of
the “ Gastrophryne-group ” (see below, p. 519) are distinguished from the Leptodactylide
by the constant presence of a characteristic thickening of the hyoid plate between the
postero-medial processes, and by the mode of attachment of the hyoid muscles, Hemisus
differs from the Leptodactylide: (and resembles the Ranidze) in the presence of an apical
cartilage of the arytenoid, and this is also true of Breviceps adspersus.

Hylide.

Witver and Biume recognized that in the Hylide the Anuran larynx exhibits
extreme sexual differentiation, and this not only in size, but in the development in the
male of sesamoid and other minute cartilages, which are absent in the female. The
examples described in this paper further illustrate these facts (in spite of the fact that
male and female of the same species are rarely available for comparison) and show also
that in some species additional fibrous outgrowths of the wall of the larynx into its
cavity may characterize the male, as in Hyla rubra (South America) and in the Australian
Hylas.

The Australian Hylas provide a distinct type of larynx. H. cwrulea, H. ewingii and
H. aurea have in common the presence of a broad processus muscularis of the cricoid, and,
in the males, of a paired bulbous prominence of the pulmonary end of the frenulum
chord vocalis. In the remaining Anura a bulbous prominence of this type is known
only in Dendrophryniscus stelzneri, a Brachycephalid, an example of convergence.
Apparently, however, it is also present in the Hylid Phyllomedusa moschata, in which
Brome described a spherical procartilaginous mass that he took to represent the
