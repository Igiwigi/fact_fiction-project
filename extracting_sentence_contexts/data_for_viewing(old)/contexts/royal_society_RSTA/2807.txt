question for understanding the history of our own planet, but also the more general question
of what factors allow for the development of plate tectonics on any rocky planet. The Earth
is the only rocky planet or moon known to operate in a plate-tectonic regime; the other rocky
bodies in the solar system are thought to operate in some form of stagnant lid regime (e.g. [13]).
Interestingly, the icy satellite Europa potentially exhibits subduction, and possibly even full-
fledged plate tectonics, in its outer icy shell [14]. However, more work is needed to determine
whether potential subduction zones are spatially limited, akin to Venus as discussed below, or
more widespread. In the stagnant lid regime, the surface exists as a single plate with mantle
convection taking place beneath this plate, and there is no global network of subduction zones
and mid-ocean ridges, or large-scale differential movement between different regions of the
lithosphere (e.g. [15,16]). Stagnant lid planets or satellites can still display volcanism and active
tectonics, as seen on Mars (e.g. [17,18]), Mercury (e.g. [19]) or Io (e.g. [20,21]). In fact, Venus even
shows evidence for limited subduction in some regions, possibly due to burial of the lithosphere
by volcanism, and subsequent ‘peeling’ away and sinking of this buried lithosphere (e.g. [22,23]),
a process called ‘plume-induced’ subduction [24]. However, all of these planets and satellites
clearly lack the global system of mobile plates and plate boundaries that characterizes plate
tectonics on the Earth.

Plate tectonics is also thought to play an important role in Earth’s ability to maintain a surface
environment suitable for life (e.g. [25,26]). Plate tectonics helps power the geodynamo through
efficient cooling of the mantle and core [27,28], and the resulting magnetic field helps to shield
the planet from harmful radiation (e.g. [29]). Moreover, plate tectonics facilitates carbon cycling
between the surface and interior, which helps to maintain temperate surface temperatures on
Earth, thanks to a feedback between climate, silicate weathering, orogeny and volcanism [30-36].
