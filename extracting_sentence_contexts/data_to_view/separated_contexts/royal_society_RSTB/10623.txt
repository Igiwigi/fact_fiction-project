While this appears to be the case for NMDAR-dependent
LTD, mGluR-dependent LTD appears to be a process that is
not simply a reversal of LTP [37]. Heterosynaptic LTD occurs to ‘unstimulated’ inputs when
other inputs are strongly stimulated [36]. It was originally
thought that the unstimulated inputs that become weaker
do so in the absence of synaptic input, but a careful study
of heterosynaptic LTD in the dentate gyrus, the hippocampal
region where heterosynaptic LTD has been most successfully
studied, showed that spontaneous presynaptic activity is, in
fact, required [38]. By contrast, a study of LTD in layer 2/3
pyramidal cells induced heterosynaptic LTD in the slice,
where spontaneous input is unlikely [39]. The authors
argued that this form of LTD has a role in preventing run-
away synaptic modifications in the network and thus may
be a form of homeostatic control [40].

(e) Distance-dependent scaling

In the original description of this phenomenon [41], it was
shown that miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents
(mEPSCs) evoked by local sucrose application in the distal
primary dendrite of CA1 stratum radiatum are more than two-
fold larger than those generated in the proximal dendrite.
