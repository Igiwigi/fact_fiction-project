This defect I compare with the slit R in the imperfectly-
closed tympanum of Hafteria and other Saurians (figs. 11, 12). Embryological
development shows that the ossicular chain in Birds is originally placed closely against
the hinder wall of the tympanic canal, and that it gradually severs itself from the
latter, becomes free, and is then placed inside the tympanic canal. Consequently no
pre-tympanic element like the quadrate can form part of the ossicular chain, unless

* Avrecut (with Dovernoy, TIEDEMANN, PLarNer, and Korsruin) thinks that the Mammalian quadrate
is fused with the squamosal, and is, in fact, the “ processus zygomaticus.” As proof of this hypothesis,
he takes the highly pathological skull of a new-born child, in which the left zygomatic portion is partly
separated by a suture from the rest of the squamosal. Dvuvernoy mentions the same in a Hydrocheerus
according to Baur. The latter found the same on the right side of a still-born Tiger fetus, He refers
also to Corn’s remark upon the quadrate of the Permian Theromorphic Clepsydra, “. . , this hori-
zontal ramus of the quadrate is nothing more than the zygomatic process of the squamosal bone of the )
Mammalia, forming with the malar bone the zygomatic arch.” This may well be the case.
