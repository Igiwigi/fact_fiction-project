CALAMITES (CALAMOCLADUS SECTION). 57

of these older twigs is seen in § 900 (Plate 3, fig. 2), which is cut just above a node.
The xylem here appears to form a hollow cylinder four cells thick, with four medullary
rays marking out the original bundles. Some of the cells are very regularly arranged,
but others are oblique owing to proximity to the node. A leaf-trace bundle is seen
on one side, The phloem in this and the succeeding slide is not clearly differen-
tiated, but seems to be composed of very thin-walled cells. A similar stage is well
shown in Plate 3, fig. 3 (slide H 1b), which is cut just above a node. The stems in
this stage are only about 1 mm. in diameter. It will be noticed that they differ from
adult stems in the small size of the medullary rays and in the absence of carinal canals.
It has been suggested that some stems of this type were really the peduncles of cones,
Apart from the fact that they are much more slender than the axes of the Calamo-
stachys cones present in the same slide, there is little evidence for or against this
hypothesis. A still larger twig is seen in R 945 (Plate 8, fig. 4). This is nearly
2 mm. in diameter, and is surrounded by several small leafy shoots, as though they
had been produced as a whorl of branches from it. There is a large pith-cavity in the
centre, and this is surrounded by xylem, which is now definitely split up into bundles —
by the broadening medullary rays. It seems that in some places secondary rays were
being formed, but the structure is not very clear. There are no obvious carinal canals,
but below some of the xylem groups occur small cavities, caused by the disintegration
of the tissue. These may, perhaps, represent the beginning of the canals. The
phloem, again, can scarcely be distinguished, but is probably represented by a small
number of thin-walled cells external to the xylem, which are badly preserved. Here,
as in many other fossil plants, the identification of this tissue is a point of consider-
