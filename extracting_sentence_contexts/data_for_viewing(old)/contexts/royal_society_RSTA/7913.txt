vapour, and, as will be described, the use of effective traps ultimately eliminated this
effect.

(d) The cleanliness of the surface. Any trace of grease, such as is left by the
evaporation of ordinary water from a glass surface, produces irregularities of colour,
and when the film is heated it tends to break up at the contaminated points, no
doubt owing to evaporation of the impurity.

(e) The distance between the electrodes, particularly in relation to the size of the
dark space. If the film was placed too close, say within a millimetre or two of
the edge of the dark space, the colour and thickness were not uniform. The edges, for
instance, were thicker, no doubt owing to space variations of the electric field,
consequent on the fact that the limit of the dark space was not plane.

(f) The residual gases. Hydrocarbons have a pernicious effect. For instance,
a silver film produced with a silver cathode when the residual air was contaminated

with hydrocarbon vapours was brownish in colour, instead of purple, and behaved
anemalously when heated.
