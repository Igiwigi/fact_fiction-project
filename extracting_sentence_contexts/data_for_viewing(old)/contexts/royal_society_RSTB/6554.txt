In cross-section the maxilla (fig. 13, mx.) is roughly a four-sided structure. The
outer side is convex, the ventral side is straight, and the inner side, which is also
straight, is strengthened by a sclerite gradually increasing in breadth towards the
posterior end. The dorsal side is concave with its concavity becoming deeper and
broader from the anterior to the posterior end.

A strongly developed strand-like apodeme (figs. 7, 8, m.a.) is attached to the
inner surface of the proximal portion of the cardo. Proximally it is hollow (fig. 14,
m.a.), showing that it is formed by an invagination. It gives support to the main
muscles of the maxilla. PrRFILjew’s statement (1926, p. 106), “‘ Die Chitinstrange
nehmen am Lobus internus ihren Anfang ’’, is based on the wrong interpretation of
facts. It appears that he thought the internal sclerite of the cardo and stipes and
the maxillary apodeme one continuous structure. Hicks (1930, p. 582) has wrongly
called the maxillary apodeme the stipes.

The labium (figs. 8, 9) lies between the maxillae. On account of the position of
the single-segmented labial palps (/.p.) and the position of the labial suture, it
appears that the portion called the labium by Sixes (1930, p. 249) and others is
really the prelabium and that the postlabium, as mentioned before, has become
completely fused with the ventral wall of the cranium. The cone-shaped portion
in front of the labial palps is the true ligula (/.) and the portion behind them is the
prementum (pm.). The single-segmented palp is nearly as broad as long and bears
two blunt lobe-like sensory processes, which are lateral in position, and two long
sensory bristles which are anterior and posterior in position. The ligula tapers
