are collinear.

2. The three collinear inflexions with their tangents amount to eight conditions ;
thus any one of the nine points K completes the determination of the cubic ; conse-
quently the two points /, x, must be determinable from K* ; as a matter of fact they
present themselves as the foci of a certain involution.

(a.) k, « are harmonic with regard to OG. One of the four poles of the line (I)
(fig. 1) with regard to the cubic is O; hence, estimating on the transversal h,
we have

Now consider the triangle GG,G;; OG, i.e. h, meets GG, in K, &ec:, and K,K,
meets GG, in I, &e., therefore the line (I) is the polar of O with regard to this
triangle. Hence, again estimating on the transversal h,
