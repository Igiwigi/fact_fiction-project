DOUBLE GAMMA FUNCTION, 363

Integral Formule. § 70. In the general theory of multiple gamma functions the fundamental integral
formula expresses the fact that the integral of the n-ple gamma function can be
expressed in terms of (n+ 1)-ple gamma functions of specialised parameters. As we
have not yet defined the treble gamma function, we cannot prove this theorem for the

ease when 2 = 2. Inthe case when = 1, this proposition reduces to ALEXEIEWSKY’S
theorem (‘Theory of the G Funetion,” § 13).
