There are certain
sounds in the different languages which admit of being appreciated and consequently
of being written down in slightly different manners. Even all the natives of a given
locality do not pronounce words in precisely the same way and there are some sounds
which are particularly obscure or variable. In some instances there is a further
ambiguity due to the fact that the names may have been recorded or transmitted by
an interpreter from another area who may have unconsciously slightly altered the
sounds, or even possibly in a few cases may have given a wrong name. In order to facilitate reference I have here retained in the main the geographical
order which I have adopted in the descriptive sections of this memoir. Most of the
native terms have already appeared in their appropriate places, but others have been
added so as to make the enumeration as complete as is practicable.
