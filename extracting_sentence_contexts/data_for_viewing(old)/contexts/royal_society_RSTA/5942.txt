Figure 11. Comparison of liquidity, the mean wealth transferred per interaction, as a function of time for the group of untrained
(top curve) and trained (bottom curve) agents. This second group has a smaller liquidity value for all t. (Online version in colour.)

Finally, figure 11 shows the liquidity L(f), as defined in equation (2.2), for the groups of trained
and untrained agents.

As it can be seen, trained agents have always a lower liquidity value. This is due to the fact
that they choose not to interact when their wealth is sufficiently low. This result makes it clear that
even though the mechanism of tax redistribution is very effective at lowering the Gini index of
the system, when considering just non-rational agents, it does not motivate the agents to interact
and participate in transactions. The consequence is a stalled economy and higher inequality. For
example, when considering 10% of trained agents, the Gini index falls to 0.1. In the limit case
when all agents are trained inequality is bigger, the Gini index goes up just to 0.18.

4. Conclusion

Economic inequalities are continuously increasing all over the world, except for a few countries.
The ideal unregulated free market that seems fair because it gives everyone the same
opportunities, is not. It is an illusion that fails because of the multiplicative factor, which increases
