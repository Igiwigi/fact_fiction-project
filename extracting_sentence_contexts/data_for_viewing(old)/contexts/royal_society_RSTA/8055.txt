both super-contraction and permanent set are associated, not with the «-keratin of the normal
unstretched hair fibre, but with the transformation of «-keratin into B-keratin by the act of
stretching beyond the Hooxx’s law region ; while the correspondence between the super-

contraction curves, the permanent set curves, and the restricted load/extension curves
affords still another powerful argument in favour of the three-phase theory put forward
above. Horizontal lines have been drawn in the figure to mark the effective boundaries
between the three phases (at roughly 20%, and 45%, extension, ¢f. fig. 9), and it will be
seen that there can be no doubt that the existence of these phases is one of the basic
facts in the study of hair structure.
