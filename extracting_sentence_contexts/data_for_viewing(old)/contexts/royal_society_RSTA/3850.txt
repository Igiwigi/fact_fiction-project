lasers [50,58-64] (see figure 9), where both scalar and vector superpositions of OAM have
been reported (predominantly of a vector nature from waveguide solutions), and more recently
VECSEL lasers [65,66].

A major advance towards integrated OAM solutions was the demonstration of miniature
(micrometre-scale) optical vortex emitters on a silicon waveguide device, able to produce high
OAM into free-space beams with well-controlled amounts of OAM [67]. The team exploited the
fact that whispering gallery modes (WGMs) can carry high OAM, which they then extracted into
free-space emission by fabricating embedded angular grating structures into the WGM resonator
with a periodic modulation of refractive index in the azimuthal direction. An artist’s impression of
this is shown in figure 10. Since this seminal work, several integrated sources have been proposed
and demonstrated [68-77].

Despite these many advances, there remain many exciting prospects for the future. Organic
lasers are an emerging research field, with the first vector vortex mode from such a laser
reported [78]. In this work, an organic semiconductor gain medium was used to form a microdisc
