that ¢,=7. It will be shown that a subnormal form satisfying the equation certainly
exists if a," + 0 with k =n.

We know from the foregoing investigation that @',, is given as the root of an
equation of degree 7, and that, if the roots of this equation are all different, no more
conditions than those just mentioned as satisfied are necessary to ensure the existence
of the subnormal solution. But in this case the equation for 6", is particularly easy
to construct. We have, in fact,
