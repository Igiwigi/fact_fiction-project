media; a model in which the reflexion coefficient of medium 2 is always | 1 is therefore of
particular interest in that it represents a situation where these conditions are completely
violated. Thirdly, the analysis is somewhat complicated and may be more easily followed by
starting with the special case which furnishes some relatively compact formulae and a
straightforward physical interpretation.

The problem illustrated in figure 3 has so far been regarded as a generalization of that of
propagation over a homogeneous earth. It may also be thought of as a generalization of the
famous problem, likewise first solved by Sommerfeld (1896), of diffraction by a perfectly
conducting half-plane, to which it would revert if medium 1 were free-space; and from this
point of view the recovery effect appears perhaps less remarkable than might otherwise be
supposed. In the present case, however, the features commonly associated with diffraction
are obscured by the fact that both the line-source and point of observation are very near the

earth’s surface, and this rules out the possibility of using any simple approximation of the
Huygens-Kirchhoff type. On the other hand, as described below, an exact method of
solution is available in which it is convenient to preserve the concepts of a ‘geometrical
optics’ field and a ‘diffraction’ field. In figure 4, 7” is the image of Tin the earth’s surface,
