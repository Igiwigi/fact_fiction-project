locust, the K, conductance profile follows a circadian rhythm
induced by serotonin modulation, with a sustained conduct-
ance dominating during the day and a transient conductance
during the night [71]. In flies, the Shab delayed-rectifier is up-
regulated by light through PIP2 hydrolysis [80], and serotonin
modulates the voltage-dependence of Shab and Shaker
conductances [72]. However, fly and locust studies give a sim-
plified view on the relationship between the circadian activity
and expressed Ky conductances, as shown by Frolov ef al.
[73]. Their comparative study of 15 species showed that while
the fast flying diurnal insects as a rule express a dominant sus-
tained K, conductance, the nocturnal or crepuscular species
may in fact express either a sustained, or both sustained and
transient, conductance. Moreover, the transient K, conduct-
ances in the nocturnal species do not seem to be active at the
physiological voltage levels of light responses, leaving open
the question about the significance of such conductances to
photoreceptor function. Typecasting insects to specific circa-
dian lifestyles based on K,, conductances is thus difficult, and
more comparative studies are needed in order to make sense
of the K, channel palette in insect photoreceptors.
