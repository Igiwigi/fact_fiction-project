(6.4) Consider now CNT3. If R is non-contextual, there is a non-negative x such that Mx = p*,
and

CNT3 =1-xâ€”-1=0.

There seems to be no way to extend it to a non-contextuality measure without modifying its logic.

7. Contextual fraction

7.1 We discuss next the measure called contextual fraction (CNTF) [3,6] (see also [4,5]). It has
been formulated for consistently connected systems only, and its CbD-based generalization is not
unique. We will consider one such generalization, obtained by treating multimaximal couplings
of connections as if they were additional bunches. This can in fact be used to formally redefine
every system into a consistently connected one, as proposed by Amaral et al. [29].4 We prefer,
however, to simply complement bunch probabilities with connection probabilities rather than
redefining the system itself.

7.2 Unlike the three measures considered above, however, CNTF requires that we deal with
complete vectors of probability p,.), as defined in (3.5), rather than reduced vectors. We need to
accordingly replace the Boolean matrix M with the Boolean matrix Mi.) such that the system R
represented by Pl) is non-contextual if and only if

MQx= Pi), (7.1)

with x defined as above. The structure of M(. is described in [21], and its summary is as follows.
