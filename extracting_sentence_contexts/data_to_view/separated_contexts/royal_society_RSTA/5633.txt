In fact, TN represent microscopically the local Hilbert spaces and at
the same time are tailored on a real-space wave function representation, so they can be used to
describe real-space locality and local symmetries altogether [32-35]. As previously mentioned, TN is naturally free from the sign problem [36]. In fact, for one-
dimensional systems a number of successful studies have demonstrated the power of TN for
HEP problems [37-39] and lattice gauge theory calculations [40-46]. In particular, it has been
shown that TN provide accurate determinations of mass spectra and that they can map out
a broad temperature region. They can also treat chemical potentials and topological terms
and they have been used to study realtime dynamics [43,47,48].
