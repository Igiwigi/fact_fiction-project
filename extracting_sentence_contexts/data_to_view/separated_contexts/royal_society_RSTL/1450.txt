According to this observation, the watch shewed twelve
minutes by the motion of the hands in one hour of mean time, which corresponds to
an interval of 12 seconds of time, shewn by the watch in 60 seconds, or one minute of
mean time. According to the calculation, 33 seconds of time are shewn by the
watch in one minute. A nearer agreement between the theory and matter of fact could
scarcely be expected in the circumstances of the experiment,
