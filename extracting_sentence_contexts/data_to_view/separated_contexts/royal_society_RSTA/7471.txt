This was also done on a National machine using
the method described by Comrie (1936, p. 104; 1932, p. 538). A second subtabulation in
the o direction was then performed in order to produce a final table to four decimal
places at interval 0-01 in |p|. Five decimals were kept throughout up to the final stage of
subtabulation, together with the requisite number of fictitious figures necessary to produce
an exact check at the pivotal values.

5. APPLICATIONS

Since the earliest occurrence of Fresnel integrals in classical diffraction theory a number
of other applications have arisen. A notable group of problems involving functions like (5)
with, in general, complex values of p, is that for which wave propagation takes place over
the surface of separation of different media.
