directly with the strength of the current ; also fluids containing different chemical
substances, especially alkaline substances like sodium hydrate and sodium carbonate,
which according to BiEDERMANN* increase most markedly the excitability of the
â€” sfriated muscular tissue, produce when supplied to the apex more or less rhythmical
contractions. Further, nutritive fluids alone, such as the blood of the animal itself,
canse the same effect, provided that in addition a certain pressure exists within the
apex cavity ; and the effect of this distension of the walls by pressure, which is the
esxential point in this method of producing rhythmical apex contractions, may fairly
be classed as a continuous mechanical stimulation. Here, also, according to LUDw1G
Sand LocnsNGER,? the rapidity of the rhythm varies directly with the extent of this
QA pressure.
Z The facts which have just been urged show that the ventricular musecle has the
E power of summing up the effects of two, three, or more impulses 80 as to produce a
= contraction though each of those impulses is inefficient of itself to cause the muscle
Sto contract. In the same way it is possible to conceive that the muscle should be able
Sto sum up the effects of a series of stimuli which follow one another 80 closely as to
Zdegerve the title of a continuous rather than a discontinuous stimulation. Tf, then, we
:Z2 have reason to snppose that in the firs+ case the discontinuons stimuli ultimately
23 produce a contraction by increasing the excitability of the mnscle, s0 in the second
ZCase We May SUPPOSE that a continuous stimulation causes a rhythmical series of con-
'S fractions by acting in the same way. The difference between the two cases would
Zeconsisb in the extent to which the excitability was increased ; in the one, the muscle
Sis not rendered sufficiently excitable to contract without the assistance of a distinct
Z separate stimulus ; in the other, the excitability is increased 80 much that no separate
