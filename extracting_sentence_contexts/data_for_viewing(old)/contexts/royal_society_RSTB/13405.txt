lor example, Muller [1, p. 483]: ‘Moreover, the ‘degenerative’
changes in these cases could be much more extensive than in cases
of balanced lethals, because the Y and W chromosomes were more
completely protected by their homologues from the action of selec-
tion. This is because their homologues (X and Z, respectively)
themselves remained quite normal, owing to the fact that they were
subjected to selection when in the homozygous sex (XX or ZZ).

Recessive changes could consequently be established in any locus
of Y and W, whereas in cases of balanced lethals, where both homol-
ogues might become involved, only half of either chromosome might,
on the average, degenerate. (...)’; p. 485: ‘after an extensive degener-
ation has taken place in either member of a pair of balanced
chromosomes, many recessive changes in the other member will be
able to ‘show’, just as recessive mutants in the X chromosome can
now manifest themselves in the XY male, owing to the ‘degenerate’
condition of the Y’.
