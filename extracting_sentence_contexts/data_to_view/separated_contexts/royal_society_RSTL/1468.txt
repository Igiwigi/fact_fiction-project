The point Q is placed exactly under
the centre- of the screw A. This point Q is to be considered as the point C, fig. 1. For although in fact the part of the rod HK where the screw
A passes, and rests upon the end of the rod HK, be the point
C,tig. 1; yet if a part of the tube I I, fig. g, at the point C be
taken at an-equal height with Q, fig. 4, as they are both of brass,
both will expand equally. If the whole should be heated, the
expansion of CH, fig. g, will raise up the bar HK, and the ex-

pansion of the screw A, and the frame EF, will carry down
the point Q, so that it shall always be at an equal height with
the point C, fig. 3, The points C and Q, fig. g, 4, therefore,
being always of the same height, may be considered as the
points B C, fig. 1.
