In the section of this paper on the effect of hydrogen on the resistance
of the wire it is shown that heating in air diminishes the resistance at the same time
that it destroys the leak. This seems to show that the surface layers of the wire
contain hydrogen which is burnt up by the air. The fact that platinum black absorbs
very much more hydrogen than solid platinum also points to the conclusion that the
-absorption is mainly a surface effect. The presence of hydrogen in a wire can be
tested by heating it in oxygen and observing the pressure before and after heating. If hydrogen is present it will form water which will be absorbed by the P,O;, and so
the pressure will be diminished.
