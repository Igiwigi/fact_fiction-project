if, how, and why living systems can be viewed as fundamentally

computational in nature [5, p. 2].

It is this role of computation in biology that has seen such
ubiquitous application in recent years and that will be the
focus of this paper.

Both computation and information processing are abstract
ideas that were originally developed in non-biological
domains, for purposes other than a better understanding of
biological phenomena. The fact that both sets of ideas have
found valuable applications in biology speaks to their
inherent generality. However, a fundamental issue is whether
they are *too general*. That is, if every biological phenom-
enon is computational (or, similarly, if every biological
phenomenon is information processing), then there seems
to be little gained by the application of those concepts. I dis-
tinguish between information processing and computation in
biological systems because I believe there are cases in which
we are tempted to attribute computation to a biological
phenomenon, when a lesser attribution of information pro-
cessing (without computation) would be just as effective.
