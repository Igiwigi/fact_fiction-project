hind limb, but the bones are a little longer and larger. The longest external claw is
nearly 4 inches long, 2 inches wide at the proximal end, and 14 inch deep. The
bones were in very hard rock, and the foot was not exposed as a whole in quarrying
it. Therefore, in arranging the remains to indicate five digits, I have been influenced
by the fact that portions of ten digits were found on the right side of the animal,
and no digit on the left side; and that the digits with large claws were in close
contact with the extremity of the ulna. I have no certain evidence of more than
three phalangeal bones in any digit, but it is possible that one digit may have
had four.
