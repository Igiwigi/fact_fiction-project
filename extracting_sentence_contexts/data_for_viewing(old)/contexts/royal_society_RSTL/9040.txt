The changes are supposed to proceed from internal causes, and to be any whatever;
and in the application made they will be supposed to go on with a uniform velocity.

1. The Equations of Motion.

M. Liovviite has given the equations of motion about a point of a body which is
slowly changing its shape from internal causes*; these equations, he says, 'are only
applicable to the case of the point being fixed or moving uniformly in a straight line.
They may, however, be extended to the motion of the earth about its centre of inertia,
because the centrifugal force due to the orbital motion and the unequal orbital motion
will not add any thing to the moments of the impressed forces. These equations are,
in fact, an extension of EvuueR's equations for the motion of a rigid body, which are
ordinarily applied to the precessional problem. To make them intelligible I reproduce
the following from Mr. Rovrn's © Rigid Dynamics'F, where the proof is given more
succinctly than in the original :;—

about the axes.
