Colour codes, labels and errors are the same as in previous figures. The data for Drouzet trees are shown for the DRM1 (blue),
DRM2 (green) and DRM3 (yellow) sequences, for the A15 (pink crosses) Italian trees placed on the new chronology with our

observed and simulated data for this abrupt event. Nevertheless, the fact that it occurs in a single
year in the AC record (14300-14299 cal yr BP) concomitant with a Be anomaly makes it a
probable SEP event with the largest magnitude evidenced so far, twice that of the eponymous 774
CE event [15].

9. The 14 cal kyr BP century-long “C and "Be excursion and the Older Dryas
climate event

Figure 12 illustrates the agreement between our observed Drouzet and the (°Be-based) simulated
AMC during an excursion between 14010 and 13910 cal yr BP. The correspondence in amplitude
(30%) strongly suggests that the excursion is linked to cosmogenic overproduction over the
course of a century, similar to the frequent Maunder-type solar minima of the last millennia (e.g.
[13,14,38]).
