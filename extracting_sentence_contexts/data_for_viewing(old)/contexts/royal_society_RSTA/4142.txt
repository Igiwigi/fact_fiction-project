The next generation of experiments in organic crystals [14-16] seemed to confirm that the
experimental T3 never exceeds a few times T). In other words, T3 remains tied to the time
scale that characterizes the reversible many-body interaction. This led to the postulate that, in
an infinite many-spin system, the complex dynamics could favour the action of any small non-
inverted interaction that perturbs the reversal procedure. Thus, reversible interactions become
determinant for the irreversibility rate. This constitutes our central hypothesis of irreversibility.
Such wisdom is further reinforced by the natural association of many-body complexity with a
form of chaos [17,18] and the confirmation that quantum dynamics of classically chaotic systems
should manifest a dynamical instability [19] which leads to an environment-independent decoherence
rate [20,21].

During the last decade, solid-state NMR has kept on providing a versatile testing bench
to study time reversal in large spin arrays [22-26]. In fact, a standard experiment involves a
crystalline sample with an infinitely large number of spins. By contrast, the numerical test of
many-spin dynamics has to be restricted to strictly finite systems [27,28]. While this appears to
be a major limitation, it allows the analysis of a situation that the experiments cannot achieve:
moving progressively from small systems to larger ones with a fully controlled perturbation. The
expectation is that a sort of finite size scaling may allow one to identify an emergent mechanism
that rules reversibility in the thermodynamic limit [29]. As in the experiments, the witness for such



a transition should be the LE as measured by a single spin autocorrelation function Mj 1, i.e. a local
polarization. For short, we call M;,; the local LE. It is not difficult to prove that J7,,; = (M1, + 1)/2
is the probability that a given spin, say the first, remains up after the whole procedure. Besides, in
