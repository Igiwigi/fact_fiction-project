Secondly, let us discuss more extensively the reasons why we represent a conceptual conjunction
by means of a superposed state vector in sector 1 of Fock space and by means of an entangled state
vector in sector 2. For every X = A,A’, Y =B, B’, the superposition state vector (1/v2) (|X) + |Y))
represents the conjunction ‘X and Y’ in sector 1. This choice expresses the fact that sector 1 of Fock
space formalizes the ‘genuinely emergent aspects of conceptual conjunctions’, — (1 / v2) (|X) +
|Y)) is a new state vector, obtained from the state vectors |X) and |Y) but without requiring
any logical rule to be satisfied. This will be evident in §5 after introducing ‘quantum emergent
thought’. The choice of representing the conjunction ‘X and Y’ by an entangled state vector |C) in
sector 2 allows instead the possibility of describing events that are not statistically independent in
this sector—if we represent ‘X and Y’ by the product state vector |X) ® |Y) in sector 2, this leads to
a probability (X)(Y) in this sector. In addition, there is a striking connection between logic and
classical probability when conjunction and negation of concepts are considered together. Namely,
the logical probabilistic structure of sector 2 of Fock space sets the limits of classical probabilistic
models, and vice versa. In other words, the experimentally collected membership weights j1(X),
w(Y) and p(X and Y), X=A,A’, Y=B,B’, satisfy equations (2.1)-(2.5), if and only if an entangled
state vector |C) and a decision measurement projection operator M exist such that 4(X), “(Y)
