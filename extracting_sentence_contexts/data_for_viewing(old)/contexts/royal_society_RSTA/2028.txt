integer-order counterpart, the mathematics and its applications are considerably less developed.
Many factors have contributed to this result, including the lack of methodologies to link both
geometrical and physical properties to the order of the fractional operator. On the other side,
fractional operators possess several extremely powerful features for the simulation of complex
physical systems. As an example, due to their differ-integral nature, fractional operators are
intrinsically multiscale. In fact, the order of the fractional derivative dictates the shape of the
influence function (kernel of the fractional derivative), while its interval defines the horizon
of its influence, i.e. the distance beyond which information is no longer accounted for in the
derivative. As a result, time-fractional operators enable memory effects, ie. the response of a
system is a function of its past history, and space fractional operators account for non-local and
scale effects. The unique set of properties of fractional operators have determined a surge of
interest in exploring their possible applications. Among the areas that have rapidly developed,
we encounter the modelling of viscoelastic materials [1-3], transport processes in complex media
[4-12], non-local elasticity [13-19] and model-order reduction of lumped parameter systems [20].
These applications mostly focused on constant-order (CO) fractional operators. Detailed reviews
on the use and applications of CO-FC can be found in [6,21-23].

Although the CO-FC formalism is capable of capturing some important physical mechanisms,
