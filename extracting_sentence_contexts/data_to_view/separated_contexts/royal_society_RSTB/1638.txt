It possesses scarcely anything typical,
which is also applicable to any other group of vertebrata. IT have abstained as much as possible from discussing and arguing out some of the
many contentious questions at issue in this paper, but I have tried to show how
certain errors have arisen. For the rest, for the correctness of the views taken in this essay, the facts
themselves must speak. The literature is so bulky and scattered, and the material
required is so vast and by no means always at hand, that it seemed advisable to
give a great number of illustrations. These are mostly drawings in outline and
slightly diagrammatic, but they are correct and are taken from actual specimens,

Uropeta.
