CUNNINGHAM (14), again, conducting his experiments on the nerves of the fore limb
in dogs, came to the conclusion that, although reunion was effected, it was not one
efficient to allow the function of the muscles to be carried on,

Accurate experiments in the union of the central segment of the divided pneumo-
gastric to the peripheral of the divided cervical sympathetic led Lanenry (15, 16) to
the conclusion that, “ when the central end of the vagus is joined to the peripheral

end of the cervical sympathetic, the vagus is capable of acquiring an influence upon
all the structures which are normally influenced by the cervical sympathetic,” and he
showed that, there being no pilo-motor fibres in the vagus, this function must be
assumed by one class changing to another. Also from the fact that paralytic signs
after the vagus had been joined to the cervical sympathetic disappeared or diminished,
i.e., contraction of the pupil, dilatation of the vessels of the ear, he concluded that the
vagus was exercising a tonic influence in the distribution of the cervical sympathetic. From his experiments in joining the central end of the lingual to the peripheral end of
the cervical sympathetic with recovery of sympathetic function, he concludes that
“ the vaso-dilator fibres of the lingual (chorda tympani), after becoming connected with
the nerve cells of the superior cervical ganglion, become motor fibres for unstriated
muscle, and, in especial, vaso-constrictor fibres for the arteries of the ear” (p. 268). ForssMAN (19) in 1900 published a research on the subject of Neurotropismus,
in which he studied the rate of regeneration when the central segment of a divided
nerve was united to its own peripheral segment and when united to that of another
divided nerve, and came to the conclusion that it was the same.
