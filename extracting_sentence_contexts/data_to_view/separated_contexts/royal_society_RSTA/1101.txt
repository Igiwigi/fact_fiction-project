One
could argue that methods aimed at only network topology are more useful and precise, but such
methods neglect the entire dynamical nature of many real networks. On the other hand, certain
methods give excellent results, but are limited to dynamical systems with specific properties. In
fact, our method belongs to this category, since it assumes the limit cycle nature of the individual
units. Furthermore, methods can be divided into invasive ones (that interfere with systemâ€™s
ongoing dynamics) and non-invasive ones (that do not). Again, their real merits are hard to
compare, since invasive methods, although often non practical, will almost always give better
results.
