as appears from symmetry, or, anew geometrically, by considering a point as the
intersection of three planes.
Operating on the last equation by S/’d we find, since n = fF = f/F’,

n(abed) = (flafbf'ef'd) =(fafbfefd). . . . . . (16).

The fact that (abcd) is a combinatorial function of a, 6, ¢ and d proves that m is an
invariant, or that it is quite independent of any particular set of quaternions, a, b, c, d.
This invariance is, however, established by the form of the equations (12) and (14).
