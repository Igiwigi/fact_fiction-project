disease patients that bind to gluten proteins (such as gliadin)
are also stereotyped, and preferentially encoded by two
heavy/light chain combinations: VH3-23/VLambda4-69 or
VH3-15/Vk4-1 [50]. These stereotyped autoantibody
responses could arise from the mechanism of tolerance
escape described above for VH4-34-encoded cold-agglutinins
(figure 1c). Alternatively, certain B-cell subpopulations that
have stereotyped BCRs (figure 1a) may be more prone to
cause autoimmune diseases.

Current research efforts are directed at identifying the
particular epitopes of autoimmune stereotyped B cells or
exploiting the fact that these cells have structurally unique
surface immunoglobulins. These cells, when causing pathol-
ogy, make an attractive potential target for therapy because
of their conserved nature. It may be possible to reduce path-
ology with anti-idiotypic antibodies used to deplete the
offending cells in a specific manner. Further, by understand-
ing the targets of these stereotyped autoantibodies, measures
can be taken to avoid or control autoimmune pathology.

B-cell receptors

As many as 30% of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukae-
