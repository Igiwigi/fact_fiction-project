shows that for nearly an hour mostly positively charged rain fell. This period coincided
with the central part of the cloud. In spite of rapid removal of charge the field often
tended to become positive.

When the rear part of the cloud came overhead at about 18 hrs. 20 mins., the field
remained intensely negative for nearly an hour. During this period mostly negatively
charged rain fell. The loss of negative charge and to a certain extent generation of
positive charge by the process already explained led the rear part of the cloud to acquire
an excess of positive charge and the field to become positive. That the cloud had really
an excess of positive charge is confirmed by the fact that during the period the rain-
drops mostly brought down positive charge.

Lightning discharges occurred overhead in rapid succession during the period shown
by P and Q on the electrogram. These caused violent and very quick changes in the
record. In fact, they were so quick that it is difficult to count their number and some
left no impression on the photographic paper. The quick-run record obtained
for this thunderstorm enables us to distinguish the sudden displacement caused by each
lightning discharge and shows that there were in all about 150 such displacements
during the period. The extremely quick fluctuations in the portions LM and SR of
the electrogram are also due to lightning discharges.
