The total effective
lifetime in low-level injection would then follow from adding up the inverse lifetimes and then
inverting the resulting sum again leading to

Note that Teg in equation (2.5) is a constant, carrier concentration independent value. This is due
to the fact that even the two recombination mechanisms (radiative and Auger) that are in general
nonlinear, become linear in minority carrier concentration in low-level injection. The doping
density sets a natural upper limit to the effective lifetime, which can never exceed the value in the
radiative limit that is given by Teg = [kraq(1 — pr)N, 'a]~!. Because k,aq in direct semiconductors is
typically on the order of 10-10 cm3 s! (e.g. 2 x 107! cm? s~! in GaAs [27,28], 0.6 x 10719 cem3 s~}
to 2x 10-!° cm? s~! in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 with different In to Ga ratios [29]), lifetimes of hundreds
of ns are already a good value for direct semiconductors at typical doping concentrations of
10'6 cm~%.
