Coll. 1985. Now if an apical section of the immature, still coiled, frond of a fern is examined
the developing pinnz are recognisable as a series of conical outgrowths, developing
acropetally a little way behind the apical cell itself, and it is reasonable to suppose that
if, in Ankyropteris corrugata, lateral pinne were present, a similar configuration would
result. In actual fact there are no indications whatever of lateral structures suggesting
developing pinne, and the coiled apex is perfectly smooth (text-fig. 27, a). The remaining sections of the immature apical region of the frond are transverse, or
nearly so, the Kidston specimens being cut somewhat nearer the apex than those in
the University College (London) Collection. In neither case is there any evidence of the
occurrence of flattened pinnz, although in view of the delicacy of the tissues actually
preserved one would have expected them to be present had they existed (Plate 10,
figs. 33, 34).
