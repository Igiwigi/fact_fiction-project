This was tried with several metals, but always

with the same result. Beyond small changes in the gradients no alteration in the
Eshape of the curve was produced, and the kink still remained. In fact, if one
vradually builds up a composite screen of a number of different metals, the logarithmic
‘curve of transmission consists of a series of discontinuous steps made up of an initially
“Bsteep and a subsequently flatter portion for each metal. It is clear that the results are not due to the presence of any soft radiation, but we
‘Bean find a ready explanation of the earlier steepness in the curves if we consider the
“geffects of secondary radiation. At every stage the primary radiation transmitted by
Ba screen is augmented by a certain amount of secondary radiation (in part softer
than the primary) from the screen itself.
