It was pro-
posed that GluN2A-NMDARs associate preferentially with
PSD95, which is believed to limit their field of action to the
PSD and increase their half-life time before recycling
[38,43-47]. Because they tend to interact with SAP102
rather than with PSD95, GluN2B-NMDARs are thought to
be more mobile, widespread and not confined to synapses
in adults [45,47]. In fact, the expression of GluN2A and
GluN2B subunits closely follows the expression of PSD95
and SAP102, respectively, during development [47], and evi-
