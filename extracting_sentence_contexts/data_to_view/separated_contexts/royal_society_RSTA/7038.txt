Now ¢,;! is in B but not in H, because of (ii). Ifa and a’ were not in H, the left-hand side
of our equation would have length >4 and could not be the unit element. Hence at least
one of a, a’ is in H, and then g is in H because of (i). (In fact then a, a’ are both in H.) I

follows that G,o G,CH,

and thus G,o G, = H. Now let 8 be a set of left coset representatives of A modulo H. Thus every element ae A is
uniquely of the form a=sh (seS, heH).
