uſing glaſs plates for the ornamenting the walls of
apartments to. that of © introducing light into thoſe
apartments, (as we find the /apis fpecularis was in
fact employed atthe ſame time for both thoſe purpoſes) -
and conſequently it ſeems reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that
the latter of theſe applications could not be: long in
point of time after the former. But it appears from
the authorities produced above, that the former
of theſe uſages did aQtually fubſiſt in the age (23)
of Pliny; and therefore before the deſtruftion of
Herculaneum, where he loft his life (24). From
whence we may draw no improbable conclufion,
that the latter deſtination of plates of glaſs, (viz,
for window-fences) did likewiſe precede the ſame
event, L

Give me leave to add further, that this preſump-
tive argument in favour of the antiquity of windows
made of plates of glaſs receives an additional force
from the cloſe relation, which -muſt be allowed/ to
ſubfiſt between them, and thoſe compoſed of - the '
lapts ſpecularis.
