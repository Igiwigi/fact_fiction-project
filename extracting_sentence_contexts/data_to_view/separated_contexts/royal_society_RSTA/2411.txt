showed that composite materials comprising mixtures of tungsten carbides and borides were also
effective in enhancing neutron attenuation [8]. Despite recent progress in shield design, the maximum irradiation level that HTS tape can
accommodate without degrading is not yet known. In fact, a limited amount of irradiation
may be beneficial for tape performance. For example, in YBCO and GdBCO tapes irradiated
in the range 30-50°C, the critical current density increases marginally up to moderate neutron
fluences (of about 10??/m?), before degrading again at higher fluences [9-11]. The irradiation-
induced change in critical current is dependent on the operating temperature.
