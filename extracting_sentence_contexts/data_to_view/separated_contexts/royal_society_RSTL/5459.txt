TI need not stay to prove that the effects observed by
means of the galvanometer, produced by a muscle in contraction, cannot depend either
on a portion of the current employed to irritate the nerve, or on changes of contact
between the muscle and the extremities of the galvanometer, or finally, on the variable
resistance of a muscle in contraction ; these doubts have already been completely removed
by the experiments of M. Du Bois REyMoxnD. In endeavouring to understand the nature
of the electrical phenomena which occur in a muscle during contraction, the fact which
merits our chief attention is, that the needle of the galvanometer, which deflects at first
in the direction of the muscular current of the gastrocnemius, or of the entire thigh,
descends rapidly to zero at the moment of contraction and remains deflected in an oppo-
site direction to that of the muscular current, during the whole time that the contrac-

tions are frequent and powerful. M. PoviLLer, in his remarkable report *, gives a lucid
re8ume of the conclusions at which M.
