yet it does not behave
as a true free-water-table should do, in a“ sakia ” forexample. Frrrar and AUDEBEAU
have shown that the wave coming from the river bed through the sakia gravels cuts the
steadily falling curve from last year’s wave quite suddenly, and that although the
pressure changes can be transmitted rapidly, the movement of the bulk of water occurs

later than one might expect, so that the rise of a sakia pit on the Pyramids Road at
4 km. from the river is shown by Ferrar to take place fully two months after the river
rise. This figure has to be reconciled with the fact that the wave affects similar pits
in the lower Delta equally soon, at distances much greater ; this can be done by remem-
bering that the water leaving the river flows down the valley (which slopes 1 m. in
13 km.) as well as falling outward, so that the water reaching a well situated 4 km. from
the river may have traversed 40 km. underground from upstream. The water-paths
would look like feathers if mapped.
