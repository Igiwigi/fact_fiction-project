STORY-MASKELYNE ON THE

oxidation of the sulphide. When the adhering silicate and this crust have been remoyed,
the mineral is readily cleayed in three directions. The mean of nearly 200 measure-
ments of the normal angles of these cleavage-planes gave 89? 57, That this angle is
really 90* and the mineral cubic in its system, rendered probable by the equal facility
of the three cleavages, is placed beyond doubt by the fact that transparent sections
made along either plane, when examined by polarised light, afford no indications what-
ever of double refraction. The hardness of the mineral is nearly 4; its density is 2:58,
Boiled with water it breaks up, yielding a bright-yellow solution of calcium polysulphides
and an insoluble residue. With acids it readily dissolyes with eyolution of hydrogen sul-
Phide and deposition of suIphur.

'The small amount of the mineral at command for analysis, the desirability of excluding
as far as possible during the process all non-volatile materials from admixture with the
constituents of the meteorite, and, as it afterwards proved, the unnecessary precaution of
not using any reagent that might destroy or prevent the subsequent selection of the
microscopic octahedra that have been alluded to, seemed to render a special method of
analysis necesSary.
