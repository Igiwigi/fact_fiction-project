HOMOTYPOSIS IN THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM. B23

the whole ground covered with low plants of Malva Rotundifolia.* On inquiry I
found that a cottage had recently stood on the site, and that the cottagers kept in
their herb-bed a small clump of this plant for the preparation of a local ointment of
high repute. When the cottage was removed the mallow had spread over the whole
patch, I believe very little by seed, but largely by stolons. This seemed to provide
excellent material ready to hand, and from it we can draw some conclusions as to the
influence of such a division on the degree of resemblance of like parts. It will be
remembered that Darwry,} in experimenting on Origanum vulgare, found that
& cross-fertilisation of flowers on plants which had separate roots, but had spread by
5 stolons from the same individual, presented no advantage over self-fertilisation, and
-2 he concluded that this arose from the fact that the plants were really one and the
2 same individual so far as such processes were concerned. If this were so in the case
A of my mallow, we ought to find a great reduction in the relationship of undiffer-
= éntiated like organs. Two points struck me at the outset—the small variability in
ic the segmentation of the seed vessels and the low mean value (13°7) compared with
= that (15) given in botanical works. I was able to collect 127 plants; of these, 76
% had more than 26 capsules, some many more, and of these I took 26 only ; 51 plants
<a had fewer than 26 capsules, and although I took buds in every stage of development |
3 I could not make up my number to this, often only obtaining 10, or even fewer. As |
& the potatoes were being removed the mallows had to be taken up before the seeds were
3 ripe, and the seed-vessels artificially dried. The counting of the segments proved a :
4 very laborious task. To Miss M. Norcurr I owe a considerable portion of the
S counting. The buds and small seed vessels requiring a lens or small microscope were
