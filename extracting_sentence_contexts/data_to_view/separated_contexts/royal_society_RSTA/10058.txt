In order to test the law with great accuracy, we ought to examine it over a range
of dilutions so high that the viscosity is practically constant and the increase of ionic
size (if any) is practically complete. In such a case we might expect to find the value
of n practically constant and equal to 3, if the Van â€™t Hoff law holds accurately. It
is impossible to make such a test, owing to the fact that the error introduced by the
uncertainty us to the correction for the conductivity of the solvent, multiplied by the
