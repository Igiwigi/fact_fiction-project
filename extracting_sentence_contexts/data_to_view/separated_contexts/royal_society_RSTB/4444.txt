Although in broad outline, the above suggestion seems to afford a reasonable
interpretation of Acmopyle in terms of Podocarpus, there remains one difficulty,
which must at present remain unexplained, namely, the double nature of the cupule
on the ventral side of the seed. Is it that the erection of the seed from the
Podocarpus-like condition took place in two distinct stages, so that first the outer
ventral are was acquired and then the inner? The fact that of the two arcs the
inner extends to a point nearer the chalaza (see text-fig. 6) than does the outer at
any rate does not contradict this hypothesis. In this connection an examination of
younger material would be of some interest. On the other hand, it may of course be
that the process of erection is not merely ontogenetic, but is spread over the
phylogeny of Acmopyle.
