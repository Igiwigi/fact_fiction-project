The actual quantity of divergence necessary in any case is a question of consider-
able importance. As regards that in the horizontal direction, we have only to consider
the practical question of the proportion of light to darkness in a revolution of the light
frame. Thus, for example, three faces, each illuminating 16* of the horizon, and re-
volving in 8 minutes, would produce the same effect as six faces, each illuminating 8*,
and revolving in 16 minutes. The decision will then be made by reference to the
divergence in the vertical direction, the value of which will depend upon the situation
of the lighthouse ; for if the vertical divergence be too small, a ship might under pe-
culiar cireumstances be 80 near the lighthouse as not to catch the light at all, being,
in fact, under the lowest rays; whereas shonld the situation of the lighthouse be snch
that a vessel never can approach within two or three miles of it, it is useless to throw
away light upon a part where it can neyer be wanted; bearing in mind however that
the refraction which now and then takes place might, in the event of the divergence
being too small, prevent a yessel on the horizon from seeing the light, even were she
at a proper distance to be able to discern it in the natural state of the atmosphere :
some little excess therefore of the practical above the computed angle is requisite.

The following Table shows the vertical divergence required in lighthouses from 100
to 500 feet above the level of the sea, the distance at which the light is first required
to be seen being from half to four miles from the lighthouse.
