IV. The su{phate of magnesia and the sulphate of lime, both
enter into the composition of all the varieties of salt prepared
from sea water ; but the sulphate of lime aloneis found in
Cheshire salt. The proportion of sulphate of magnesia is
greatest in that variety of sea salt, which has been formed by
rapid evaporation. In foreign bay salt, its quantity is very
insignificant.

From the table it may be seen, that the proportion of sul-
phate of lime is greater in foreign bay salt, than in any variety
of British salt, even than in those which are prepared from
sea water with a boiling heat. The only explanation of this
fact, that occurs to me, is, that during the rapid evaporation of
sea water, a considerable part of the calcareous sulphate is
precipitated at an early stage of the process, and is partly re-
moved in clearing the boiler, a process, which can scarcely be
performed: during the formation of bay salt, in pits whose

_ $ides are composed of moist clay. The remamder of the sele-
nite, thus precipitated by the rapid evaporation of sea_ water,
enters into the composition/ of the pan=scale.

In the course' of this inquiry, I was induced to repeat the
same experiments s$everal times, on various Specimens of salt
bearing the same designation ; and was zurprised to find, that
