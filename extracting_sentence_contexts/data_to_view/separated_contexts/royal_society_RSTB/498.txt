If, therefore, nitrogen has not been derived from
the atmosphere, the conclusion must be that some has come from the subsoil. The indication was that nitrification had been more active under the influence of
the leguminous than of the gramineous growth and crop-residue. In fact, under the
influence of leguminous growth, not only will there be increased nitrogenous matter
for nitrification, but it would seem that the development of the nitrifying organisms
will be favoured. The question is, therefore, whether part of the result be not due
to the passage downwards of the nitrifying organisms, and the nitrification of the
nitrogen of the subsoil. The alternative was suggested, that the soil and subsoil might still be the source of
the nitrogen of the crops, but that the plants may take up, at any rate part of their
supply, in other forms than as nitric acidâ€”as ammonia, or as organic nitrogen, for
example.
