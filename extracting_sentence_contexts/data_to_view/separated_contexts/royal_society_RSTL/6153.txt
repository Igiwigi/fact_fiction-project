From the similarity of the curves of alloys, where we may assume, from their chemical
behaviour, that we have only a solution of one metal in another, we may always draw
approximatively the curve of the alloys of any two metals, if we know to which class
they belong. Thus before a single copper-gold alloy had been determined, the curve
was almost correctly drawn, and agreed with that which was afterwards found by expe-
riment. 'That some alloys are chemical combinations may be deduced from the following
facts â€”

1. At the turning-points of the curve we generally find the alloys contract or expand.

2. There is no regular form of curve (se those of gold-tin, gold-lead, and silver-
copper), 80 that it cannot be & priort even approximatively represented.
