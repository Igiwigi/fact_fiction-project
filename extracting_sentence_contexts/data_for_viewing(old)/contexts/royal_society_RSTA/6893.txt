eI expressible in the form (18).

@ The maximum permissible value of A for a continuous free surface to exist is given by

the maximum value of A defined by the implicit relation

P(A, x,y) =; (69)

where # is the pressure expressed in non-dimensional units. The function f(A, x,y) is in
fact the left-hand side of equation (17).
Since A, regarded asa function of real variables x and y, is to be a maximum, we must have
