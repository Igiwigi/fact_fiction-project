Equation (3.24) can also be obtained by defining a in equation (3.10) by
ap = Patel /2-Mo/p) = Patm . 325)

M/p
and proceeding following a similar approach as before, exploiting maximum principles and the
governing equations of the water waves.
Equation (3.24) provides a bound less sharper than the one given by equation (3.23). In fact,
a sharper bound is obtained from equation (3.23) and is given by

2p?9(k —c)*d*
[P(0, —dint) — Patm]?’
if velocity measurements are not available and cannot be used.
If pressure measurements are not available and only velocity measurements are available
instead, then the following bound is obtained from equation (3.22) (since P(L/2,—dint) > Patm;
see [14])
