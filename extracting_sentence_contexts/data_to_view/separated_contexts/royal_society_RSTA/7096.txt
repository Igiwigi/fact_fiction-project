which is in fact of the exact form of the Laplace transformation since the operator g now only
appears in the factor e~# of the integrand. Thus the interpretation of equation (49) may be
immediately written down as u(y, a) = I(Ay, €), (50)

where J is a function of two variables defined by

We have now found that equation (50) gives a solution of the integral equation (30) when
v is the special case given by equation (44), i.e. we have obtained the relation

AY "Tyo 28) Ko |y—Yo I} ao = KlA(y+} (Y>0, £20), (52)

where J is defined by equation (51). This relation (52) is the basic result required for the solution of our physical problem and
in appendix A is given a direct check of this result by substitution from equation (51) and
some manipulation in integration.
