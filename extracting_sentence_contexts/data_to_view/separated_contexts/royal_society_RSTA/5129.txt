Hi to his transversals or to his polar plane ; and the memoir ends with a remark ‘“ which
may be necessary to prevent any misconception as to the nature of the foundation on

& Systals act upon light are included in the general equations of dynamics. This fact

2 used to account for the form of the function is indirect, and cannot be regarded as
z sufficient, in a mechanical point of view. It is, however, the only kind of reasoning
that we are able to employ, as the constitution of the luminiferous medium is
entirely unknown.”
