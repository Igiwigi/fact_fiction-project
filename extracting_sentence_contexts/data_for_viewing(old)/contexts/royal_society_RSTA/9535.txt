By introducing a thermocouple into a molten ingot, tracing the cooling curve,
remelting, cooling to selected points on the curve and chilling at these points, we can
by microscopic examination correlate the change in structure with the thermal

changes. The change in structure occurring at the recalescence is especially
remarkable. For example, Al 14 chilled at any temperature above 420° C. is a
uniform solid solution of closely fitting polygons showing no trace of a second
material, but chilled at 400° C. it becomes filled with polygons, bars, and sprays of a
second material, and from the fact that the new substance shows a tendency to
margin the old polygonal divisions, it is probable that it is richer in aluminium than
the original alpha (Plate 5, fig. 10).

The same change occurs spontaneously in all alloys from Al 14 to Al20 when they
are cooled below 400° C. and either chilled or not. Ingots of Al15 and of Al 18,
chilled the first at 380° C. and the second at 410° C., show the striation in the alpha
and the specks and crinkles in the beta, both alpha and beta having been uniform
before the recalescence (figs. 11, 12, and 13). The change in the beta seems to be
the most important and to contribute most of the heat evolved.

The recalescence may occur in the beta itself before the temperature has fallen low
enough to allow of the formation of the L eutectoid, but, as a rule, the eutectoid
