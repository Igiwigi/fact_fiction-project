The magnitude
of this nonlinear term is maximized when the perpendicular components of the wavevectors of
the interacting Alfvén waves are orthogonal, k,1 -k 2 =0, so we expect the nonlinear energy


transfer to be dominated by interactions in which the colliding Alfvén waves are perpendicularly 6 |
polarized [17]. For this case of orthogonal perpendicular wavevector components, kj -kj2=

0, the resulting magnitude of the perpendicular component of k3 will satisfy k,3>k.1 and 3
k\3 =k 2. In summary, the parallel wavevector component of Alfvénic fluctuations decreases or : s
remains constant due to the fact that only counter-propagating Alfvén waves interact nonlinearly, :<
while the perpendicular wavevector component of the fluctuations generally increases as a : 3S
result of the dominance of nonlinear interactions between perpendicularly polarized Alfvén 1g

waves. Thus, the resulting nonlinear energy transfer is expected to be anisotropic, with energy
preferentially flowing towards smaller scales in the perpendicular direction rather than in the
parallel direction. The argument presented above is similar to a previous explanation of anisotropic energy
transfer [52,54-56,65,66] which relies on the wavevector k3 =k; + k and frequency w3 = @1 + 2
matching conditions in the weak turbulence limit for resonant interactions between Alfvén : =

waves with wavevectors k; and kj.
