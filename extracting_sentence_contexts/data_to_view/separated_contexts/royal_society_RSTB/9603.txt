species with the NS located in different positions with respect highly conserved protein that acts as a calcium receptor located
to the epidermis: from a NS built as a basiepidermal plexus to a in synaptic vesicles [58]. The structures revealed in both
NS completely positioned below the epidermis, with some adult and juvenile developmental stages coincide with those
species showing some intermediate states (as in the case of obtained using neuronal or neurotransmitter markers such as
Marcusiola tinga, where the dorsal neurite bundles are at the the anti-tubulin tyrosine antibody, or the anti-serotonin and
base of the epidermis while the rest is positioned clearly RFamide antibodies [50,51]. However, our synaptotagmin
