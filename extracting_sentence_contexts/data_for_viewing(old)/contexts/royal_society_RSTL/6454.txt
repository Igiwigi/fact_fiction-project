To the first Division of this Table, which shows only the relation of Fat itsetf to the
nitrogenous compounds in the staple of our animal food, and without any assumptions
as to its probable equivalent food-value compared with other snbstances, little exception
can be taken. The striking fact appears, that, whether we take the composition of the
entire carcas8es including bone, or that of the estimated otal consumed portions of the
animals, the average of those of them supposed to be sufficiently fattened, shows from
34 to 4 parts of dry Fat, to 1 of dry nitrogenous substances. Taking the estimates of the
total consumed portions to be pretty near the truth, the fat Calf shows 14 time, the fat
Ox 25 times, the fat Lamb, fat Sheep, and the fat Pig nearly 44 times, and the very fat
Sheep 64 times as much dry fat, as drynitrogenous or 80-called * Aesh-forming‚Äù constituents.
The average of the 10 entire Carcasses even, including bone, and of which several Were
certainly in a leaner condition than as usually 801d, gives 2:85 parts of dry fat to 1
