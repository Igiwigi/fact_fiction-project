1693). Of these, only Leibniz gave an equation, equivalent to (4.8), but without proof and with no
mention of the underlying differential equation; but he does state that his differential calculus was
the key to the solution.

David Gregory (1659-1708), a Scottish mathematician at the University of Oxford, was
keen to apply ‘the method of fluxions’ of his contemporary Isaac Newton (1642-1727) to the
solution of problems. In 1697 he published in Philosophical Transactions—in Latin—an elaborate
demonstration of Leibniz’ result [29]. Unfortunately, he gave an erroneous derivation of the
correct differential equation. Gregory’s major error lay in his failure to appreciate that it is the
difference between tensions on each end of a small element of chain which balances its gravity:
as Truesdell [23] remarks, this is ‘one more example to show that the local balance of forces,
which we are all taught to regard as the simplest approach to the mechanics of continuous
media, is in fact not an obvious concept’. But once he has stated the correct equation, Gregory
goes on to prove all of Leibniz’ results competently. Gregory’s paper was reprinted in Acta,
July 1698. Leibniz soon pointed out, anonymously, Gregory’s basic deficiency in the Acta of
February 1699, unjustly attributing it to a defect in Newton’s fluxional method. He challenged
Gregory to discuss the problem with Newton; but Newton diplomatically declined to become
involved. Jacob Bernoulli likewise attacked Gregory: ‘his work shows neatly how it is possible
for us to be misled through an inevident and false, though plausible, argument to a true
conclusion’.
