For simplicity, we shall throughout ignore dimensions, and denote
such terms of the first order by O(1/Q), and terms of the second order by O (1/0?). *
The arithmetical values of the various terms are investigated in detail in § 4.3 below. The above facts indicate the lines on which an approximate solution is to be
sought—we require the asymptotic expansion of the solution (or its leading terms)
for large values of the parameter Q. Methods of obtaining such expansions have

* In practice the spin N, and therefore 2, decreases slightly along the trajectory, but the diminution
is not sufficient to affect the assumption that 2 is large. THE AERODYNAMICS OF A SPINNING SHELL.
