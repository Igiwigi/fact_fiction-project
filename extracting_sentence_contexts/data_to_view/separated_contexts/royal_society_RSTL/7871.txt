For shearing-forces the maximum lies
between one half and three fifths of the displacement, and for bending-moments between
one seyenth and one sixth of the product of the displacement by the length. These are,
of course, to be regarded simply as limiting values; in practice they can scarcely occur,
because no ship is likely to rest at the extremities only without having a moderate base
of support. 'The amount of the strains actually experienced would depend, obviously,
upon the length of the base of support and its greater or less nearness to the bow and
stern. When a ship ashore rests upon a middle support and has her ends unsupported, which
in the other extreme position she can occupy, 8he is, as I have aid, less 8everely strained

<than when resting on the ends only, the reason for this fact being that the heavy weights
Sarried in the amidship portion are comparatively close to the point of support in one
ase, whereas in the other they are much more distant. The greatest difference in
Strains should consequently be looked for in ships having very concentrated weights
Sunidships; and it is interesting to remark that while such a concentration has been
Shown to be beneficial in reducing most of the principal strains experienced by ships
Bfloat, it is the cause of the increase in sagging-strains in ships ashore. A ship having
er weights uniformly distributed throughout the length would be subject, when sup-
Sorted at the middle only, to hogging-moments equalling in amount the sagging-
AZnoments incidental to snpport at the extremities.
