Porcupine (Sphingurus villosus) has a vermilion fundus covered with large lake-
coloured dots, no choroidal vessels being visible. Neither of these Porcupines show
any trace of capillaries in the disc, nor any trace of a “ pecten,” the dise being
entirely uniform as in the Edentata.

Leporide.—The Rabbits have a deep vermilion-red fundus, and the Hares an
almost lake-coloured fundus, but in other respects they are similar. A round-oval
white disc is to be seen considerably above the visual axis. From this dise large
retinal vessels branch out right and left in a horizontal plane, and the area they
oceupy is covered by bundles of completely opaque nerve fibres, forming a pair of
broad white feather-like streaks, which part at the disc. The fact that all the retinal
vessels run entirely in these bundles, which are all above the line of vision, points to
an admirable contrivance of nature by which their inherent opacity affords no obstacle
to the animal’s vision.

In the lighter-coloured Rabbits choroidal vessels can be seen. In the Albinos, the
dense choroidal vascularisation is visible, as also the places where the vessels enter
the choroid through the sclerotic.

The Leporide, judging from the eye alone, ought to be placed between the
Sciuromorpha and the Hystricomorpha, as the eye is no doubt less developed than
that of the Squirrels, whilst the presence of retinal vessels shows it to be of a higher
type than that of the Hystricomorpha, which resemble the Marsupials in all families
