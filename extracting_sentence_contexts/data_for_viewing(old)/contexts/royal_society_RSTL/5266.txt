minute ducts, some of them may bave imparted a slight admixture of bile which was
not derived from the parenchyma ; or, which is perhaps unavoidable, some oleic acid
may have been dissolved by the menstruum, and given, as it is said to do, a similar
reaction with PgeTTENKOFER's test as bile itself. Before I was aware that albuminous
matter produced with sugar and sulphuric acid the saine reaction as bile, I conceived
that I had found certain proof of the presence of biliary matter in the cells by applying
this test to a thin slice of liver and watching the changes under the microscope ;
under the action of the acid the tissxue became much more translucent, and developed
along its margin a beautiful permanent crimson tint. The very same however, even
more intense, was produced by treating a section of kidney in a similar way, so that
it was manifest the reaction depended on nothing special to the liver.

One other fact we may receive from chemistry, which is also corroborative of the
view that the sugar and bile are not produced in the same parts, viz. that the bile
does not contain the hepatic sugar. M. Bernarv distinctly states this, and on
repeating the experiment I obtained the same result. Sugar therefore seems to be
the normal product of the cells, bile of the ultimate biliary ducts.

Mr. Noap has been kind enough to execute s0me analyses for me, which go to
show that the kind of food influences decidedly the amount of sugar contained or
formed in the liver. The subject of the first was a young dog, who was fed for six days
on bread and meat ; the quantity of sugar contained in his liver, as determined by
fermentation, was 20-13 grs. per 1000. The second, a young kitten, was fed for six
days on food as far as possible of the saccharine kind, rice, sugar, arrow-root and
potatoes; this disordered her bowels after some days, but by leaving off the rice and
