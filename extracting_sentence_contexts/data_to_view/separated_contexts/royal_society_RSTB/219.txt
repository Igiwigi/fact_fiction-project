a The knee is thus represented all over the entire lower limb area, the total number of

movements observed being 141 (¢/: Ankle). Further on we shall draw attention to the fact that the movements of the knee are

essentially dependent upon those of the hip.
(ii.) Primary Representation.—The knee we have observed to move primarily only
ten times, i.e. sth of the total primary movements of all the segments of the lower

limb. And, moreover, of these ten times, in four it was associated with other synergic
Consequently its réle as a joint of

primary movements, i.e., of hip and other joints.
