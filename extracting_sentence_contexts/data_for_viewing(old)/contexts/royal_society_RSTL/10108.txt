(b) A deeper streak beneath the large swollen cells of second layer.*

The superficial stripe is, however, here the shallower of the two, and the deeper
stripe attains a width equal to the first band in the upper limbic are. In horizontal
sections the medullated fibres of these two streaks will be divided obliquely. In
sections such as I have just been considering a rich series of arcuate fibres will also
be found extending backwards through the extra-limbic lobe from the anterior realms
of the brain, which thin out gradually towards the abrupt line of denser medulla,
commencing at the limbic sulcus, and wholly disappear here. This is the arcuate
system of the extra-limbic medulla.

The above facts enable me to conelude that at the occipital pole of the hemisphere
there are two important regions definitely mapped out by coarse external configuration
of the brain and also by minate structural divergences.

These regions are histologically distinguished by the possession of a cortex, which is
peculiar to each, and which we have named respectively the modified upper and lower
limbic types. Each region is associated with that of the opposite hemisphere by the
callosal commissure.

Each region is brought into relationship with the olfactory lobe and bulb; the
upper limbic by means of the arcuate olfactory, the lower limbic through the medium
of the central olfactory fasciculi after the decussation in the posterior commissure.
