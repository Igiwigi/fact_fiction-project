The above observations on the nutrition of articular cartilage during the earliest
periods of its development have been principally confined to preparations of foetal
Calves, from my not having been able to procure those of the human feetus suffi-
ciently numerous and varied for my purpose. My more limited examinations, how-
ever, of the human foetus, have led me also to the conclusions, that during the most
early periods, the cartilage of the epiphysal extremities of bones does not contain any
blood-vessels, and that notwithstanding their absence, the cells of this cartilage are

developed, and its growth carried on; and that at the same time the cells of the epi-

physal and the articular cartilage are formed and developed without the presence of
vessels. I think it may be naturally deduced from the facts demonstrated in the foregoing
dissections,â€”

First. That during the most early periods of fetal life, the growth of cartilage
takes place, and that its component cells or corpuscles undergo certain progressive
changes in their form and size, without the presence in its substance of any blood-
vessels. Secondly.
