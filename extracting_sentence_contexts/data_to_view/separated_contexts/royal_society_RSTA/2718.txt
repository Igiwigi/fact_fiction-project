The calculated intensities are
reduced to the same units as the observed intensities by multiplying the former by the mean value of the
ratios of the intensities corresponding to the different wave-lengths. The results are compared graphically
in Diagram XIII. The agreement is seen to be fairly satisfactory, in spite of the fact that the mean values
of the coeflicients of attenuation are used in calculating intensities on a particular day. * ‘Annals,’ vol.
