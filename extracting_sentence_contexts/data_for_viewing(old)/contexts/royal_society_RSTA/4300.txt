at the atomic level. We can simply work with a collection of atoms and an isometry group. The
simplest objective structures are the orbits of a single atom position under an isometry group.
The examples above raise the question of whether two objective structures, each generated as the
orbit of a single atom position, can meet along an interface with perfect matching of atoms across
the interface. Here we show by examples that this is the case. In fact, the method of construction
here is strictly mathematically analogous to the method used to construct the helical structures
shown in figure 6b. A complete analysis is given in a forthcoming paper [43].

Helical atomistic structures are surprisingly common. All single-walled carbon nanotubes of
all chiralities are given by a helical group acting ona single atomic position. (See [39] for formulae
for the helical groups.) They are particularly common in viruses. In [13], it is shown that the
positions and orientations of molecules on the tail sheath of bacteriophage T4 are accurately given
by a helical group operating on a single molecule. In fact, the tail sheath of this virus actually
undergoes a phase transformation during the process of infection, and both phases are orbits

transformations and Diao et al. [42] for interesting, atomistic effects such as surface energy induced phase transformation
in atomistic theory.
