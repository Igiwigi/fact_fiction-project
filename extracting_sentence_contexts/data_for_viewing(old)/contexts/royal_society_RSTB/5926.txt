this species the proximal position of the pigment is the resting (7.e., relaxed) state of
the melanophore, as must be inferred from the fact that the denervated skin is green
in the absence of photic stimulation, it appears from Smrrxâ€™s data that heat induces
@ state of relaxation, and cold promotes the opposite state (excitation). It is not
unreasonable to assume, on purely theoretical grounds, that an independent effector
which is found to respond to photic and thermal stimulation, should respond to both
kinds of stimuli in the same way. With the melanophores of A. equestris this is
apparently not so; they expand in light and are contracted by heat. In the absence
of other experimental data it is difficult to suggest an explanation. The experiment
with the dorso-lateral preparation (p. 47), if carried out on these species, would go
far towards elucidating the main difficulties that at present exist.

In view of the fact that all reptiles whose pigmentary responses have been physio-
logically investigated belong to one class, namely, the Lacertilia, and since, further,
all observations point to the conclusion that the reactions to environmental conditions
are superficially alike, namely, pallor in darkness and on exposure to high temperatures
and darkening in light, it is difficult to believe that they are physiologically totally
dissimilar, and that an elaborate apparatus of tonic innervation and central inhibition
should exist in one species and be quite unrepresented in another.

In the present state of knowledge one can do no more than hope that when the
background responses of other reptiles have been thoroughly investigated, and the
problem of direct reactivity finally solved, the materials for the formulation of a general
theory of reptilian colour change will be obtained.
