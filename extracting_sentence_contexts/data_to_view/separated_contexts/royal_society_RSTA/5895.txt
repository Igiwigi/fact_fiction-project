A full quantum approach is then necessary
to properly account for these quantum effects. Usual approaches for such simulations use a
multi-configuration expansion in combination with multi-dimensional grids (see for example the
multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree method [23,24]). Some drawback of these methods
are the necessity of generating a model Hamiltonian beforehand, and the fact that grid-based
methods scale exponentially with the number of dimensions. Both limitations can be addressed
using another common representation of the nuclear wavepackets employing an expansion
in terms of time-dependent Gaussian functions [25-33]. This representation has the strong
advantage that it avoids evaluation of the Hamiltonian integrals over multi-dimensional grid
by using Gaussian integration when possible, or by using a local approximation motivated by the
fact that Gaussian functions have a limited spatial extension.
