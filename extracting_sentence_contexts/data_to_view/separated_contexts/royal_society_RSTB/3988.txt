The Endocardial Lining as a Whole. Two facts of chief importance seem to be established. (1) The lining of the
ventricular wall is always activated before the pericardial surface, and our results
show that the interval between the internal and external activity is controlled by
the thickness of muscle at the corresponding point. A simple muscular spread of the
excitation wave from within outwards, with uninterrupted penetration of the several
muscle layers accounts for the phenomena observed. (2) The internal surface is
supplied at a very early period of the ventricular cycle, and at a number of points
activity appears almost simultaneously. The earliest region to be activated, of which
we can speak positively from direct observation, is the area supplied by the early
outgoing branches of the right bundle division ; other regions, as will presently be
understood, are even earlier, and it is suspected, both from anatomical studies and
from solitary direct leads, that the lining of the left side of the septum is in reality
the first to be involved in the ventricle as a whole.
