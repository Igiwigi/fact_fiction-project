As regards the nuclei of the slime, two possible origins present themselves,
'@ From the nuclei of the vesicles of the club cells ; (2) From the nuclei of the fibro-

ts. Bdize is, unfortunately, no help in coming to a decision between these two possible
squrces of origin, though it at once enables one to state that these slime nuclei are
ngt those of epidermic scales, for the latter are far larger than the former. ‘pol aT TINGER (8) noted in Petromyzon that the extruded club cells did not contain a
ngeleus, and the fact is evident enough in the fibre masses of the cells in the Eel. ‘Fhe nucleus of the original club cell passes away in the escape cell, or mass, and as
Eis is absent as such from the slime, it must break up upon extrusion, and its nucleus
‘e set free.
2 As regards the other possibility, origin from fibroblasts, I have not observed that,
iader “normal” conditions, these reach the surface.
