This implies that on long waves, where the
attenuation is much less than for short waves, the gain for a given height is less. This is
found to follow from the more detailed analysis for points below | r,|. Physically this
corresponds to the fact that the edge of the diffraction shadow gets more ill defined as
the wave-length increases. The above argument provides a limit to the practical application of the height-gain
analysis. From (5:14) we see that /, is proportional to | p |, and therefore increases for
the higher terms of the diffraction formula.
