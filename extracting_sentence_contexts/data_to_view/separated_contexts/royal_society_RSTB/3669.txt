In short, I think we must admit
that the pineal eye of Sphenodon is no longer at the summit of its career as a light-
percipient organ, but the indications of degeneration in structure are very slight, not
approaching in degree those which are exhibited by the degenerating lateral eyes of
the blind fishes above referred to. It is impossible for me to believe that an organ
which retains such a complex histological structure, which is provided even in the
adult (as we shall see presently) with a well-developed nerve and an abundant supply
of ganglion-cells, and which occupies a position where it is actually exposed to light,
can be entirely functionless, and this view is further supported by the fact that it is. provided with a special artery of its own, and, above all, by the fact that the over-
lying connective tissue (parietal plug) is very specially modified to form a transparent
light-transmitting organ. There can, of course, be no question of the formation of
definite images; the irregular arrangement of the scales above the parietal plug
entirely precludes such a possibility ; but the organ still seems well adapted for the
perception of variations in the intensity of the light, and may perhaps still be of use
under conditions of which we are entirely ignorant. . That light actually does pass
through the integument above the parietal plug, and a“ this plug itself, I have
proved by direct observation.
