‘Turre exists,” so far as we know, no research in which the effects upon the circulation
and respiration produced by a bullet passing through the cerebral hemispheres have
been investigated. We have for this reason conducted a number of experiments in
which etherised animals—dogs—have been shot with bullets of various calibre, the
blood-pressure (central and peripheral), respiratory, and other curves being written
before and after the shot. The results we obtained almost immediately were so clear
and decisive, as well as contrary to generally received opinions on this subject, that
the questions involved appeared to us worthy of prolonged investigation, of which the
following is an account.

lt has long been recognised that the fatal influence of the projectile may be
exerted immediately or tardily : in fact, that we may speak of a primary source, and
a secondary source, of death respectively. We may anticipate what follows by
saying that we have found, as the result of an extensive series of experiments, that
the primary cause of death is not as previously supposed, arrest of the heart by
so-called shock, but that it consists in a sudden cessation of the movements of
respiration, which, however, can be artificially restored. It will be seen that the
conclusions derived from these observations have an unforeseen bearing on the proper
method of clinically dealing with this condition.

As we have above stated, we are not aware of any researches in which direct
observation of the pulse and respiration has been made at the time of the infliction of
