e ‘Perhaps I can best describe my experience of doing Mathematics in terms of a journey
through a dark unexplored mansion. You enter the first room of the mansion and it is
completely dark. You stumble around bumping into the furniture, but gradually you
learn where each piece of furniture is. Finally, after six months or so, you find the light
switch, you turn it on, and suddenly it’s all illuminated. You can see exactly where you
were. Then you move into the next room and spend another six months in the dark.
So each of these breakthroughs, while sometimes they’re momentary, sometimes over
a period of a day or two, they are the culmination of—and couldn't exist without—the
many months of stumbling around in the dark that precede them.’ Andrew Wiles [29].

e ‘Being a professional mathematician, in my work I constantly have to rely not on proofs,
but on feelings, guesses and conjectures, in passing from one fact to another by a special
kind of revelation that forces you to perceive common features in phenomena that
might seem completely unrelated to an outsider. A correct guess is accompanied by the
conviction that makes any further proofs completely unnecessary, an almost excruciating
feeling, that you can never forget, but which is very difficult to communicate to others.’
Vladimir Arnold [14].

e ‘When I’m working I sometimes have the sense—possibly the illusion—of gazing on
the bare platonic beauty of structure or of mathematical objects, and at other times I’m

3In this connection, the second anonymous referee raised the following extremely important point. The real concern of
Mathematics is not truth, but effectivity, and so the real question to ask is not why Mathematics is so ‘exceptionally reliable’,
but why it is so ‘unreasonably effective’. Overall, I concur with that. In the controversy of Physics vs Logic I stand with
