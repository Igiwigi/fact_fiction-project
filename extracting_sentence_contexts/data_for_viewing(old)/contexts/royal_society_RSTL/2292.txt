the interval was rendered sufficiently sxmall. The experiment demonstrates the direct
production of the electric spark from pure chemical forces.

958. There are a few circumstances connected with the production of this spark by
a single pair of plates, which should be known, to ensure success to the experiment.
When the amalgamated surfaces of contact are quite clean and dry, the spark, on
making contact, is quite as brilliant as on breaking it, if not even more 80. When
a film of oxide or dirt was present at either mercurial surface, then the first spark
was often feeble, and often failed, the breaking spark, however, continuing very
constant and bright. When a little water was put over the mercury, the spark
was greatly diminished in brilliancy, but yery regular both on making and breaking
contact. When the contact was made between clean platina, the spark was also very
small, but regular both ways. The true electric spark is, in fact, very small, and
when surfaces of mercury are nsed, it is the combustion of the metal which produces
the greater part of the light. The circumstances connected with the burning of the
mereury are most favourable on breaking contact ; for the act of separation exposes
clean surfaces of metal, whereas, on making contact, a thin film of oxide, or 80il-
ing matter, often interferes. Hence the origin of the general opinion that it is only
when the contact is broken that the spark passes.

959. With reference to the other set of cases, namely, those in which chemical affint.y
is exerted (947.), but where no transference of the power to a distance takes place, and
where no electric current is produced, it is evident that forces of the most intense kind
must be active, and in some way balanced in their activity, during such combinations ;
these forces being directed s0 immediately and exclusively towards each other, that no
