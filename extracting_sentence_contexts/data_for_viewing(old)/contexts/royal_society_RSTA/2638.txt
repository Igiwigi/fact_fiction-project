]. Introduction

Ostracods are generally small (usually less than 5mm) crustaceans with a shrimp-like body that
is totally enclosed within a bivalved carapace or shell. Within the myodocopan ostracod suborder
Myodocopina, many species possess a well-developed pair of compound eyes in addition to
naupliar eyes, which occupy up to a quarter of the body size in some species (e.g. Lowrya
(Cypridinidae) males; [1]). In fact, vision has played an important role in the evolution of at least
the family Cypridinidae, over a period of around 350 Myr, during which bioluminescence and
iridescence have provided significant behavioural functions [2,3]. However, these ostracods face
a challenge not common to animals and not previously considered in the literature—they must
see through their shells.

The cypridinid genus Macrocypridina represents ostracods that are unusual for their size and
lifestyle—they are large (about 5-10 mm long), pelagic and active predators. Also, species of this
genus tend to possess highly pigmented, dark brown or red shells, probably to reduce detection
by larger, visually guided predators in an environment where red/brown light is rare. While
examining specimens from this genus, gaps in the pigmentation of the shells became evident,
where approximately round, clear ‘windows’ were formed in the positions covering the line of
sight of the eyes; these windows are the subject of this study.
