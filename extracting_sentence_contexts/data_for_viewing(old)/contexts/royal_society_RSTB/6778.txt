ibs TopoGRAPHy, HISTORY AND METHOD

The area dealt with is a bay on the western margin of the fen between Peterborough
and Farcet on the north, and the village of Woodwalton, 6 miles north of Huntingdon,
on the south (fig. 1). This basin is about 6 miles (10 km.) across from north to south,
and lies open to the main fen region on the north-east side. The surrounding country
consists of low gentle hills of Oxford clay, largely covered with boulder clay, and so
disposed that they form a low ridge, close round the basin. They enclose a very small
river-catchment area, from which no streams of any size drain into the basin. This is a
feature of importance in interpretation of the vegetational history of the area, as is
also the low lime content of the boulder clay and the fact that the more calcareous
Jurassic strata (oolites, etc.) outcrop only west of the watershed.

The region has been notable for the occurrence in it, until recent times, of several
large fenland ‘“‘meres”’ of which the best known were Whittlesey, Ugg and Trundle
Meres, with Ramsey and Benwick Meres not far to the east. These were all very
shallow lakes, of which fair historical records persist. The largest, Whittlesey Mere, was
the second largest fresh-water lake in England, and was famous for sailing and skating.
It was drained in 1851, and the landowner, Mr Wells, has left a valuable account of
conditions before draining and observations on the effects of this draining. The other
meres appear to have been drained in the years just before.
