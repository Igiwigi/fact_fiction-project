We investigate numerically how the spatio-temporal behaviour of (2.2) changes as we increase
y(0). In the example in figure 2a, we observe that for y(0) = 0.2 the difference of up- and down-drift
of the solution is smaller, and coarsening occurs at a later time. This suggests that as we increase
y(0) the difference between up- and down-drift further decreases. We show this numerically in
figure 2c,d. In fact, the values of the up- and down-drift change continuously until they coincide
at the balance point y(0) = 6 ~ 0.514 (figure 2e). For larger values, the order of the drifts is reversed
and coarsening leads to another ‘winning’ phase of the solution (figure 2d).

Note that throughout this process of the change of y(0), the function fr satisfies (H1) and
(H2), and as a result fy satisfies (H3). It is now intuitively clear that close to the balance point
system (1.1) and (1.2), as a (small) perturbation of (2.2), exhibits a long transient solution with
initial conditions close to the balance point. In fact, in the next section, we provide strong
arguments in favour of these solutions not being mere transients any more, but delay-induced
switched states. We conjecture that conditions (H1)-(H3) are necessary conditions on f to allow
for such states.

3. Main result: balance point and delay-induced switched states

As we will show in §4, all solutions of (1.1) and (1.2) for 7 >0 that are not converging to or
identically zero are oscillating, i.e. its first component possesses infinitely many sign changes for
t > 0 (propositions 4.1 and 4.2). We are interested in oscillatory solutions that satisfy the following
definition motivated by the spatio-temporal plot in figure 2c.
