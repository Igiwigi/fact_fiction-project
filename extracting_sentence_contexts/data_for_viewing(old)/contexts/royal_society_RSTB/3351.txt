Represent a different Flora from that of the Coal Balls.—That the plants petrified
in the roof nodules represent a flora of a different character from that of the “coal
ball” plants has been remarked on several occasions (Scorr, March, : 06, p. 1, and
October, : 06, p. 148, Sropes, May, : 06, p. 18), and, as Scorr points out, has in several
respects a Permian facies, although undoubtedly being of Lower Coal Measure age.

The number of actual species which are confined to either the “ roof nodules” or
the “coai balls” is not so great, as will be seen from the following lists, but in
addition to them are found plants which are common in the roof and rare in the
seam, or which abound in the seam and are very scarce in the roof.

Owing to the relative scarcity of roof nodules containing plants, and to the fact
that a given roof nodule will contain but one species, while a “coal ball” may
contain 20, the number of plants which are recorded from the roof is relatively small
as compared with those from the seam.
