EVALUATION OF ZEROS OF HIGH-DEGREE POLYNOMIALS _ 395

If the coefficients of the transformed polynomial g(x) are denoted by 4,, then from equation
(2:3) we obtain
b, = a"-25 (n | s)2—2(n| s—1) (n|s+1)+2(n|s—2) (n|s+2)—...]. (3-12)

Now since the zeros of g(x) are all equal to —a?, the sum of the terms in the squared bracket
in equation (3-12) must equal (n|s). If—1>s>1, some individual terms are consider-
ably greater than (n|s), showing that if the process were performed numerically partial
cancellation would take place; in fact, since (n | s)?>(n|s—r) (n|s+r) ifr>0, the number
of leading figures which cancel is approximately equal to the number of digits in (n| 5)
itself. Further transformations produce the same effect.

Returning to the general polynomial of the nth degree, there is no reason to suppose that
Ssystematic cancellation will occur when the zeros are widely separated, and the inference
Sis that it takes place only when some zeros are either equal or close together in the complex
plane. This is verified in practice. Even with a few moderately close zeros some cancellation
usually occurs during the early transformations. The discussion above indicates the
Ymaximum amount of cancellation that can happen in the worst cases. For example, not more
‘than three figures should be lost per transformation if n<12; the corresponding limits for
Sfour and five figures being n<15, 19 respectively. Unless some of the zeros are actually
Bequal these maximum values will be attained, if at all, only in the early transformations,
