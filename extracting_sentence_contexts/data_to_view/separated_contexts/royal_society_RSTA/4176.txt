Epochs marked as artefact-corrupted were tagged and, after
visual inspection, definitively discarded [75]. ‘Bad’ channels identification refers to the detection
of low-quality EEG signal, frequent unexpected events and presence of high-frequency noise [73]. To this aim, for each channel, we calculated the second-, third- and fourth-central moments and
identified the ‘bad’ channels as the outliers present in such a three-dimensional space. Good
channels, in fact, usually cluster together, whereas the bad ones drift apart in different directions
according to their artefactual nature (for example, channels highly contaminated by the power- =
line have lower kurtosis than other channels). For each dimension of this space, channels distant :
more than twice the interquartile range from the cluster centroid were classified as artefactual
and, after visual inspection, were discarded. nee)

The ECG signal was analysed off-line to extract the RR intervals [41]. Firstly, ECG was pre-filtered [3S
through a moving average filter in order to extract and subtract the baseline.
