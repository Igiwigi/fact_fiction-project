arietal bands, they have a peculiar texture and are somewhat different in colour. After
Sreaching the genitalia their character is a little changed, they having assumed the ap-
Spearance of being formed by the membrane snspending these organs, as if they had
Hecome mere channels left within the two layers composing it. This is also the character
Â»f the branchio-systemic vein, which seems to be nothing more than a space left between
-Zhe layers of the mesenteric membrane, though, as it approaches the heart, it has pro-
Sably proper walls. The efferent brachial canal has all the appearance of being formed
Sy a duplicature of the lining membrane of the great brachial canal; but in Linguls it is
-2xcavated in the substance of the brachial ridge. There can be little doubt, however,
hat the vessels which have been termed afferent brachial arteries, those vessels which
Alrain the great brachial plexus and pass up the cirri, have true walls.
S This latter fact seems to favour the opinion that the lacunes themselves may have
roper walls, and that all these channels are connected from end to end with the central
grgans by continuity of tissue ; to fayour, in fact, Joann HuNTER's views with regard to
Ahe blood-sinuses in the lower animals. I have failed, however, to discover any such
Fontinuity of tissue demanded by the hypothesis of our great anatomist. If such had
Sany other than a hypothetical existence, it ought, one would think, to be demon-
Strable in the Terebratulida ; for perhaps in no other molluscous animal are the peri-
Apheral blood-channels 80 beautifully displayed, and, from the peculiarity of their arrange-
ment, 80 easily submitted to examination by even the highest powers of the microscope.
'The tissues are very transparent, and the blood-channels or lacunes most distinctly de-
fined; the only problem being, are these latter lined with a membrane? They contain
apparently cellular tissue ; does the membrane of continuity thread the meshes of this
tissne? or may the tissue itself turn out to be the required walls? These questions must
