If the globe were absent, the radius of its inner
Surface would become 7(1 —et,). It is, however, obliged to remain of radius 7, and
& must, therefore, be stretched. Assuming the stretching to be uniform throughout
fhe shell, and expressing the fact that the volume of the shell after cooling ¢,° is
Equal to its original volume multiplied by 1 — 3et,, it will be found that the radius of

2 Proceeding in a similar manner with the other shells, and remembering that the
