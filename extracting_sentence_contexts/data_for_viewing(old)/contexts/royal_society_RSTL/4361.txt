The German authors of standard works on comparative anatomy, with the excep-
tion of MgckeL*, have manifested no such general acquiescence in the views of
Georrroy ST. HiLaiks, as that which characterises those of our countrymen above-
cited. Carvs, for example, originally regarded the immoveable * costal plates ' of the
carapace as much-developed transvyerse processes, and the thorax of the Tortoise to
be * only a more perfect development of the ribless and imperfect thorax of the
Frog+;”—a view, however, in which his able English translator does not concurf;
and which Carus himself abandons in the second edition of his work. He there
states that the remarkable and anomalous skeleton of the trunk of the Chelonia may
be explained by recognising how certain plates belonging primitively to the dermal
skeleton are applied or adapted to the vertebrz, the ribs and the sternumy: the idea,
however, is neither explained in detail nor supported by any fact of development, but
is rather obscured by such fancies, as that the bodies of the vertebrz of the carapace
are not formed, as usual, on the under side, but on the upper side of the vertebral
column in the place of the spinous processes, which Carvs affirms not to exist ||.

Dr. Perzrs©| adopts the view that the carapace includes dermal pieces besides the
vertebre and ribs; and that the plastron consists of a subdivided sternum enlarged
by combination with ossified parts of the integument.

Professor Wacxx has given us an opportunity of judging of the sense in which he
