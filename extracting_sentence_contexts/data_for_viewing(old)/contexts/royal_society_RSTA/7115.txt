spindle was attached a flanged bush which was spring-loaded, thus forcing the needle on
to its seat. A slight axial clearance was allowed between the flange and the armature to
ensure that the valve was seated when at rest. This clearance could be varied by placing
washers between the nozzle and the gas chamber, best results being obtained with a
clearance of 0-005 in. A greased neoprene washer prevented the corrosive sampled gas
from passing into the solenoid chamber.

The valve was operated by the solenoid, the sequence of operations being as follows:
The discharge of a bank of condensers sent a direct current through the solenoid. This set
up a magnetic flux across the armature which, by reason of the fact that the circumferential
serrations on the armature were slightly out of line with those on the solenoid wall, caused
the armature to rise, so striking the flange of the spindle and lifting the needle from the
