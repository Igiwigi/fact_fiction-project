ciation were required in the model. When the generation
length was relatively long, relaxation of the system to a
higher global diversity became a more gradual process as
the biological system moves more slowly. When generation
length was shorter, so that the biological system moves
much faster than the underlying geological changes, species
richness was observed to peak and then decrease again to a
new equilibrium over time. This ‘overshoot’ pattern of diver-
sity through time has been observed in spiders on the
Hawaiian islands by performing space for time substitutions
[43]. It has also been recorded in simulation models of diver-
sification [44]. In our model, the observed overshoot is caused
by the fact that after the continents split apart, species rich-
ness shoots up because of the relatively fast pace of the
biological system and the increased net diversification rates.
After this, continents drifting further apart result in less dis-
persal between them and hence fewer opportunities for
speciation and declining equilibrium species richness.

There is significant potential for further work extending
these models. The spatial structure of regions within conti-
nents could be taken into account thus relaxing the rather
strong assumption that individuals are well mixed within
continents. Such a model would have the effect of increasing
N in equations (2.1)—(2.4), because N would correspond to
