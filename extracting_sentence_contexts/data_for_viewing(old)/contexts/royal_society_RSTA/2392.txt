much smaller than the system size. This interpretation, however, seems irreconcilable with the
absence of detectable upper cut-off in the distributions of AE burst energies in ice crystals, and
with the independence of these distributions with the applied stress (figure 3). This tuned-critical
scenario has also been challenged by two- and three-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics
(DDD) simulations that argued for a system-spanning correlation length at any applied stress,
but an average avalanche size exponentially growing with this stress [67,108]. It has also been
proposed that plasticity could be interpreted as a critical yielding transition, but with a critical :
point (yielding point) constantly moving as the material strain hardens, thus explaining how :=
intermittent dynamics and critical features are observed over a large range of stress [109]. This Ds
scenario, however, cannot explain dislocation avalanche dynamics in ice single crystals, which do :3

This discussion illustrates the fact that, much like for earthquakes [71], the nature of the 8
criticality of plastic deformation remains a lively question. : w

Beyond this debate, we have seen in ยง3 that the intermittency and wildness of ice plasticity Ss
appears as an extreme case (figure 7), as the crystal structure (e.g. FCC instead of hexagonal),

the system size, the introduction of extrinsic disorder (solutes, precipitates) or GBs may
fundamentally alter the collective dynamics.

It was mentioned that multi-slip plasticity, allowing the emergence of dislocation sub-
structures, i.e. of an intrinsic disorder, as well as large system sizes and extrinsic disorder, all
