On the one hand, variation in

brain patterns affects a childâ€™s susceptibility to displaying certain behaviours

should the setting invite them. Because most investigators assume that vari-

ation in brain chemistry or anatomy, inherited or acquired during gestation,

is the basis of most temperaments, it is reasonable to suggest the existence of

human brains vary in the concentrations of more than 150 molecules and in the
densities and locations of the varied receptors for each of these molecules. These
patterns have not been discovered. However, none of these brain profiles
generates only one class of behaviour.
