77. 1st. Correspondence in Size between the Celleeform Nucleus of the Nucleated Cell
and the © Red Corpuscle.” —Whilst, as we have seen, there is a marked difference in size
between the nucleated cell and the © red corpuscle” of the same blood, there is on
the contrary a striking correspondence in size between the cellzeform nucleus of the
nucleated cell and the © red corpuscle.” A glance at the figures will show this. In
human blood, in which the © red corpuscle” is large, the cellzeform nucleus of the
nucleated cell is large. In the blood of the Horse, in which the © red corpuscle” is
less; the cellzeform nucleus of the nucleated cell is also less. Again, in Sheep's blood,
in which the © red corpuscle” is till less, the cellzeeform nucleus of the nucleated cell
is 8till less.

78. These facts, and the fact already pointed out by Mr. Guiurves, that the nucleus
of the red nucleated corpuscle of the blood of the early mammiferous embryo is about
the same size as the © red corpuscles” in the same blood, which are similar to those of
the fully-formed blood of the animal, were sufficient to draw my attention to the
correspondence in size between the cellzxform nucleus of the nucleated cell and the
* red corpuscle,” but not sufficient to satisfy me that it was more than a coincidence.
I therefore became desirons of testing further the correspondence; and for this
purpose it occurred to me that the blood of the Elephant (in which the © red cor-
puscles” are larger than those of any mammiferous animal, as Mr. GuLLrveR has

women especially.
