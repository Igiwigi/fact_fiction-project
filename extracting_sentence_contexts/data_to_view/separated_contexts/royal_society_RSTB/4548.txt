An examination has also been made of the intestinal Protozoa ; five
species of these, or allied organisms, have been met with, and two, pertaining to the
genera Trychonympha and Trichomonas, are described as new. The second portion of the paper is devoted to a discussion of the more impor tant
general biological problems associated with the Isoptera and their relationships with
other insects. Particular mention may be made of the subject of polymorphism
and the various theories which have been advanced to account for the facts observed. A provisional hypothesis, based upon the Mendelian inheritance of mutations, is
suggested as a possible explanation of the phenomena associated therewith. The
presence of intestinal Protozoa among the wood-feeding Termites is also fully
discussed, and I have endeavoured to show that most of these organisms are more
probably symbiotic, rather than parasitic, in their relations with their hosts.
