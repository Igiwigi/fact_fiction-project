n-pentane are polarized (Herz et al. 1946) suggests that the symmetry class combination is
(A,, A,), though the same reservations apply to this evidence as those discussed for the
1060 cm~! series. This interpretation implies that the symmetry class of the 1155 cm~!
frequency in propane is 4,. A similar conclusion has been reached from investigations
of the spectra of symmetrically deuterated propanes and the application of the product
rule (McMurry & Thornton 1951).

(vi) The 890 cm! infra-red series

As has already been noted, a fifth series can be picked out in the infra-red spectra which
has frequencies active for all n; this occurs near 890 cm~ for large values of n and can be
traced back to a strong absorption band at 951 cm! in the spectrum of n-butane (figure 2).
The fact that this series cannot be associated with any band in the spectrum of propane
would at first suggest that it should not be considered here. However, one of the expected
infra-red frequencies of propane of symmetry B, has not been observed, presumably
because of overlapping with the frequency of another mode (Sheppard & Simpson 1953).
Earlier work has shown that the 951 cm~! absorption band of n-butane has a type C contour
corresponding to symmetry A, (Gates, 1949; Brown et al. 1950) and the infra-red polariza-
tion data on n-nonadecane show that the corresponding frequency (at 890 cm~!) arises
from a perpendicular vibration, i.e. A, or B,. The only possible symmetry class combination
for this series consistent with all these data is thus (B,, A,) (see table 2).

(vii) General discussion

The experimental evidence cited in the previous section shows that the symmetry class
