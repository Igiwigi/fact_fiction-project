To summarise :

(1) Kramers’ forrtula is a good approximation when the energy of the absorbing
electron is small.

(2) Mitne’s calculation of the absorption by bound electrons is an overestimate.

(3) These results are unfavourable to a high opacity. OppENHEIMER’s high value is
due to a mistake.

(4) For very low frequencies the absorption coefficient is even greater than KRAMERS’ ;
but this fact is not of importance.

(5) For very high frequencies the absorption coefficient is less than Kramers’. This
result is to be found in an earlier paper by OpPENHEIMER.*

(6) It is suggested that in work on absorption lines the coefficient for the continuous
background should be that corresponding to the frequency of the line, and not a mean
over the whole spectrum. ‘his affects the variation of the absorption coefficient with
temperature. Thus Kramers’ formula (6.10) yields k « P/T®* (where P is the electron
pressure), when both v and v are averaged suitably to the temperature ; but if v is
kept constant k « P/T**.
