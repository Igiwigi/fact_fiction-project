is shown elsewhere that at least in some cases where the interlamellar septa are
alternately high and low (e.g., Zutraria), the low septa have median vertical blood-
tubes, which fork at the upper border of the septum, and one limb of the tube is
continued up the ascending and one up the descending lamella (see remarks on
intraplical blood-tubes on p. 175). One might, indeed, be tempted to propound the
hypothesis that plication is the outcome of the failure of the incomplete or low septa

to hold the two lamelle together, were it not for the disturbing fact that there are
many plicate gills (eg., that of Lutraria just mentioned) which have_ the inter-
lamellar septa of the plical bases alternately high and low; which have, in other
words, their low septa related to plical bases and not to plical apices.
