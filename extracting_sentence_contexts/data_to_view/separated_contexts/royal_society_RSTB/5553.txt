Dimensions —The specimens used for cultures were about 15 mm. diameter. The
species apparently becomes sexually mature at about 12 mm. and attains a maximum
size of about 25 mm. diameter. Remarks.—This is a species very closely allied to Molgula tubifera, and in fact
HarrMeyer included this last-named species and others within Molgula manhattensis. Development.—The development is remarkedly similar to that of M. tubifera, in the
nature and size of the tadpole, the outgrowth of a long primary ectodermal ampulla,
and in the size of the egg and associated structures. This may be seen by comparing
