of manganese. A feature present in all the curves may some day hays &
bearing on the molecular theory of magnetism. Tb is this : the ascending curve tw1Ce
croszes the continuation of the descending curve; in other words, the fact that a
ample has been strongly magnetised in a reverse direction, renders it for small forces,
or for large forces, more difficult to magnetise than a virgin sample, but distinetly
casier for intermediate forces. This is best seen in the case of the hardesb steel,
No. IX., fig. 9, in which the two curves ent in the points marked M, N. A similar
phenomenon has been observed and investigated by G. WIEDEMANN (vide Â© Die Lehre

vom Galyanismus,' first edition, vol. ii., p. 340, et 8eg.).
