and the activity of the vital actions regulate the production of urea.

The following is a 7&ume of the principal facts which are contained in the preceding
communication â€”

1. The inquiry was intended to show the changes normally proceeding in a healthy

2. The inquiry upon myself was continued during [two years and two months, and
embraced 635 days, and more than 1400 analyses for urea. ]

3. The average daily evolution of urea was 519 grs. [on the average of two years
500 grs.], and the proportion to each 1b. of body-weight was 2:73 grs. The extremes
