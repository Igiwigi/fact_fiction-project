In the last two experiments the endiometer was heated by hot glycerin in the jacket.

These additional experiments confirm the previous series ; a change of initial tem-
perature greatly influences the division of the oxygen. But they also bring to light a
very important fact. The coefficient of affinity does not materially alter when the
temperature is raiged from 60? to 120%. The coefficient found at these two tem-
peratures in the second series is als0 the same as that found at 60? in the firs series.
The two sets together show a progressive diminution of the coefficient as the el
perature is raised from —10* to 60* and a nearly constant value between 60* and 120".

Another mixture was now made containing about three times as much hydrogen as
carbonie oxide ; portions of this mixture were exploded successively under 1000 rolllirna,
pressure at; 0, 70*, 80” and 100%. A nearly similar mixture was exploded at 125.
