A sequence of high-speed photographs of the impact of a 1 mm diameter steel sphere at normal
incidence on a block of Pyrex glass at 160m-s~! is shown in figure 3. The impact occurs between
frames 2 and 3 and the ensuing cracks in the Pyrex glass block formed approximately 0.1-0.2 rs
before the end of exposure in frame 3. The uncertainty in the moment of contact is due to the
fact that, at a framing rate of 1 j1s per frame, the exposure time of each frame is one-sixth of the
interframe time. It will be seen in frame 3 that a cone crack of a semi-included angle of 43.5Â°
has already formed just below the contact between the projectile and the glass and its length, as
measured along the skirt of the cone, is approximately 0.35 mm. Therefore, the velocity of this
cone crack is 3500-1800 ms*~1.
