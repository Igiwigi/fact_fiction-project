Its diamagnetic anisotropy may, to a first approximation, be
taken to be equal to (” + 1) times that of B, and may be corrected for, as in § IX. The remaining part of the anisotrepy would then represent the sum of the Stark
and the interaction anisotropies (A(z), and (Ay); say. We can now use the fact
that (Az), should be independent of magnetic dilution of the kind considered, while
(Ay); should rapidly diminish with dilution, in order to separate the two.
