also be present. These facts, together with the volatility of Tl,O, probably account
for the potency of thallium as an “ anti-knock.”” BLUumMENTHAL* has measured the
dissociation pressure of K,O, and K,O,; which at 450° C are about 300 and 20 mm,
respectively, so that both oxides would be present under engine conditions. There
is no evidence of the existence of Na,O; above 290° as a product of Na,Oy,.
Krustinsons} states that in the range 350° to 308° CG, the dissociation pressure of pure
lead peroxide changes from 914 mm to 90 mm, so that the peroxide would not be
present, except in solid solution, at high temperatures ; the product of dissociation
is not pure PbO, and as Pb,O, has only a small dissociation pressure at 400° C,
it is probable that several oxides of lead are capable of existing at the temperatures
in the engine. ,

These facts and all the experiments described are in line with former con
clusions§ :—

(1) that the “ anti-knock”’ has to be oxidized ; (2) that it should be dispersed so
as to be almost asa vapour ; and (3) that it should be capable of being oxidized to
a higher oxide.

While a certain amount is known about the dissociation of metal alkyls, the
information as to their oxidation is limited. Lead tetraethyl vapour along with air
passed through a heated tube commenced to oxidize rapidly at 280° C, and gave
white, yellow, buff and brown deposits. The brown deposits were partly PbO,
but after washing with pentane to remove any excess PbEt,, part of the reddish-
brown deposit still gave off volatile compounds explosively and corresponded to the
