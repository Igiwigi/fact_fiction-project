In the present paper
I have examined in some detail the special cases corresponding to the values 1 and 2
for s, and the approximation is found to be equally rapid, as will be seen from the
tables given hereafter. Consequently, in these cases at least, all except the two or
three smallest roots will be obtained with adequate accuracy by finding the roots
which lie in the stated intervals of the equations Li, = 0 with different integral
values of n.

The roots so found will not however form the complete series of roots of the
period-equation. We may in fact anticipate that the remaining roots of the equation
L;, = 0 will also approximate to roots of the period-equation, To obtain a better
approximation of the roots of this class, it will however be preferable to make use
of the period-equation in the form (57). As a first approximation we omit the
continued fractions and obtain

2os

Ni=0 or n(n+1)— 7 = 2. This method of approximation will be valid if when A/w = 2s/n(n + 1) the two
continued fractions involved in (57) are small in comparison with n(n+ 1).
