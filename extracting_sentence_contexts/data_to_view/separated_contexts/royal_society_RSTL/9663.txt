Anatomie,‚Äù p. 505), thab amongst living plants such cells are chiefly confined to the
medullary rays of Gymnosperms and especially to the Abietina,

plants acquire, through advancing age, those characteristics thab have hitherto been
relied upon to distinguish the Sigillarian from the Lepidodendroid forms.
