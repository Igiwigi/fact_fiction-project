is typical.

Each of these is a simple circular function; the results of the undulatory theory
are directly applicable to it.

The periods of the elementary vibrations have all values from zero to infinity.
Now, if the disturbance could be analysed: as a number of simple circular functions
with distinct periods, the separate elements would have meaning, as in the familiar
harmonic analyses of tides, vibrations of musical instruments, &c. The question we
have to answer is, have the simple elements meaning in the limit, when their number
is infinite, and the sum becomes an integral ?

§ 7. We will at once notice an obvious criticism; this was, in fact, offered by
Porncarh,t soon after Gouy’s article appeared. Each of the component vibrations
du(C cos ut + § sin ut) exists unchanged through all time. This is true whatever
be the nature of the disturbance we are analysing. But this disturbance may,
for instance, be zero, except within a certain definite interval of time. Take the case
of a flash of light. Now a spectroscope, says M. Porncart, will separate the
component vibrations laterally ; they may be examined separately. Hence a spectro-
scope will enable us to see the light for an infinite time before it is kindled, and for
an infinite time after it is extinguished. The analysis must therefore be fallacious.

The answer to this objection is as follows. No spectroscope possesses infinite
analysing power. A given point at the focus of the telescope will be illuminated by
light of a whole range of periods. Or, to look at the matter from another point of
