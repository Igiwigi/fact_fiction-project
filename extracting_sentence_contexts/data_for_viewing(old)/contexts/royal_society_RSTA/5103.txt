solid chemical elements across the first-row transition series.

Thus, two types of bands are usually employed in any discussions of the electronic structure
of the solid transition metals: namely a wide s-electron band which arises from the overlap of s
(and p) atomic states and a narrow, high-density d-electron band. The high density of d-electron
states of a transition metal makes for a large contribution to the magnetic susceptibility of certain
transition metals, and is essential for the ferromagnetism of Fe, Co and Ni. This is also important
for the occurrence of superconductivity in V, Nb and so on, as we will now illustrate [33].

5. Theoretical concepts

These high density of d states at the Fermi energy (figures 4 and 5) for many of the first-
row transition metals might be expected to make for a high electrical conductivity, but, in fact,
the reverse is true and they exhibit rather high electrical resistivity [2,3,31]. The acknowledged
explanation is that the d band is narrow and has to accommodate up to 10 electrons when
compared with the s bandâ€™s two [35]. In such bands, the 3d band, electrons move sluggishly
owing to their low itinerant electron mobilities and, interestingly, contribute little to the flow
of electric current in these metals at temperatures in their normal (non-superconducting) state.
Indeed, they appear to hinder any such mobility by providing many electronic states at the Fermi
energy into which the current-carrying s electrons can be scattered [30,32]. This feature of low
carrier mobility in the normal metallic state (i.e. T >> Tc) now appears as a characteristic feature of
all superconducting elements, and in figure 6 we show the data for a variety of superconducting
and non-superconducting chemical elements in the form of a log-log plot of measured electron
carrier densities versus electron mobilities.
