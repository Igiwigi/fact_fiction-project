The streaks
reach down towards the wall, where they are almost streamwise aligned, while they present some
wiggles close to the streamwise vortices. Moreover, their structures becomes almost identical on
the two walls, despite in the upper wall much weaker vortices are found (not shown). These unexpected differences with respect to the starting TW2 solution might arise from the
fact that, when continuing the PNS equations (2.1) towards the PRANS ones (2.2), invariant
perturbations of the laminar base flow transform into statistically coherent fluctuations of the
mean flow. Thus, the observed structural change of the travelling wave solution can be simply due
to the change of reference from the base to the mean flow, rather than to an intrinsic modification
of the coherent motion. An answer to this important point can be found by directly comparing
