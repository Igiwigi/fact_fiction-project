1. Correction for Thermal Expansion of the Vessel.â€”The volume of the sphere
increases during the experiment by the thermal expansion of the copper. The gas in
the sphere is not, in fact, maintained at absolutely constant volume. The thermal effect
of this on the added quantity of gas, W, is evidently that which is to be considered. The initial pressure due to W is affected negatively by the increased volume of the
sphere, positively by the rise of temperature.
