Hence we may state the result :

Tueorem VI.—If. in the two-dimensional problem, the tooth receives a pure translation,
the points of maximum and minimum pressure occur at the points where the membrane
is cut by a straight line, drawn parallel to the direction of the translation through the centre
of mass of the fictitious wire previously described. The pressure is a maximum or a
minimum according as the tooth approaches or recedes from the socket.

This result is illustrated in fig. 6, in which the arrows indicate the directions in
which the pressure increases.
