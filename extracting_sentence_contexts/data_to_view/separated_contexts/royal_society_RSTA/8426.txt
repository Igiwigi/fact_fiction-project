L. F. RICHARDSON: THEORY OF THE

The arbitrary constant is determined by the fact that at the beginning of the flight
da/dt = (muzzle-speed) x (cosine of angle between barrel and the « axis)

= uf, for Bisthiscosine . . . . . . . . (16)
Since we reckon ¢ and s to be zero at the vertex, this value of @ occurs when ¢ = —a,
where a is the time of ascent, and when s = —1, where / is the maximum height attained. When the arbitrary constant has been removed from (15) in this way, we obtain

Now, the observer aims to make the returning ball hit the shelter which protects the
gun, and if he does not quite succeed, he corrects the tilt to correspond to this condition,
which in symbols is

x=0 when t=b, the time of descent. . . . . . (21)
This condition converts (20) into the following “ integral equation,”

The unknown speed & is now removed, and it remains to find vx from 8.
