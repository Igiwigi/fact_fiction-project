Secondly.—That this correlation appears to vary slightly from character to
character.
Thirdly.—That it does not appear to be absolutely the same for all species.

It is most unfortunate for this general theory of the pure gamete, that it throws
the Mendelian back into the position ef the biometrician of 1885.* One might have
hoped that the generality involved in » couplets would have led to the requisite
elasticity, or, failing this, to a numerical value of parental correlation nearer the
cluster point of existing measurements than 3. We can only say, at present, that a
generalised theory of the pure gamete leads to precisely the same general features of
regression as have been observed by the biometricians, but it appears numerically too
narrow to describe the observed facts.

(7.) Provostrion V.—To find the Standard Deviation of the Array of Offspring
due to Fathers with s-allogenic Couplets,

We have to find the standard deviation o, of the combination of binomials dealt
with in the previous proposition, Each component standard deviation must, of
course, be weighted with the total frequency of the component, and there must be
the proper reduction to the mean of the array as a whole.

The (i + 1)" binomial (4u + 4v)""‘ has V (n — 7) x FF for its standard deviation,
and the distance of its mean from the mean of the array
