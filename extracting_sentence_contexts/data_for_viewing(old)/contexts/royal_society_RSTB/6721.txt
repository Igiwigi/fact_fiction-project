(and sometimes anthers, or corolla tube) may contain anthocyanins differing from those in the rest of
the petals. Again, local stabilizing factors may be operative, Examples in Lathyrus odoratus are relevant
to degree of methylation, Co-pigment tends to concentrate in the wings of the flowers and cases have
been encountered in which the proportion of malyin to petunin is greater in the wings than in the
standards of the same flowers. We suggest that malvin forms a more stable compound with the flavonol
derivative than does petunin and that where flavonols are present the malvin, relatively to petunin,
is protected from destruction, This is confirmed experimentally by the observed greater effect of
co-pigments on malvin as compared with petunin.

are analogous to the Dazzler forms of Primula sinensis. This is in fact known to be so
in Papaver Rhoeas (Scott-Moncrieff 1936).

Therefore, subject to certain assumptions, the only conclusion which can be drawn
from the evidence of mixed anthocyanidin derivatives is that cyanidin is the antho-
cyanidin whose synthesis in the plant involves at least one stage less than that of either
pelargonidin or delphinidin (scheme C).

LEucO-ANTHOCYANINS

Since the colours of flowers and fruits, in attracting insects and birds, play an
important part in the reproduction of the species, it is clear that natural selection,
following upon variation, will operate to perpetuate and increase the number of
