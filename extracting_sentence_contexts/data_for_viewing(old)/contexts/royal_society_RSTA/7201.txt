which is in fact of the exact form of the Laplace transformation since the operator g now only
appears in the factor e~# of the integrand. Thus the interpretation of equation (49) may be
immediately written down as u(y, a) = I(Ay, €), (50)

We have now found that equation (50) gives a solution of the integral equation (30) when
v is the special case given by equation (44), i.e. we have obtained the relation
