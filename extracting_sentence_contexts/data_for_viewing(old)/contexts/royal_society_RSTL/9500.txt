dence of a class of phenomena on the relation between the density of the gas and the
dimensions of objects, owing to the presence of which the phenomena occur. As long
as the density of the gas is inversely proportional to the coarseness of the plate, the
transpiration results correspond ; and in the same way, although not 80 fully investi-
gated, corresponding phenomena of impulsion are obtained as long as the density of the
gas is inversely proportional to the linear 8ize of the objects exposed to its action. In
fact, the same correspondence appears with all the phenomena investigated.

We may examine this result in various ways, but, in whichever way we look at it,
it can have but one meaning. If in a gas we had to do with a continuous plenum
such that any portion must possess the same properties, we should only find the same
properties, however small might be the quantity of gas operated upon. Hence, in the
fact that we find properties of a gas depending on the size of the space in which it is
enclose d, and of the quantity of the gas enclosed in this space, we have proof that gas
is not continuous—or, in other words, that gas possesses a dimensional structure.

In virtue of their depending on this dimensional structure, and having afforded us
proof thereof, I propose to call the general properties of gas on which the phenomena
of transpiration and impulsion depend, the Dimensional Properties of Gases.

This name is also indicative of the nature of these properties as deduced from the
molecular theory ; for by this it appears that these properties depend on the mean
range—a linear quantity which, ceteris paribus, depends on the distance between the
molecules.
