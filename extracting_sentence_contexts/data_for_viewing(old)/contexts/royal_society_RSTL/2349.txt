most Ikely have been altogether lost sight of, had it not occurred again to Mr. Dot-
LOND b try its effect on the micrometer eyepiece for the Rev. Mr. Dawes. It is there-
fore toMr. DoLLoxp we are indebted for snatching this lens from the oblivion into
which Ihad allowed it to fall.

It myt not, however, be understood that it is only applicable to this eyepiece,
for it my be applied to any eyepiece, positive or negative, or to the erecting eye-

piece, or indeed to any telescope of fluid or glass, or to refractors ; for it is, in fact,
not a part of the eyepiece, but of the telescope itself: and it is for this reason its
advantages are 80 conspicuous in the application Mr. DoLLoxp has 80 ingeniously
made of it ; for by lengthening the focus before the rays arrive at the eyepiece, the
image is magnified, while the wires retain only their original size.

Having thus shown the origin of the negative achromatic lens, I may be allowed
to state the motives and reasonings which guided me in the computation of the
curves, and what appears to me to constitute the advantages it is found to pozess.
Notwithstanding the extreme difficulty there is in constructing an achromatic obect-
glass, yet with perfect materials the difficulty is only in the manipulation ; and this
being overcome, there is not 80 great a natural impediment to perfection in this 2art
as in the eyepiece, â€”for we know that it is impossible to make a perfect positive
