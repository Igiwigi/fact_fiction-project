they are not the outcomes of a repeated experiment. Decisions about saving
for future pension provision, for example, are difficult to make the subject
of experimentation, although we can learn from the experience of others.
People tend to follow the actions of others. That can be an effective
strategy. For example, on the game show ‘Who Wants To Be A
Millionaire?’, the ‘Ask the Audience’ lifeline has a 91 per cent success rate,
showing that there can be wisdom in crowds [18]. But experiments also
show that a substantial proportion of people choose a glaringly incorrect
answer to a simple question when told it is the answer others have chosen,
even though the same question is answered correctly in isolation (e.g. [19]).
In a sporting setting, goalkeepers facing penalties tend to dive, rather than
stay in the middle of the goal, more than the direction of penalties suggests
is appropriate [20]. Such types of behaviour reflect the fact that people are
unwilling to risk failure by pursuing strategies that are different from the
norm. The penalty of failure may be less if others fail in the same way—as
Keynes pointed out was true of banks.

People have excessive faith in their own judgements and are subject to
confirmation bias and wishful thinking. An experiment, well known in the
literature, asked respondents to report 90 per cent confidence intervals
around estimates of a set of unknown quantities (e.g. the diameter of

For example, see Palm [15], who found that those most affected by earthquakes were most likely
to take out insurance afterwards. But this effect faded as time elapsed after an earthquake.
