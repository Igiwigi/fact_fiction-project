A first step toward the determination of which of the
three above-stated alternatives is correct, consists in a thorough physiological and
morphological investigation, without reference to these theories, of the chromatophore-
system of the animals under consideration. If this has for a result the bringing to
light of facts incompatible with the theory that the pigments have and have only
a protective r√©le, it then becomes necessary to cast about in order to ascertain what
other function they possess,

We have taken the first step. In the course of our observations a number of
facts have come to light which are difficult of interpretation in terms of protection. The nocturnal blue colouration which, as we have described, is assumed by Hippolyte
varians and other Crustacea, cannot, as we conceive, be regarded as conferring any
protection on these animals. Hippolyte variuns, like all sympathetically coloured
animals, is in the highest decree sedentary ; as far as we know, it never migrates ;
nor would it, did it migrate through clear blue water, assume its nocturnal blue
colour.
