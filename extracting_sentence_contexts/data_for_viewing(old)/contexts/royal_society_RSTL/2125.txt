Should be produced where the soluble portion of a'stone has
been dissolved, and the insoluble particles are left projecting
from the surface ; and even stronger facts may be adduced.
Specimens are at all times to be obtained in which the shell has
been extensively acted on by others ; while the cuticle, which
had necessarily been exposed to the same agent, remains un-
injured, and overhanging the breach.

In MonTacv's Testacea Britannica, it is stated on the
authority of PuLTENEY, that Venerupis irus ( Donax irus of
Linnzvs) has been found in clay ; and the author affirms
that he himself possessed specimens of Mya pholadia in stones
not calcareous. Facts presenting $0 serious an exception to
the general habits of the animal to bore into lime, would be
fatal to the theory of a solvent, did they not admit of full
explanation. The young animals, in seeking a convenient
spot, almost invariably fix themselves in holes or crevices
which afford them immediate shelter. Hence, they are oc-
casionally found lodged among the roots of fuci; and they
will sometimes find a shelter in stone, upon which they are
unable to act. I have met once with a Mya distorta, and re-
peatedly with Saxicava rugosa and precisa, lodged in soft
argillaceous stone ; but in every such case | the hole had
clearly been made by a pholas, the remains of whose shells
were generally found in it more or less dissolved by the
