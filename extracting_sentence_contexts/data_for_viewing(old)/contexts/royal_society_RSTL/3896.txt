truth, had I, at the outset, expected they would have been requisite, I might probably
have been deterred from attempting s0 troublesome and lengthened an inquiry. At
first I imitated the apparatus of Mr. Crosss, already referred to (3.), the copper
cylinders being made water-tight that they might themselves constitute the cells;
and considering such insulation would be sufficient, I attached the cells to the boards
with sealing wax, poured into holes made in the boards for the insertion of each cell.
I found this arrangement answer very well for a few hundred series, but when the
number was augmented, and the battery completed, the insulation was sadly deficient.
This induced me to take the battery asunder, and to have distinct or separate glass
vessels made for each pair. After again completing the entire series, I found the
insulation was even less efficient than before; for from the glass attracting moisture
from the atmosphere, as well as from the eyaporation of the battery, each cell became
a conductor, and scarcely any effect could be produced on the electroscope; in fact,
it was not until I had finally adopted the arrangements I have previously described,
that any approximation to a tolerable insulation could be maintained.

7. The general appearance of the battery may be seen by referring to Plate I.
fig. 1, where A, A' represent the wooden frames, in which are placed the forty-four
boards containing the entire battery; B a sbelf on which a galvanometer can be
placed, or any other apparatus for the detection of a current or chemical action.
