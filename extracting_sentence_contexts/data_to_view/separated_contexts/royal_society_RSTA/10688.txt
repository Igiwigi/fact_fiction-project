At other
times the quantity of water in their channels is very small, though this stream was
never quite dry in the month of June when we saw it. A small body of water, black
as ink and thick with mud, was always flowing to the sea, steaming strongly and very
hot. It came in gushes which rushed down with a wave in front of them (see
Plate 23, fig. 2), several inches or a foot in’ height, and between these the current
was very slight and, in fact, almost ceased. It was not hot water but black boiling
mud, and the stronger rushes carried with them pebbles several inches in diameter. On one occasion, when we were returning from an ascent of the mountain, we found
one of the smaller streams, which we had crossed dryshod in the morning, so swollen
by heavy showers that it was flowing in a thick black current 2 or 3 feet deep and
several yards across.
