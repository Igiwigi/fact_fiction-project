The hypocentrum of the 2nd (absorbed) occipital vertebra is still plainly
visible (h.o. 2). Stage 5. 160 hours; figs. 40, 41, Plate 47.â€”The chief interest of this stage lies
in the fact that the trabecule have undergone further development. In the first place
they are joined together anteriorly, forming an ethmoid plate (e.p.) which constitutes
the anterior limit to the hypophysial fenestra (h.fe.). This fenestra is not yet com-
pletely enclosed, for the polar cartilages are still free from the acrochordal, but they are
attached, each to the hind end of the trabecula of its own side, by procartilage.
