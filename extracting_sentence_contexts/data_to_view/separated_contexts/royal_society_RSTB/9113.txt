A socially hostile environment
that increases risk for injury poses a threat of bacterial infec-
tion, which would favour upregulation of innate antibacterial
and T-helper 2 adaptive immune responses, and this is what
was seen [71]. The evolutionarily ancient plasmacytoid den-
dritic cells and monocytes, both antigen-presenting cells,
were the leucocytes of origin that were sensitive to loneliness
and contributed disproportionately to the loneliness dif-
ference in transcriptional expression [72]. The fact that an
age-old sensitivity has persisted to the present day speaks
to the ongoing importance of the social environment and
perceptions of inclusion or isolation for evolutionary fitness.

4, Implications for future research

In this review, we have focused on a considerable literature
documenting physiological and health consequences of lone-
liness in humans and have argued that these consequences
can impact an individual's fitness across the lifespan. One
of the most salient observations of this review, starkly evident
in table 1, is that research on the health consequences of
loneliness is most prevalent in older age groups, which is per-
fectly understandable given that this is the age at which
clinical disease and disability set in. However, many chronic
diseases of ageing have their origin in physiological disturb-
ances earlier in life that only gradually become manifest in
disease.
