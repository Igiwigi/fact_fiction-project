finally, the irregularity is regarded as an artifact—a result of the action of the fixing
reagent.

There are several facts which show that, for Antedon, the last explanation is the
correct one. In the first place the nuclear irregularity shows no spatial relation
whatever, either to the other cell-structures, to commencing yolk formation, or to the
position of the nucleus in the cell. In the second place, it is only in radial section
that the nuclear irregularity presents the appearance of Pseudopodia; in tangential
sections these nuclear “ processes” are found to invariably resolve themselves into
a coarse wrinkling of the nuclear membrane (figs. 68 and 69). Finally, the artificial
nature of the nuclear irregularity is strongly indicated by the variable behaviour of
the nucleus with varying fixation. Only in material fixed with sublimate is the
irregularity of the nucleus invariably well marked. With other reagents, eg.,
sublimate acetic, bichromate acetic, or Hermann’s fluid, the irregularity may be
much less marked or even entirely absent, and this is true even of material taken
from one and the same individual.
