ments of locomotion, are effected by means of pseudopodial prolongations of the
sarcode, put forth through apertures in the shell, and capable, when retracted again,
of coalescing with the general mass. In the case of the composite forms, he con-
sidered the entire animal to be made up of a series of segments which are essentially
repetitions one of another, each possessing an independent vitality of its own*.
'These statements have been subsequently confirmed and rendered more precise by
several other observers; their truth has been admitted by M. D'Orsiexy, who, in all
his recent works, has described the animals of the Foraminifera in accordance with
them (though without any allusion to the fact, that he had himself previously laboured
under an entire misconception of their character, and without any mention of the
A discoverer of their real nature) ; and they have been recently placed beyond all doubt,
by the admirable researches of Professor SCHULTZE (Op. cit.). It cannot but seem surprising, that notwithstanding tbe light thrown upon this
inquiry by M. Duaarpin in 1835, Professor ExrExBeRG should in 1838 have announced
E to the Academy at Berlin, his conclusion, professedly based on observations of
S certain forms of these animals in their living state, that their true place in the animal
Z kingdom is among the Bryozoa≈ø}.
