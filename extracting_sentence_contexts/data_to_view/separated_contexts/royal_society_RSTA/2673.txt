If b=1, the mean interevent time increases by a
factor of 10 for each unit change of magnitude. If there are 10 M > 3 earthquakes per year in the


region, on average there will be one M > 4 earthquake per year, a mean interval of 10 years for a
M2 5 earthquake, etc. This approach is, in fact, useful to provide a measure of the seismic hazard. However, seismic activity is in general time-dependent; aftershocks are a prime example. In this
paper, we illustrate how the concept of seismic nowcasting can be used to provide estimates
of the statistical hazard at the present time.
