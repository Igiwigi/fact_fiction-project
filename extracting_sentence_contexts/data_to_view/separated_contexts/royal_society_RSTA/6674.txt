STUDY OF THE HOPKINSON PRESSURE BAR 389

Equations (5-5) and (5-5a) give the relation between the p.d. V applied to the input
terminals of the amplifier, the change in capacity y of the bar condenser and the electrical
constants of the circuit. It is now necessary to find the relationship between y and the dis-
placement of the measuring end of the bar, and finally the equation connecting € with V
and the circuit constants.

(a) The parallel-plate condenser unit

Let D be the initial separation of the earthed and insulated plates of the bar condenser.
~q Then the initial capacity C, of the bar condenser is
Q
= C, = A(1+¢)/4nD, (5-6)

& distribution of the field between the plates due to the fact that the plates are not infinitely
@ close together.
™ At time ¢, the separation of the plates is (D —£), and the capacity C is therefore

S __It will be noticed that the sensitivity of this type of unit, i.e. the ratio of V to &, is not con-
stant unless AV is small in comparison with unity; this is often the case in practice, e.g. if
5 C,/C, = 100, E, = 600 V, V = 0-03 V, then AV = 0-005.

(b) The cylindrical condenser unit

] It will be assumed that the insulated cylinder of the condenser unit is adjusted initially
so as to ensure that there is no change in the end-effect during the displacement of the end
_ of the bar; this condition will be amply fulfilled if the measuring end of the bar projects into
the insulated cylinder to a distance which is five to ten times the difference in radius between
the bar and the cylinder. Under these conditions, the increase in the capacity of the bar
condenser will be proportional to the displacement &, so that if & is the capacity per unit
