where Kg is the zeroth modified Bessel function of the second kind. Figure 6a shows how the
classical rate varies with respect to the bias for the model system and we see that it fails to predict
the trend of the rate with respect to the product bias. Note also that the expression in equation
(4.14) spuriously tends to infinity when the crossing point energies Vrp and Vpp are equal.

Using the asymptotic relation Ko(z) ~ //2ze™* as z > 00, we can gain some useful insights
into the mechanism underlying the classical rate. When the quantity 6(Vpp — Vpp) is large (i.e.
for low temperatures and strong exothermic bias), the rate tends to an expression with the
exponential term e~/V88, and we identify Veg as the activation energy. In fact, the expression
reduces in this limit to the classical second-order rate (equation (2.23)) (for a reaction from R to B)
with a classical reactant partition function and an effective coupling given by

At the relatively low temperature of our problem, for which 6 ~ 90 eV |, this limit is valid across
all but the smallest exothermic biases considered. As for the SEC approximation, the classical
sequential mechanism leads to a rate expression which can be written as the second-order rate
with an effective coupling. However, in contrast to the SEC approximation, the effective second-
order rate corresponds to a transfer from R to B instead of R to P and thus has an activation energy
which is independent of exothermic bias. This explains why the predictions are contrary to the
