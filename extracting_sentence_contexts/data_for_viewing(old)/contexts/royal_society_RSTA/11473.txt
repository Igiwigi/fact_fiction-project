‘8 This thermometer is bent at right angles just above the bulb, and it is so suspended
2 alongside the interference tube that the small elbow carrying the bulb passes right
S into the interior of the interference chamber itself, without contact with any part of

g been taken to determine its fixed points from time to time; its capillary was a
& specially selected one, and its zero and boiling points have required only the minutest
3 corrections. It was so constructed that the 70° mark came just outside the bath, so

limit of 120° this correction is necessary, and to enable it to be made another much
A smaller thermometer was attached to the stem, with the bulb opposite to the 90°
mark, That the indications of this thermometer actuaily express the temperature of
the tripod and whatever it supports, is proved by the fact that the bands follow it
exactly, their motion being arrested simultaneously with that of the mercury column.
The importance of actual contact of the bulb of the thermometer with the interference
tripod has been very exhaustively proved. Mere hanging of a straight thermometer
alongside the chamber, as in the apparatus employed by PuxrricH, affords no
guarantee, especially with a closed interference chamber, that the tripod and its
contents actually attain the temperature indicated thereby. In the author’s expe-
rience, even with an open chamber, it never does. The use of oil in the bath cannot
