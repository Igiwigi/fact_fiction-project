actually mixed up with bones of the animals in the loam or clay under a second and
newer floor of stalagmite®*.

To clear up my doubts, I resolved to take an early opportunity of examining an open
section T had long intended to visit in consequence of its interest in a purely geological
point of view, but now more particularly attractive in connexion with the important
question raised by M. Boventr DE PERTHES. This section, which is exposed in digging
