altogether fails to respond to stimuli applied at more than a certain distance from

2 (2) Another interesting fact brought out by this form of section is, that the tracts

V the polypite; for the certainty and vigour with which the polypite responds to a

& between any of these tubes. Indeed it frequently happens that a specimen which will

not respond at all to a stimulus applied between the radial tubes fg, and þ 7, will
respond certainly and well to a stimulus applied much further from the polypite, but
in the course of the radial tube 9 Þ.

(f) And this leads us to another point of interest. In such a form of section, when
