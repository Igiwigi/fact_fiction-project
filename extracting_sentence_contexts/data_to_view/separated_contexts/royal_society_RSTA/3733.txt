Harnessing instabilities and singularities. The microfluidic rainbow chip connects (a) the dispatcher to a (b) sloped [=
reservoir yielding the formation of drops, which eventually gather in a (c) monodisperse crystal (see (d) and [78]). (e) A
thermal treatment of a fibre allows for the core to melt and, subsequently, destabilize into a series of droplets via the Rayleigh— (3
Plateau instability. (f,g) Scanning electron microscopy images of such drops, after they cooled down into spherical particles 1&
with diameter ranging from 20 nm to 1.4mm. (Images from (a—d) are taken from [78] and (e—g) from [79].) (A) Helical th

is, of course, not exclusive to microfluidics and is in fact one of the many mechanisms inducing
topology changes in fluid mechanics, turning a macroscopic volume of liquid into a collection
of fragments via a more or less intricate sequential cascade of breakups [5]. As such, this field
has been widely studied and finds use in a variety of applicative settings, e.g. combustion, inkjet
printing, etc. We now turn to a second example described in this section, the in-fibre fabrication of spherical
particles obtained by harnessing the Plateau—Rayleigh instability [79].
