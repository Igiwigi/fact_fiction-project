The axes of both folds and faults run in a general
north-south direction. The yellow tuffs may: perhaps be the down-faulted continuation
of the tuffs on which the fossil trees were growing south of Lokitoi, but no remains
were found in them at this point. I believe the age of these movements to be late
Middle Pleistocene on account of the fact that Levallois artifacts having a similar
patination to the boulders of the Valley floor were found lying upon the surface. Though this is admittedly weak evidence, it is supported by the very existence of these
mounds, which being formed of such easily eroded material as they are, would surely
have been completely removed by erosion were they of much earlier origin. PEE 022
