27. Diagram A,—Insortion of a pair of septa after each pair of mesenteries (hypothetic) would result in
the eclocelic and entoowlic position of septa (primary cycle 12). Diagram B.—Insertion of a pair of septa after every two pairs of mesenteries (“ pause” of Lacaze
Durarrs) would result in the entocelic position only of the septa (primary cycle 6), m. main
septum ; ¢. counterseptum ; a. alar septa; (mesenteries after Lacaze Duvniers).
