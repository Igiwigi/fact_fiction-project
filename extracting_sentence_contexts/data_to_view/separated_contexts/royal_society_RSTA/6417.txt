If one performs two
such measurements in sequence, the outcomes will be different depending on the order in which
they are performed, because each creates a singular, unique measurement situation. As, however,
explained in ยง2, doing so requires two different experimental arrangements, and two different
quantum objects. This fact, underlain by the irreducible role of observational instruments and
the irreducible individuality of each event, is a manifestation of complementarity pertaining to
both the initial measurements used and the two alternative sequences considered, and hence
quantum-mechanical predictions concerning the outcome of possible experiments. By contrast, in Q-L phenomena, as in cognitive psychology and decision science, say, in
experiments based on asking a given question or set of questions, the object under investigation
is a human subject, the system comprised by consciousness and the unconscious of this subject,
a C-UC system. We keep in mind that one is dealing with mental rather than physical reality,
