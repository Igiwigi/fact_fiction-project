to rest our doubts respecting a- pheno-
menon of even greater importance, the existence of which,
every physiologist, who has treated on the subject, with the
exception of yourself, seems to.have been. disposed to deny. I allude to the fact of the ova of twins, and those of different
8exes too, coming from the same ovarium; when, as in the pre-
sent case, the fimbriated part of the Fallopian tube must ne-
cessarily remain attached for a considerable length of time
to the ovarium, 50 as to allow both ova to pass into the uterus,
without any union taking; place between their membranes at
any period of their progress through the tube, and afterwards
coming in contact with a different part of the womb, to which

they adhere. These circumstances necessarily suppose a dis-


312 Dr. GRANVILLE on a matl-conformation of

tance between the ova, which distance cannot exist without
two distinct momenta in the propulsion of the two ova from
the ovarium into the oviduct. What obtains in cases of twins, must also take place where
three, four, or even six children have been brought forth at one
birth; three ova being formed in each ovarium, so near to each
other, that the three points at which they were expelled, must
have all come within the long continued grasp of the fimbriated
bodies.
