* Tt will be remembered that the definition given in our former paper of the 8ensitive sfade is © the
in which the discharge is affected by the presence or approach of a conduetor.” This definition will be adnen
to thronghout. k

+ We 8ay that the discharge may be non-sensitive when there is no interruption in the external cir
because we shall see that it is not necessarily 80, jusb as in the case of tubes of lower exhanst a tub
high vacuum may itself cause the discharge passing through ib to become intermittent and sensitive.


ON THE SENSITIVE STATE OF VACUUM DISCHARGES. 593

+ | phosphorescence* when a conductor is brought into contact with the tube is not very
-— strongly marked, and is in fact often difficult to detect; but in these cases it will be
— found that the phosphorescence is highly sensitive to the approach of a conductor
— which is in metallic connexion with the negative terminal of the tube, a property
> which is quite as distinetive of the luminous phenomena, of the sensitive discharges of
which we have treated in our former paper as is their sensitiveness to the approach of
a conductor which is nob in connexion with any portion of the cireuit. We can thus
apply the term ©sensitive state” to discharges through tubes of high vacua, even
- though the phosphorescence should constitute the main or even the only visible portion
of the phenomena.

Taking, then, this extended conception of sensitiveness, we find that it appears in
Euades of high vacua under precisely the same conditions as in the cases with which we
'=have dealt in our previous paper. A machine giving a continuous current produces a
