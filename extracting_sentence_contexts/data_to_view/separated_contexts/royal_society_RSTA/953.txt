But algorithms are notoriously difficult 2
to grasp and understand, even for trained people like computer scientists (cf. [62,63]). This is :
partly because of proprietary reasons, most operators keeping their algorithms secret to maintain
competitive advantage, to prevent adversarial learning and gaming (cf. [64,65]). But making the
workings of algorithms transparent or explainable is further complicated by the fact that they
are often complex entities with a difficult genealogy: they are the product of many interventions,
by many different people, with different interests, values and goals (cf. [66-68]). Algorithms are
always in flux, because they continuously interact with many different actors (other algorithms,

users, developers, aggregate data, etc.) and in various different settings (cf. [69-71]). This makes it : &
hard to pinpoint what exactly can be made transparent.
