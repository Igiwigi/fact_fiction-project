2, There appeared to be two factors of equal importance in the process of steriliza-
tion, namely, the degree of heat and the duration of its application. These two factors
were mutually compensatory, in such fashion that a longer exposure to a lower tempe-

rature was equivalent to a shorter exposure to a higher temperature. For example,
speaking roughly, an exposure for an hour to a heat of 100* Cent. was equivalent to an
exposure for fifteen minutes to a heat of 109? Cent.

3. Slightly alkaline liquids were always more difficult to sterilize than slightly acid
liquids. This was probably due to the fact that albuminoid matter is more easily and
more completely coagulated by a given heat in acid than in alkaline solutions,

4. No organic liquid or mixture, 8ubjected for however short a time to the heat of
boiling water, eyer produced (provided there was no fresh infection) any fungoid
or torulaceous organisms*, Tf germination took place, the organisms produced invari-
ably belonged to the great group of Bacteria. This appears to indicate that Torule
and their germs are more easily destroyed by heat than Bacteria and their germs, No
development of Bacteria into fungoid vegetations was ever observed.

5. Sterilization generally proved to be permanent if germination did not occur within
four days. Sometimes, however, germination took place on the sixth or eighth day,
and yery rarely even as late as the tenth and twelfth day. Differences in the degree of
