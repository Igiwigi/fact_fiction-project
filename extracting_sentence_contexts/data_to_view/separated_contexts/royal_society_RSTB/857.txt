On the scales of the lateral
line which remain in situ the black and yellow chromatophores are more abundant
and uniformly distributed. Also when the few loose scales still adhering to the skin
are examined their outer sides are found to contain the same black and yellow
chromatophores. It is a curious fact that, although these yellow chromatophores
by transmitted light are always yellow under Zurss, A., or a higher power, and
appear dim yellow when the light is cut off from below, yet there is one condition
under which they appear distinctly green, namely, when seen with Appr’s substage
condenser and his centre-spot diaphragm. ‘The reason of this is probably that they
are then seen against a black back-ground. When the internal layer of the skin in the dorsal-coloured region is examined, —

black and yellow chromatophores are seen closely crowded together.
