From it we conclude that acceleration damping
(ie. the effect of thé terms in f/V) and jet damping (terms in x) have a stabilizing influence on
the motion of the rocket. This explains the well-known fact frequently observed in trials
that many rockets which become unstable after burnt have a comparatively steady motion
during burning.} Now write ; S, = 4G3f?— (0, V—2xf,)?, (8-42-4)
