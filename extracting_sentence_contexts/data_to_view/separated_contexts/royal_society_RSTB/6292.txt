Traces seem to pass between both
preplumulae and prepennae, but never so distinctly as between two prepennae.

28 days—The dead specimen of a Chinese gosling opened on the 28th day is
covered with fully formed feathers, similar in structure to those described for the
25th day, but completely cornified (except for points of fusion), and with a longer
calamus. The latter has the same crescentic base in transverse section as a duckling
protoptile, but with the convexity facing the side, instead of towards the surface of
the skin. This may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a goose protoptile
is much deeper and correspondingly more oblique than that of a fowl. Pulp is still
present, although withdrawn towards the centre in the tip of the feather. The most striking feature of this gosling is the clearly defined blood system ; the
course of the single central blood vessel surrounded by a circle of anastomosing
capillaries is easily followed.
