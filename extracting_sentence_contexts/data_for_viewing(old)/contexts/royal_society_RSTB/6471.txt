cord, and are roughly conical in shape with a long tapering inner end of barely
sufficient width, along the greater part of its length, to be visible even under high
magnification. The cells secrete an intracellular fibre (supp. fib.) which extends
from the cuticle to the connective tissue at the base of the plexus. In the neighbour-
hood of the mouth of the optic cup some few of the supporting fibres bend inwards
so that their peripheral ends enter the biconvex hyaline structure (/.) which fits into
and closes the mouth of the optic cup. This biconvex structure is described by


142 J. E. SMITH

Prerrer (1901) as a lens of ectodermal origin, a statement of the accuracy of which
there can be little doubt. The fact that the supporting fibres enter its substance
shows that the lens cannot be of a cuticular derivation, and that it must be regarded,
not as a product of secretion of the epithelial cells but as part of the epithelial cells
themselves, and as such must contain a portion of the supporting fibres. The cuticle
(cut.) remains as a thin covering, closely applied to the outer surface of the lens.
