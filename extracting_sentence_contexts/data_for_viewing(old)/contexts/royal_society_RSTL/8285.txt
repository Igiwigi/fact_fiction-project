The bark of one specimen, but which stands alone amongst the number of those that
I have examined, exhibits conditions requiring further elucidation: I am as yet unable
fully to understand its significance, but it is suggestive of additional facts belonging to
the history of Dictyozylon that have not yet been worked out. In this specimen, part
of which is represented by Plate XXVI. fig. 25, we have the exterior of the ligneous zone
at d. Some very slight traces of the parenchymatous layer of the bark are to be seen
investing the woody zone. On the other hand, the prosenchymatous layer (&) is very thick :
this thickness is due to the appearance of a large double vascular bundle, snrrounded
by a considerable mass of parenchyma, which is lodged in the substance of the prosen-
chymatous layer. Two of the vertical prosenchymatous laminee, seen at #, }', have obvi-
ously been pushed aside to make room for the aboye intrusive structure. I have already
mentioned the fact that I have never seen any of the cortical bundles located in the pro-
senchymatous zone of the bark, save in one solitary instance, the latter reference being
to the example now under consideration. The double yascular mass (2) bears 0 striking
a resemblance to these bundles when but partially divided, as to leave little doubt that
it is really one of them. At the first glance we might suppose that it had been acci-
dentally displaced from its normal position and forced, by pressure, into the outer bark ;
but such is certainly not the case. The parenchyma with which it is 8urrounded is
identical with that separating all the prosenchymatous laminee, leaving little reason to
question that one of the parenchymatous areolze of the outer bark has been specially ſ
enlarged to admit of the outward transmission of the vascular bundle and its thick paren-
chymatous investment, the vertical prosenchymatous layers (, &) having been thrust ©
apart, to make room for this enlargement and transmission. l
