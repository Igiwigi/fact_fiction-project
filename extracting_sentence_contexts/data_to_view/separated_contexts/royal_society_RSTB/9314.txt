The scrutiny that products
and manufacturing processes can undergo during adversarial
legal battles may also keep potential companies out of the
forensic DNA marketplace. Another important reason that forensic DNA may not
involve cutting-edge technology is the need to maintain connec-
tion to legacy information from results already collected. The
fact that the USA has 14 million STR profiles (most with the
13 core STR loci selected in 1997) in its national DNA database
means that switching to completely different genetic markers,
such as SNPs or InDels, is not feasible (see also [15,66]). Switch-
ing to another set of genetic markers for established DNA
databases does not make sense when doing so would, in the
case of the USA, render obsolete a billion dollar investment. Thus, genetic markers used in future DNA databases will
most probably include current core STR loci plus additional
ones to avoid adventitious matches [25,26].
