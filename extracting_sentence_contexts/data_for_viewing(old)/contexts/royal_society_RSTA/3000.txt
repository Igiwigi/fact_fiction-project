where F; denotes the Fourier transform in time and L(w)=(1+iw/y)! is the Lorentzian
function. The fact that equations of the same type as equation (3.2) could be solved by a Fourier
method as a functional mapping in the long delay limit was already pointed out in [36] for the case
of a single variable. Applying Fourier transformation in the transverse plane yields the following
form of the functional mapping:

An = FrML()FF (Me? Fy (e8 ie Gra 2g) Qu-1/2+16 4,1}, (3.4)

with the carrier profiles G,;_; and Q,—1 that can be deduced from the field distribution A,_1.
Finally, using the fact that the function L(w) (ei?) does not depend on transverse wavenumber
q (frequency w), we can reorder the Fourier transformations to obtain

An= FU, QF (0 ias)Gn-/2- 11a) Qn-1/2+i6 A, 4), (3.5)

with F = F; o F, and U(w,q) = L(w) ei? exp(—ivw), where the last exponential factor represents
an ad hoc correction to the natural drift of the temporal solution from one round trip towards
the next. Such drift is found in most DDE systems and in our case one can simply take v  —1/y,
see [11,36] for more details.

A numerical method based on the use of equation (3.5) was applied to calculate bifurcation
diagrams of the LB solutions. An important advantage of this approach is that the temporal
domain along the t-axis can be taken much smaller than the delay time T, e.g. a few times larger
