stomata been closed there must have resulted a great increase in the assimilation.
This was not the case; in fact there was a decrease owing to the duration of the
experiment. The rise in the respiration resulting from the wounding of the leaf could
introduce no error, since at so low a temperature the respiration even if doubled or
trebled would still be negligible.

As a contrast to the above an experiment may be given in which cutting produced
an increase in the assimilation. A leaf dried over calcium chloride assimilates very
feebly. On cutting, the CO, absorption became very much greater, showing that the
small amount obtained before was due to closure of the stomata (see Exp. XX VII.).

As regards the change in form of the curve (fig. 2), Experiment XIX., Table IV., in
which the temperature was gradually raised during a reading, gives a very good
demonstration of the fact that at +3°6 C. the value of the assimilation is already
