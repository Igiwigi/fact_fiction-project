Perhaps the most important differ-
ouve ig the rewqovul of the two claustra from any obvious physiological relations with
the atriel cavities in the Siluridie, ond i is hy no means clear whether this should Ibe
Tegarded as u Joss ar a gain from a physivlogical point of yiew. Of the remaining families of the Ostariophyse the Characinidse closely resemble
the Cyprinidi in so far us the points now under disvussion are concerned, and of the
Gyronotidse it may be said that they exhibit a somewhat less specialized condition of
the ai-bladder and Weberian ossicles than any of the preceding families, although
Abviously related to the Cyprinoid type.
oe The conclusion suggested hy these facts seems to us to be this—that, physiologi-
@lly considered, the most important distinctive features of the Weberian mechanism
38 the Silurides as compared with other Ostariophysee are mainly related to the air-
Bulder, which in the former attains tis maximuni degree of specialization as an organ
@apied for the registration of varying hydrostatic pressures,

an considering, from a physiological point of view, the significance of the structural
Bilifications presented by the air-bladder and its adjuncts in this section of the
Baily, we may, in the first place, briefly capitulate certain anatomical facts already
ig@utioned in a previous section of this paper.
gApart from a very considerable reduction, both in absolute and relative size, the
a@sence of lateral chambers and the persistence of the anterior chamber only, the most
wteworthy features in the air-bladder of the various genera of Siluridse abnovmales
aze—its constriction, partial or complete, into two laterally-situated nir-sacs, which may
ngt only lose all connection with each other, but with the esophagus also; the
tendency of the air-sues to become more or less completely enclosed within variously-
famed hony capsules; the occasional atrophy of the ductus pneumaticus, or its persis-
ce asa solid fibrous cord ; aud frequently also, in addition, the more or less complete
ply of the fibres which normally form the dorsal walls of lateral halves of the
Fldlder, und connect the lateral walls with the crescentic processes of the tripodes. To these may be added the partial solidification of the organ in certain species, either
through the thickening and matting together of its walls, or the development of
intsrnal fibrous trabecule, or through the partial obliteration of ils cavity through
the growth of a thick central column of fibres. With the exception of the inter-
cularia, which ave often absent, without, however, in any wiy interfering with the
couplete anatomical connection of the tripodes with the seaphia and the claustra,
Which apparently have no functional significance in the Siluridi, the remaining
Weberian ossicles are fairly well developed, and retain their normal relative size,
Tewwes of degeneration are, however, to be met with.
