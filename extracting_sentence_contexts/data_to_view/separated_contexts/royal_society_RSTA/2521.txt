Linear logic can be axiomatized by various variants of star-autonomous categories [23-26]. For
intuitionistic logic, a reasonable notion of proof identity is given by the axioms of a Cartesian
closed category [22]. In fact, one can say that the proofs of intuitionistic logic are the arrows in the
free Cartesian closed category generated by the set of propositional variables. A naive approach for extending this result to classical logic would be to add an involutive
negation to a Cartesian closed category, ie. a natural isomorphism between A and the double-
negation of A. But this immediately gives us a collapse into a Boolean algebra, i.e. any two proofs
f,g: Aâ€” Bare identified [22,34].
