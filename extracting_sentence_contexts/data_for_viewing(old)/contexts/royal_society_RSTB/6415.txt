The linear regression coefficient of penetration time on relative humidity,
— 0-129 + 0-031, was highly significant and accounted for 52-5°% of the variance.

The preliminary results for short feeding periods are given in Table X in which the
number of infections obtained from feeding on the first plant of each pair are given
in the columns headed A. The columns headed B give the total number of infections

in the second series of plants, and the C columns show the number of consecutive
infections in which both A and B were infected. The fact that B infections occur
when A is not infected may have been due to failure on the part of the observer
to ensure proper feeding on A, but later experiments indicate that this is unlikely,
so that a large proportion of these also represent consecutive infections (p. 483).
