g filamentar junction with one taken through a free part of the filament, that the inter-
& filamentar junction lies internally to, 7.e., on the interlamellar side of, the filament
3 proper. This gives one a means of distinguishing in more diffieult cases between the
§ filament proper and such secondary growths as may give an exaggerated appearance
to the width of the filament—-width here referring to the measurement from the
A interlamellar edge to the frontal surface. The increment may be spoken of as the
interlamellay extension of the filament. A comparative glance at sections of Astarte
and Ephippodonta (figs. 22 and 25) will render it clear that, in the latter, what might
at first appear to be very broad laminate filaments united by interfilamentar junctions
at a distance of one-third of their width from the frontal edges, are in reality
composite structures, the outer third of which is constituted by the filament proper
and the inner two-thirds by the interlamellar extension. A further means of dis
tinguishing the filament proper in such cases as this is the fact that the chitinous
lining is thickened in the filament proper but not in its interlamellar extension.
If the interlamellar extensions of a descending filament and its corresponding

ascending filament become united across the interlamellar space, an interlamellar
septum is formed; and in the filaments of Are granosa and Area americana
(fig. 10A, p. 199), and the principal filaments of Pecten and Spondylus, the appear-
ances are decidedly suggestive of the fact that the great flap developed on the
upper part of the descending filament has been unable to produce a high septum in
consequence of the failure on the part of the ascending filament to respond to a
