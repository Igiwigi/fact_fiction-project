The Time-Relation.—In every concept a dyadic serial relation, having for its field
the instants of time and these only, is necessary. The properties of this Zime-
Relation form the pure science of chronology. The time-relation is, in all concepts, a
serial relation ordinally similar to the serial relation which generates the series of
negative and positive real numbers.* This fact need not be further specified during
the successive consideration of the various concepts, nor need any of the propositions
of pure chronology be enunciated. Definition.—The class of instants of time is always denoted by T in every concept. The Essential Relation.—In every concept at least all the propositions of geometry
will be exhibited as properties of a single polyadic relation, here called the essential
relation.
