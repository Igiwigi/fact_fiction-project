Transport equations (which, together with the thermodynamic equations of state, define a
material) are essential in the analysis of non-equilibrium systems. Usually, they express the
fluxes in terms of gradients of some physical quantities (for instance, the thermodynamic
conjugates to conserved variables). Indeed, in classical transport equations (Fourier Law,
Fick Law, Ohm Law, Seebeck Law, Peltier Law, Soret Law, Dufour Law, etc.) the heat flux,
the mass flux and the electric flux are expressed in terms of the gradients of temperature,
chemical potentials and electrical potential, denoted as thermodynamic forces (with forces
understood not as mechanical forces, but in a more general sense, in an analogous way to
which one may speak of social forces or economical forces, as causes producing some effects)
[15]. In fact, each flux may depend on several different forces, though a number of different
couplings.


The fluxes are not necessarily simple physical quantities, but they may be constituted by asum 3 |
of several contributions. For instance, the heat flux may contain terms related to the transport

of molecular kinetic energy, molecular potential energy, vibrational and rotational energies of 3
the molecules, and so on [17]. Analogously, the mass flux will be a sum of the contributions of 1S

the mass fluxes of different kinds of chemical species in the system, and the momentum flux in
macromolecular solutions or blends will contain the contributions of the several internal degrees
of freedom of the macromolecular chains or networks [5,6,9-12,16,17].
