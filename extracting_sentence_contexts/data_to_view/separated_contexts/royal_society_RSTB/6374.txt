In the neighbour-
hood of the mouth of the optic cup some few of the supporting fibres bend inwards
so that their peripheral ends enter the biconvex hyaline structure (/.) which fits into
and closes the mouth of the optic cup. This biconvex structure is described by


142 J. E. SMITH

Prerrer (1901) as a lens of ectodermal origin, a statement of the accuracy of which
there can be little doubt. The fact that the supporting fibres enter its substance
shows that the lens cannot be of a cuticular derivation, and that it must be regarded,
not as a product of secretion of the epithelial cells but as part of the epithelial cells
themselves, and as such must contain a portion of the supporting fibres. The cuticle
(cut.) remains as a thin covering, closely applied to the outer surface of the lens. cu√©.
