In this section, we follow [21]; we do not use here the resonance approximation. In one-
dimensional geometry, equation (4.1) takes the form

For Uj =0, it coincides with the Schrédinger equation (equation (3.1)). Mathematically,
equation (4.3) is the well-known nonlinear Schrédinger equation [2]. In infinite space, without
a trap, known are solutions to equation (4.3) describing modulational instability, cnoidal waves,
bright and dark solitons, and oscillating localized structures—breathers. For a dynamical trap
with finite length (equations (3.2)), it is possible to find quasi-energy states, as in §3 [25]; however,
owing to the problem nonlinearity, the superposition principle is not applicable in this case.
When a moving bright soliton collides with an ideal motionless mirror, its kinetic energy does
not change. In fact, one can replace this problem by the collision of a soliton with its antiphase
mirror image, the summed field at the mirror location being zero; this problem is solved by the
inverse scattering transform method [2]. If the mirror moves with some constant velocity, the
problem is reduced to the previous one using Galilean transformation symmetry; depending
on the sign of the mirror velocity, the soliton can be accelerated or decelerated. For periodic
oscillations of mirrors, increase or decrease of soliton kinetic energy depends periodically on the
oscillation phase at the moment of collision, as for point classical particles (we consider below the
case of narrow solitons with dimensionless width w <1 and oscillations with small frequency
2 <w~’). Additionally, as well as for classical particles, sufficiently slow solitons can collide
with the same mirror several times repeatedly before they move to the cavity centre. Results of
