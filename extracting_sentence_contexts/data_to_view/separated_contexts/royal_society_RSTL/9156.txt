(4.) Like the alcohols and acids the ethereal salts derived from them are highly
transparent to the ultra-violet rays, and do nob exhibit absorption bands,

PART IL.
Examination of Substances containing the Benzene Nucleus. In the examination of such substances as contain a closed chain of carbon atoms doubly
linked together, one fact presented itself in a striking manner. All these bodies are
strongly adiactinic, those which are the least 80 being the hydrocarbons ; Diagram No. 2,
will at once make this apparent, Professor SToKEs has pointed out that one of these
snbstances, salicine, in an aqueous solution, the strength of which is not stated, shows
a characteristic absorption band. Now salicine is a snbstance the constitution of which
is perfectly well known : it is a glucoside of saligenin,

C,H,(O0H)CH,

and consequently the absorption band may be due to the saligenin.
