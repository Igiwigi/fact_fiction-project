SURFACE-TENSION OF WATER BY THE METHOD OF JET VIBRATION. 309

We see that the mean radii a, determined in the two ways, are very nearly the
same (mutual deviation less than 01 per cent.), This conformity having been stated,
the velocity-determination was omitted at the later experiments and a was
determined by help of the photographs only, whereby the experiments became very
much simplified.

’ The Results of the Experiments. In the above we have described the methods used in the different measurements ;
it is further mentioned how it was possible, by the arrangement described on p. 301,
to keep the pressure-height and temperature of the water constant during the
comparatively long space of time taken to determine the discharges, the velocity, the
mean radius, and the wave-length. Before giving the results of the experiments we must, however, call attention to
some special circumstances occurring in the determination of the wave-lengths sought,
due to the fact that the wave-lengths found were not equal at different distances
from the orifice. In order to show plainly what is meant by this, we shall commence
with mentioning four experiments (one executed with each of the four tubes) carried
® out at a pressure-height of about 100 em., in which the single wave-lengths were
determined immediately outside the orifice and as far out on the jet as its stability
permitted. The results can be seen in the table overleaf:

As it will be seen, the differences between the readings are not constant, but
increase until they reach a maximum, whereupon they slowly decrease again.
