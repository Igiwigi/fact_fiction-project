In certain plicate Eulamellibranchia, notably the Tellinacea, Veneracea and
Myacea, there are vertically disposed blood tubes within the apex of the plica. They
ite conspicuously developed in Semele, Paphia, Donax faba (fig. 31B, p. 236) ;

a Venus (fig. 33, p. 241); Circe, Dosinia, Tapes (fig. 84, p. 242); Petricola (fig. 35,

SP 243); Psummobia (fig. $8, p. 249); Asuphis, Tagalus. They do not occur in the

= Pseudolamellibranchia, and there may be some functional significance in the fact that

athey are not found in gills which have enlarged apical filaments. What is probably

& more to the point is the fact that, in the forms mentioned above, the interlamellar

S septa are all high septa, not alternately high and low. It is as though in such forms

98 Cyrtodaria ov Lutraria (fig. 40, p. 251), the two blood tubes continued upward

5 5 from the low or incomplete septa were so widely divaricated that each two

a Padjacent plicse of the same lamella were thrown into one large plica, with the vessel

â€˜2 occupying its apex. The interlamellar septa that remained would then all be high

"8 septa.
