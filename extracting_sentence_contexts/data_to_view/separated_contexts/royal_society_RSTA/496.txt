and the further condition that the last two of the coefficients (145) are equal require that
Di=£.
Now the condition that X,; be symmetrical in its indices is (cf. equation (47))

in D,o;. (146)
Substituting for , and 7; according to equations (139) in equation (146), we find that
(°D,-+- ED, +4) 55+ (uD, +-D,) 5 = D,s—D, sy (147)

With equation (147) satisfied, the two defining scalars of X;; are o, and o; and the defining
scalars of S;., then, are Sy = 0,(r, +4) +0,(r,—p)

and Sy = 0(7, +4) +09(7,—p). THEORY OF AXISYMMETRIC TURBULENCE 577

The vanishing of the trace of §,;, which was assumed in § 9 (equation (127)), follows from

the fact that in any homogeneous turbulence 7;, must vanish at the origin and that, therefore, [Sil--0 = 2LPil-=05 (149)
and that this last vanishes, follows directly from the representation of P, in terms of a.

It is worthy of notice here that according to the formulae we have given for the defining
scalars of S;; (cf. equations (122)) (Si)-=0 = 00
