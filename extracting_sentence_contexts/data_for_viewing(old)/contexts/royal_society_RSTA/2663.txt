penalizing data-taking. From the digital terrain models, we have produced a map of the various
traversed thicknesses as a function of elevation and azimuth angles (figure 16). The muon energy
spectrum used for this estimate was taken from the paper by Tanaka eft al. [8], but we have
developed our own muon spectrum generator (with flux dependence on energy and angle) using
data collected by the ADAMO experiment [9].

We have also derived sensitivity estimates to density variations as a function of years of data-
taking (figure 17). For a given density variation, the indicator gives the significance of the eventual
signal expressed as a number of sigmas (using Poisson statistics).

The plots show the level of significance we can reach in terms of a minimal density variation
of only 5%. We expect much greater density variations in the crater region, due to not only
the empty space inside the crater, but also to the solid rock plug. In fact, recent gravimetric
measurements seem to indicate the presence of a high-density layer of rock at the bottom of
the crater.

as a function of the observation angle, after (a) two-year and (b) four-year data-taking. Below a certain elevation, due to the
huge rock overburden, no discernible signal can be extracted. In the crater region (above 15°), the significant increases and more
