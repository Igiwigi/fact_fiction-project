vary from 5-3 for Haworthia Cooperi to 7-7p for Gasteria Croucheri spathulata, a
difference of 2-4, which seems of some significance. It is felt that the measurements
must be determined for a wider number of species before any generalised conclusion
can be made.


The fact that the lengths of the chromosomes of any one species tend to group
themselves round two very different values, a fact which is shown also by the drawings,
is emphasised by the results obtained on measuring the chromosomes. In all species
of the Aloinw, the lengths of the chromosomes fall into two classes, the smaller-sized
chromosomes being most frequently about 2» long, the larger varying from 5p to 9p
in length. The methods of microdissection have shown that chromosomes may be
easily stretched and deformed (CHAMBERS and SANps (3)), so that a certain amount
of irregularity is inevitable, due to the plastic nature of these bodies acted upon as
they are by unknown but undoubted forces in the cell. Nevertheless, when the

x chromosomes are taken at the same stage of division, the forces acting are probably
