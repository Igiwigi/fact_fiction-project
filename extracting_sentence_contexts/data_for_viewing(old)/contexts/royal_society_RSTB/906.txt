Frog differs from the basophile cells found elsewhere in the body. The differences are of two ae
(1) the peritoneal cells are larger, and (2) the basophile granules which they contain are larger and —
are well-defined spheres. The peritoneal cells thus show granules belonging to Eurtuicu’s group 4.


AND BEHAVIOUR OF THE WANDERING CELLS OF THE FROG. 289

, there is also (3) a plasmodial mass, formed of both eosinophile and hyaline
. With regard to the third case we are not prepared to say whether the fusion
mplete, a single plasmodium resulting, or whether the plasmodium is double, the
ophile cells being in contact with an inner hyaline plasmodium.

Various observers have noted the fact that the eosinophile cells are relatively
‘e numerous in Frogs during winter. Our observations have been confined to
‘summer months, and we have found that the relative number of the different
ses of cells varies in different parts of the body. In the lymph from the
taneous lymph spaces the eosinophile variety form from 17 to 25 or 30 per
of the total number of cells. The basophile cells form about 2 per cent.
the peritoneal fluid the percentage of eosinophile cells is higher, ranging from
®to 50 per cent.

puscles and platelets, which stand on a different footing from the rest, may be
