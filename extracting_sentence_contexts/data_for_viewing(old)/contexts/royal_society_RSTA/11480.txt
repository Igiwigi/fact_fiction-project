The interesting point is the connection of the problem with the theory of the
two-dimensional partitions of any set of Sa unequal numbers.

The graph solution proves at once the remarkable theorem that if (b:b2b3...) be the
partition conjugate to (aa213...),

(a,@yMtg...3) = (Diab... 5),

a fact which it would be difficult to establish by pure algebra. In this case the
corresponding probabilities are in the inverse ratio of

(GatQ,+G5+...)! bs (Ditbs+ds+...)!
