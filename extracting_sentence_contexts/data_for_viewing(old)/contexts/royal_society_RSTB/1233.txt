fig. 51 is shown a transverse section of the sporangium of LD. carinatum, cut so ‘
traverse the sub-archesporial pad (s.p.) at a point immediately above the insertig
the stalk ; this was drawn for purposes of comparison, and will be referred to |
on. The shaded portions represent the sporogenous tissue. Specimens of thi
of the two preceding species, were kindly sent to me from Buitenzorg, by Dr. T;

Lycopodium dichotomum. Jaca. (= L. mandioccanum. Rapp.)

Specimens of this species were supplied to me from the Botanic Garden of Brus
These show the sporangium to be similar as regards form to those of L. phlegme
and carinatum (fig. 92) though the stalk is somewhat more massive, and the §
archesporial pad is more largely developed. The chief interest, however, in
sporangia of this species lies in the fact that the wall of the sporangium is of uni
thickness. A detailed examination shows that the wall of the sporangium con
of some 4-7 layers of cells (figs. 52, 53); the number is not exactly defined, nor is
arrangement of the cells very regular ; the outermost layer develops with thicker
as in other species; the innermost is the tapetum, while between these inter
several layers of thin-walled cells, which evidently have been increased in numb
periclinal divisions (fig. 52). The development shows that this is the case, and
the difference between this and other species is due to additional periclinal di
in the wall, and not to the contribution of tissues from the sporogenous mass
tissues of the wall.

The interest of this departure from the usual type of Lycopodium rests on}
parison with other forms ; it will be shown later, that in “ Brown’s Cone” of Le
