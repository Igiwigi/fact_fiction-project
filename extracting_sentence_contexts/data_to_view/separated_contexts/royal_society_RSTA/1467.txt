Therefore, any statement that links convergence of GMRES solely with the distribution of the
eigenvalues of the system matrix must be justified in relation to these results proved more than
20 years ago. This is in the literature done very rarely. The clustering argument is often used in combination with the remarkable fact pointed out
in [83] that a certain class of preconditioners leads to preconditioned matrices with a low degree
minimal polynomial. Such preconditioners are very important in practice where they are often
replaced by some more computationally feasible approximations, which can lead instead of a
low degree minimal polynomial to a few tight clusters of eigenvalues. This subtle shift requires
a rigorous analysis.
