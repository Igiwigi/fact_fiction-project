Sections of leaflets, such as are usually found associated with Myeloxylon, are very
common among the fragments of the petioles and rachis. One of the best is shown
in transverse section in Plate 12, fig. 17. The midrib contains two bundles close
together, which, so far as the imperfect preservation allows one to judge, appears to
have been collateral, with the phloem directed outwards. The lamina, which is
incurved at either margin, has a distinct palisade layer, and is manifestly of bifacial
type. A vascular bundle of the lamina, which runs near the lower surface, is well
shown in longitudinal section. I have not yet found absolute proof that these leaflets
belong to the “Myeloxylon” rachis, but the constancy of association, and general agree-
ment in the structure leaves no real doubt. The leaf must have been very large ; in
one slide a rachis (probably of a primary pinna) can be traced in longitudinal section
for fully 5 inches, apparently without branching. In other cases branching is shown.
The facts just detailed show that Medullosa anglica bore large, highly compound
leaves, the petioles of which have the structure of the Myeloxylon Landriotii of
Renavtt. The latter is not to be regarded as a species in the same sense as in

* In another section a small rachis, like that shown in fig. 16, is seen arising as a branch from one of
larger dimensions.

speaking of recent plants, but rather as a type of petiolar structure, common, no
doubt, to a certain group of the Medullosez.
