lambs got by Dorset Horn rams will bear lambs got by Down rams.” I would suggest
that in this case the cause of abortion lies, not so much with the ewe, as in want of
vitality in the embryo, which when aborted early is absorbed in the uterus, escaping
the notice of the shepherd; and that where the Dorset Horn sheep have been served
by Down rams, there is less abortion as a result of increased vigour on the part of
the cross-bred young.

Lhe Formation of the Corpus Luteum.

The ages of the corpora lutea in this investigation were reckoned from coition,
or where coition did not or was not known to have taken place from the time
when cestrus was observed, the sheep being killed at various intervals of time
afterwards, ‘The facts recorded in the previous section of this paper indicate that
ovulation only takes place during the cestrous periods (or very possibly in some
instances in the procstrous periods which immediately precede them), while the
observed relation, as deseribed below, between the condition of development of the
corpus luteum and the interval that had elapsed between the oestrus noted and the
killing of the sheep in question, is by. itself” strong. evidence ‘that- the two
phenomena occur together. But the method adopted of reckoning the ages of the
developing corpora lutea is inevitably a somewhat arbitrary one, since, as already

* The failure of the Leicester rams here must be partly due to their being less suited to the Seotelr
climate in the latter part of the sexual season of Black-faced ewes,
