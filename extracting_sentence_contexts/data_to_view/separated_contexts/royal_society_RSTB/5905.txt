For the purpose of this description four specimens were used. One of these (E. 103)
is a complete lantern extracted bodily from its test. A second (EH. 252) shows a more
or less disjointed series of lantern ossicles, mixed up with numerous peristomial plates,
lying in the cavity of the test : MorrEnsEn (1933, p. 433) has already recorded the fact
that this specimen proves the Stirodont nature of the lantern. The third (EH. 251)
affords evidence of the nature of the rotula, and shows the interpyramidal faces of the
maxillee very well. The fourth (EK. 101) has been referred to above.
