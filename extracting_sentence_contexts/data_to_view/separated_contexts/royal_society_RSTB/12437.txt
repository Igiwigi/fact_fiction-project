Specifically, the pattern of activity in response to a
given item (network node) is similar to the pattern of activity
in response to another item (network node) to a degree dictated
by the topological distance between the items in the network
[117,118]. One could think of this form of representation as
one in which the brain represents the inter-item distance as a
particular type of relation encoded as a node itself in a labelled
graph. In fact, humans appear to organize conceptual knowl-
edge in the brain in a manner that is similar to how they
organize spatial knowledge [116], coding topological paths
akin to physical distances [40,117]. Suppose that this process
of producing patterns of activity whose relations match the
relations of the items they represent (or the parts of the
world they model) occurs consistently over a human’s lifetime,
and in fact also over the course of evolution; then what architec-
ture might most effectively underlie the active units to optimize
this process?

(a) Concordance between modeller and modelled

The terms reflect, model, process, represent and encode are dis-
tinct and can each separately help us to understand whether
and when the modeller and the modelled are somehow concor-
dant. Does a good apparatus display a form that reflects the
form of the material on which it works?
