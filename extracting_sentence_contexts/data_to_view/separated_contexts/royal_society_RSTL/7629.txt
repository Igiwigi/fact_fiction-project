The explosion of the fuse was attended by a precisely similar result
to that obtained in the preceding experiment. > It is believed that these experiments, together with the facts regarding the behayiour
2 of gun-cotton which have been stated in the earlier part of this paper, afford convincing
2 proof that the violent explosion of gun-cotton and nitroglycerine through the agency of
Z a detonating fuse must be ascribed either to the mechanical effect of that detonation
f (7.0. to the work done upon the particles more immediately exposed to the blow or con-
= cuxon of the detonation), or to the development of a disturbance of chemical equil-
S brium in the explosive agent by the suddenness and peculiar character of the concussion,
â€” or by the powerful vibrating impulse which the detonation establishes. V The readiness and certainty with which gunpowder, gun-cotton, and other explosive
= 8ubstances may be detonated through the agency of a blow from a hammer or a falling
5 body, are regulated by several circumstances; they are in direct proportion to the weight
Q of the falling body, to the height of its fall, or the force with which it is impelled down-
wards, to the velocity of its motion, to the mass and rigidity, or hardness, of the support
or anvil upon which the body falls; to the quantity and mechanical condition of: the
explosive agent struck, and to the ready explosibility of the latter.
