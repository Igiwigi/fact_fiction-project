in great detail or questions about the evolution of cities and
their complexity. Nevertheless, we will provide a rounded
enough review to hopefully engage the reader in some of
the key questions.

The current changes in our thinking about what is hap-
pening with respect to the study of location and movement
in cities arises from many issues. First, it is logical to suppose

In this paper, we will take Capra & Luisi [8] at their word and
demonstrate how movements need to be defined not only for-
mally and through data but also in terms of their
visualization. We will in fact map physical movements
quite literally as cartographic patterns but also in terms of
other ways of showing spatial relationships. Before we
launch into models and methods for doing this however,
we need to define how we might best represent movement
in cities and to this end, we will define the wider domain
in which such relationships exist.
