to the long axis of the lobe : they are shorter and thicker than the corresponding cells

Q in ML. cephalus; their ugual size is 0018 millim. long by 0016 millim. broad ; some
NQ areas long as 0'022 millim. ; the nucleus is about 0-009 millim. in diameter, and the
S nucleolus 0-002 millim. ; there is a circular space round the nucleolus, which is clearer
= and smoother than the remainder of the contents of the nucleus : these cells then
'= resemble those of the motor horn of the grey matter of the spinal cord, in the disk-like
SZ nucleolus and the clear space which surrounds it. Each Purkinje cell has two processes,
S one thicker, corresponding to the protoplasmic processes of the cells of the spinal cord;
& the other finer, corresponding to the axis-cylinder process of the same. T never could
@ perceive any prolongation of this into the nucleus, but on the other hand, the axis-
Z cylinder process was in one case distinctly traceable into one of the medullated fibres
IS of the longitudinal bundles belonging to the intermediate layer. This fact confirms
"5 the statement of KosCHENIKOFF,+ and also accords well with the theory which I
2 guggested in the description of the cerebellum in MM. cephalus, and which only required
2 this arrangement to complete the statement.

Z Tt now remains to consider the granular layer of the cerebellum ; DENISSENKO
S dexcribed a method by which he thought he had demonstrated the existence of two
E different, species of cells in this layer. During the process of double staining with

Â© eoxin and hematoxylin, he maintained that one kind of cell takes up one colour and
= another kind absorbs the other colour ; he thus had the 80-called eosin cells and the
SZ haematoxylin cells. Whatever may be the case in higher animals, in Fishes there
= exists only one species of cell in this layer; I tried the experiment several times,
