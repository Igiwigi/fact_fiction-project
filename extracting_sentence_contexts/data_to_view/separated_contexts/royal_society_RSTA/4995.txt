This rise of v is mostly detrimental up to approximately 0.29
(figure 5) as it results in an increase of the residual stresses. Only for glasses with v over say 0.35
would this transition from densification to isochoric shear induce a ductile behaviour. As a matter
of fact, silicon oxynitride glasses with v typically as large as 0.3 [16] and in spite of an exceptional
mechanical performance (values of E as large as 150GPa are common for rare-earth-containing
silicon oxynitride glasses) are very sensitive to radial-median cracking (figure 1). In order to reduce the intensity of the stress field that builds up on indentation, and especially
the blister field, it is inferred from the physics of the permanent deformation processes (figure 5)
that Poissonâ€™s ratio in the 0.25-0.33 range should be avoided, unless the E/H ratio is smaller than
say 7 (figure 9). There are glasses with v larger than 0.33, for instance in metallic systems [86],
but also possibly in oxynitride ones.
