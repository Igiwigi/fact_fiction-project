The simplest method of comparing the testes of the British male starlings with those of
the Continental birds was by measuring their volumes. As many of the testes were extremely
small it was not practical to do this by any method of displacement, and the volumes were
therefore calculated from the measurements of the lengths and breadths. In the case of
very small testes these measurements were made by means of a micrometer scale and a
low-power microscope, but in the case of the larger testes the measurements were made
with callipers. On the assumption that the testis is an oblate spheroid, the volume was
then calculated according to the formula

V = 4nab?,

where V = the volume, a = half the length, 6 = half the breadth. This assumption certainly
introduced an error as did also the fact that the measurements were all made after fixation,
but it was considered that the calculated volumes were sufficiently accurate for the pur-
poses of comparison. The volumes of the two testes of each individual were calculated
separately and the results added together. The figures given later therefore refer to the
total testis volume per bird.

In the case of the females, comparisons of the gross proportions of the ovaries were not
so easy. The ovary has a very irregular shape, and it is not easily dissected from the under-
lying kidneys and adrenals. An entirely different method had therefore to be adopted,
and it was found that a useful factor for comparison was the diameter of the largest oocyte
in each ovary measured after the ovary had been sectioned. In this case, as in the male,
measurements were made after fixation, but the error so introduced, being of the same order
in all cases, should not seriously affect the comparisons between the individuals.
