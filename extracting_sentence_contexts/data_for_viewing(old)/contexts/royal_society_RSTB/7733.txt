periostracum (P) with inner (JC) and outer (OC) calcareous layers.

Unfortunately, no precise record was made during the short period spent at Bermuda,
but certainly a strip of new shell, 3-5 cm wide, was added during the course of 3 days,
and most of it may have been formed during a fraction of this time. There is no doubt
that the mantle margin, i.e. the outer lobe of the mantle edge, initiates all repair as well
as the addition of new shell during growth. Grave describes how in Afrina rigida the edge
of the mantle is withdrawn and applied to the base of the notch formed by breaking the
shell. Moreover, when holes were cut at some distance from the edge of the shell, the
margin of the mantle was similarly withdrawn before repair began. It is the great extent
to which the mantle can be withdrawn that makes this possible. What is also apparent
is the capacity of the extensive area within the mantle edge (and having similar histological
structure) to increase the thickness of the prismatic layer, a fact originally noted by
Jackson (1890). Thus newly formed marginal shell is no more than some 130, thick,
whereas it is at least ten times as thick in the regions where it becomes covered by the
inner shell layer. Whereas in a typical lamellibranch, e.g. Tivela as described by Wey-
mouth (1923), all the outer layers of the shell are laid down over a very limited area to
be followed, almost immediately, by underlying layers of inner shell, in the Pinnidae
this process takes place over a very wide area. The difference (and underlying similarity)
between the two is shown in figure 13.

Shell growth in Pinna represents the most extreme example of what becomes possible
after loss of the primary muscle (and to a greater or lesser extent also periostracal)
attachments. All monomyarians belonging to the Anisomyaria have lost primary pallial
attachments (apart from the posterior adductor) as described elsewhere (Yonge 1953),
