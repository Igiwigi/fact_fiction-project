The mean of all Durrretp’s values, set B,* has been taken, assuming proportionality
of displacement to increase of pressure. The values in the second column have been
obtained from GALE and ADAms’ main series of measurements at nine atmospheres.

It will be observed that the values given in the last column are, on the average,
higher than the other two. This is to be expected from the fact that all the lines
referred to are reversed in the arc under eleven-atmospheres pressure, but bright in
the spark under the present experimental conditions. It has been foundt that if a
line is reversed at a given pressure its shift is very much smaller than when it is
unreversed.

8. Classification of Shifts.

As the measured lines belonging to each class are mostly comprised between
somewhat narrow limits of wave-length, no attempt has been made to investigate the
law of variation of displacement with wave-length. Consequently the shifts have not
been reduced to a standard wave-length, which is desirable in discussing their relative
magnitudes.
