root of the fifth nerve. Transverse sections, taken from the region of the lower er
of the inferior olive (see fig. 11), show that although a well-marked tract of degene
rated fibres still occupies the lateral peripheral region of the medulla, it is not
large a band as was met with at higher levels, and numerous degenerated fibre
are to be seen scattered in the gray matter internal to this chief band, whie
occupies the region of the lateral medullary tract. Degenerated fibres pass
this peduncle to both inferior olives, but no well-marked tract of degenerated fibre
such as might have been expected, passes to the opposite inferior olive (see fig. 12).
A section taken at the level of the decussation of the fillet, or superior pyramidal
decussation, demonstrates the existence of degenerated fibres scattered in the g
matter on the side of the cerebellar lesion, and that near the periphery of the
medulla ; just external to the nucleus lateralis these degenerated fibres are mo
numerous, and form, in fact, a slender band (see fig. 13). This is, however, th
last level at which a band of degenerated fibres, worthy of the name of
descending tract from the cerebellum, can be traced. Below this there are cer
tainly some degenerated fibres occupying the periphery of the antero-lateral regi
of the cervical portion of the spinal cord, but they are extremely few, and Â¢
scattered (see fig. 14). By the time the dorsal region of the cord is reached there i
scarcely a degenerated fibre to be seen, if one, occupying this antero-lateral region
of the cord, in which region Marcur figures so extensive a tract of degenerated
fibres as passing down even to the lumbar region of the spinal cord, where not
single degenerated fibre was found by me after ablation of one lateral lobe of the
cerebellum.
