At the distal end, where the sporophyll becomes convex on its upper surface, the
sporangium follows its curvature, and assumes what may be called the “ saddle-bags ”
form when seen in tangential section (see phots. 8 and 6; fig. 2). As the sporophyll
curves upwards towards the vertical lamina, the height of the sporangium
correspondingly diminishes, and at the distal end its cavity is quite narrow, and its
form, as seen in tangential section, three-lobed, consisting of the apical ridge and the
two lateral flaps in contact with the sloping cushions. In fact, the distal end of the
sporangium applies itself closely to the curvature of the sporophyll surface ; seen in
horizontal section it shows two lateral processes following the surface of the lamina,
