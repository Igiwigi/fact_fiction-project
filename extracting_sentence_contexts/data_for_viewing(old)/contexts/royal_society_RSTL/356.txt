destroys the power of the heart.

The conclusions then at which we arrive, are,â€”that the
heart is excited by all stimuli applied to any considerable part
of the nervous system, while the muscles of voluntary motion
are only excited by intense stimuli applied to certain small
parts of this system.

These facts being ascertained, the other differences observed
in the effects of stimuli applied to the nervous system, on the
heart and muscles of voluntary motion, are easily explained.

Irregular action of a muscle arises from stimuli acting par-
tially, or at intervals, on its nerves, or on the particular part
of the brain or spinal marrow, from which its nerves arise.
But partial action of a stimulus on the nervous system, we
have just een, is incapable of exciting the heart, and while
the stimulus is applied to any part of the nervous system, as
all parts of this system seem equally to influence the heart, it
cannot act upon it interruptedly, as an instrument does on the
muscles of voluntary motion when it is moved from place to
