the dotted line, differs by about 2a? from the theoretical end-point. But the amount
of this difference is much more sensitive to the actual value taken for the upper limit
E,, than is the corresponding quantity for the /,-spectra. This fact makes it almost
impossible to estimate a? from the K-spectra, except as regards order of magnitude. However, the value 10a? for £,, gives the correct form of the L,-spectra, and we think
it may be fairly accurate to assume the same value for the K-spectra and to correct
the extrapolated end-point by the value 2a’. To summarize this discussion, it seems that the theory of the broadening of levels
of a band accounts adequately for the features of the /(£)/v> curves for negative and
small positive values of £.
