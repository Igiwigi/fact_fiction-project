The epididymal and testicular hydatids of monkeys cannot be distinguished from
each other either macroscopically or microscopically. Moreover, clear evidence was
obtained of the relation of both kinds of hydatid to remnants of a canal which on
topographical grounds was taken to be the Miillerian duct. Doubts about the embryo-
logical identity of the testicular and epididymal hydatids do not therefore arise.

The testicular attachment of the hydatids in man is secondary, growth in the head
of the epididymis displacing the cranial end of the Miillerian duct from the head of the
epididymis where it is found in early embryonic life. It thus follows that there is a
greater tendency for the embryonic condition of the Miillerian duct to persist in male
monkeys than in males of the human species. A similar tendency is reflected in the
fact that as a rule relatively more of the Miillerian duct appears to persist in the male
monkey than in the human male. The carrying over of embryonic characters into
post-natal and adult life is referred to in evolutionary discussion as neoteny, and, in
general, man is regarded as being neotenic in relation to subhuman primates (BOLK
1926). In detail, however, the picture of man’s neoteny or “‘foetalization” is an

illusory one (ZUCKERMAN 19364), and it is thus not surprising to find that, so far as
the persistence of the Miillerian duct is concerned, it is the male monkey which is neo-
tenic with respect to man, and not man who is neotenic with respect to the monkey.
