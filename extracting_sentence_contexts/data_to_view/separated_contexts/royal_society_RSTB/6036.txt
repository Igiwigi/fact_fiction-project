development and extension backwards of an inner portion of this muscle is not connected
with the development of the tongue as a swiftly erectile organ. The presence of an os parahyoideum in Discoglossus, Alytes and Liopelma emphasizes
their inter-relationship. The fact that the bone has become incorporated in the hyoid
plate in Liopelma, does not, in my opinion, argue against its homology with that found
in the others. The parahyoid bone of Liopelma does not appear on the dorsal side of
the hyoid plate, but the hyoid ossifications of Bombina do. Otherwise the paired
ossifications in Bombina bear to the paired parahyoid bones of Discoglossus the same
relation that is borne by the single bone of Liopelma to that of Alytes, and it seems
legitimate to assume that the hyoid ossifications in the four genera are homologous.
