the mean normal pressure will not be equal to aalE.

To determine the errors introduced into the measurements by these effects, it is first
necessary to determine the radial displacement at the cylindrical surface of the bar and the
distribution of longitudinal stress and displacement over the cross-section of the bar for
various values of « and a/A, and then to find the mean values of the stress and displacement
over the cross-section of the bar. The necessary equations for these quantities are easily
obtained from the relationships given by Love (1934), and the expression for the longitudinal
displacement is in fact given by Bancroft (1941).

The differences between our notation and that used by Love and by Bancroft are shown
in table 11-4. The remainder of the notation agrees with that used by Love and by Bancroft.
No confusion need arise from the fact that y, A and C are here used to denote respectively
2n/A and constants connected with the amplitude of vibration, whereas they have been used
in preceding sections to denote change in capacity, area of cross-section and capacity.
