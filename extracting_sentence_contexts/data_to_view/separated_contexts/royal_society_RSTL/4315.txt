But in the case of the Hylzosaurus the dermal bones peculiar to that animal are
easily recognizable; for not only have I found them in the typical specimen of this
reptile discovered in 1832*, but likewise in the beautiful series of vertebra already
referred to, Plate XXXII. fig. 22; in which the discoidal and oyal scutes are
Situated on each side the spinous processes of the vertebrz. The same fossil contains, at the anterior part, portions of large angular spines re-
sembling those described in my former memoir}. As the correctness of my opinion
that the large flat spines in the first-discovered specimen of the Hyleosaurus were
dermal, and extended down the back as a dorsal fringe, has been questioned by
Professor Owex, I beg to state, that since my former communication I have submitted
sections of one of these spines to microscopical examination, and if identity of
internal structure be of any value, my interpretation is substantiated ; for the same
remarkable organization is present as in the admitted dermal scutes, namely,
*straight spicular fibres decussating each other in all directions, and seeming to re-
present the ossified ligamentons fibres of the original corium ||.”

Summary —The facts described in this communication will, I trust, be regarded as
a valuable addition to our knowledge of the osteological structure of one of the most
remarkable herbivorous terrestrial quadrupeds that ever trod the surface of our
planet. With the exception of the cranium, sternum, and the bones of the fore-arm,
carpus, and tarsus, the entire skeleton may now be considered as determined. In
the present memoir the pectoral arch and the arm are for the first time described
