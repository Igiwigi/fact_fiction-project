The Order Differences——The order differences change very considerably with a
change in the value taken for the limit, 7.¢., in the value given to & No doubt with
unlimited choice of ¢ it would be possible to arrange a set of denominator differences
all multiples of the oun within error limits, for a series of values of ¢ could be found
making the first difference a multiple. Out of these one or two would probably give
the second such a multiple. After the second the error limits as a rule come to be
E very large, in fact larger than half the oun itself, except in case of very high atomic
weight. No conclusions could be drawn from any such arrangement. But in the
26 present cases the choice of ¢ is bounded by very narrow limits, for the relation
D(#)=S() is supposed to hold, and, as a rule, the values of S(c) are known

6 with very considerable accuracy, and the possible limits of variation are known.
