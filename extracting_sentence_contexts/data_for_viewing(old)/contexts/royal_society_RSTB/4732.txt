might be mistaken for pigment. Examined by transmitted light, the scales have
the appearance shown in Plate 1, fig. 23. The whole surface is covered by a
reticulation which divides it into small irregular polygonal areas, some of which,
b, are darker than others. If now the transmitted light be partly cut off, and
the scale examined by reflected light, it will appear as if covered with green
spangles which correspond to these areas. Moreover, it will be seen that the
darkest areas, by transmitted light, correspond to those that are the brightest
green by reflected light. The cause of this reticulation and the colour of the
scales has given rise to a lengthy discussion,* but the explanation is very
simple, as may be seen by examining the cross-section given in Plate 1, fig. 18.
The fine striation is formed by little round bosses, «, under which runs a
faint indication of a cuticle, but as the whole scale is pigmented, this is very
difficult to distinguish. The reticulation is due to the fact that the scale is
looped up, as at b, so as to become very thin, and consequently a white line
appears by transmitted light. In between two such thin places the scale is much
thicker. This causes the density of certain polygonal areas, as well as their bright
colour by reflected light, because an increase in the pigment of the absorbing
layer prevents the dilution of the green colour by reflected white light. A section
through two points of a scale is shown at ¢; they are oval-shaped and only striated
on the upper surface.

The formation of these iridescent scales was also studied during various stages
of pupal development. For this purpose the wings were dissected out of pupz
some time before emergence, fixed in Carnoy’s fluid, cut in the usual way, and
stained with picro-indigo-carmine, or MAnn’s stain. At first the scales develop no
