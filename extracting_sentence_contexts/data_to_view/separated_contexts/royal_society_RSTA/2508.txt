However, our calculations of the relevant forces and
phonon dispersion curves [37] have shown that there are important directional forces that favour
linear Znâ€”CN-Zn linkages and which are sufficiently strong to push the frequencies of the
transverse displacement and twist modes up to 2-4THz and around 9THz, respectively. Thus
the motions that gives a strong tension effect also increase the frequencies and hence, importantly,
decrease the mode amplitude. In fact it turns out that the NTE in Zn(CN)9 is caused primarily by
the RUM transverse acoustic modes [37,58]. The more general point is that when we consider flexibility in metal-organic frameworks we
now have an issue that is not generally so prevalent in ceramics (the exception perhaps being
Cu20), namely directional bonding. The RUM model pre-supposes flexible linkages at the joints
between the structural polyhedra, but the existence of directional forces (as clearly illustrated in
the case of Zn(CN)2 [37]) gives strong force constants that oppose the types of flexibility seen in
ceramics.
