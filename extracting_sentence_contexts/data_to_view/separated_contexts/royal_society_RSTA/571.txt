Further, no BT models have been shown to model
flooding from real tsunamis any better or as consistently as NSWE models, not to mention that
many BT models de-facto become NWSE near or post breaking [82]. Despite this inconvenient
truth, BT models have been peddled as panacea, not by mathematicians who are the most likely
to understand their convergence and appreciate their advantages, but by engineers with no prior
experience in tsunamis. The fact that the imagined benefits of BT simulations compared to the
NSWEs are lost when done at inappropriate resolution somehow escapes many modelers, who
donâ€™t even check the convergence of their schemes for their specific application. BT codes may have substantial benefits when simulating near-shore storm waves or swell
entering ports [64], but their benefits for studying tsunamis in ports remain unproved. One basic
issue here is the duration of the event.
