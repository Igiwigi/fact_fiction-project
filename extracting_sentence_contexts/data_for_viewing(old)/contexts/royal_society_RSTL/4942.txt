Some of these the body appeared to be slightly enlarged. Segmentation commenced
in very many of these ova in five hours and ten minutes, and was almost universal in
them a few minutes later. Nearly the whole of these ova produced embryos, there
being only nine out of the one hundred and thirty that were abortive. I have 8ome-
times found a much larger proportional number of unproductive ova in some broods
in the natural haunts of the Frog.

There was one exceedingly interesting fact in this experiment,â€”it was that the
smaller and apparently less matured ova were as fully impregnated as the larger and
more perfect. The whole set of observations was the more interesting from this cir-
cumstance. These ova were smaller than usual and had not the white surface s0 com-
plete, but were very like the ova in which I have described the changes in the light-
coloured surface (p. 185). When first placed in water with the filter paper and
spermatozoa, the surface of the yelks became more contracted and irregular, within
the vitelline membrane, than in other ova I have employed. Hence I had much
doubt, at first, whether any satisfactory evidence would be obtained from this set.
But the contrary has been the case, as it is evident that some ova may be impreg-
nated at a little earlier period than usual; and that when a great abundance of sper-
matozoa is supplied, ova less matured than others may be equally well impregnated.
The greater efficiency of a larger as compared with a smaller number of spermatozoa,
