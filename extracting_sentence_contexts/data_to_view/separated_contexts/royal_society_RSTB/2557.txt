around several centres of calcification without any definite position relative to calyci-
nal parts. The edge-zone may at the same time be regarded as much curtailed. In correlation
with this fact we find that increase of the colony is said to take place by means of
“central” and “parietal” intracalycinal budding. As KiunziNGER says, central
intracalycinal budding is not distinguishable from the fission (“ Theilung”) in Favia. A study of various skeletons shows that all these forms of increase are identical
with what has been called “septal budding” in fossil Palzozoic forms.
