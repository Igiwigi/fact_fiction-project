Other researchers have found that pretence may enhance
young children’s ability to reason hypothetically [25-28]. For
example, Dias & Harris [25] suggested that the fantasy con-
text may enhance children’s ability to ‘quarantine’ a given
false premise from real-world knowledge, which then
allows children to make more accurate downstream infer-
ences. Our findings are in line with these claims. By
