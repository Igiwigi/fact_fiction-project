In my own paper I noted instances in which it evoked flexion
and pronation at wrist, as well as full flexion of the thumb and fingers, both in
M. rhesus and in sinicus; also in Cercopithecus and in Cynocephalus. I have also
seen slight flexion of the wrist as a willed movement in a Macaque in which the VIth,
VIIth and VIIIth cervical and Ist thoracic roots had been cut through. In fact, it
supplies flexor profundus, flexor sublimis, palmaris longus, pronator quadratus, as well

as the muscles of the hand. In all cases the scaleni (not medius) muscles contained degenerated nerve-fibres ;

as also, vid the posterior primary division of the nerve, the erector spine and

transverso-spinales. Examined by the degeneration method and the teasing of muscle-nerves for detec-

tion of breaking down nerve-fibres, the following results were obtained in two

Macaques :â€”
