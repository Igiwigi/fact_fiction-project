The burner which was ultimately constructed free from these difficulties is that
shown in the drawing (fig. 5).

The wide tube A of the burner is divided into four narrower tubes as shown,
leading at intervals of 90° into the channel of a hollow ring cut in the brass ring,
In the hollow brass ring (AB) 12 small brass pieces containing capillary tubes were
fixed, and in the end of the brass pieces nipples were fixed. Each nipple has one
round pinhole of about 15 or 20 candle power; the holes are parallel to each other,
and each gives a flame in the form of a straight thick line of a few millimetres
diameter and of a few centimetres in height. Round the brass ring a brass jacket
is fixed, forming a hollow ring connected with the tubes + and 7’. Water runs
continuously through the hollow ring of the burner, which thus remains cool, in
spite of the fact that flames of about 200-250 candle power are concentrated in a
very small area. Using this arrangement of the burner, we find that the acetylene

flame becomes perfectly pure and clear, and remains so for any length of time, even

when the nipples have pinholes of only 15 or 20 candle power each. The clear
circular flame so obtained consists of lines interrupted by narrow air spaces. Having
all twelve lines in a narrow circle of only 1 or 14 inch diameter, at equal distances
from one another, the direction of all the flames perpendicular, and the flames of
