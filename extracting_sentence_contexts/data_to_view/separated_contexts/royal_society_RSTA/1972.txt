These have given (p. 346) for

a first approximation to 6, the value 249°30 from », and 249°6 from the two alternative

v's, . The vs are so ill-determined that these might possibly refer to values giving

the same 6. But the fact that the value of ¢ calculated from A, agrees so closely

with the maximum ordinate in the corresponding oceurrency curve (Plate 2, fig. 1)

shows that A, must be exceedingly close to the true value, in which case it is
