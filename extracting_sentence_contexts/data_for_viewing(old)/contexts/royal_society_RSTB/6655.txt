e MORPHOLOGY OF THE TEETH OF ORNITHORHYNCHUS 417

GreEGorY (1934, Pp. 192) points out that Bok failed to explain the causal relations
between the enamel niche and the enamel septum and merely assumed that they were
parts of the same phenomenon. Certainly the fact that a niche is present and a septum
is absent in Ornithorhynchus provides a striking example of the dissociation of these
structures. Referring to the vascularity of the septum in Phascolarctus, GREGORY fails
to see that Bork has proved anything beyond the possibility of nutriment being carried
via the septum to the crown of the tooth, and, since it is distributed on each side of the
septum, two growth centres appear in the enamel organ. While Grecory does not
advance any explanation for the presence of the enamel niche, he suggests that it may
represent a secondary vacuity developed in the dental lamina.

Finally, BoLk attempted to derive the diphyodont condition of the mammalian
dentition from the polyphyodonty of the reptiles by showing that the latter possessed
a “‘distichical”’ dentition and that in the mammals the “‘ exostichos”’ (whose members
always form first in the embryo) erupt first as the milk dentition, to be followed later
