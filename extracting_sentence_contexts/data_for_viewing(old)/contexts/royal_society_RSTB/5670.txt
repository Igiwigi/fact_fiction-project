(2) Fumago vagans Purs., Catalogue No. Ag. 92. Purchased from Baarn.

The carbon balance sheets for these two species are given in Table XI. In the
case of Fumago vagans, Ag. 92, two balance sheets are given. The first one, B 14,
was prepared from a culture grown on the usual CzAPEK-Dox solution containing
0-2 per cent. sodium nitrate as the source of nitrogen. The second balance sheet for
this species, B 14 (X), was prepared from a culture grown on a similar CzaprK-Dox
solution in which, however, 0-2 per cent. ammonium nitrate was used as the source
of nitrogen in place of the usual 0-2 per cent. sodium nitrate.

Both species of Fumago give balance sheets which are decidedly interesting fiom
a biochemical point of view, although they are slightly different in type, because of the
fact that, while Ag. 63 gives appreciable amounts of volatile neutral compounds
(0-320 gm.), Ag. 92 gives only a negligible amount of the same type of compound
(0-010 gm.). Of particular interest is the large amount of “carbon unaccounted
for” given by both species and amounting to 0-512 gm. (15 per cent. of the glucose
fermented) for Ag. 63, 0-965 gm. (19-8 per cent.) for Ag. 92 on sodium nitrate, and
0-468 gm. (19-5 per cent.) for Ag. 92 on ammonium nitrate. Another interesting
feature is the relatively high titratable acidity and “carbon in non-volatile acids,”
which amounts to 0-189 gm. (5-4 per cent.) for Ag. 63, 0-407 gm. (8-4 per cent.)
for Ag. 92 on sodium nitrate, and 0-268 gm. (11 per cent.) for Ag. 92 on ammonium
nitrate. There is also a very marked difference in the percentage of glucose estimated
by the polarimeter and SHarrer-Hartmann methods, for, with Ag. 92 on sodium
nitrate, the respective figures are 0-344 and 0-043 per cent., while with the same
species on ammonium nitrate the figures are 1-709 and 1-300 per cent. It is thus
