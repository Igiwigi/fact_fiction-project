THE AERODYNAMICS OF A SPINNING SHELL, 305

assumption that L and M are unaffected by the angular velocity of the axis. But
the values we obtain are too rough to enable us to study the variations of fy with
any argument. ,

1.12. The Effect of the Axial Spin of the Shell.—We have so far ignored the possible effect of the spin N
of the shell about its axis of symmetry. We shall assume that the preceding components of the force
system R, L, M and H are not appreciably affected by this spin. This is in accordance with such evidence
as exists in the case of zero yaw (§ 1.01). If, moreover, the component M were seriously affected by the
spin, the effect would have been detected by the present trial. No such effect was found (see § 4.13), and
this fact provides some evidence of the validity of the above assumption, at least as a first approximation.

The spin N will, however, give rise to certain additional components of the complete force system.
There will be a couple I which tends to destroy N, and, when the shell is yawed, a sideways force, which
need not act through the centre of gravity, analogous to that producing swerve on a golf or tennis ball.
This foree must, by symmetry, vanish with the yaw. The swerving force must act normal to the plane
of yaw, otherwise it would merely have a component which altered R or L (acting in the plane of yaw),
and we have assumed that no such component exists. The complete effects of the spin N can therefore
be represented by the addition to the force system of the couples I and J and the force K, acting as
shown in fig. 3. To procure the correct dimensions we may assume that those components have the
