"This is the quantity which gives an upper limit to the resistance. The first term,
which corresponds to the component of the velocity, is the same as that previously
obtained for the lower limit, as might have been foreseen. The difference between the
two, which gives the utmost error involved in taking either of them as the true yalue, is

In a nearly cylindrical tube 2 is a small quantity, and 80 the result found by this

method is closely approximate. It is not necessary that the section of the tube 8hould
be nearly constant, but only that it should vary slowly. The 8uccess of the approxima-
tion in this and similar cases depends in great measure on the fact that the quantity to
be estimated is a minimum. Any reasonable approximation to the real motion will give
a vis viva very near the minimum, according to the principles of the differential calculus.

For the lower limit to the resistance we have
