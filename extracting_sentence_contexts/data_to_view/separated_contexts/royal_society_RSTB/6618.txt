(1929, a, p. 309) discusses the homology of the sulcus rectus, and reaches a conclusion
in harmony with the above. Two facts so far stand out : firstly, the areas 6 and 8 remain in relation to area 4 ;
secondly, area 10 retains its relation to the frontal pole. The fundamental sulci
of the frontal lobe in the Cercopithecidae become separated from one another in a
way analogous to the separation of the sulcus lunatus from the sylvian and parallel
sulci in man. One other area remains fixed in position and gives the key to the solution of the
problem of the position of the expansion of the frontal cortex.
