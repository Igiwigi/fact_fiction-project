It is often argued that the RBC
membrane may be easily deformed keeping the constant area [45,46], hence, it was suggested
to model the membranes as a two-dimensional incompressible material. On the other hand, it
was stated that the RBC modelled as a nonlinear elastic membrane filled with an incompressible
fluid [46]. In fact, the internal space of the cell is not just fluid, but a kind of a fibrous composite
material containing some fibres specialized to withstand tension and the others specialized in
withstanding compression, i.e. it has a hierarchical molecular structure that is stabilized based on
tensegrity principles [47]. Very simple geometrical estimations show that the assumption of two-
dimensional incompressible material in application to all cell membranes is not correct. Indeed,
let the initial cell shape be spherical of diameter D (radius R = D/2) and the cell be fully filled by
the fluid.
