as an ecosystem in itself, with many co-existing and interacting
agents. Many plasmids, for example, inhabit cells with at least
one other plasmid [40], and there are diverse mechanisms by
which plasmids can interact to affect conjugation, co-infection
and fitness costs [41]. The implication of such plasmid ‘co-infec-
tion’ is formally investigated in a framework presented by Igler
et al. [42]. A salient feature of their models is the emergence of
frequency-dependent selection, which varies in nature from
positive to negative depending on epistasis between the plas-
mids. Where plasmids reduce one anothers’ costs, the co-
infected state is favoured, causing rare plasmids to spread,
whereas if plasmids exacerbate one anothers’ costs then rare
plasmids are suppressed by dominant ones. The fact that the
presence of other plasmids in a community can dramatically
affect plasmid fate underlines the importance of considering
the effects of a plasmid in the context of other MGEs.

Conflicts and collaborations between MGEs also extend
across MGE types. In a series of experiments extended and
explored with deterministic modelling, Igler et al. [43] investi-
gate how conjugative plasmids and integrative prophages
affect each other’s transmission. Though neither the plasmid
nor the phage used in their experiments (lambda and RP4)
contained systems known to directly interfere with transfer,
they found that prophages limited conjugative plasmid
