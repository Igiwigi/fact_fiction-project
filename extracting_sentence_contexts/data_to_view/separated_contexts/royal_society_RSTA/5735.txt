In §6, we study the implications of sync to
the possibility of eventual convergence to a common sequence of values of two BKL maps that
correspond to two different spatial points, and discuss the resulting physical interpretation of the
effects of sync. We conclude in the last section with a discussion of other issues not considered in
the present work, as well as further conjectural implications that follow directly from our results.

2. Evolution of spatial Mixmaster points

It is a basic fact that in the inhomogeneous Mixmaster model each spatial point evolves like a separate
homogeneous Mixmaster universe as we approach the initial singularity. This characteristic property
of the model plays a central role in BKL and in more recent approaches to the problem, and leads :
to formulations of the Einstein field equations as systems of partial differential equations where —
conjectures about the properties of the solutions have been formulated. In this paper, we follow [3
a simpler approach that focuses instead on the behaviour of the interaction of two neighbouring Dm
spatial points on approach to the singularity.
