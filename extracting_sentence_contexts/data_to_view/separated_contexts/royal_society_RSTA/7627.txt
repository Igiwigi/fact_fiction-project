However, they
‘B could perhaps be made in a number of pieces and then mounted in line. It will be noticed that Vectolite, a sintered oxide powder, gives almost the same
performance as Ticonal K for £<0-25. Though in principle one can obtain as low a value of G(f) as one pleases by making £
small enough, the fact that, according to (19a), G(f) varies only slowly with #, makes it
necessary to go to very long and thin transverse magnets to gain very much. Thus to reduce
B from 0-05 to 0-01 would only give a reduction of H, in the ratio of 1 to 1/5' = 0-59. Such
; long and thin magnets could only easily be made of a ductile material such as Vicalloy

which can be drawn into wire.
