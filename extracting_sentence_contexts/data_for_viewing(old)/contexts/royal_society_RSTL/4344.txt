MR. T, H. HUXLEY ON THE AFFINITIES OF THE MEDUSR. 425

SECTION IT.—Of the Afinities of the Medusc.

56. Certain general conelusions are deducible from the facts stated in the pre-
ceding section. It would appear, —

Ist. That a Medusa consists essentially of two membranes inclosing a variously-
sbaped cavity, inasmuch as its various organs are 80 composed (7, 8, 14, 21, 22, 29,
33, 38, 39, &c.).

2ndly. That the generative organs are external, being variously developed processes
of the two membranes (38, 39, 42, 48, 49); and

3rdly. That the peculiar organs called thread-cells are universally present (7, 15,
31, 32).
