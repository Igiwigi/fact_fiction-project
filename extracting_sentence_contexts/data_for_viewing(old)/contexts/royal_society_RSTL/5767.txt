axially and equatorially, as they do in the general case, the position of a uniaxal
crystal, when suspended between the two poles along any of its diameters, is imme-
diately obtained. Here the axis of revolution, 7. e. the magnetic axis of the crystal,
when projected on the horizontal plane, is one of these two axes, the other being the
intersecting line of the equatorial plane of the ellipsoid and the horizontal plane. If
the crystal be positive, this intersecting line is coincident with the shorter axis of the
elliptical section within the horizontal plane; if it be negative, with the longer axis,
Hence a paramagnetic crystal, when positive, sets its magnetic axis in the axial,
when negative in the equatorial plane of the electro-magnet. In diamagnetic crystals,
when positive, the magnetic axis is forced into the equatorial, when negative into the
axial plane. In order to give a true description of this fact, you may say, in all cases the
magnetic axis of the crystal is either attracted or repelled by the poles.

This law can easily be verified in a most distinct way by a great number of paramag-
netic and diamagnetic, positive and negative crystals. I think it therefore not necessary
to refer here to new experiments.

66. In most cases the magnetic axis is known, if not, it can easily be found by
suspending the crystal along any two vertical axes. Mark in both suspensions if the
crystal be positive and paramagnetic, or negative and diamagnetic, on its surface the
axial plane, if it be positive and diamagnetic, or negative and paramagnetic, the equato-
rial plane; in both cases the line of intersection within the crystal of the two planes
marked on its surface is the magnetic axis.
