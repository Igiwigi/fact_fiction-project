+ nerve organ preparation in response to excitation of its nerve is of sufficient intensity
3 to produce a similar change in another strip through which its current is led. The
‘= evidence is in all cases the difference in the readings when this second strip is placed
“£ so that its response shall alternately augment and diminish that of the primary nerve
‘& organ preparation. It will be noticed that such augmentation and diminution occurs
8 at about 1/100” after the maximum of the primary nerve organ response has been
S reached. Now, if the current of the primary response can thus excite an isolated
5 strip of organ, it must much more excite its own tissue, for only a derivation passes
© through the isolated strip. In this connexion an observation of Joyer occurred to
me, which I state from memory. He noticed in a vigorous fish that his chronograph,
which was connected with the end surfaces of the organ columns of a brainless
Torpedo, gave, in response to a single excitation of electrical nerves, a wavy
fluctuating movement. This he attributed to the fact that, owing to the slow rate of
transmission in the electrical nerves of the Torpedo, the excitatory change was
probably initiated at different times in different parts of the organ mass. I had
myself observed a still more remarkable instance of the same phenomenon.
In making a nerve organ preparation from a vigorous Torpedo, the brain of which
had been destroyed, I held a small mass of cut-out organ grasped between the fingers
