Also, it must be borne in mind that the total distance for
which this plexus travels is very short and small in comparison with the size of the
tissues composing it. Bundle-schemes constructed in fine lines, which give no clue to
the relation of the component elements to the adjacent cells, may readily create
a false impression; so that judgment may be suspended until cell drawings are
available. The fact which does emerge from these differing published accounts is
that the plexus is a fairly simple symmetrical bundle-meshwork confined to a
definite region. Its function is sufficiently obvious: it supplies the pyriform nucellus
with an evenly distributed water supply, as a girdle and four free strands symme-
trically arranged ; just as a very similar plexus does in the more extended ovule of
the ovulate flower ; and here again, when we know the importance of the function
of the system, the assumed phylogenetic value of the scheme, as indicative of
hypothetical carpels, appears not so much far fetched as completely beyond the
range of the evidence. On the other hand, a floral form in which the gyneecium, originally composed of
free carpels, had not only passed on to a condition of complete synearpy, but had
even lost all outward sign of the original carpel members, and had subsequently
reduced the gyncecium to a mere rudiment, and much more rudimentary in the
functional flower than in the staminate one, would have no claim to be regarded as
a Pro-Angiosperm, since the limit of reduction-specialisation in the highest
Angiosperm phyla can do no more than this at the present time.
