We now claim that the following three types of operators form a set of beables:

1
pate, sa(p-o) and r=5(b-x+x-p). (3.3)

The sign in the first equation is arbitrary; it could be defined such that p3 > 0. The equations of
motion for these operators are derived as follows:

d . d d

and a? x) a P)=p-o, (3.7)
so that we have
d d d

a? 0, a 0 an qa (3.8)
Furthermore, we have
[P.s]=0, [p,r]=0 and [s,r]=0. 9)

The first of these is obvious, and the last follows from the second. The fact that [p,r] =0 can be
found by explicit calculation, but also understood as a consequence of the fact that, in momentum
space, r is the dilation operator divided by |p|, while p is invariant under dilations (its norm
stays one).

3In this section, the caret (°) is reserved for vectors normalized to 1, not operators. Together, equations (3.8) and (3.9) thus obey equation (2.11). The best way to describe these 6 |
observables physically is to say that they represent a sheet moving with the speed of light in one
of the two possible orthogonal directions. “a
This is why we claim that the ontological theory behind a ‘neutrino’ is an infinite sheet moving 1B
with velocity v =c in one of its two possible orthogonal directions.
