Diaplanosoma, The gnathobases of the second to fifth trunk limbs of Holopedium
gibberum are very similar to those of Sida, but while in the latter the posterior corner
projects directly backwards, the lower edge of the gnathobase being parallel to the
floor of the food groove, in Holopedium the posterior corner points distinctly away from
the body, the lower edge forming an angle of about 45Â° with the floor of the food groove,
fig. 11 ; that is, the posterior corner is swinging up towards the more distal endites.

In Diaphanosoma the process which is seen
commencing in Holopedium is almost complete.
The gnathobases of the second to fifth trunk
limbs have swung up so that their posterior
corners nearly reach the edge of the second
endite, fig. 12. In fact, in a median view of
the limbs it is difficult to tell at first sight where
the gnathobase ends and where the second
endite begins. This point, however, is clearly
marked by the claw-bearing ridge which car-
ries the same two spines, a very long posterior
one with a curved claw in front of it. The
sete of the distal endites thus form an almost
unbroken series with those of the gnathobase.
I do not think that any worker has denied
that the distal sete are filter sete. That
being so, it cannot be maintained that the
