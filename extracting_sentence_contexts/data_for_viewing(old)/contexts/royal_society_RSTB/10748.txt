6. Implications beyond equids: an argument for
long-term socioecological studies

The work discussed here suggests a different sort of relation-
ship between a species’ ecology and its behaviour or social
structure than one in which the former ‘pushes’ the latter
(as in the early precursors to socioecological models) or
even a bidirectional relationship wherein environments
