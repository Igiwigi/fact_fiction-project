Instead, geometries were based on metrical considerations that could be empirically investigated. The empiricist response was to consider the axioms of both mechanics and geometry as true only
to the extent that they were supported by experience until now. Gravitational action at a distance had been adopted by Newton as an empirically verified fact,
standing in until such time as a more satisfactory and fundamental theory of locally acting forces
could be developed. On astronomical scales, where the size of celestial bodies could be considered
insignificant compared to the distances between them and constraints were not important, the
assumption of action at a distance in Euclidean space according to a central force governed by
an inverse square law worked well. Through the eighteenth century, driven by a desire to reduce
the discrepancy between astronomical observations and Newtonian mechanics, mathematicians


such as Euler, dâ€™Alembert, Lagrange and Laplace had developed techniques of approximation
and variation which allowed them to handle many-body problems.
