a partition of unity (gen , subordinate to (Uj yy: In other words, (Uj, Oia is an atlas for the
C?-manifold 82. Multiplying (2.3) with gj leads to a localized perturbed version in Uj. Since the
Stokes equations are invariant under rotations and translations, by choosing Uj sufficiently small,
we may assume that the localized version is either an equation on R" or on a bent half-space

Hy = {x ER": xn > hy(x’)}, (2.4)
with a certain bending function hj : R” 1 _, R. We further transform the localized system on H, [j as
V(X Xn) = (Wo MY, Xn) = UL Xn +HG(X’)), Xn) ERY. (2.5)

The resulting system for v then is an equation on R?.. Summarizing, by this procedure the Stokes
resolvent problem on a domain is reduced to finitely many equations on R'} or R".

A fundamental problem arising here is the fact that div u = 0 is not preserved, neither under
multiplication with a cut-off function nor by transformation (2.5). This might be the reason why
proofs of the analyticity of the Stokes semigroup on domains rely on different methods and
different assumptions are being imposed, depending on the approaches being used.

In order to start the above localization procedure various representation formulas for the
solution of the Stokes equation on the half space R'| have been developed by Solonnikov [33],
McCracken [34], Ukai [35] and Desch, Hieber & Priiss [15]. All these formulae imply, in particular,
that the associated Stokes operator generates an analytic semigroup on L5 (R3) for 1 <p < oo. The
main result concerning domains with smooth boundaries reads then as follows.

Theorem 2.6. Let n> 2, 1 <p <oo and assume that 2 C R" is a standard domain of class C3. Then
