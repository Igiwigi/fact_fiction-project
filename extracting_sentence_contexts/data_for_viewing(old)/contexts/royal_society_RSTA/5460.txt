Figure 2. (a) Hubble Space Telescope image of the first gravitationally lensed source, the high-
redshift quasar SBS 0957 + 561. The two nearly comparable images of the same background source
are produced by the lensing effect of a foreground elliptical galaxy. (b) The remarkable ‘giant arc’
in the rich cluster of galaxies, Abell 370. The image is that of a distant galaxy distorted by the
gravitational potential of the foreground cluster.

sources in the 1970s did it finally become likely that one would be found
behind a foreground galaxy. The first example, SBS 0957 + 561 A/B, was verified
spectroscopically by Walsh et al. (1979) to represent two images of the same
distant (redshift z= 1.413) quasar. The lensing galaxy has a redshift z= 0.355
(figure 2a).

The third limiting factor in locating lensed images arises from the fact that
surface brightness is conserved in the lensing process (as it is in conventional
optics). Howev brightness dims with increased redshift z as (1+ z)4
due to relativistic effects associated with the expansion of the Universe, many
lensed images viewed through galaxy clusters were simply too faint to be detected
and lay undiscovered until the 1980s when charge-coupled devices became
common on large ground-based telescopes. The increased sensitivity led to the
discovery in the mid-1980s of giant arcs such as that viewed in the cluster Abell
370 (z= 0.37, figure 2b). For a few years, there was some speculation as to the
origin of these strange features. Eventually, Soucail et al. (1988) confirmed, with a
spectrum, that the arc in Abell 370 is the distorted image of a single background
galaxy at redshift z= 0.724.
