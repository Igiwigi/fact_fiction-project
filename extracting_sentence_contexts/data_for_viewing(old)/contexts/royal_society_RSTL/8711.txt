113. In the present Annex I in part reproduce GREEN's process for the integration of
this equation by means of a series of functions analogous to LapLace's Functions, and
which may be termed © Greenians” (se his Memoir on the Attraction of Ellipsoids,
referred to above); each such function gives rise to a Prepotential Integral.

GREEN $hows, by a complicated and difficult piece of general reasoning, that there
exist s0lutions of the form V=Og (see post, No. 116), where @ is a function of the s
new variables &, 3... y without 0, such that VÞ=zo, x being a function of 9 only; these
functions $6 of the variables «, Þ...y are in fact the Greenian Functions in question.
The function of the order 0 is @=1; those of the order 1 are p=s, Pp=Þ... 6=y;
those of the order 2 are $=&}, &c., and s-functions each of the form

HAG&+BP#... +0Of}+D.

The existence of the functions just referred to other than the s-functions involving the
squares of the variables is obvious enough; the difficulty first arises in regard to these
+functions; and the actual development of them appears to me important by reason of
the light which is thereby thrown upon the general theory. This I accomplish in the
present Annex; and I determine by Greg's process the corresponding prepotential
integrals. I do not go into the question of the Greenian Functions of orders superior
to the second.
