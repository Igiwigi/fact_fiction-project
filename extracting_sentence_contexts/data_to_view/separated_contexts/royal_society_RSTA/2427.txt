As stated above, improvements in energy confinement if demonstrated in ITER and JT60SA
could reduce the size of such a reactor slightly. However, machines as envisaged in some reactor
studies (ARIES) which would have the size of ITER (R = 6.2m) and produce 2 GW fusion power
are in the opinion of the author close to science fiction and thus do not represent a realistic
prediction for a fusion reactor. Also, a high field machine where the size could be smaller will not
reduce the cost significantly due to the more substantial structure needed for the magnets and due
to the fact that the cost of the balance of plant will be driven by the fusion power produced and
not the machine size. All other arguments for the amount of power which needs to be produced
remain the same as above.

(b) Technology needed and status of development to enable the construction
of a reactor

While the technology developed for ITER can be used for many parts of a reactor, e.g. magnets,
heating & current drive, diagnostics, etc., in several areas such as for the blanket, the divertor,

structural-, functional- and plasma facing materials, tritium handling, remote maintenance and
possibly also magnets, new technologies and new approaches are needed.

(c) In-vessel components

One of the most complex systems which needs to be developed is the in-vessel components of
a fusion reactor.
