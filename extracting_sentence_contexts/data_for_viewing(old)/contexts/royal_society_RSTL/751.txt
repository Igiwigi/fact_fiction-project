not that body, which has of all others the most decided relation
to heat, or highest specific heat, to have also its ratio most
decidedly or rapidly augmented ? In adopting the increasing
specific heat of water, we must farther assume, that, however
different the initial specific heats of the above three liquids may
be, yet, while they possess all the same rate of increase, water
alone has a different one; an inadmissible supposition, All


382 Dr. Urz's new experimental researches

these difficulties and contradictions are removed at once by
the experimental fact, that water is endowed with a de-
creasing ratio in its capacity for caloric, as its temperature is
augmented.

Since finishing the above researches on specific heat, I have
been led to examine attentively the systematic accounts of
this subject in our chemical treatises; and I find that Ber-
THOLLET, With a sagacity peculiar to himself, had anticipated,
from the chemical constitution of bodies, such an experimental
result as I have recently obtained ; though the statements
then prevalent all militated against his views. « If caloric

« quantity, relative to the body to which it is united, it will
