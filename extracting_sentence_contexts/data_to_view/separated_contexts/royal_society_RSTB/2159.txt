Tetanisation by alternating makes and breaks is a particularly complicated case,
inasmuch as we have unequally exciting currents that elicit unequal polarisation
currents. Once outside the clear case of a large positive effect or after-effect caused
by both directions of tetanisation, matters become exceedingly complicated. We
shall find it necessary for further intelligence of the facts to study the effects of
single induction shocks and of single condenser discharges. We shall also do well to
avoid for the present further complication by considering the effects upon retinal
responses of other than the first stage. For these reasons I shall at present limit myself to the statement that the normal
living eyeball during the first few hours after excision is predisposed towards the
manifestation of positive current when excited by tetanising currents of any direction.
