are retained, may be seen in his invaluable memoir. Mr. Brxics Broxwin has
recently communicated to the Society a lunar theory, in which the same
method is adopted.

Having reflected much upon the difficulties of this problem, I am led to
believe that the integration of the differential equations in which the time is
the independent variable, is at least as easy as the method hitherto, I think,
solely employed, and I now have the honour to submit to the Society a lunar
theory founded upon this integration, which is in fact merely an extension
of the equations given in my Researches in Physical Astronomy, already printed,
by embracing those terms which, in consequence of the magnitude of the
eccentricity of the moon's orbit, are sensible ; and the suppression of those,
on the other hand, which are insensible on account of the great distance of the
sun, the disturbing body. By means of the Table which I have given (Table I1.),
the developments may all be effected at once with the greatest facility.

The first column contains the indices, which I have employed to distinguish
the inequalities. The numbers in the second column are the indices affixed
by M. Damo1sgav, in the M6m. snr la Th6&or. de la Lune, p. 547. to the inequa-
lities of longitude.
