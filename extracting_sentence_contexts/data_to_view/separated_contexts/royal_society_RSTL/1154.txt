The latter, however, seems rather to act
on the sulphur than on the molybdzna ; but the former com-
municates oxygen to both, 80 as to convert the one into sul-
phuric and the other into molybdic acid,

The rapidity with which nitric acid oxygenates molybdzna,
even to supersaturation, resembles the effects produced by the
same acid on some other metallic substances, particularly tin ; ©

for in both cases the acid ceases to act as s0on as the supersa-
turation with oxygen is effected ; and on this account the nitric
acid is unable to dissolve the molybdic acid. Before I proceed, I'must obserye that whenever a solution of
the molybdic acid becomes blue, or tending towards that co-
lour, it is a certain sign that the molybdic acid has sufftered a
diminution of oxygen. A. variety of facts which prove this, v
have been already brought forward in the different experi-
ments contained in this paper ; and I shall soon have occasion
to mention others. Sulphuric acid can dissolve a considerable quantity of mo-
lybdic acid; and the $olution. is always more or less of a blue
colour according to the quantity which is dissolved ;.
