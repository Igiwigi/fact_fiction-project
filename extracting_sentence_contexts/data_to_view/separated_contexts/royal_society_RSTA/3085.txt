The periodicity corresponding to the time of revolution of Jupiter (11Â°86 years)
has been examined, but reference to Table IV. shows that there is no evidence of a
periodicity connected with the orbital revolution of that planet. In fact, we may
definitely assert that no influence directly traceable to Jupiter exists. 7. It has been stated that in the absence of definite periods the expectancy of the
intensity of the periodogram must be obtained from the periodogram itself in all
cases where the events to be analysed are not, as regards their succession, independent
of each other.
