Triethylphosphine unites with bromine and iodine, evolving con-
siderable heat, which may give rise to inflammation ; but if the action be moderated,
crystalline compounds are produced. . In cyanogen gas the phosphorus-base is converted
into a brown resinous mass. If a piece of sulphur be thrown into a test-tube containing
