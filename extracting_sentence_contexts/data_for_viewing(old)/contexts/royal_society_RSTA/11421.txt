If the reader asks why is not the intensity reduced in this case in the same
manner that we find it reduced in the case of the inheritance from the dam, the
reply is :

- (i) In the case of the dam and mare, both quantities to be correlated are liable to
fictitious values. In the case of sire and mare, we deal with only one.

* A fecundity unit is taken to be 1/15, for this is the unit of grouping.

(ii.) The influence of fictitious values has been shown on pp. 276-277 to chiefly
affect the coefficient of correlation and not the standard deviation.

Now the present result is based solely on the calculation of standard deviations,
or on the variability of fecundity as a whole and in arrays. It is accordingly not
influenced to nearly the same extent by the existence of fictitious values. Could we
calculate the variability of the arrays of daughters due to individual mares, we
should probably get a better result for inheritance in the female line.*

The above result is so satisfactory that I have little doubt that we have deter-—
mined a very good value for oy/1 — p®. Substituting it we find for the correlation
between half-sisters :
