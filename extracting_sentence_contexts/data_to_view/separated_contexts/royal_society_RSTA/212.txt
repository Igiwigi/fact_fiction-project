Because the terms Z,, Y, and (a+), are not mathematical functions, this integral must
be evaluated graphically or by Simpson’s rule; using the latter method ayer 100 A intervals
of wave-length, pairs of («+/) values for the selected green- and red-film combinations of
table 3 have been calculated over arbitrary depth ranges for a number of the water types
given in figure 2; the results are summarized in table 4. As a check, one set of the integrations

was repeated using the term E - oH] in place of the term [ —aG+hh, in equation (9);

the results are given in the final columns of table 4, and it will be seen that the effect on the
original pairs of («+/?) values is in fact negligible.

SELECTED GREEN AND RED FILTER-FILM COMBINATIONS
These (a+?) values are based on common logarithms and ft.~!. To base them on Naperian logarithms and m.~',

divide by the factor 0-132.
