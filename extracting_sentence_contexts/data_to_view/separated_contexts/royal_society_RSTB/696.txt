In fig. 3 we find this are converted into a solid terete bundle from which all recog-
nizable cells have disappeared. This example bears, in an important manner, upon
some questions about to be considered. Had such a succession of different conditions
merely been detected in an unconnected manner in several distinct but homologous
bundles, even in the same plant, though the facts might have given us strong grounds
for concluding that one and the same bundle could undergo similar alterations of
structure in the several parts of its continuous course, we should have had no absolute
proof that such changes did take place. But in the example quoted above we have
positive demonstration that such changes are not only possible, but that they do
actually occur. The several sections referred to above, were prepared with the
utmost care and exactitude, and represent the changes undergone by the same
identical bundle between its first separation from the primary tracheal cylinder to its
arrival at the outermost zone of the cortex.
