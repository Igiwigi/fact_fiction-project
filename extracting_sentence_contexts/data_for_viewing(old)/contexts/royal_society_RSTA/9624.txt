at a given temperature in such an experiment with the maximum in the positive ion
current in the non-equilibrium emission curves at the same temperature such as those

given in fig. 4. The ratio of the two peak currents is found to be one to two to within
a few per cent. In the experiments in which the filament is being continuously
bombarded by atoms we must expect the adsorbed atoms to be distributed in a
uniform phase over the emitting surface. The fact that in these experiments only
one side of the filament is being bombarded and that the peak current is one half
that obtained in the non-equilibrium experiments when both faces of the filament are
covered with adsorbed atoms shows quite definitely that in the non-equilibrium
experiments also the adsorbed layer does not split up into two phases as it does with
caesium on tungsten. In the results published by Taytor and Lanemurr, the
maximum positive ion current from a tungsten filament at a certain temperature
when the whole of the emitting surface is bombarded continuously by caesium atoms
is four times that observed when caesium is deposited and the filament is subsequently
heated to the same temperature.

The fact that the emission curves, fig. 4, all rise to the same peak value shows that the
thickness of the oxide is uniform to a high degree of accuracy, for otherwise we should
