The Japanese records inform us
‘that the tobacco plant is not a native of Japan and that tobacco-leaves were first
traded to the country by the Portuguese (Namban) towards the close of the sixteenth
century....The word tabako used by the Japanese in both their literature and collo-
quial speech is based on the Spanish-Portuguese form tabaco.’

‘The Portuguese, however, are not responsible for the transmission of the tobacco
plant into China. This is outwardly demonstrated by the word ¢an-ba-ku or tam-ba-ku
under which tobacco first became known in Fu-kien Province in the beginning of the
seventeenth century when the Ming dynasty was still in power. The Fukienese were
enterprising mariners and maintained regular intercourse with the Philippines, in
particular with the island of Luzon, several centuries prior to the Spaniards’ conquest
and colonization.’ On p. 4, Laufer says: ‘No species of the genus Nicotiana is a native
of China; in fact, none is indigenous in any other part of Asia. Nor can there be any
doubt that the species first introduced into China from Luzon was Nicotiana tabacum,
the typical species of America, the species with large cabbage-like leaves and purple
flowers. This becomes perfectly evident from the descriptions of the plant in the early
Chinese sources.
