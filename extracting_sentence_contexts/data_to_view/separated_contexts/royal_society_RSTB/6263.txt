This is shown diagrammatically in fig. 1, and it will be seen that, with the exception
of the month of August, the figures fit very closely
to the expected results of low difference in June, — =06
gradually increasing towards the autumn. The low

value for August is undoubtedly due to the fact — .-
that in two of the three years the full moons were — ra be
warmer than the no moon periods in this month. = —0-3

A daily difference of 0-31 in the logs asin May _ ie

and June is equivalent to a doubling of the catch at
no moon over full moon, while the daily difference — —O1
of 0-65 in October is equivalent to an increase of

over four times. May June July Aug Sept Oct

Day-to-Day Departures of Logarithms from the
29-Day Mean

In order to extend the analysis to include all the moon.
days of the lunar period, the value for each night of
the eighteen lunar months has been expressed as a departure of log (n + 1) from
the twenty-nine-day running mean. This, as has been explained, reduces the
swamping effect of high individual catches and eliminates, at least partially, the
effect of the rise and fall of the mean catch during the year.
