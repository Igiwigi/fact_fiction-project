But the world’s surface has been almost completely over-run, without disclosing

erence having been made above to the part played by sterilization in the
ment of the sporophyte in the Bryophyta, and its progressive steps being
hilo in those plants than elsewhere, it will be well to examine the facts
y recognized in them, before proceeding to the study of the Vascular Cryp-
ams. There is good reason to believe that the latter were derived from some
gal-Bryophytic ancestry, so that observations of progressive elaboration in the
ge and Bryophyta may be reasonably accepted as suggestive of similar progress
the course of evolution of vascular plants. In the simplest plants showing antithetic alternation, viz., certain Confervoideze,
e zygote undergoes on germination a subdivision of its protoplasmic body into a
imber of parts; there is, however, no differentiation of these, all are alike capable
acting as carpospores, and producing new individuals.
