It seems reasonable to suppose therefore that our reticulated cells,
reckoned on a percentage of the total number of red blood corpuscles, would have
fallen to or almost to its sea-level value. In other words, the increase in number of
reticulated cells in a count (and this is very marked) goes hand in hand with the
increase in the total number of red cells, just as the increase in the number of
children, say of two years old, follows that of the general population. The most
reasonable construction to put upon the above facts seems to be the following :â€”On
reaching a high altitude there is a considerable growth both in the degree of activity
and the actual amount of red marrow. As time goes on, and as an equilibrium is
reached, the heightened activity passes off, but an increased quantity of marrow,
proportional to the increased number of blood corpuscles in the body, remains, This
marrow is normal in character, it is merely hypertrophied. If then we may regard
the marrow as an organ, we have an instance of the hypertrophy of an organ in man
brought about by a climatic change, namely, exposure to low barometric pressure.
