5. Implementation and efficiency

Common LB schemes are characterized by a separation between a local collision step, which
characterizes the physical properties of the model, and a generic, non-local streaming step.
The collision step is usually carried out by manipulating the component of the populations that


deviates from equilibrium, through a linear term, as in the straightforward BGK model [49], or
a more general expression, as in multiple-relaxation-time approaches [4]. A crucial importance
is therefore attributed to the explicit calculation of the equilibrium term, as a function of the
macroscopic variables density, velocity and temperature. As a matter of fact, the expression of
the equilibrium distribution can be considered to entirely determine the physics expressed by the
model [94,95], if and only if the different non-equilibrium contributions are relaxed to recover the
correct transport coefficients of the macroscopic equations of interest (see [96] for a systematic
approach in the context of fluid mechanics).

While LB models frequently approximate the equilibrium through an explicitly constructed
polynomial expression [4,5], the present paper follows the path of DVMs and adopts
a computationally more expensive approach of exponential-of-polynomial expression with
iteratively computed coefficients, as extensively discussed in [29,30]. Here, the equilibrium is
computed through the following process described in ยง2d where V = 39 and M = 13.

The computational expense of this algorithm is dominated by the inversion of the Jacobian J.
