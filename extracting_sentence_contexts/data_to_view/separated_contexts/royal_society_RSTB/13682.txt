Alternatively, the energy savings of nonag- quo (limited assessment of power, comparing dissimilar
gressive means of power may be insufficient to lead to their phenomena lumped under the term dominance hierarchy)

gressive means may vary across taxa, perhaps explaining
why social styles have strong phylogenetic signals in the
