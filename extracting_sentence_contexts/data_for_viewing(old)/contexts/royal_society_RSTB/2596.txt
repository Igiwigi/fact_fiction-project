irregular appearance of intermediate tissue occurs in slight furrows between the
walls. In transverse sections of the skeleton also, angular spaces occur between the
walls of calyces more or less filled by caleareous deposits. The latter is laid down

around several centres of calcification without any definite position relative to calyci-
nal parts.

The edge-zone may at the same time be regarded as much curtailed. In correlation
with this fact we find that increase of the colony is said to take place by means of
“central” and “parietal” intracalycinal budding. As KiunziNGER says, central
intracalycinal budding is not distinguishable from the fission (“ Theilung”) in Favia.

A study of various skeletons shows that all these forms of increase are identical
with what has been called “septal budding” in fossil Palzozoic forms. In Gonius-
trea, “budding” is indicated in a calyx in two ways :—(1) Two pali in front of septa
extending from opposite walls grow more rapidly upwards than the rest of the pali
and are thickened so as to coalesce with the septa and form a diametric line of fission
across the calyx—this corresponds to “central” intracalycinal budding ; (2) Two pali
in front of septa extending from adjacent walls of the calyx form with their septa a
curving line of fission (sometimes the septa themselves coalesce without the aid of
pali)—this corresponds to “
