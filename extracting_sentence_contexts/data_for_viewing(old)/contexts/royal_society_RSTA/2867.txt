where the constant Cp is determined by the material and W(2) is the Willmore functional of Y.
The Willmore functional was first proposed as a model for bending elastic energy by
Poisson [19] in 1816 and again by Kirchhoff [20] in 1850. More recently, it has found applications
in cell biology. For example, W(Z) is the principle part of the Helfrich functional [21] in the
modelling of bilayer lipid membranes in cell mechanics. The first mathematical treatment of the
Willmore functional is due to Blaschke and Thomsen [22], who proved that the integral of the

squared mean curvature over a closed surface M is a conformal invariant. This means that it a
is invariant with respect to translations, rotations and dilatations of M. It is also invariant with : =
respect to the inversion x > |x|~?x provided that the pole of inversion does not belong to M. S
In particular, the Willmore energy equals 47 for every spherical surface. In fact, the Willmore 2
energy is the only conformal invariant up to a null Lagrangian. Blaschke and Thomsen also ty
derived the formula for the variation of the mean square curvature functional. These results a
were rediscovered by Willmore [23], who calculated the value of the Willmore energy for tori : S
and considered the variational problems related to this functional. We refer to the papers by : S

For hyperelastic materials, when the stretching energy €, corresponds to the first term in an
asymptotic expansion of three-dimensional elastic plate energy as a function of the (small)
