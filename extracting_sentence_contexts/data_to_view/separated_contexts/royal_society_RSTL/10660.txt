The retentiveness of the soft wire is reduced, and
that of the stretched wire greatly increased by the presence of stress during the
application and removal of magnetising force. $ 107. The Villari Critical Point.—Allusion has been made ($ 87) to the fact,
discovered by Villari, and afterwards by Thomson, that if we take a wire under the
influence of a longitudinal magnetising force, and alternately apply and remove a
given load, * on” gives augmentation and © off” gives diminution of magnetism if the
magnetisation is less than a certain value ; but © on” gives diminution, and * off ”

gives augmentation of magnetism if this value is exceeded. Sir WiLiam Tnowy
calls the value of the magnetising force ab which this reversal of effect occurs, F
« Yirrart critical value.” It is clear (as he has also pointed out) that the * Varma
critical value” depends on the particular amount of load alternately applied an
removed, and also upon the mean value of the load.
