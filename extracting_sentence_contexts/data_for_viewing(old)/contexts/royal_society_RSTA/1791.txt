generated in the vertical direction becomes quite low. The pickup coils, on the other hand, can
sensitively detect the change in the magnetic field only when the eddy current is disturbed.
Therefore, the probe has a high sensitivity to the variation of eddy current corresponding to the
waviness and shows the highest performance in both accuracy and precision.

On the other hand, even though CirD also has directional eddy current distribution, this probe
shows a larger RMSE than SymD and UniD. The difference in the error is due to the fact that eddy
current near the pickup coils is not perfectly directional and has non-uniform distribution even
in this narrow range. Therefore, the ECT signal cannot follow the change of electric resistance
faithfully with high spatial resolution, leading to larger errors in the contour map. SymD has
stronger directional eddy current than CirD. However, because the directional eddy current is
not uniformly distributed, the eddy current outside the region where the directional eddy current
is strongly distributed affects the signal and impairs the accuracy of SymD. A UniD probe using
uniform eddy current generates widely and uniformly distributed directional eddy current below
the pickup coils. This eddy current is highly robust to noise, whereas it is sensitively changed
according to the defect inside the uniformly distributed eddy current region. This characteristic
makes the accuracy of the UniD probe better for fibre waviness.

However, the lowest RMSE is 1.90° which UniD-v shows in yy = 90. This value is higher than
