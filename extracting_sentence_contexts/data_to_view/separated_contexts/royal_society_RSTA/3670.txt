Employing the balance laws for linear and angular momentum, the local forms of the equations 3 |
governing the dynamics of a constrained Cosserat medium are obtained [8,11]:
Opqp + Xq = hil (2.2)
and

CqpkOpk + Mpq,p + Yq = = Oe (2.3)
where opq and mpq denote the stress and couple-stress tensors (both asymmetric), and Xq and Yq
are, respectively, the body force and the body moment, both measured per unit volume. Decomposing the stress tensor opq into a symmetric ty, and antisymmetric a», part and using ts
equation (2.3), the antisymmetric part of the stress tensor can be written as

1 p . :
tpg = — 3 opqk(Mrkyr +Yx)+ Goa sOs- (2.4) a

A combination of equations (2.2)-(2.4) yields a single equation of motion for the symmetric part Dp
of the stress tensor and the deviatoric part of the couple-stress tensor: :s

The traction boundary conditions at any point on a smooth boundary consist of the following : gs

For linear constitutive behaviour, the strain energy density assumes the following general
quadratic form in the case of centrosymmetric materials:

1 1
W = 5Cpqmn€pgEmn + zBpgmnkpqkmn, (2.7)

where Epq is the standard infinitesimal strain tensor and Kpq = @qp is the curvature tensor (the
transpose of the gradient of rotation), which by definition is traceless, xp) =0. The elasticity
tensors Cpgmn and Bpgmn are equipped with the following symmetries: Cpgmn = Cmnpgq = Capnm,
Bpqmn = Bmnpq and Bgpmm = 0 (the last equality follows directly from the fact that the curvature
tensor is purely deviatoric [7]). Therefore, in addition to the 21 independent constants defining
the classical elasticity tensor Cpgnm, 36 independent constants are needed for defining Bygmn. The corresponding constitutive equations are

Tq = Dem Cpgmnémn and mpg = Tien = Bpqmnkmn- (2.8)

It is remarked that the Cauchy elastic behaviour is recovered when tensor Bygmn, defining a
‘purely Cosserat behaviour’, is set to zero.
