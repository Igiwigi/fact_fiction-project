The superphosphate of lime alone yielded more gross produce, but only a little more,
than was obtained without manure, and the excess was the less in the later years.
Indeed, not only the actual amount of produce, but the yield per acre of both nitrogen
and mineral matter declined more rapidly with the superphosphate alone than without
manure. In fact, the superphosphate of lime alone yielded, over the first 17 years of
its application, less than two-thirds as mnch produce as the mixed mineral manure, and
not three-fifths as much nitrogen. It is obvious, therefore, that the results which were

Sbtained on plot 7 were in only a very small degree due to the superphosphate which
She manure supplied. Let us see how the botany of the superphosphate plot bears out,
is conclusion. (See Table LXIX., pp. 1332-3.)
= Tt will be seen that the effect of the manure was, as already said, upon the whole,
xtremely meagre. In fact, there was scarcely any increased luxuriance induced ; and
Such increase in produce as there was, was mainly due to an increased tendency to
Stem-formation and consolidation of tissue in the case of some 8pecies. There was
dhus but little artificial struggle induced, and we have an average of 47 species as
-Zompared with 49 without manure. Both the percentage in the total herbage, and the
Zetual quantity per acre, of the total Graminez rather declined, whilst those of the
eguminosz rather increased ; and the percentage, but not the actual quantity, of the
-Mniscellaneous herbage also showed some tendency to increase.
S Compared with the produce without manure, there was, however, on the average,
1 slight increase of gramineous, a decrease of leguminous, and an increase of mis-
Sellaneous herbage, the result being but insignificant increase of total produce.
