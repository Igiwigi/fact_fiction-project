The electromagnetic force observed was the repulsion between two circular coils, of
which one was attached to the back of the suspended disk, and the other was placed

behind the large disk, being separated from it by a plate of glass and a layer of FLoOPER's

compound. A. current was made to pass through these coils in opposite directions, 80 as

If we take into account the fact that the section of each coil is of sensible area, this
formula would require correction ; but in these coils the depth was made equal to the
breadth of the section, whence it follows, by the differential equation of the potential of
two coils, given at p. 508 of my paper on the Electromagnetic Field,

that the correction is a factor of the form (1 —Yz A) where &' is the depth of the coil
—a correction which is in this case about 1—-000926. The s8uspended coil, besides the repulsion due to the fixed coil, experiences a couple
due to the action of terrestrial magnetigm. To balance this couple, a coil exactly similar
was attached to the other arm of the torsion-balance, and the current in the s8econd coil
was made to flow in the opposite direction to that in the first.
