Now it is not true that the hypoglossal nuclei are scarcely
onnected with each other other; for, as may be seen, especially in longitudinal and
orizontal sections along the fourth ventricle, at different depths of the nuclei, there is
yery evident, decussation of fine fibres; and at the upper end of the nucleus, the com-
Snissural fibres between the anterior groups of cells are particularly striking, as may be
S>zeen at J, fig. 57, Plate XIV. VULPLAN speaks almost in derision of SCHRODER VAN DER
FKoux's theory of the action of the olivary bundles; but, nevertheless, there are not
nting anatomical facts in favour of the opinion that these bodies are subservient to
ticulate speech. In this process, the tongue, the lips, the jaws and the expiratory

Zonnexion of the olivary bodies with the hypoglossal nuclei is yery striking.
