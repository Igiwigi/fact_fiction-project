(1916,* p. 464) remarks that the alisphenoid is partly a cartilage-bone and partly a
membrane-bone in Perameles, Trichosurus, Dasyurus, and Macropus; but the
construction of the alisphenoid bone in this manner is not by any means confined to
Marsupials, it may be demonstrated in the bisected skull of a new-born Pig, the
outline of the ossitied ala temporalis being clearly discernible to the naked eye against
the outer scale of membrane-bone with which it is co-ossified. In the Whales,
however, the applied membrane-bone seems to be entirely wanting,

The alisphenoid bone of Whales is a relatively small component of the cranial wall ;
it is but the ossitied ala temporalis, which has not spread upward and downward, and
consequently has nothing comparable with the great wing and the external pterygoid
plate familiar to students of human anatomy. ‘The erroneous interpretation of the
Whale’s pterygoid by Linum was probably due to the fact that Carrr, MACALISTER and
Dwiaeut, being medical men, confused the air-containing pterygoid fossa of the Whale
with the pterygoid fossa of Man, a space between the pterygoid bone on the inner side
