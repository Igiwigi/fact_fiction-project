disordered diamond and diaphite domains. These nanostructured elements are intimately
intergrown, giving rise to structural features erroneously associated with h diamond. Our
data suggest that the diffuse scattering in XRD and the hexagonal features in transmission
electron microscopy images reported from various natural and laboratory-prepared samples
that were previously used for lonsdaleite identification, in fact arise from cubic/hexagonal
stacking disordered diamond and diaphite domains.

of challenging materials (Part 2)’.

]. Introduction

Between 1967 and 1968, hexagonal (h) diamond was described from laboratory samples [1,2], 2S
from the Canyon Diablo and Goalpara meteorites [3] and as the newly named mineral lonsdaleite : 2
from the Canyon Diablo iron meteorite [4]. Bundy & Kasper [1] and Cowan et al. [2] reported the : >
