The
latter is solid and granular, the former is extremely transparent (compare HArcKEL,
loc. cit., figs. 6, 8, 10, 11, 12), and consists of two parts :—

(1.) Fine filaments running longitudinally; and suspended in

(2.) A more or less fluid plasm (Krieger, Joe. cit.). The junction between cell
substance and process substance is extremely abrupt. Similar tubular fibres enclosing

~ filaments are described by ScurerrerpecKER and Kossex in Petromyzon,* and the
S facts at present at our disposal warrant the suggestion that the filaments are the
5 structures which convey the nervous impulses.
— ‘The unit of the motor system of Astacus thus consists of the following parts :—
a, (1.) A single nerve cell which, from its histological characters, and relation to the
* blood stream, appears to be a highly metabolic structure ; and which is-removed by a
considerable length of nerve from the direct track of the nervous impulses.
©  (2.) A single nerve process from this cell which branches in a characteristic fashion,
5 and consists of a number of filaments, presumably processes of the cell, which are
2 suspended in a plasma.
@  (3.) The branches of this process, and, therefore, of the single nerve cell. These are
‘g very numerous, are distributed to the plexus of the ganglion and to a very large m mass
Sof muscle fibres.
8 If the prevailing conception of the trophic functions of the central nervous system
Z is correct, we must regard this single nerve cell as the trophic centre for this large
S mass of muscle fibres. Though at first sight the motor system of the flexor muscles, consisting, as it does,
#1 in each metamere of only a few fibres and cells, seems a simple one, yet a consideration
- of the arrangement of the flexors themselves shows that we must regard it as a simple
& contrivance arranged so as to secure a complex result.
