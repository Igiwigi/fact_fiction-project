of short duration. Fortunately all those which fulfil the other conditions fulfil this
also, and none have had to be rejected on this score. Secondly, the time and place
of origin must be tolerably accurately known. The limits of error adopted have
been 1 minute of time and 1° of are. In the case of all the earthquakes noticed
below, these limits are not exceeded, and in several cases the limit of error from this
cause is much less. Thirdly, I have excluded all cases where there were not a
sufficient number of independent records to serve as a check on, and confirmation of,
each other. Fourthly, as a separation of the condensational and distortional plane
waves is not to be looked for in the heterogeneous materials near the surface of the
earth, the records from places at distances of less than 20° of are from the origin
have not been taken into consideration.

In collecting the facts I have been almost exclusively indebted to the careful

and detailed accounts of earthquakes, both sensible and insensible, recorded in Italy,
which are regularly published through the enlightened liberality of the Italian
Government. Detailed descriptions of the records of most of the more important
seismographs established in Italy have been printed, at first in the Bollettino of the
Central Meteorological Office in Rome, and afterwards in that of the Italian Seismo-
logical Society. From these I have extracted the times of (1) the commencement of
the record, (2) of any marked sudden increase of movement, and (3) of any change
in its character, so far as these are mentioned; the results, in the case of the seven
