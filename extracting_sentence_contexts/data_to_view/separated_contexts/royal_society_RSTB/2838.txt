The structure of the pedicel is practically the same in both.t As already
pointed out the sporangium is attached to the crest in S. Dawsoni in quite the same
way as it is to the lamina in S, fertile; the complex structure of the sporangial wall
appears to be essentially the same in both. In fact the agreement in all these
features is as close as it could well be, considering that the sporangiophore is mono-
sporangiate in the one case and bisporangiate in the other. Several other species with monosporangiate pedicels have been described by
M. ZetnuEr ;ยง so far as the available data show they present no special points of
comparison with our fossil.
