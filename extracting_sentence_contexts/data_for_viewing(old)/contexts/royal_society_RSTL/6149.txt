parison must be made by means of the circle, viz. in the present case any conic passing
through the two Points of the Absolute is termed a circle, and the point of intersection of
the tangents to the circle at the two Points of the Absolute (or what is the 8ame thing, the

pole of the Absolute line in respect to the circle) is the centre of the circle. The Abso-

lute line itself may, if it is necessary to do 80, be considered as the axis of the circle. It

is assumed that the points of the circle are all of them equidistant from the centre, and
by this assumption we are enabled to compare distances upon different lines. In fact
we may, by a construction precisely similar to that of EucLip, Book I. Prop. I1., from a
given point A draw a finite line equal to a given finite line BC, and thence also upon
a given line through A, determine the finite line AD equal to the given finite line BC.
Since the unit of distance for points on a line is arbitrary, we cannot of course compare
the distances of points with the distances of lines. The distance of a point from a line
does, however, admit of comparison with the distance of two points ; we have only to
asume as a definition that the distance of a point from a line is the distance of the
point from the point of intersection of the line with the quadrantal line through the
S 221. As regards the analytical theory, suppose that the point-coordinates of the two
Spoints of the Absolute are ( p, 9,7), (Po: fo: 79), then the line-equation of the Absolute is
