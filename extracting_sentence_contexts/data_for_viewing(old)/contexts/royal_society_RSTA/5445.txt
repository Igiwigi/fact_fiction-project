Donaldson’s work originated in physics in the same way as the Hodge
theory of harmonic forms had been inspired by Maxwell’s equations, but this
connection appeared rather formal. More importantly, within Yang-Mills theory,
the equations become nonlinear. Instead of studying the solutions themselves,
Donaldson put in a central position the so-called moduli space that parametrizes

he family of solutions. In fact, one could regard the gauge-theoretic approach to
four-dimensional differential topology as replacing the points of the four-manifolc
by nonlinear instanton solutions of the Yang-Mills equations.

Moduli spaces are an essential ingredient of modern mathematics dating back

o the early nineteenth century. Those days were dominated by the theory o
elliptic functions. These are analytical functions of a simple complex variable

unique parameter of the theory. Again in the nineteenth century attention shiftec
o the multivariable generalization with a lattice of periods that provide many
moduli and lead to the famous theta-functions. In the twentieth century it was
realized that there is a nonlinear generalization of this theory, but the nonlinearity
