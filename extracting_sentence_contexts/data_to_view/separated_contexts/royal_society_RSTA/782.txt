Even though the XXZ model is certainly not
Lorentz invariant, this is similar to the property that, in Lorentz-invariant theories, energy flux =
divided by c? is equal to momentum density. With interactions, the problem of two reservoirs is : 3
much more complicated than in the free case. The fact that energy current is itself a charge in a
continuity equation allows one to derive several exact far-from-equilibrium results for integrals mea)
of the energy current distribution in space :

for the two-reservoir quench [45], which also explain some previously noted identities for : 5s
XXZ [46]. The more general hydrodynamical methods described in a moment can calculate the :
full spatial distribution but are limited to long-time, long-distance behaviour. We now return to the general properties of conserved charges in integrable and non-integrable
models to try to develop some general principles for time evolution on long length and time
scales.
