Beyond stage o the endodermal cells become closer together and deeper as they increase
in numbers (figures 110 to 112). A-surplus of cells piles up in the dorsal region of the middle
part of the body (figures 111 and 112). Here the already much vacuolated cytoplasm
disintegrates and the nuclei degenerate. All stages in the process have been found, some of
the nuclei nearest to the gut lumen in figure 111 are almost free from their disorganizing
cytoplasm and show stages of chromatin degeneration (d.n.). (For the evidence against the
supposed invagination of endoderm from the lips of the mouth-anus (blastopore of earlier
workers other than Kennel) see p. 518.)

FURTHER DEVELOPMENT IN PERIPATOPSIS CAPENSIS

Sedgwick assumed that the open blastopore (see p. 503) of P. capensis gave rise directly to
the large opening which divides to form the mouth and anus, but in fact he had no stages
between one with an open blastopore 204 in diameter and another of 448 x 480y with
a large mouth-anus (his figures 19 to 22 on plate 31, 1885, are not drawn to the same scale).
This gap has been reduced, but not entirely filled, by the present work, as no stage between
one with an almost closed blastopore 2104 in diameter and another of 257 x 286 with a
wide open mouth-anus has been found (figure 2g and h). The latter is younger than the
corresponding stage obtained by Sedgwick. Thus there is no direct evidence as to how the
mouth-anus arises. It is probable that it is formed by a reopening of the blastopore, and
if this is so, P. capensis differs from the three species with a dilated blastodermic vesicle here
described (p. 515).

The mouth-anus in the youngest stage obtained is 45 x 70 in size, with ectoderm and
endoderm continuous at the extreme edges of the lips which do not protrude (figures 113 and
