the role of the protoplasm and the role of the cell
wall. At the same time there is going on, not only a shrinking of the one, bub a
swelling of the other. Two principal objections may be very reasonably brought
forward to explain the fact, that the protoplagm adheres to the pit. Firs, ib may be
8aid, that the protoplasm is retained and even injected into the pit by the pressure of
the 8welling wall. That this objection will not hold is apparent from the fact that the
8ame phenomenon occurs in the case of cells which have been cub into.
