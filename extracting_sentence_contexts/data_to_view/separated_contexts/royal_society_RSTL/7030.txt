The powder was again washed with hot water, and the solution was
found to contain both sulphuric acid and lime. When the wash-water contained
only traces of sulphuric acid, the powder, greatly diminished in quantity, was again

observed under the microscope, and showed very few half-dissolved prisxms of gypsam,
but numerous very small octohedrons, which had been hidden by the gypsum. Besides
these octohedrons, some hemiprismatic crystals were found, precisely similar to those
which I formerly had obtained when forming a borate of magnesia. 'The powder con-
tained, further, some prisms which were striated parallel to the axis, and had a face per-
pendicular to this axis; they resembled precisely the crystals which I several years ago
described as artificial apatite, and which were obtained by fusing calcined bones with
chloride of sodium; and they were in fact apatite, formed of the phosphoric acid,
fluorine, chlorine, and lime of the sea-water. Of the powder in question, which essen-
tially consisted of octohedrons, I dissolved 7-184 grains in nitric acid, which left 0-160
grain of a reddish powder consisting mostly of oxide of iron, but showing also under
the microscope hemiprismatic crystals like the borate of magnesia. The nitric solution
gave with ammonia a precipitate which weighed 0-633, and contained phosphoric acid.
