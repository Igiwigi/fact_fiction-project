electric field E = (0,0, 0.384) Vnm_! in both cases. The anisotropy rise at the entrance of the CNT
in Case C, in contrast with the high anisotropy along the whole of the CNT in Case A, seems to
significantly affect the flow rate. Figure 8 shows that this localized application of an electric field
leads to a linear increase of the flow rate with field strength. At the highest field strength studied,
we measured flow rates of more than two-and-a-half times the zero-field flow rate, even though
the cross-membrane pressure difference remains the same.

We have already shown in figure 7 that the orienting effect on the water molecular dipole
of an electric field applied anywhere in the system will alter the anisotropy and biaxiality.
However, the density structuring and liquid phase of water under these conditions are not altered,
and so it would be impossible to uncover this change in the average orientation of the water
molecules by examining the density and hydrogen bonding measurements alone. In fact, for
