Given the extremely short
time scales over which gain in the solid state system exists owing to collisional effects, it is evident
that any improvements in understanding of the relevant rates could well influence the degree and
duration of gain predicted. It should be noted that the rates used in this study have been the those
used in previous versions of the SCFLY code, whereas recent experimental work has shown that
these rates may well be an underestimate [19,31]. Furthermore, here the assumption has also been
made that the distribution function of the electrons in the continuum is at all times Maxwellianâ€”
ie. we have both ignored the fact that the cold metal will have a Fermi-Dirac distribution of the
electrons, and we have further assumed that thermalization of the electrons is instantaneous. Both of the aforementioned assumptions warrant scrutiny. If, for the sake of argument, we do
assume instantaneous thermalization, the fact that the current version of the code does not take
into account the Fermi degeneracy of the initial electrons is unlikely to be significant because the
electron temperature exceeds the Fermi temperature on exceedingly short time scales.
