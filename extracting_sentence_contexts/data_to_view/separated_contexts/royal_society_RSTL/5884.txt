There
is a ï¬†mall orifice for a medullary artery at the middle of the back part of the tibia, but
it does not open into any medullary cavity: the bone is cancellous throughout. The fibula is thickest at its upper end, where it has a trihedral form ; the outer surface
is convex and rough, the inner and hinder surfaces are concave and smooth, meeting at
a sharp interosseous border directed obliquely backward: this border is slightly thickened
and produced at its middle part, where the shaft of the fibula, is compressed: it
augments in thickness and resumes its trihedral shape as it descends, and terminates
in a moderately produced outer malleolus (f) with a very rugged surface, except where ib
articulates with the astragalus. 1n the Mylodon, as well as in the Megalonyx and Scelidotherium, the tibia and fibula
continue separate, a fact affecting the value of the evidence which CUy1ER deduced from
their anchylosed condition in the Megatherium in fayour of its affinities to the Arma-
dillos. to which this structure is peculiar amongst existing Mammals. But, since it is
known only in the order Zruta, it forms an interesting additional proof of the essential
relations of the huge extinct animal under description to that now anomalous group of
Manumals.
