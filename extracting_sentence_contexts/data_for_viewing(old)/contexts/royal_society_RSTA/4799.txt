Bev â€” 5 Be, (3.15)
in the last step. The similarity to the EF term in the three-dimensional case becomes more apparent

by rewriting the latter as

FEE, = GO EM BERS aye PES = se EM ELR ys E, (3.16)

where

~ i
BO = Sel REN, (3.17)

In fact, this result can be expressed in the form of (3.14) for any dimension. In three dimensions it
turned out to have the most straightforward interpretation.

With the definition
Bi Bey = ByBk = 8)K (3.18)
for the metric, the BB term becomes
e e e
-| Biv Bh =- m7 ByBy =- v1 SI (3.19)

and is background-dependent as before.
Again integrating out the gauge field also entails a fluctuation determinant,

BS =gS/?, (3.20)
