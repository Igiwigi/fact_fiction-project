It appears from what has been said, that the due functions of respiration cannot be restored
till the due degree of neryous influence is supplied, and this cannot happen from inflation of the lungs till the
due force of circulation returns. Now the fact, explain it as we may, is, that voltaic electricity 80 perfectly
supplies the place of the neryous influence in the lungs, that their functions are equally perfect under the influ-
ence of either. The one can only be supplicd at an adyanced period of recovery, that is, in fact, only in those
cases where the success of our endeayours can be secured by other means; the other is, in all cases, within our
reach on the instant,

but greater in degree, its influence is throughout confined to that system*, In the
former case we ce all the vital functions deranged; in the latter, the breathing alone
affected, except as far as its state affects the others, death arising merely from respi-
ration ceasing in consequence of the loss of sensibility; and 80 exclusively is this
sometimes the case, that I had occasion to refer to an instance in which the patient
breathed only two or three times in the last ten minutes, but each time drew the air
freely into the lungs; a proof that he died without any accumulation of phlegm there,
and consequently without any disorder of the vital functions, but such as arose from
the increasing insensibility4.
