The change may represent but a small fraction of the current traversing the
Zelement of surface. The increment to the charge may also arise from a vertical
Zeurrent or a horizontal current, or partly from the one and partly from the other. As
Sa matter of fact, we know that usually a vertical air-earth current exists, as well as
Sso-called earth currents whose direction is mainly at least horizontal. Earth currents
"sare much in evidence during magnetic storms, but no certain relation between
potential gradient changes and magnetic storms seems yet to have been established. YThe normal diurnal inequality of potential gradient could be connected only with
Snormal air or earth currents, and information about either of these phenomena is
limited.
