Of course, it is natural to look
to atomic physics, as that field has so amply supplied metrology specialists
with atomic frequency, and two quantum relationships concerning electrical
quantities [2]. Collectively, one can thus arrive at a reliable reference for
time (for 40+ years the Cs hyperfine transition), and for electrical resistance
(von Klitzing’s effect) and electrical potential (Josephson’s effect). These two
latter quantum effects, in fact, are the basis for modern electrical standards,
with reproducibility approximately two orders better than their connection
with SI units, which is provided in the 3E-8 domain by the ‘watt balance’
experiments. So, in addition to the kg issue, the coming task of reworking the
SI still also requires to fully rationalize the situation between the electrical
units as maintained, and the existing SI. Also, as we will see, there are new
inputs from time to time which may be directly of interest and utility with
regard to reworking the SI.
