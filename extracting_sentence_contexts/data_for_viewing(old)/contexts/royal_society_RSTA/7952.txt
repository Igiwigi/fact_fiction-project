The remaining 12 materials which have proved brittle in liquid hydrogen had
possessed in liquid air a ductility of from 5 to 17%. There remain of these 29 ferrous
materials tested in both researches six, which even at the low temperature of — 252-8°
still retain a ductility of from 8 to 26%. Of these only two, namely, 12871 and 1449A,
have not suffered an appreciable reduction by this further drop in temperature ; these
are the plain high percentage nickel steels. 1287L, with 24-51% nickel, has at
— 252-8° an elongation of 8-0%, comparing with 10%, at — 182°; for 1449A, with
31-4% nickel, the corresponding figures are 11-0 and 10% respectively.

1287L remains, in fact, remarkably little affected over the whole range from ordinary
temperature down to — 262-8°, since at ordinary temperature its elongation was from
12 to 15%. 1449A, with the still higher nickel percentage, is, however, less tough at
these low temperatures than at ordinary temperatures, where its ductility was
29 to 30%.

Tt is further interesting to note that this group—that is, the six ferrous materials
which retain appreciable toughness in liquid hydrogen—includes the interesting alloys
containing 5 to 6% of manganese with a comparatively high content of about 14 to
24%, of nickel.

Because of their remarkable behaviour in liquid air there was reason to look for
interesting results from them in the present tests. Although they still retain con-
