Compact Lie groups, on the other hand, are the simplest
examples of Riemannian manifolds and we can similarly, albeit more loosely, think of the ‘dual’
of the latter as coming down to quantum mechanics or wave operators of different types. Recall
that quantum mechanics in nice cases can be seen as the non-relativistic limit of the Klein—
Gordon space-time Laplacian for fields where e~mt/h is factored out. In fact a Riemannian or
pseudo-Riemannian manifold cannot be totally reconstructed from the scalar Laplacian alone,
but if we use the Dirac operator, then one has Connes’ reconstruction of a spin manifold from
an abstractly defined ‘spectral triple’ in the commutative case [17]. Either way, if one extends
these ideas from classical to quantum field theory, then logically an aspect of this should be
that it corresponds to quantum Riemannian geometry, where space-time coordinates become non-
commutative. This should then be taking us towards the self-dual axis as shown in figure 1.
