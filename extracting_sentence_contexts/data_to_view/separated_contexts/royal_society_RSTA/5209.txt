Such an increase in the specific
heat of steam with rise of temperature would explain the divergence between the
observed and calculated rates of explosion of hydrogen with oxygen, and with nitrous
oxide. And conversely, it appears to me that the results of the French experi-
menters would be equally well explained by the temporary dissociation of steam in
their explosions. One fact appears, at first sight, to be opposed to the hypothesis of incomplete
combustion. The addition of oxygen, one of the products of the dissociation of
steam, retards the explosion of electrolytic gas more than the addition of an equal
volume of nitrogen—an inert gas. Wunrrz found, in the case of phosphoric chloride,
that the amount of dissociation was greater when the chloride was volatilised in air
—an inert gas, than when it was volatilised in the presence of the lower chloride—
one of the products of its decomposition.
