S Tuomsen added large quantities of water and so obtained a total heat

& By the method here described the thermal capacity is kept sufficiently low to

eT emperatures can thus be well equalised before dilution takes place.

2b The following record describes work extending from October, 1912, to December,

a 1914. The accurate determination of heat of dilution is necessarily a tedious business,

3 owing to the fact that only one observation can be taken in an ordinary working day
of six hours.

> Measurement of Temperature.

= In most of the previous researches on heat of dilution a mercury thermometer was
E employed. Here temperature changes were measured with certainty by a platinum
aa ~y thermometer with fundamental interval of 12°8 ohms—mounted in a very thin-
8 walled cylindrical bulb, whose length is not far short of the depth of the solution.
vane experience with the working of this thermometer in other researches and
% careful application of all the corrections peculiar to it, enable the author to guarantee
A its readings. (Diagram I., T.)

Importance of Stirring. One of the most important features of the experiment is the stirrer, Different
types were tested, and the most efficient one was found to be of the screw propeller
type turned by a high speed motor.
