Again, then, as far as 6° there is a doubly-infinite series of figures of equilibrium, not
two singly-infinite series.

In this earlier and simpler investigation, it was an easy matter to carry the
computations to the third, fourth, and fifth orders of small quantities. It was found
that the equations giving é, for a figure of equilibrium could not be satisfied so long
as 3, was kept indeterminate, they could only be satisfied for one special value of 3,,
namely j, = — ~. After having determined the value of 6, in this way, it was
possible to investigate the stability, and the pear-shaped cylinder was found in point
of fact to be stable. What is important in connection with the present paper is that
it was not possible to determine the stability of the pear until after its figure had been
determined to the third order of small quantities.*

38, The work of Porycaré can hardly be compared in detail with the investiga-
tion of the present paper, because Porncar# tacitly assumes the whole point at
issue ; namely, that it is possible to determine the beginning of the pear-shaped series
from an investigation of figures of equilibrium going only as far as second-order
terms. The work of Darwin admits of detailed comparison, because DARw1IN’s
work claims actually to have effected the determination which I am compelled to
believe, after my investigation, to be impossible.

Tt will be clear that any extra condition in addition to the conditions that the
