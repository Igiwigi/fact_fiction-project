by the number of days in the month, allow for non-cyclie change, find the algebraic
excess of each hourly mean value over the corresponding mean for the 24 hours, and
convert the inequality thus formed into C.G.S. units, through multiplication by the
factor representing the equivalent in force of 1 mm.

When a temperature correction is required, the inequality of temperature for each
month can be derived from the hourly measurements of the temperature curves.
This is converted into force from a knowledge of the temperature coefficient, and the
result is applied with appropriate sign as a correction to the inequality already
obtained. There would be a great increase of labour, and no gain in accuracy, so
far as the inequality is concerned, if each hourly value of the magnetic curve were
corrected for temperature. A second and conclusive reason for not correcting
individual hourly values was the fact that continuous records of temperature were
not taken in the magnetograph room until 1895. This being so, a course was
followed which at least reduced labour to a minimum. During the 11 years no
change had been made in the magnetograph room, or in the programme of work done
in it or adjacent parts of the building. There was thus no reason to suspect any
considerable change in the thermal phenomena in the room, and evidence pointing to
the same conclusion was derivable from the 8 or 4 daily readings from mercury
thermometers under the glass shades covering the H and V magnets. It was thus
decided to calculate mean diurnal inequalities of temperature, utilising the
