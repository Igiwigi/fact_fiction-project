On the whole, it seems wiser to be content with merely recording the presence of
this form, leaving questions as to its name and position until its characters have been
more fully worked out.

Schizomycete No. 3.
Bacterium aceti (Kisrz.). (Plate 15, figs. 7-9.)

In all the specimens of Ginger-beer plants sent to me, I found varying quantities
of a small bacterium (about 1 to 1°5 yw long, and 0°3 to 0°5 « broad) which turned out
to be the well-known bacterium of acetic acid fermentations. The acid smell and
reaction referred to on p. 127 are principally due to this intruder.

Two facts made it necessary to undertake the further investigation of this
Schizomycete, however ; to say nothing of the recent discovery that there are at least
two physiological forms (races or species) of the organism, viz., the ordinary Bacterium
aceti (Kisrz.), and Hansen’s B. pasteurianum, which only differs in that it turns blue
‘in iodine owing to the presence of a starch-like substance in the matrix surrounding
its protoplasm.*

These facts are, first, that the bacterium of the acetic ferment forms a well developed
and even massive zooglesa-like skin in which yeast-cells and all kinds of organisms may
