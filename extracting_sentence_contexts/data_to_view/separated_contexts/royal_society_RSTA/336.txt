While
the components are assumed to be independent in the model, the model does not have enough
parameters to actually make the components independent for any given random vector x. This is
because statistical independence is a very strong property with potentially an infinite number of
degrees of freedom. In fact, independence of two random variables s; and sp is equivalent to any
nonlinear transformations being uncorrelated, i.e.

cov(fi (s1),f2(s2)) = Effi (s1)f (s2)} â€” Effi (si) }E{f(s2)} = 0, (6.1)

for any nonlinear functions f, and fy, with E{.} denoting mathematical expectation. This is
in stark contrast to uncorrelatedness, which means that (6.1) holds for the identity function
fils) =f2(s) =s. This equation suggests that to find a transformation that is guaranteed to give
independent components, we need an infinite number of parameters, i.e. a class of rather
arbitrary nonlinear transformations.
