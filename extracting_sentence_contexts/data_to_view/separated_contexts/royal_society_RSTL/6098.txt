THEORY OF DIATOMIC BASES.â€”DIPHOSPHONIUM-COMPOUNDS. Is surveying. the rich harvest of discoveries which of late years have rewarded the
exertions of chemists, with reference to their general effect on the progress of the science,
we cannot avoid recognizing as one of the most valuable amongst their acquisitions, the
development of the theory of polyatomic compounds. Seldom has a theory diffused a
clearer light on previously established facts, or exerted a more fructifying and inspiring
influence on the labours of chemists. First coming into notice in the classical
researches of GRAHAM and LigBIG on the polybasic acids, and afterwards extended and
generalized by the experiments of Germarpy and WILLIAMSON, it has acquired in
BerTHELOT'S beautiful investigation of Glycerin, a new field of discovery, the active
cultivation of which has already brought to maturity a great variety of fruits. An im-
