Moreoyer, the converse of this experiment, the increased conducting power by the
application of cold to the wire, is equally demonstrable : thus, a wire under the ordi-
nary atmospheric conditions has its conducting power greatly increased by evaporating
ether from its 8urface *,

53. Although the disposition of electricity on insulated conductors is subject to the
laws above deduced (16.), and which are invariable when the surface remains the
same, or is perfectly similar in respect of dimensions and form, yet these laws do not
appear, under eyery condition, incidental to the conducting surface. It has been
already observed by Vorra, that extension in length greatly contributes to increase
the capacity of a conductor ; 80 that of two plane surfaces of equal area, that which
has the greatest extension has also the greatest capacity for electricity. I have pur-
sued this interesting fact, and have arrived at some further results which seem of
importance.

(o.) Having procured some rectangular plates of equal area, such as represented in
fig. 19, whose figures varied from a circle, through a square, up to a long parallelo-
gram, I submitted them to experiment, according to the methods already described
(14.). Each plate was placed in connexion with the electrometer a, fig. 2, and a given
quantity of electricity transferred on it, from a jar charged to a known extent, by
means of a small insulated transfer plate. After a few trials it became evident that
the intensity varied in an inverse ratio of the perimeter of the respective plates, the
differences being inconsiderable between the circle and square, but more decided as
the area became extended in length. Thus, in the parallelograms Â«, d, e, fig. 19, the
intensities, as corresponding with the dimensions, were as in the following Table :
