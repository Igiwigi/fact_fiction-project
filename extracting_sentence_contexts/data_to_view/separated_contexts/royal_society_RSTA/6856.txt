The next two sections
describe and illustrate methods of obtaining and using the necessary finite-difference
equations for boundary conditions of the type (I.4) or (I.5), when the boundaries are
rectangular. There is at present no completely satisfactory method of dealing with curved
boundaries; some possibilities are discussed in ยง 4.

2. Rectangular boundaries

The importance of rectangular boundaries lies in the fact that the normal to the boundary
is always in the direction of one of the mesh lines. In this case only is it possible to establish
without difficulty finite-difference formulae, for points on or adjacent to the boundary,
which will satisfy both the differential equation (of type I.2) and the boundary condition
(of type I. 4 or I.5). Ficure 1

Consider, for example, the mesh of figure 1, in which the boundary is a line of nodal points.
