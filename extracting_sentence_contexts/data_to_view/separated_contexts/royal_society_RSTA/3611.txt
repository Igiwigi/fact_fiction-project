It was also envisaged that organics were present. Colloquially, the 4
overall idea became known as the ‘dirty snowball’ of cometary nuclei. In a sense the close-up 72
images of Halley obtained by Giotto [4] confirmed the ‘icy conglomerate’ model but there was a : a
fundamental surprise—the surface was very dark, with an albedo of less than 4% (in fact, history : &

records that this had been predicted just prior to the encounter with Halley; see [5]). The spacecraft
found hardly any evidence for bright patches of ice at the surface of Halley. This seemed to suggest
that water (ice) was perhaps not as prevalent in comets as once thought.
