back of the soft and perfectly white embryo was gradually pressing through the
opening. The young being was now entering a new state. Its body had exhausted
the nourishment supplied to it by the yelk, and it had thus arrived at the termina-
tion of the first period of its development, a period of twenty-five days.

In the second period of development the embryo is exposed to a new medium, and
perbaps derives the means of its further growth from external sources, although it is
still enveloped in the foetal membranes, and retains its connexion with the shell.

The apodal condition of the young Lulus at the bursting of its shell, has already
been noticed by Savi and Waca, the latter of whom refers also to its extremely deli-
cate and motionless state ; but both of these naturalists have overlooked the remark-
able fact of its remaining for many days connected to the shell by means of a distinct
funis(d), and also of its being till inclosed in the amnion, the proper foetal covering.

The liberation of the embryo by the bursting of its sbell is a remarkably slow pro-
cess, as compared with the escape of other animals from the egg. In my observa-
tions from ten to twelve hours elapsed before the body of the embryo was s0 far libe-
rated as to remain only partially inclosed between the two halves of the shell (fig. 5.),
to the interior of which it was still attached by its pedicle or funis (4). So remarkable
is its condition at this period, that it strongly resembles the expansion of the germ
in the seed of a plant, rather than the evolution of a living animal. The embryo is
perfectly motionless, and the bursting of its shell appears to be effected, not by any
direct effort of its own, since, up to this period, it has acquired only the form and
