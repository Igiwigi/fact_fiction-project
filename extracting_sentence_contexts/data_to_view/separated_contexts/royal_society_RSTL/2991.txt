Sir GrorGe CockBurx and Mr. Barrow from the Admiralty, and several
other naval men whose opinions on such subjects are entitled to the utmost
deference, not only attended at the Trinity House, but went afterwards to
Blackwall to observe the relative appearance of the lights when exhibited at
a distance. The night of the 31st May had been appointed by the Deputy
Master for this purpose ; and, being desirons that the subject should be fully
scrutinized, I was glad to learn on returning from Purfleet that, besides the
gentlemen immediately connected with the Trinity House, the experiments
described in Captain Harr's letter had been witnessed by Admiral Sir Taomas
Hazvy ; by the Lorp ApvocartE of Scotland, one of the Commissioners for the
northern light-houses ; by Sir 'Tromas BrIsBanE, Colonel Corpy, Captain Beau-
ForT, Hydrographer to the Admiralty, and seyeral other individuals eminent,
for their professional and scientific attainments ; and as far as I have been able
to learn, the opinions of these distinguished persons coincide with those ex-
pressed by Captain Hair, who in fact, as he has given me authority to state,
endeayoured to frame his account of what passed in strict conformity with
the general sentiments of the party, and neither to exaggerate nor under-rate
any of the results. It now only remains for me to perform the agreeable task of bearing testimony
to the liberal spirit evinced by the Trinity Corporation on this occasion, and to
the desire which they have manifested of facilitating, by every means in their
power, the introduction of this method of illumination into light-houses. Indeed
I hesitate not to express my belief that, if this do not take place, it will arise
