the last section are summarized in table 13. The table shows average values of certain ratios
for the various sequences. In general, geometric means have been taken over all values of
d for which values of the ratio in question were available. Exceptions are as follows. In all
cases R,,/R, is calculated for the same values of das R,/S,. In the altitude data v[H,]/o[ H;]
and v[Hj]/v[ Hj] are taken from table 7, and }(£,,+ £,,)/S, and E,,/S, from table 8; other
ratios involving 5, cover the values of d = 2 to 6, 8 to 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, values of R, and
D,, being obtained by interpolation where necessary.

The ratios of the table must not be regarded as estimates of parameters which have
definite fixed values for the type of sequence in question. In part the actual values of the
ratio will depend on the range and values of d included in their calculation, in part on the
properties of the particular sequence chosen for analysis. Thus, for example, the low value
of o[H,]/vL Hj] for air temperature is due to the fact that the period covered was deliberately
chosen to illustrate the case in which end-corrections would be of little or no value, whereas
in the case of the soil temperatures the period was deliberately chosen so as to give maximum
chance of improvement with end-corrections.

Nevertheless, in spite of these qualifications, a number of general conclusions emerge from
the table, which may be summarized as follows.

(a) End-corrections, v|H,|/v[H,;]. The importance of end-corrections is apparent. In cases
in which there is a marked trend, and a fairly continuous type of variation, failure to apply
them may, when / is a multiple of d, result in systematic samples being less accurate than
random samples with one point per block (4in. soil temperature), or even than random
samples with two points per block (12in. soil temperature).
