bring the lead (p) from the thermopile into connexion with the lead ( p’) conducting
to the galvanometer (g), or to connect the lead (A) from the nickel-iron thermocouple
of the quartz vessel with the lead ( p’) conducting to the galvanometer. From E the
wire passes to the reversing key, which is enclosed in an asbestos box, and from here
to the galvanometer (g).

The spot of light from an electric incandescent lamp, after passing through a
lens, was reflected from the galvanometer mirror upon a transparent celluloid scale.

Great difficulty was experienced in steadying the galvanometer ; the suspension of
the galvanometer in a box on an india-rubber band, and the placing of the box on a
very heavy stone, which again was placed in its turn on thick pieces of india-rubber,
gave vibrations of 1 to 2 millims., owing to the fact that the dark room the author
had to use was near machinery at work. It was ultimately steadied in the following
manner :—A soft thick copper wire was drawn from one wall of the room to the
other, and the wire was first stretched and shortened until it stood the weight of the
box containing the galvanometer suspended on two very thick and flexible rubber
rings. Inside the box the galvanometer (with the wooden plate on which it was
standing on pieces of copper) was suspended from one rubber ring on the hook’
of a screw, which was passed through a hollow wooden cylinder on the top of
the wooden box and held by a nut, placed on a metal plate on the top of the
wooden cylinder. By raising the screw outside and turning the nut the galvano-
meter could be brought to any height desired, and by carefully turning the screw
it could be placed at any angle, so as to get the spot of light at any required
place on the scale. The screws of the galvanometer were resting upon metal pieces
