He disputed Tait’s assertion, that matter and energy were objectively real because they were
conserved, on philosophical grounds and pointed out that our knowledge of the conservation
of both was limited by the accuracy of experiment. Claims of absolute conservation rested on an
unjustified extrapolation from macroscopic experience. Similarly, theories of matter based on the
ether rested on a mathematical fiction, a continuous perfect fluid, extrapolated from macroscopic
imperfect fluids. Matter and energy, he concluded, were ‘complex mental images’, of phenomena
that might possibly result purely from the curvature of space—an idea that did not gain currency

at the time but foreshadowed Einstein’s general relativity [38, quote on p. 287]. : =

Possibly the North British physicists felt able to ignore Clifford’s suggestion of curved space : =

rotated in space without changing their form, he restricted physicists’ (but not mathematicians’) ZR
consideration to geometries of constant curvature.
