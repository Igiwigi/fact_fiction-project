The gain in weight of the calcium chloride tubes corresponds to a loss of water
amounting to 5-51 per cent., which agrees very closely with the theoretical for the
following equation (5-49 per cent.) : CyyHag0, > C1zH260; + H,O. It would appear,
therefore, that hydrolysed dehydrated “ A” is a substance having the same empirical
formula as Substance “ A,” but containing three carboxyl groups and on heating above
100° C, it reverts by loss of 1 mol. of water to dehydrated “ A.”

The presence of solvent of crystallisation, as indicated by the difference between the
total loss in weight on heating (0-0379 gm.) and the gain in weight of the CaCl, tubes
(0-0264 gm.), together with the extreme instability of hydrolysed dehydrated “ A 4

even at room temperature, have rendered it impossible to obtain satisfactory combustion
results. The instability of the material is indicated by the fact that, while a freshly
prepared sample has a melting point of 87° C., this had fallen to 82° C. after standing
for three days at room temperature and to 42°-43° C. after standing for three weeks at
the same temperature. ALKYLATION Propucts. It was hoped by studying the alkylation products of Substance “ A” and hydrolysed
Substance “ A” to obtain confirmation of the observation already made (see p. 313)
that hydrolysed “A” contains one hydroxyl group.
