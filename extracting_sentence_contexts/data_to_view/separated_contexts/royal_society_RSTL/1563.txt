This substance produces the phenomena which Mr.
CHENEVI1X, in his able paper on oxymuriatic acid, referred to
the hyperoxygenised muriatic acid; and they prove the truth
of his ideas respecting the possible existence of a compound
of ox ymuriatic gas, and oxygene in a separate state. The explosions produced in attempts to procure the pro-
ducts of hyperoxymuriate of potash by acids are evidently
owing to the decomposition of this new and extraordinary
substance. All the conclusions which I have ventured to make re-
specting the undecompounded nature of oxymuriatic gas,
are, I conceive, entirely confirmed by these new facts. If oxymuriatic gas contained oxygene, it is not easy to
conceive, why oxygene should be afforded by this new
compouni to muriatic gas, which must already contain OXy-
gene in intimate union. Though on the idea of muriatic acid
being a compound of hydrogene and oxymuriatic gas, the
phenomena are such as might be expected.
