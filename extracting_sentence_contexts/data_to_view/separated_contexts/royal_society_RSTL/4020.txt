I then place the
prepared frog astride between the balls of the uniyersal discharger, and establishing
a communication between the coating of the jar and these two balls, very strong con-
tractions of the frog follow. Continuing this operation in precisely the same manner,
and producing successive discharges of the same bottle through the frog, I never
obtain less than twelve contractions, and in some cases I have even had as many as
twenty. The first fact which strikes our attention in these experiments is that which
Vorra himself did not fail to observe. The most feeble discharge, said Voura, directed
from the nerve to the muscle, and which provokes contraction, is but the one-fourth
or even the one-sixth of that which is necessary to produce contraction when directed
from the muscle to the nerve. This difference we are enabled to measure more
exactly by acting with the electric current.
