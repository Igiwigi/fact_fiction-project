The conception of the inclusion in the protoplasm of soma or gonad of substances
exerting a formative influence on growth is, of course, an old one. CUNNINGHAM’S
“hormone” theory of the origin and inheritance of certain adaptive characters
approaches in some respects the hypothesis suggested above for the explanation
of parallel induction, with the great exception that the former theory demands that
the production of these “ hormones ” for an “indefinite number of generations ” can
finally result in such a fixed character as the erect position in man or the tendency to
horn production in the sexually mature stag. This, of course, is going far beyond
known facts, and seems to require the assumption that the “hormone” can act for an
indefinitely long time after it has ceased to be actively produced. To account for his results with Daphnia, Wourrreck has proposed a complicated
biochemical scheme of interaction between gene and environment. I can only say
that it does not seem to me to account for the persistence of the induced effects in
F, (observed apparently only in one exceptional case by Wonrereck) and that it
accounts not at all for the reaction observed in my experiments in F,.
