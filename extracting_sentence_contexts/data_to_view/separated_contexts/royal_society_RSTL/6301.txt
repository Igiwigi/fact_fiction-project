There can scarcely be a doubt that the amount,
-Sof heat radiated from a given area of the lower surface of the flame is diminished by,
Zrarotaction, owing to the decreasing luminosity of the flame : nevertheless this diminution
EY compensated by the increased flame surface, the radiant heat from which strikes the
Scapsule when the flame becomes enlarged by rarefaction. Whether this compensation
Sbe complete or not is of little importance, since observation shows that, even at the
Thighest degrees of rarefaction, a sufficient amount of heat reaches the capsule to keep
Eup an abundant supply of liquefied combustible matter. Z We have therefore no ground for any &@ priori assumption that the combustion of
Scandles ought to go on at a decreased rate in rarefied air; in fact there is one considera-
Stion which might lead to the opposite opinion ; it is this, —the rapidity of the consmmp-
Stion of a candle obyiously depends upon the amount of liquefied wax, &c. which passes up
its wick in a given time : this amount is determined, up to a certain maximum limit, by
=the rapidity with which it is got rid of at the upper portion of the capillary tubes where it
Sis volatilized by the heat of the flame. Now, as the rapidity of volatilization is known to
Rbe increased by a reduction of pressure, it follows that a larger amount of the combustible
would be thus removed from the upper portion of the wick in rarefied than in com-
pressed air. Nevertheless this influence of reduced pressure must be yery small in the
case of bodies poxsessing 8uch high boiling-points as tallow, wax, &c., and hence its
influence upon the rate of combustion in rarefied air cannot be perceived.
