PROF. A. FOWLER ON SERIES LINES IN SPARK SPECTRA. 249

The first striking result derived from these calculations is that the separation of the
second member is 80°5, which is exactly that of the d and s doublets of the “ F.P.”
system. Hence it is suggested that the variable parts mP,, mP, are really identical
with corresponding terms of the p series (Table VIII.). The differences are in fact
not too great to be attributed to defects of the simple formule employed. Thus the
P and p series may also be considered as running parallel to each other at a distance
apart of Po —po = 121,269°7—51,464°2 = 69,805°5 = 8(2)—S(1). Since the data
for the p series depend upon more complete observational material than those for P,
the latter may be corrected by the former, with the following results :—
