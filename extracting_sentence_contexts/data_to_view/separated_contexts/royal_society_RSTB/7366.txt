Nevertheless, the histone from the thymus gland of the calf,
which is the only member of this group of basic proteins which has hitherto been sub-
mitted to any extensive chemical investigation, has always been prepared by other
methods (Lilienfeld 1894; Felix & Rauch 1931) from the whole gland. The basic proteins
used in the present investigation have, with the exception of that from wheat germ, been
extracted from isolated cell nuclei. This procedure not only ensures that they do, in fact,
originate from the nucleus, but it also constitutes an important step in their purification. Histones

For the extraction of histones, 2g. of dry cell nuclei are weighed into each 50 ml.
centrifuge tube used. Since dry nuclei do not easily wet with aqueous solvents, they are
stirred with a small amount of absolute alcohol until thoroughly wet with this solvent.
