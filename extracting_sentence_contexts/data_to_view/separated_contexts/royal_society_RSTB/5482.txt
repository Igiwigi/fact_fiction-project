This question has been discussed by various morphologists both on general com-
parative grounds and in special connection with Early Devonian plants. It will not
be entered into fully here. The present state of our knowledge regarding the small
leaves of existing Vascular Cryptogams and of Thursophyton and Asteroxylon may,
however, be referred to in order to indicate how the facts for Psilophyton, by adding to
the rather limited sources of evidence, bear on the general problem,

The small, simple appendages of Lycopodium, to take this plant as an illustration of the

Lycopodiales for the present purpose, show the morphological and biological characters
of leaves both in their construction and in their relation to the stem. The small leaf
is here flattened and dorsiventral, provided with stomata and traversed by a single
vascular strand, that is in continuity with the stele of the stem.
