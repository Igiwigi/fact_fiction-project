However, nonlinear responses : 3
to greenhouse gas forcing are known to exist, and are expected to be important in specific regions [3
such as the North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre. Furthermore, competition between multiple forcings :8
(e.g. greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosol) complicate the relationship between changes : s
in GMST and changes in local climate. An important consequence is that large forced changes in 1&

regional climates may occur in the absence of any (net) forced change in GMST, a fact which is
crucial to the assessment of geo-engineering proposals. In reality, the signal of forced climate change on local scales is progressively emerging from
the background of natural variability. Measuring rates of change relative to this background
variability (rather than solely in absolute terms) is important for the assessment impacts
and changing risks.
