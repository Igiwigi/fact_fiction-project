& 19 were parts of matured leaflets. Plate LIL. fig. 16 represents one of several
specimens which seemed to sustain this idea. It looks like a section of a revolute leaf-
let resembling fig. 15, yet it undoubtedly belongs to the leaflet series of figs. 13 & 14;
as is the case with all the leaflets of the latter specimens, its obtuse margins indicate
a more succulent state than do the sharply defined incuryed edges of Plate LII. fig. 15.
If fig. 16 is really a transverse s8ection of one leaflet, and not a combination of 7w0'
leaflets intersected longitudinally, the identity of the two forms would be almost cer-
tain ; but I have not been able to link the two forms in a perfectly satisfactory manner.
There is also the further difficulty, that the objects represented in figs. 15, 17, 18, & 19
are leaflets of a Pecopteris of the type of P. Serlii, none of the pinnules of fronds of
which type are constructed on the plan of figs. 13 & 14. I am therefore now inclined
to conclude that Rachiopteris aspera (as T propose provisionally to designate the petioles
just described) is a Sphenopteris. It is an important fact in reference to this question,
that we haye in the Coal-measures a Sphenopteris with a tuberculated rachis, and which
has a wide geographical range. This. is the S. Zoeninghaus! already referred to. The


pinnules of this plant exhibit aspects which resemble those of figs. 13 & 14 in the
closest manner, rendering the conclusion that our Oldham fossil is generically, if not
specifically, identical with the above plant, an exceedingly probable one.

The acceptance of this conclusion demonstrates two facts connected with the Carbo-
niferous ferns :â€”first, that their vascular bundles are not necessarily, like those of
living ferns, surrounded by a definite investing cylinder of prosenchyma; and, secondly,
that the prosenchymatous fibres of their snbepidermal tissues (the sclerenchyma of
