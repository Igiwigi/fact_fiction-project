Bucurerew (12) places the central continuation of the vagus and trigeminal
nerves amongst the so-called “scattered fillet fibres,” which lie internal to the chief
fillet. According to him, their termination is in the parietal region of the cortex
cerebri. Epivcer (31), on the other hand, working with the myelination method,
places the central tract of the trigeminal nerve in the dorsal part of the tegment,
lateral and rather ventral to the posterior longitudinal bundles. The existence ot
this tract, which has been also found in rabbits by WALLENBERG (30) to degenerate
after section of the fibres as they leave the trigeminal end-nucleus, is indicated
in man by the presence of numerous fibres in a similar position, although there is no
evidence that they belong to the trigeminal system. In rabbits, this system ends in
the ventral nucleus of the optic thalamus.

For the investigation of this subject the sensory path was divided as high up in
the hind brain as was possible and compatible with survival, the operation being
naturally a severe one.

The experiments were—
1. Hemisection of the tegmentum pontis immediately behind the posterior
quadrigeminal body (Exps. 22, 28).
