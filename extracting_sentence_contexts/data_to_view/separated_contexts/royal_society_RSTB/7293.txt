If this treelessness is a reality, it might be attributed to
altitude, thin soil, or exposure, but it is equally possible that the absence of evidence for
tree growth is a fortuitous effect of conditions of incorporation at the site. If we agree that the Allerod oscillation is indeed represented, we are thrown back upon
the problem of the nature of the vegetation at the commencement of the post-Glacial
period, a matter already considered somewhat in § 5¢. Since in zone IV pollen of warmth-
demanding trees is already present in appreciable amount, it might be thought that these
trees were in fact growing either in Cornwall or not far away at this time, although ap-
parently they were not in zone II. The majority of Allerod sites have been described from
basins formed as kettle-holes in the terminal moraines of the last glaciation, and we must
expect that at sites well outside the glaciation limits both stratigraphic and vegetational
phenomena will differ appreciably. The true picture can only emerge when more sites
have been examined in a peripheral region outside that where the Allerod occurs typically
developed.
