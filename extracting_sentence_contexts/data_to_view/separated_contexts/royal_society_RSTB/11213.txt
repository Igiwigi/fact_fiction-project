I stand to be corrected. I revise my conception
when faced with someone who knows better. I may also
defer about other facts about elms, beyond those used to
pick them out or distinguish them, e.g. what to do with
elm wood, how to cut it or use it. These are further plausibly
distinctive grounding characteristics. Linguistic labels combined with deference are good
distinctive characteristics for grounding abstract concepts.
