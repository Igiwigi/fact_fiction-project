C. LLOYD ON THE CHOICE OF HOSTS AND

hosts throughout the first 2 or 3 weeks of their lives, and have had no actual experience
of an unparasitized host. Another striking feature which will be observed in the table and graph is the fact
that although the number of eggs laid per day after the fifth day of the parasite’s life
is considerably less than ten when twenty-five unparasitized hosts are supplied daily
to the female, this average is still further reduced when only ten unparasitized hosts
are available daily. The importance of this frequency of contact with hosts as a stimulus
for oviposition is apparent, too, when the female is given parasitized hosts, for there is
an appreciable difference between the average number of eggs laid by the females
supplied with twenty-five or ten parasitized hosts.
