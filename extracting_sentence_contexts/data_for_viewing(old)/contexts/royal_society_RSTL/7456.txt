"Part of the large flexor muscle ; it is the principal adductor of the limb.
Z Of the museles of the lower leg, those on the anterior side are readily distinguished as
wlibialis anticus, extensor digitorum (communis longus), and peroneus longus ; the ex-
Rtensor terminates in two slender tendons only, inserted into the metatarsal bones of the
econd and third toes

* In a male Grammatophord it is situated above the penis and its muscle.

+ Dr. Havenrzox (7. c.) describes and figures this muscle in the Crocodile as 1. extensor femoris caudealis, and
expresses its use in the following words ;—** The Crocodile, resting on mud, progresses chiefly by using his hind
feet as paddles; and in this use of them the great caudal extensor of the thigh is the most powerful and im-
portant muscle employed.” The fact that this musele is developed in ground- and tree-lizards as well as in the
Crocodile, prevents us from adopting the idea of its being an organ specially adapted for the mode of life of the
latter. When in the progres of ordinary locomotion one of the hind limbs is advanced, and its 8ole becomes
the fixed point, this muscle lifts the hind part of the body forwards, in which it is materially as8isted by having
a double insertion, viz. on the upper end of the upper leg, and by its slender tendon on the lower, When the
trunk is fixed, this muscle simply draws backwards the limb, effecting at the «ame time a «light flexion of the
lower leg.
