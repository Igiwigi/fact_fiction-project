The hypothesis of some common cause of decrease is ruled out if it is true that
intraspecific competition explains the cycle in the hare. It is, in any case, difficult to
imagine any single factor except weather which might be capable of bringing about simul-
taneous decrease in both species; and it is virtually certain that the decrease itself is not
caused by a cycle in weather or other climatic factors. Among other objections to such a
view is the fact that decrease from peak numbers may occur in almost every year in some
part of North America (Clarke 1936; H. Chitty 1950). The disappearance of one species probably has some effect upon the other.
