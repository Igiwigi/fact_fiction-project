The dry room samples
also displayed some signs of surface cracking after eight weeks of storage (figure 11). There is
a trend therefore for an increased propensity to form these fissures, or particle pulverization,
more rapidly the ‘wetter’ the storage condition. The fact that the surface morphology has been
physically altered also suggests that the process is irreversible and so a heat treatment prior to
cell assembly may not restore the electrodes original properties, although not reported here in
this study. Similar to the cathode XPS analysis, the ‘as-received’ electrodes as well as samples from
the different storage environments were analysed after nine weeks of storage for the anodes. These mostly comprise carbon from the graphite that makes up most of the anode surface.
