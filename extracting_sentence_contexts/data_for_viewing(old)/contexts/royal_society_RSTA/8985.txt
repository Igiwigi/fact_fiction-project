compared with those in the latter. We have early rough determinations by Ramsay
and associates.* More accurate and complete by RutHerrorp and Roypf, and later
by Warsoy.t In order to diminish the absorption by the electrodes Ramsay also
used copper instead of Pt electrodes and found a number of new lines, the majority of

which have not been seen by succeeding observers. They have generally been
explained as due to contamination by xenon as they lie close to X lines within their
errors of observation. At first sight this explanation would seem to be very natural,
but Ramsay was contident that there was no such contamination. Iam inclined to
suspect that the opinion that these lines belong to X is too hasty. As is well known
Baty found quite a large number of lines in Kr and X coincident within his
observation errors, which indeed were much smaller than those in any measures yet
made in RaEm. Now as a fact those suspected lines of RAmsAy and Camrron’s
are also very close to these Kr lines. A strong argument also is this. There are a
number of strong lines undoubtedly belonging to the RaEm spectrum, and observed
by both Rurnerrorp and Royp and by Watson, which are also near strong X lines,
yet separated so far from them, that if Ramsay and Cameron had had X in their
tube they must have seen them and RaEm lines as double, one due to X and
the other to RaEm. Compare for instance the following lines :—

RaEm,
_ — = x. Kr.
