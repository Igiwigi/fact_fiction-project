not necessary to suppose that the organic interfilamentar junctions are invariably
preceded by the ciliated junctions. It is quite possible that in the history of the
Lamellibranchia the reticulate lamella may have been evolved directly from one
consisting of plain uniformly ciliated filaments. In ontogeny this is certainly some-
times the case. Jackson has shown that in the young Ostrea the gills begin to
develop as “two rows of filamentous appendages” (88, p. 303) or “ tubular discon-
nected bags” (p. 305), and that the interfilamentar connections are brought about by
the concrescence of fleshy processes from the margins of adjoining filaments, the first
formed junction being that connecting the not yet reflected tips of the filaments.
In this he confirms the earlier researches of Horst on the same genus (84, fig. 19,
and p. 303).

The fact that in ontogeny the reticulate or synaptorhabdic gill-lamella may arise
by the perforation of a continuous membrane, and not by the actual conerescence ot
separate filaments by a new growth of subfilamentar tissue, does not in reality
invalidate the argument that the filamentous condition is the more archaic, since the
process may not unreasonably be regarded as an abbreviation of the normal mode
such as is indicated by the comparative study of the gills of adult forms. No
embryonic gills were examined in the present investigation, but it may be noted that
the observation of Stepanorr’s on the perforation of the gill-membrane of Cyclas
(= Spherium) (98, p. 27, and figs. 17, 19, 20), upon which Posner’s line of argu-
ment was largely based, was in complete accord with the earlier observations of
Leypia (Cyclas (= Spherium), 54, figs. 17 and 18); and the mode of development
has since been found to occur in Teredo (Harscuek, 82, p. 22, and figs. 26-29, and
Siaerroos, 93), and in Scioberetia (Brrnarp, 2, pp. 376 and 382).
