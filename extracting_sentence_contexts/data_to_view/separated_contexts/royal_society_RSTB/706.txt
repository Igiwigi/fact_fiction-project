Such are the problems of which the solution
is attempted in the following studies,

The first step, clearly, was to make one’s self acquainted with all the various
organisms, or forms, found in the fermenting mixture, and then to determine which
were essential, and which (if any) were mere intruders or foreign organisms having
nothing to do with the changes in question. It is equally clear that the only
satisfactory way to accomplish this end was to separate and cultivate each form
by itself, in a pure state. This entailed very numerous, and, in part, wearisome
attempts, and the magnitude of the task is best understood from the fact that

my notes refer to very nearly two thousand separate cultures, each extending over
periods of from several days to months, and even in some cases to two years. Tiresome as some of the failures were, however, and especially those due to the
interruptions inseparable from the conditions under which investigations must be
carried on in a busy teaching laboratory, there is so much that is fascinating in such
work, that it more than repays one for the trouble and disappointments, in the
interest it excites,
