Likewiſe, to the blood being at reſt, is probably
owing its coagulation in the large arteries which are
tied after amputation, or other operations; for after
moſt of ſuch ligatures there will be a part of the
artery impervious, in which the blood can have no
motion. The coagulum after amputation might in-
deed be ſuppoſed owing to air ; but, conſidering the
manner in which arteries are tied whilſt the blood
is flowing from them, it does not ſeem probable that
the air has any effect on what is above the ligature,

To the blood's being without motion in the cavity
of the uterus, is its coagulation therein probably
owing ; hence the origin of thoſe large clots which
we ſometimes obſerve to come from this cavity, and
which, when they are more condenſed by the ouzing
out of the ſerum, and of the red particles, aſſume
a fleſh-like appearance, and have often been called
moles or falſe conceptions. In Experiment the 5th, we found that the blood
could be frozen and thawed again, without being
coagulated: this, likewiſe is'an experiment which

I have repeated ſeveral times, that I might be ſure
of the fact. I have alſo varied the experiment a
little, having ſometimes put the vein into a phial
of water, and froze the whole in a ſolution of ſal
ammoniac in ſnow; and ſometimes I have put the
vein into the ſolution itſelf; and three or four times I
< have put it into oil, and then froze it 3 but after all
S thels trials, the reſult was found to be the ſame, The
2 blood was always evidently fluid on being thawed,
= and as evidently jellied when expoſed to the air. EZ Thus far I have related ſuch experiments asT have

Z lation of the blood, out of the body.
