pected. Another surprise, especially considering the great
breadth of the Gona pelvis, is the very diminutive body size
implied by its small acetabulae, which are more similar in size
to those of australopithecines than to other H. erectus [2,82]. In
contrast to the majority of the fossil evidence, which suggests
that body sizes in H. erectus were in the modern human range
(summarized in reference [2]; although see [90,117,118]), Gona
indicates either very high levels of sexual dimorphism or


great intraspecific variation in body size [82,83]. Ruff [2] has
questioned these unexpected conclusions about H. erectus,
countering that Gona may in fact represent Australopithecus
(see [83] for Simpson et al.â€™s response).

In sum, early Homo provides another illustration of power-
ful, conflicting selective pressures acting on the pelvis: while a
greater overall width was beneficial for non-rotational partur-
ition, a narrower pelvis was more advantageous in terms of
both locomotor efficiency and thermoregulation in hot cli-
mates. However, it is important to keep in mind the lessons
of the Gona fossil, which, like Au. sediba, shows that there
was significant postcranial diversity among Pleistocene homin-
ins, and details of mosaic evolution in specific populations
may contrast with overall long-term trends [92].
