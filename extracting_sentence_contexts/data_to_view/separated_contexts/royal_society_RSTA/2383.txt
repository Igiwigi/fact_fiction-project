Note that throughout this process of the change of y(0), the function fr satisfies (H1) and
(H2), and as a result fy satisfies (H3). It is now intuitively clear that close to the balance point
system (1.1) and (1.2), as a (small) perturbation of (2.2), exhibits a long transient solution with
initial conditions close to the balance point. In fact, in the next section, we provide strong
arguments in favour of these solutions not being mere transients any more, but delay-induced
switched states. We conjecture that conditions (H1)-(H3) are necessary conditions on f to allow
for such states.

3. Main result: balance point and delay-induced switched states

As we will show in ยง4, all solutions of (1.1) and (1.2) for 7 >0 that are not converging to or
identically zero are oscillating, i.e. its first component possesses infinitely many sign changes for
t > 0 (propositions 4.1 and 4.2).
