Above the superionic transition temperature, the system is not able to accommodate this DR
directional preference for all Ag ions, leaving some ionically bonded Ag* ions free to migrate— : 4
a characteristic signature of chemical frustration and its effect on ion mobility. In addition, the : e
partial covalent bonds were found to break and form continually above the superionic transition :8
temperature, leading to fluctuations in local bond chemistry that are harnessed for diffusion. [gf

This same bond-fluctuation analysis was later applied to Li3InBrg_,Cl, [43,44] to demonstrate Q

a similar signature of bimodal coexistence of ionic and partial covalent bond character for the
Li-Br interactions [35,36]. Although weaker than in a-Agl, this bond signature demonstrated that
similar signatures of covalency can be detected even in Lit conductors if polarizable anions are
present [35], reflecting the fact that bonds between small cations and large anions can possess a
degree of covalency. Further analysis of mobile Lit hops confirmed that this coexistence of ionic
and polar covalent bond character—and its accompanying frustration—were indeed relevant
contributors to ionic mobility. We also showed that Cl/Br alloying could be used to maximize
chemical frustration by properly matching anion size to facilitate simultaneous interaction with
multiple Lit neighbours [36].
