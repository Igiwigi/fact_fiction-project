I 1. That the temperature of an animal is raised by muscular exercise, is a fact gene-
rally admitted and proved by common experience. M. BECQUEREL having introduced
the point of a thermo-electric pile into a muscle of the human body, found an increase
of temperature during contraction which amounted to a degree Centigrade : Mr. NewPorT
also discovered a remarkable increase in the temperature of insects while in movement.
M. BxcqueRtL attributed this increase of temperature in muscles during contraction to
the greater activity of sanguineous circulation which apparently takes place in a muscle
in that state. In support of this interpretation, M. BEcqQUEREL 8howed, that, by com-
pressing one of the large arteries distributed in a muscle under experiment, an immediate
decrease of temperature takes place in that muscle. M. BERNARD discovered an increase
of heat in one of the ears of a rabbit or dog after having cut the cervical ganglion con-
nected with the nervous filament of that ear: this remarkable fact is also associated in
80me unknown manner, depending on the peculiar action of the ganglionic system, with
a more rapid capillary circulation of blood in the ear in which the temperature is highest.
It remained therefore still to be proved by experiment whether an increase of tempera-
ture is produced by the act of contraction in a muscle which is separated from the body,
and as far as possible is deyoid of blood, in which consequently sanguineous circulation
is extinct. The experiment was easily made and the result not doubtful.

I employed for this purpose two thermometers such as those used in M. REGNAULT'S
hygrometer, and constructed by M. Fasrrt. The cylindrical bulb of these thermometers
is very 8mall, and by means of a telescope I could read distinctly variations of 3th of a
degree Centigrade. I had two cylindrical wide-mouthed glass bottles of about 100 cub.
cent., provided with good cork stoppers. One of these corks was traversed by two thick
