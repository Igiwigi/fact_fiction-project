Remarkably, the dependence of various conditional averages on Â¥ follows a simple dimensional
consideration. The three mechanisms are further analysed in the eigenbasis of strain tensor, defined by its
eigenvalues 4; and eigenvectors e; (for i=1,2,3), revealing a more complex picture. Since 41
is always positive and Az is positive on average, it follows that the self-amplification term in
fact leads to depletion for these eigenvalues, whereas the vortex stretching and pressure Hessian
terms lead to amplification. Surprisingly, the self-amplification and vortex stretching terms cancel
each other and the net amplification is solely provided by the pressure Hessian term. By contrast,
the behaviour of all these terms for the third eigenvalue (which is always negative) is similar to
that of total strain, revealing that extreme events of strain result from strong self-compressive
action.
