u(t)€ D(Am)N D(B) <=> Lyx(t)€D(B) <=> x(t) € D(N)).

Thus, it suffices to show that (iaP1,) holds for u(-) if and only if (iaCPy,) holds for x(-). This,
however, is easily verified by a simple and straightforward computation. The last affirmation
follows since by [9, Cor. 4.2.2] the inhomogeneous Cauchy problem (iaCPy,) has at most one
solution which, if it exists, is given by (4.2). a

5. The problems (aP2) and (iaP2)

In this section, we show equivalence of the homogeneous problem (aP2) and the abstract Cauchy
problem (aCP,») for the operator A? with abstract generalized Wentzell boundary conditions.
This fact is then used to characterize the well-posedness of the associated inhomogeneous
problem (iaP2). In the remaining two subsections, we then ‘decouple’ (aP2) into two independent
simpler abstract Cauchy problems on Xo and @X, respectively.

(a) The homogeneous case

Theorem 5.1. The following assertions are equivalent:

(a) The homogeneous problem (aP2) with dynamic boundary conditions is wellposed.
(b) The abstract Cauchy problem (aCP 4s) is well-posed.
(c) The operator A® defined in (3.2) generates a Co-semigroup on X.

Proof. Since (b) and (c) are equivalent by [8, Thm. 3.1.12], it is sufficient to prove the equivalence
