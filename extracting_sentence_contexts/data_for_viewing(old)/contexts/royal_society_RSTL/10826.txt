T. A side tube, L, carries off the overflow from the trough. The end of the
wire P, and a small platinum plate Q immersed in the liquid of the trough, form
the electrodes between which the current is passed (in either direction), The
telephonic effects with this arrangement are exactly similar in kind to those
obtained from an air-jet with a small hearing orifice. The loudes sounds are
heard when P is placed in the axis of the jet at a certain distance from the orifice ;
and the reproduction grows fainter as the electrode P is moved from this poxition,
either towards the orifice or laterally.

The telephonic effects are feeble, but such as they are they cannot be attributed to
the interposition of varying liquid resistances between the conductors.

Under these conditions, in fact, a liquid jet becomes comparable to a jet of air.


MR. C. A. BELL ON THE SYMPATHETIC VIBRATIONS OF JETS. 411

If the jet liquid be coloured the analogy becomes strikingly evident. At low pressures
the continuous part of the stream of coloured liquid is elongated and unsteady, being
eagily 8wayed about by currents in the surronnding liquid : and where it becomes
discontinuous it either branches or forms a divergent cone. In this condition it is
not sensitive to 8ounds of high pitch ; but a musical tone of low pitch, or a gentle tap
on the supporting sound-board, causes it to break quite close to the orifice, As the
pressure is increased the breaking point first recedes from and then approaches the
orifice ; and when the velocity is 80 great that the jet visibly responds to high tones,
