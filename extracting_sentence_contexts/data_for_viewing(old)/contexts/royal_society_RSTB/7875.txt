number of spores characteristic of the genus. It is possible that some of the spores are
genetically abnormal and non-viable as a result of the loss of function due to the hypogeous
habit.

The spores develop by the aggregation of cytoplasm around the nuclei and the secretion
of a wall. The remaining cytoplasm of the ascus is used up in the formation of the
intricately sculptured spore walls. As might be expected, the size of the spores is inversely
correlated with the number in the ascus.

All species of Tuber show considerable changes in shape, colour and other characters
during development. Variation within the species, due partly to differences in environ-
mental factors, is often considerable. It is thus difficult to formulate descriptions that will
permit the ready identification of specimens at all stages of development. In fact no one
character is sufficient to separate species, and a number of such characters as presence or
absence of warts on the peridium, colour, texture, venation of gleba,{ shape of asci,
number of spores in the ascus and size, shape and sculpturing of the spores must be con-
sidered. For this reason the key given below is supplemented by a table of characters
(table 2). It is certain that the confusion which still exists in the classification of this
genus is partly a result of different specific names having been given to the same species
according to its age or to its response to environmental variations.

Several attempts to divide the genus into subgenera have been made. Thus Vittadini
(1831) divides the genus into Tubera spuria and T. genuina (Eu-Tuber), and Wallroth (1833)
separates off the subgenus Aschion (corresponding to Tubera spuria) to include all those,
such as Tuber excavatum, which are of hard or leathery texture. The most satisfactory
