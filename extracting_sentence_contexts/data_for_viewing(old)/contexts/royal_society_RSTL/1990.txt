adapted to allow the particles of the electric fluid to arrange themselves *
round the crystalline particles in that mode which constitutes a magnet.

It is easy to ascertain, before making an electro-magnet, whether a certain
kind of iron be well adapted for the purpose. All that is necessary, is to forge
a small lifter, and try it with a common horse-shoe magnet. If it be power-
fully attracted by the magnet, it is good for the purpose ; if not, it should be
rejected. Having made two lifters, one of them of the best iron I could pro-
cure and the other of the worst, I found that a horse-shoe magnet with the
first would carry only fourteen pounds ; with the second it carried no less
than twenty-seven pounds.

These facts will enable us to obtain the most powerful electric state by the
induction of magnets. A lifter made of the iron T have described will give a
much larger spark than one made of good iron. Another cireumstance to be
attended to in obtaining a large spark, is to use a $hort lifter, with a magnet
having its poles near one another. When the lifter is short, the recomposition
of the electric fluid, on the return of the particles to their natural state, is
almost instantaneous, and consequently induces, for an instant of time, a more
powerful electric state on the coil surrounding it. When the deflection of the
needle is the object, a longer lifter may be employed with adyantage.

That the recomposition of the electric fluid goes on more slowly in a long
than in a short magnet may be shown by the following experiment. Take a long
horse-shoe magnet of soft iron and convert it into an electro-magnet. Change
