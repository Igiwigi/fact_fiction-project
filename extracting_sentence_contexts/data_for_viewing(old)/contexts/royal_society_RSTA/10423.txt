by taking the reading of the last whole millimetre from the scale on the guiding bed,
and then adding the reading for the fraction of a millimetre obtained from the drum ;
the first two places of decimals are given directly by the numbered circle next the
bearing, and the third place is immediately indicated by the red number above the
circle whose intersection with the oblique line falls exactly under the red indicating
line. In practice this mode of determining the thousandth of a millimetre proves
the easiest the author has yet worked with. The fact that a single screw is alone
concerned, and one which is absolutely freed from backlash by the double-nut device,
renders the method highly accurate.

The microscope is required for the measurement of the free length of the plate of
the substance under investigation, that is, the distance between the platinum-iridium
knife-edges against which it is bent ; also for the measurement of the breadth of the
plate. For the determination of the plate’s thickness, the thickness measurer which
the author has previously described (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ A, 1898, vol. 191, p. 387) is
admirably adapted ; it affords the thickness with accuracy to the same unit as the
measuring microscope, namely, the thousandth of a millimetre.

The most convenient length of plate is from 10 to 20 millims., so as to afford a
