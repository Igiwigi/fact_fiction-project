task. Third, adults were accurate in perceiving how difficult a ing between trials 1 and 2, but not to the scale seen in Mesoudi


[24]. The differences in findings could be owing to a number of
factors including the fact that the tasks in this study were not vir-
tual tasks as in Mesoudi’s arrow head design task, and in
Mesoudi [24] adult participants had 90 trials, whereas in this
study participants had one trial on each task. The influence of task difficulty and trial on the preference
for social learning was complicated, varying between chil-
dren and adults. Children’s preferences were not influenced
by described task difficulty in either trial.
