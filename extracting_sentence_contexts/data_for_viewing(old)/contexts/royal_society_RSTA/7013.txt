why the original uplift occurred. A possible explanation would be that at one time an
upward convection current existed below this region. Cooling, owing to convection or a
diminution in the source of supply of heat, possibly because of erosion of the areas raised by
the current, has now brought the circulation to a standstill or even reversed the current.
We are left with an excess of matter and a tendency for the crust to sink. The tertiary
igneous activity found in the Inner Hebrides is possibly connected with the increase in

temperature associated with the rising convection current. The fact that no such activity is
found in the Outer Hebrides may indicate that the original current did not extend as far
west as the present field of positive anomalies. To try to account for the anomalies by
assuming the rocks in this region are abnormally dense is not satisfactory. Even if we take
the density to be 3-0, a thickness of at least 10,000 ft. would be required. To produce any
appreciable effect over such an extensive region they cannot be compensated. For a limited
area, the strength of the earthâ€™s crust might be sufficient to support the additional mass now
present but it does not explain its origin.

4:37. English Channel and Irish Sea (stations 1 to 3 and 46 to 51)

The observations in the English Channel (nos. 1, 2 and 3) are too few to enable any
detailed conclusion to be reached, but the negative anomalies in this area fit in with the
