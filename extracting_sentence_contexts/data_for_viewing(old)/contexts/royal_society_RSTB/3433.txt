subject under certain pathological conditions,

Parathyroids left-behind after removal of the thyroid develop colloid vesicles, and
become practically converted into thyroid. Moreover, the changes in the thyroid,
after removal of the parathyroids, may be interpreted as the reverse change of thyroid
into parathyroid tissue. The experimental evidence as to a separate function for
parathyroids is inconclusive.

9. Thyroid and parathyroids are to be looked upon as structures of somewhat
different embryological origin, which are anatomically separate and distinct in the
lower vertebrata, but which come into very intimate anatomical and physiological
relationships with each other in the mammalia. In this latter group they are, in
fact, to be looked upon as constituting one apparatus.*

* Tt is interesting to note that each of the three “ductless glands,” suprarenal, thyroid-parathyroid,
and pituitary body, consists of portions derived originally from quite separate sources, which come into
intimate relationship in the higher vertebrata. In the case of the suprarenal capsules there is never,
however, any commingling of the constituent cells, nor even a true anatomical continuity, and no

10. Parathyroidectomy, like thyroidectomy, causes compensatory changes in the
pituitary body. These consist in a notable increase of the colloid vesicles in the
pars intermedia.
