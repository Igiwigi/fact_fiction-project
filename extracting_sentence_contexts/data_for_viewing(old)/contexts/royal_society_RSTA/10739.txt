PLATINUM SURFACE AT HIGH TEMPERATURES. 239

The results of WarBuRG and von Baso* have shown that for gases near their
critical temperature, there is a great increase of viscosity as the critical pressure is
approached.

Meyer explains, and at the same time confirms this result, by a calculation based
on the assumption that the gas is a mixture of double and simple molecules.

The relatively large value of the exponents of p (see page 236) in the case of carbon
dioxide and nitrous oxide, may be accounted for by the above fact.

Tt has been shown that the conductivity of a gas is proportional to its viscosity.
staking into account that even the so-called permanent gases diverge considerably
Strom Boye’s law at the higher pressures, it seems probable that the constancy of
Bhis conductivity is far from absolute.

5 A glance at figs. 2 to 6 will show that in every case a sharp fall occurs in the
murve of emissivity when 9 decreases below a certain limit ;+ and from such measure-
‘oments as have been made at small temperature intervals there can be no doubt that
Sat pressures above 10 or 20 atmospheres the conductivity accounts for only a very
semall proportion of the total heat dissipated, but none the less the conductivity may
Shave considerably increased in absolute value.
