We have therefore exactly the same equations to combine as before, with the sole

exception that = occupies the place of £,; we have therefore only to make this

simple change in the value of sin 9, and we obtain

with the same expressions for the comparative. brightness as before. See No. 16,
23. 'The first of the above equations, compared with the Cartesian law of refraction,
regarded as an experimental truth, shows that s is independent of 9; in fact,

and since by the Cartesian law S4p is independent of 9, it follows that s is also inde-

pendent of 8. This quantity must therefore be regarded as a certain coefficient of
absorption, depending mainly on the constitution of the crystal and the period of the
incident ray, possibly also in some degree on the orientation of the ray, or the posi-
tion of the plane in which its vibrations are performed, with regard to certain fixed
planes in the crystal, or refracting medium, whether solid or fluid. Tae theoretical
determination of this coefficient can only result from a more perfect theory of reso-
nance than has hitherto been given, and it is hoped that some of the great modern
analysts will turn their attention in this a ——_

This very simple formula, now given for the first time, demonstrates the rule I
have before ennnciated, namely,

The solar rays can exercise no action upon any medium through which they are trans-
mitted without an accompanying diminution of the refractive index.

24, To estimate the effect of this dimination upon the intensities (7, 7,) of the
reflected and refracted rays, unity as before representing the intensity of the incident
primary ray, we have
