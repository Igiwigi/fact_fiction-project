away ; $0 far, then, it is obvious that the relations of the frame, whether for the pur-
pose of locomotion and action, or of breathing, are perfect, independently of cerebrum
and cerebellum. The question remains, what is the nature of that relation, or of that
influence, maintained by the brain over the neryous system of the body? However
that connexion may hereafter be found to be establisbed, it will not invalidate the
conclusions as to the unity of office of the nerves employed in respiration, and in the
actions where the respiratory apparatus is brought into play.

Before concluding this subject, it is pertinent to notice, that writers have been led
to attribute the entire action of respiration to the sensation in the lungs. To a cer-
tain degree this is undoubtedly true. When I formerly stated, that upon dividing
the par vagum (and with it the sympathetic nerve), and cutting through the spinal
marrow, the act of respiration continued, I established the fact that there was a source
of motion in the respiratory organs independently of any sensation in the lungs. I

may be permitted to doubt, if in common breathing there is any sensation ; we are
certainly not conscious of it. It cannot at least be anything like the exercise of sen-
sibility of which we are conscious, and which is wearied and exhausted by repetition.
There is then, we must apprehend, another source of the regulated drawing of breath,
which excites the respiratory muscles not to occasional and sndden actions, but to
the constant combined action of opening the passages to the air. Even in the de-
capitated head, this influence will cause the muscles of the nostrils to be drawn re-
