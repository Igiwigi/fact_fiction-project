the use of dioxygen scales approximately with body animals: Richman (1958), Clarke & Johnston 1999
weight raised to a power close to 0.75 Kleiber and Savage et al. (2004)

organisms show a transient increase in metabolic rate animals: Janes & Chappell (1995), Chappell et ai.
after ingesting food (heat increment of feeding) (1997), Hawkins et al. (1997), Rosen & Trites
(1997) and Nespolo et al. (2005)
ageing lifespan increases with size for endotherms, but is animals: Finch (1990) and Ricklefs & Finch (1995)

independent of size in ectotherms

stylized facts empirical evidence

stoichiometry chemical body composition of well- and poorly- animals: Hirche & Kattner (1993), Du & Mai (2004),
fed organisms differ Chen et al. (2005) and Molnar er al. (2006)
yeasts: Hanegraaf et al. (2000)
chemical body composition of organisms growing animals: Chilliard et al. (2005), Krol et al. (2005),

at constant food density becomes constant Fink et al. (2006), Ingenbleek (2006) and
Steenbergen et al. (2006)
energy dissipating heat is a weighted sum of three mass animals: Seale et al. (1991)
dissipation flows: carbon dioxide, dioxygen and
