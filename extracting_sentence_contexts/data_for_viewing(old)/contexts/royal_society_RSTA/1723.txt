Here, f as well as ug are given data and u=0 on dQ describes the classical Dirichlet boundary
condition. For more information on the Stokes equation, we refer e.g. to [6-9]. An important tool in
order to rewrite the Stokes equation as an evolution equation and to handle the incompressibility
condition div u=0 is the Helmholtz projection P, allowing us to decompose the function space
LP(Q) := L?(2;R") for 1 < p < on into the solenoidal space LP (Q) and gradient fields for a large
class of domains 2 CR".

It is a well known fact that the Helmholtz decomposition exists for p = 2 for arbitrary open sets : =
2 CR". Also, the Stokes operator A2, defined in this context via form methods, is a self-adjoint : =
operator on oa (@), and hence the generator of an analytic semigroup (e!42).59 on L2(Q). 3

For the analysis of strong solutions to the originally given nonlinear systems, as well as for 2
their stability properties and the existence of periodic solutions, it is very helpful to know under [8
which conditions well-posedness and stability results for the Stokes equation transfer from the : o

Starting from this situation, we discuss in the following the first results on the Stokes
