Though the evidence against the excalation theory may not amount to very much,
yet it must be remembered that the evidence for it is also slender, and such being the
case it seems best to turn to a theory which offers an explanation of all the facts, and
to attribute these various phenomena to the migration of the limb. We must suppose
that the whole limb has secondarily wandered forward, and that simultaneously
