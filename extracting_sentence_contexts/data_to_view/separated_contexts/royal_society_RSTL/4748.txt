The Hemorrhoidal Nerves. —The rectum is supplied by minate filaments which
come from the posterior border of the pelvic plexus, and accompany for the most
part the branches of the hemorrhoidal artery. They, however, are not. the direct
continuation of those nerves which accompany the superior hazemorrhoidal artery, for
these end in the posterior border of the pelvic plexus. The analogy which exists between the different collections of Ganglia.—From the
foregoing facts it will appear that a great analogy exists between the collections of
ganglia at the celiac axis, at the superior hamorrhoidal artery, and at the pelvic
plexus. |, The same elements exist in each, viz. tubular nervous fibres derived from

the spinal cord, and gelatinous nervous fibres derived from the ganglia; the size
of the ganglia being in apparent relation to the quantity of gelatinous fibres required
for the nerves distributed from these points. The constitution of the nerves which
come from these ganglia differs according to the size of the ganglia.
