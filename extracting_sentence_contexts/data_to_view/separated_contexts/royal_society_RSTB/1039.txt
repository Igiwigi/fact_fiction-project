12. Stages in the origin of blastomeres, in the way above described, from the yolk have
evidently been observed by Lane, Nusspaum, and Nasonoy, though the first-named
stated that the appearance indicated the position of the blastopore, while both the
latter would apparently regard it simply as the nucleus of the larger cell. That it
does not mark the position of the blastopore is evident from the fact that it doesnot
coincide with the point of closure of the blastoderm in any of the forms I have
studied ; moreover, similar cells are seen to arise in quite different positions at later
stages, sometimes two or more at a time. That it is not a mere nucleus is easily
seen by examination. Korscuerr and Herper, in their excellent â€˜ Lehrbuch der
vergleichenden Entwicklungsgeschichte, truly remark that, judging from Nasonov's
figures, new cellular elements are formed from the yolk.
