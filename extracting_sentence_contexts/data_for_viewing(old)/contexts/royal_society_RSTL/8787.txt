sel{-impregnation occurs is not definitely ascertained, but it seems possible. Legypic
was unable to give a satisfactory account of the arrangement of the ducts and generative
glands from a study of the large Cyclas cornea, and I have not attempted to enter upon
this question with the much smaller Pisidium.

Plate 1. fig. 3 is drawn from an egg removed from the brood-pouch. It is now gra-
nular in the body owing to the inception of deutoplasm, and has undergone impregnation,
This is inferred from the fact that it is enclosed in a transparent enyelope or egg-shell
of membranous consistency. The nucleus and nucleolus scen now in the egg may or
may not be the original germinal yesicle and spot of the egg-cell. Though these
structures disappear in some eggs, it cannot be asserted that they may not be persistent
in others. One point of interest in this and other eggs figured on the Plate is the
presence of the membranous envelope to the egg, which was not found by either LeypiG
or SCHMIDT in their studies on Cyclas.

This fact has been especially insisted upon with regard to Cyclas, and it is therefore
important to note the presence of the envelope in Pisidium, It is very delicate, and is
ruptured and discarded after the first stages of development.

Plate 1. fig. 15 shows a similar egg in its enyelope; in this egg two nucleoli are
