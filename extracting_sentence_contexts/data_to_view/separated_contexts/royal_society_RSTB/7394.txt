RIGHARDS ON PHYLLOTAXIS

notable exceptions. In Podocarpus, for instance, a (5+ 8) apex appears above a (6+ 10); or
again, the (7+-11) Araucaria apex has the same index as the (5+ 6) Lycopodium apex, and
apparently a lower one than even the (5+5). These discrepancies arise, of course, from the
fact that the contact parastichies in the various apices intersect at very different angles, and
hence do not really indicate the ‘bulk-ratios’, as Church assumed. The area ratio on the
other hand is a direct measure of precisely this kind and its logarithm is linearly related to
the phyllotaxis index, when the transverse component of the system is alone under con-
sideration, i.e.

With the aid of a table of natural logarithms it may be obtained even more simply from the
plastochrone ratio, as the reciprocal of 2 log, r.*

15. AREA RELATIONS INVOLVING THE APICAL SURFACE

Theoretical measures such as bulk ratio, which depend for their validity on some defined
and simple primordium shape, fail when the attempt is made to apply them to actual
apices, where the primordia are of differing and uncertain forms.
