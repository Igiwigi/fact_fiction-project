A pure tin wire was used. Owing to the great internal viscosity of this metal,
the torsional periods could not be timed with the accuracy obtained in the case of

the harder metals; for the oscillations damped down so quickly that only a
comparatively small number took place. The difficulties of observation were also
increased by the fact that, although a light aluminium vibrator was used with the
wire, it underwent a considerable elongation, especially at the higher temperatures.
At the second heating to 100° ©. this elongation was so great that the vibrator
moved about in jerks as the wire gave way, and rendered timing impossible.

It was found that the rigidity of the wire at the ordinary laboratory temperature
was diminished by repeated heatings, and that when the wire was allowed to rest at
one temperature its rigidity increased as time went on. The curve in Diagram VIII.
