The issue of charge transport and charge mobility is obviously central to any
electronic and optoelectronic device and is thus not surprising that it has been
addressed by many speakers, with different approaches. In their illuminating
contribution, Bassler and collaborators provide precious insight into the nature
of charge mobility in conjugated polymers by clarifying the different phenomena
taking place on the different time-scales and emphasizing the role of disorder. In
this way, they lead us to appreciate the intrinsic limitations and the potential of
nanostructured organic electronic devices. In particular, they point the way to
the attainment of high charge mobility and fast logic applications, which should
be in reach once devices can be designed so as to exploit the fact that, on a time-
scale of typically 100 fs, the on-chain mobility is ultrahigh and controlled by the
electronic bandwidth of the polymer chain, rather than by disorder. It is only
when a carrier hits a chain imperfection that subsequent mesoscopic on-chain
motion is retarded and controlled by intra-chain disorder to which the chain
environment contributes.

Interestingly, one approach to the control of the micro-environment of the
conjugated semiconductor via nanoscale confinement, in one dimension, is
then presented by Frey and co-workers, who show how semiconducting
polymers can be incorporated into layered inorganic matrices to form
lamellar nanocomposites prepared by a solution co-assembly technique. This
provides the means of generating an entire class of new supramolecularly
