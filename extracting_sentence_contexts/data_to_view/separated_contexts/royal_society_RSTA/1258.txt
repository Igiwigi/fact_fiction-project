NICOLE; [3]). However, these techniques are extremely demanding computationally. In addition to the effects of spatial resolution, multi-components can arise from the fact that
chromospheric spectral lines sample a wide range of heights; from the mid-photosphere (wings of
the line), through to the upper chromosphere (core of the line), thus mixing very different physical
regimes [4]. Additional spectroscopic components that are superimposed on top of the quiescent
background spectral profile can arise from a wealth of solar phenomena, including dynamic
events such as magnetic reconnection, propagating waveforms, and shock development, all of
which have the ability to form across a range of atmospheric heights. This adds a secondary
component to an otherwise quiescent atmosphere [5], which is often highly Doppler-shifted
relative to the approximately stationary line core, creating a significantly broadened resultant
spectral profile.
