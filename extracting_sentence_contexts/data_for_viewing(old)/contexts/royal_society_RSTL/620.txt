This disk, being hotter than the thermoscope, gives to it con-
tinually, more radiant caloric than it receives from it; and,
were it not for the simultaneous loss of caloric which the instru-
ment sustains, in its interchanges with the cold disk A, its
quantity of caloric would be augmented, and it would become
hotter.

Now, as the temperature of the ball of the thermoscope is an
arithmetical mean between that of the disk A and that of the
disk B, it is reasonable to suppose, that the thermoscope receives
just as much more caloric from B than it gives to it, as it gives
to A more than it receives from it; and, if that be the case in
fact, it is evident, that the simultaneous actions of the two disks
on the ball of the thermoscope (or the traffic which they carry
on with it in caloric) can neither tend to increase, nor to di-
minish, the original stock of that substance belonging to that
instrument ; consequently, the instrument will neither be heated,
nor cooled, by these interchanges, but will continue invariably
at the same constant temperature.

This explanation is plausible; but, before the hypothesis on
which it is founded can be admitted, we must see if it will agree
with the results of other experiments; for the greatest care
ought always to be used in the admission of hypotheses in phy-
sical researches ; and, in no case can it be more indispensably
