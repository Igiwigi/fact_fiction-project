glands are so different phylogenetically as ZorrsrMAN assumes. We must confess
we find it difficult to picture to ourselves the first origin of the cervical gland, and
especially to conceive of it as arising de novo from the sinus-ectoderm, altogether
without relationship to an entodermal thymus. That difficulty would be surmounted
could it be shown that it. took origin from a purely entodermal thymus IT as the
result of a gradual process of substitution whereby the original entodermal basis of
the gland became more or less completely replaced by ectodermal cells derived from
the walls of the cervical sinus, but it must be admitted that the evidence for such a
mode of origin is not of a very convincing character. It may be pointed out, however,
that the cervical gland of Trichosurus probably does include an entodermal component,
even if small, and might consequently be regarded as more primitive than the purely
ectodermal gland of Talpa or Sus, whilst the possibility of the occurrence of such a
process of substitution as is indicated above is testified to by the fact already set forth
that in certain mammals (Sus, Cavia, Tarsius) the primordium of thymus III does
actually receive a contribution from the sinus-ectoderm., Then, as concerns thymus IT,
it may be noted that, although it is unknown in any adult mammal, its supposed
primordium has been described by Prerson (48), and by Sounm and VeRpuN (57) in
the Rabbit (though Hanson (23) expressly states he failed to find it), whilst amongst
reptiles, thymus IT has been described in Lacerta and other lizards by a number of
investigators [pk, Mruron (36), vAN BemMELEN (4), Maurer (33), Perer(42)], and
also by Sarnt-Remy and Prenant (51) in Anguis.

Lastly as regards the occurrence of the cervical gland in the Marsupialia, so far as
we know at present, the gland is confined to the Diprotodontia, but the evidence is not
yet sufficient to justify the statement that it occurs in all of them. So far, it has not
