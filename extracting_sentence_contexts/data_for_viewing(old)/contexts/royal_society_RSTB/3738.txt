all cases eyes with a simple upright retina and a simple cuticular lens,” a description
which will not fit any pineal eye known to us. In the pineal eye—in Cyclostomes,
Lacertilia and Sphenodon—there is a cellular lens (when a lens is present at all), and
the retina is of the so-called compound type, that is to say, it contains ganglion-cells.
JASKELL (1908, 1910) has endeavoured to explain away the importance of these
ganglion-cells by comparing them to what LAanKEster and Bourne (1883) have
described as connective tissue cells in the median eye of Limulus. The ganglion-cells
in the retina of the pineal eye are, however, certainly not connective tissue cells ;
while GASKELL'S ingenious suggestion, that in the Lamprey they may be ganglion-
cells which have migrated along the pineal nerve, does not meet with the slightest
support from the study of Sphenodon, in which they certainly develop in situ in the
retina. In short, the retina of the pineal eye is undoubtedly a compound retina, in
the sense that it contains a well-developed layer of ganglion-cells, and this fact cannot
be ignored or explained away in any comparison with the median eyes of Arthropods.
The two types of eye, indeed, are fundamentally different in structure, as a comparison
of LANKEsTER and Bourne's figure of the median eye of Limulus (1883, Plate XII,
fig. 27) with any modern figure of the pineal eye of a lamprey or lizard, or a tuatara,
_ will at once demonstrate, to say nothing of the differences in their development.

1X.—Tue Sup-ComMissuRAL ORGAN AND RerssNER's FIBre.

The sub-commissural organ (= ‘“ ependymal groove”) and Reissner’s fibre are both
very strongly developed in the Tuatara, and have the usual structure and relations.
The former occurs in the form of a deep longitudinal groove, horseshoe-shaped in
transverse section, lying beneath the posterior commissure (text-figs. 10, 12, 18, 20,
