growth, both because of the greater amount of its tissue in the plastic condition, and
because of the probably greater responsiveness of the cambium when active than when
in its dormant condition. We have a series of experiments to determine the season
when the response is greatest, which will not be complete for another year, but there
are already indications by the appearance of the over-growth that the response is
directly related to cambial activity. Thus vigour of growth may provide conditions
favourable to wounding and the production of resin canals, but the direct responsibility
does not rest here.

Since, then, neither food supply nor vigour of growth can, as such, be directly con-
nected as the causal factor with the production of resin canals, theories based on such
accessories only distract attention from the main issue and prevent a proper interpreta-
tion of the facts. With such misconceptions cleared away, we may now turn to a more
detailed study of wounding and its results in Picea.

5. PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS AND EXPERIMENTAL WorK.

The sporadic nature of the occurrence of resin canals in mature spruce wood at once
suggested that the causal agency might prove to be some external accidental factor such
as wounding. The abundance of apparently normal canals in such wood, however,
prevented the definite delimitation of the effects of individual wounds, and so it did
not prove so favourable a field as that of the young plant for preliminary investigation.
Especially valuable in this connection were some seedling black spruce (Picea mariana),
found growing wild in a peat bog in Muskoka, where no domestic animals interfered with
them. These showed very little external evidence of wounding, although concealed
