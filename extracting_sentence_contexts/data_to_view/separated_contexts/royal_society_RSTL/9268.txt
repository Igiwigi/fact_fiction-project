(2.) On the side of the tinfoil towards the negative end of the tube a conical column of
luminosity is seen to start from the inside of the tube immediately beneath
the tinfoil, and to stretch towards the negative terminal. This cone, in fact,
forms the base of the new positive column. (3.) On examination, this luminous cone is found to be hollow, the interior having
an ill-defined and hazy surface in strong contrast with the somewhat sharp

A and regular outline of the exterior (Plate 16, fig. 10).
