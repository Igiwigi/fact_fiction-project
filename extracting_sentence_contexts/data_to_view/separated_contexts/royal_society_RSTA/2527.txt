is taken as the unit of pressure dS/dp = 0°0013,
this means an increase in the value of S of 0°065 per cent. for an increase of pressure
of 1m. of mercury. Experimentally, the value of dS/dp is found to be about twice
as great as this, but, taking into consideration both the smallness of the correction
and the fact that the barometer only varied by about 2 cm, during any one series of
experiments under identical conditions, the agreement is very satisfactory. A pressure
