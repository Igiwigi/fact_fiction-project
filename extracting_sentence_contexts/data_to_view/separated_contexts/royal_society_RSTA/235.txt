For a symmetrically heated slab of thickness 2l, the time lag between surface and centre
is /?/2D, and for a symmetrically heated solid cylinder of radius a it is a’/4D; these values
follow directly from formulae (15) and (16) of Williamson & Adams (1919). The numbers 2
and 4 in the formulae for the time lag in these two cases are very closely related to the
coefficients 2 and 4 in equations (3-5) and (3-8) respectively. In fact, in both these cases the
distribution of temperature through the slab or cylinder ultimately become parabolic (see
formulae (15) and (16) of Williamson & Adams 1919), and then the fundamental approxima-
tions (3-2) of the present method is exact, so equations (3-5) and (3-8) are exact and can be
used to go from centre to surface in one interval 6x for the plane, and similarly for the cylinder;

and the time-lag property for constant rate of rise of surface temperature can easily be
deduced from these equations. Now for a substance for which the diffusivity varies with the temperature, it has been

shown in § 9 that if the diffusivity does not vary greatly through the material at any one time
(though it may vary considerably in the course of time), the heat flow can be reduced

approximately to the heat flow in a substance of constant diffusivity on a distorted scale of
time which has been called the T-scale. Hence, if the rise of surface tem

‘ perature is constant on the 7-scale, the central temperature
will follow the surface temperatur

€ with a time lag which is constant on the t-scale (and which

on this scale has a value of } for a slab and } for a cylinder), and which varies on the ¢-scale
according to the value of the diffusivity, that is, according to the mean temperature.
