it is gradually washed away from the centres—hence the halos—or aggregates for a
time about them. The red and yellow pigments enter and leave their centres as
often as appropriate changes of light-condition occur. In the animals in their natural
surroundings, these movements of yellow and red pigment take place, as we have
shown, at least twice a day, at nightfall and at daybreak. But there is no evidence
to show that the blue pigment, once it has left the centre and finds itself outside the
branches, may re-enter. It may be likened to a secretion and differs in physical, and
probably in chemical, properties from the red and yellow pigments. Moreover, unlike
these latter it, except in the case of green Hippolyte, plays no protective réle ;
blueness on dark nights at sea confers no advantages. It must be regarded either as
a prdision for a possible green episode in the colour-history of the animal or as being
of no protective value. The former hypothesis meets with no confirmation from such
facts as we possess. Many [Hippolyte, as we know, have no period of greenness. It is
with the greatest difficulty that a brown Hippolyte can be induced, even after weeks of
enforced sojourning on Zostera, to make any show of greenness. Therefore we regard
the blue pigment as nof*sharing any such protective function as may be supposed to
fall to the lot of red and yellow pigment. Physically it is far more diffuse than these
pigments and it is more readily destroyed, for instance, it disappears suddenly when
the animal is subjected to a temperature of 60° C. Nevertheless, the blue pigment

seems certainly to be related to the red and yellow. It arises in the same

chromatophores as these. It appears later than these and increases in amount as

they increase. It makes its appearance about the chromatophores in young animals
