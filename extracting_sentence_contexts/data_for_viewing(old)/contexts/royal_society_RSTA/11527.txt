is retina to cause a ae of light, and with another smaller dise observed at the
same distance to only s5}ea, then every ray in the spectrum, when illuminating the
game size of discs, will have to be reduced in the same proportion.

6. The most Sensitive Condition of the Retina.

In all observations of extinction, the greatest care must be taken to obtain the
most sensitive condition of the eye, and I have found that it is useless to attempt any
readings until the eye has been placed in darkness for at least twelve minutes. It is
well to vary the plan of reading by first reducing the light till it disappears, and then
to note the exact point when it reappears. The latter would be the best plan to use
entirely, since the eye is in darkness till the very last part of the observation, were it
not for the fact that, in noting the reappearance of the light, we are noting something
less defined than when we are noting its disappearance. The combination of the two
methods has been found to be the most satisfactory plan. A very great difficulty
also often arises in keeping the axis of the eye employed in a line with the object
observed, particularly when it is of very small angular aperture. It has been found
advantageous to have a feeble light which can be flashed momentarily on the aperture
to guide the eye just previous to the disappearance of the light. This is more
particularly the case when it is desired to extinguish with the centre of the retina,
as is the case in these observations. The intrinsic light in the eye is also sometimes
difficult to deal with, but by judiciously recognizing the fact that it exists, and by
giving proper intervals between each observation, one is enabled to surmount this
difficulty. Again, a healthy state of mind and body is most essential when making
observations, as the sensitiveness of the eye largely depends on it.
