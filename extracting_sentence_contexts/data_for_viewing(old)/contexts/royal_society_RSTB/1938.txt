its fibres (K6nu1KER). There was no evidence from degeneration as to the course of
the fibres arising in the end-nucleus. It is, however, probable, reasoning by analogy,
that they cross the raphé and are continued cerebralwards in the tegment of the
medulla, pons, and crus cerebri. ; :

In dealing with the cerebral continuation of these two nerves, there is no direct
evidence from degeneration of the passage of their secondary neurons across the
raphé. As regards the crossing of the sensory trigeminal fibres, the clinical facts,
however, are sufficiently explicit, for, in the cases in which the tegmentum cruris
was divided, anesthesia of the face coincided with that of the body and limbs on the
opposite side. It would therefore appear that the cerebral continuations of the
afferent cranial nerves (with the exception of the auditory) lie in the tegment of the
hind brain, in close relation with the sensory tracts of the body and limbs.

Bucurerew (12) places the central continuation of the vagus and trigeminal
nerves amongst the so-called “scattered fillet fibres,” which lie internal to the chief
fillet. According to him, their termination is in the parietal region of the cortex
cerebri. Epivcer (31), on the other hand, working with the myelination method,
places the central tract of the trigeminal nerve in the dorsal part of the tegment,
lateral and rather ventral to the posterior longitudinal bundles. The existence ot
