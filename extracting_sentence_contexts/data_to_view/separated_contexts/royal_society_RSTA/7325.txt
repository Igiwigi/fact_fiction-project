To decide whether every bounded reducible star body contains at least one irreducible star
body of equal determinant. Mahler makes the following remark on this problem:

‘It is highly probable that the answer is in the affirmative, and that even a continuous
infinity of irreducible star bodies of the wanted kind exists; but I have not succeeded in
proving this. One reason for this failure is the following fact: If H, K, K,, K., ... are star

bodies such that A(K) = A(K,) = A(Ky) = -.-5
and KOK, OK, oe. ,

then the star bodies K, tend to a limiting set, namely, their intersection, but this set is not
necessarily a star body. Presumably, a proof will be constructive and will consist of a finite
number of steps....If Problem 7 has an affirmative answer, then only irreducible star bodies
need be considered for most purposes, in so far as bounded star bodies are concerned.... The analogous problem for unbounded star bodies has probably a negative answer; but
again, I have not so far succeeded in proving this.’

We decide this problem in appendix 2 by giving an example of a bounded reducible
star body which contains no irreducible star body of equal determinant.
