different seasons of the year, and under a variety of circumstances, frequently
met with discordancies that have baffled every attempt at explanation by any
of the known laws applicable to the subject : and I believe that other persons
also, who have had much practice in pendulum experiments, have occasionally
met with anomalies for which they have been unable to account satisfactorily.
As it is desirable, however, that these difficulties should be cleared up if pos-
si√æle, and as every information connected with s0 important a subject, founded
on such delicate experiments, must add to our means of removing them, I
trust I need not apologize for drawing the attention of this Society to the re-
sults of some experiments, made with pendulums of various forms and con-
struction, immediately bearing on the discordancies in question.

In fact, til] we can construct two pendulums, that will always tell precisely
the same tale, cleared of all these discordancies, the important problem of the
determination of the length of the seconds pendulum cannot be considered as
fully solyed : neither can the observyations of different experimentalists, in dif-
ferent parts of the globe, with different pendulums, be strictly and directly
comparable with each other. It is true that we have two pendulums, in form
and construction totally different from each other, whose results have been
closely compared : viz. Borpa's pendulum, and KarTer's convertible pendulum.
But, although the great accordance in those results, by two such different
means, evince the talent and skill of the distinguished persons engaged in
making the experiments ; yet it should now be borne in mind that the reduc-
tions to a vacuum were, in both cases, made agreeably to the old formula :
and that, since M. BzsstL's important investigations on this subject, which
