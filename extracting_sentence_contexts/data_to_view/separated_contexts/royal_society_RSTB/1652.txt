The fish will often
discharge again after a few seconds, if the skin pressure is maintained, but this
response is frequently only a single one. On the other hand the intensity of the
response itself and the number of successive developments of the peripheral organ
rhythm is not susceptible to fatigue in the same way. The response may be very
powerful, although such as would be evoked by only a single stimulus, and this
even after the fish has been subjected to the squeeze treatment for a considerable
number of times.* This fact has become familiar to us,as to Du Bors-Reymonp, by
many prolonged experimental demonstrations, particularly those in which a large
number of people have successively obtained, by the same method, the discharge
through the hand, as for instance at the Conversazione of the Royal Society, and
that of the British Association at Ipswich, where living specimens of Malapterurus
were shown. An analysis of those reflex records in which the members of a group of responses
recur at the more rapid intervals, shows the following time interval between the
successive members of the group :—

The recurrence of members at intervals of from 4 to 1 sec. or more, although a
very familiar experience, is not worth referring to in detail. The results as to the reflex activity of the organ may be now summarised as
follows :—

(1) The periodicity of the reflex response to the central nerve cell activity is
exceedingly variable. (2) The minimal time observed in a few cases between the
first member of a reflex response and its successor is y'; second. (3) The central
discharge is often of such character that the organ gives only one such member in its
reflex response, this having of course its own peripheral rhythm, (4) Between these
