it is not always easy to correlate the description of one author with that of another.
It is even possible to find that a tooth has been described by different writers as
brachydont and also as hypsodont.

Proportions of the Teeth.

Marruew has used the relative height of the teeth and the progressive evolution of
hypsodontism as important characters in the rhinoceroses, and quotes in his diagram,
fig. 1, four stages: brachydont, sub-brachydont,} hypsodont, and sub-hypsodont.

There is no explanation, in the way of comparative measurement or otherwise, of
what constitutes the difference, for example, between the terms sub-brachydont and
sub-hypsodont beyond the fact that certain species are placed in one or other of the
divisions.

To form some basis on which to work a certain number of forms are here illustrated,
figs. 2, 3, 4. A satisfactory basis is not easy to determine, and, in the first place, it
must be emphasized that only unworn, or at most very slightly worn, teeth are to be

* Even if this is agreed, the difficulties are not quite surmounted regarding the relationships of some
of the Asiatic species mentioned in this paper. Marruew, for instance, has recorded his opinion (1932,
pp. 433-5) that Chilotherium has nothing to do with Teleoceras, but that it is connected with Aphelops.
He states that Aphelops has a rudimentary horn. As Chilotherium is hornless there is here some
inconsistency.
