Some observations on the functions of the nervous system, and the relation
which they bear to the other vital functions. By ALEXANDER PmLIp W1Ls0N

Read April 2, 1829. Trr experiments relating to the function of digestion detailed or referred to
in a paper which I lately had the honour to present to the Society, appear to
throw light on the function of the ganglionic nerves, which hold a higher place
in the animal economy than those either of sensation merely or voluntary
power, being as essentially a vital organ as the heart or lungs, as will more
fully appear, I think, from the review of facts which I now beg leave to submit
to the Society. For the last fifteen years I have been engaged in an experimental inquiry
relating to the laws of the vital functions; and have from time to time laid
the results before the Royal Society in six papers, which the Society has done
me the honour to publish. All the experiments on which the statements are
founded, having been made in the presence of competent witnesses, the rule
from which I never deviated, has been to repeat each experiment till no doubt
respecting the result remained in the mind of any one present ; and it is satis-
factory to me to be enabled to state, that, although many of these experiments
have been repeated by the physiologists both of this country and the continent,
they have in no instance been found inaccurate.
