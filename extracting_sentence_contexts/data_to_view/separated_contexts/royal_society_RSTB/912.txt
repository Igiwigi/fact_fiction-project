The “ escape cells,” so abundant in the teased preparations of the normal winter Eels,
are conspicuous by their absence in similar preparations from stimulated skins. The

process of development of the fibre mass from the club cell and the setting free of the t
contents of the vesicle is far more energetic than in the normal slow secretory proces is
and instead of aslow “shelling out” of the vesicle and its contents, an almost explosive
disruption of the structure appears to occur in stimulation by chloroform vapour. '

soto C, Plate 33), with granular matter round their upper ends, have now taken
e place of club cells with closed vesicles. There can be no doubt that the process
production of the spiral fibre masses from the normal club cells has been the
sult of the excitation, and instead of the process occurring only in the more
veloped clubs nearer the surface, it has occurred in the lower layers to almost equal
