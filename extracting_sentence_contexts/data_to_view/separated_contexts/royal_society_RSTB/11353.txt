Given interactions
involving a high degree of relatedness, cues to pathogen pres-
ence, such as a running nose, diarrhea and vomit, do not
decrease the expected value of contact as they would in the
absence of relatedness. Kinship suspends or at least dampens
contact disgustâ€”and only contact disgust. The fact that kinship has a very different effect in the sexual
domain, where it intensifies disgust, suggests there is a separate
system governing sexual contact. That is, disgust, as a response
designed to guard against the communication of pathogens via
contact, does not automatically buy you sexual avoidance. It
would seem that the same variable, an estimate of genetic relat-
edness, is taken as input by another system, one governing
mate choice, the third system to which disgust is linked.
