The most obvious way to find a solar-like progenitor irradiated /permeated by energetic particles
with energies greater than or equal to 10 MeV would be to look for the particles themselves. But
unfortunately, this is not possible because, even assuming that we had a super-sensitive telescope,
the accelerated protons and nuclei would be deviated by the Galactic magnetic fields, removing
therefore the spatial origin of the particles arriving on Earth. The problem is similar to the one
of searching for the sources of acceleration of cosmic rays and, as in that case, we have to use
the effects of the interaction of energetic particles on the surrounding matter: (i) the emission of
greater than or equal to 280 MeV y-rays, due to the decay of the pions 7‚Äù created when nuclei hit
H atoms [7,8]; (ii) the ionization of the gas [9-11]; and (iii) the heating of the gas. The first method
applies only to particles with energies greater than or equal to 280 MeV and, even assuming
that they are present, is out of reach of present instruments; the last one is too generic to be a
fingerprint of the presence of energetic particles. The second one, the enhanced ionization of the
gas is, instead, a promising one. As a matter of fact, it was used to reveal the presence of freshly
accelerated cosmic rays in molecular clouds close to supernovae remnants, where cosmic rays are
believed to be accelerated [10-12].
