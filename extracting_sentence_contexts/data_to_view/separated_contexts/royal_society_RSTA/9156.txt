Without alteration in value, the determinant is thus changed in form

from V(f,.) to V (df), Where (ef. (5°28) )

In the case of determinants which are infinite in both directions, the operation of
continued differencing by rows and columns is effected by applying the process
described above to each separate quadrant ; thus the differencing by rows is performed
by differencing outwards from the centre row in both directions (above and below),
and likewise, by columns, both to right and left of the centre column. Neither of
these partial operations, nor the complete process, alters the value of the determinant,
a fact which we may express by the equation

(5°30) V (Sr) = V (Ssofra) = V (Suhre) = V (Srafre)s

where the notation is similar to that used in the former case. There, however, 7, s,
and consequently also m, n, were necessarily positive or zero, while our convenient
notation for determinants of the present type involves also negative values of r and s.

In order to make the former definitions of 8, 4,,, 6,, applicable to this case, we must
adopt certain conventions as to the interpretation of (5°28), (5°29), to allow for negative
quantities. These conventions are (a) that in ,C,,,C, the positive numerical values
of r and s, m and n* are to be used in all cases: and (b) that r—m and s—n retain
the same signs as r and s respectively even when m=7, n=s.
