1881-82.—The Discovery of the Calicoblastic, or Lame-forming Cells, and of the
Ectodermal origin of the Madreporarian Skeleton.

Two authors, v. Herper* and v. Kocut may be said to have almost simultaneously
discovered the existence of a skeletal-forming layer of cells in the Madreporarian
polyp. The same year saw also a purely paleontological work devoted entirely to
the discussion of microscopic details of the skeleton and applying those with success
to the systematic grouping of genera. The series of microscopic researches published
by Pratz{ are unique in their kind (vide p. 20). Careful study of this paleeonto-
logical work indicates a certain connection between the observations made by Pratz
on Jurassic and Cretaceous genera and those made on recent corals by v. Kocu and
v. Hemer. But, from the fact that each author had already concluded his own work
before seeing the other's, written contemporaneously, the zoological and the paleon-
tological interests have remained, so to speak, estranged and have mutually missed
all the significance which they might have had. Moreover, v. Kocu and v. Harper
did not agree in the details they gave of the skeletal-forming cell, and the matter
has been somewhat in abeyance. The zoologists who have since published papers
support v. Kocw; hitherto no paleontologist has taken up the question. As I find
it to be one of considerable importance, I shall enter fully into the points of agree-
ment and difference between Koc and HEmwer,

Heer proved in the paper quoted, the general identity in the anatomy and
histology of Cladocora with facts previously determined for Actinians. He writes,
“The brothers Hertwie came to a conclusion (based on their investigations of the
