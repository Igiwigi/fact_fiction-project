Yet the discovery of spiral structure alone, or rather its
rediscovery* in recent years, is probably one of the most far-reaching facts with which
modern cytology has to deal. The realization that the apparent shape of the chromo-
some is merely the external form of a spiral coil must obviously entail very considerable
reorientation of old ideas. The rewriting of descriptive cytology in conformity with
this new knowledge is, however, impossible unless and until the facts regarding it are
fully known. The extreme confusion which now reigns in the literature on several
aspects of spiral structure would therefore seem to be primarily the expression of the
difficulty of obtaining these facts. A contributory cause is unfortunately also the desire
to reach a rapid theoretical explanation of exceedingly complex phenomena, a weak-
ness to which cytologists have always been particularly prone.
