Hermit crabs are no deal-makers and in fact have no qualms evicting previous
owners by force. Barter is present in the primates, though. It is suggested by
reports on high-ranking male chimpanzees ‘bribing’ others by sharing meat
selectively with their allies [3], or raiding papaya plantations of a nearby village
to share the fruits overwhelmingly with fertile females [4]. A well-documented
case is the work on temple macaques in Bali, Indonesia [5]. The monkeys snatch
objects (e.g. smartphones, sunglasses) from tourists after which they patiently

It is hard to define economics, especially in relation to animals. Most
definitions of human economics stress the production and distribution of
goods and services, and the allocation of resources. Some go further and men-
tion the maximization of profit or the minimization of cost, but this is merely a
