The stretching in
fact, begins at the corner D where the flange connects with the parallel part of the tube. The ring R is merely used for holding the two portions of the split nut F in place. Tt will be noticed that in this description the sleeve C plays no part, it might, in fact,
be part of F, when the apparatus is used in the manner described. When it was used
for soft metals like lead and cadmium which do not harden appreciably by cold work it
was found that the method just described does not ensure that there shall be no flow
inside the material of the flange. In these cases, therefore, a cylindrical steel plug with
a small central hole was made to fit the bore of specimen. â€˜The flat faces of the split
sleeve C were then filed so that when the nut L was screwed home, the soft metal was
gripped between the split sleeve C and the cylindrical plug.
