Figure 1. Example songs. Fathers’ songs (a and ¢) and their sons’ songs (b and d). The spectrograms in (a) and (6) show a high father—son song similarity (the
father's song was the top-ranked model), while (c) and (d) show a very low song similarity (the father’s song was ranked 23rd in similarity to the son’s song).

( e) Statistical ana lyses smallest dissimilarity score), the fixed effect was CORT treatment
and the random effect was family ID.

All statistical models were constructed using the ‘Ime4’ pack-
age v. 11-11 in R. To calculate the significance of fixed effects
involving network metrics, and account for the fact that individ-
uals’ social association metrics are not independent of each
other, we used a null models approach [54,55]: we compared
the ‘observed’ test statistic, i.e. the coefficient of the slope from
the linear mixed-effects model of the observed data, with the dis-
tribution of test statistics generated by running the same
statistical model on 10000 permutations of the observed social
associations using the R package ‘asnipe’ v. 1.1.3 [46]. These per-
mutations maintain the same data structure as the data collected
and only incrementally swap single observations of two individ-
uals occurring in different feeding bouts/flocks [54]. This
approach thus maintains, and controls for, aviary ID, the
number and ID of individuals in each aviary, the number of
