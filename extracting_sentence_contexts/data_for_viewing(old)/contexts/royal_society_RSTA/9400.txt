the work needed to detach the hydrogen atom of the — COOH is lessened but the
effect diminishes as the chain is lengthened. It is not possible to assume that ¢ is the
sum of two terms contributed by the two boundary solids,

and that the sum is the same for any pair of solids because it is the same also for two
dissimilar solids—or ¢ = ¢,’ + ¢,""._¢ appears always to be entirely independent of the
solids.

Perhaps the most difficult problem of the boundary state is presented by the fact that
c is positive for the normal reaction and negative for the tangential reaction. The
external force which calls forth the tangential reaction may be taken to be applied as

a traction on the surfaces « and 8, and an increase in the length of molecules whose
long axis was normal to those surfaces would increase the moment of the force at the
surface of slip h/2. But the S$ value relates to a traction and cis positive for this value.

The fact that ¢ is positive for the normal reaction may mean that, whilst a surface
of slip is plane and lies between the ends of molecules, a surface of break is not plane
