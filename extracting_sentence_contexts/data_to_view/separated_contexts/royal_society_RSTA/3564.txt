These [3
approaches are strongly based on the existence of simple generative elements of the complexity. ,
Unfortunately, it is generally difficult to detect such generators even if they exist. One common tool to reduce dimensional complexity are linear and nonlinear projective
methods [12]. Often, these are used without rendering account of the fact that these methods
are designed to modify the relationships between the objects in the description space. This affects
in particular the distance notion underlying clustering (in all of its variants), which provides the
basis of the human perception of objects.

(a) How we perceive objects

Seen from the perspective of physics, humans observe the world primarily by measuring forces
(within themselves as well as related to the world around). Such measurements depend on
several primary given aspects: the properties of the human body itself (most importantly its
mass, the time that its existence covers and the nature of physical properties that the bodyâ€™s
sensors provide).
