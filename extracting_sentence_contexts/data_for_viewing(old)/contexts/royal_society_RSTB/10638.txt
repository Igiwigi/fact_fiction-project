without the use of more advanced methods [266,267] (see
also [268]) or appropriate animal models [269].

Additionally, animal models (in addition to human intra-
cranial recordings and high-field fMRI [270]) might help
to determine whether the putatively awareness-related
surface-negative responses in AC, which correspond well
with similar negativities in vision [25], reflect recurrent pro-
cessing (posited by several models as a critical processing
mode for conscious perception [35,36,271]) either within
auditory association cortex or between it and other brain
areas. While this is suggested by their latency and by the
fact that similar negativities in monkeys arise from superficial
cortical layers [272], more work is needed, particularly in
establishing NCC, experiments in non-human primates.

In the auditory domain specifically, several studies have
suggested the importance of extra-auditory brain areas
[100,103,112,141,145] and late physiological markers
[112,114,254,260] in conscious auditory perception. However,
the same issues of task relevance and use of overt reports that
exist in vision are also relevant here, and studies that have
used passive (in addition to active) versions of NCC, para-
digms have found no evidence for such activity [108,137],
and in some cases specific evidence against it [23]. Thus,
