Using (B) we find, taking values of R, and X,,
2-53. 107? and 5-08 . 10~* respectively, the actual values for the machine,

R,=3:3.10-8, X, =4-62.1072

and (4/R,/Z) f (X/R) = 1915, this bemg proportional to the field from (10). If we take two other neighbouring values of R,, 3°0.10~* and 4:0. 1072, we find values
for (4/R,/Z) f (X/R) of 1-90 and 1-875 respectively, and for intermediate values of R,
figures for (1/R./Z) f (X/R) differing from 1-915 by amounts negligible in the practical
coil. For a coil for which « = 16 and @ = 8, the resistance from (B) is 7-4 . 1073 ohms,
but variations in this figure between the limits 6-5 . 1078 and 1-2 . 107? produce variations
in the field not greater than 1 per cent. at any point, the actual maximum being
at a resistance of 9.10~* ohms with an increase in the field of 0-7 per cent. over that
corresponding to the resistance chosen from (B).

(d) The Effect of the Deviation of the Wave Form from the Sinusoidal Form.—In actual
fact the wave of electromotive force of the machine on open circuit is not sinusoidal, the
armature windings and field form being arranged to give a wave which is, neglecting high
frequency tooth ripples, trapezoidal in form, being illustrated in fig. 2. SORE = A SO eg S

Fia. 2. From t= 0 to t=«/o the E.M.F. rises linearly to a maximum value E,,, thence
remains constant to ¢ = (x — «)/«, and after this drops linearly to — E,, at t = (x +«)/«.
