stage these buds disappear. A less distinct but similar presence of hypodermal buds occurs
in M. lineola. The presence of such a complete series is of exceptional interest and gives
interesting leads in respect to homologies as discussed in the text. The genital buds corre-
spond to the ventral series in the other abdominal segments and to those of the thoracic legs.
On the ninth segment the dorsal buds form the paraprocts, which are considered to be in
whole tenth tergite and cerci.

(c) The genital appendages

The female flies have no genital appendages around the vulvar opening. Nevertheless,
the present study supports the view that the genital appendages in the female, when
present, rise from imaginal disks on the eighth and ninth abdominal segments. This con-
clusion is drawn from the fact that the same imaginal disks develop into evaginations which
are the rudiments of the genital appendages, as well as invaginations which are the origin
of the genital ectodermal ducts. This is exactly what happens in the case of the dipterous
males which possess copulatory apparatus. But as the females do not possess such apparatus
the imaginal disks give rise only to the genital ducts. In Chironomus and Mycetophila female
larva two separate buds are present on the eighth and ninth abdominal segments.

The true appendicular processes of the male develop from two pairs of lobes, the coxal
lobes and the paramere lobes of Singh-Pruthi. In all the cases the coxal lobes appear first,
giving rise to the gonocoxites which are constricted off distally to form the styles. In
Chironomus, where the gonocoxites are of huge size, the paramere lobes arise as detached
parts from the base of the coxal lobes. In Anisopus and Mycetophila the paramere lobes arise
