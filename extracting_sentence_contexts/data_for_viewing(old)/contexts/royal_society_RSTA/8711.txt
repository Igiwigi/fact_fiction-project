This is equal to the value of N, the coefficient of the molecular field, as we should
expect.
Similar calculations may be made for nickel and cobalt, the limiting susceptibilities
being respectively
Xt = 0°81 x 10~ for nickel,

Xt = 2'0x 10 for cobalt.

Now we may ask the question, why is it that, in spite of the fact that all the
molecules are ordered into a definite space lattice under the influence of the respective
molecular fields, the materials still show a finite susceptibility to magnetization? The

explanation, I think, is to be found in the finite though small angular oscillations
which constitute a portion of the thermal energy of the molecules. The molecules
are fixed relative to one another and form a definite space lattice but they are
