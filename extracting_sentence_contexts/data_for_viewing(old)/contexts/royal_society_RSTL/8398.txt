seems here equally inapplicable. It is for the physical astronomer to investigate the
causes of this yery striking and obviously not chance-configuration of this deformation
on the surface of our globe. [It should also be remarked that a certain order in the
form of the land (coast-lines) and sea indicates that these are not the mere result of
8uperficial actions, &xuch as deposition, denudation, and local oscillations of leyel, but

must be ascribed to forces which acted (along with these or before them) upon a
vast if not universal scale, and at far greater depths beneath the existing surface.]

53. Tt is a remarkable fact that the western coasts of nearly all the great masses of
land are the steepest, and that even without reference to littoral ranges of mountain,
such as the Andes or those of the Malabar coastÂ®*.

Now this is just what we should expect if the ocean-bed were the result of the
depression of the surface of the spheroid by the deformation supposed ; for the
matter in the erust that descended, having a velocity of rotation due to its higher
radius (that prior to depression), would, in descending to the level of the ocean-bed,
tend to fall (and by 80 mnch of the energy of its whole mass of matter to push) to the
eastward of the true vertical, just as a weight let drop from a height falls to the
eastward of the vertical. This effect would be greater as the deformation was more
rapid, but would never disappear while it occupied some finite time. [The rapidity of
elevation has at all times depended upon the rate of refrigeration ; and the latter,
