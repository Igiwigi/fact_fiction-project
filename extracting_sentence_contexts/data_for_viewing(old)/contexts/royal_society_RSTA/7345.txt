(II) Standard diving condition:

k,,, is infinite. In fact, however, k,,, always occurs with the factor cosy which is
zero. Now
ky COs nt_,

cos yk,,, = siny cot yncot ni 7 sin FG; es y = Msn yf

and as i_, > 0 so that y ~ 41, this quantity tends to the limit nk,./kp, a number like
80 or 100 for any conventional aeroplane.

kp, is, on our hypothesis, zero at i
