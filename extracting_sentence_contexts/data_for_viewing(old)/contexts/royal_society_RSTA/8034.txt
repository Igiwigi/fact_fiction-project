to steam while still in the stretched state, because of the marked side-chain re-
combination that occurs at high temperatures (see below). Other experiments were
carried out in which the relaxed fibres were placed in the steam chamber only after
they had first been caused to contract to within a few per cent. of their initial lengths
by leaving them in water at the relaxation temperature. At 64° C. the time required
for this operation varied from about 15 seconds after a relaxation time of 15 minutes
to about 2 minutes after a relaxation time of 50 minutes, so that again there is a
similar uncertainty in the effect being measured. The results, however, plotted on
the dotted curve of fig. 11 bear out the argument just given and are in close enough
relation to the rest to show that the principles involved are always essentially the
same.

As would be expected from the fact that super-contraction arises out of side-chain
modification in @-keratin, the maximum observable effect increases with the percentage
extension at which the relaxation is carried out. Fig. 13, which has been prepared
to show the relation between a number of phenomena, includes a curve showing the
increase of super-contraction in steam as the relaxation extension is increased. (For
this curve, each fibre of Cotswold wool was stretched in cold water to the extension
given by the ordinates, exposed to the action of steam for 2 minutes at this extension,
and then steamed back, with the stretching force removed, as far as it would go.) It
is remarkable how the changes in the direction of the curve correspond to those which
are found in various “ restricted ” load/extension curves, and which we have ascribed
above to the onset of the intramolecular transformation in the three elastic phases.
(The two load/extension curves given in the figure are adapted from the normal restricted
load/extension curve of Cotswold wool in water at ordinary temperatures (see fig. 3),
