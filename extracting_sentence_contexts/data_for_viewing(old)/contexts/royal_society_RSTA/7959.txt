higher carbon contents, 078% in 1392H, the increase in tenacity is comparatively small
(ratio only 1-3 to 1-4). It would thus appear that carbon to the amount of about
0-1 to 0°3% has a distinctly beneficial influence both in preventing iron from
becoming quite brittle in liquid air and in increasing its effect on the tenacity, but
the effect falls off with a higher carbon content.

This conclusion is now borne out and amplified by the results obtained at the still
lower temperature of liquid hydrogen. While these low carbon steels have, under the
influence of the severe conditions in liquid hydrogen, been unable to retain any further
modicum of their ductility, their favourable behaviour is maintained to the extent that
they continue to increase in tenacity with this further lowering of the temperature.
The already specially high ratio of increase, 2-65, of 1166A/4 steel (0-14% C.) in liquid
air is, in fact, carried to 3-23, the original tenacity of 21-4 tons per square inch becoming
69-2 tons. Although many other materials in the present research show a larger
tenacity, none shows such a large relative increase as compared with ordinary tempera-
ture. With the higher carbon content, 0-37% in 1397A, the same kind of behaviour
is exhibited in lesser degree, the carbon percentage being apparently rather too high
for the best results.

Even an addition of 1-04°% manganese in steel No. 4147 /104 (C 0+24%), Group II,
Class 16, although harmful, does not appear to remove these characteristics entirely.
In this specimen the ratio of increase in tenacity is only moderate, 1-69, but it still
retains the characteristic of iron in not suffering any further reduction between liquid
air and liquid hydrogen and, as mentioned earlier, retains some ductility in liquid air.
