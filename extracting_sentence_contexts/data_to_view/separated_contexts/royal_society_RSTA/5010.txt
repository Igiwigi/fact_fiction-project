At 0° C, it has the
value 0:0007, at 50° C. the value 0°0004, and at 90° C. 0:0003. Again, if we evaluate the variable term in the case of the density being 0°0800—
the second equi-density line on the plate—it is found that the sensibly rectilinear
plotting of the experiments is in agreement with theory. The fall in the specific heat
between about 10° and 100° C. calculates, in fact, to be 0°00103. This is a far wider
range than the range of mean temperatures in the experiments. The experiments did
not cover more than half this range, and must have been competent to show a varia-
tion of one part in 2000 upon values of @ lying between 0°223 and 0:054 grammes.
