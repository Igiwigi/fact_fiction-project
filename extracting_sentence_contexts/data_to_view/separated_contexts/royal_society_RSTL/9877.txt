much resembles that of the Tortoise (see Plate 95, fig. 105). In the medulla there are
a few concentric corpuscles formed of epithelioid cells. In the thymus there is a follicle composed entirely of flattened, spindle-shaped cells;
this exactly resembles those which are met with in the Tortoise, and which have been
snpposed by AFANASSIEW (33) to be individual follicles, undergoing involution before
the res of the gland ; there is no evidence that this is the case ; on the contrary, all
the facts point to its being some other gland which is situated among the thymic
follicles. As in the first place, it is found in quite young Reptiles, as in the small
Tortoise and the young Alligator; and in Mammals and the other classes of Vertebrates
we do not find individual follicles undergoing involution before the rest of the gland. Secondly, when a follicle undergoes involution the process is a yery gradual one, and is
never characterised by a change of the whole follicle, equally and everywhere, into one
tissxue, Thirdly, these follicles are composed everywhere of flattened, spindle-shaped
cells, and no such tissue is met with in the undoubted thymic follicles of either old or
young Reptiles.
