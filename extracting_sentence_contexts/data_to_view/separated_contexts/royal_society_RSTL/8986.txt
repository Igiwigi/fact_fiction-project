If we proceed to deal with
this equation with the same freedom as with a numerical equation, and to multiply each
member of this equation, not by a numerical symbol 2 (which is permissible), but by a

chemical symbol v, we have
MO = CEA OY oa fs fas a, - © i. =. (9)

a conclusion which is obviously false; for, interpreting the equation consistently with
the principles on which these symbols are constructed, we are informed by it that the
unit, of matter 8ymbolized as vzy is identical, as regards © weight” or matter, with the
aggregate of the two units symbolized as vw and vy ; and further, if we apply to equa-
tion (2) the principle laid down in equation (1), we have vzy=v+ay, vx=v+7r, vy=v+y,
and, as a final conclusion, v=2v, Again, taking the equation a%=x+xy, which is true,
dividing both members of the equation by the chemical symbol &, we are led to an
absurd conclusion, namely, that

that is to say, that the matter symbolized as xy is always identical with the matter of
an empty unit of space, symbolized as 1, and the matter symbolized as y. But it is only
necessary to observe that the equations (2) and (3) to which we are thus led,

vay=vx+vy,
acy=1+y,

are not chemical equations at all, for they do not satisfy the fundamental conditions
afforded by the system of indeterminate equations previously referred to,
mp+mq+m"r+...0,

In $hort, if we inconsiderately deal with these equations without reference to the
principles on which they have been constructed, precisely as though they were numerical
equations, we are not only involved in a tissue- of absurdities and contradictions, but are
compelled to introduce into the system of chemical equations, equations which do not
belong to that system at all, and which could neyer arise from the expression by means
of equations of chemical facts,


66 SIR B. C. BRODIE ON THE CALCULUS. OF CHEMICAL OPERATIONS. It is impossible for a false or absurd result to be the consequence of the application
to a true statement of a correct principle of reasoning ; and we are thus led to the sin-
gular conclusion that, although up to a certain point the analogy is perfect between
the properties of chemical and numerical symbols, here this analogy terminates and
ceases to be a correct guide ; and we are apparently forced to admit that in the treat-
ment of chemical equations no processes exist equivalent to the algebraical processes of
multiplication and division.
