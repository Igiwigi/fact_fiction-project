Seven of the ten I have mentioned
are not perfectly round, but a very little elliptical. Ought we
not to ascribe this figure tothe same cause which has flattened
the polardiameter of the planets, namely, a rotatory motion? At the end of the 26th article I have already pointed out
one configuration of the nebulous matter, of which the final
condensation seems to be properly disposed for bringing on a
rotatory motion of the nucleus ; but, if we consider this matter
in a general light, it appears' that every figure which is not
already globular must have eccentric nebulous matter, which
in- its endeavour to! come to the center, will either dislodge
some of the nebulosity which is already deposited, or slide upon
it sideways, and in both'cases produce a circular motion ; $0
that'in fact we can hardly suppose a possibility of the produc-
tion of a' globular form without a consequent revolution of the
nebulous matter, which'in the end may settle in a regular ro=
tation! about some fixed axis. Many of the extended, and
irregular nebulz are considerably elliptical, and the irregular

round ones shew a general approach to the oval form; now
these figures are all favourable to a surmise, that a rotatory
' motion .may often take place even before the nucleus of a
nebula can have arrived to a state of consolidation.
