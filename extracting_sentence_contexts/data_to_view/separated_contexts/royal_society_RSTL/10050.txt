SrcorroN 1.—INTRODUCTORY. Tar general anatomy of the adult Lucifer has been satisfactorily made known by
the observations of SouLEyYer, HuxLey, Hexsen, DANA, SeMPeR, CLAUs, DonRN, and
FaxoxN ; and the only facts which I have to add relate to the structure of the
reproductive organs. The earliest recorded observations upon this 8ubject are by DaxAa (* United States
Exploring Expedition during the Years 1838, 1839, 1840, 1841, and 1842,” under the
Command of CrarLes Wirkrs, U.S.N., vol. xiii., part 1). In plate 44, fig. 9, b, h, and
1”, he gives a very correct representation of the male reproductive organs and sperma-
tophore of an adult male specimen of Lucifer (acestra) ; but his description of these
figures (p. 670) shows that he was completely at a loss for an interpretation of the
parts which he has represented, and had no idea of their true function.
