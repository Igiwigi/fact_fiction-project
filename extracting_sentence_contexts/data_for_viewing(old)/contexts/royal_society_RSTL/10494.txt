it can withstand without igniting when a spark is passed through it.

2. The addition of a trace of aqueous vapour to the non-inflammable mixture
causes it to become inflammable, all other conditions remaining the same.

3, The addition of a trace of hydrogen or of a volatile body containing hydrogen
causes the dry mixture to become inflammable, all other conditions remaining the
Same.

4. The rapidity of explosion of the mixture in a tube one metre long is greater
with a large quantity of aqueous vapour than when only a trace is present.

These well-established facts, coupled with the fact that carbonic oxide does de-
Z compose steam at a high temperature, appear to me to show conclusively that in
5 the ordinary explosion of carbonic oxide and oxygen, the union is not a direct one,
E but is effected indirectly by the agency of hydrogen.

In a paper on the alkaline peroxides,* the late Sir B. BroDIE has thus described
8uch an indirect action :—*© The alkaline peroxides have a double function, and can
be used as agents either of oxidation or of reduction. By certain modifications
: of the conditions of the experiment, we can produce separately either result. It is
not unreasonable to suppose that, among the numerous and varied forms of chemical
decomposition, instances would be found in which these phenomena would occur
simultaneously. If this were to be the case the result would be what is termed
a contact or catalytic decomposition, but caused by two successive changes of a
