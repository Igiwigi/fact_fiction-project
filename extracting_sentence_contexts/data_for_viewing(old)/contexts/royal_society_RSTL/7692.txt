(2x1, 1 - /) is equal to the order of this residual curve, that is, it is =6.

If the conic touch a second arbitrary line e/z+þB'y+yz2=0, then we have in like
manner the quadric surface

(0, —4@&, $(464—3e&), $ac, —Zab, O0Xe', B, y)*=0;

that is, we have the quartic torse and two quadric surfaces, each passing through the
conic a=0, 4b4—3&=0, and it is to be shown that the number of intersections not on
this conic is =5. The two quadric surfaces intersect in the conic and in a second
conic; this second conic meets the torse in $ points, but 2 of these coincide with the
point, a=0, 5=0, c=0, which is one of the intersections of the two conics (the point a=0,
þ=0, e=0 is in fact a point on the cuspidal edge of the torse, and, the conic passing
through it, reckons for 2 intersections), and 1 of the 8 points coincides with the other of
the intersections of the two conics ; there remain therefore 8—2—1, =5 intersections, or

we have (2z1, 1//)=5.
Annex No. 5 (referred to, Nos. 22 and 71).—On the Conics which have contact of the third
order with a given cuspidal cubic, and two contacts (doudle contact) with a given conic.

Let, the equation of the cuspidal cubic be a2%—z*=0 (z=0 tangent at cusp, z=0
tangent at, inflexion, y=0 line joining cusp and inflexion ; equation satisfied by

and let the equation of the given conic be
