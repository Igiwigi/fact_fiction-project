view is based seems sufficiently strong, undoubted exceptions occur which, if they are not
enough to invalidate the hypothesis as a whole, indicate that we should regard it as a
general approximation. Additional support for the general thesis has, however, been pro-
vided by the discovery first of all that various derivatives of 4-aminostilbene possess such
inhibitory properties par excellence, and only later that these compounds are in fact endowed
with carcinogenic properties; if no proof can be claimed, the correlation would seem to be
more than one of chance alone.
Another biological association which receives considerable support fromâ€™ the present
results is that between carcinogenicity and the property of inducing the formation of
haemolymph nodes in the rat. The spontaneous occurrence of haemolymph nodes in this
species had been described by earlier workers (e.g. Vincent & Harrison 1897; Drummond
1900; Lewis 1903; Macmillan 1928), attention being drawn especially to two such nodes in
the vicinity of the kidneys. Following observations on rats treated with carcinogenic tar
(Lasnitzki 1938), Lasnitzki & Woodhouse (1942) described the transformation of normal
lymph nodes into haemolymph nodes in the rat by treatment with 1:2:5:6-dibenzan-
thracene. The appearance is that of a red discoloration commencing on the surface of the
nodes, varying in extent and degree, which is to be found in all regions of the body but is
