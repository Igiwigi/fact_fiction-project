Photographic impressions, therefore,
taken on this paper, though very pretty, are exceedingly tedious in their preparation,
if we would have the lights sharply made out.

194. The residual tint thus outstanding, after long exposure, is turned, not green,
but yellow, by alkalies; or, if greenish at first, a very few hours suffice for the destruc-
tion of the slight remnant of blue, and the consequent appearance of the yellow co-
lour. Reasoning on this fact, as well as on the action of light above mentioned, it
seems highly probable that the tincture in question holds in solution two distinet
colouring principles, of which the one (greatly preponderant in quantity) is destruc-
tible by light, and either destroyed or turned green by alkalies; the other, indestruc-
tible by light, and either naturally yellow in colour or changeable into yellow by al-
kaline agency. 195. This view of the composite nature of the colour in question receives corrobo-
ration from the habitudes of the alcoholic tincture above mentioned, when rendered
green by admixture of carbonate of soda.
