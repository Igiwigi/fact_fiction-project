REFRACTION AND DISPERSION OF THE HALOGENS, HALOGEN ACIDS, ETC. 3

and confirmed by experiment. But it is desirable to emphasise the fact that the
calculation of the constants given in this paper from a formula containing only one
term on the right-hand side is only provisional, since the main conclusion of the
authors is that, both for elements and compounds, a single term is inadequate, except
in the case of monatomic gases. The simple form of the formula is, however, useful
for indicating at a glance the direction and magnitude of the changes in refractive
and dispersive power which take place when elements combine to form a compound. If 4; wy are the refractive indices of a substance for two wave-lengths for which the
frequencies are 7, 7, We have
