As follows from the proof of theorem 2.2, no explicit form of the fixed-point operator is needed
for the solvability of (2.1). A key point for the unique solvability of (2.2) in theorem 2.2 is the choice
of the map G. To this aim, in our opinion, the best cases are the following two, namely

(4) G(t,q,x) = 81,9), (iz) G01, g, x) = 81, 9) Â® (Xn41)-

In the case (iz), the equation in (2.2) is a half-linear equation and in this situation a very large
variety of results is known, see e.g. [2, ch. VIII]. An application in this direction is in [10, Section 4].

In the case (i1), that is when the function G does not depend on x and the equation in (2.2)
is affine, theorem 2.2 can be particularly useful to solve BVPs associated to difference equations
with deviating arguments. Indeed, in this case, it can lead to a BVP associated with a second-order
difference equation without deviating argument. An application of this fact is in the following
section.

3. Proof of theorem 1.2

For proving theorem 1.2, the following auxiliary result is needed.

Lemma 3.1. Assume (1.1) and (1.4). Let x be an eventually positive decreasing solution of (P) such
that limy Xp = 0. Then the series
