initial genomic distribution, is free from local optima. In many known cases [26], the fitness was
seen to return to its original value but with a different genome indicative of a level set at the
top of the landscape, as shown in figure 2. Beyond such laboratory experiments lies the most


stark evidence—that complex organisms exist. The period of time taken for the appearance of
bacteria, and beyond to higher forms of life, as only a few billion years, is very short given their
inherent complexity and the required multitude of elaborate evolutionary steps. These findings,
particularly the latter, have left a puzzle especially considering that intuition would suggest that
evolutionary landscapes with approximately 10° nucleic acid sites would be very rugged.

The evidence in the scientific domains of quantum mechanics, chemistry and material science,
and evolution exists in a vast body of the literature, which must be taken as foundational facts to
be reconciled, perhaps individually in each domain, or more enticingly in a sweeping consistent
manner as indicated in the second portion of table 1 and the remainder of this paper. The details
in treating the evidence differ in swinging between domains, but the analyses are similar, which
eventually leads to conjecturing that the scope of observed landscape behaviour extends to the
general structure of equation (1.1) upon satisfaction of three assumptions, enumerated in the :
