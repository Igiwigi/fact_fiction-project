laries by innumerable ayenues. But towards the Malpighian bodies, there is no
opening from this capillary network at all corresponding in magnitude or freedom to
that on the side of the veins. In fact, the only points by which it can discharge
itself are the efferent vessels of the Malpighian bodies, which are comparatively few
in number, only capillary in size, and quite disconnected with one another, except
through the plexus itself. Add to this, that the Malpighian tuft to which they lead
is a great obstacle to the passage of fluid, from the tortuosity of its minute vessels,
and by their all having but one point to discharge themselves of the blood they
already contain, viz. their afferent vessel. Thus to fluid driven through the kidney
in a retrograde course, there is not only the general impediment offered by the
aggregate capacity of the arteries being greatly inferior to that of the veins, but a
yascular arrangement equivalent to a double valve.
