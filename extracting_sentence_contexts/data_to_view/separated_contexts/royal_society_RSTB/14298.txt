Here, we have reviewed
evidence that allows us to make two claims: first, social inter-
action is an integral part of human learning. Second, learning
in social (and interactive) contexts engages partially different
mechanisms from learning in non-social (and non-interactive)
contexts. Social interaction in fact employs a series of processes
unique to interactive situations, including (but not limited to)
joint attention, reciprocity and active attunement, that may be
key to support learning in humans. Inconclusion, we presented studies to show the role of social
interaction in the first years of life for optimal cognitive and
brain development, and demonstrate that social interaction
boosts learning in adulthood too. We reported studies that
have specifically looked at complex real-world learning (e.g.
from object features in children to complex medical curricula
in adults) and placed learning in its ecology: these have included
social interaction at the different stages of the experimental pro-
cess to fully grasp the multifaceted mechanisms of interactive
learning, and we have discussed their evidence in relation to
less comprehensive approaches.
