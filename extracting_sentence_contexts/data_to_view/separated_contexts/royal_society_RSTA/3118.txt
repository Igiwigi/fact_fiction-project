There is unquestionably a well-marked
minimum near midsummer. There seems also to be a second minimum in January,
but whether this would be shown—or if shown would be as prominent—if we had
70 years instead of 7 is open to doubt. The fact that the largest mean monthly
value did not occur in January in any one of the seven years, whilst occurring
four times in December, is so far confirmatory. In November, December, and
January, however, fog is a very uncertain while very important influence. During
thick fog in winter P is usually abnormally high, 400 to 600 volts—or practically
double the ordinary gradient—being not infrequently met with.
