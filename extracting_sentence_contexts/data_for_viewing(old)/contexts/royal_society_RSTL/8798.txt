cases, after the addition of dilute acetic acid. The method of hardening and cutting
sections was not applied by me to the study of the deposited eggs of Loligo, which, on
account of their great transparency, offer every facility for study in the fresh state with
even the highest powers* ; but the growth of the ovarian egg and its envelopes or
preseminary deyelopmentF has. been followed by means of sections stained with car-
mine, cut from eggs hardened in absolute alcohol, and some in chromic acid, in the
usual way.

Tye OVARIAN OVUM.

The ovary of Sepia and of Loligo at the breeding-time is an arborescent organ,
formed by a series of branches and twigs, on the ends of which the eggs are een like
$0 many grapes on a bunch, but differing from a grape-bunch in the fact that the eggs
are of yery various sizes (Plate 11. fig. 13). I do not propose here to go into the larger
anatomical features of the ovary, but to confine myself to the history of the growth of
the individual eggs as exhibited in the yariously sized specimens which occur in one
and the same adult ovary. This, accordingly, excludes all question of the earlier
deyelopment of the ovary and the ultimate origin of its constituent cells, a matter which
must be treated of in due course in connexion with the later embryonic history of the
deyeloping Cephalopod.

Limits of size of the Ovarian Egg in Sepia, â€”The observations which follow, unless
the contrary is stated, must be understood as relating to Sepia. The preparations to
which they refer, some of which are represented in Plates 11, 12, were made in the
histological laboratory of Exeter College during the present year (1873). 'The ovarian
