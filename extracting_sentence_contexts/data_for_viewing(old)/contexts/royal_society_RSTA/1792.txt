(3.4)

An optimal choice for the number of terms n in the summation of (3.3) is 10 <n < 14, here
we are using 14. Note that (3.4) is incorrectly written in [18], which can be attributed to the fact
that the same expression is also incorrectly written in [11] from which it was taken. The Stehfest
algorithm gives very good results in the short-time domain. In §4 we will study its reliable use by
comparing its results with the universal numerical method.

(c) Pole extraction

The residue theorem is an alternative method for Laplace inversion and involves the computation
of poles of the function to be inverted. The method is ideal for the so called ‘long-time’ calculation
since in this case only a few poles need to be found for the accurate description of the transient
signal. The diffusive nature of the eddy current phenomenon implies that all poles are real, thus
leading to distinct decay modes for the acquired signal. Suitable methods are used for bracketing
the poles prior to their exact calculation, following in part the method developed in [14]. A similar
