A protostelic shoot has now been obtained by making incisions very
close to the apical cell. The small shoot later became attenuated, the apical meristem
became parenchymatous, and the vascular system faded out. Facts of this kind, as also
abundant data relating to the vascular tissue in isolated apical meristems and induced
buds, support the writerâ€™s. hypothesis that the initial differentiation of the vascular system
is due to the downward movement of a substance or substances from an actively growing
apical meristem (Wardlaw 1944a). To what extent the apical cell in particular is responsible
for this process is a matter for further investigation. The only vascular tissue present in an isolated terminal region lies immediately below
the active apical meristem, or in the new shoot which results from its growth.
