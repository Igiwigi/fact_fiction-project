Even in the case of an infinite field, it
cannot be more than double that due to a field of 272 units if the motion is only just
dead beat. From this it appears that, as long as the circuit has dimensions which at
all approximate to those which theoretically are best, the sensibility obtained by
moving the pole pieces until the dead beat conditions or the desired logarithmic
decrement are produced is practically the highest which is possible. MDCCCLXXXIX.â€”A. 2A

Owing to the fact that, with increase in the breadth of the circuit, the cross piece
becomes increasingly mischievous, both on account of its moment of inertia and of its
resistance, it is clear that the circuit cannot be too narrow until the increased length
becomes such that it is inconvenient to provide a magnet and pole pieces which will
enclose so great a length. In another way the thick wire which the narrow circuit
requires is advantageous, as will appear shortly. Having thus found the best relations between the variable copper and the arbitrary
junction and mirror, it remains to see how these may be modified with advantage.
