Random K-SAT corresponds to an extension of the SK model with spins
interacting in a combination of terms of the form Gin, ++ +5 Fi, where 1<p<
K and the i are chosen from 1,...,N; this yields a graph structure that
is a ‘cactus’ extension of the random graphs of Erdés & Rényi (1960).'°
Already, therefore, one can expect analogous glassy effects in an attempt to
solve the random K-SAT problem using a computer algorithm based on local
operations. In fact, however, the p-spin version of the SK model exhibits further
interesting behaviour beyond the p=2 SK original. In particular, there are
several transitions as the temperature of this p-spin model is reduced. Two
of these are thermodynamic; the higher, at Te , is to a state known as ‘one-
step replica symmetry broken’ (1RSB), corresponding to the onset of many
non-equivalent macrostates {5} that are mutually orthogonal (Parisi 1980),
followed by a lower temperature transition, at Ta , to ‘full replica symmetry
oreaking’ (FRSB) (Gardner 1985), at which the non-equivalent macrostates star
o acquire a continuous range of overlaps (as characterizes the SK spin-glass
phase). These transitions are, however, pre-empted by a dynamical transition a
a higher temperature, Tp, again to 1RSB. The fact that Tp > Te means tha
he system becomes glassy before the thermodynamic limit for paramagnetism
is reached.
