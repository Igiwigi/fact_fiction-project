Posteriorly, each
Trigeminus plate is separated by a short interval from a tolerably massive
longitudinal thickening of the neural crest which continues backwards in the
posterior cephalic region, This is the continuous Anlage of the ganglia of the
Acustico-facialis, Glossopharyngeus and Vagus nerves, undifferentiated as yet into
its individual components. It will be observed that the cranial extremity of this
Anlage is separated by only a very slight interval from the caudal end of the
Trigeminus lobe. In several embryos of practically the same stage we can, in fact,
recognise a slender, but distinct, longitudinal commissural connection between these
two great ganglionic Anlagen. On the other hand, in a slightly later stage, a break
of continuity occurs between the Acustico-facial and the Glossopharyngeal portions
of the neural crest, introducing the condition which we have seen to obtain in the
Ornithorhynchus stage above described. In the Dasyurus embryo shown in fig. 78 two very distinct neuromeres are
perceptible.
