206 LINES OF MAGNETIC DECLINATION IN THE ATLANTIC.

branches of which form the limits of the four great systems of is0gonic lines, viz. of
the four great systems which prevail respectively in the N.W., N.E., S.W. and S.E.
directions, and have one isogonic line common to them all, the branches of which
meet at a common point of junction or intersection near the west coast of Africa,
and not far from the terrestrial equator, The theoretical value of this line is 22% 13'W.;
whereas its true value is certainly not more than between 19? and 209, and it appears
to have been in the year 1840 nearly midway between those values. Had the theo-
retical value been in defect instead of in excess, the difference might have been
ascribed to an effect of secular change; in which case M. Gavuss's map might be
supposed to represent an earlier state of the phenomena than that of the year 1840.
But the fact is otherwise ; the theoretical value of the line in question is in excess,
although its actual value has been progressiyely increasing since the earliest record
of the phenomena, and was greater in 1848 than in any antecedent year since the
phenomena have been observed. 'The theoretical error is the more remarkable
because Mr. BarLow's map for 1833, which was the one employed by M. Gauss for
the declination, gives the value of that element correctly at 20* or thereabouts, at
the spot where M. Gauss's theoretical line of 22* 13' cuts the coast of Africa.

The form of the lines in Mr. BarLow's map in that quarter of the globe is indeed
not correct, since on no part of the surface of the earth do the magnetic lines fork in
the manner there represented, and which is very different from the intersection of
lines of equal value forming four branches of one and the same isogonic line, which
is the character of the remarkable line now referred to; but the value of the declina-
