The RuS,W compound Cp*WO(u-S)2Ru(PPh3)2Cl cleaves Hz in the presence
of the halide abstractor NaBAr'4 (Arf = 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl) (scheme 11); no reaction
is observed with only Hz or only NaBAr', [30]. The terminal oxo on tungsten is protonated,
and the ruthenium receives the hydride. The mechanism for this process is not clear, and is
complicated by the fact that the hydrogen atoms from H) are trans in the product. The authors
propose two possible pathways: an intermolecular pathway where the H2 adduct is deprotonated
by the terminal oxo on a second molecule, and an intramolecular pathway in which Hz adds
across the Ru-S bond and the resultant bridging hydrosulfide is intramolecularly deprotonated
by the terminal oxo. Another bimetallic sulfido complex reported by Tatsumi and co-workers that heterolytically
cleaves Hz features a GeRu centre.
