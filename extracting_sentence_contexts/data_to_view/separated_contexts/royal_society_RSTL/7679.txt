But these values give I, M, N=12, 12, —16; yalues which
satisfy the equations T?—12uw*M=0, LM+9w'N=0, AM*+3LN=0, and as the points
in question are obviously not on the line y=0, w=0, they lie on the ninthic component
of the cuspidal curve, being in fact points B', and not pinch-points. The line y=0, w=0 gue nodal line would have every point a pinch-point, but being
part of the cuspidal curve, no point thereof is regarded as a pinch-point ; that is, in
regard to this line also we have J=0. And therefore for the entire nodal curve j/=0.

115. 'The cuspidal ninthic curve is a unicursal curve, the equations of which can be
very readily obtained by considering it as the reciprocal of the spinode torse; we 1

or substituting for X, Y, Z, W their values (=166, 40+16#, 169%, —5 —88—166") and
omitting a common factor 169, we find for the cuspidal curve
@: 9:2: w=30+246 —168 : 248+ 328 : —4—488#: 169%
(values which verify the equation X>+Yy+Zz+Ww=0); the spinode curve being
thus of the order=9 as mentioned. For {=o we have the singular point (y=0, z=0, w=0), (reciprocal of torsal biplane),
and in the vicinity thereof @: y : 2: w=l: — 26-3: 36-*: —675, therefore

= For 6=0 we have the singular point #z=0, y=0, w=0 (reciprocal of the other

Sbiplane), and in the vicinity thereof @: y: 2: w=—$0: —60: 1: —48, therefore
