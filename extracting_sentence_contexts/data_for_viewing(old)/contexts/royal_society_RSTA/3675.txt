increased steel prices, and explores different situations in which such pass through
may be inefficient. Of the arguments considered, compensation mechanisms that seek
to address the risk of carbon leakage are likely to act as the greatest hindrance to material
demand reduction: unless upstream companies are encouraged to make windfall profits
from these types of schemes, downstream incentives for reducing demand for embodied
emissions intensive materials will be weakened. This paper explains how the difficulties
in implementing a global carbon price described by Victor [67] can to some extent be
overcome through unilateral action coupled with compensation schemes but translate
into weaker incentives for material demand reduction.

— Kallis [57] makes a different challenge to the current application of economics in
driving government policy by observing that what economists frequently describe as
‘externalities’ are in fact cost-shifting successes. In contrast with the theoretical ideal of
a free market, Kallis quoting Kapp [69] notes how different players in a democracy have
different power to exert influence over policy and hence the economists’ ‘externalities’
are not absolute functions of the neo-classical model, but a result of power-play and
