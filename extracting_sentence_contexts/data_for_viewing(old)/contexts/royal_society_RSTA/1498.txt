where z is the observed quantity and o; is its observational error (as a standard deviation) and og D8
is the model discrepancy, described below. We can then ‘rule out’ points that are many standard Dw
deviations from the mean as being implausible given the observation and all sources of error. :
As noted above, there are three types of uncertainty that we need to account for when :s
computing implausibility: :s

I(x*) =

(i) Observational error, which is uncertainty in the observed value itself;
(ii) Uncertainty in the approximate model, which reflects the fact that we cannot query the
full computational model at all points; and
(iii) Model discrepancy, which is uncertainty about the model itself, and measures how well
the computational model represents reality.

In practice, (i) and (ii) are straightforward to determine, while (iii) is much trickier [19].
However, studies have shown that not accounting for model discrepancy leads to overconfident
predictions, so this is essential to consider to give a thorough UQ treatment to a computational
model. However, estimating model uncertainty is in itself a difficult (and often subjective) task,
and is beyond the scope of this tutorial, as it requires knowledge about the approximations
made in the simulation. Thus, we will restrict ourselves to only accounting for uncertainty in the
approximate model in this tutorial, but note that realistic UQ assessments require careful scrutiny
and awareness of the limitations of computational models.
