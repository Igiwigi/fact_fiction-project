they all showed mycorhiza, it does not follow that general reduction would be the
consequence ; a very large number of plants having mycorhiza show no sign of
reduction. Further, if reduction did take place, as has been pointed out in
connection with the Psilotacese, it would primarily affect the vegetative organs,
whose functions would thus be disturbed; but it would probably not alter the
sporangial conditions, except as a secondary consequence, in case the mycorhiza-
nutrition were less effective than the original autotrophic method. How little the
occurrence of mycorhiza may be found to affect the morphological characters of
Pteridophytes is shown in the Marattiaces. According to KirHn|| the fungus is
found in the roots of Kaulfussia, of Angiopteris, and of Marattia alata, but not in
those of Marattia fraxinea ; but no reduction is to be noted as the result in the
former Ferns as compared with the latter. Again, Cyathea is stated to have
mycorhiza, while Aspleniwnu nidus has not.{ Such facts as these make me think
that it cannot be justly assumed that the mycorhizic habit in the Ophioglossacez has
been a source of general reduction in the family. The argument in favour of their
being a reduction series will have to be based on other evidence.

Pending the statement of that evidence, I may say that the view of them as an
ascending series appears to me the more probable.** Some grounds for this are as
follows: they are not nearly allied in characters to any living Ferns; they are
homosporous, and share the general advantage among homosporous forms of an
