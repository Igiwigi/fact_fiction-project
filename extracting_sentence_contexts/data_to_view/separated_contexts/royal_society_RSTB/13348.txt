As noted in §2, the actual factor claimed to be driving the
increase of obligatory TAM marking is rapid demographic expansion
and associated rise in socio-political complexity; such events
obviously occurred, in different parts of the world, at different
times and are therefore reflected in contemporary genealogical
groupings of varying time depths.

'” As observed in Gil & Shen [29], one of the other factors affecting the
degree of grammaticalization of thematic-role assignment is polity
complexity; as mentioned in §1, this provides further support for
the Complexity Covariance Hypothesis. In particular, in accordance
with this correlation, national languages tend to exhibit higher gram-
maticalization of thematic-role assignment than regional ones. Accordingly, the difference between Nage and Palauan also reflects
the fact that the former is a regional language while the latter is a
national language. Stronger evidence for the correlation between
TAM marking and grammaticalization of thematic roles is provided,
in the Association Experiment, by various minimal pairs of
languages resembling each other in most other respects, including
polity complexity, while differing with respect to TAM marking. One such minimal pair is provided by two regional Philippine
languages, Kapampangan, with obligatory TAM marking and
higher grammaticalization of thematic-role assignment, versus Ilo-
kano, with optional TAM marking and lower grammaticalization of
thematic-role assignment; another is presented by two Mayan
languages, Tz’utujil, with obligatory TAM marking and higher gram-
maticalization of thematic-role assignment, versus Q’anjob’al, with
optional TAM marking and lower grammaticalization of thematic-
role assignment.
