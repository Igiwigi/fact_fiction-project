the portal vein, and as it is necessary to distinguish this form from that com-
mencing in the portal vein, the term of hepatic-yenous congestion will not pro-
bably be deemed inapplicable to it. Portal-yvenous congestion is of very rare
occurrence ; I have een it in children only. In this form, the congested sub-
stance never assumes the deep red colour which characterizes hepatic-yenous
congestion ; the interlobular fissures and spaces and the marginal portions of
the lobules are of a deeper colour than usual; the congested substance is con-
tinuous and cortical, the non-congested substance being medullary and occu-
pying the centres of the lobules. (Plate XXI. fig. 4.) The second stage of
hepatic-yenous congestion, in which the congested substance appears, but is
not, cortical, may be easily confounded with portal-venous congestion.

The physiological deductions arising out of the preceding anatomical facts
are extremely simple. If it could be shown that two substances exist in the
liver, it might be fairly presumed that this organ executes two functions ; but
each lobule being, in itself, a perfect gland, and of the same structure through-
