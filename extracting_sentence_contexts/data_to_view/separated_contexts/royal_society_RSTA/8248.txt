Thus ‘Y-conics in
general meet ¢’‘ in three points and Q in two points. Similarly we find that to any
line of S through P there corresponds a trisecant line of $’,* ; and to any line meeting c,
there corresponds a line meeting $’,4 and Q. From these facts we deduce the follow-
ing: To any V3" of &, containing $’ as r-fold and Qas s-fold surfaces, corresponds a
Vs™-*—* of 8, having cy as (n — 2r — s)-fold curve and P as (n — 2s)-fold point. We finish with four examples of the use of this theorem :—

x. s. Cubic primals through ¢’ -+ Cubic cones with fixed vertex at P, and passing through
C4.
