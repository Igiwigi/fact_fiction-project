even mode mixing. These results conclusively showed that, while the observed field appears to
be a Laguerre-Gaussian azimuthal mode, it was in fact not; rather, its field was that described
by equation (2.5). This raises questions about some statements in the literature claiming OAM
generation from lasers based only on intensity measurements but without confirmation of the
azimuthal phase (see for example [47,49-51]).

(c) Generalized Poincaré sphere beams

The previous sections have described scalar OAM modes, yet it is known that OAM vector and
scalar modes may be described on the same abstract sphere, the high-order Poincaré sphere [52]
for the total angular momentum of light, analogous to the Poincaré sphere for polarization and
the Bloch sphere for OAM [53]. In this abstract space, the poles represent scalar OAM modes
of opposite helicity, the equator describes the cylindrical vector beams [54] and any arbitrary
position on the sphere describes some superposition with a degree of ‘vectorness’ that varies
from purely scalar to purely vector [55].
