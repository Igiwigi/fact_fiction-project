well adapted for the performance. of a special function, that it hardly seems safe to
regard them as slightly modified gills until there are more careful observations on
the habits of other forms. I recognise fully the mass of evidence in favour of the
primitive form of the plate-like gill, My only plea is for caution.‚Äù

It is true that the gill with leaflets may have been evolved from a simple fili-
branchiate gill without ciliated dises or interfilamentar fusions, on the assumption
that each filament has an extensive interlamellar septum, and that the vertical extent
of the demibranch has become reduced. But, after all, the Protobranch ctenidium
conforms more nearly with that of the Gastropod and Cephalopod than does the

Filibranch, and it is thus more reasonable to consider it as the more primitive form.
The fact that the other anatomical features of these Protobranch Molluses, as well as
their antiquity in geological time, point to their primitive nature must be allowed to
carry weight. The ablest arguments put forward in favour of the archaic character
of the Protobranch gill are those published by PeLsenzer in 1891 (71, pp. 246-250,
and p. 274). He has shown (71, figs. 99, 100, and 103) how closely the gill-structure
of the Protobranchia resembles that of Fissurella, Chitonellus (= Cryptoplax), and
Trochus. It is, further, not a little remarkable how closely the figure of the section
