Methods for inferrin g influence of the group, and being followed by a set number or percentage
of group members within a defined time-frame. This approach
has the advantage that it is often possible to carry out from
direct observations in the field, as well as from fine-scale move-
ment data, and it has been widely applied because of oura priori
belief that such initiations of group departures are important in
determining group movements. The fact that such initiations
are observed across a variety of taxa also speaks to the wide
applicability of this approach. A recent generalization of this method applied the concept
of initiators and followers to infer influence at the individual-to-
individual level in a troop of wild baboons, and developed
an algorithm to automatically extract such interactions [59]. Here, sequences of movement are extracted in which one indi-
vidual moved away from another and either was followed
(characterized as a ‘successful pull’) or was not followed and
subsequently returned (characterized as a ‘failed pull’).
