It will be seen that in the present memoir, the geometry of one dimension is
E treated of as a geometry of points in a line, and the geometry of two dimensions as a
= geometry of points and lines in a plane. It is, however, to be throughout borne in
£2 mind, that, in accordance with the remarks No. 4 of the Introductory Memoir, the terms
= employed are not (unless this is done expressly or by the context) restricted to their
= ordinary significations. In using the geometry of one dimension in reference to geometry
+ of two dimensions considered as a geometry of points and lines in a plane, it is necessary
S to consider,—1?, that the word point may mean point and the word line mean line;
E 2*, that the word point may mean line and the word line mean point, It is, T say,
& necessary to do this, for in 8uch geometry of two dimensions we have systems of points
in a line and of lines through a point, and each of these systems is in fact a system
belonging to, and which can by such extended signification of the terms be included in,
the geometry of one dimension. And precisely because we can by such extension com-
prise the correlative theorems under a common enunciation, it is not in the geometry of
one dimension necessary to enunciate them separately ; it may be and very frequently is
necessary and proper in the geometry of two dimensions, where we are concerned with
systems of each kind, to enunciate 8uch correlative theorems separately. It may, by
way of further illustration, be remarked, that in using the geometry of one dimension

in reference to geometry of three dimensions considered as a geometry of points, lines,
