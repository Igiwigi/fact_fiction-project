Now, considering this graph, we see nine different paths from f to zero. Nevertheless, we
realize quite easily that some paths are essentially the same. In fact, whenever we have a polynomial to which we can apply the rewriting rules in different
ways if there is no overlapping in monomials to which we apply the rules, the paths are going

to be essentially the same. An example of such ‘no overlapping’ is: f = —xy* + xy° 2, yp +x 2
yP —y* and f= —2y! +2?  -ryt —y Sy — yt,

So, whenever there is no overlapping in the application of the rewriting rules, let us colour
the ‘area’ between those applications of the rewriting rule. An ‘area’ betweeen rewriting rules is
called a cell.
