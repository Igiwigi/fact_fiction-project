= Solving these differential equations for the particular cases of n=2 and n=3,
= Mr. Hazrey arrived at the actual expression of the roots of the given algebraic equation
bal for these cases. That all algebraic equations up to the fifth degree can be reduced to
= the above trinomial form, is well known.
S A solution of (1) by means of definite triple integrals in the case of n=4 has been
S published by Mr. W, H. L. RussELL; and I am informed that a general 80lution of the
- equation by means of a definite single integral has been obtained by the same analyst.
While the subject seems to be more important with relation to differential than with
reference to algebraic equations, the connexion into which the two subjects are brought
must itself be considered as a yery interesting fact, As respects the former of these
8ubjects, it may be observed that it is a matter of quite fundamental importance to
ascertain for what forms of the function pþ (D), equations of the type

admit, of finite solution. We possess theorems which enable us to deduce from each
known integrable form an infinite number of others, Yet there is every reason to think
