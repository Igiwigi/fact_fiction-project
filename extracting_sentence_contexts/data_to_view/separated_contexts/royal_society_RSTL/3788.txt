It is thus proved that the legs and antennz of the Iulidz are reproduced at the
change of skin. Since making these experiments, I have met with many instances
in which these parts have been reproduced, as indicated by comparison with corre-
sponding parts in the same animals. In no instance has the fact been better exem-
plified in the Tulidze than in a specimen of Spirostreptus microsticticus*, Newy., from
the coast of Africa, now in the cabinets of the British Museum, in which most of the
legs on the left ide of five segments of the body, from the thirty-ninth to the forty-
third, have been reproduced, while the animal was living in its natural haunts. In most
of these the entire limbs, including their basilar or coxal joints, have been restored,
each limb being perfect in all its joints, eyen including the terminal claw, although
not more than one-half the size of the corresponding limb on the opposite side of the
same segment. PFrom these facts, it appears that the reproduction of a lost part in
the Iulide may take place either in connexion with some portion of the original
organ, or may be entirely independent of it, as when eyery portion of the original
organ is removed.
