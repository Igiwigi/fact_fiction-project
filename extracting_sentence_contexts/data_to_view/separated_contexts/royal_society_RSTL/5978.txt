It is easy to conceive that ice moving
Z over an uneven bed, will, when it is released from one opposing obstacle, be checked by
= another, and its motion thus be rendered sensibly uniform. So many obstacles exist
Þ along the bed of a glacier, that sudden slipping forwards of the mass through any con-
© giderable distance is not to be expected. But the real weak point of Saus8URE's theory,
.5 though partly true, is its inability to account for many facts observed since his time. 5 The theory of CHarPENTIER, though not always fairly represented, has been shown to be
Z untenable.
