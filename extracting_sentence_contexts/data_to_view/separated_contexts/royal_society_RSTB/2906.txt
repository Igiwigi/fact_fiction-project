W. G. RIDEWOOD ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE

interlamellar extensions of the filaments were found to be greatly dilated, but this
may possibly be due to the fact that the mode of killing caused the gills to become
gorged with blood. . The gills of Cardissa cardissa (Hemicardium cardissa) have about twenty-four |
filaments to the plica. The principal filaments are not much larger than the ordinary
filaments ; their frontal surface has the form of a shallow ridge,
Serripes groenlandicum has 12-14 filaments to the plica in the outer demibranch,
and 20-22 in the inner.
