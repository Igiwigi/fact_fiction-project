PARKER and RUPERT JoxEs, and myself, in our studies of
the types to which we have respectively given our principal attention *,

236. The general fact which I desire to bring prominently forward as the result of
recent investigations into this group, is, that in all the types possessing a wide geogra-
phical distribution, which have been specially studied by myself or by others, the range of
variation has also been very wide; 80 that not only what would commonly be considered
as specific, but such as have been regarded as generic, and in s80me cases even as ordinal
differences, present themselves among organisms, which, from the intimacy of the
relationship that is evinced by the gradational character of those differences as well as
by the variations presented by the several parts of one and the same organism, must in
all probability have had a common origin. And it appears to me to be a justifiable
inference from this fact, that the wide range of forms which this group contains is more
likely to have come into existence as a result of modifications successively occurring in
the course of descent from a small number of original types, than by the vast number of
originally distinct creations which on the ordinary hypothesis would be required to
account for it4.

237. The greater part of my First Memoir was devoted to the investigation of the
single type Orbitolites; and I there showed that not only as regards the size, shape, and
other external characters of the organism as a whole, but even as regards the size and
form of its elementary parts (in which greater constancy might be expected), is there 80
great a variation, —the most marked diyersities being apparent even in different parts of
the same individual, —that all attempts to found specific distinctions upon such variations
are utterly futile. But further, T showed that a distinction on which almost any Natu-
ralist would feel justified in relying as of at least specific if not of generic value, —that
between the smple type in which the chambers are arranged on only one plane, and the
complex type in which there are two superficial planes more or less strongly differentiated
from the median,—is no less invalid.
