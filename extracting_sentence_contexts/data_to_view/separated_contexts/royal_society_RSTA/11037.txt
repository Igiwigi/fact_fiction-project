The data for the solution volume are given in Table XI. and are
represented graphically in diagrams V. and VI. In discussing the significance of the variations of solution volume it may be
regarded as certain that the great variation in the case of dilute, as compared with
concentrated, solutions must be attributed to the complex character of liquid water
and not to any complexity introduced by the addition of soda. It appears, in fact,
that the maximum of simplicity is reached in a 50-per cent. solution at 100° C., and
that the most complex solution with which we have to deal is water. The complex character of the water molecule was demonstrated by Raouur (‘ Ann,
Chim, Phys.,’ 1884, (6), vol. 2, p. 66), and was made use of by RéntGEN (‘ Wied. Ann.,’ 1891, vol. 45, p. 91), who attributed the increase of density between 0° C.
and 4° C. to the dissociation of “ice molecules” having a greater molecular volume
than the water molecules.
