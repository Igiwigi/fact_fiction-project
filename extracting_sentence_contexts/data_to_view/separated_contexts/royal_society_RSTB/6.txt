Moreover, it was a
by no means uncommon occurrence to see similar filaments on the inside of a stoma
closely applied to the walls of the guard-cells, and evidently making their way
inwards. It seems not improbable that these isolated filaments are really pieces of
the germinal tubes, which have been formed at some distance from the stomata, and
have become detached by the decay of the exhausted portions of hyphz or spores
behind them. I have already shown that the protoplasm passes along into the ends
of the delicate germinal tubes, leaving the empty and exhausted portions behind to
die off (cf. fig. 24), and it is certainly not impossible that by this means these
filaments can creep forward, so to speak, to distances greater than the tube full of
protoplasm can reach—in fact, we may say the germinal tube creeps along by building
its own ladder behind it. Be this as it may, the leaves are easily infected by means of the conidia, and in
nearly every case a pallid greenish-white spot was found on the infected leaf in from
18 to 19 days from the sowing: moreover, the spot was always confined to the area
on which the sowing was made. The following list of infections will serve to illustrate this.
