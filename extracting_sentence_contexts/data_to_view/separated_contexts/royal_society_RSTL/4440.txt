The experiments with the smaller quantities of oxide show

also the same kind of progressive increase of loss, as already observed with the chlo-
ride; the increase however is not s0 constant. In experiments 4 and 5 exactly half
the oxide is reduced; the ratio of the oxygen in the oxide of silyer taken, to the
oxygen from the oxide reduced, being in the two experiments as 100 : 51'2 and
100 : 49:31 ; the presence however of carbonate of silver in the oxide renders this fact
less certain than the similar fact observed in the case of the chloride of silver
(Table I.).

repeated these experiments with another preparation of the peroxide, the peroxide
O, containing 757 per cent. of oxygen ; 3'12 grins. of oxide of silver are equivalent
to 3 grms. of this peroxide.
