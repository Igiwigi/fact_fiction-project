The penetration of smart devices and Internet connectivity may not be at 100% but the
majority of human beings on the planet are connected in some way to the Internet and
most importantly have made the Internet an integral part of their tool of trade. The
smartphone has become a sort of prosthetic for our memory, for our capacity to reach


out to information and services to the point that we no longer perceive this. In fact, the
smartphone is augmenting our capabilities. In a short period of time, it will feel perfectly
normal to speak our language and literally hear the sound of our voices coming out of
the smartphone in another language. We already have quasi-real-time translation, and we
have software that can imitate the inflection and tone of our voice.
