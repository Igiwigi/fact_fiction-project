We have already alluded to the views put forward to account for the increase of
respiratory effort at high altitudes; one of these views assumed that at a certain
stage the blood became more acid, the other that at a certain stage it became more
alkaline. These views were held by many to be mutually exclusive ; the antithesis
was heightened by the names given to them, for they were sometimes alluded to as
the “acidosis” and “alkalosis” theories. The more thorough investigation which we
have been able to give indicates that, so far from being mutually exclusive, they are
complementary. The blood at rest is, if anything, more alkaline at high altitudes
than at low ones—a change which would lead to apnoea but for the fact that the
respiratory centre is rendered more sensitive by reason of deficient oxygen supply.
The effect of change in reaction is, if it exists, more than balanced by that of the
change in sensitivity, hence a somewhat increased total ventilation at rest. When
exercise is taken a given increment in hydrogen-ion concentration is caused by a much
less amount of exercise at the high altitudes than at the sea-level. Even, therefore,
were the irritability of the respiratory centre the same, the subject would suffer
from breathlessness on exercise. With a heightened irritability he suffers doubly.

C, THe Movement or THE OxyGen Dissociation Curve.

An examination of the blood of three natives of the mountains showed that the
oxygen dissociation curve of the hemoglobin as it circulated in the body was different
