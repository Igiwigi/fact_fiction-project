Figure 3. Snapshots of a planar slice of annihilating monopole and antimonopole for A = 1, y = Oand v, = 0.5. The colours
represent energy density. (Online version in colour.)

(b) MM scattering

The initial conditions for a monopoleâ€”antimonopole pair were also evolved using the classical
equations of motion in [8]. Figure 3 shows snapshots of the scattering for an untwisted MM, while
figure 4 shows the scattering when the MM. are twisted (y =z). In the untwisted case, the MM
annihilate, while in the twisted case they come close but not close enough to annihilate. In fact,
they bounce back as seen in figure 5.

(). MM creation

Next, we discuss the creation of MM. The issue is that monopoles are described as solutions to
the classical equations of motion, while particles are quanta in a quantum field theory. So MM
creation requires a description of magnetic monopoles in a quantum field theory. Furthermore, a
monopole is a non-perturbative solution since its magnetic charge is proportional to 1/g, where
g is the gauge coupling. Perturbative calculations can only give a power law expansion in g and
cannot describe monopoles. Thus, any attempt at a perturbative calculation of the MM creation
amplitude is sure to fail.
