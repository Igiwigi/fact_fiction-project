A very curious feature of this explosion, which is well shown in the photo-
graphs, is the subsequent occurrence of a non-luminous region between the ‘highly
luminous flame-front and the luminous carbon in its rear; and it is now being further -
investigated by us. No. 30.—Explosions initiated by a * detonator”? in (a) a 4C,N, + O, and (6) a N,O
Medium, respectively, in a Tube 1-3 ems. internal diameter. The interest of these two photographs lies in the fact of their both showing signs of

a “spinning head” in the flame-front just before the latter ceased to be visible at forward
flame-speeds of approximately 1,400 metres per second. No. 31.—Bursting of a Detonator (d.) in Air in a Tube of 1-3 ems. internal diameter. Showing a “banded structure” presumably due to “ spin” in the incandescent
gaseous products following the “ shock wave ” from the detonator.
