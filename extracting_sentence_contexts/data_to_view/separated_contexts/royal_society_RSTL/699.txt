Both these- latter: ingredients are; I/ think,
essential to the composition of this fossil, as/L have always:dis-
covered them in the purest specimens: -In/this mode of analysis
I experienced the same difficulty and tediousness of 'delay in
bringing the last portions of the solution/ to-crystallize into
alum. - This anomalous circumstance I haye reason to attribute
to a particular combination, -which- takes place between the
sulphat of alumina and lime, silica, and potash.. | In my exami-
nation of the compact species there was no appearance of the
sulphat of lime until the last; and in every-experiment, previ-
ously to the fresh appearance. of crystals of alum, that had
been long delayed, silica and sulphat of lime were deposited. I forbear entering into any further-;details concerning my
former experiments on this-curious fossil; as-I- have reason to
think that it will still require a more-particular and minute ex-
amination, on account of another ingredient which eluded my
notice, and which may possibly. impart to itits peculiar character. The scarcity of it has been hitherto a great bar to my experi-
ments ; I shall record, however, a few. facts' which. I have
lately observed, in the hope that at-a future time I may be able
to resume my examination of it. I was induced to pay more attention to the volatile ingre-
dients of this substance.* With this view, I introduced some
of the crystals into a small retort, adapted a receiver unto it,

* Mr, Humynry Davy, whose well known skill and sagacity have probably ren-
dered' the researches of another person superfluous, had, I found, been engaged in the
analysis of a mineral which is thought to be identical with the subject of these obzere
vations.
