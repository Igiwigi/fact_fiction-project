* Of course, we must sort out from the observed emission spectrum as ‘satellites’ any parts which
are due to initial double ionization of an atom core. Also, there is a formal distinction between emission
and absorption experiments, since, in the latter, an electron is missing from an inner shell after the
transition. There may be levels of the particular atom whose existence depends on this electron being
away. The ‘lines’ in the soft X-ray absorption of alkali ions in alkali halides (O'Bryan 1936) probably
have this origin, but no such effect occurs for metals.

Owing to the fact that the spread of the wave function for the X-ray levels is small
compared with the lattice constant, the determination of /(£) is largely an atomic
problem, as was pointed out by Jones, Mott and Skinner (1934). The simplest treat-
ment is to expand the wave function y of an electronic level of the lattice in a series
of functions ¥,, yp, Yas ---» having the symmetry of s, p, d, ... atomic wave functions in
the neighbourhood of the nuclei. Thus we write

¥=A,¥,+A,v,+AYat seep

where | A, ?-- 4, P+ | 4g |? 2 = 1.
If we then write N,(E) = N(E) | A, |?, etc.,
we have N(E) = N,(E)+N,(E) +N, (E)+-..5 (3)
