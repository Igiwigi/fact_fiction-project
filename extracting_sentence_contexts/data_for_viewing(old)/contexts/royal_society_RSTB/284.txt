ciated with two distinct, though not wholly dissimilar, rhizomes. The French savant
described the two genera Zygopteris and Anachoropteris as distinguished primarily by
the differences between these petioles, but secondarily by the differences between
their rhizomes.

In my memoir, Part VIII. (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ vol. 167, pp. 217 et seq.), when de-
scribing a new rhizome and its petioles, under the name of Rachiopteris corrugata,
I gave at some length my reasons for not multiplying generic names for these
curious plants ; pointing out how wholly impossible it was to classify recent Ferns
on any such basis, a fact the importance of which is further illustrated by the
rhizome which I am about to describe.

Some weeks ago, my young auxiliary collector, Mr. Lomax, to whom I was indebted
for the Calamitean fruits described in my last memoir, Part XIV., brought me a
specimen having the central vascular axis of M. Renauur’s Anachoropteris Decaisnii,
with petioles of the true Zygopteroid type : thus demonstrating that the axis found
by Renavtr in connection with a petiole of Corpa’s type of Anachoropteris was
equally the axis of a Zygopteroid petiole. The specimen has been a drifted fragment,
now imbedded in a hard ganister full of Goniatites.

Fig. 1 (Plate 1) shows the five-rayed transverse section of the vascular axis of the
stem or rhizome; at @ is a vacant spot, occupied in some sections by a delicate
