distribution of natural grains will always have an R value greater than unity. We have illustrated :2
this in figure 3, which shows the random sphere distribution line (RSDL), that delimits the ordered 18

from clustered states as a function of the solid volume per cent. The interested reader is directed
to fig. 5 of [67] for the derivation of the RSDL as a function of solid volume per cent.

The R value of four simulations as a function of solid volume per cent is shown in figure 3,
which is a plot of R as a function of solid volume per cent. The RSDL, as developed in [67],
is shown dividing the clustered from ordered regions. A number of interesting features are
apparent. Firstly, note that the t =0 values for the four simulations increasingly depart from the
expected ideal RSDL as the solid volume per cent increases. This is a consequence of the fact
that our initialization of the domain, which is based on a thinned continuous pseudorandom
algorithm, leads to an apparent ordering; that is an artefact. This arises as the domain is
progressively initialized with finite area particles; the remaining space induces a filtering such
that a truly random choice is moderated by the available locations that can accommodate a
particle. Secondly, it is interesting to note that for any individual simulation, there is not a large
change in the solid per cent of the mobile region as the simulation proceeds. This is due to the
fact that the loss of particles to the settled bed, which should decrease solid per cent, is almost
balanced by the reduction in the mobile volume that contains crystals. For example, in figures 1
and 2, the mobile volume is between the horizontal yellow line and the settled bed, and the
solid volume per cent stays nearly constant in that region. The fact that the solid per cent does
not change markedly as the simulations proceed suggests that there is a local self-similarity or
qualitative stationary state in the average mass per cent.
