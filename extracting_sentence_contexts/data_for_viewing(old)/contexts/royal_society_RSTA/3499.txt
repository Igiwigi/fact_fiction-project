Figure 2. (a) Multi-model mean change in export production of organic particles at 100m in 2090-2099 relative to
1990-1999 under RCP8.5. Stippling marks high robustness between models and is defined from agreement on sign of changes.

figure 1c), averaged between 20°S and 20°N and for each of the individual ESMs used in this study. Changes as simulated by
GFDL-ESM2G in (c) subsurface AOU (mol m~3) and (d) ventilation age (years) in 2090-2099 relative to 1990-1999 under RCP8.5.

4. (De)oxygenation throughout the last deglaciation

Palaeoclimate records of ocean oxygenation have been used to show how oceanic oxygen levels
have varied in response to past episodes of climate change. This is the case, in particular, for the
last deglaciation, for which Jaccard & Galbraith [17] have revealed a clear de-oxygenation trend
of the upper ocean (and hence an expansion of low-oxygen waters in the Pacific Basin and Indian
Basin) concomitantly with an overall oxygenation of the deeper ocean. Despite the fact that these
past changes were much slower than the current ones, they offer an interesting perspective on
future ocean deoxygenation.

(a) Model-data comparison

Due to the limited number of data points in the reconstruction we use here, we have not
attempted to perform a point-by-point co-localized model-data comparison. In addition, because
the simulated changes in oxygen levels between the LGM and the MH as simulated by IPSL-
CM5A-LR show a certain homogeneity regardless of the longitude, we perform this comparison
ona zonal average basis, as shown in figure 3.
