It is not improbable, however, that
some law of variation will still hold from point to point in the direction of flow ; and if
80, the same formula would apply, only that for k s0mething much smaller than the true
conductivity of the metal must be substituted. 'Thus, supposing & to be a function of w,
smaller the smaller is w and increasing to a limit (the true conductivity of the metal),
your experiments might give values of þ for different rates of the flow of the water by

It would be necessary to ascertain by experiment how nearly the geometrical law of
decrease of the difference of temperatures along the tube holds, as there is no sufficient
theory for convection to give any decided indication.

metal, it would be better perhaps to take £ as the thing to be determined: calling it
