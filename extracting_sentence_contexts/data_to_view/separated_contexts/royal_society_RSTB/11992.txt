1.0 * for village endogamy was stronger than the preference
for cousin marriages: the number of marriages within the
same village exceeded the total number of preferential
marriages, in particular between ego and mother’s brother’s

o8 daughter, and between ego and father’s sister’s daughter

g [18]. Consequently, the matrilineal puzzle, and its conse-

> 06 quences in terms of endogamy, is a more likely candidate

5 , than the prevalence of cousin marriages to explain the

8 observed differences in genetic patterns between M, C and
5 04 P populations.

op Note also that, despite the fact that M populations are

5 famous for their high paternity uncertainty rate ([12] and refer-

02 ences therein), we do not think this process could contribute to

. the observed genetic differences between M, C and P popu-

lations. Indeed, we would expect such paternity uncertainty

0 to decrease, rather than increase, the genetic inbreeding level

in these populations in comparison to patrilineal populations;
for example, a child born from first cousins may have lower
genetic inbreeding coefficient than expected because his
parents may share the same grandmother but different
grandfathers. In patrilineal and patrilocal populations, the matrilineal
puzzle does not occur as most men settle with their wife in
their natal village whether they marry a woman from the
same or from another village, with no risk of losing their pos-
