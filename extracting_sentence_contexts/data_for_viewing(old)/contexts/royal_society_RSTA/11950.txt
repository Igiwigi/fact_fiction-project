d to have lost half its original quantity of oxygen. It then contained 90 volumes
oxygen and as much as 31 volumes of carbon dioxide, along with several other
ses. Now we have already seen that platinum black absorbs more oxygen on
ating, provided the temperature does not rise above 860° C., and we are unable to
(plain why BerrHetor's platinum black lost oxygen, more especially as we found
hat even in vacuo the oxygen does not begin to come off until the temperature of
yout 300° C. is reached.

The heat which is evolved on the absorption of hydrogen by platinum black has
zen measured by BerrHeror™ and by Favrr,t and has been used by Bertuetor as
§ additional argument in favour of his formule. In view of the fact, however, that the
mat due to the combination of the oxygen pre-existing in the platinum black with
ydrogen is also included in these measurements, no safe conclusion can be drawn
Pom these numbers. Until a sample of platinum black can be prepared free from
ygen and other impurities, or until the amount of oxygen contained in it has been
operly allowed for, the numbers supposed to represent the heat of absorption of
rogen by platinum black are of little value.

ef a chemical compound of platinum and hydrogen exists at all we would from
alogy prefer to look for a compound similar to Pd,H, but as the existence of even
substance has been recently called in question,{ we prefer for the present to
dive the matter as it stands until sufficient data have been accumulated for an
