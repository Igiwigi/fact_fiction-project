(b) Effective static response of a composite

Early work (and also much later work) on the static response of a composite was strongly
influenced by Hill [11], who emphasized the need for a mathematical definition of effective
response that would reflect (at least in principle) what could be measured experimentally. The
simplest type of experiment for determining, for example, Young’s modulus of an apparently
homogeneous material is to take a bar of the material and subject it to uniaxial tension, under
either displacement control or load control. If the material really were homogeneous, the result
of either experiment would be the same, though if the material were in fact heterogeneous the
results would generally differ. Hill observed that, if a finite specimen is subjected to a prescribed
displacement u;(x) = @;x; over the whole of its boundary generating, in general, a non-uniform
strain field within the specimen, the volume average of the strain is ej exactly and the volume
average 6; of the stress is given exactly by the relation
