(6) That they are transmitted through a separate layer lying above that which transmits P..

(c) That they are transmitted through a block of rock lying beside the others, and
forming part of the same complex.


136 P. L. WILLMORE ON SEISMIC EXPERIMENTS

The decision between (a) and (b) would be important in a study of the geology of the
upper layers, but the present work is concerned mainly with waves refracted up from greater
depths. From this point of view it is sufficient to point out that both hypotheses require the
existence ofa layer above the one which transmits P,, and thick enough to cause the observed
delays. In fact, the data will not decide between (a), (b) and (c), and in assigning an average
velocity to P, we have no means of choosing between a single layer whose velocity ranges
from 3-5 to 4-9km./sec. and a structure with a velocity of less than 3-5 km./sec. near the
surface, and 4-3 to 4-9km./sec. at depth. For convenience in the ensuing calculations an
arbitrary velocity of 4-4 km./sec. will be used.

(c) 24 to 106km.

At distances beyond 24km. the velocity of the first arrivals is always greater than
5-6 km./sec., and the apparent delays of starting greater than 1-79 sec. The transition from
P. is clearly observed on all four of the Soltau profiles, and there are a few cases where P, is
observed as a second arrival.
