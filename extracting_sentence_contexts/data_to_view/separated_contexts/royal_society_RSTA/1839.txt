If the 3d orbital electron is the last to enter
the atom, it should be the one to be ionized instead of a 4s electron. What Schwarz has asserted is that in scandium and following transition metal atoms, the
3d orbitals are in fact occupied before, or in preference to, the 4s orbital and there is ample
experimental evidence for this claim [34]. The advantage of Schwarz’s version of the facts is that
it restores logic to the situation. The 4s electrons are the last to enter the atom in the sense of the
build-up of the configuration and consequently are the least stable, and so the first to be ionized.”

7The energy of an orbital cannot be specified independently of the occupancy of the orbital due to e-e repulsion. So in a Ti
atom with configuration 3d24s2, 4s lies above 3d.
