H. GILBERT ON THE COMPOSITION OF

of animal, to determine the composition of the increase from one condition to anoth;
supposing this to be represented by the difference in weight between the animal
was analysed in the lean, and that which was analysed in the fat condition—it may
observed, that owing to the larger frame, and growing rather than fattening character,
of the half-fat Ox analysed, compared with the fatter one, it approached 80 nearly the
actual weight of the latter, as to indicate (if the difference in weight were alone taken
as the measure) a very small amount of actual increase ; whilst the difference in the
composition of the two animals was very considerable. In fact, in the case suPpposed,
the s0-calculated total or gross imcrease would be less than the estimated gain in dry
$ubstance of increase alone: that is to say, it would appear” that there had been an
actual displacement of water, and replacement of it by a corresponding amount of dry
substance. It may be said that the displacement of water, and the replacement of it by
fat, in the fattening animal, or in other words a greater increase in dry s4bstance than in
the gross live-weight, is not impossible. The consideration of the results relating to the
Pigs, as well as the tendency of obseryation, comparing animals of this description with
others, would, however, militate against such an assumption.
