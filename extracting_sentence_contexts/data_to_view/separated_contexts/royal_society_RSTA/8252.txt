To do this, introduce two functions of the complex variable, z = e/a defined by :—

V=¢+ip'=2 (RL 48) one a a (7.11)
0

W= d+ =3(-U, +h) ore (7.12)
0

in terms of which it is easy to verify that :—

It is evident, from their definitions in (7.11) and (7.12) that the four functions
¢, $', » and ¥’ are completely determined by the system of applied tractions. It will
be shown later that V and W are expressible as definite integrals, but in most of the
examples chosen it has been simpler to determine the Fourrer co-efficients, and
then sum the series (7.11) and (7.12). In fact, except in the simplest cases, and
sometimes for values of 7/a not much greater than 1, the stresses are calculated from
the formule of paragraph (5) with less trouble than by those just given. Equally
compact formule for y and the displacements have not been found, but x is only a
mathematical convenience, with no obvious physical significance, and the displacements,
as has been mentioned, are small and of little account in practice. Remembering the relations, which hold for conjugate functions :—

it is easily verified that the formule of this paragraph satisfy the fundamental equations
of equilibrium, (2.1).
