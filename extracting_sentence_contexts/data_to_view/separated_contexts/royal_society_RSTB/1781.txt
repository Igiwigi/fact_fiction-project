Later
stages (fig. 38) show that there is no exact type or form of segmentation of the
several sporogenous groups, a conclusion which might have been anticipated fiom
comparison of fig. 37, as well as of the mature sporangia, and of the facts relating to
Danea. Tangential sections of the sorus are difficult to obtain so as to give easily intel-
ligible results, owing to the curved form of the sporangium ; but if a section be cut
in the direction XX, fig. 34, the appearance presented will be as in fig. 39, in which
it is easy to see how the several tissues will correspond. An interesting fact which
is brought out by such a section is that the groups of cells of the sterile tissue,
which forms the septum between two adjoining sporogenous groups, are of similar
origin with these, and at first differ in no respect from them, except in the less dense
protoplasm, usually smaller nuclei, and in the fact that they do not eventually form
spores. Very shortly after the stage shown in fig. 39, the growth of the tissue
above the sterile septa becomes more active than that above the sporangia, and the
result is the formation of a narrow slit-like depression (fig. 40); but as is shown by
figs. 35, 36, 41, this extends only for a short distance in a radial direction, while its
position is upon the oblique inner rim of the sorus. It is at the base of this slit that
the rupture takes place at maturity, the cells adjoining it, both below and laterally,
dry up, and the result is that the pore gapes open in much the same way as that
described for Danea.
