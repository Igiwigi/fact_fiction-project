'The cribriform
plate is rather shorter in proportion to the base of the skull in the Glyptodon than in
> the ordinary Armadillos, and its anterior part is situated far further back in relation to
the antorbital processes. The proper cranial cavity, or brain-case, is 8mall when compared with the whole size
of the 8kull, if the chambers.which lodge the olfactory bulbs are left out of considera-
tion. Tt is in fact only 45 inches long,.2'5 inches wide at widest, and about 1% inch
high at highest. Tts greatest width is situated beneath the occipital ridge, whence it
narrows towards. the olfactory outlet, which is about 1-25 inch wide.
