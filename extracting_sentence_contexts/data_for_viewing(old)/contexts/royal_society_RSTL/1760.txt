of the assumed data on which the generally received formula is founded,
When the arc is very large, the formula will not lead us to the true result :
this has been already noticed by more than one author. But whether the dif-
ference arises from a defect in the formula, or from a sliding of the knife edges,
or from the variable effect of the air on the pendulum, or from all three, re-
mains $till to be demonstrated. Should any experiments for determining this
point be commenced, it would perhaps be better that the vacuum apparatus
should not be used for the purpose: but that a heavy sphere, cylinder, or lens,
suspended by a wire, be swung in free air, first on the knife edge, and after-
wards oyer a steel cylinder; due care being taken, in the latter case, that the
wire be Fat at that portion of it which passes over the cylinder. A body of
this kind will continue its vibrations for a sufficient length of time for such
experiments : which was in fact the reason for adopting the vacuum apparatus
for this purpose ; but which may present difficulties of another kind ; since it
is difficult to prevent a leakage in the yacuum apparatus, which has a material
effect on the arc of vibration ; and moreover the proximity of the pendulum to
the sides of the tube, when swinging in large arcs, may influence the results.
But, whateyer be the cause of the discordancy, it is evident that in the pre-
sent state of the subject we cannot strictly compare the results of experiments,
where the arcs employed haye been widely different. The initial arc ought in
no case to exceed one degree: in my own experiments, I have generally com-
menced with an arc of about 0*:9 or 9*8 ; but this I think is still too large, and
were I again to undertake any delicate experiments on the pendulum, I should
probably make the initial are about half a degree only, In the experiments
