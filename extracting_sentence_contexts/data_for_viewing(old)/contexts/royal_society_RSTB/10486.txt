with competition among gametes over fertilization [9].

Because of polyandry, we adopt Jennions & Kokko’s [10]
definition of sexual selection, which recognizes that mating
does not guarantee parentage when females mate with mul-
tiple males. Thus, ‘sexual selection favours traits that improve
the likelihood of fertilization given limited access to opposite
sex gametes due to competition with members of the same
sex’. The definition thus acknowledges that traits subject to
sexual selection may not be as visually spectacular as the elab-
orate displays of, say, a male peacock, but this does not make
them any less important to an individual’s reproductive suc-
cess. In fact, as we argue in §6, we may miss a suite of more
subtle mechanisms that profoundly affect sexual selection if
we stick to studying the usual suspects.

The organisms that are the topic of our review are often
dismissed as ‘unusual’, simply because they have been less
studied and their sex life happens to be rather different
from ours. Unlike the more conventional study organisms,
all or most selection acts after the gametes have been released.
They include many simultaneous hermaphroditic animals in
which mating partners interact directly, spermcasters and
broadcast spawners as well as wind-pollinated plants that
never meet during reproduction, plants that require a third
