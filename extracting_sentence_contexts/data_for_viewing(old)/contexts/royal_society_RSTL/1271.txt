detached many of these lateral branches from the principal
stems, letting them remain suspended by such a portion only
of alburnous and cortical fibres and vessels as were sufficient
to preserve life. In this position I conceived that if their
leaves and stems contained any unemployed true sap, it could
not readily find its way to the tuberous roots, its passage
being obstructed by the rupture of the vessels, and by gravi-
tation; and I had soon the pleasure to see that instead of
returning down the principal stem into the ground, it remained
and formed small tubers at the base of the leaves of the
depending branches.

The preceding facts are, I think, sufficient to prove that the
Auid, from which the tuberous root of the potatoe, when
growing beneath the soil, derives its component matter, exists
previously either in the stems or leaves; and that it subse-
quently descends into the earth: and as the cortical vessels
during every period of the growth of the tuber are filled with

the true sap of the plant, and as these vessels extend into the
runners, which carry nutriment to the tuber, and in. other
instances evidently convey the true sap downwards, there
