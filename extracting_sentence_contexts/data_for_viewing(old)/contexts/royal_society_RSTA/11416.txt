My next step was to form some estimate of the extent to which fecundity thus
measured was the same for different periods in a mare’s breeding career. I expected
fecundity to diminish with age as in the case of mankind, but taking out a fairly
large test number of mares, I found that their fecundity for the periods covered by
two successive stud-books was in the majority of cases closely the same. With larger
experience 1 should now lay more weight on the decrease of fecundity with age ; and
Lalso think fecundity is smaller when the mare first goes to the stud. But even
thus much of the reduced fecundity of old mares seems to arise from breeders sending
famous mares to the sire long after their breeding days are passed. I have several
records of old mares being covered seven or eight times without offspring. This
custom of breeders was much more rife in the early days of breeding than it appears
to be now, when some breeders discard or sell a fairly old mare, even if she is barren
two or three successive years. Clearly the custom gives the mare a fictitious
fecundity, far below her real value, and probably accounts for granddams having a
somewhat less fecundity than their granddaughters.

The next problem to be answered was the effect the method of forming my
fecundity ratios might have on the relative numbers which would be found in
different element-groups. For example, supposing the element of fecundity to be
1/10, or the element-groups 0-1/20, 1/20-3/20, 3/20-5/20, . . . 17/20-19/20, 19/20-1,
would the fact that the fecundity ratio is a ratio of whole numbers cause, @ priori, a
greater probability of frequency in one of these element-groups than another ?

To begin with, all estimation of fecundity based on less than fowr coverings was
discarded. Three coverings give too rough an appreciation of a mare’s fecundity, it
