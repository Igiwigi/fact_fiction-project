648 MR. J. LISTER ON THE EARLY STAGES OF INFLAMMATION.

each © rouleau” adhering to other rouleaux, a network is produced with intervals of
colourless liquor sanguinis. Rapid movement of the blood prevents this occurrence, but
it commences as 800n as the corpuscles approach to a state of quiescence, and 1 have
seen $hort rouleaux already present in a drop drawn from my own finger within ten
seconds of its emission. In this respect the aggregation of the red corpuscles differs
from the coagulation of the fibrine, which does not begin till s0me minutes after with-
drawal from the vessels. There is, in fact, no connexion whatever between the two
processes, as 1s clear from the circumstance that if a drop of blood is stirred with a
needle while coagulation is taking place, 80 as to remove the whole of the tibrine, the
corpuscles, which have been separated from one another by the agitation to which they
have been 8nbjected, aggregate again in the serum in the same manner as they did at
first in the liquor sanguinis. The beautifully regular form of the long masses of
corpuscles has suggested to s0me persons the idea of the operation of some peculiar
vital attraction in their formation, while by others the aggregation has been supposed
due to merely physical causes, but has never, I think, received a complete explanation,
For my own part, I am satisfied that the rouleaux are smply the result of the biconcave
form of the red discs, together with a certain, though not very great degree of adhesive-
ness, which retains them pretty firmly attached together when in the position most
favourable for its operation, namely, when the margins of their concave surfaces are
