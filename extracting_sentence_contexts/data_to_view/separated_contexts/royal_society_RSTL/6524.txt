On
the one hand, in the normal condition, the mesial processes of the intermaxillaries are
obviously present ; and in the cleft-palate condition, on the other hand, there can be no
doubt that the lateral plates are represented as well as the mesial processes, since the
incisor teeth are developed on the mesial bone. Thus it is certain that, according as
the palate is completely closed or remains cleft, the whole intermaxillary—both mesial
and lateral portion—comes from one or other of two parts which at an early period are
always quite distinct. This is a fact of great importance. Morphological Conelusions respecting the Vomer, Ethmoid, and Intermazillaries
