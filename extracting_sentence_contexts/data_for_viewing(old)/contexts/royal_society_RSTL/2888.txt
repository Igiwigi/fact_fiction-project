With respect to the chemical nature of these crystals, it appears to me evident that
they consist of boracic acid. They are obtained by dissolving borax in phosphorie
acid; and it may be inferred that this latter substance unites with the alkali and
isolates the boracic acid. In order to ee if this supposition were correct, I dissolyed
boracie acid in alcohol, and I found that a drop of this solution evaporated on a plate
of glass frequently yielded an abundant crop of the crystalline spherules. But these
are generally exceedingly small, requiring a high power to display in them the cross
and four sectors of light, and they speedily grow opake ; for which reason they are
not 80 well suited for observation as those prepared by the former method. They
establish the fact, however, that this mode of crystallizing is a property of the boracic
acid. It is highly improbable that it should be peculiar to that substance, but I haye
not yet met with it in any other.

$ 3. Explanation of some of the Optical appearances.

1. When any doubly refracting crystal is examined with the polarizing microscope,
(the polarizers being transyerse to each other, and the field of view consequently
dark,) if it be turned round in one plane, it is scen to grow four times /uminous and
four times dark in the course of one revolution. This I have found to be universally
the case with all the substances which I have tried, and it also is in accordance with
theory.
