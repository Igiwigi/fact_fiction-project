The reflecting substance which composes the iridocytes and argenteum of the skins
of Fishes is guanin, the optical properties of which are very remarkable. The presence
of guanin in Fishes’ skins was first demonstrated by Barreswit and Vorr, about
30 years ago. This important physiological fact was reached indirectly by the
analysis of the peculiar substance used for the manufacture of artificial pearls. These
pearls are made chiefly in Paris from material which goes under the names of “blanc
dablette” and “essence d’Orient.” Ablette is the French name for the Bleak, a
fresh-water Fish whose specific name is Alburnus lucidus, and from the scales of which
the substance is prepared.
