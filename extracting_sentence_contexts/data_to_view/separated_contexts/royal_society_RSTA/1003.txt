In the case of the magnetic hydrogel
containing FeuPs@PEG@Fmoc-FF, instead of a sharp drop followed by a smooth enhancement
of G’, a progressive decrement of G’ with time for several hours was observed (see inserted
plot in figure 1a). Our hypothesis is that columnar structures built by microparticles were too
heavy to be held by the peptide structure, which provoked a progressive, partial collapse. In fact,

FeNPs@PEG@Fmoc-FF particles and magnetic peptide hydrogel based on FepPs@PEG@Fmoc-FF. Note that similar general
features were obtained for other aliquots of the same samples. (b,c) Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM)

this agreed with direct observations that showed a not perfectly homogeneous hydrogel in this
case. Note, nevertheless, that G’ continued to be considerably higher for magnetic hydrogels even
after switching off the field, which can be explained considering that the particle structures were
engulfed by the peptides.
