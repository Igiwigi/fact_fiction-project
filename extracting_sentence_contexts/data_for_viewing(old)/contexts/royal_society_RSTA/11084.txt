propagation varies in the case of different earthquakes, being dependent in some way
on the size of the waves set up by it. In the case of the greatest earthquakes, which
are recorded at distances of 60° and over, this rate of propagation appears to be
practically always about 2°9 kiloms. per second for the principal and largest waves,

and may rise to over 4:0 kiloms. per second for the long low waves which outrun the
principal ones.

The conclusion drawn from the records is greatly strengthened by the fact that, in
the case of the great earthquake of 1897, the only one where the rate of propagation
has been carefully determined within the seismic area as well as at a distance, it
was found that the rate of propagation of the sensible shock, from the origin to
distances up to 15° of are, was practically the same as the rate of propagation of the
waves of the third phase to a distance of 65° of are. The actual difference as
calculated is but 0°1 kilom. per second, or about one-thirtieth of the value, a
difference which is well within the inevitable limits of error of the observations.

The nature of these waves has yet to be elucidated. The elastic surface waves
investigated by Lord Rayreren should travel, in material of the nature of the
rocks with which we are acquainted, at a rate of about 0°9 of the rate of propagation
of a distortional plane wave in an infinite solid. This for continuous rock of the
