It would be
well worth the attention of miners, to keep a constant look out
for this substance, which, I am informed, is not rare in Corn-
wall. It contains no iron, and no sulphur; the absence of which
latter is a peculiar advantage. It is a fact not generally known,
I believe, that there is hardly such a thing in commerce, as cop-
per which does not contain a little sulphur ; at least I have rarely
met with any such; and it requires but a very minute portion
of sulphur, to increase the fusibility of copper. "The advantage
of obtaining copper free from sulphur, is too obvious to require
to be pointed out; and that advantage does this ore possess,

To work it separately, if ever it should be found in sufficient
quantity, would well repay the labour it would cost; and a very

small mixture of any disoxidating s8ubstance would, in a short
time, reduce immense quantities. 7

From the foregoing experiments we may perceive, into how
many errors we may be drawn, if, in arguing from the re-
sults which we obtain, we | pronounce too; hastily upon the
state in which a substance exists, in the subject of any analysis. After what has been shewn, with regard to the action of muri-
atic acid upon a mixture of metallic copper and black oxide
of copper, both reduced to powder, and of the action of phos-
phoric acid upon the ore itself, it may be still a doubt, whether
this ore is really a suboxide, or a mixture of metallic copper
and oxide of copper, at 20 per cent. of oxygen. .
