& In the course of my investigations on the Pineal Apparatus of the Tuatara
(Sphenodon punctatus) I have found it desirable to make as complete a study as
& possible of the arrangement of the intracranial arteries and veins, of which no
a description has as yet been published. As any facts relating to the structure of
a Sphenodon are of more than usual interest, and as I hope to be able to give a more
complete account of the subject than has yet been given for any reptile, I have

Ss decided to offer my results for publication as a separate memoir, without waiting for
‘2 the completion of my work on the pineal organs.
2 The blood-vessels have been investigated partly by dissection and partly by means

a of serial sections, and such completeness of detail as I have been able to attain is
a very largely due to the adoption of a method of fixing and hardening which I have
5 found to have many advantages both for the study of the vascular system and of
S the brain itself. By this method the entire contents of the cranial cavity are fixed
s and hardened 7m situ, and are then in excellent condition either for dissection or
