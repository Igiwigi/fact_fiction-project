In [11-14], Davini, Parry and Silhavy searched for ‘invariant integrals’ in the context of the above
kinematical model of defective crystals. These are circuit, closed surface or volume integrals (they
are to mimic atomistic procedures: counting point defects in a given volume; counting edge
dislocations crossing a given surface, for example) with integrands depending on the lattice vector
fields and their derivatives of any order (succinctly, ‘differential functions’) which are functionals
independent of elastic deformation. They are the ‘measures of defectiveness’ referred to in the
Introduction. Thus if Fg ({Iq(-)}) is any such functional, and fields {In(.)} are defined by (2.2), then
Fo({h(-)}) =Fe({I(-)}), with 2 =u(2). This search required discussion of the transformation
properties, induced by (2.2), of the various derivatives of the lattice vector fields, of course—
for example, det({Ia}) = det(Vu) det({la}) together with the definition n = d) - dz A d3 gives that
fyndV= Sven) ii AV is an invariant integral (where det(-) denotes the determinant and V C 2).
In fact,

| n av, | Sn av, | d, - dx are invariant integrals, (3.1)

where C is a circuit, by recalling the definition of the dual fields {d,(-)} and the dislocation density
S, and by calculating relevant transformation properties. As mentioned above, if v is any elastic
invariant (ie. scalar differential function), then

{(I, - Vv)(-)} is a set of elastic invariant fields. (3.2)

As stated, if S has a least one non-constant component, then there is in general an infinite
number of elastic invariants, obtained from that particular component of S by successive
