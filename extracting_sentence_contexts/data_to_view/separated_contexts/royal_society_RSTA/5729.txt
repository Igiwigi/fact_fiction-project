At this point some remarks concerning units is in order. We shall, for the most part, use
geometrized units in terms of which c=G=1, and all dimensioned quantities will have units
of length, ¢, to some power. To convey the fact that a physical quantity 2 has units of ¢* we write
2~t*. In terms of these units, the coordinates t, u, v, w~ ¢! and Sif ~ 0. Consequently 9’ ~09,
and hence for us y ~ £1.
