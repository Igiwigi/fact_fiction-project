OF THE DESTRUCTIVE DISTILLATION OF BOGHEAD COAL. 459

It is submitted that the foregoing experiments prove that the distillate from the
Torbane-hill mineral contains, in addition to several other swbstances, a series of hydro-
carbons having the per-centage composition, density in the fluid and gaseous states, and
also the boiling-point of the alcohol radicals. It is perhaps to be regretted that in
investigating these bodies, we are unable to avail ourselves of active affinities of a kind
tending to yield easily procured and definite compounds, the study of which would
remove all doubt as to identity. It is also peculiarly unfortunate that the boiling-points
of simple and compound radicals, as at present determined, show no fixed law; in fact.
if we examine the only data in our possession on the subject, namely, the numbers given
by Wvurrz, we find no less than nine different values for the increment of C* H?, as may
EÞ seen from the following Tables :—
