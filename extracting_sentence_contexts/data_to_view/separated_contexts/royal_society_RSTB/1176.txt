erroneous character of this view. The nerve fibres in the cord respond to direct exci-
tation, like those in the nerve roots and nerve trunk ; that is to say, nerve impulses,
with their accompanying electrical effects, are propagated in both directions along
any continuous nerve fibres which may exist in the excited area; but, in addition,
complications are introduced by the connection of a large number of the fibres with
nerve cells, this connection causing now a possible decrease in the total electrical
effects, presumably by the blocking of the path and the falling out of certain
impulses, now an increase, presumably by the awakening of cells which lie in the path,
and the accession of fresh impulses generated in these structures. ~We will first state in general terms upon what facts rests our present bisnatiai
# the mode of propagation of nerve impulses, from an excited area of the cord along
e@ntinuous paths to a distant unexcited-area. F(a.)
