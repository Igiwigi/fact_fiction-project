In addition,
more accurately represented thermal effects in the dimensional metrology decreased the
correlation coefficient from —0.58 to —0.63; this has reduced the uncertainty on the final
value of G from 27 to 25 ppm.

2B. Final remarks

In our 2013 paper, we remark that the value then given and that published in 2001 are statistically
independent and that they are also statistically consistent. We also referred to the fact that each is
based on the average of two largely independent methods, the servo and the Cavendish. At the
start of this paper, in describing our method we said: in an experiment in which there are two or more
independent methods, one has first to look for errors in each until they all agree. When this is the case, the
only errors that can remain are those in the much more limited set common to all.
