tests may be considered crucial. Curiously, it was found that though these were the
purest silver obtainable from Messrs. Johnson, Matthey and Co., they were both in
slight degree permanently magnetised. This is in itself an interesting fact. The
torsion system used here is, in this case, a most sensitive magnetometer and when a
N. pole of a bar magnet was brought outside the vacuum, slightly above one silver
sphere, it repelled it, the corresponding scale reading being 4 mm.; whereas when
the N. pole was below, there was a like attraction. This permanent magnetism was °
removed with some difficulty by the passage of a current through a coil round the
yacuum tube, until at last the scale reading was reduced to the small amount of
0°2 mm.
