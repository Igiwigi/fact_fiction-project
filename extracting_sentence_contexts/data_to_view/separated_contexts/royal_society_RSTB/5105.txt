They are all nocturnal. The day-feeding Gecko, Phleuma madagascariensis (Green
Gecko), has a grey fundus, which is rendered a still lighter grey by a dense layer of
superimposed nerve fibres. This fact lends additional support to the above statement. All the Geckos have a large conical pecten which covers the entire disc. The background
is mottled with dark red spots.
