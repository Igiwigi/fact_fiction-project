radiation produced a deflection of 45% When the gas was cut off, the needle returned

accurately to 0?. '
The absorption by a film may be shown by filling the cube with cold water, but not

$0 cold as to produce the precipitation of the aqueous vapour of the atmosphere. A
gilt copper ball, cooled in a freezing mixture, was placed in fronk of the pile, and its
effect was neutralized by presenting a beaker containing a little iced water to the oppo-
Site face of the pile. A film of olefiant gas was sent, over the ball, but the consequent
deflection proved that the absorption, jnstead of being greater, was less than before.
The ball, in fact, had been coated by a crust of ice, which is one of the best absorbers
of radiant heat. The olefiant gas, being warmer than the ice, partially neutralized its
absorption. When, however, the temperature of the ball was only a few degrees lower
than that of the atmosphere, and its surface quite dry, the film of gas was found to act
as a film of varnish; it augmented the absorption.

A remarkable effect, which contributed at first to the complexity of the experiments,
can now be explained. Conceive the experimental tube exhausted and the needle at
zero; conceive a small quantity of alcohol or ether vapour admitted ; it cuts off a
portion of the heat from one source, and the opposite source triumphs. Let the conse-
quent deflection be 45%, If dry air be now admitted till the tube is filled, its effect of
course will be slightly to augment the absorption and make the above deflection greater,
But the following action is really observed :â€”when the air first, enters, the needle,
