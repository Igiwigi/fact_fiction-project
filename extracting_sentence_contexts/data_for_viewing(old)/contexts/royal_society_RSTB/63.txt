Our observations by the galvanometer are in the main confirmatory for the
Mammalian heart of the fundamental facts established on the Frog’s heart by the
researches of ENGELMANN, BurpoN SANDERSON, MarcHanp, and others, but with
certain reservations and amid frequent irregularities, owing to the presumably more
mobile nature of the Mammalian organ. We know already, from the observations of


ACTION OF THE EXCISED MAMMALIAN HEART. 233

Kotiiker and Mitier,* that the spontaneous systole of the Mammalian heart is
accompanied (or rather preceded) by an electromotive change ; to this we have to add
that the electromotive change is frequently diphasic, and entirely similar to the
diphasic variation of the spontaneously beating Frog’s heart. The second chief fact
relating to spontaneous action is that electromotive changes, such as ordinarily belong
to visible contraction, frequently persist in the absence of such visible contractions,
and continue long after these have entirely ceased, 7.¢., invisible molecular changes
outlast visible changes of form.

(a.) Excited contractions.—As regards excited beats, one fundamental result is that
excitation applied near to one of two points, by which any two parts of the excised,
but otherwise uninjured and quiescent, heart are led off to the galvanometer, gives
rise to a diphasic variation the direction of which is such as to indicate (1) negativity
of the proximal electrode ; (2) negativity of the distal electrode. These are the most
important points which we have been able to satisfactorily establish. To these may
be added a fourth statement, viz., the effect of local injury long after the heart has
