of 1° C, far exceed the observed specific heat of the metal. In this theory the electrons
pass from one doublet, consisting of a positively and negatively charged atom, to
another similar doublet, which have arranged themselves along the line of electric
force, as in the-old theory of electrolysis the molecules of the Grotthus chains were
supposed to do, If d is the distance apart of the charges of the doublet, and 6 is the
distance between the doublets, Tomson shows that k/«t is 9b/8a times the value
found on the former theory. Since b/a may vary in value from metal to metal, and
in the same metal at different. temperatures, this theory may by a proper choice of the
laws of variation be brought into unison with the observed facts.

Tt is, however, open to doubt whether any theory which does not take into account
the atomic differences of the various metals can give a satisfactory explanation of the
whole facts. The nearness to each other of the curves for metals belonging to the
same chemical group, Plate 31, suggests that atomic properties play their part in
determining the behaviour of a metal to the flow of heat and electricity through it.

Electronic theories have regarded the free electrons as the sole carriers of energy
from molecule to molecule, and have therefore been unable to deal with the thermal
conductivities of electrical insulators, in which there can be no free electrons. Now
the thermal conductivities of some substances which insulate electrically are as large
as those of the worse conducting metals, e.g., the thermal conductivity of quartz along
the axis is 0°029, while that of bismuth is only 0016 to 0019. It seems, therefore,
that a theory of heat conduction which ascribes it to free electrons alone must be a
very partial account of it.
