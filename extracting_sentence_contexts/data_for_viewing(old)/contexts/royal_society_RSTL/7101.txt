at the summits of the papille are connected together by commissural fibres. Thus in
action the papillz may be associated together. The bearing of this arrangement upon
the existence of complete nervous circuits is discussed in my * Archives,” vol. iv. The
bundle in the central part of the papilla consists of dark-bordered fibres, which frequently
cross and interlace with one another in this part of their course. They vary much in
diameter, some being 80 fine as scarcely to be visible. .

As the bundle passes towards the summit of the papilla, the individual fibres divide
and subdivide into finer branches. Now, as I have before remarked, nerves 80 near
their distribution as these do not usually possess an axis-cylinder as a structure distinct
from the white substance. The white substance does not abruptly cease, while the axis-
cylinder is alone prolonged onwards by itself as is often described, but the entire fibre
divides and subdivides. In fact dark-bordered nerve-fibres, near their ultimate ramifica-
tions, always consist of fatty albuminous material imbedded in a transparent matrix of
connective tissue. The © tubular membrane,” © white substance,” and * axis-cylinder ”
can never be demonstrated as distinct structures near the peripheral distribution of
nerves. The © tubular membrane” is nothing more than the transparent matrix in
which one or more nerve-fibres are imbedded.

The dark-bordered fibres divide into finer fibres about the level of the ring or half-ring
of capillaries at the summit of the papilla. As the fibres are exceedingly transparent,
they are usually lost from view about this point. For example, HarTMANN's figures
convey the idea that distinct dark-bordered fibres can be followed as high as this point,
but that they cannot be traced further. Above this spot the papilla is a little thickened
and the tissue more granular, and hence it is not to be wondered at that great difficulty
