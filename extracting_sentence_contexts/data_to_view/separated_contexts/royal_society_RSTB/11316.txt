But by selecting only
items producing data that match assumptions of statistical
theories and discarding all items that do not, psychometricians
radically match the data generation to statistical theories rather
than to the properties of the actual phenomena under
study. This challenges assumptions on the representativeness
of many personality taxonomies. In fact, adjectives of popular
questionnaires are used with disparate frequencies in online
media [57]. In language, redundancies can be generated at low costs;
therefore, variables can be created ad libitum. But in biologi-
cal systems (e.g. behaviour, physiology), redundancies are
rare probably due to ecological and evolutionary constraints
[4].
