Islands (Dr. SUTHERLAND); and in both dredgings it is rather common and of middling
8ize. Also from Baffin's Bay, lat. 75* 10' N., long. 60” 12' W. (Parry); here it seems to
be rare, but is of large size,—a curious fact, in contrast with the occurrence of equally
large individuals of this variety at very great depths (1080 fathoms) in the tropical
Atlantic (lat. 2 20' N., long. 28* 44' W.).

This also is a world-wide and very common Zagena, as we may s8ee by Table VII.
Professor REvss has it fossil from the Chalk of Maestricht and of Lemberg, from the
