where Ip is the two-dimensional identity tensor in the 12-plane, N(¢) := (V76)Inp — V @ Vo, and
a similar relation holds for N(y). Because of the plane-strain assumption the only non-zero
components of the couple-stress tensor are /4p3 and 43, (9 =1,2), and in (3.4), we have tacitly
assumed that pp = 1413e1 + /423€2 as 431 and 132 do not feature in the equilibrium equations and
can in fact be obtained directly from 113 and j13, respectively (e.g. [12]).

The compatibility conditions for the strain measures (e.g. [10,12]) demand that the stress
functions must satisfy the following set of partial differential equations
