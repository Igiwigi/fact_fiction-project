12 PROF. A. FOWLER ON THE SPECTRUM OF SILICON

Under each symbol the number preceding the +- sign represents the nuclear charge, and
that preceding the — sign the number of external electrons apart from that which
generates the spectrum, so that in the first row the atoms as a whole are neutral. The
atomic numbers of Na, Mg, Al and Si are respectively 11, 12, 13, 14, and the neutral
atoms give spectra consisting alternately of doublets and triplets.* The spectrum of
neutral silicon (Si I) includes triplets and, as shown in the table, the spectrum of ionised
silicon (Si II) may be expected to be similar to that of neutral aluminium (Al I) and to
yield a system of doublets. In the same way, the spectra of Si III and Si IV were
expected to resemble in type the spectra of Mg I and Na I respectively. All spectra in
the same vertical column of the foregoing table should, in fact, be of the same type.
Corresponding lines in the spectra, however, would be expected to be displaced to shorter
wave-lengths as the degree of ionisation is increased, in consequence of the increased
nuclear charge. These predictions have also been realised, as will presently appear.

Series Notation.

The series notation adopted in the present paper is mainly that of the author's ““ Report
on Series,” in which singlet terms are represented by mS, mP, mD, mF, doublets by
mo, mx, m3, md, and triplets by ms, mp, md, and mf. In accordance with more recent
usage, however, the multiple doublet and triplet terms have been modified as follows :—

Doublets. Triplets.
