A little above this comes the driving pulley (9 inches in diameter), and
above this again the screw and nut by which the divided card is held. The top piece
is hollow, forming a tube with an aperture of 1; inches, and is held by a well-fitting
brass collar attached to the upper part of the frame. On this bearing the force is very
8mall, s0 that the considerable relative velocity of the sliding surfaces has no ill effect,
Notwithstanding its great weight, the ring ran very lightly, and the principal resistance
to be overcome was that due to setting air in motion.

it was cut into two equal parts along a horizontal plane.
