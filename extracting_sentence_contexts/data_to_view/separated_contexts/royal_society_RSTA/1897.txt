4, but it may be masked by the errors of observation. In fact, the experimental data
which look most reliable for this part of the curve point to a rising current with rising
negative voltages in those experiments. On the other hand, although the matter was
not explicitly tested at the time the experiments were made, the chlorine data which
form the basis of fig. 7 show, on re-examination, a distinct drooping tendency towards
higher voltages.
