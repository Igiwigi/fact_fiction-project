change in viscosity caused by the introduction of 1 gram-molecule of the ions, we
should have (remembering that according to our theory 7’ = 1/l)

An/C = (1—B) r—7) + B/l.


142 MR. W. R. BOUSFIELD: IONIC SIZE IN RELATION TO
GRUNEISEN’s expression, for the purpose of comparison, may be written
An = —a+b/l.

But according to our view, the value of 8 differs for each ion, and hence GRisNEISEN’s
expression, in which a and b are given constant values for all monovalent ions, could
only approximately represent the general result, and in fact it does not profess to do
more. But the important point is that Griinersen’s empirical result, which brings out
the equivalent viscosity increment of a “normal solution of ions” as approximately
a linear function of the reciprocal of the mobility, is in complete accord with and so
far confirms the general theory of ionic sizes herein set forth.*

Part VI.—Iontc Size in ReLarton To FREEZING-POINT DEPRESSION.

(a) General Considerations.—As is well known, the so-called ‘ molecular” freezing-
point depression, which is normally nearly constant for dilute solutions of non-
electrolytes, varies ‘with the concentration in the case of dilute solutions of
electrolytes, and tends at great dilution to a value which is for binary electrolytes
about double the value for a dilute solution of non-electrolytes. This may partly be
