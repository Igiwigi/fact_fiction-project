Figure 2. Tissue tension and surrounding constraints to contraction influence cytoskeletal organization. (a) Differing constraints that influence cytoskeletal organization
in normally shaped embryos. Red arrows indicate tension. Green illustrates the organization of apical myosin II. (b) The effect of changing embryo shape. Round embryos
have different constraints to contraction resulting in cells having a different cytoarchitecture. Images are embryos stained for eve expression, from [45].

The self-organization of this system arises from the fact a directional bias. Modelling actomyosin contraction has
