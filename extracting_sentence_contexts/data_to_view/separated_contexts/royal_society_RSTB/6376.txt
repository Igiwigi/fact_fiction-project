Similarly, the phenotypic expression of the cruciate
mutation may only be reached in other species when Cr genes already present
are rearranged so that in the zygote they dominate the Cr genes. To determine
whether this is an adequate interpretation of the various cruciate mutations and
their inheritance requires still further investigations. The fact that there is generally
no other difference between the cruciate and broad-petalled races of a particular
species makes it difficult to believe that crossing-over of the ordinary type can be
involved. The occurrence of broad, narrow, and intermediate petals on the same plant, as
well as in different plants of the F, in crosses between wide and narrow petals, is
similar to the hereditary behaviour as regards longer and shorter petals in certain
Oenothera crosses (GATES 1917, 1923). Hybrids of O. biennis x rubricalyx and its
reciprocal were made, O. biennis having petals ca. 20 mm. and O. rubricalyx ca. 40 mm.
in length.
