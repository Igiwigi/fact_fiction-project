This material
again contained 37 % of nucleic acid. These results lead inescapably to the view that the
‘chromosomes’ are identical in composition with the nucleus itself. Ris & Mirsky (1949)
have, indeed, been forced to the conclusion that their ‘chromosomes’ do, in fact, fill the
whole nucleus, a conclusion which, in our view, constitutes a reductio ad absurdum. Evidently
Mirsky & Ris’s threads are not chromosomes. If they were, a dilemma would arise of
the same nature as that caused by the classical view of the composition of cell nuclei,
the resolution of which has been outlined elsewhere (Stedman & Stedman 19474); this
solution still holds.
