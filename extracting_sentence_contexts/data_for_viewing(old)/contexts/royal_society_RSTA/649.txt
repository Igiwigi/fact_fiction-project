I would like to close this section by noting a more general long-term impact of Heisenberg’s
approach on twentieth-century and then twenty-first-century physics. This thinking not only
introduced a new type of mathematical model in physics, which is an epochal achievement
already, but, by the same token, also established a new way of doing theoretical physics. In fact,
it also redefined the practice of experimental physics in quantum regimes, at least as this practice
appears from the non-realist perspective adopted here.

The practice of experimental physics no longer consists, as in classical physics, in tracking
the independent behaviour of the systems considered. Instead, it consists in unavoidably creating
configurations, by now almost unbelievable in their complexity (think of the Large Hadron
Collider, where the Higgs boson was recently discovered), of experimental technology that
reflects the fact that what happens is unavoidably defined by what experiments we perform,
how we interact with quantum objects, rather than only by their independent behaviour.
These configurations, of course, relate to quantum objects. But they embody the effects of
the interactions between quantum objects and measuring instruments, through which effects
quantum objects are defined and, when possible, distinguished from one another, while always
remaining beyond the reach of quantum theory and even thought. I emphasize ‘unavoidably’
above because, while the behaviour of classical objects is sometimes affected by experimental
technology, in general, as Bohr stressed, we can observe classical physical objects without


appreciably affecting them, or else we can compensate for this interference so that we can describe
classical objects independently. This does not appear possible in quantum experiments.
