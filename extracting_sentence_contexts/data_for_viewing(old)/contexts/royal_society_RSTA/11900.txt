the appearance of an ordinary photograph of the eclipsed sun which is slightly
distended in the direction of dispersion. The various prominences each show three
images, two of which were identified with H,, H,, while the others were found to
correspond to a wave length of about 3957.
It was suggested (Report, p. 149) that this represented the H and K radiations of
calcium, and this is fully confirmed by the results obtained in 1893, to say nothing
a of results obtained in other eclipses.
S In addition to the protuberances, the photographs show a well defined circular
* boundary of the moon’s limb at a position corresponding to H,. This was considered
= to be an indication that hydrogen was one of the substances existing in an incan-
= descent state in the corona itself, for although coronal rings corresponding to H,
a Pied H; were not photographed, their absence may possibly be accounted for by the
> fact that the plates employed were most sensitive to the H, region.
© There are also indications. of a continuous spectrum teas the lower parts of the
2’ corona, shown by well defined structure running parallel to the direction of
Sb dispersion.
a I next, proceed to remark very briefly upon the photographic results obtained
3 since 1875.
S In 1878, near the sun-spot minimum, the method was employed by several
‘8 observers, myself among them, but no bright rings were recorded. The maximum
z sun-spot conditions previously observed had entirely changed ; indeed with a slit
& spectroscope the 1474 line was very feeble, and was only seen by a few of the
observers, and hydrogen lines were similarly feeble.*
= Part of my own equipment for this eclipse consisted of a small grating placed in
¢ front of an ordinary portrait camera, and with this I obtained a photograph showing
