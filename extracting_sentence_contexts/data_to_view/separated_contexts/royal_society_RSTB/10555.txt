Consistent with this notion, Bax/Bak-induced
Drp1 SUMOylation at the ER/mitochondria interface stabil-
izes signalling platforms for calcium and lipid transfer
between both organelles, as well as for cristae remodelling
and cytochrome c release [30,71,114]. To date, several contradictory studies challenge the interplay The current data available support two alternative models
between the alterations occurring at the mitochondria during for the role of Drp1 in apoptosis: (i) Drp1-mediated cristae
