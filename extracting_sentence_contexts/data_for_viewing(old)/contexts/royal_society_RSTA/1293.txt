technologies, occurs when evaporating liquid droplets enter a heated gaseous environment.
Here, such systems as evaporative cooling and spray drying may be mentioned as examples
of technologically important processes [23,24]. It is important to note that the dynamics of these
processes is determined by the features of heat and mass transfer at the phase transition interfaces
of liquid drops, which characterize their evaporation rates. In this article, we analyse the kinetics
of evaporation of a polydisperse ensemble of liquid drops into a vapour-gas medium, as well as
their cooling by analogy with the previously developed analytical theory of bulk crystallization
of polydisperse crystals in a supercooled liquid [25-33]. Following these studies, we suggest that
liquid droplets do not interact with each other and retain their spherical shape at all stages of
evaporation. We also consider the intermediate stage of evaporation (far from the final stages,
when the disintegration and agglomeration of particles play an important role) and suggest
that the saturated vapour pressure is independent of the radius of the decreasing droplets. A
significantly simplifying assumption is the fact that the droplet temperature can be considered a
constant value due to the rapid relaxation of the thermal field. Let us especially emphasize that
these model assumptions can describe many evaporation processes met in reality.

2. Governing equations

Let us consider the model of evaporation process that takes into account the fluctuations in
particle evaporation rates by means of the additional term in the Fokker-Planck equation
for the population density distribution function (the term containing the second spatial
derivative) [1]
