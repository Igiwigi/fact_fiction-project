The « must be
‘ itself a solid solution, but we are strongly disposed to think that § is the compound
z Cu,Sn. The alloy Sn 20, although the cooling curve indicates that it undergoes a
= well-marked exothermic transformation at the D’ temperature, remains substantially

# shown in the ingots chilled below D’, by minute traces of the C’ eutectic visible
q between the large crystals of § that almost entirely fill the ingot. It may be that
& the chemical compound Cu,Sn does not exist above the temperature D’. 2  (5.)
