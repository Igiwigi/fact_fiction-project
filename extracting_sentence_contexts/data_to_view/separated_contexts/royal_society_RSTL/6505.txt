contains the values given by the whole length, from London
to Hastings. They differ but little, save in one or two instances, from the Tonbridge-
Hastings values; and are consequently very low in comparison with the Tonbridge-
London values. These facts all indicate the yery notable influence of local conditions,
other than the meteorological variation already noted, over the relative value of the
current in different parts of the plane. It was a matter of considerable importance to determine with certainty whether the
currents with which I was dealing were in whole, or only in part, earth-currents;
whether, that is, any portion of the observed deflections of the galvanometer needle
were due to electricity collected from the atmosphere by the suspended telegraph wires
that were employed in these observations. To determine this I availed myself of the
assistance of Ashford.
