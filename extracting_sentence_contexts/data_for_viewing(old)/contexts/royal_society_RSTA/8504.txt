be found in Part IT. Foix also considers in considerable detail the possible phenomena
shown by the mean of the principal susceptibilities, z.e., the quantity determined by
measurements on powdered materials. He shows that the theory predicts the existence
of the following phenomena: (1) At the higher temperatures the Wextss law holds,
(2) at the lower temperatures the susceptibility may increase either more rapidly or
less rapidly with fall in temperature than is given by the Wetss law, (3) the curve of the
reciprocal of the susceptibility against the absolute temperature may possess a point
of inflection so that the curve changes from concave towards the temperature axis to
convex and vice versa, (4) a maximum and a minimum of susceptibility may occur at
the lowest temperatures. It will thus be seen that the theory covers all the phenomena
found as yet, including those announced in the previous pages. Foix’s theory is,
however, purely qualitative, so that it cannot be asserted with any certainty that the
theory is really a true representation of the facts.

The earliest of the theories of paramagnetism based on the quantum theory is that
of OosrErHuIs}. The susceptibility according to LANGEvIN’s is inversely proportional
to the kinetic energy of rotation of the molecules. OosTERHUIS replaces the classical
expression for this energy by the quantum expression given by HinsTern and STern§
