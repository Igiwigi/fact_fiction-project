in contemporary astrophysics, ranging from the formation, assembly and evolution of
galaxies to the details of the star-formation process. Our improved understanding of the
physics driving star cluster formation and evolution has led to the emergence of crucial
new open questions that will most probably be tackled in a systematic way in the next
decade.

1. Our improved understanding of star cluster physics

It is now widely accepted that stars do not form in isolation, at least for
stellar masses above approximately 0.5 Mo. In fact, 70-90% of stars may form
in a clustered mode (cf. Lada & Lada 2003). Star formation results from the
fragmentation of molecular clouds, which in turn preferentially leads to star
cluster formation. Over time, clusters dissolve or are destroyed by interactions
with molecular clouds or tidal stripping by the gravitational field of their host
galaxy. Their member stars become part of the general field stellar population.
Star clusters are thus among the basic building blocks of galaxies. Star cluster
populations, from young associations and open clusters to old globular clusters,
are therefore powerful tracers of the formation, assembly and evolutionary history
of their host galaxies.

Using our improved understanding of star cluster physics, we are now
within reach of answering a number of fundamental questions in contemporary
