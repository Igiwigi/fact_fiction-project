For very short trains consisting of a single particle
the ratio D/A for wild-type cells by fitting the dependence per train, the probability of observing tubulin signal associ-
of flagellar length as a function of flagellar number in ated with the train is thus 50%. For slightly larger trains
mutants with variable numbers of flagella [21]. That analysis consisting of two particles, the fact that the train now contains
suggested that the ratio D/A was in the range 6-8. Taking the two binding sites for tubulin means that there are four possible

high end of this range, and dividing D/A by the fold increase binding states, three of which would be detected as a tubulin
