The conjectured value Q;(q,d) nicely
fits the actual data M;(q,d), spectacularly well in some cases. The sheer number, q/ — q*—!, of polynomials D € ya makes it prohibitive to compute the
moments M,(q,d) for d large, at least if we do so one D at a time. One can slightly reduce
the amount of computation for the moments by taking advantage of the fact that many D
have the same zeta functions, see §4. The largest value of d for which we determined moments.
was d= 18 and q=3. Our data support Andrade and Keating’s conjecture in the sense that, for given q (size of field),
and k, the ratio between the actual moment M,(q,d) and their prediction Q;(q,d) does appear to
tend to 1 as d grows.
