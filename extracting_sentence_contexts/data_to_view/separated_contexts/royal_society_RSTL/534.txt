376 Dr. HerscnEL's Account of the Changes that have happened

remarkable a star as « should have a companion, seems almost
to amount to a proof that this very companion is, as it appears
to be, a connected star. The onus probandi, therefore, ought in
justice to fall to the share of those who would deny the truth of
what we may call a fact; and I believe the utmost they could
do, would be to prove that we may be deceived; but they cannot
show that this star has no connection with e Bootis. This argument will be much supported, when we consider that
many of the double stars in the milky-way are probably such
as have one of the scattered stars, nearly in the same line, at a
great distance behind them. In this case, the two stars of the
double star have no connection with each other; and the great
number of them in the milky-way, is itself an indication of this
effect of the scattered multitude of small stars.
