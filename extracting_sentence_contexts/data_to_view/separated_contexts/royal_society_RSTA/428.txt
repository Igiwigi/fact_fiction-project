(d) Preparation of steel surfaces for grit friction tests. (i) It was found that the tests made using
the same surface continuously either on the wheel or plate, or both, for a number of strikes,
were unreliable, whenever grit was used, owing to the fact that the roughness increased
progressively. (ii) The wheel must in all cases be smoother than the plate, since otherwise the composition
is merely brushed off the smoother surface, and a low sensitiveness observed.
