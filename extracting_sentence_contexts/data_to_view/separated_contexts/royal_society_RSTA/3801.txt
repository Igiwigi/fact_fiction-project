Since, in the application of these integrals, the vanishing
of « implies the vanishing of 8, we appear to be met by a difficulty. It is known
that in spheroidal analysis no such terms appear, and we may feel confident that
they cannot really exist in ellipsoidal analysis. In § 20 it is proved that the
logarithmic terms do as a fact disappear. The residues of the integrals in the cases
s = 1, 0 are thus found, and added to the previous portions to form the complete
results. The second part of the paper ends (§ 22) with a list of the integrals of the squares
of the surface harmonies for all values of s, as far as the squares of £.
