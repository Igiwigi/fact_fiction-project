and in another standard work, Professor Owen's © Comparative Anatomy of Vertebrates,”
the only fact noticed regarding the muscles of the Bats is their deep red colour (vol. iii.
P-1). No extensive series of observations has hitherto been made on this subject; a
few species only have been dissected with care, and these dissections have not even been
compared with each other. Cuvier, MECKEL, IKOLENATI, HUMPHREY, and AEBY are among
the only authors who have published records of their researches, and not more than four
or five species have been made the snbjects of description.

On examining some of the store jars in the Museum of the Dublin University, I found
some $8pecimens of Bats which proved on examination to be in yery good dissectable
condition. During the past summer I made a very careful series of dissections of these,
and have from them compiled the present Monograph. The number of perfectly new
and remarkable facts which have, in the course of my examinations, been observed and
recorded, will, I think, fully justify me in publishing a detailed account of my dissec-
tions.

The small size of some of these animals rendered the dissection a matter of difficulty,
as in many cases I was obliged to use a simple dissecting-microscope. For the same
reason I was not able to use the balance with any degree of comfort, as a means of com-
paring the relative development of muscles in different species; I was, indeed, compelled
to give up the use of this aid to investigation, as, from the small sizes and the necessary
difficulty in raising entire muscles with the degree of absolute perfection requisite in the
comparison of such small weights as grains or fractions of grains, the work became
almost hopelessly tedious; and thus I have very little additional light to throw upon this
interesting subject, whose study has been begun by Professor ArBy in Basel and Pro-
