served to equalise the temperature, and to hold them together. They were then placed
on two crescents of asbestos which fitted the inside of the furnace, and maintained
them symmetrically in the centre of the cylinder, equidistant from its sides. The
two halves, in which the electric furnace was made, were now drawn together over the
tubes, and the junction carefully packed with asbestos, a thermometer, for rough
observations of temperature, being inserted with its bulb in contact with the glass
of the tubes at their middle point, which was usually the coolest portion of the
system. Finally, the whole was adjusted between the mirrors of the refractometer

till interference bands could be seen in the field of the telescope. A pointer was
hung on the mirror furthest from the eye to mark the zero of observation,

* This adjustment is necessary owing to the fact that it is very difficult to grind a stopper so truly that
the axis of the cone which it forms is accurately at right angles to the plane of the plate.

The tube which remained in connection with the pump was then exhausted, and
the height of the mercury in the manometer noted. The observer, having taken his
seat at the telescope and noted the position of the bands, turned on the electric
current. The tubes slowly warmed, and in about an hour had reached a temperature
of 270°C. As the substance grew hot it began to volatilize, and the bands which
