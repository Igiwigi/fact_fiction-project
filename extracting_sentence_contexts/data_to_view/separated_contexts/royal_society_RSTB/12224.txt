We first suggest that the
clustering and temporally organized alternation between
spindles and associated refractory periods during NREM
stage 2 sleep are essential for efficient reactivation and
interference-free reprocessing and consolidation of motor
memories [24,56] (see [23] for evidence in relation to
declarative memories). More specifically, we conjecture that
spindle-related memory reactivations follow two periodic
rhythms that can be decomposed into a 0.02 Hz infraslow
periodicity of spindle ‘trains’ and a 0.2-0.3Hz mesoscale
rhythm for the iterative and region-specific occurrence of
sleep spindles within trains. We further highlight the fact
that such neurophysiological events show a topographical
distribution over cortical and subcortical structures involved
during the initial learning phase, and that their temporally
coordinated occurrence is assumed to reflect synchronized
oscillatory activity (functional connectivity) across multiple
learning-specific brain regions and associated integration of
new information into pre-existing knowledge structures. At
the systems level, it is then suggested that oscillatory

synchrony in the 11-16 Hz spindle frequency band underlies
the cross-structural reactivation, reorganization and consoli-
dation of memory traces within subcortical-cortical
networks involving the hippocampus, striatum, thalamus
and motor-related cortical regions for sequential motor mem-
ories [5,18,19], and potentially, the hippocampus and other
cortical regions that were activated during the acquisition
phase in the case of declarative memories. Altogether, we
thus argue that the integrity of the mechanisms supporting
the synchronization and interaction of brain rhythms
during sleep is fundamental to the proper consolidation
and long-term storage of coherent memory representations.
