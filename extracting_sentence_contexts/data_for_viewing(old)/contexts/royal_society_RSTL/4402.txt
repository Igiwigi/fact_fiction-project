$ British Association Reports, 1841, p. 91. The eminent author appears however to have entertained some
doubts whether the appropriation was correct, and the vertebra in question might not belong to his genus
« Cetiosaurus ;” but he dismisses the suspicion with the remark, * that the general constancy of the vertebra

of the same Saurian in their antero-posterior diameter forbids the suppoxition of a vertebra 6 inches in length
in the neck, being associated with one 3 inches in length in the back,” p. 96.


274 DR. MANTELL ON THE OSTEOLOGY OF

tation of these vertebra in my subsequent geological works#, yet I could not divest
myself of the idea that this inference might be erroneous, from the fact that all the
convexo-concave vertebrz of the Wealden were cervical ; it was indeed this circum-
stance, and the extreme rarity of this type, which deterred the Rev. W. D. ConvBears
and myself, at the very commencement of my exploration of the Wealden, from
aszigning them to the Iguanodon-F.

The inspection of a large anterior dorsal yertebra of the conyexo-concave system,
recently obtained by me from the Isle of Wight (Plate XXVIII. fig. 5), first suggested
to Dr. MeLviLLe the idea that. this bone, as well as the cervicals above described,
belonged to the Iguanodon ; and he has spared neither time nor trouble to determine
the correctness of this solution of the problem. To him, therefore, alone is due the
credit of having first correctly interpreted the characters of this important part of
the skeleton, should future discoveries confirm our present view of the subject.
