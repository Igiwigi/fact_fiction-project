If the same series of changes is repeated with an observer of class IL, the results
obtained are quite different. At fairly high intensities there seems little difference
between the centre and the sides in colour, though the centre generally seems slightly

observer of class I. there is no sensation of light in the centre, an observer of class IT.
sees a continuous streak of light, the brightness at the centre being little less than
that at the sides. If the intensity is reduced to about one-twentieth of that
required for central extinction for class I., the centre also appears dark for class IT.,
but the sides then are very faint, in fact the threshold is almost reached throughout.

Tf a red (SSN 50, 632u‚Äù) spot of light is used, then for both classes the streak of
light looks brighter at the centre than at the sides, whatever the intensity.

"The explanation of these results is that with the green light, which stimulates
both the rods and the cones if sufficiently bright, when the intensity is reduced below
the cone threshold in the case of class I. (where there are no rods at the fovea), no
sensation is produced in this region. In the periphery, where there are rods, the
stimulus is sufficient to cause the sensation of light. In the case of class IL., since
there are rods at the fovea, the stimulus even when below the cone threshold is
sufficient to cause a sensation of light by means of these rods. With a red light,
since this colour is unable to stimulate the rods, we have only to do with cone
