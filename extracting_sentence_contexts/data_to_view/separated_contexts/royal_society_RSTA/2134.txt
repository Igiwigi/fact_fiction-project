characters 0-1, one had even 0-0. The fact is that the size of the character figure was
not in all cases the only criterion taken into account at De Bilt in the selection of Q days. For instance, XXIV, 1 (September 13, 1921), with character 0-1, isa Q day, while XXIV,
14 (September 26), with character 0-0, is not. But September 24 and 25 also had
character 0-0, and to have had three successive days, coming near the end of the month,
all Q days would have led to a rather unbalanced choice.
