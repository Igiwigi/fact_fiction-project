There are three different structures of the. membranes of
the foetus for, this purpose ; one of these-is the whole of the
foetal membrane next the uterus, being extremely vascular,
as in the horse and ass ; the second, is having only particular
portions of it loaded with blood vessels, as in the deer; the
third, is having only one large mass, into; which: the Å¿cetal
blood vessels pass to a certain depth, beyond which is a cel-
Jular structure, filled with blood from the arteries of the uterus,
and taken up by the uterine veins, $0 that in this instance,
there is a greater mass. of blood belonging to the mother,
nearly in contact with the fetal blood, than in other-animals..

From the series of facts which has been detailed, it appears,
that oxygen is essentially necessary for the action of the

vivifying principle in all classes of animals ; and that it is not
simply applied to the blood, but mixed with that fluid while
circulating in the arteries, since, if this were not the case,
there would be no means of aerating the foetal blood in the
higher orders of animals.
