It has also been shown that

an adult female will calve at an average interval of approximately 4 years, or rather less,

and the probable sequence of events in the individual has been discussed. In relation to

the population as a whole it seems safe to assume that each adult female will produce a calf

every 4 years on an average, and it has been shown that puberty is reached at an age of

about 10 years. The average life span remains a matter for conjecture, but conservation

measures can be based on an estimated average life span, and an estimated or counted
total population, taken in conjunction with the facts just quoted. The relation of tusk growth to age is another characteristic of interest in relation to

administrative policy. Work by the author (in preparation) has shown that the rate of growth

of tusks varies enormously in different males, and that large tusks usually indicate rapid



140 J.
