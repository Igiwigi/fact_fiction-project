Even should the exact position of the worked flints at Hoxne prove
to be above all the bone-bearing beds, and not in them, still that they are contem-
poraneous with an old condition of surface, and that over the whole is spread a drift
concomitant with a modification of that surface, and giving the stamp to some of the
present minor features of the country, is in either case, a very remarkable fact.

$ 6. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS. From the foregoing considerations I cannot do otherwise, concerning the material facts,
than come to the conclusions, agreeing essentially with M. Bovcuer DE PuRrTHEs and
Dr. R1i60LLOTF, thatâ€”

1st. The flint-implements are the result of design and the work of man.

2ndly. That they are found in beds of gravel, sand, and clay which have never been
artificially disturbed.
