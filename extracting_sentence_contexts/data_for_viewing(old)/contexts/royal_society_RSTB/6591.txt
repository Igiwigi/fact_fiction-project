anus and renal openings, it is probably made by inhibition of mantle and consequently
of shell growth, due to the stream of poisoned water. The mantle can only grow together
again when out of the range of this current. In Haliotis the outgoing current is vertical
and there is alternate splitting and closing of the mantle margin as the pallial cavity
grows forwards. The description of the development of Haliotis shows that the first
shell hole actually does appear at the close of metamorphosis and, moreover, the final
right ctenidium develops only at about the same time. The “sanitary” arrangements
during the intervening period after the formation of the first ctenidium may be presumed
to resemble those of the members of the Archaeogastropoda, which have a single
ctenidium supplied by fresh water from under the left shell margin. After use, the
water passes away above the anus on the right side of thespallial cavity.

The fact that the topographical right ctenidium and the hypobranchial gland of
that side, which secretes mucus to clean the respiratory chamber, do not appear until
a month later than those organs of the definitive left side appears to be significant.
Both ctenidia in Haliotis are bipectinate, whereas in Scissurella the definitive left one
is monopectinate; in the adult Haliotis, as in Pleurotomaria and Scissurella, the definitive

right ctenidium is invariably somewhat smaller than the left one, and this difference in
size also applies to the hypobranchial glands.

Two equal-sized ctenidia are never present in prosobranchs with asymmetrically
