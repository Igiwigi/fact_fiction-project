(136). It is, in
the magnetic case, the same as (188); that is, it reduces to the latter when the
medium is kept at rest, so that J, and @, become J and G. -

It is of the simple type in case of isotropy (constant tensor), but is a rotational
stress in general, as indeed are all the statically probable stresses that suggest
themselves. The translational force due to it being divisible conveniently into (a)
the electromagnetic force on electric current, (b) the ditto on the fictitious electric
current taking the place of intrinsic magnetisation, (c) force depending upon space-
variation of »; we see that the really striking part is (b). Of all the various ways of
representing the forcive on an intrinsic magnet it is the most extreme. The magnetic
“matter” does not enter into it, nor does the distribution of magnetisation ; it is

where the intrinsic force hy has curl that the translational force operates, usually on
