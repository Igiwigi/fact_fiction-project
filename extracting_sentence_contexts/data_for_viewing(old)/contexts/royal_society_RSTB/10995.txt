both at day 2 and 10, and the separation between wild-type
and HIBCH overexpression strains was only observed at
day 10 (electronic supplementary material, figure S5). As men-
tioned earlier, BCAA contents differ to a greater or lesser
degree, between transgenic lines and wild-type, and in particu-
lar, Ile is much higher in the PCC1 mutant at day 6. Although
we did not analyse the protein levels of PCC1, accumulation
of Ile in the PCC1 mutant is in agreement with the downregu-
lation of PCC1. PCC1 silencing slowed down BCAA
degradation, but did not result in BCAA accumulation
in cells at day 10, and HIBCH overexpression promoted
BCAA degradations. The phenotypes in these transgenic
strains account for the fact that knockdown of PCC increases
propionyl-CoA oxidation to acrylyl-CoA and eventually
to acetyl-CoA. HIBCH, encoded by a single-copy gene in
P. tricornutum, plays a key role in this oxidation pathway. In
addition, serine, which can be metabolized to the intermediate
of Ile degradation (S)-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate [32], was also
increased by 31% at day 6 in the PCC1 mutant, but decreased
by 23-47% in the two HIBCH overexpression strains (electronic
supplementary material, Data S3). Alanine (Ala), phenyl-
alanine (Phe) and glutamate (Glu) were increased by 55%,
140% and 102%, respectively, in the PCC1 mutant at day 6,
and accordingly these amino contents tended to decrease in
HIBCH overexpression strains (figure 3 and electronic sup-
