£G,] and M the point where the parallel of Beachy Head to
the perpendicular at G cuts that meridian. Then, from the
above values of GM and BM, it will be found, that the latitude
of B is 1”,0g less than the latitude of M, and that too on any
hypothesis of the earth's figure. Therefore, the distance in feet,
between the parallels of B and G, is 269g28 + 103=269431.

Now it has been shown, in the volume above referred to, (see
page 522,) that the meridional distance between D and B is
the mean of the two numbers 44258,6 and 44258,9 feet; and it
must be remembered that, in deducing those conclusions, re-
course was not had to matters of assumption, but to matters of
fact, which were, the observed directions of the two meridians
PD, PB, and the distance DB. Therefore, if 44259 feet be
taken for the meridional distance between D and B, we shall
have 269431 + 44259 = 313690 feet, for the space between
the parallels of latitude of Greenwich and Dunnose.*

® In the Phil. Trans, for 1800, (see note to page 641,) in finding the value of the

oblique arc between Black Down, in Dorsetshire, and Dunnose, I have used the

expression ——= =d; where d is the length of the required degree, þ that of
