And, if this is 80, may it not be that those contractile tissues
which in the higher animals manifest rhythmic action are the contractile tissues which
have longest retained their primitive endowment of rhythmicality ? To my mind it
seers hard to decide in what respect the beating of a Snail's heart differs from that of
the pulsatile yesicles of the Infusoria ; and T do not think ib would be much easier to
decide in what essential respect it differs from the beating of the Mammalian heart. The mere fact that the presence of ganglia can be proved in the one case and nob in
the other, seems to me scarcely to justify the conclusion that the rhythm is in the one
cage wholly dependent, and in the other as wholly independent, of the ganglia. At
any rate, this fact, if it is a fact, is not of 80 self-evident a character as to recommend
to us the current theory of ganglionic action on @ priori grounds. (7.)
