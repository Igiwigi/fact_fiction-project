2. Partial docking of a submarine

There was a need to replace a (rather large) propeller of a submarine. At that time, only a floating
dock was available, but it was too small to elevate her. I suggested the submarine trimming by the
dock, to have her stern above the water. The Fleet Technical Service officials strictly forbade such
an extraordinary operation. Nevertheless, E. A. Smirnov, the chief of the plant, saying ‘it was a
bad telephone connection’, took responsibility. The docking with the propeller replacement was
successfully performed during half of a day. My first paper published in a journal [1] reflected
this operation.

Much later, I was told that the analytical and practical considerations given in the paper were
used at the St Petersburg Marine Technical State University in lectures on ship repair. The article
also differs from my others by the fact that it was the one and only one (except the books) for
which I received a fee.

3. Simple improvements

(a) How uncomplicated mathematics can help

In the research institute where I worked after the Academy, dynamic velocities of structures
under pressure waves were measured using inductive sensors. The sensor was a cylinder with
an inductive coil containing a mass ona spring inside it. The oscillogram showed the speed of the
cylinder (attached to the structure) relative to the mass. In an initial period, the speed of the mass
was negligible, and this allowed one to observe the movement of the structure. However, in the
following, the motion of the mass cannot be neglected, and only the initial part of the oscillogram
