By organizing the research output of an entire community
into a shared structure, integrative simulations have the
potential to advance biological thinking significantly.
Rather than being replacements for existing theoretical or
experimental techniques, these composite simulations
should be viewed as powerful tools to augment the thought
process and technical toolbox of scientists. Figure 3 summar-
izes how integrative simulations can be an organic part of the
research process. The same observations that researchers use
to form mental models and hypotheses are first organized
into databases such as PyOpenWorm and ChannelWorm
(arrow a). Researchers benefit from these databases directly,
for example, by having on-demand access to useful facts
about C. elegans physiology (arrows b and c). Subsequently,
these datasets are formalized into mathematical models, a
process that is itself intrinsically valuable to researchers as
part of hypothesis generation (arrow e). Most significant are
the final steps of this sequence, in which the datasets and
mathematical models are integrated into a larger, composite
simulation. By studying the outputs of simulations, analo-
gous to the outputs of experiments, researchers are able to
augment their intuition and mental models about biological
function in ways that would not be possible through
experimentation alone (arrows f and g).
