If that were the case, how- seem to provide evidence about the nature of the represen-

some findings. Thus, if traditional wisdom were to be taken
seriously, errors with arithmetical facts after lesions of the
dominant hemisphere would be due to a disturbance to
devoted retrieval mechanisms or stored representations [8].
