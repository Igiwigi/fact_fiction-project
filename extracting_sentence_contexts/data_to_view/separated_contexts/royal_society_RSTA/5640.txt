New dynamical charges are created during
the evolution that partially screen the electric field. However, the electric field oscillates coherently and may form an anti-
string (cyan wiggly line), creating a central core of strongly correlated bosons that is very different from an equilibrium state. This strange central region survives despite the fact that the boson density in the central region may be depleted through the
radiation of lighter mesons that can propagate freely. (c) Dynamics of the electric field Gd ) and the dynamical charge (Q), and

The BSM is described by relativistic scalar bosons coupled to an U(1) gauge field in one
dimension. The discretized Hamiltonian of the BSM is given by (see [37] for details)
