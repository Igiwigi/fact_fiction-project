The most notable of
them is the mechanism consisting of a pair of bevil wheels mounted in a frame, the

formula for this would be Ox«WBO(a + 8).

* The formule for plane mechanisms may be made to give information about the length of the links
by inserting figures between the letters which represent the motions. Thus 02'08'UI may be considered
to represent a crank and connecting-rod engine of 4 stroke, the length of the connecting-rod being
twice the stroke, and the line of stroke passing through the axis of the rotating crank. If the line of
stroke were to deviate by the amount of, say 1’, the fact could be indicated in the formula by 02’08'U1'I,
one of the infinite links being 1’ greater than the other. PROFESSOR T. A.
