If not, what are the ontological categories
that are needed to describe quantum systems? In the case of gauge theories such as general
relativity and Yang-Mills theories, the fundamental role played by (local) symmetries seems to
challenge the idea according to which indiscernible configurations should be simply—as Leibniz
famously argued in the correspondence with Clarke [20]—identified (see §4 below). In particular,
are gauge symmetries a mechanism to control the representational redundancy associated with
the existence of different coordinate systems or do they encode some deep fact about the ‘logic
of nature’ [21]? Are gauge symmetries just the consequence of a mathematical ‘surplus structure’

Since any definition is an identity, identity itself cannot be defined’ [5, p. 80].


(Redhead) [22], a mere ‘descriptive fluff’ (Earman) [23]? Can we simply get rid of these ‘ghosts’
(Wigner) [24] or do they play a fundamental role that has yet to be properly understood?
