Sections of these enamel caps stain throughout, and exhibit the
same complicated pattern described in the prisms of the completed tooth near the
dentine. From these appearances, I think, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the
tubes have a calcifying function, conveying the lime salts to the organic foundation
substance of the enamel, The stained spaces in the unerupted tooth are enormously
wider than the largest tubes of the enamel; they must be, therefore, spaces of
incomplete calcification into which these tubes lead. The explanation of these
appearances is, I think, to be found in the different stages of development seen in the
enamel organ of these fish, and to the fact that the pellicle of the enamel organ,
which, as I shall presently show, has in its later stages a free supply of blood-vessels,
remains attached to the surface of the enamel until it is actually fully erupted and
in wear,
