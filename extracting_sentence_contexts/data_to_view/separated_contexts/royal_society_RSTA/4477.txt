Trans.,’ A, vol. 206, pp. 481-507. It is only necessary, before giving a table of the results, to call attention to the fact
that in all cases the ‘ solution-leak correction,” that is, the amount of calcium ferro-
cyanide which came through the membrane during the experiment, is practically
negligible. The amount coming through was determined by evaporating the water
contents of the tubes together with 100 ¢.c. washing water passed through the tube
after an interval of four days, down to a small bulk, and determining the calcium in
it by the oxalate method. It should be mentioned that the solutions act on the gunmetal of the osmotic
apparatus ; this was prevented by coating the metal with a varnish.
