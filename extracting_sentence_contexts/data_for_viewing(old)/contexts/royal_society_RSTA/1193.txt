Figure 2. Glassy states in biological membranes. Areas of non-Brownian dynamics of lysenin toxin on supported lipid bilayers
identified by HS-AFM topographic movies. The different time-lags show variation of the (a) variance (V) of the distribution
of height changes (false colour scale: 0 < V <2nm) and (b) kurtosis (K) (non-Gaussianity) of the distribution of the height
changes (false colour scale: 2.5 < K < 5.0). Adapted from [73]. (Online version in colour.)

as is the case if phase transitions occur, or as a molecular clock that ticks at the pace of ageing
of collective phenomena. As a matter of fact, some molecular trajectories detected in living
cells, described using the formalism of continuous-time random walk [76], which considers a
continuous distribution of waiting times between trajectory steps, could be due to the diffusion of
the molecules in a glassy state [77]. Future experiments may allow us to observe other properties
of glassy systems, such as ageing, that may lead to the description of the membrane as a glassy
mosaic model.

(iv) Protein self-assembly during fission membrane remodelling

The potential of HS-AFM technology transformed our understanding of protein self-assembly in
membranes. During membrane remodelling, there are—generally speaking—two sorts of events,
fusion and fission, which give rise to topological changes. The topological invariant is described
by the Euler number, which is decreased during fusion, when two vesicles merged, or increased
