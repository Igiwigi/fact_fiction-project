When this substance is heated, it first evolves water and then oxygen, leaving a
black powder, to the nature of which I shall recur. By a very high temperature (full
white heat) it is totally reduced to the metallic state. The analyses of this hydrated oxide when first performed led to very irreconcile-
able results, owing to two circumstances,â€”lst, that the oxide of palladium is by no
means $0 easily reduced to the metallic state by the mere agency of heat as has been
snpposed ; and 2nd, that although the precipitation of the hydrated oxide is accom-
panied with the disengagement of much carbonic acid, yet the precipitate always
contains some traces of that acid; it effervesces very distinctly when dissolved in
dilute muriatic acid, and is in fact a highly basic carbonate of palladium, rather than
a true hydrated protoxide. The following details of the experiments made as to its
composition, will place these circumstances in evidence. A. 53-524 grains of a specimen which had been carefully washed until the liquors
ceased to react alkaline, were gently heated over the flame of a spirit-lamp, until no
more traces of water were evolved.
