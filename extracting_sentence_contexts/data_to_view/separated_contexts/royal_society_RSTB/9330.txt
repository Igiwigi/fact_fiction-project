Cole followed with the same recommendation in
2009 [71] and some fingerprint experts start to come to the
same conclusion [72]. A proper evaluation of the findings
calls for an assignment of two probabilities. The ratio between
these two probabilities gives all the required information that
allows discriminating between the two propositions at hand
and the fact finder to take a stand on the case. This approach
is what is generally called the Bayesian framework [73]. Noth-
ing prevents its adoption for fingerprint evidence.
