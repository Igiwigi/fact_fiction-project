As € +1> 2¢ > e, the optimal value of
SOC is C(e + 1). Thus, the worst case efficiency of a variational equilibrium is at most 2¢/(¢ + 1). Letting ¢ decrease to zero reveals that the worst case efficiency is in fact zero, implying that the
variational equilibrium and hence the generalized Nash equilibrium can be arbitrarily inefficient. Finally, note that letting « approach unity shows that efficiency arbitrarily close to unity is also
achievable by a variational equilibrium. Hence the best case efficiency of the variational and
generalized Nash equilibrium is indeed unity.
