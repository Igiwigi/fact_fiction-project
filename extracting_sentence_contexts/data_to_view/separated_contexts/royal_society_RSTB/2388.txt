We shall therefore be prepared to consider the following main divisions of the
Ferns, based upon the characters of the sorus, but supported by collateral lines of
evidence : (1) Those with simultaneous origin of the sporangia in the sorus, which
may be designated Simplices ; (2) those with a regular basipetal succession, which
may be called Gradate; and (3) those in which the various ages are irregularly
intermixed, the Miate. It will be the object of this memoir to bring forward
detailed facts in support of this division of the Ferns. As regards the arrangement
of the description I shall, as far as is consistent with the clear statement of facts,
follow the order of the ‘Synopsis Filicum,’ and it will be seen that in many respects
the arrangement of that work coincides with the natural grouping which will be
arrived at towards the close. The chief departure from Hooxer’s arrangement will
be to bring the Schizeeacese and Osmundace into relation with the Gleicheniacez ;
this is done with the object of grouping together at once those Leptosporangiate
Ferns which, together with the Marattiaceze, constitute our first category of Simplices. Matonia will also be associated with these.
