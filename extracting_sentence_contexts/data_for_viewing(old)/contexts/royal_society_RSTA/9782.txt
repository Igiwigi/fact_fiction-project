As seen from the diagram, fig. 7, and from the Tables V. and VLI., the melting-point
of the stable modification is raised one degree by a pressure of 51°28 kg./em.*, and the
melting-point of the unstable modification one degree by a pressure of 53°48 kg./em.’.
The melting-point curves will thus run further apart as the pressure is increased, and
the, at ordinary pressure, unstable modification will at all pressures melt at a lower
temperature than the modification melting at 64° C. and remain unstable.

7. Discussion of Results.

The fact that the melting-point curves of «8-bibrompropionic acid do not intersect
at high pressures, taken together with the somewhat similar relation between the
melting-point curve and the transition-point curve of carbon tetrabromide, as given
in the diagram, fig. 6, are of interest with regard to the theoretical explanations
given as the cause of the occurrence of two different classes of polymorphic substances,
the “ enantiotropic” and the “ monotropic.” These terms were first used by LEHMANN,
who called those polymorphic substances which pass reversibly into each other at a
given transition-point “ enantiotropic,” and those which have one stable and one or
several unstable modifications “ monotropic.” Later an explanation for this different
behaviour of the two classes was given almost simultaneously by Ostwanp* and by
