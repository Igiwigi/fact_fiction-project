Inthe former case,a true
Jasper is formed, which has a quartzose base, instead of having,
as in the latter case, a base of calcedony. The appearance of
these two kinds of jasper is 80 different, that the most inex-
perienced eye cannot fail to distinguigh them at first sight. Many other facts might be added, in support of what I have
said. Calcedony, for example, is easily decomposed : there are
| few masses of this substance of any considerable size, few frag-
ments of flint, jasper, &c. which have lain for any length of
time upon the surface of the earth, that do not atford a demon-
stration of it. Most kinds of cacholong are nothing more than
the eff-ct of this decomposition, in a more or less advanced
state, which (as happens in the girasol, but in a less perfect and '
less striking manner) causes the stones in which it takes place,
to possess the property of becoming transparent in water.
