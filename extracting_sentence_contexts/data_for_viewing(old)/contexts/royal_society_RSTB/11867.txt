were used to normalize the beta images resulting from the indi-
vidual subjects’ analyses (i.e. in subjects’ individual space) for
use in a random-effect second-level analysis.

Potential artefacts from blood pulse and respiration were
controlled using the Translational Algorithms for Psychiatry-
Advancing Science (TAPAS) toolbox standard procedure
(https: // www.tnu.ethz.ch/de/software/tapas/documentations/
physio-toolbox.html; [27]). Realignment parameters (translation
and rotation), as well as their derivatives and the square product
of both parameters and their derivatives, were used as covariates
to control for movement-related artefacts. We also used the arte-
fact detection tools (ART) to control for any movement-related
artefacts (www.nitre.org/projects/artifact_detect/) using the
standard threshold of 2 mm.

The fMRI time series were analysed using the general linear
model approach implemented in SPM. Single-subject models
consisted of one regressor representing the 1 min discussion for
