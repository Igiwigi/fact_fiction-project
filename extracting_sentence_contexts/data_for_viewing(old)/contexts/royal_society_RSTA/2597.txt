traditional proofs any more correct. For instance, Euclid’s proof of the fact that the diagonals of
a parallelogram bisect each other (the one reproduced in Wikipedia) already uses much more
difficult facts that they intersect inside the parallelogram or, for that matter, that they do intersect
at all! As was gradually discovered between the third century B.C and the nineteenth century
A.D., the reason is that Euclid’s text missed a whole bunch of axioms (or, in fact, at least two such
bunches, betweenness and continuity), necessary to derive his claims.

2Concerning this paragraph, the second anonymous referee commented that ‘Physics is driven by observation and
measurement, and can therefore live well with incorrect proofs’. For me, Mathematics is also largely driven by observation
and experiment. In Physics, you can afford speculations, mathematical guesswork usually stays very concrete and specific.
Before becoming mathematical theorems such things as the asymptotic law of distribution of primes, or Dirichlet’s theorem
on primes in arithmetic progressions, and thousands of other similar results were experimental facts. It is exactly the possibility
of instantly switching the register, and checking weird speculation against irrevocable facts of life, that makes Mathematics
so unique.


I am not trying to question the uppermost historical significance of Euclid’s book, which
questioned the standards of proofs accepted before that time, and which set new standards for
many centuries to come. Quite amazingly, many proofs in the later books, including Euclid’s
proof of the infinitude of primes, are proofs even for us.

e Actually, even at the university level people rarely seriously contemplate the proofs they
are telling to their students in the elementary courses. Thus, until very recently most of
the proofs in undergraduate Analysis courses suffered from systematic delusions related
to the incorrect use of infinity, that survived from the early twentieth century.
