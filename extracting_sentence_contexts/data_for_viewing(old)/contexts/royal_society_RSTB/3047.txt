confined to the region of the carapace, as though the agent producing it arose there.
A similar partial nocturning is sometimes met with in the middle third only of the
body of Hippolyte varians.

With respect to the nature of the blue substance of nocturnes, the question
naturally arises, “ Is it Heemocyanin”? To answer this question it would be necessary
to discuss the prevalent views as to the nature and functions of Hxemocyanin. We
propose to leave this discussion for the present and to content ourselves here with
recording several facts. In the first place the blue colour of nocturnes (Macromysis)
is not discharged by carbon dioxide, so that, if the discharge of colour by this gas is a
decisive test for Heemocyanin, we must conclude that the blue substance of Macromysis
is a different body. In the second place, the blood of M. nigra, which is constantly
alkaline, exhibits variations of colour. It is colourless in some, and blue in other
animals. This blueness we may add in conclusion counts (except in certain green
colour-forms) for nothing in diurnal coloration, for then it is masked by the closely
woven cloak of diurnal colour.

Though the facts which we have set forth in this section do not warrant a complete
or confident hypothesis, we claim that they show :—

1. That the blue substance, to which the characteristic nocturnal colour of Hippolyte
