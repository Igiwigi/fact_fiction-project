so that orthogonality of B and E is key to helicity conservation. This is precisely the type of
question whose general study was pioneered in the work of Tartar and Murat. Indeed, we recall
the following version of the div-curl lemma [6,13]: suppose we have a sequence of magnetic
and electric fields (Bx, Ex) —~ (B,E) converging weakly in LP x LP’ and such that {V - By} and
{0,B, + V x Ex} are uniformly bounded in L? x LP’. Then Bx - Ex ~B-E inthe space of measures.
Observe that, since E; = By x ux, the energy bound in (3.9) is not enough to put us in this setting.
On the other hand, for instance if we assume uniform bounds on (u,), (Bx) in L3, then (Ex) is
bounded in L*/? and the div-curl lemma applies. A closely related result in [52] is that in fact for
any weak solution of (3.8) with u,B €L> magnetic helicity is a conserved quantity. In terms of
the general framework sketched in §2 this implies that in the L3 (and in particular the bounded)
setting the relaxed constitutive set K’ has empty interior, because necessarily B - E = 0. Conversely,
adding this condition to (3.12) leads to a relaxation of ideal MHD which is consistent with the
Woltjer—-Taylor theory, and in particular to the following result in [51]:

Theorem 3.4. There exist weak solutions u,B € L° of the ideal MHD system (3.8) for which € and W
are not conserved in time, but magnetic helicity H remains constant.

Finally, to close this section we recall that, beside conditions for the conservation of magnetic
helicity, also the conservation of energy and cross-helicity have been studied in [49,52-54].
Conservation of the magnetic helicity was shown in [49] for solutions u,B which are Hélder
