be true to say that the anterior end of the endoderm causes a growing primitive streak
to bend towards it. An alternative view would be that the anterior part of the
endoderm attracts the anterior end of the primitive streak, whilst the posterior part is
indifferent to it, and that, as suggested above, mechanical factors are involved. The
first hypothesis, however, that both ends of the primitive streak are attracted by the
anterior part of the endoderm seems to fit the facts best. The question should be
investigated by a series of experiments in which arrangements such as that in specimen
540 are employed, where the main attraction of the endoderm is concentrated on the
posterior part of the primitive streak instead of the anterior part.

In several specimens which show a marked bend (e.g., 565, 543, 537), the most anterior
end of the neural tube bends backward again, away from the anterior part of the endo-
derm, towards which the embryonic axis as a whole has been directed. This slight
bending of the head seems to be an expression of a regulative tendency towards the
straightening out of the bent axis. Thus, on several occasions it has been observed that
although this anterior secondary flexion may be quite pronounced at first, it is then
always confined to the very furthest anterior end of the neural tube, while later it tends
to progress backwards and to become less noticeable. This process causes the whole
