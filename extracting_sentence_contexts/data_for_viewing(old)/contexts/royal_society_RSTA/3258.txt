Figure 1. Potential energy curves calculated for C+ interacting with RG. The key in (a) applies to all plots. The interaction
energies have been calculated at the RCCSD(T)/aVooZ level of theory and both non-SO and SO curves are shown as dashed and
solid lines, respectively —see text for details. The zoom-ins in (b)—(d) have the same vertical energy scale as that in the C+-Ne
plot (a), allowing visual comparison of the evolution of the SO splitting of the 2/7 ¢ states as the atomic number of the RG atom
increases. (Online version in colour.)

these plots, it can be seen that the X2/7 states are always much more strongly bound than
are the A?+ ones. This is in line with the fact that the latter have the unpaired carbon 2p
electron positioned along the internuclear axis, where there will be higher electron repulsion
with electrons from the RG atom. For the 7/7 state, the unpaired electron is positioned
perpendicular to the internuclear axis, reducing electron repulsion, and so allowing the RG atom
to interact more effectively with the positive charge on the carbon nucleus. The spectroscopic
constants obtained from the non-SO interaction potentials are presented in table 1, and these
are commented on below. Additionally, we provide the calculated vibrational energy levels as
electronic supplementary material.

To check whether multi-reference character may be affecting the spectroscopic parameters, we
also calculated MRCI curves (although not over such a wide range as the RCCSD(T) ones) and
from these derived the spectroscopic parameters. We then compared these with the non-SO non-
CP-corrected RCCSD(T)/QZ results, with the sets of data presented together in table 2 for easy
