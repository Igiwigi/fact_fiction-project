radius compared with the ranges of the rays concerned. In this case the several
rays move along the radii of a sphere having the nucleus at its centre. They
therefore diverge like rays of light from a luminous point, and the intensities, or
more accurately the closeness of approximation, of the effects, upon successive
spherical surfaces, must diminish outwards with the inverse square of the distance.
But this inverse square law is departed from in the particular that the effect of
any one ray is not in itself a uniform one along its path. The observations of
Brace and others have shown that, just before the electrified particle loses its
kinetic energy, there is a rapid increase in its power of ionisation. A limit to this
increase is attained some little time before the power of ionisation ceases. The
curve depicting these facts is well known. Its definition, as determined by
GeicEr,* is used in the applications of it which I make in what follows.

We seem, then, entitled to expect that a halo would show features in general
accordance with the following scheme of development. We first assume that the
medium possesses the stopping power and other properties of air. Along a horizontal
axis we then repeat the Geiger curve for each constituent Â«-ray concerned in
generating the halo, placing the outer termina-
