If the break is made between two negative or between two
positive elements, the number of yariations obyiously becomes increased by one unit; but
if between a positive and a negative element, that number becomes decreased by one
unit. The number of these latter intervals is 2y, and of the former yp +»—2y. Hence the probability of the index becoming 2y+1 is HD, and of its becoming

When g=0 the aboye expression fails; but reverting to the equation from which it is
derived, we obtain

(24) If we wish to find the chance of the specific superior limit becoming equal to the
absolute superior limit, we must write 9 in the above formule equal to y, that one of the
two quantities , » which is not greater than the other, and we shall obtain

80 that, in fact, [p, », »+Z]=[p, »+L, »+1], which relation may also be obtained by
@ priori considerations.

(25) With reference to the remark made concerning the mode of obtaining the value
of [p, », 9], I proceed to show how it may be obtained directly by the integration of an
equation in differences, and by a method analogous in idea to that by which [p, », +F]
was made to depend on [j, », 9]. For as in that case we conceived an open pencil to
be closed and then reopened, 80 we may imagine one of the rays to be withdrawn and
then reinserted. In this way, observing that the effect of introducing a negative sign
into a circle of p positive and 7 negative signs consisting of y distinct groups of each is
to produce no change in the number of the groups if inserted between two negative
8igns, but to increase that number by unity if inserted between two positive 8igns, We
may infer that the probability of » becoming »+1, in consequence of such insertion, is

þ—v Te » N+v
Fong, and of y remaining unaltered, is "v7

Hence we obtain the equation in differences,

in which w may. be considered constant, and y and g to vary.
