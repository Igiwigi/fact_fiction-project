CoNCLUSION.

The importance of these observations lies in the fact that, by examining and com-
paring the shells, an opportunity is given of observing the origin of a set of structural
variations in correlation to, and perhaps in consequence of, environmental changes
which are to some extent ascertained, The first point which is to be noticed is that
the shells of each sample, whether it be from a separate lake or only from a particular
terrace, are more like to each other than to the shells of one of the other lakes, or to
those of another terrace in the same lake as at Shumish Kul, where the shells of each
terrace have a distinct appearance and character of their own, and may easily be
known from the shells of higher or lower terraces.

The next feature of importance is the fact that, in the four independent cases—
Shumish Kul, Jaksi Klich, Jaman Klich, and the Egyptian lagoon Abu Kir*—the
shells which have lived under similar conditions, 7.¢., in very salt water, have become
like each other, having the characters of thinness, high colour, small beaks, ribbing on
the inside, and great relative length. In view of these four instances of similar
variations occurring under. similar conditions, it seems almost certain that these
conditions are in some way the cause of the variations. Similarly, in the case of the
two groups of Cockles from Mareotis which have been isolated and exposed to fresh
water in separate lakes, the result has been to produce a form of shell in both cases
which is practically the same. Cases of this kind, in which it is possible to observe
the appearance and progress of a variation through successive generations in the same
place, are so rare that it has seemed worth while to describe these shells in detail.
The mode of occurrence of the shells in terraces at Shumish Kul provides an almost
