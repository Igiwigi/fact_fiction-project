Should, for instance, the point of the cusp « Þ y, fig. 2, be
immersed in a shadow from « to Þ, this point, in such a case,
though it may be somewhat blunted from & to y, will never-
theless appear sharp, because its whole breadth does often not
exceed + of a second, whence its true form must needs escape
our observation. We do not, in this instance, see the very
faintly illuminated point « Þ, nor yet the real luminous edge
y EB, but only its prominent and brighter part « y; a deception
this, which cannot take place in the other parts of the termi-
nator, where indeed the same causes, viz. the shadows of

mountains, will, no doubt, at times occasion an uneven, ragged
appearance, but cannot materially affect the very faint light
of the whole. It is, moreover, evident, that even when the extremities of
the cusps are, as in fig. 1, not darkened by shadows, the faint
luminous points fg, þ 7, are not always visible, but can only

* The perpendicular height of these mountains, as I have already shewn in a former
work, is in proportion to the diameter of the planet, at least as great as the height of
the mountains in the moon, in proportion to its much $horter diameter ; this fact I
have had frequent opportunities to ascertain, See Selenotop. Fragm. $. 522.

be seen with certainty at "auch times when the air is very clear
and calm, and a good telescope with a large aperture, and high
magnifying power, is used in the observation. And it follows
that, except under those circumstances, the parts of the cusps
af, c þ, must, on account of their great sharpness, be the ap-
parent and sufficiently luminous extremities ; since, according
to well known principles, the exterior points a, and c will
have as much light as the point &, near the middle of the
crescent.
