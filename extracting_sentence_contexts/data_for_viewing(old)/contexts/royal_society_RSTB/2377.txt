It is probable that in the body lecithin is not present in the free state, but in
combination with a cerebrin or cerebrins to form a still more complex substance
called protagon.

The Marchi reaction consists in placing small pieces of nervous tissue in a mixture of
osmic acid and Mtuter’s fluid, after previous hardening in Mitier’s fluid. Under these
circumstances healthy nerve fibres are not stained, but degenerated nerve fibres are
stained an intense black. In the later stages of degeneration, when the fatty products
of the decomposition of the fibres have been absorbed, this black staining is naturally
no longer observable. It is important also to observe that ordinary neutral fats, such
as are contained in adipose tissue, give the Marchi reaction. It was knowledge of
this fact that led us in part to the present investigation, and our expectation has
been fully confirmed that the cause of the Marchi reaction in degenerated nerve fibres
is the replacement. of the phosphorised fat by non-phosphorised fat.

Before the commencement of our joint work, one of us (F'. W. M.)* had made some
preliminary experiments in this direction, which were continued in conjunction with
Dr. Barrart.+ Spinal cords on one side of which degeneration had occurred, due to
