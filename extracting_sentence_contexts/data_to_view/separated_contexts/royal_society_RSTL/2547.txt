As to the fine sand in which the house was enyeloped, it may be compared

vessels which have sunk and presented an obstacle to a marine current charged with
sediment. I ought to state that I was unable to examine the remains of the house, since it was
entirely cut away, having stood, as will be seen by the section (fig. 5.), in the exact
line of the canal, the surface of the waters of which, like the foundation of the house,
were sitnated at about the mean level of the sea; for Lake Maeler and the Baltic are

height, the same lock at Sidertehe which usually serves to convey vessels from the
Baltic up into Lake Maeler, is used to convey them up in a contrary direction from
the lake into the sea. But although I could not see the relic of the fishing-but itself,
I may observe that I had the advantage of conversing with the two eminent engi-
