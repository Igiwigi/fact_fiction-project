4. Conclusion and discussion

A general approach to apply the equivalence principle for optical metasurfaces has been
discussed here, allowing one to locally manipulate the scattering distribution at will. We have
applied this concept to a few relevant examples at optical frequencies. We have shown that a
single electrical metasurface, with deeply subwavelength thickness, can be used to fully control
the scattering signature of optical elements such as thin-film solar cells and polarization beam
splitters, and drastically boost their performance, while minimizing the size of the device and
improving the robustness to losses. Moreover, we have designed graded metasurfaces to perform
more complex functionalities, such as cloaking, by reconstructing the desired field distribution
in the near-field. Owing to their conformal profile and the fact that our designs are all based
on the alternation of commonly available optical materials, the proposed optical films may
be directly integrated into nanophotonic devices. Our technique may also be scaled up to
longer wavelengths to realize ultrathin infrared, terahertz or microwave elements, including
broadband couplers, selective filters and real-time conformal cloaks. The described control and


manipulation of optical scattering through metasurfaces, along with their compatibility with
standard lithographic techniques and on-chip fabrication technologies, pave the way to several
applications in optics, and open up a new route to design compact, planarized optical devices.
