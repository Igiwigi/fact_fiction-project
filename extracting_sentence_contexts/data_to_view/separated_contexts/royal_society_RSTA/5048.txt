In the paper above referred to, further particulars are given regarding the
standardisation of these thermometers. During the experiments there described

they were used to determine the rate of rise in the temperature of the calorimeter,
whereas, in the work I am now describing,

they were used chiefly as detectors of any

therefore omit the details of the determination of their fixed points, &c., although I
