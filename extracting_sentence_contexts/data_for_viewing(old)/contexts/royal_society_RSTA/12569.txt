about a definite change in {he viscosity magnitndes, It is therefore made evident
that viseostty or intermolecnlay attraction is in reality a property of the atoms of
which the molecvles are composed:

But besides ehange in molecalar weight, change in the mode of grouping of the
same atoms rlsn affects the valnes of the viscosity magnitudes, The obseryations
‘slow that iso compounds haye values differing from thow of isomeric normal
compounds ; ring compounds have not the yalues which by the study of straight chain
compounds they might be expected to have; compounds containing hydroxy! oxygen
give values ditiering from those containing carhonyl oxygen, he same utoms must
ierefore exert different effeots when differently linked together. That the otfects of
the atoms m one portion of the molecule need not he affected by change in the inode
of linkage of the atoms in another portion is proved by the fact that the effects of
CH,, of iodine, of bromine, ete., are the same in normal ond in iso compounds, In
g the present stale of the question it is impossible, however, to ascertain to what extent
& the individual effects of ench atom are inilnenced by an allerstion in the mode of
2 grouping in « given portion of'7 molecule, Hence jhe method adopted i deducing

fimdamental constants is to-assume that certain atoms retain the same values under
‘9 all conditions whilst the collective change in the values of those atoms which are
affected by the mode of linkage is, when possible, expressed either as a new constant
—the value of an iso linkago, a double linkage, ete.—or by saying that a particulor
atom has assnmed a new value, e.., carbonyl oxygen, hydroxyl oxygen, ete. In some
cases the method of calonlation may lead to the result that a negative constant is
ascribed toa partiolar atom. In deducing the yolues of carbon and hydrogen, for
