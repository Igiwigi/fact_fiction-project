But
later the case of Zn, which at first had seemed to stand in the way of an explanation
on these lines, gave cause for encouragement. The series for Zn are well defined, the
measures good, and the formule reproduce the lines with great accuracy.* Great
confidence can thus be put in the values for A, and A,, and it was noticed that they
were both extremely exact multiples of the difference A,—2A,. In fact, the values
are A, = 31x 543°446w? and A, = 15x 543°476w*. This relation could hardly be due
ato mere chance, especially when it was also noticed that 543°44 is very close to 3/2 the
former 360, and, further, the 450 of Mg is about 5/4 the same. In other words, with
Bike rough values used 860 = 4x90, 450 = 5x90, and 540 =6x90.
