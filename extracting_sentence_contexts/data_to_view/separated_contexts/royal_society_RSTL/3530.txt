By this means, spectra were obtained whose lengths
were in a highly increased proportion to their breadths. In one experiment this pro-
portion (as ascertained by measurement of the impression left) was s0 high as 67 : 1. But in this, as in other experiments where a less degree of dilatation was obtained,

the possible influence of streaks left by the brush in its preparation. The only cer-

tain conclusion then that can be drawn from these trials is, the nonexistence of any
large inactive spaces in the spectrum.
