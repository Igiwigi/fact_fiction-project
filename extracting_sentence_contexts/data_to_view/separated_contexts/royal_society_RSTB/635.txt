Gap* relates an exactly similar experience in connection with the posterior
extremity of the Frog. He found that by drawing on the ilio-psoas muscle, he
produced not only flexion of the thigh on the abdomen, but also of the leg on the
thigh, and dorsiflexion of the foot on the leg, in fact the extremity was placed
exactly in the position of a frog about to jump. The cause of this was found to be
the fact that the insufficient length of the ham-strings did not allow complete
flexion at the hip without pulling on the leg, and thus producing flexion at the
knee. Then as the tibialis anticus has its origin above the knee joint, dorsiflexion
at the ankle followed as a necessary consequence, the tibialis anticus in its turn not
being long enough to allow of such extreme flexion at the knee, without drawing on
the foot. The importance of these observations becomes apparent when we consider
the numerous fallacies which would result if these facts were not borne in mind when
we observed the various movements produced by stimulation of any single nerve root.
