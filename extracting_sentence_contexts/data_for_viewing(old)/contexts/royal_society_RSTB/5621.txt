(5) A. Sydowi, Catalogue No. Ac. 29. Isolated at Ardeer and identified by
Miss CHURCH.

(6) A. cyaneus Batter, Catalogue No. Ac. 97. Purchased from Baarn and in our
opinion a strain of A. Sydowt.

The carbon balance sheets for these six species are given in Table VIT.

All these balance sheets are of the same type as those of the A. versicolor strains and
justify the placing of A. Sydowi in the same general group. All the cultures grow well
on this medium and none of them gives rise to appreciable amounts of any end-
product other than CO,. They also resemble the A. versicolor species in the fact
that none of them produces any appreciable amount of titratable acid, and that
most of them actually give rise to a decrease in the titratable acidity.
