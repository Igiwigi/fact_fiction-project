In 4 days, drillers re-cored the icy ‘cork’ and obtained about 12 m of the new fast frozen
lake water core before the water came up again into the borehole and finally froze at the level
of 65-67 m above the ice-water interface. The bottommost 10cm (of 12m core) frozen water ice
segment was provided for microbiological studies. However, despite the fact that the Russians were the first to enter a subglacial Antarctic lake at
such a great depth (3769 m) and were able to perform the lake entry twice, the drilling technology
used (electromechanical drill along with kerosene drilling fluid with the use of foranes (namely
Freon 141B, 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane, as densifier)) proved to be inappropriate to collect
liquid water in general and clean samples in particular. More technological developments are
needed to face such a challenge, including the development of sophisticated systems consisting
of well-sealed transport modules preventing the contamination of in-module-encapsulated
devices/samplers with the drilling fluid [11] as well as the use of thermal drilling just before
the next lake entry, which is now under discussion.

3. First results from borehole-frozen water of Lake Vostok upon first lake entry

The main objective of this study was to search for resident microbial life in the subglacial Lake
Vostok by studying the uppermost layer of the water that entered the borehole upon the first lake
entry (5 February 2012) and then was frozen, in comparison with thoroughly studied accretion
ice [23,24].
