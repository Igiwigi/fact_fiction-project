Figure 4. Dysregulation of Ca’* and redox signalling in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The calcium hypothesis of AD suggests that the formation of AB oligomers brings
about an overall increase in Ca”* signalling that results in a permanent elevation in the resting level of Ca°* to 300 nM that then erases memories soon after they
are formed by activating calcineurin (CaN) inducing long-term depression (LTD). An elevation of Ca’* sets up a positive feedback loop by acting to stimulate the
hydrolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate the AG oligomers that bind to the cellular prion protein (PrP‘) that then activates the InsP3/Ca°+
signalling pathway. Vitamin D reduces the risk of AD by acting to maintain Ca’* and redox signalling at their normal low resting levels.
