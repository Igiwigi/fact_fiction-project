oscillations are generally consistent with predictions based on models of Jupiter’s interior, a fact
that argues against their detection being a false positive. On the other hand, the relatively low
signal-to-noise ratio involved indicates the importance of conducting follow-up observations to
provide confirmation.

The putative detection of Jupiter’s oscillations has fuelled speculation that it may be possible
to detect similar oscillations of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, through similar means, from
ground-based or space-based platforms. An attempt to detect Neptune’s oscillations was made
by obtaining 49 days of nearly continuous broadband photometry during the K2 mission [6]. No
evidence for global oscillations was found, and an upper limit of approximately 5 ppm was placed
on the contribution such oscillations make to the brightness variations occurring at an oscillation
frequency of v~1mHz. This upper limit on the brightness variation translates roughly to an
upper limit of 40 cm s~! on the radial velocity amplitude [6].
