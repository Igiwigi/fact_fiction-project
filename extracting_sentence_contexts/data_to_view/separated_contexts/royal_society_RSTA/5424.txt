Turing assumed initial homogeneity out of analytical necessity,
recognizing the rarity of this condition within the developing organism (‘Most of an organism,
most of the time, is developing from one pattern into another, rather than from homogeneity into a pattern’,
Turing 1952). In many specific developmental situations the inducing noise or asymmetry may
not be random but instead influenced by field inhomogenities, such as a pre-existing anatomical
feature. Thus symmetry breaking as a property of a network or system should be viewed as a
potential rather than an event, as many systems capable of breaking symmetry and producing
pattern de novo will in fact be guided by pre-existing anatomical landmarks which bias the system
to pattern in a nonrandom manner. That is, while a symmetry breaking system can be defined
by its ability to break symmetry de novo, in an embryonic context it is seldom likely that a truly
symmetric or homogeneous field is the starting point for pattern formation. Considering these cell behaviours and attributes, the structure of composite epithelial—
mesenchymal organs lends itself to the operation of different types of pattern-forming systems.
