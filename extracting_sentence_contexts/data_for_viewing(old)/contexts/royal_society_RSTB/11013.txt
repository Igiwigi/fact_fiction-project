cell-level developmental processes, possibly influenced by
plastic responses to local environmental cues. In principle,
the colony-level process of inversion could be described as
a function of cell-level traits, with arguments possibly includ-
ing the degree of cell elongation, the number of cytoplasmic
connections formed by each cell, and the shapes of reaction
norms describing cellular responses to mechanical or chemi-
cal signals. The likely complexity of such a function does not

Genetic variation in n,


change the fact that the colony-level process of inversion is
entirely controlled by cell-level traits.

The analogous functions underlying many colony-level
traits will be even more complex, perhaps even inscrutable.
They may include signalling, positional information,
feedbacks and more complicated cell-cell interactions.
However, their obscurity and complexity do not imply their
non-existence. Traits of multicellular organisms must
emerge from the traits of their cells; there is no other source.
