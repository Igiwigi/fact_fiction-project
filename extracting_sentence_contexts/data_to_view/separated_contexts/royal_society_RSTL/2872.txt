In the Musca the amount of temperaturein the larya state seldom
exceeds 15, and in the perfect perhaps not more than 2*5, aboye that of the sur-
rounding medium. It is probable that this estimate of the difference between the
larva and perfect state of dipterous insects may be rather too little, owing to the
difficulty of making observations on these insects individually, their small size ren-
dering precision in the experiment almost impossible. But the fact is sufficiently
clear that they have not 80 high a temperature as hymenopterous insects. The same
difficulty does not exist in making observations on Jarge insects, particularly on the
large soft-bodied larvze of the Sphinges, and accordingly it is found that in these lepi-
dopterous insects we are better enabled to ascertain the maximum amount of heat
evolyed by the larva, and the difference which exists between its powers of generating
heat and that of its perfect insect. This difference is greater in lepidopterous insects
than in dipterons, and approaches nearer to the hymenopterous.
