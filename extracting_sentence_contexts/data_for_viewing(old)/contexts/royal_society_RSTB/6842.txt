brown or reddish brown hornblende by heating hornblende of a different colour,
usually green (K6zu, Yoshiki and Kani 1927; Barnes 1930; Kennedy and Dixon
1936). A notable optical change in the heated hornblende is the reduction of the
extinction angle (Zac), often to 0°. According to the results of Barnes (as restated
by Winchell in 1932) the changes are due to the oxidation of ferrous iron, owing to
loss of hydrogen (not water), without any addition of oxygen from the air. t will be
well to refer to this process as ‘‘auto-oxidation”, for Barnes’s conclusions, as stated
by himself, appear to the writer to be expressed in somewhat ambiguous terms.
Barnes carried out the heating, in air, to 800° C. He restored heated hornblende to
its original colour and optical condition by reheating it in hydrogen. Kennedy and
Dixon found that similar changes in an amphibole heated in air to 1000° C. were
produced by the driving off of water (at several stages), but did not comment on the
fact that their conclusions clashed with the views of Barnes and Winchell. Neither
did they discuss the ratio of the percentages of ferric to ferrous iron in their analyses;
in the unheated amphibole it is 0-54: 7-99, while in the brown hornblende produced
by heating it is 9-70: 0-17. There has clearly been either oxidation or auto-oxidation.
During the heating no precautions were apparently taken to prevent oxidation of
amphibole or possible released hydrogen by the air. Kézu, however, by heating
common hornblende in nitrogen at a pressure of one atmosphere, produced reddish

brown hornblende in which the extinction angle was reduced to zero.

In Montserrat it is clear that the red-brown type of hornblende results from some
change affecting either green or brown hornblende. The fact that the red-brown
amphibole occurs only in rocks that show clear signs of oxidation from external
