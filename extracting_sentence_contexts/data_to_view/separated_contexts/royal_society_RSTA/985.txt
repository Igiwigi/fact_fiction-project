These elastomers are heterogeneous composites of a polymeric matrix
with embedded magnetic particles. There are a couple of designations used in the scientific
literature for these composites, such as magnetorheological (MR) elastomers, ferroelastomers,
magnetic polymers, magnetic gels, ferrogels, etc. [1-5]. Conspicuous is the fact that there is no
unity in the usage of these definitions despite the quite different material compositions and
consequently different physical performances. Therefore, it is reasonable to distinguish at least
between composites filled with nanoparticles and those filled with microparticles, as well as
between composites with soft gel-like matrices and composites with significantly stiffer resin-like
matrices. In this context, ferrogel is a suitable designation for a material based on the nanosized
particles embedded into a gel-like matrix, while by the term MAE a composite based on an
elastomer with magnetic microparticles is to be understood, as is the case with ferrofluids and
magnetorheological suspensions [6,7].
