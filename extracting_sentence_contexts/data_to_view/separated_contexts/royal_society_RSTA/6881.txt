The
finite-difference form of the biharmonic equation, however, involves more pivotal points,
and in particular its satisfaction at internal points adjacent to the boundary would involve
the elimination of many fictitious points, at least one of which is more than one mesh length
distant from the boundary. Ficure 14

Fox & Southwell (1941) therefore proposed to satisfy the differential equation only at
those internal points, marked with a cross in figure 14, which involve only those fictitious
points, marked with an open circle, less than one mesh length outside the boundary. The
other internal points, marked with a closed circle, would be obtained by means of the
boundary conditions; they might then by analogy be called internal fictitious points. The finite-difference equation at the point Pin figure 14, for example, involves the internal
fictitious points 7, Q and V, the external fictitious points S and R, and the known boundary
value B. Points 7’ and S are obtained from formulae of interpolation, for both function and
derivative, where the line ‘7... cuts the boundary; S and Q are obtained similarly from the
line SQ... and V (and U) from the line UV....
