sap-wood and heart are most pronounced.

The mycelia in the heart-wood cultures were almost entirely confined to thin,
cobweb-like, superficial growths, which scarcely obscured the view of the wood
beneath, even in the most luxuriant specimens, and in many cases were so incon-
spicuous that the wood appeared unaltered, and no mycelium could be seen at all
until close examination in an oblique light betrayed it. In these cases I am speaking
of the naked eye characters.

On the sap-wood, on the contrary, the mycelium had formed a dense white felted
covering, like cotton-wool, and even in the feeblest specimens the wood was entirely

* T nse this term for the sake of brevity, in spite of the fact that lignin and lignification can no
longer be regarded as the simple matters they were once supposed to be. Bourguexor (see ‘ Zeitschr. f.
Pflanzenkrankh,’ 1895, p. 39, for reference) finds emulsin-like enzymes in these wood fangi, which split
glucosides like wsculin, coniferin, &e., into sugars and other bodies.

covered. Evidently, therefore, the fungus grows more luxuriantly in sap-wood than
in heart-wood—at any rate, of the species of tree examined.

The same truth comes out on examining the specimens with regard to the presence
or absence of young hymenia, the waxy yellow humps showing up distinctly on
