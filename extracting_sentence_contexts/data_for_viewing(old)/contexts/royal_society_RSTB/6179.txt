These tables have been given, not to serve as any basis of further generalization,
but simply to exhibit the kind of perversely erratic result that one encounters in
seeking to accumulate practical data on the question. Not only may the average
reactivity of a given frog vary from day to day, but, as we have seen, it may vary
as the result of temperature change—and then not as any simple function of tempera-
ture—within a brief period of time. On the whole, too, it would appear that the
labyrinths of some frogs are inherently more lethargic under gravity test than those
of others.

One clear conclusion is that the utricular otoliths are not set, as one might, for
example, set a piece of mechanical apparatus, to respond at particular fixed angles
of inclination. This fact may be illustrated in another way. We sometimes used
the following method of measurement. The frog is tilted first, say, to its right, until
a response occurs ; then in the leftward direction, until a reaction of an opposite
kind is registered. One may thus obtain successive measurements of the total angle
between responses. These, too, show considerable quantitative variation. What is
more, a frog that has first reacted on rightward tilt may sometimes react in the
opposite sense, before, by undoing of the first direction of tilt, the table has been
brought level again. Because of these and other analogous findings, we have on
many occasions been led to infer that the momentary responsiveness to a particular
direction of lateral tilting depends, in part, upon the immediately preceding
