control parameters without selecting control protocols nor even recognizing which protocols
were used. Such a platform might be an artificial intelligence which selects and combines proper
control protocols and provides desired parameters, with an input of a little information such as
Hamiltonian, experimentally feasible parameter range or even a measured dataset. In this sense,
the ultimate goal of the study of controls is to be forgotten by people, although it will take more
time. We hope that this review paper on FFST will remind readers of what is now in our toolbox,
help in the development of the platform, and entertain those interested in non-trivial scaling
properties in the dynamics of physical systems.

2. Basic concept

An important procedure in FFST is to look for a viable state of the system during the speed
control, taking into account physical constraints. This resembles the fact that our running form
changes with speed. As you may notice, our body is not simply moving faster when we run
faster (figure 1b). It is because that we are in the air for a certain period of time after kicking off
the ground, and fall at a constant acceleration due to the gravity no matter what speed we are
moving horizontally. Thus, simply accelerated motion cannot be realized due to the fixed gravity.
In this section, we illustrate the basic concept of FFST showing how to find the proper state of a
quantum system in the speed control [2].

(a) Speed control of quantum dynamics of a single particle

As an example, we consider speed control of a quantum dynamics of a single particle in potential
Vo(t,t). A reference dynamics, of which speed is controlled, is defined by the wave function
Wo(r, t) of the particle, and Y(r,0) and Y(r, T) are referred to as the initial and target (final) state,
