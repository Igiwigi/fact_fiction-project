C. Gopwixn-AvsTExt &o far back as 1849 came to the conclusion, on evidence
of an entirely different order, that the bed of the English Channel © was in the condition
of dry land previous to its occupation by the waters of the pleistocene sea, or during
the period of the pliocene (crag) accumulations of the German basin, and that, together
with a large area beyond, it served to connect the British Islands with France on the
south, and Ireland on the west, into a tract which had a far greater amount of eleya-
tion than any portion of ib has ab present ” (p. 94); and further, he. remarks that
© the period of the terrestrial conditions of greatest cold over the area of Great
Britain would therefore be, when it was part of an area, of much greater extent, and
at a much greater elevation ” (p. 95). He shows that there is nob only evidence of a marginal line of coast at depths
of from 50 to 60 fathoms, but there is also on the western slope of the Little Sole
Bank, where the sea bed falls rapidly from the 100 to the 200 fathom lines, evidence
of a «till greater former elevation, in the fact that on these slopes large perfect, thongh
decayed, shells of littoral species, such as Littorina littorea, Patella vulgata, &c., and
$hell-8and are found, whence he infers © that we have at this place the indication of a
coast-line of no very distant geological period, buried under a great depth of water,
and removed to a great distance from the nearest present coast-line.”

On the west coast of Scotland the excessive glaciation of all the sea lochs and
islands point to the westward flow of the great ice-sheet, descending from the water-
shed of the Ben Nevis and other mountain ranges of the Highlands, over ground then
above the present sea-level, to a more distant sea ; and both Professor A. Gammazt
