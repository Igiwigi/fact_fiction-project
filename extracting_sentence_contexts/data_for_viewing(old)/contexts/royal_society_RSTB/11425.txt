dent in the case of geometrical diagrams, icons are already
filtered signs that only represent some aspects of their objects,
those aspects related to the structure of the objects them-
selves. This is clearly stated in Peirce’s writing, especially
when he refers to the role of icons in mathematical reasoning.
Diagrams, graphs and mathematical models are, in Peirce
view, icons of the events they represent (CP 3.362). An icon
is, thus, a diagrammatic relation that, according to Peirce,
needs to be ‘as skeletonized as possible’.

We form in the imagination some sort of diagrammatic, that is,

iconic, representation of the facts, as skeletonized as possible.

The impression of the present writer is that with ordinary per-

sons this is always a visual image, or mixed visual and

muscular; but this is an opinion not founded on any systematic
examination. If visual, it will either be geometrical, that is, such
that familiar spatial relations stand for the relations asserted in
the premises, or it will be algebraical, where the relations are
expressed by objects which are imagined to be subject to certain

rules, whether conventional or experiential (CP 2.778).
