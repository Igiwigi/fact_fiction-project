reflex action of the lithocyst, and writhing response of the polypite continuing to assert
themselves beyond the region in which the contractile waves have been blocked by
section,

Exhaustion of a narrow isthmus of junction tisswe sometimes has the effect of
blocking the passage of contractile waves in that isthmus, their passage, however,
being resumed when the junction tissue is allowed time to recover its full excitability.

It has been several times observed that the ganglionic influence of a lithocyst admits
of asxerting itself at a distance from the seab of the lithocyst itself, and this even
when severe forms of section are interposed between the lithocyst and the distant point
in the tissue at which the contractile waves are originating. The interpretation of
this fact need not again be rendered.

It has been uniformly observed that the contractile tissues of Aurelia, after having
been completely severed with a sharp scalpel, in from four to eight hours regenerate
themselves sufficiently to admit of the re-establishment of physiological continuity
across the line of previous severance.

IV. LITERATURE.

I shall terminate this concluding paper on the locomotor system of Medusz with
as brief a reference as possible to the existing literature of the subject. In my first
paper I have already had occasion to render an epitome of the memoirs of Professors
Agass1z and HxCkEL, 80 that it becomes needless in this place again to state the
