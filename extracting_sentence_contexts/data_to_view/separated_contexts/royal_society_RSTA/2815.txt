Tt is of course understood that the digits “11 in the
limit have been chosen so that the 17A,, 6A,, come very close. The argument
depends on the possibility of doing this. In fact Ryppere’s tables give the limit
22926, so that the modification by ‘11 is extremely slight. Thus the observed line is
the line corresponding to m = 5 of this series, and it probably hides the weaker line
of D’(8). This accounts for the deviation noted above between calculated and
observed in D” (8).
