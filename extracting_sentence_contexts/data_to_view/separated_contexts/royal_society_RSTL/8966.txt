Hence an equation
may be expressed, possibly eyen in numerous ways, by means of different sets of prime
factors according to the system of events to which the event under consideration is
referred—these prime factors being indeed the symbols of the © simple weights” among
which the © substitutions ” are conceived of as occurring which are the causes of the
eyents, every such expression necessarily involves an assertion or an hypothesis as to the
composition of 80me one or more among the units of ponderable matter, of which the
transformations are considered, which constitutes the base of the symbolic system,


SIR B. C. BRODIE ON THE CALCULUS OF CHEMICAL OPERATIONS, 89

analogous to the fundamental hypothesis which is the base of the system constructed
in Part T., namely, that the unit of hydrogen is itself a simple weight and expressed
by a single letter «. This is not the place for the further discussion of this question,
which I shall hereafter have occasion to consider in some detail ; but I have made the
preceding remarks to prevent any misapprehension arising in the mind of the reader in
reference to the examples of chemical events given in this and the following Section, in
which the equations are expressed by yarious sets of prime factors. 'These are not, as
a matter of fact, mere arbitrary expressions (although, indeed, snch would have
snfficiently served the object in view), but I have not entered on the reasons which
justify them, as being beside my purpose. I need only further observe that the
equations are not to be considered collectively as representing systems of events (although
they may be selected from such systems), but as individual equations, where a system is
reduced to its simplest form, namely to a single event which from some unexplained
reason is represented in the way given. (7) The following event is an example of this class of phenomena.
