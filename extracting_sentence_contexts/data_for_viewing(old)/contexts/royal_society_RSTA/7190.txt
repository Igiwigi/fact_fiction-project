This ‘plastic pattern’, since it involves local values of 0, 4, y, differs for different points;
moreover it applies, strictly, only to infinitesimal y-increments. On both accounts the

relaxation process may be laborious, but in fact (as in earlier papers) the labour was not
found prohibitive. A use of inexact ‘patterns’ saves time and does no harm provided that exact
account is kept of the ‘residuals’ (Southwell 1946, §170).

28. Starting from the elastic solution (§23) a normal procedure will bring to zero all
F's, as given by (51), which initially are positive; where they are negative the strains are
still elastic, so (51) must be replaced by (50), figure 8 by figure 6. Both patterns will be
utilized, because changes made in x within the plastic region will, according to (50), entail
‘residuals’ at points on the other side of the plastic-elastic interface, and these too must be
liquidated.

It has been shown that every stress has continuity across an interface, and it can be deduced
that y, 0y/dx and dx/dy are also continuous; so (in our approximation) the ends of any string
