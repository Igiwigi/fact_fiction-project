Heer described this species as the commonest fossil at Kik. The specimen shown
in Heer’s fig. 17, Plate XLIV (68), as an axis bearing leaves of Pinus Crameri is very
obscure ; it is impossible to recognise the collar at the base of the lateral branches seen
in the drawing. In all probability the fossil is part of a large Fern leaf. I was unable
to find the original of Hrmr’s fig. 18.

The extraordinary abundance of the leaves of this species in the shale of Kik and
elsewhere reminds one, as Hzer says, of the carpet of Fir leaves in a modern forest.
We still lack information on the habit of the shoots and reproductive organs. ScHENK
examined some of Hrer’s specimens and noticed a resemblance to Sciadopitys in cuti-
cular structure. Later Hatie confirmed ScuEenk’s opinion and added considerably to
our knowledge of the leaf structure. The material collected in 1921 does not enable me
to add anything to the facts already published ; the length of the xeromorphic leaves
varies from 5 to 12 mm. and the breadth from 1-5 to 2 mm.

The variation in length of specimens from Kiik is from 40 to 26 mm. and from 2 mm.
to 1-25 mm. broad. The structure has been described by Haute. Mr. Harris, found
lateral protuberances on the papillee in this as in the other species. The species is
