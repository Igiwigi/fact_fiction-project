the heart, the retention of the ductus caroticus and arteriosus, and the position of
the posterior cerebral vein. In this last matter, Sphenodon resembles both the
higher and lower Vertebrates, while the Lacertilia have departed from this condition.
Also, there does not appear to be any primitive condition in the vessels of any
Lacertilian that is not also found in Sphenodon; and yet, again, in its intra-cranial
vessels it gives a suggestion of the conditions realised in the Chelonia and the
Crocodilia, which is just what might be expected of a primitive form.

The fact that Sphenodon resembles the Lacertilia in certain respects, not alone in
the blood vessels, as Bepparp has pointed out, does not, I submit, justify its inclusion
in this order any more than its likenesses to the Urodela, which are many, demand
its being placed with them. Indeed, the fact that Sphenodon has structures to be
found in various Lacertilians, but not all in the same species, or even in the same
genus, seems to suggest, and rather forcibly too, that when such characters are
encountered in one of the Lacertilia it indicates that, in this particular respect, the
Lizard has retained a primitive condition which is present in the Tuatara, and that
the latter animal is more primitive than any of them. The Lacertilia differ among
themselves in the disposition of their blood vessels, but when they do it is the result
of modification or specialisation ; whereas practically always when Sphenodon differs
from them it will be found to be in a way that either suggests conditions in other
Reptiles or most frequently approximates it more nearly to the Urodela.
