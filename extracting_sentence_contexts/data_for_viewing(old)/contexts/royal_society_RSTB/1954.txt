As regards the large oosphere-like bodies in Fucus with two (or more) nuclei, which
have been taken by Benrens* for fertilisation stages, we have referred to them in our
previous paper, and they require no further discussion here beyond a mere reiteration
of the fact that they certainly represent either abnormally developed oospheres or
oogonia. (See figs. 45 and 46.)
< After fertilisation of the egg of Fucus or of Ascophyllum has taken place, a remark-
@ble change comes over the structure of the protoplasm. Whereas before this event
the cyptoplasm exhibited a somewhat frothy character, and its chromatophores and
§ther bodies of an undetermined nature (physodes, granules, &c.) were irregularly
distributed through it, the foam now assumes a more orderly appearance. The wails
@f the spaces being orientated with a distinct reference to the centrally placed
Aucleus, the general impression conveyed is that of a radially arranged structure,
gpd this is specially due to the fact that the large chromatophores, which lie in the
am walls, or at the angles where foam cavities abut on each other, for the most part
-Zome to lie with their longer axes directed from the nucleus towards the periphery of
the egg. The alveolar structure of the protoplasm is very well shown at this stage,

though it is, perhaps, not identical with the structure described by Birscuntt for

rotoplasm. We say this because the cavities are so much larger than were contem-
‘Plated by the writer just mentioned, who expressly states that these coarse foams are
“hot to be confounded with those which he was considering. But whether this be so
Sor no (i.e., whether the foam structure of Biscuit is actually present in the walls
“pf the large alveoli, a view which we do not put forward), there is no question at
