structure. Of course it might be found useful, for the explanation of physical
phenomena, to assume that corpuscles of some sort are generally distributed between
bodies of gross matter, thus forming an ether in a secondary sense. The ancient
controversy concerning action at a distance becomes irrelevant in these concepts. In

one sense there is something, not mere space, between two distant corpuscles, namely,
the objective reals possessed in common; in another sense there is a direct action
between two distant corpuscles not depending on intervening corpuscles. In fact, the
premises common to both bands of disputants are swept away.

The Essential Relation.—In both of the Concepts IV. and V. the essential relation
(R) is a pentadiec relation, and has for its field both the class of instants of time and
that of linear objective reals, that is, in Concept V. the field is the complete class of
ultimate existents. The proposition Ri(abcdt) can be read as the statement that the
objective real a intersects the objective reals b, ce, d in the order bed at the instant t.
This conception of ‘the intersection in order of three linear objective reals by a
fourth at an instant of time” must be taken as a fundamental relation between the
five entities. But the properties of the relation are not to be limited by the
suggestion of the technical name “ intersection.” The axioms will be so assumed
that Ri(abedt) implies that a, b,c, and d are distinct. Also, when points are defined,
