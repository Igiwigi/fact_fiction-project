On clearing a flower with potash, it is easy to see that the bundles supplying the
lateral stamens appear to come away from the central system at a level definitely
lower than those supplying the other four, in fact, 0°18 mm. below them. Again,
the lateral members were said to arise slightly earlier in development. On these
facts the supposition was put forward that the andreecium was to be regarded as a
(2+4) type (StraAsBURGER, 1872). Another view, originating with McNap (1872, p. 512), suggested that the six
stamens were better regarded as two sets of three, or two single stamens with three
branches bearing anthers ; as a matter of fact, the branches do run up the sides of
the staminal tube in widely spaced sets of three along the angular edges, and
McNav's figures, as also those of SrrasBuRGER, apparently so clearly support this
view that it has been since generally accepted without question (PEARSON, 1908) ;
while Ligier and Tison have endeavoured to support the view by exhaustive study
of the vascular system of the adult flower, in order to make it fit in, as an androecium
of two lateral stamens, with their views on the five-whorled decussate flower. In dealing with this class of evidence it must be remembered—

(1) That the secondary supply of vascular tissue to members already in existence
does not necessarily denote morphological origins ; while the vascular supply of a
secondary zone of growth (as a staminal tube) does not necessarily repeat that of the

original free members.
