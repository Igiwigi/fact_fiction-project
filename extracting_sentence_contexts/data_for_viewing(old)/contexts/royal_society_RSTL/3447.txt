ScnrLeIDen, I refer to what has been above stated regarding the changes in appear-
ance presented by the nuclens, from the resolution of its onter portion into cells, and
the continual origin in the interior of the foundations of new cells, and hence the vary-
ing size of the central pellucid cavity (par. 327.) ; believing that the apparent growth
and diminution, and the final * absorption of the nucleus,‚Äù supposed by ScnLeipen, as
well as the nature of his nucleolus, are to be thus explained. If 80, however, it will
be seen that the formation of the nuclens precedes that of the nucleolus, instead of
being consequent upon it, as supposed by ScHLEDENTf. There seems, in fact, to arise
at the surface of the nucleus a snccession of objects, each of which, in turn, is a nu-
cleolus: and this after the formation of the cell. More particularly considered, the
process 8eems to be as follows. The progressive resolution of the germinal spot into
layers of incipient cells, has shown us that the formation of each snccessive layer is
preceded by a finely granular appearance, the latter surronnding a pellucid fluid.
It seems to be in this finely granular part that the discs or incipient cells come into
view (Plate XXIV. fig. 192.). On the enlargement of the latter, an inner part, pre-
viously pellacid, is found to have become finely granular; but this also surrounds a
pellucid central fluid, and 80 on. It would thus seem that the central pellucid fluid
becomes finely granular. The evyer-varying appearance called the nucleolus, I appre-
hend to arise from the refraction of light; the degree of which, and the particular situ-
ation in which it occurs, depend chiefly on two circumstances, namely, the condition of
