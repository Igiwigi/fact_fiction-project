with an observation made by Lrverme, quoted by Huaers* in a paper entitled
“The Relative Behaviour of the H and K Lines of the Spectrum of Calcium,” who
states that when calcium occurs as an impurity in a carbon are the H line sometimes
appears by itself.

The negatives that had previously been taken in the region ) 4000 to d 4600 were
examined for the calcium line at 4226, but only a trace of it was discovered, and
then only in the comparison spectrum, on photographs at 10 and 20 atmospheres. It
is unfortunate that the H, K, and g lines were not upon the same plate, as they might
have contributed to our knowledge of the origin of these lines under different
conditions of density. The conclusion arrived at by Huaarns,* and later by
Barnes,{ that the H and K lines are produced by a rare vapour of calcium and the
g lines by dense vapour is not confirmed by the fact that H and K appear far more
readily at +5 atmospheres than they do at atmospheric pressure. But possibly the
above results are vitiated by the localisation of an impurity, as has already been
suggested.
