The proof of (3.42) uses a TT* argument, which is a standard tool to prove L? bounds for 1B
Fourier integral operators. This argument depends on a key non-degeneracy property of the :
function ®, more precisely on what we call the restricted non-degeneracy condition aa)

This condition, which appears to be new, can be verified explicitly in our case, when | |& — n| — :3

HE -—nl-yvol * 2"), but our argument can tolerate vanishing up to order 1.

The non-degeneracy condition (3.43) can be interpreted geometrically: the non-degeneracy of
the mixed Hessian of @ is a standard condition that leads to optimal L? bounds on Fourier integral
operators. In our case, however, we have the additional cut-off function y<,((&,7)), so we can
only integrate by parts in the directions tangent to the level sets of ©. This explains the additional
restriction to these directions in the definition of Y in (3.43).

Given the bound (3.42), one can control the contribution of small modulations, i.e.

p-x<-yZ Tem. (3.44)
