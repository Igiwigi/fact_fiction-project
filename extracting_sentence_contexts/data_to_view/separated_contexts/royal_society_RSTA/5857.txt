The results
shown in figure 2 are similar to those obtained in [26] (with random values of the risk factors),
although numerically different. Keeping the constraint of wealth conservation, economic mobility is only possible through
exchanges. Owing to this fact, a good indicator of social mobility is the averaged wealth

Figure 3a represents liquidity as a function of A and p. As with the Gini index map, there is
no monotonic behaviour in terms of both variables here. In figure 3b, we plot the values of the
Gini index vs. liquidity, where each point corresponds to a couple of values of 4 and p.
