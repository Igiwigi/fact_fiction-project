The total difference between the extremes of the three inorganic acids is an average
of 17'27, » «

The difference between chloride ana bromide in the potassium salts is 26", and
between bromide and iodide 2:5”; the total difference between the chloride and
iodide in both potassium and sodium salts being 5:1”. Two facts are brought out by
these numbers : first, that the bodies containing the greatess amount of energy offer
the least resistance in the tube—for instance, nitrates all flow fastest, and sulphates,
which are fully exhausted compounds, flow slowes ; the second fact is that the greater
the mass the les resistance does it, offer. We ee this in the cases of the chlorides,
bromides, and iodides, the last having the highest combining weight, and hence the
greatest chemical mass, flow much easier than either of the others. Let us now
examine the metals.
