axes of the five-letter words were found to subtend at the observer’s eye an angle of about
12 min. of arc, so that the length of the image of such a word on the retina would be about
16 cone units. Now this is approximately the length of the horizontal arms of T so that

: This provisional plan of the fixation area of the fovea and the T-shaped sensory region
which it contains agrees in a satisfactory manner with the experiments of Vernon (1930)
on the movements of the eyes during reading. She confirmed the fact that, instead of moving
steadily along a line of print, the eyes perform a series of small jerks, with pauses between
the jerks during which the eyes remain stationary. According to the cluster hypothesis
these pauses enable fixation to occur, and this is accompanied by the perception of the
exact shapes of the letters as their images fall on the horizontal limbs of the area with
maximum acuity for green rays. As pointed out previously (§ 6, p. 527) these rays play
the major part in vision by white light because the red rays and the blue rays form
diffuse unfocused images owing to the chromatic aberration of the eye.

X. THE MICRO-STIMULATION OF THE HUMAN RETINA

Micro-stimulation consists in applying to the human retina, narrow, accurately focused pencils of
light. A special apparatus has been designed for this purpose, which is composed essentially of a
