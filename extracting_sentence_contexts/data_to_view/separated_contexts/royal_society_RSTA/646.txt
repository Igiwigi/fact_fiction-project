Indeed, even in quantum experiments, one could make any predictions one a
likes or must in view of one’s prior experience, which need not be based on quantum mechanics : 8
or physics in general. However, the question is that of the effectiveness of our predictions in DNS
physics, of who will do better in physics, in predicting, betting on, the outcomes of experiments. : z
Consider, again, the double-slit experiment. One will ‘win’ with quantum mechanics in hand :s

against those who do not know it or whose theory is not as good, but one would win, or would
not consistently lose, only in many trials, which fact implicitly contains statistics. This is far from
insignificant and is a powerful reason to use quantum mechanics for predicting the outcomes of
quantum experiments. My point is only that quantum mechanics, in general, offers one no help
in betting on the outcome of a single experiment, because one cannot rigorously predict what
happens, although quantum mechanics can do so in practice in some experiments.
