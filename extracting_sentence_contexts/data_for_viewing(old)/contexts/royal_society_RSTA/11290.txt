two layers. In the outer J — «’J’ is negative, whilst J is negative between dj and dj’,
positive between A{? and d)”. Referring to fig. 2, Plate 1, let the point p where the
parabola cuts the J curve be given by 0’, corresponding in the aggregate to a distance

from the centre \w =’ or 7 = x a. It is clear that J (A) and J (X’) are of the same

sign. Hence, if d lies between )j? and Xf? (corresponding to P between Q, and R,),
\ lies between ){! and df, whereas if \ lies between d” and XP, dX’ lies between 0 and
\Y—or, taking closer limits still, between 7 and \{?. We find, therefore, the follow-
ing results.

III. P between Q, and R,. In the inner spherical nucleus the vortex lines lie on
the same side of the stream lines as the meridians—they are, in fact, exactly similar
to the second category. At the boundary between the central nucleus and the outer
layer ¢ = 0, the stream lines coincide with the meridians, In the outer layer the
stream lines lie on the other side of the meridian, with the vortex lines beyond. When
P coincides with R, or \ is the second \, parameter the stream lines coincide with the
vortex lines again, but on the opposite side of the meridians.

IV. For P between R, and Q., we get still two layers, the boundary being given

by (say) \’ (P at p), where JX’ and JA are both positive. J — a°J’ is positive between
