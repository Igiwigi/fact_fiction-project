The suggestion that no fusion of plates takes place is only tentative, and may not be
true. he difference existing between areas 1 and 4 (see fig. 5) cannot be due entirely
to the fact that area 4 is bounded on either side by two ambulacral columns belonging
to the second series—namely, IVb and Va—while area 1 is bounded by one column (Id)
of the second series and one (IIa) of the first series. The difference between the two
series of ambulacral columns is slight, and would not alter the inter-ambulacral plates to
a very marked extent. This is clearly seen in the case of areas 2 and 3 (fig. 5).
