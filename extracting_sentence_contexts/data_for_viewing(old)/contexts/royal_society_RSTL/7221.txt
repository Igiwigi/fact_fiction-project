together with the temperatures of the thermometers, the one ('T) in the box, that (Ty)
reaching halfway up the exposed column, and the one in the balance-case. These
thermometers were connected as already described in Part I. 'The thermometer (T)
in the box was read off at a distance by a second observer through a telescope. All |
these data being noted down, a second and third weighing was made, and as the tempe-
rature only altered one- or two-tenths of a degree during the time, it was easily seen
whether the weighings agreed with each other; and if this were not the case, fresh
weighings were made, and often when these again did not agree, it was found that a
small particle of dust had attached itself to the wire in the water; in fact this occurs very j
often, s0 that, after the weighings are finished, great care was taken to see whether any
dust was hanging to the fine wire. Having finished the observations at the one tempe-
rature, the cylinder was taken out of the box, the water brought to boil, and kept
boiling again for half an hour, and in the same manner as before, the weighings, &c.
repeated, and 80 on for each different temperature.

The balance was carefully adjusted, 80 that 50 grms. in each pan might be changed
without showing the slightest difference in weight. 'The weights were from time to
time compared with each ; the 50 grms. being correct according to the Kew Standard,
any alteration found in the smaller weights was allowed for. At least once a day, and
with some experiments after each obseryation, the barometer and thermometer placed
by its side were read off for the reduction of weights to vacuum.
