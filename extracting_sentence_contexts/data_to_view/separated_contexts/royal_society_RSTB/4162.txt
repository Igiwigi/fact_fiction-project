A sketch of the phylogenetic development of the Cynognathid palate and
a epipterygoid are given. The important features are :—
a (i) The articulation of the pterygoids with the lower surface of the basipterygoid
processes, which they completely cover in the later forms.
(ii) The development of a posterior process from the epipterygoid, which in later
types reaches back to pass in front of the quadrate.
(iii) The complete loss of the quadrate ramus of the pterygoid in the later forms.
24, Ornithorhynchus is shown to agree with Echidna in having a “mammalian”
and an “ Echidna” pterygoid.
a 25. Many facts combine to show that the external part of the ala temporalis which
\ arises independently in many mammals is homologous with the pars palatina of the
; palato-quadrate cartilage.
