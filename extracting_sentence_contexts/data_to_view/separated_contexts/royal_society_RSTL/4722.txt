The chief difference arises from the
circumstance, that, whilst in the latter the two inferior plates (28 7) are separated by
an intervening prolongation of cartilage, in the former (41 d) they have been united
from the first. The substitution of the one kind of bone for the other in the two
cases is an interesting fact. After baving thus acquainted myself with the structure and growth of the bones
of the Pike, I pursued the same plan in reference to the bones of a number of other
osseous fish, into the permanent composition of whose skeletons a much smaller

amount of cartilage enters. In the skeleton of the Perch (Perca fluviatilis, L1NN.), 1 found that nearly all the
bones, excepting the vertebre, exhibited similar conditions to those existing in the
Pike, modified only by the greater extent to which the cancelli have encroached upon.
