To see this, fix a background (M, J) and also choose a particular real-valued solution


¢ € C™(M) to the classical equation of motion. Now define a map xg :./(M, J) > /(M,0) by

Koop (= Pano) + ({, fod vol) Lesans) (2)

and «1.(m,J) =1<(m0). One may check that this map on generators is compatible with the
relations of the two algebras! and therefore extends to a morphism in Alg; in fact, it is an
isomorphism, with inverse defined on generators by

Ke Po (f) = Pann f) — (Rc d vol) Lemp:

As the algebras </(M,J) and «/(M,0) are isomorphic, they carry no specific information about
the background source J.2 Note, however, that xs depends on the special choice of a particular

solution ¢, and there is no canonical way of choosing such a solution in a general background. : =

Developing this point a bit further, let 4 ¢R and define a functor %, : LocSrc — LocSrc so that : >
246(M,]J)=(M,AJ) and so that, if w:(M,J)—> (M’,J'), then 4%(w):(M,AaJ) > (M’,AJ') has the [3
same underlying map as yy. Then the functor 4 := .o/ o %, : LocStc—> Alg is a new theory, which : =
assigns algebra 4 (M,J)=.%/(M,AJ) to the background (M,J); namely, ~ is the theory of D8

4,(M, J) are isomorphic for each background.
