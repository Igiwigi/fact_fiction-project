The same arrangement with regard to the distribution of the nerve-fibres is observed
here as elsewhere, The fibres of the network are composed of numerous very fine fibres. Not one individual fibre can be followed for any distance; but certain delicate fibres can be
traced from one compound fibre to another, in precisely the same manner as the coarser
fibres can be followed ina plexus. In fact, from all that T have observed in examining the
finest, branches of the nerve-fibres in various tissues, I cannot but conclude that the general
disposition of these finest fibres is the same_ as that of the coarser trunks and fibres. In paszing from the trunks towards the ultimate distribution, it might be said that we

posed of more than a 8ingle fibre. . The chief differences observed between the arrangement of the nerves in the muscular
fibres of the mouse, described by me in the Philosophical Transactions for 1860, and those
of the frog, are, that the fibres are much finer in the latter than in the former, and the fibres
themselves, and the nuclei in connexion with them, are much more abundant and closer
together in the mouse than in the frog.
