The largest valve, a right one, is only 16 mm. long and 12 mm. high at the umbo.

Were it not for the crushing to which the deposit has been subjected by the weight of
the overlying lavas, it is probable that larger specimens would have been discovered.
As it is their absence may perhaps be accounted for by their greater liability to damage.

This is a very distinctive species which is so far only known from the Kaiso deposits of
Lake Edward and Lake Albert. It is therefore most suggestive of some relationship
between the early molluscan faunas of Lake Rudolf and that of the western rift valley.

In conclusion I would remark that nowhere have any of the foregoing three species
been found singly, but always in association with each other. What is even more
important is the fact that where they are found in a deposit, there is so far no record of
their occurring with any species of the later nilotic fauna which now occupies the lake
basin.

A Note on THE MaGnEsIAN LIMESTONES OF SOUTHERN TURKANA

Mr Championâ€™s record of the sedimentary series 2 miles west of Kaureta Authrui is as
follows:

This sandstone (120) definitely lies between almost horizontal sheets of nephelinite. There is a
slight tilt to the west and the beds are some fifty to eighty feet deep and would seem to be
