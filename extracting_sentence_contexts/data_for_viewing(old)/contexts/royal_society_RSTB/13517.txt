Previous work on human structural variation showed that
the number of SVs was non-randomly distributed along each
chromosome with the greatest density occurring within 5 Mb
of the telomeric chromosomal ends [48]. The pbsv pipelineâ€™s
conservative approach to annotating SVs located towards the
ends of chromosomes means that putative terminal SVs
