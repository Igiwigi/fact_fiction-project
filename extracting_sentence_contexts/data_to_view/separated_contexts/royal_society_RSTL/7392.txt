The
amount of oxygen exhaled by the blood is quite insignificant. |
Exp. TV: In the last experiment it was pointed out that the volume of gas appeared
to have increased after contact with the blood ; this was, however, due to the tension of
the vapour of nitrite of amyl. It is a curious fact that when carbonic oxide acts upon
blood, although very considerable changes take place in the composition of the gas, its
Svolume is almost imperceptibly affected. I hall in a separate paper, devoted to the con-
Exideration of the relation which the volume of carbonic oxide absorbed by blood bears
Sto that of the gases exhaled, point out how this insignificant change in volume can be

explained. At present it will suffice to remark that, smnce the volume of gas does not
â€”change materially, we may bring it in contact with blood, agitate it thoroughly, and then
Stake a fraction of the gas and analyze it without having to wait for many hours to have
Zelapsed, as is the case in the first experiments on the action of atmospheric air upon
Z blood.
