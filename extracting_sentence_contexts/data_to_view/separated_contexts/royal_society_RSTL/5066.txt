brown colour, and the same acid being neutralized by hydrate of lime, yields in small
quantities a salt exhibiting all the properties of nitrate of lime. The latter being
treated, for instance, with carbonate of ammonia, produces a salt which, when mixed
with some strong sulphuric acid and brucine, strikes a blood-red colour, disengages
fumes of hyponitric acid, &. From these facts it appears that nitric acid is present
in the phosphatic acid, the former being produced during the oxidation which phos-

ficiently long treated with ozonized air, produces a salt exhibiting the properties of a
nitrate. M.
