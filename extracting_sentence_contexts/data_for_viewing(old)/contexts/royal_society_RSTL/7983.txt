is also evident in the more hardy C. officinalis. Many other analyses of cinchona-bark
grown at low elevations have abundantly shown that a high mean temperature is adyerse
to the production of quinine. These results, taken in conjunction with those obtained
from shielded bark, seem to demonstrate that sunlight degrades the alkaloids generally,
while heat mainly diminishes the amount of quinine.

It would naturally be expected that, as the barks become thickened with age, the sun-
light would produce a less marked effect; this is exactly what occurs. Up to the pre-
sent time the amount of alkaloids has annually increased in the bark. In the C. 8veci-
rubra this increase. has been determined as carefully as the conditions permit, and the
increments during the sixth and seventh years have been 0-75 and 0-5 per cent. respec-
tively. That some part of this increase is due to the inability of sunlight to affect the
lower-seated tissues, appears certain from the fact that mossing or otherwise shielding the
bark has a less effect in increasing the amount of alkaloids in the older bark than in the
thin bark of younger trees. There is every reason to think that the alkaloids will
increase by annually diminishing amounts until the amount formed is only equivalent
to the destructive influences at work. The growth of the liber and the formation of
woody cells, for the reasons given above, is advyerse to the increase of yield of alkaloids.

In connexion with this subject it should be mentioned that trees of C. officinalis,
- growing in dry sunny spots, almost invariably produce bark whose main alkaloid consti-
tuent is cinchonidine. The trees grown in shade produce more quinine. 'The bark
of trees of rapid and vigorous growth of the same species inyariably contain a large
amount of alkaloid, and an unusually large proportion of quinine. The latter case can
be readily explained by the foregoing principles. The bark of s8uch would be thicker,
