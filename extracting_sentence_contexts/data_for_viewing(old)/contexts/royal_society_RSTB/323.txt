The out-lying cells are well preserved in ordinary bichromate preparations. The degree
of depth of tint assumed by them, in hematoxylin preparations, varies in various
preparations, but not in the same preparation. The differences observable in respect
to depth of stain between cells of the ventral cornu on the one hand, and, on the
other, the cells of CLarxe’s column, are often extremely striking. When large series
of specimens are searched through, these differences are seen to be of capricious
nature, and, I think, of little real significance. Although it will often happen that
the cells of Cuarke’s column, as has been claimed for them by v. Lennossex* and
others, become stained more deeply than, and with an apparently different kind of
sepia tint (in, for instance, “‘ WreicerRT” preparations), to the cells of other groups,
notably of those of the ventral cornu, yet the reverse is quite frequently the case
even in sections from the same levels of the cord. Without, therefore, laying more
stress on the fact than the above limitation leaves, it is, perhaps, worthy of note that
the out-lying cells in the radicular zone are found tinted in the same degree and
manner as are the cells of the vesicular column.

Also, as connecting them with CiarKe’s column is to be mentioned the peculiar
distribution of the out-lying cells in the length of the cord. I have not observed
them lower than the level of exit of the 3rd lumbar nerve-root nor higher than the
level of the exit of the 5th thoracic. They appear, therefore, best seen where
CriarKke's column is best developed. And where, as above stated,t the cells of
CxaRKE’s column are placed, many of them, at least, with their length in the
transverse plane of the cord, so are the out-lying cells themselves. This suggests that
perhaps in upper thoracic and other levels where CLarke’s cells are more segmentally
distributed and lie parallel with the length of the cord, out-lying ganglion-cells, if
