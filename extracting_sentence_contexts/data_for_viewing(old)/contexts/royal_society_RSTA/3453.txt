adopted into most stellar evolutionary models for VMS [57,58], although Chen et al. [59] have
made first attempts in this direction.

Figure 4 involves a set of theoretical computations for mass-loss rates at high Eddington factor
I, relevant for VMS, but they have yet to be tested against observations. In order to test the
transition from optically thin to optically thick winds, it is important to sample the upper IMF,
which is only possible for the most massive clusters in the Local Universe. In the context of the
VLT-Flames Tarantula Survey [60], we have analysed an unprecedentedly large sample (of 62)
of the most massive Of-Of/WN-WNh stars in the 30 Doradus region of the Large Magellanic
Cloud using CMFGEN. The results are presented in figure 5 and in Bestenlehner et al. [61]. The
most notable aspect of our empirical work is that we do indeed confirm the presence of a kink at a

2Note that although there could be other reasons for low mass-loss rates, such as magnetic models [50], the fact that there
appears to be a maximum Milky Way black hole mass of order around 10Mg indicates a Z-dependence is strongly favoured.
