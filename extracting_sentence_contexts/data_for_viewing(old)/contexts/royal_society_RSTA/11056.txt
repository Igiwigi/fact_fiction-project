than those of salts, owing to the high velocity of the hydrogen ion, and in them the
correction for the solvent is therefore smaller. And so to preserve uniformity, the
correction is made in the measurements on sulphuric acid which follow. Its effect
will not appreciably change the general direction of the curve giving the results,

Having thus determined the value of the concentration m and of the conductivity
k of the substance dissolved, we get k/m, the equivalent conductivity.

In order to express the results in a visible form, we may plot a curve with the
values of k/m as ordinates, and the values of a/m (a number proportional to the
average nearness of the molecules of solute) as abscisse. This gives a curve in which
the very dilute portion is not crowded together as it would be if we took the values
of m itself as abscissae, and, moreover, the fact that most of the curves so drawn come
out as straight lines for the greater part of their length seems to indicate that there
are theoretical as well as practical reasons for choosing this method. The form of
these curves is similar to that of the corresponding ionization curves shown in the
diagrams. It will be seen that as the concentration of a solution gets smaller, the
value of k/m approaches a limiting value. Its maximum can easily be determined
from the curve in such cases as potassium chloride or barium chloride, where the slope
of the curve is comparatively small and the limit is reached atâ€™ moderate dilutions.
Tn cases such as those of potassium bichromate and potassium ferricyanide, the maxi-
mum values are more uncertain, and this uncertainty is transferred to the ionization
curves deduced from them.

The maximum value having been estimated, the coefficient of ionization, @, is caleu-
