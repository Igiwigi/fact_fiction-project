parts, it would be no easy matter even to hint at the precise relation between the yalue
of the current and the structure and arrangement of the strata, Mr. Ropgrr HuxT has
kindly furnished me with a geological section of the country between London and
Hastings drawn by Mr. F. D&eEw. Between London and Tonbridge are included, London
clay; Woolwich beds (sand); chalk ; gault (clay); lower greensand, sand and a little
limestone; clay; sand and sandstone; clay. Between Tonbridge and Hastings, sand
and sandstone ; clay and a little limestone. There are many faults also between Ton-
bridge and Hastings. .

Column 1 of Table XVII. contains the values given by the whole length, from London
to Hastings. They differ but little, save in one or two instances, from the Tonbridge-
Hastings values; and are consequently very low in comparison with the Tonbridge-
London values. These facts all indicate the yery notable influence of local conditions,
other than the meteorological variation already noted, over the relative value of the
current in different parts of the plane.

It was a matter of considerable importance to determine with certainty whether the
currents with which I was dealing were in whole, or only in part, earth-currents;
whether, that is, any portion of the observed deflections of the galvanometer needle
were due to electricity collected from the atmosphere by the suspended telegraph wires
that were employed in these observations. To determine this I availed myself of the
assistance of Ashford. After taking observations in the usnal way between London and
Dover, and between Tonbridge and Dover, I desired the Ashford clerk to detach the
wire from his instrument and leave the end insulated. T thus had a wire of 67 miles
connected with the earth at London, or one of 25 miles connected with the earth at
