From the telencephalon arise, according to von Kuprrer, the cerebral hemispheres
and the paraphysis, from the parencephalon arise both the lateral eyes and the pineal
organs (vide von Kuprrer’s fig. 1028, op. cit.), while the synencephalon forms a
narrow segment intercalated between the epiphysial outgrowths and the first
neuromere of the mid-brain.

It is beyond the scope of the present work to enter into a detailed discussion of
this very difficult problem, but I may point out that, in accordance with the inter-
pretation of the neuromery of the fore-brain given by Hr1,* the pineal organs belong
to the third, and not to the second neuromere, the boundary between the second
and third neuromeres being placed much more anteriorly than in von Kuprrer’s
scheme. This seems to fit in much better with the fact that, in Sphenodon, at any
rate, the epiphysial outgrowths arise immediately in front of the posterior com-
missure, which admittedly marks the commencement of the mid-brain. I cannot
help suspecting that the segment which von Kuprrer marks “ Synencephalon” in
Anguis (op. cit., figs. 240, 244) is really the first neuromere of the mid-brain.t

Tt is possible, as already suggested, that some light may be thrown upon this
question by the arrangement of the various paired outgrowths of the fore- and mid-
brain in Sphenodon. Of these diverticula, there arise altogether six pairs: (1) the
cerebral hemispheres; (2) the optic vesicles of the lateral eyes; (3) the secessus
thalami prenucleares ; (4) the pineal outgrowths (the evidence in favour of the
