This may lead
to an inclining moment imposed by the VAWT similar to the one imposed by the HAWT. Nonetheless, having the system elements that for HAWT are in the nacelle (gearbox, generator,
ancillary systems) at the base of the tower can lead to a lower CG for the VAWT system compared
to the HAWT system. Even in this case, despite the fact that the minimum restoring moment is the
same for the HAWT and VAWT, the lower CG for the VAWT will mean a higher contribution to the
total stiffness from the term B in equation (3.1), and therefore a lower contribution is needed from
the terms A and C. Again, this can be potentially translated into a less costly support structure.

(c) Dynamic response comparison

Following the presentation of static characteristics, a dynamic response comparison is presented
below. The comparison is performed for wind-only conditions, i.e. there are no incident wave
forces acting on the FOWTs and calm water is considered.
