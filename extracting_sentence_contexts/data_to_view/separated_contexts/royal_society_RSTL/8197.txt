The s8econd
row of the tarsus, containing the three cuneiforms and the cuboid, exhibits very clearly
the complete homology of the fore and hind limbs. As in the complete manus we have
in the second row of the carpus three distinct bones'(the trapezium, trapezoideum, and
magnum), each supporting a separate toe, and one external. bone, the unciforme,
giving support to the two outer digits (the fourth and fifth), so in the pes we perceive
also an entirely homologous set of three cuneiforms (first, second, and third), each
supporting a separate toe, and one external bone, the cuboid, giving support to the two
outer digits of the pes (the fourth and fifth). Where all the five digits are completely
developed this rule admits of no exception whatever in the whole range of Mammalia ; but
where, as in Ungulata, the number of the digits becomes sometimes greatly reduced, the
relation of the carpal and tarsal bones to the remaining digits is slightly changed, though
all the three cuneiforms are till retained, and I know of no instance where one of
them is wanting. | This persistence of cuneiforms is a strange fact; for in the carpus,
which is. generally less reduced than the tarsus, the trapezium (homologue of the
first cuneiform) is certainly lost in Horses and Ruminants, while its homologue in the
tarsus is 8till retained in a recognizable state. These relations, slight as they may
Seem, are important; we must know all the details and the true homology of the

© question of the cnneiforms again when I come to describe the metatarsals, and

will confine myself in this place to a general review of them in the Paridigitata, and
a special description of these bones in Hyopotamus and Diplopus.
