In the latter, indeed, corneal reflex was observed almost at the last. Z We have only examined the action of the iodides of tetramethyl- and tetraethyl-
Summonium, 8 that we cannot compare their actions with those of the corresponding
chlorides and sulpbates. We have already drawn attention to the fact that their
Fotion appears to differ very greatly from the compound ammonias in which only
Sthree atoms of hydrogen have been replaced by an alcohol radical. In the tetra
Seompounds conyulsant action is .very strongly marked, while in the triad compound
Zammonias ib is much less 80, or may be altogether absent. FH In the case of warm-blooded animals salivation was noticed before death in
Epoisoning by trimethyl-ammonium suIphate, tetramethyl-ammonium iodide, and tetra
Zethyl-ammonium iodide ; it also occurred, to some extent, in amyl-ammonium iodide.
