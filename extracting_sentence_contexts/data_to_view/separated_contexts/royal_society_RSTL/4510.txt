I have said that the origin of the retina is from
the anterior cerebral cell, and that at a future period the optic nerve could be traced
uniting with its fellow of the opposite side beneath the optic lobes. It is in the
anterior cerebral cell that the thalami are subsequently formed, which makes it ex-
ceedingly probable that some of its fibres are connected with it, although the greater
majority may be traced to the optic lobes. These facts I think are of some importance, and prove how deductions formed
from microscopic embryology may be applied to confirm dissections or microscopic
investigations made on the same parts in the mature animal. On the Development of the Membranous Labyrinth and Auditory Nerve. The observations I made prior to my description of the mode of evolution of the
retina will almost apply here as a preface to my observations on the development of
the membranous labyrinth and auditory nerve, for the essential part of this mem-
brane consists, like the retina, of a fibrous lamina formed of the terminal axes,
cylinders of the nerve tubules or of terminal loops of nerves, which are in intimate
relation with a layer of dark and closely-set nucleated cells, not unlike those found
lying between the meshes of the fibrous lamina of the retina; like it also, it may be
regarded (as the following observations will show) as a protruded portion of the
brain, modified s0mewhat in its texture and connected with an appropriate apparatus,
which receives and transmits its peculiar impressions.
