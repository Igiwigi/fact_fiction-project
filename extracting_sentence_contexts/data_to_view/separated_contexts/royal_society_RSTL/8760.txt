In consequence of this slight change of form, the
two halves were now able to swim at all levels in the water, and were no longer
obliged, as on the previous day, to lie at the bottom of the vessel. In spite of every
care these two halves died on the third day, presumably from the want of food. By counting the rate of the pulsations in entire animals, and then dividing these
animals by racial incisions into halyes, quarters, or eighths, in snch a manner that each
portion should contain at least one lithoeyst, and, lastly, by counting the rate of the
pulsations of the halves, quarters, or eighths, Dr. Exe was able to satisfy himself
as to the following very important fact :â€”The swm of the contractions performed
by all the parts of a divided animal was, in a given time, equal to the number of
contractions which had been performed by that animal before its mutilation. 'This
rule, however, was liable to very frequent variations. Portions thus severed and kept without nourishment manifest after a time a progres-
sve retardation in the rate of their contractions.
