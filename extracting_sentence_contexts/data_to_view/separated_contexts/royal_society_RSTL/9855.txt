Still further back on
a plane with the optic radiations to the thalamus, the distance betwixt the same points
is 63 mm., and here the great mass of the projection system no Jonger runs upwards
to the vertex, but immediately upon the emergence from the lenticular nucleus they
bend directly backwards towards the occiput and are therefore exhibited as transverse
sections of fasciculi (Plate 49, fig. 10, F). A limited swpply can still be traced
upwards to the cortex of the onter and upper aspect of the hemisphere (Plate 49,
fig. 10, A). These facts warrant us in assertingâ€”

_1st. In regions anterior to the thalamus the coronal connexions betwixt cortex and
motor ganglia with the internal capsule, arise par excellence from that marginal aspect
of the vertex whose cortex is characterised by the great ganglionic cell formation, and
as entering into the composition of FEerRTER's motor realm.

2nd. That the median cortex (upper limbic arc) has no connexion with the same
ganglia or capsule throughout any of its course.
