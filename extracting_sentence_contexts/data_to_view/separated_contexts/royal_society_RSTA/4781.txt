Spurious poles arise
from triangulations which introduce extra vertices. Using this insight, it became possible for the
first time to see this highly non-trivial NMHV amplitude as a single geometric object. (However,
it should be borne in mind that this polytope corresponds to one colour-stripped component of
the amplitude. The momentum twistors encode momentum conservation very neatly, but the
price paid for this elegance is that, in the total amplitude, each of the partial amplitudes requires
different momentum-twistor coordinates for its expression.)

The polytopes associated with NMHV amplitudes are in fact four-dimensional, living in a
CP*. An extra dimension is added to twistor space to take care of the range of possible helicity
allocations. This CP* geometry was sketched by Hodges [21] and further developed by Mason &
Skinner [22] and Arkani-Hamed et al. [23].
