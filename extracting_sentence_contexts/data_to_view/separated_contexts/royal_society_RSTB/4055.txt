But the species that occur in both zones, 645 with 1505 marks,
are much commoner in both, and show a rarity of 2°3, 7.e. are fairly near to the
level of “Common.” How this result is to be interpreted it is difficult to say ;
whether it is that these species are really specially adapted to both zones, and
have become common in both, or whether it is that they are on the whole the
first arrivals in the country, and that most species can really live in both zones,
or what, we do not at present know; but the facts are very striking. It is also
very noteworthy that in the dry zone there are only 48 endemic species against
