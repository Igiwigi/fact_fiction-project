that fresh animal charcoal, when used in the preparation of rubian, invariably takes
up, besides rubian, a quantity of chlorogenine, which is not removable by cold water,
but which afterwards dissolves together with the rubian in boiling alcohol. Never-
theless, on using the charcoal which has been once employed, after treatment with
alcohol, a second time for the same purpoze, it seems to take up rubian alone and no
chlorogenine, notwithstanding its being, as might be supposed, in the same condition
for again absorbing the latter as it was in the first instance. At all events, the alcohol
dissolves only rubian out of the charcoal, when it is used a second time; and if the
alcohol should till contain chlorogenine, there will certainly not be a trace of the
latter in the alcoholic solution, when the charcoal is used for the third time. That
the attraction of the charcoal for rubian is not diminished after it has been once used
and then exhausted with alcohol, however indifferent it then becomes towards chloro-
genine, is proved by the fact that far more rubian is obtained when the charcoal is
employed for the second time than in the first instance. If the animal charcoal, after
being once used and exhausted, be heated red-hot s0 as to destroy all organic matter
contained in it, it again behaves towards the two substances in the same manner as
in the first instance, that is, it absorbs a mixture of rubian and chlorogenine. It is
therefore advisable to reject the rubian which is obtained from the charcoal that has
been used for the first time*. If a small portion of the alcohol with which the char-
coal has been treated no Jonger gives a green colour when mixed with acid and
boiled, but remains of a pure yellow, it is distilled or evaporated. During evapora-
tion a small quantity of a dark brown flocculent substance is deposited, which is
Separated by filtration, The solution now contains, besides rubian, another snb-
stance in small quantity, which is a product of decomposition of rubian itself, and is
