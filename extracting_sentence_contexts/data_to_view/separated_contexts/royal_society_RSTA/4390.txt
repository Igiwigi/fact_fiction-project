With no such library the
work on tiny cell biomass is meaningless. The first remaining phylotype, hereafter w123-10, proved to be a hitherto-unknown type
of bacterium showing less than 86% sequence similarity to known taxa. Its phylogenetic
assignment to bacterial divisions was also unsuccessful except for the fact that it showed
reliable clustering with the above-mentioned unidentified bacterium AF532061 earlier detected
in accretion ice. The second phylotype is still dubious in terms of contamination. It showed 93%
similarity to Janthinobacterium sp. of Oxalobacteraceae (f-Proteobacteria)—well-known ‘water-
loving’ bacteria, though we do not expect to meet a known representative of Oxalobacteraceae
in Lake Vostok because of its hitherto known physical-chemical conditions.
