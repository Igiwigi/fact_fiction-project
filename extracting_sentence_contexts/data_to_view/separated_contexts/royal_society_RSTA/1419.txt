é If, however, we retain the conception of the mechanically linked graphs, each of which,

a as has been shown, may be either tilted, or lifted bodily, in relation to the others, without

8 impairing its own validity as a record of observations, there is one, and only one, ideal
3 arrangement in which the whole of the graphs can be combined together to give the best
3 possible mean results. This arrangement is conditioned by the fact that in the adjusted
es positions of all the graphs the sum of the squares of all the differences taken for all points,
2 between the values of any point given by any component graph and that given by the

resulting mean graph, shall be a minimum. In the computation the vertical movement and the tilt are provided for by the intro-
duction of two unknowns A and B for each independent calibration. To keep the
magnitude of the quantities in the calculation reasonably small, the diagram of each
calibration is imagined first to be laid down in some position known to be fairly near to
the correct one, and then to be moved up and down, and tilted, so that each point has
its final position changed by an amount A+B. The object of the calculation is
then to determine the “A’s” and “B’s” so as to arrive at the best mean values for the
combination of the whole series of calibrations.
