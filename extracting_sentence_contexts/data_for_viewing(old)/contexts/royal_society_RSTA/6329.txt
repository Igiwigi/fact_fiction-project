associate the FFT-calculated diffraction data from area i and ii with (111) c diamond and (0001)
c/h stacking disordered diamond, respectively.

Similar to (0001) c/h stacking disordered diamond, type 2 diaphite structures give rise to
hexagonal reflections with 2.1 A d spacings (figure 10). We note that the superimposed c diamond
and graphene units of type 1 diaphite would also result in a similar pattern (figure 4). Type 2
diaphite projected along (211) c diamond exhibits hexagonally arranged graphene layers inserted
within and bonded at high angles to the sp>-bonded (131) c diamond surfaces (figure 10).
HRTEM images of type 2 diaphite from the Canyon Diablo hard carbon grains (figure 10) are
characterized by elongated (121) ¢ diamond domains parallel to (131) and subnanometre-sized
regions containing approximately 2.1 A fringes arranged in a hexagonal pattern. Németh et
al. [24] interpreted figure 10a as two- and four-layer thick {113} c diamond twins. However,
the DFT-based structure model (figure 10b) shows that such images are in fact consistent with
type 2 diaphite and indicate that these nanostructures correspond to a nanocomposite material
consisting of sp?- and sp*-bonded carbon regions. Type 2 diaphite contains c diamond, graphene
and interface regions. By changing the volume of these regions, various type 2 diaphite structures


can be generated and identified in HRTEM images (figure 10c,d). Several HRTEM images are
dominated by c diamond and interface regions, and they are presumably vertically embedded
within c diamond. It is an interesting question how their electronic structure and EELS data differ
from c or c/h stacking disordered diamond. As the sample gets thicker, the identification of the
c diamond units becomes challenging (figure 10d). However, the (113) elongation of the domains
and the streaking of reflections are indicative of type 2 diaphite (figure 10d).
