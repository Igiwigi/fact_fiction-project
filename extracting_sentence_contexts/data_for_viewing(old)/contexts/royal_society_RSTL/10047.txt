rom —8' to +4.

— Each observed value is the mean of 40 observations, but it is not stated how far the
Bbservations differ among themselves ; observations were only made for a small number
= values of þ, the angle of incidence, two at most for each position of the plane of

neidence relatively to the axis of the crystal, and the values of þ chosen were 40",
A5?®, 50 and 55%.

Now, it will be seen on referring to my tables, that for these values of þ the
differences there recorded are small. Nothing is said in NEUMANN's paper as to the
method adopted to determine the values of þ' and þ”, the angles of refraction of the
ordinary and extraordinary rays. In fact, they are both indeterminate, seeing that the
experiment, was made with white light. These are the only other experiments made
to test the theory 80 far as it concerns the refraction of light.

The same paper of NEUMANN's contains a series of experiments on the position of
the plane of polarization of light reflected from the surface of the crystal under various
circumstances, the results of which are compared with theory.

The comparison is also extended to some earlier experiments of SrpBROK's.
