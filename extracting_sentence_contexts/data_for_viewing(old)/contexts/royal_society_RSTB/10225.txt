The use of sequence data for species discovery and identifi-
cation is particularly important in this kingdom, because so
many fungal species are both undescribed and unculturable
[90]. The recovery of ITS barcode sequences is sometimes
compromised by intra-individual heterogeneity, reflecting its
multi-copy nature [91], and alignment ambiguities can make
it difficult to establish if the recovered sequence derives from
the target species or a symbiont. As a consequence, there has
been a search for secondary markers. COI has shown strong
resolution in some groups [92], but its utility is constrained
because the introns prevalent in fungal mitochondrial gen-
omes often disrupt its PCR amplification from genomic
DNA [93]. This fact has provoked studies on diverse nuclear
gene regions, such as large and small subunit ribosomal
DNA [94], but no secondary marker has gained broad adop-
tion. As with plants, efforts are shifting towards the
incorporation of wider genomic coverage into barcoding
workflows, creating a challenge to balance between the need
for increased resolution with the requirement for a cost-
effective, highly scalable assay. Another key issue for fungi is
the growing divide between identified taxa and sequences,
driven by the rapid growth of ‘sequences without names’ pro-
duced from metabarcoding studies, and also the need to
increase the proportion of newly described species that have
barcode sequences generated from type material. This parallels
