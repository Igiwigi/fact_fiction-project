and 36, from mitoses in the young petals of Oe. ammophila x (biennis * rubricalyx),
showed in one case no obvious pairing and in the other a large amount of apparent
pairing, while the meiotic chromosomes are constantly in three pairs and a ring of eight.
Figs. 55 and 56 are taken from a single plant of the reciprocal hybrid. In one there
appears to be but little pairing, while the other shows several probable pairs. Hence,
the amount of somatic pairing appears to be variable in the individual and independent
of the arrangement taken up during meiosis.

Discussion.

Pairing and Linkage of Chromosomes.

Several notable facts regarding the pairing and linkage of chromosomes in these
hybrids have been brought to light. â€˜The first is with regard to the differences found to
exist between the two reciprocal hybrids. Although the chromosomal constitution of
these two hybrids is the same, yet differences in morphological structure and cytological
behaviour are evident. When Oe. ammophila is the pollen parent, each chromosome of
the two groups which are brought together finds a mate, with which it becomes paired.
However, in the case of the reciprocal cross, when what must be regarded as virtually the
same chromosomes are brought together, only six of them pair, the other eight remaining
linked in a ring. It would seem then that some important part must be played by the
cytoplasm, which is derived from Oe. (biennis  rubricalyx) in one cross and from Oe.
ammophila in the other. When the cytoplasm of the egg is contributed by the constant
hybrid Oe. (biennis x rubricalyx) 100 per cent. pairing occurs, but when Oe. ammophila
is seed parent then eight of the chromosomes remain linked.
