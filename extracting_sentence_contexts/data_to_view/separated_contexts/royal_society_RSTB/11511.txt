We mention three possibilities. One response would suggest that there are phenomenolo-
gical differences associated with perceptual anticipations of
what one would see were one, for example, to look more clo-
sely—where these perceptual anticipations would reflect the
distribution of credences [77]. It would need to be the case
that this phenomenology was perceptual and distinct from
feelings of surprise or fulfilment experienced when such
actions were, in fact, undertaken. A second response might
appeal to the epistemic emotion sometimes dubbed the ‘feel-
ing of certainty’ [78,79]. It is perhaps harder to maintain that
one can simultaneously experience distinct subjective feelings
of certainty regarding each of a range of candidates.
