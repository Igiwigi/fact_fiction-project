were observed between hydrogels with anisotropy parallel with the magnetic field and isotropic
magnetic hydrogels.

This effect corroborates the hypothesis that not only the spatial anisotropy is important,
but also a strong interaction is fundamental in anisotropic hydrogels to provide a noticeable
enhancement of their mechanical properties. An essential difference between the peptide-based
and the fibrin-based systems studied in the previous paragraphs, and the alginate-based system
of the current paragraph, is the fact that in the former systems, a polymerization process that
results in the effective integration of the particles within the 3D network took place. In contrast,
in the case of alginate-based system, the hydrogel was built by the electrostatic cross-linking of
the alginate molecules, mediated by the Ca”* ions, resulting in the particles embedded within the
polymer network, without the existence of an effective linkage between them and the polymer
chains. Other factors, such as the application of a magnetic field, might drive the appearance of
anisotropy, as shown in figure 7a. Thus, we may conclude that different experimental factors, such
as polymer nature, particle coating or gelation process, are decisive to create a system with proper
interactions and, therefore, satisfactory anisotropy.

5. Conclusion

We have presented in this manuscript three different approaches for the fabrication of anisotropic
