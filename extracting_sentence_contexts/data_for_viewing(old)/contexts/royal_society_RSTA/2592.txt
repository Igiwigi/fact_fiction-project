possibility to correct every error discovered in the text and answer every question arising
in the process.


e Usefulness of a proof has nothing to do with the absence of errors therein. It emerges
from the presence of new viewpoints, new concepts, new methods, new observations,
new ideas, new tricks, new constructions, ...

e By default, mathematicians use as axioms all statements they ever encountered in trusted
sources in the form they remember and understand these statements. Trusted sources are
usually monographs and articles in the main (‘refereed’) mathematical journals. Owing to
purely physical, physiological and psychological restrictions nobody can possibly check
in detail proofs of all facts they use, and oftentimes even thoroughly ponder over their
statements.

5. Apocket bestiary of mathematical mistakes

One evident offshoot of the above simplistic picture of Mathematics is that mathematicians are
ashamed to acknowledge and discuss mistakes, not just their own mistakes, but even mistakes in
the published work of others. They are especially reluctant to mention to their students that even
the classics made scores of mistakes.

However, anyone acquainted with the history of Mathematics, and anyone familiar with the
current state of affairs, is fully aware that mathematical works are swarming with mistakes of
all possible sorts. Of course, one should distinguish these mistakes by how critical they are, how ia
