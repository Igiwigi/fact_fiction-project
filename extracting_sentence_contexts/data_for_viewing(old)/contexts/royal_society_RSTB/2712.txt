Thus both in physical characters and chemical composition the substance of the
Coccosteus fossil, and consequently of Paleeospondylus, is a true coal. That coal
might in some instances result from the decomposition of fish remains has often been
conjectured, but never yet conclusively proved.

These results gain greatly in interest by the fact that Coccosteus occurs in another
and very different state of fossilisation, as for instance in the calcareous nodules of the
Moray Firth. Within these the skeleton has been protected from the effects of
pressure, so that the bones are not squeezed together as in the Achanarras specimens,
but retain a separate individuality; at the same time their organic basis has
disappeared, leaving only the mineral matter, so that instead of being compacted
into a black structureless coal, they are preserved as white clearly defined plates, in
which histological characters are still plainly decipherable. Thin slices under the
microscope are seen to be crowded with the characteristic cavities left by bone-
corpuscles, and to be traversed by numerous minute canals. The corpuscular
cavities are best displayed at the instant when the preparation of the thin slice
is completed by the addition of balsam and a cover-glass ; they are then filled with
air and consequently obvious, but as this is driven out by the balsam they rapidly
