them), is nevertheless followed by much more considerable shock than any other lesion,
even of much greater extent. Indeed it is difficult to keep an animal, on which the
bilateral operation has been performed, alive for more than a few days, even although
it may be got to feed fairly well, for diarrhea is apt to supervene, and the animal
soon gets emaciated and dies. Out of four cases in which we have performed the
bilateral operation at one sitting, two died, in spite of every care, on the eighth day,
and the other two survived only three or four weeks. But even in these last cases
there was no recovery from the paralysis, although the animals learned to get about
and even to climb the wires of the cage quite readily with the use of their arms, the
legs being always used merely passively as props.

The results which follow unilateral removal of the gyrus marginalis are perfectly
well marked, but far less striking. This arises from the fact that the animal is able
to assume and maintain a nearly normal attitude; a result due, no doubt, to the action
of the muscles upon the one side of the spine being sufficient for this purpose.
Rotation of the trunk to the side opposite to the cerebral lesion appears, however,
to be deficient, and paralysis of the opposite leg is always very distinct; the
foot and leg hanging down when the animal is seated upon a perch, and remaining
passive when the animal is taken up by the shoulders and somewhat rapidly lowered
to the ground. Under these circumstances a normal Monkey will always extend
the hip and put down the foot to meet the ground, but in cases with a unilateral
lesion of this description it is only the foot which is upon the same side as the
cerebral lesion which is thus lowered. The hip can, however, be freely flexed, and
the paralysis of the leg-muscles does not appear to be nearly so well marked when
only one side is involved as it is after the performance of the double operation.
