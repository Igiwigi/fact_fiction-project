For example, the strong line 5672 only occurs
with intensity 0 in the sun, while 5684, which is much weaker in the are, appears
with intensity 1 in the sun. These differences, however, become comprehensible when due attention is given to
the properties of the different lines. The lines of scandium which appear most
prominently among the Fraunhofer lines are, in fact, the enhanced lines, and within
the limits of error of estimation they appear with relative intensities which are
identical with those in the terrestrial spectrum. Lines other than those which are
enhanced, even though strong lines in the are, occur only as very faint lines in the
solar spectrum. The coincidences between scandium and solar lines, within the limits of error, are
numerous, but many of them cannot reasonably be regarded as other than accidental.
