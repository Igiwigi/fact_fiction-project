Lot 29, Range XI, Township of Cardiff, Ontario—A very fine-
grained marble, through which are distributed occasional large twisted calcite
remnants, which indicate that the rock in its present form has resulted from the
granulation of a coarsely crystalline marble. The rock bears a very strong resem-
blance to No. 4, but the granulation is more advanced and the calcite remnants less
numerous. The granulated portion of the rock is also identical with that of No. 10;
in fact, No. 10, if more completely granulated, would be identical in character with
this rock. 13. Limestone.
