S be inereased by the coring. It follows, therefore, that the diminution of the P.D.
Â£ between the carbons actually observed with cored carbons must be caused by a
g lowering of the specific resistance of the vapour film or of the mist, or of both; and
& this lowering must be so great that it must more than compensate for the diminution
% in their cross-sections.
S It is easy to see how the vapour and mist from a core in the positive carbon must
& alter the specific resistance of the are, but, since the negative carbon does not
& volatilise, there seems to be no reason why coring it should have the same effect.
The core, however, consists of a mixture of carbon and metallic salts; and metallic
salts have a lower temperature of yolatilisation than carbon, so that these salts may
easily be volatilised by the must touching them, and, mingling with it, lower its
specific resistance.
Now take the fact that, with a constant length of are, on increasing the current the
P.D. always diminishes less if the positive carbon is cored than if it is solid, and that
the reduction of diminution is sometimes so great that the P.D. remains constant for
a large increase of current, and sometimes even increases somewhat, instead of steadily

diminishing, as it does when both carbons are solid.

324 MRS. H. AYRTON ON THE MECHANISM OF THE ELECTRIC ARC.

Every increase of current, whether the carbons are solid or cored, entails an
enlargement of the cross-section of the are, and a consequent tendency of the P.D. to
