By expressing a gene specific to
that location, the cell can create a spatial pattern in the embryo. In the 1980s and 1990s, many
papers were published proving the existence and function of morphogen molecules, and this
idea became the standard for pattern formation principles in morphogenesis [3,8]. In fact, it has
been demonstrated that most fertilized eggs contain morphogen-like molecules and that early
development depends on the concentration of these molecules [8]. The positional information
model is very flexible, and almost any positional information can be formed by manipulating the
position of the morphogen source. For example, experiments have shown that repetitive patterns,
such as the stripe pattern of segmented genes in Drosophila, which seem to be difficult to create
with the morphogen gradient, can be created by combining multiple concentration gradients
of morphogens [9,10].
