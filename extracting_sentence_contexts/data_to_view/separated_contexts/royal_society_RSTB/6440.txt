It is well established that, during the course of embryonic development,

all the cephalic appendages secondarily undergo a more or less marked shifting
towards the median line. Also, the preantennary appendages of Carusius (WIESMANN,
1926) occupy, in this respect, a position much closer to the median line than do the
antennae. In fact, they can hardly be said to lie lateral to the neural swellings, and
yet their appendicular nature is undisputed. From this a more median position, as
occupied by the labrum, is only another step. Moreover, in those cases where the
labrum is paired in origin, it is clearly to be seen that the two labral rudiments at
first occupy a relatively large area of the head on either side of the median line, and
subsequently undergo a concentration towards the median line.
