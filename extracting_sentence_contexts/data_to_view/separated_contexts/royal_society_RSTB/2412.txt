OF SPORE-PRODUCING MEMBERS. 63

The sporangia of Zrichomanes speciosum* have been exhaustively treated by
Prantt. I have made observations on several species of the genus which substan-
tially support his facts; but as Prantt did not give drawings of the mature sporangia,
and as numerous drawings of them have been published by various authors which
do not represent their exact form, and frequently take no account of the orientation,
I have represented the sporangia of 7â€™r. radicans in figs. 99-102, from four different
points of view.
