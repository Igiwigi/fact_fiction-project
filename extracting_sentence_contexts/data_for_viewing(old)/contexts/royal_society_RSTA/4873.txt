particularly important. The increase of ice in the Ross Sea is closely linked to a deepening of
the ASL, which is located in a region of large atmospheric variability. The depth of the ASL is
affected by a number of tropical and high-latitude forcing factors, but it is currently difficult to
quantify the role of each factor. However, the increase in SIE in the Ross Sea is consistent with the
deepening of the ASL and modelling studies suggest that the positive trend in SIE over the last
35 years is not outside the bounds of internal variability of the atmosphere-ocean-ice system.

A priority for further research is to improve the representation of sea ice in coupled models.
Many of the CMIP5 models have a poor representation of sea ice, with large differences in the
annual cycle of SIE compared with the satellite data. However, some of the largest errors are a


result of large biases in ocean temperatures, highlighting the fact that it is necessary to have both
atmospheric and ocean conditions correct in order to correctly simulate sea ice.

While this paper has been concerned with examining changes in SIE, it is not currently possible
to consider changes in total sea ice volume, because there are few measurements of ice thickness.
A modelling study [50] has suggested that the recent increase of wind speed and convergence in
the sea ice zone may have increased ridging production, leading to an increase in volume of thick
ice, although it is not possibly to verify this at present. Hopefully, future developments will allow
sea ice thickness to be routinely monitored allowing the investigation of changes in ice volume.
