It is of interest to check to what extent the simplest mesoscopic quasi-continuum model, providing
only a long wavelength approximation of the microscopic discrete solution, and capturing only
some of its dispersive properties, is compatible with the obtained lattice-scale solution.

If we use the first nontrivial term in the Fourier space polynomial expansion of the linear
operator involved in the formulation of the discrete theory [21,23], we obtain a continuum model
with the elastic energy ‘corrected’ by the strain gradient term. The kinetic energy remains the
same as in the conventional continuum theory and the total energy can be written in the form:

00 2 2 7 yo\2
u in E +(e) — “ (=) Je (4.1)
where the factor a?/12 reflects the fact that the discrete model contained nearest neighbour
interactions only [26]. Note that the strain gradient term appears with the negative sign, which
makes the model (4.1) unstable with respect to perturbations with sufficiently small wave lengths.
However, such unstable wave lengths will be absent in the solutions obtained below which

suggest that the predictions of this model can be still trusted.
The quasi-continuum analogue of the equation (1.1) takes the following form:

u(x,t) do(e) , Ea” d*u(x,t)
