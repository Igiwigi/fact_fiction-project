should be compared with figs. 8 and 9 and with figs. 10 and 11.

I do not intend to proceed without caution to any conclusion on this subject, but it
seems to me quite possible that there was a close relationship between the men who
made the Upper Miocene rostro-carinate implements of Aurillac and those who made
similar implements in Suffolk before the deposit of the Red Crag. The Icenian
flint-workers may have been of Upper Miocene age. It is true that, at present, we
know of no facts placing them earlier than some epoch preceding the deposition
of the Red Crag. At the same time, we do not at present know of anything
which precludes their having occupied the Icenian land-surface in late Miocene
times.

Whilst the facts as to the characteristics of the worked tabular flints of the Kent
plateau, and as to those of the worked tabular chert of the Upper Miocene of
Aurillac, are so little known (since of neither series has there yet been any adequate
publication and illustration), it seems unwise to say more as to the connection of the
Kent plateau industry with that of Aurillac than that there is a good deal of
evidence, leading one to entertain—at any rate, as a hypothesis to be further
tested—the possibility of a community of origin of the Icenian, the Ighthamian,
and the Aurillacian industries.
