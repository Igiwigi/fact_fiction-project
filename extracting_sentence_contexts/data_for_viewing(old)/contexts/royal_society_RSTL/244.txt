(1), then the equality log. (—a)* = log. (a)* becomes intel-
ligible ; since it means that the measure of the ratio between
(—a) and (—1)* is equal the measure of the ratio between (a)*
and (—1)*; but then this argument becomes the same as the
former, and is equally illusory ; for — @ and — 1 are in fact
made a and 1. If logarithms be defined, the measures of ratios
existing between real quantities, then it is absurd to attempt
deducing the logarithms of negative quantities from any reason-
ing on the relation that 1 has to — 1; since there is no neces-
sary connection between 1 and — 1; and, independently of
certain as$umptions, the ratio of 1: — 1 is perfectly unintel-
ligible. Indeed the question admits no other meaning than that
I originally assigned it : if a form demonstrated for positive
quantities be extended, then certain symbols may be exhibited,
which, agreeably to such extension, are called the logarithms of
negative quantities.
