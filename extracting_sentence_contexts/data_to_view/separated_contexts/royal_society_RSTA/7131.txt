Hence the transformation is suited to the equation. In terms of the variables g, ¢ it becomes

where Q,, means 0Q(q, 4) /0q and not, as in (1-1), 0Q(g, 0) dq. The suitability of the trans-
formation is verified by the fact that, on the critical locus (2-2), the coefficients in (2-4) are
regular and those of the second derivatives are not all zero. In general, a single-valued solution Q(q, ¢) of (2:4) is converted by (2-1) into a multiple-
valued function of g, @ with branch points on the locus (2:3). It is easily proved that 0°4/0¢°
vanishes only when sing = 0 or g = 0, +1, so the said branch points are in general simple.
