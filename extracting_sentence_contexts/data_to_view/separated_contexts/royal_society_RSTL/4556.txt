In both these two
conditions, as I have observed in the Rabbit, Hedgehog, Ox, Sheep and Pig, the lower
part of the large left venous trunk is always dilated and muscular, and at the opening
of the coronary vein into it, there is found a large valve composed in some cases of
one segment (x), and in others of two. A series of small veins (pmp), ascending
from the back of the heart, join it at intervals between the valved entrance of the
coronary vein and the opening of the venous trunk itself into the right auricle; and,
lastly, the mouths of these ascending cardiac veins are for the most part regularly
provided with valves, whilst, on the contrary, no valves exist along the continuation
upwards of the large venous trunk, at least in the neighbourhood of the heart ; nor
are valves met with, as a constant condition, in any other part of the cardiac veins
themselves. On comparing, in Man and Animals, the arrangement of these vessels and the dis-
position of their valves, I was led to conjecture that the dilated and somewhat muscular
portion of the coronary vein, usually named the coronary sinus (Plate I. fig. 1, 5s), together
with its large and important opening (z) into the right auricle, as seen in Man and
such of the higher Mammalia as have no left vena cava snperior or left azygos vein,
was 8trictly analogous to the expanded lower portion (fig. 2, s) and auricular orifice
(t) of those additional left venous trunks, as found in other quadrupeds ; and, in fact,
that it was the persistent lower part of the left anterior primitive venous trunk. On this supposition, the coronary vein proper, in Man and the higher Mammalia,
might be said to end in the 80-called coronary sinus, at the yalved orifice above de-
scribed ; and thus its mode of termination, instead of varying in different cases, would
be similar throughout the entire mammalian $eries,â€”the vessel in no case reaching

the right auricle directly, but always pouring its blood, like the posterior cardiac
yeins generally, into a larger venous trunk. The analogy thus indicated between the coronary sinus on the one hand, and the
lower portion of the left vena cava superior or left vena azygos on the other, is ap-
parent, not only in their likeness as to shape and structure and the disposition of their
branches and valves, but also in the similarity of their situation, direction and con-
nections with the heart, and in the resemblance, not altogether overlooked by anato-
mists, of their respective openings into the right auricle.
