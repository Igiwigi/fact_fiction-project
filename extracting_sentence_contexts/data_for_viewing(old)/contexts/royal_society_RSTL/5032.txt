the mantle and expose the areole of the visceral cavity. The fluid escaping under such eircumstances is true;
blood. The smaller Mollusca must, however, with infinite patience, be submitted to microscopic examination ;

the observer must stedfastly gaze until the oft parts are protruded beyond the limits of the ahel, whioh in
nearly all cases is too obscure and impenetrable to light to enable the eye to read the included living fluids.


CHYLAQUEOUS FLUID OF INVERTEBRATE ANIMALS. 645

In every Mollusk* yet examined the blood has been found to be colourless, not
colourless like distilled water, but like very dilute milk. It is more coagulable than
any variety of chylaqueous fluid; and from its viscidity it is undoubtedly more
highly charged with the fibrinous principle than the latter. This fact results neces-
sarily from the circumstance, that it constitates in itself the entire fluid element of
nutrition in the Mollusks, and that it is the eat of direct corpuscular agency. In
this series the blood is invariably corpusculated. The proportion of the floating cells
to the fluid varies however in different orders. In the Bryozoa and Tunicata, these
bodies are relatively scanty. In the Cephalopods they are very numerons. Hereafter,
in the progress of physiology, the law will be established, which recognises a vital
proportion between the measure of corpusculation, presented by the fluids and the
* place* of an animal in the series. One unaided observer cannot adventure apon a
generalization which should have for its basis a multitude of © facts.” It is a remark-
able /aw, which has now been demonstrated to preside over the blood of the articulate
and the molluscan series, that in scarcely a single instance is it the seat of colour.
In all cases except that of the Annelida the pigment is developed only in the cells of
