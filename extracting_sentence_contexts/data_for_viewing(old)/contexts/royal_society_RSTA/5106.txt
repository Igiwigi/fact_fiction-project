Figure 1. My first periodic table [1]; it is quite amusing that my first inorganic chemistry textbook [2] did not include a periodic
table at all. Like many of my contemporaries, | bought one which | proudly hung on my bedroom wall and still have in my office
more than 50 years later. (Photo: Brady Haran.) (Online version in colour.)

After many years as an inorganic chemist, | still teach the subject but my research focus
has moved to green chemistry, devising cleaner and more sustainable ways of manufacturing
chemicals and materials [3,4]. Much of the current work in green chemistry is aimed at finding
non-petroleum feedstocks for organic chemicals [5], but we often overlook the fact that humanity
is facing a potential shortage of many of the elements themselves. Unlike petroleum, the elements
cannot run out, because, apart from helium which can escape into space and uranium which is
fissile, the elements are essentially indestructible. Therefore, it is a question of human activity
taking elements from relatively concentrated deposits and distributing them so thinly over the
planet that they are no longer easily recoverable.

This shortage was recently highlighted by Mike Pitts who produced one of the first periodic
tables of ‘endangered elements’ [6] (figure 2). It is quite a sobering table. Most chemists would
not expect zinc to be more endangered than platinum in terms of supply. The whole problem
is perhaps nicely embodied in recent discussions which concluded that there are probably more
people in the world using mobile phones than are using toothbrushes [7]. The key point is that a
toothbrush probably contains only five or six of the most abundant elements (H, C, O, N, Cl and
