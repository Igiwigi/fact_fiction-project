The Poisson WSG is given by

oo 4

PWS (5x) = D> e~* — P*(5x), (3.6)

c!
c=0

where the P‘(5x) probability distribution function also factorizes for higher dimensions
equivalently to the single Gaussian distribution function as given in equation (3.2). The one-
dimensional Poisson weighted sum of Gaussians probability distribution function P%,(5x) is then
given by

(3.7)

2n(c + 1)((5xa)*) 2(c + 1)((6xa)*)
where 6X is the displacement in one dimension, ((5xq)*) is the second-order moment, Ug is the
mean velocity, c is the number of occurrences and A is the average number of collisions. The fact

that the new displacement distribution function is just a sum of Gaussians makes the calculation
of the new MDLG equilibrium functions surprisingly simple. Thus, we obtain

The A, similar to equation (3.3), is given by

where a? and uj, are defined in equation (3.5). The one-dimensional equilibrium distribution
function given in equation (3.10) is similar to the single Gaussian equilibrium distribution
function in equation (3.4), however, their weighting factors are not the same.
