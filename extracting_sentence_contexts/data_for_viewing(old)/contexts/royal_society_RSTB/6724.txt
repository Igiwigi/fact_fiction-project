from the nature of anthocyanin mixtures lead to the same conclusions. There is little
doubt that, whatever may be the starting point and intermediary reactions in the
biosynthesis of anthocyanins, cyanidin is the aglycone most readily produced by the
plant and by the smallest number of stages.

It is possible that certain of the data in Table VI have some phylogenetic significance,
although there are obvious limits to the conclusions which may be drawn. For
example, the preponderance of cyanidin in the flowers of trees and shrubs in temperate
regions is clearly related to morphological characters. On the other hand, the distribu-
tion of pelargonidin appears to be associated with climatic rather than morphological
distinctions. Nearly all the plants examined whose flowers contain pelargonidin
derivatives originate from tropical or subtropical countries. This observation is interest-
ing in view of the fact that blue (generally delphinidin) is considered to be the
predominating colour in alpine flora (Cockerell 1891). Flower-colour type may also
be controlled by the preference of insects for certain colours. For example, bees are
said to be insensitive to red (von Frisch 1937)

ANALYSES OF GLYCOSIDAL TYPES

(1) The majority of anthocyanins are either 3-monosides or 3 ; 5-dimonosides, The
relative numbers in which these are found are dependent upon the nature of the
anthocyanidin. This is true in leaves and fruits as well as in the flowers, but because
of the comparative rarity of pelargonidin and delphinidin derivatives in leaves and
fruits, flowers only will be considered. The majority of delphinidin diglycosides in
