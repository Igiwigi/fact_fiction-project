For example, the [+/ + +] subset of three interacting + modes (and also for [—/ — —])
is globally conservative and has been shown to lead to an inverse cascade of energy [65] (see [66]
for experimental evidence). It was shown in [67] using DNS that strong fluxes of the + species,
and separately of the - species were observed to almost cancel each other out as one approached
the smallest excited scales of the flow, allowing for a (slow) return to full isotropy at small scale. Furthermore, when restricting the nonlinear interactions of the Navier-Stokes equations to only
one-signed helical modes, it was also shown in [68] that the helicity cascaded to the small scales
while the energy cascaded to the large scales, and in fact, in that case, regularity could be proven,
as in two space dimensions for these bi-directional constant-flux cascades [69]. There are in fact three *separate* constant fluxes in the helicity cascade [27]. To our knowledge,
this study has not been performed for MHD, and it would be of interest to do so.
