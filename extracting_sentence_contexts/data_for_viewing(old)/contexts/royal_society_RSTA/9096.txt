The exact theoretical calculation of K for the aperture of a resonator of the type under consideration
has not yet been carried out as far as the writer is aware; the above experimental determination shows

that it agrees roughly with the value K = 2°50 cm, for an aperture of diameter 2°50 em. in an infinitely
extended thin plate. Reference to fig. 2 of §11 shows that the length of the resonator at position 0 is
not determinate owing to the fact that the face opposite the aperture is not plane. The distance from the
mica diaphragm to the aperture is 11-5 em., not very different from the value of ho required to satisfy
the theoretical formula (i.). For purposes of approximating to the pitch of such resonators for purposes
of design, the theoretical formula (v.) may be employed.

Tt should be noted that, according to the theoretical formula (v.), the resonance frequency exhibits the
same temperature coefficient as the velocity of sound as given by (vi.). In designing an instrument for
use in connection with fog-signals, where the temperature is liable to large fluctuations, the resonance
should not be too sharp.

x The results of Table I. are shown graphically in fig. (i.). The continuous curve drawn through the
Sobserved points is calculated according to formula (v.).
