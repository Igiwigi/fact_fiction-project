It took only a few minutes to check the rate of both frequency standards. Except at
one or two of the most remote stations, where the signal strength was insufficient to operate
the counter, the system worked most satisfactorily throughout the entire voyage.

2:5. ACCELEROMETERS

When a Vening Meinesz pendulum apparatus is used the quantity which is directly
determined is the mean phase velocity of the fictitious pendulum. Since the period of a
pendulum depends on the inverse square root of the resultant acceleration acting on it, the
mean phase velocity observed when the resultant acceleration fluctuates will in general
differ from the value that would have been observed had the acceleration remained con-
stant at its mean value. It has been shown (Browne 1937) that if the period of the fluctua-

tions is long compared with the pendulum period, a correction must be subtracted from the
value of gravity calculated from the observed mean phase velocity given by

where #, 7 and Z represent respectively the vertical and two horizontal components of

acceleration and the bar indicates the time average throughout the duration of the observa-

tion.
