In studying the series of minerals obtained from the interesting corundiferous
localities of Burma, there are three classes of facts which appear to bave a special
significance and to be worthy of study for their important scientific bearings.

First. The association of the various species of minerals in the rocks of Burma,
which contain the rubies and other gems; and the comparison of this association
with the facts observed in other areas, where the same gems occur. This study
of paragenesis constitutes a line of enquiry of great promise to the mineralogist.

Secondly. This association of minerals in particular rocks of different areas is
suggestive of the conditions under which the Burma gems—the corundum (ruby),
spinel aud tourmaline (rubellite)—may have been formed, and the chemical reactions
to which they owe their origin.

Thirdly. Not less interesting than the question of the origin of the ruby and
its associated gems, are the problems concerning their alteration and destruction,
which, as we shall show, have been continually going on, as the result of both
deep-seated and surface action.
