His pitch asked: ‘How do we arrive at
a modus vivendi which will not render civilization a contradiction in terms ecologically?’ (Frank
Fraser Darling proposal presented to Archie Clow 23 March 1969 BBC). In the course of the lectures, he acknowledged his intellectual debts to Malthus, Darwin
and ‘the Gloomy Dean’ of St Paul’s Cathedral, Dean William Ralph Inge’s 1920s writings on,
among other things, eugenics. In his opening radio lecture in the series Fraser Darling noted how
‘governments and United Nations agencies are feverishly carving up the remnants of nature’s

wilderness wherever it is thought possible to grow more food or hold more water for the : =
increasingly articulate hungry millions’. : S

The energy crises of the early 1970s were driven by geopolitical rather than physical resource : 2
constraints but they appeared to confirm the neo-Malthusianism of Darling’s lectures and : &
earlier coverage such as the Panorama documentary strand specials The Challenge of the 60s. _

While the nexus of population, resources and pollution formed the core of factual coverage of
emergent global environmental change issues these were translated into specific themes and
treatments in novel factual entertainment formats. These represented responses to environmental
issues within households and individual life stories. Programming on self-sufficiency and
alternative technology gained a place in TV schedules, tracing purposeful decisions to reduce an
individual's or a community’s demand for materials and energy.
