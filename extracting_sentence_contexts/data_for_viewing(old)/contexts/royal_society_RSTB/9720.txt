realism is constrained by the fact that in absolute terms players
never lose anything. A rare study in a more realistic setting is
provided by a large-scale analysis of the work rate of supermar-
ket cashiers, wherein work rates can be accurately determined
electronically through produce scan rates [68]. Individual vari-
ation in cashiers’ work rates tended to be consistent and
substantial, ie. some cashiers worked considerably harder
than others. Using natural introductions (arising from worker
shift-changes), Mas & Moretti [68] found that the introduction
of cashiers that were 10% more productive on average led to a
4% increase in work rates of slow-working cashiers. By contrast,
hard-working cashiers did not reduce their work rate when
paired with a slow worker. Thus, neither defection (individuals
