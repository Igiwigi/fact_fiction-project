sible loss from the conducting power of app. i.; and app. ii. were left charged to a
degree of tension above half the original charge, it would indicate that oil of turpen-
tine had less specific inductive capacity than air; or, if left charged below that mean
state of tension, it would imply that the fluid had the greater inductive capacity. In
an experiment of this kind, app. ii. gave as its charge 390? before division with app. i.,
and 175* afterwards, which is less than the half of 390%. Again, being at 175* before
division, it was 79? after, which is also less than half the divided charge. Being at 79*,
it was a third time divided, and then fell to 36?, less than the half of 79%. Such are

_ the best results I could obtain; they are not inconsistent with the belief that oil of
turpentine has a greater specific capacity than air, but they do not prove the fact.
8ince the disappearance of more than half the charge may be due to the conducting
power merely of the fluid.

1282. Naphtha,â€”This liquid gave results similar in their nature and direction to
those with oil of turpentine.

1283. A most interesting class of substances, in relation to specific inquetive
capacity, now came under review, namely, the gases or aeriform bodies. These are
0 peculiarly constituted, and are bound together by 80 many striking physical and
chemical relations, that I expected some remarkable results from them : air in yarious
states was selected for the first experiments.
