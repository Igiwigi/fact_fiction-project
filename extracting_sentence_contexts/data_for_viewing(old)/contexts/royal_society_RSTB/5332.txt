324 I. GORDON ON SKELETAL DEVELOPMENT IN

transverse rod is fused to a small branch from one of the “ lateral” latticed rods.
Unfortunately no note was made whether or not it arose as an independent spicule,
but in all probability it did not.

Perhaps the ancestors of the Clypeastroida did not separate from the diademoid
line until a considerably later period than those of the Spatangoids. Two embryo-
logical facts seem to be in keeping with such a suggestion. (1) There is in the young
Echinarachnius a plate which probably corresponds to the suranal plate of Echinus.
No suranal plate is present in the Arbaciide but it occurs in the higher Diademoida,
especially is it characteristic of the young urchins (GorDon, 1926, a, fig. 19), The
presence of a so-called suranal plate in the Saleniide (BaTHER, 1900, p. 306, fig. XIX)
seems at first sight to be a serious objection to the statement that the suranal is
characteristic of the young forms of the higher Diademoida. But Agassiz (1904>
pp. 39 and 40) has shown that the so-called suranal plate of Salenia is intercalated into
the apical system and never becomes part of the anal system proper. Thus this plate
is not homologous with the suranal of young Kchini. (2) That genital 1 is absent in
Echinarachnius is in keeping with the tendency for the formation of that genital to be
delayed.
