grandiceps. This culture had a characteristic aspect from the deep green colour of its prothalli,
the thin margins of which became thrown into folds. From the under surface thick
reddish brown rhizoids were produced, The numerous archegonia had their necks
almost always closed, a fact which points to the successful exclusion of fluid water. Only one or two normally-produced plants originated in the pot, and with these
exceptions the prothalli were grown for eighteen months before any noteworthy
change occurred. About this time (June, 1897), gametophytie budding was noticed.
