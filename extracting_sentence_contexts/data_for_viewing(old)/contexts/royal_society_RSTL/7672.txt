system of intersection, and the number of curves which satisfy the given conditions, or
(as this has been before expressed) the number of solutions, is equal to the number of
points of the point-system, or to the order of the point-system, viz. it is equal to the
product of the orders of the loci which correspond to the several conditions respectively ;
among these we may however have special solutions, corresponding to points situate on.
the special loci upon any of the given loci ; but when this is the case the number of these
special solutions can be separately calculated, and the number of proper solutions is
equal to the number obtained as above, less the number of the special solutions.

10. If, however, the given conditions are not completely independent (that is, if the
corresponding relations are not completely independent), then the &-fold locus, the {-told
locus, &c. intersect in a common («—z)fold locus, and besides in a residual point-system.
The several points of the (—/j)fold locus give special solutions—in fact the yery notion
of the conditions being properly satisfied by a curye implies that, the curve shall satisfy
a true (4+I+&.)fold, that is, a true -fold condition ; the proper solutions are there-
fore comprised among the solutions given by the residual point-system, and the number
of them is as before equal to the order of the point-system, or number of the points
thereof, Zess the number of points which give special solutions: the order of the point-
system is, as has been seen, equal to the product of the orders of the k-fold locus, the

t-fold locus, &c., tess a reduction depending on the nature of the common (4—g)fold
locus, and the difficulty is in general in the determination of the value of this reduction.

11. 1n all that precedes, the number of the parameters has been taken to be @; but if
