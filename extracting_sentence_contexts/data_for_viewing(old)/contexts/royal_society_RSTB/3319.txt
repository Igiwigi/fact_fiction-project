of the grand period of growth of a cell.

Throughout the preceding discussion it has been assumed that the growth in
length of an internode is constant throughout its length, but in reality this is not
the case. An internode often grows most vigorously at its middle portion, but
sometimes the maximum amount of growth is transferred to the upper or lower end.

The fact that there is no essential connection between the grand period of growth
of constituent cells and the internode-curve of a stem is instantly shown by the
internode-curves of branches.

Changes in the Symmetry of Typical Stems.

Ascending the main stem of a herb, or the year’s shoot of a tree, it is not only the
internodes that show a successive increase and decrease in dimensions, but so likewise
do the leaves. And, in the case of the herb, there is a similar change in the vigour
of the successive branches, which, traced from below upwards, often show at first an
increase, and afterwards a decrease, in vegetative vigour, as estimated by their total
lengths, as well as by the number of leaves and internodes.
