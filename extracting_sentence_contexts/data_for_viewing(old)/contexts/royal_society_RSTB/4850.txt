When there is no real correlation it is possible to determine a priori the distribution
of the multiple correlation of any quantity y with any q variates a, 7,,..., %,.
There are many ways of approaching the solution, of which perhaps the most
enlightening is to regard the deviations y—g as components determining the direction
of a radius vector OP in x dimensions. Then q other directions are specified by the ¢
meteorological variates, and any linear regression formula is represented by some line
through the origin in the space of q dimensions, specified by these q directions. The
multiple correlation, R, is then the cosine of the angle which the line OP makes with
the space of q dimensions. If the variate y is unrelated to the variates «,,..., x,, the
line OP may be regarded as drawn at random through O, in the space of » dimensions ;
using this fact it may be shown without difficulty that the chance that R? falls into
the elementary range dR? is

Tt will be noted that the distribution is independent of any correlations which may
exist between the meteorological variates, provided no one of them can be exactly
