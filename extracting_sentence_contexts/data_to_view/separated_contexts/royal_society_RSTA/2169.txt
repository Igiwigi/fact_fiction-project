Spitzer proved this by solving the Kolmogorov backward
equation in a wedge region, then taking the limit of
infinite wedge angle. A key feature of Spitzer’s Law is
that the winding angle has infinite variance, which is due
to the roughness of the Brownian trajectory generating
large winding near the origin [2]. In fact, all positive
