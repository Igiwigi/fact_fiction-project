table 19, in which the total number of man-months spent for both types of work is also
shown to give an idea of the volume of material. The cost in man-hours can thus easily be
converted into cost in money per square mile by multiplying by the appropriate factor, and
money cost per square mile can then be obtained by addition.

Justification of the present approach

267. The fact that the numerical value of g is much less than unity shows that the physical
field in the case of the jute crop in Bengal is definitely of a non-random type. From an
abstract point of view this immediately justifies the use of the theory of grid sampling. In

_ order to appreciate the magnitude of the difference in costs made in practice it is, however,
= necessary to consider numerical examples. Suppose that it is desired to attain the final
© estimate with a percentage error of 1 °% over a particular region of 5507 sq. miles. Adopting
8 the 1941 cost figures and the actual distribution of size and density used in 1941 on a pro-
-€ portionate basis, it is found that the total cost would be 90,652 investigator-hours for the
| © field work. If, instead of using the above size-density distribution, one uniform size of 20-acre
io. grids had been adopted, then the cost for attaining the same precision would have been
. g 239,926 investigator-hours. If 40-acre grids had been used the cost would have risen still
