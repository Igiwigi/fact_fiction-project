Art. (g.) I have found that the coefficients of the n factors of fu in the expression
above given for the quotients possess the property that the sum of their square roots
taken with the proper signs is zero for each quotient except the first (the coefficients
for the first being all units), i. e, D/, +D/jh,+...D;/,=0 for all values of i except i=1. Moreover I find that the determinant formed by the n sets of the nz coefficients of the
factors of fx in the complete set of n quotients, is identically zero, 1. e, the Deter-
minant represented by the square matrix

Art. (h.) It should be observed that U, is the form of the simplified quotients for all
the quotients except the nth (7. e. the last), for which the simplified form, is not U,,
but U,+Z(k, h,...h,), which arises from the circumstance of the last divisor, which is
the final Sturmian residue, not containing z; it being evidently the case that the division
