Tf each of the cells c gives rise to a blastoderm cell, we should expect to find two
more cells in fig. 15 than in fig. 18, but the number is the ame. This is hardly a
safe guide, however, for while the drawings are careful copies from Nature, they are
not from the same egg, and the cells are 80 wedged together that vertical sections in

different planes would not intersect the same number in all cases, and there may have
been two more in fig. 15 than in fig. 18.

T think, then, that the facts indicate that c of fig. 11 is a yolk-pyramid, rather than
a primary mesoblast, and that after it divides into two, as in fig. 13, each part gives
rise to a central portion c, and a peripheral endoderm cell.

If we accept this view and regard he cell c as a yolk-pyramid, two views as to the
relationship between the egg of Zncifer and an ordinary Crustacean egg at once
guggest themselves.

We may hold that Zucifer presents the primitive or ancestral form of segmentation,
of which centrolycethal segmentation is a secondary modification. In this cage we may
guppose that as the supply of food-material gradually increased, new food-bearing cells
or yolk-pyramids were added until all the cells were included, and the segmentation
cavity was entirely filled and obliterated by them.
