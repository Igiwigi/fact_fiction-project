The cases of anastomosis which have been quoted give examples of the procedure
adopted for different conditions. They have not all been cases of traumatic rupture,
but some of them have been cases of neuritis and others of infantile paralysis. Now in
all these conditions spontaneous recoveries are known to occur toa degree more or less
complete, but in any case to as great an extent as most of the recoveries which have
been reported as following these operations. This is the criticism which was put
forward by Heap in connection with one of these cases as quoted above, and, as he
pointed out, much recovery would not be expected in such cases before the lapse
of a year. Therefore an operative intervention during that period as was done
not only in the case referred to but also in some of the others, cannot have the
recovery following it attributed to the operation with certainty. This is a criticism
which is all the more justified in consideration of the fact that the nerve root which
was divided and anastomosed, on examination by electrical stimuli previous to division,
showed in some cases conductivity already or still present. ‘This may be held as
evidence of a commencing or progressing spontaneous recovery, at the dates at which
these operations were done. It is, therefore, possible that the recoveries reported
have been due to this. ‘

A third consideration is suggested in some of the cases where the operation was
undertaken long after the onset of the paralysing lesion. Recovery taking place in
paralysed muscles under such circumstances would be strong evidence in favour of
the recovery being in consequence of the anastomosis, but in some cases this recovery
has taken place so early after the intervention that one is led to doubt that the
recovery is the result of the anastomosis. We know that muscles after long periods
