Hence, in §2, to illustrate the power of the global invariant set in providing
a new perspective on this long-studied problem, we consider a simple analogy: a gedanken
experiment in which, depending on whether a radioactive atom decays, a massive object is
fired into a black hole. We consider the temporal correlation between the size of the black hole
at to, as determined by the radius of its event horizon #+(to), and the (supposed) hidden
variable of the radioactive atom at ft). The existence of such a correlation, even when to < tH,
is easy to understand (without conspiracy or retrocausality) if we take into account the fact that
H* is a globally defined invariant subset of space-time. In particular, like the fractal invariant
set, 7+ (to)’s local properties cannot be defined from the neighbouring space-time geometry
near fo. Two properties of fractal attracting invariant sets in state space are discussed in §3: their non-
computability, and the notion that such sets are, in a well-defined sense, ‘large’ when looked at
from the inside, yet ‘small’ when looked at from the outside.
