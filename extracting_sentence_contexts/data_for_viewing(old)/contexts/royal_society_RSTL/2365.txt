Means at Low Temperature. | 90.3+88.8 26.3 | 52.2

The effects here are not very different with the four needles. The glass
needle and the two steel needles presenting broader surfaces on their sides to
the air's resistance than the copper needle, it was to be expected that the ter-
minal excess with these should be greater than with that needle ; and I am
not aware of any circumstance, except the shorter time during which the
vibrations continued, that should have rendered it less with the unmagnetized

steel needle than with the other two. The principal fact, however, which I
looked to ascertaining by these experiments was, whether the terminal excess
was of the same character here when the temperature was increased, -as that
arising from vibrating the needle successiyely in the shade and exposed to the
sun, when an increase of temperature likewise took place; and on this point
they were quite conclusive, showing clearly, that if the terminal excess is con-
sidered plus in the latter case, it will be minus in the former. It is evident
then from all these results, that if the rays of the sun had simply, uniformly
increased the temperature of the medium in which the needle vibrated, and of
the needle itself, the effect would have been in all cases to increase the length
of the terminal arc, instead of diminishing it, as was invariably the case when
exposure to the rays of the sun caused an increase of temperature. There can
therefore be no doubt that the influence of the sun was not confined to uni-
