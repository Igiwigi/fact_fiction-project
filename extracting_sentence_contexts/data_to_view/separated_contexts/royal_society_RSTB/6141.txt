Puparia also differ greatly from one another, the coefficient of
variation of weight on the first day being over 14 in both species. As to the
limitations of the experimental method, they cannot be precisely defined, for we
cannot say that life in a cage is “ unnatural” because we are so ignorant of life
in the field. But certain facts show that conditions in the laboratory are not
unfavourable to puparia or adults. As to puparia, under favourable conditions
80%, or so hatch, which is higher than the percentage of wild puparia which hatch
in any month (Taytor, 19326, Table I). With regard to adults, at 30° C and the
most favourable humidity, half the female Glossina tachinoides lived 25 days, fig. 3 ;
the duration of life of female submorsitans was approximately the same.
