The great length of the pars occipitalis in this
hemisphere suggests that this sulcus is confluent with the superior parietal sulcus. The superior branches of the parallel sulcus are the first ascending branch (24),
wh ch lies separate in the supramarginal gyrus, the angular sulcus (25), and the
upper part of the anterior occipital sulcus (26) or second and third ascending
branches of the parallel. The hemisphere is remarkable in showing the small
extent of the folding of the cortex of the inferior parietal lobule indicated by the
fact that there are no sulci passing downward from the sulcus intraparietalis and
marking off the three parietal arcades.

$.13.R. (Plate 27)â€”In this hemisphere the ascending terminal limb of the fissure
of Sylvius is close to the lower end of the sulcus centralis. The sulcus postcentralis
inferior (157) arches over the ascending terminal limb and is separate from the
sulcus postcentralis superior (15s). Between these two sulci a small detached
sulcus lies immediately posterior to the middle of the sulcus centralis.
