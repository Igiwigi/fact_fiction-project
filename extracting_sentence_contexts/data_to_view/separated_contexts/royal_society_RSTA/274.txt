Figure 4 plots, for each node, the maximum of 5™ of the EPNs hosted locally at H = 1,2,...,8,9.
(At H=9, AR; was set to 0, bringing the system to an idle state.) We observe that HW (set
to 20%) was exceeded during 4.3<H <6, the period when EPNs were receiving events at
peak rates. This observation leads to two inferences: an intelligent system such as CS is vital to ensure that
RT meets T when EPNs are faced with the possibilities of event arrival rates fluctuating; secondly,
nodes must report both RT and AR to CS in a proactive manner as proposed in §4, not just in
response to significant changes they observe in AR. The latter arises owing to the fact that W
tends to underestimate RT at large values of RT and hence adjustments to existing configuration
are necessary even if a large AR remains constant for nearly an hour.


8. Conclusions

We have described a novel approach to deploying a collection of EPNs on cloud platforms in a
manner such that the response times can be ensured to meet specified targets even when event
arrival rates can fluctuate over time. Novelty of our approach lies in predicting response times
based only on prior calibration and periodic measurements of event arrival rates and end-to-
end latencies of EPNs; there is no need for intrusive, low-level measurements at operator level
within EPNs.
