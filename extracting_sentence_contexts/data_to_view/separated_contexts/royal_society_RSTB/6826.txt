It is impossible to extract the full value from comparing the seed of Williamsoniella
because of uncertainty about fact. Wielandiella is known to have possessed an elongated
seed which yields cuticles of extremely similar appearance (Harris 1932, p. 86). From the
fact that the integument below the micropyle is lined with cuticle and the nucellus is
also cutinized, it follows that the nucellus is ‘free’. It appears to be free in Williamsonia
scotica and may well be so in other Bennettitales, but it is difficult to compare the present
seed compressions with petrifactions. The present account has removed what seemed two outstanding peculiarities of William-
soniella which were the absence of perianth and the simple microsporophyll with pad-like
pollen capsules.
