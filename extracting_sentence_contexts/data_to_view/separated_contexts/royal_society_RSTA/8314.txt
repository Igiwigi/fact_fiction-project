H. WILLIAMS: AN INVESTIGATION OF

along lines across the tunnel (7.e., constant x). One disadvantage of the method of
measurement arose from the fact that the reading of direction depended upon that of
velocity ; consequently in the frictional wake, where the latter reading was very unsteady
and difficult to take, the apparent variations in direction at any one point were probably
exaggerated.

6. All measurements except those near the nose were made with instruments of the
pressure tube type, and are therefore mean values over a comparatively long interval
of time. For the most part readings at any point in the field could be repeated within
less than 4 per cent. on either side of the mean velocity and to about + degree in
direction.
