power of developing stomata, or roots, according to the influence it receives*, The
experiments of Dr. W. F. Epwarps indicate that a decided influence is exerted by
light upon the metamorphosis of the Batrachia ; since, according to his statements,
when tadpoles, arrived at nearly their full growth, were 8ecluded from the influence
of light, but were supplied with acrated water and food, they continued to increase as
tadpoles (80 as to attain an extraordinary size, doubling or even trebling their usual
full weight) without undergoing any metamorphosis . The influence of light upon the

+ On the Influence of Physical Agents on Life, p. 53,â€”The results of the recent experiments of Mr. Hrg-
GINBOTTOM appear to negative those obtained by Dr. Epwarns, and to show that metamorphosis is ouly re-
tarded by privation of light, when accompanied by reduction of temperature. But the remarkable fact above
quoted from Dr. Evwauvs's statements, to which Mr. Hico1xporrow has recorded nothing parallel, shows
that there was some difference in the conditions of the two sets of experiments, which should prevent us from
setting aside those statements, made (as they are) by a most trustworthy observer, until they shall have been
more fully disproved.
