'= 39-86 c.c. — 29-71 c.c.
= 10-15 c.c. N/10 iodine.

Thus, these experiments show that 10-02 ¢.c. M/100 kojic acid absorb 10-15 c.c.
N/10 iodine, producing iodoform equivalent to 2-44 c.c. N/10 iodine and iodide
equivalent to 7-61 c.c. N/10 iodine. The inference from these figures is that one
molecule of kojic acid absorbs 10 atoms of iodine (thus confirming the results previously
described) with the production of one molecule of iodoform (this would require a
theoretical value of 3-0 c.c. N/10 iodine in place of 2-44 ¢.c. actually obtained), and
7 molecules of iodide (requiring a theoretical value of 7-0 c.c. N/10 iodine in place of
7-61 c.c. actually obtained experimentally). It is also obvious that no substituted
iodine derivatives other than iodoform are produced. The divergence between
the experimental and theoretical figures is probably due to the fact that the iodoform
undergoes slight decomposition in the alkaline hypoiodite solution with the formation
of a corresponding amount of iodide.

(3). Estimation of Formic Acid.—The method of estimation finally adopted was based
on that described by Fincxe (1913). The details are :—

To 10 c.c. of a M/100 solution of kojic acid were added 120 c.c. of water, and 50 ¢.c.
of the alkaline hypoiodite solution, prepared as described in the estimation of iodoform,
followed by 5 ¢.c. of N/I sulphuric acid and then 5 c.c. of N/L sodium hydroxide.
The mixture was allowed to stand for 90 minutes, acidified with 5 c.c. of N/1 sulphuric
acid and the iodoform and liberated iodine removed by three extractions with ether. To
