One can easily find that the former workers from GEGENBAUR (1862) to SCHAINSLAND
(1906) had the idea that there are two dorsolateral cartilages forming the dorsal arcualia,
and a ventral representing the heemal arch element throughout the whole length of the
vertebral column. Their descriptions of the formation of the vertebral column can only
tally to a certain extent with the structure of the anterior portion of the urostyle, so
that one cannot imagine that these workers ever cut sections of the actual trunk vertebra. As a matter of fact, ScHwEGMANN (1884) has given two figures, one for the trunk vertebra
and another for the urostyle, and they resemble each other, the only variation being in
their size. In the urostyle region there are two pairs of dorsal arcualia at the anterior portion and
a hypochordal cartilage starts from the beginning of the urostyle and continues up to
its hinder end. It has a bulky posterior portion where there is no neural arch or
cartilagmous dorsal arcualia.
