This series includes experiments with Calorimeter C, using the flattened platinum
strip for heating wire, instead of the central wire conductor and elastic strip. These
observations are summarized in Section 5. The use of the flat wire was found to
produce more irregularity in the heat-loss between the different flows, especially
apparent on the small flows, and no doubt occasioned by the fact that the wire
touched the sides of the tube. The correction for the fundamental interval of
Thermometer E is that given under Group III., in Section 3, Â¢.

The agreement of the value of J with the other measurements is very satisfactory,
and the more so because the heating conductor was changed not only in form but in
resistance. Series 5.
