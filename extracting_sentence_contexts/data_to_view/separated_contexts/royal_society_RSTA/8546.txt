It is clear that the foregoing theory of liquids is not free from objection, and that in
some respects it appears to be less satisfactory than existing theories. The most
obvious objection is that it seems to be incompatible with accepted determination of
the molecular weight of liquids. Since, however, these experiments are based ultimately
on kinetic considerations, the author believes that this difficulty will not in fact arise
unless the requisite bonds between the molecules of each group are found to be sufficiently
strong to cause appreciable modification of the average molecular kinetic energy.

12. Summary of Conclusions.

(1) The ordinary hypothesis of rupture cannot be employed to predict the safe range
of alternating stress which can be applied to metal having a scratched surface. The
safe range of an unscratched test piece appears to be slightly less than the yield range,
but if the surface is scratched the safe range may be several times the range which
causes yield in the corners of the scratches.

(2) The “ theorem of minimum potential energy ” may be extended so as to be capable
of predicting the breaking loads of elastic solids, if account is taken of the increase of
surface energy which occurs during the formation of cracks.

(3) The breaking load of a thin plate of glass having in it a sufficiently long straight
crack normal to the applied stress, is inversely proportional to the square root of the
length of the crack.
