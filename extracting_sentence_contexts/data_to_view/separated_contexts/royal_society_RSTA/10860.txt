Let us, then, suppose that 1), us, Us, uy are connected by two or by three
equations,

F(u;; ts, gt) = 0 (2 = 1,2 or 1, 2, 8):

Now if p,, Po, Qs Qo, are all expressed in terms of p, g, two of their number, and
&), ©, y, z%, by means of the equations f, = 0, fy = 0, the expressions

dy — pid, — pydty, dz — q,da, — g,da,
must both be expressible in the form +

» Aydu, + Agdu, + Adu, + A,du,,

* Otherwise thus—if in the auxiliary equations we suppose fy to have the known value 1%, they become
a pair of linear equations for /;, which must be satisfied by w,, us, %3 now two linear equations in six
independent variables can only have four functionally independent solutions, and one of these is known,
namely, i. (In exceptional cases the two linear equations for v,, us, %4 may be equivalent ; for instance,
suppose fi = pi + fi, %4 = po + qs, fe having any form.) Hence, except in special cases, the particular
complete primitive is defined when one of the functions 1%, ve, Us, ws, or More generally a combination of
them, F(w,, v2, us, us) is known, In the case supposed in the text two such combinations are known,

These two equations, connecting du,, du,, dus, du, taken with the system

the four equations

must reduce to two only. This will be the ordinary case, and we see that if the
forms of F, F,, have been found by any means, the solution is completed without
integration ; the process corresponds to CHArprt’s method of deducing all complete
primitives from one, but it differs in that the functions F,, Fj, are not arbitrary ;
they must, in fact, be so chosen that the four equations last written shall reduce to
two, and the conditions for this are clearly very complicated in general, though in
particular cases available forms for F,, F, may be seen on inspection. In the more uncommon case, when there are three equations

the six equations

must reduce to one only. These two cases are further discussed, from a somewhat different point of view,
in §§ 21—23.
