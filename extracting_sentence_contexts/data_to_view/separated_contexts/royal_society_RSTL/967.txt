AraGo, and recently explained by M. Btor, in a masterly
memoir communicated to the Academy of Sciences, on the
hypothesis of a force inherent in its molecules independent
of their state of aggregation, by which they communicate a
rotation in an invariable direction to the axes of polarisation
of the luminous rays. And this analogy is partially supported
by the fact, that the tint developed along the axis, descends
in the scale of colour as the thickness increases.

A more scrupulous examination however will show, that
its origin must not be. sought in any, cause of this nature,
for (not to mention the impossibility of explaining the phe-
nomena of the virtual poles by this hypothesis) if we place the
principal section of the crystal in the azimuth zero, the extra-
ordinary image will be found to vanish completely for every
angle of incidence, and whatever be the thickness of the plate.
