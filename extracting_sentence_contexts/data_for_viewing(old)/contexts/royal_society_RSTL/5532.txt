- substituting these values in the first equation, we obtain the resultant of the system.
But this resultant will 'also be obtained by substituting, in the third equation, a system

of simultaneous roots of the first and second equations, and equating to zero the product
of the functions 80 obtained*. We must have therefore

and equating the coefficients of &*, (3, 4%, we obtain the above-mentioned relations.
