no definite statement as the preservation of the inside of the heart was not good
enough to settle the point satisfactorily.

Trunci Arteriosi (text-figs. 1 and 2).â€”The arterial trunks, as has been noted, come
off from a slight projection of the ventricle which is probably to be regarded as a
remnant of the conus arteriosus. The three trunks, each guarded by a pair of deep
semi-lunar valves, present certain points of interest. Viewed externally there appear
to be three vessels from the commencement. These are the left systemic trunk,
lying ventrally to the right, a right systemico-carotid trunk (i.e., the vessel from
which arise the right systemic arch and the two common carotids), lying dorsally and
slightly to the right and the pulmonary arch, lying to the left side somewhat dorsally
but just visible at the base of the ventricle from the ventral side. A reconstruction
revealed the fact that the internal separation of the trunks was not complete, a point
that was afterwards verified by careful dissection. At the base the three vessels stand

in open communication with one another and pass backwards a short distance before
their common lumen opens into that of the ventricle, and behind this again lies the
atrio-ventricular aperture. This is, I think, the portion to be looked upon as the
remnant of the conus arteriosus, and although only short is nevertheless quite
distinct, and as it bears at its base one pair of semi-lunar valves obviously cannot
be considered as part of the ventricle.
