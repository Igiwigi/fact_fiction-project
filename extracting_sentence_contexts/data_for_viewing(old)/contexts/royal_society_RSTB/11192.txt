One contribution of 11 to a theme issue reputation of the individual whose scholarly activities this issue celebrates,
‘Perspectives on the ribosome’. Venki Ramakrishnan, derives from the many memorable contributions he has
made to our understanding of its structure and function.

Scientifically, the history of the ribosome is quite old (see [1,2]). The word
‘ribosome’ (ribose-containing body) was coined nearly 60 years ago, after it
biochemistry, cellular biology, had been discovered that the cytoplasms of virtually all cells contain large num-
molecular biology, structural biology bers of particles that are rich in RNA, but before the role of these particles in

protein synthesis had been properly understood [3]. By the mid-1960s, the fol-

lowing facts had been established: (i) that the ribosome is a polymerase-like

enzyme capable of catalysing the synthesis of proteins of any sequence whatever

(more or less), (ii) that it consists of two, non-equivalent ribonucleoprotein sub-

units, one of which is about twice the mass of the other, (iii) that its substrates

by the interactions between aminoacyl tRNA anticodons and messenger RNA
codons that are mediated by the small subunit.

Even though many aspects of the biochemistry of protein synthesis remained
