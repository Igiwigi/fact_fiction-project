Molecules which are Rigid Elastic Spheres which Exert Attractive Forces.

ยง 9 (E) Experiments on the phenomena of actual gases, as, for example, on the
variation of viscosity with temperature, indicate that none of the molecular models
so far discussed in this chapter gives a really adequate representation of these
phenomena. The best of all the simple models which have been used in the kinetic
theory seems to be that considered by VAN DER WAALS and SUTHERLAND, viz., a
rigid elastic sphere surrounded by a weak field of attractive force. This agrees with
the known fact of slight cohesion in gases. The effect of this field of force on the velocity-
distribution function, or on viscosity and thermal conductivity, may be referred
mainly to the deflections of molecular paths for which it is responsible indirectly,
through the collisions which it induces between molecules which would otherwise
pass one another without mutual inter-action, rather than to its direct effect in the
absence of collisions. The latter effect will be expressly neglected in our calculations,
which will therefore be inapplicable to vapours in which the cohesion is large enough
to render this neglect invalid.
