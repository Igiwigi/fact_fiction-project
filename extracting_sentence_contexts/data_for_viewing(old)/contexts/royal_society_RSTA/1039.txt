obey linear propagation laws); and the comparison with experiments is good only for a restricted
range of deformation.

In any case, the seed was sowed. The highly successful Ogden strain-energy density function
[9] came later and although it seemed to start from a completely different perspective, it was


clearly grounded in Rivlin’s work. Rivlin’s theory expresses the strain energy function of an
isotropic solid in terms of the first three principal invariants of strain, whereas Ogden uses a
different set of invariants. The difference in choosing Rivlin’s set of invariants as opposed to
another set caused a lot of debate but an artificial controversy, because in a finite-dimensional
space, any set of invariants is related to any other by a bijective map; the only difference generated
is akin to a numerical pre-conditioning of the data (in fact, Rivlin was so concerned with this
contrast that the last two papers he ever wrote in his late eighties were about the comparison
between the Valanis—Landel approach and his own approach [10,11]). The Ogden model was the
concrete realization of the power and potential of the general theory of large deformation isotropic
elasticity developed by Rivlin because it finally became possible to fit accurately theoretical
stress-strain curves to experimental data for a variety of deformations and a large range of strains.

Today we know much more about this general theory: we have a clear idea about the numerical
turning points in the fitting of the phenomenology theory with experimental data [12]; we know
that the theory is really robust and the actual functional forms do not really matter [7]; we know

how to relate the phenomenological point of view to the mesoscopic description of polymeric : =
networks [3]; and so on. : =
