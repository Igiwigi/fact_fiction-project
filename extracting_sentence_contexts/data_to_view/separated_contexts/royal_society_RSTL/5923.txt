the afternoon the calculated is about thirty minutes earlier than the observed point. These differences are, however, satisfactorily explained by the fact, that, in the situation
at which the observations were made, the horizon towards north, west, and east is not
free, owing to the hills of the Neckar Valley which rise 12 above the horizon, in con-

Horizon during a given time. As has been already shown, the formula
