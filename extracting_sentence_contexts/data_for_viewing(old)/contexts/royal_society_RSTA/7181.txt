From the observed relations between friction and detonation, it can be concluded that

(i) No appreciable sensitiveness is observed except towards the bottom right-hand of
table 45, i.e. for grit of hardness about 4 and over, and for surfaces of mild steel. Mercury
fulminate is not sensitized by grit.

(ii) The fact that even hard grit such as carborundum has no marked effect on the
initiators, under the conditions of the test, until hard surfaces are likewise present, supports
the previous conclusion that grit acts on hard surfaces by forming hot spots of a sufficiently
high temperature to activate grains of initiator in the neighbourhood (cf. part III (1)).

(iii) The fact that lead azide is markedly more grit sensitive than fulminate appears to
be due to its superior ‘pick up’ from the decomposition of individual grains, in building up
detonation.

Evidence on this property is given below (cf. part II (2)). It is of importance in applications
of initiators.

(iv) The partial quenching of hot spots by a surface layer of tin 0-001in. thick is of
interest. If the order of magnitude of the heated regions were many powers of 10 less than
0-001 in., complete quenching would be expected.
