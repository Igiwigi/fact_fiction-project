must reduce to two only. This will be the ordinary case, and we see that if the
forms of F, F,, have been found by any means, the solution is completed without
integration ; the process corresponds to CHArprt’s method of deducing all complete
primitives from one, but it differs in that the functions F,, Fj, are not arbitrary ;
they must, in fact, be so chosen that the four equations last written shall reduce to
two, and the conditions for this are clearly very complicated in general, though in
particular cases available forms for F,, F, may be seen on inspection. In the more uncommon case, when there are three equations
i=, HS =:0;, na =—.0;

the six equations

must reduce to one only. These two cases are further discussed, from a somewhat different point of view,
in §§ 21—23.
