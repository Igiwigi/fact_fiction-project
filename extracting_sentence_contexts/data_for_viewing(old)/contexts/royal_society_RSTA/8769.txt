seale does not exceed 10/6°25 or 1°6. Comparison with the remainder of the table
shows therefore that its absence is to be expected if the drop of intensity from I. to
IT. is not of a different order from that found in any other series. The disappearance
of the same line from IV. and later photograplis is also to be expected, unless a great
increase of its relative intensity takes place suddenly at this point.

In the case of Parhelium, the Sharp and Principal series decrease in intensity as
compared with the Diffuse series, without the temporary reversal of this phenomenon,
at the end of the dark space, found in the case of Helium. The apparent reversal at
a considerable distance, found in the case of Helium on one plate of the Principal
series and stated not to be decisive, is repeated on two plates in the Principal series
of Parhelium (VIL, VII.) and now appears to be real. Very considerable exposures,
however, would be necessary at greater distances in order to establish the fact that
the phenomenon continued to occur. We have preferred, in the experiments recorded
in this communication, to confine attention to a series of photographs taken with
identical duration of exposure.

It is difficult to draw any conclusions, in the case of Parhelium, with regard to the
relative transfer of energy between the Sharp and Principal series, for the former is
only visible on two photographs. The only definite difference of behaviour with
regard to Helium and Parhelium thus appears to lie in the region at the end of the
dark space, where there is a temporary relative diminution of the Diffuse series of
Helium, but not of Parhelium.
