It will be seen that the conditions became more and more favourable for increasing
size up to Group 3 and then dropped again. Within the limits of each group,
however, the fluctuation due to changing environment is comparatively slight and, as
the result will show, has no seriously disturbing effect.

The absolute dimensions obtained in this way have, of course, a somewhat artificial
value, but the relative values remain little altered. Any clone or line which tends to
produce young above the average size of young produced by other clones or lines
under the same conditions will be above the average for the group in which it is
found, and after correction in the way deseribed will be proportionately above the
mean for the whole generation.

[Added July 21.—This process is in fact the same in principle as that adopted when
dealing with the inheritance of stature in man. The mean height of females bears to
that of males about the proportion 100 : 108, and the heights of all females were there-
fore multiplied by Garon by 108 and then treated as male measurements. In the
present case we find'that the conditions prevailing for Group 1 were such as to make
the mean size of the young bear to the mean size of the standard group the proportion
48°735 : 49°167, and therefore the sizes of all the individuals in Group 1 are multiplied
by 1:0089 and they are then treated as having been born under the same conditions
as the standard group.
