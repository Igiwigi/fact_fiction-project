These changes, 80 common in protoplasmic matter, wherever met with, give rise to the
suggestion that they may be due to the separation of two immiscible fluids, by the con-
tact of a third, from a previous state of feeble combination. The lilac or faint blue tint,
of the vacuoles may be an optical effect of contrast, as I produced a similar appearance
by shaking together water and yellow fat, but, as the depth of the lilac tint is not
in the ratio of the depth of the yellow, I am not certain on this point. That I am justi-
fied in calling them droplets, is shown by the fact that they sometimes fuse together. QThe granular basis, which, besides the yellow droplets in a granular condition, forms
Re formative yelk, is exhibited best by the action of water, which, while it causes the
ISter to disappear gradually while vacuolating, makes the former at once become darker
#nd more distinct, and does not cause its ultimate disappearance.

=The homogeneous matrix of the cortical layer contains also a peculiar form of albumen,
Thich water precipitates in fine molecules, and which I shall have to speak of as albu-
men 6. »

'SThe yellow droplets disappear also with vacuolation in a solution of sal-ammoniac,
ﬆhough less rapidly than in water. A weak solution of acetic acid acts on them some-
E- 8imilarly.
