electricity. Now where the vertical current spreads out horizontally the stream
lines of the air have horizontal components. For the present purpose it does not
matter whether we consider that the vertical current spreads out uniformly on all
sides or is deflected in a certain direction. In either case the water accumulated at
the head of the current will be gradually moved horizontally until it reaches the
edge of the rapid vertical current, and there it will be able to escape by falling ; but i
as it will necessarily take some time for any given mass of water to travel from the
centre to the outside of the ascending current, there will be time for considerable
breaking up before the drops actually fall. Thus the water carried up by the
ascending current will fall as positively charged heavy rain over one or other of the
edges of the ascending current. This is of course considering the case in its simplest
terms. As a matter of fact, the ascending current will vary in velocity, will have
its gusts and lulls just as a horizontal wind has. Such variations, however, will be
of great help in causing splashing, for Lenarp* found that “the sudden contact of
already deformed drops with a quicker air stream is very favourable to the breaking
of the drops.” Another consequence of the gusts and lulls in the ascending currents
will be the raising and lowering of the region in which the water is held in
suspension, and with this will follow rapid changes in the electrical field which may
possibly help to produce electrical discharges.

The water which has become positively charged on the ascending current and then
fallen as rain will be the heavy rain which occurs in the centre of the thunderstorm :
the ‘ Platzvegen” of the German authors. In view of this consideration, it will be
interesting to look at the results of actual measurements of rain electricity, to see if
