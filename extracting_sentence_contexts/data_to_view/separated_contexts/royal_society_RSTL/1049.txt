SECTION I. What are the Evidences of Impregnation ? The investigation of every complicated subject of inquiry
comprehends within its range a more or less extended recital
of facts, depending in a, greater or less degree on each other,

perstructure is raised, or the trunk from which the various
ramifications of inquiry proceed, it is essential, to the establish-
ment of the ultimate conclusions, that the antecedent question

be rightly decided. It becomes then indisputably necessary to

impregnation. That a female is impregnated when a foetus is sensibly
formed, is 80 obvious to reason that no argument can be neces-
sary to convince us of its truth.
