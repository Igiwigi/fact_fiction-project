Tarsioidea

Lemuroidea

It is no part of my task in this lecture to attempt to correlate the developmental
with the morphological and other evidence bearing on the large and complex question
of the phylogeny of the Primates. I am well aware, however, that certain morpho-
logical facts do not, at the moment, appear to fit in with the phylogenetic scheme here
envisaged, cf. for example, the striking observations of my colleague, THoRNTON CARTER
('22) on the structure of the enamel in the Primates which, taken at their face value,
seem to support the conception of the diphyletic origin of the Old and New World
Monkeys rather than the monophyletic view I have been led to adopt. The significance
of these and other like facts must remain over for future determination and discussion,*
but meantime I venture to claim that the views herein put forward on developmental
grounds are by no means lacking in support from the morphological side. I content
myself with calling attention to the conclusions of my colleague, Exnior Surru, as
expressed in his writings} and graphically in the phylogenetic scheme constructed by

CarreEr’s results have already formed the basis of a discussion on the classification of the Primates, by these
authorities.
