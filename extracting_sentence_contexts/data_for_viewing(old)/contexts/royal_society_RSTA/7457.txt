DISINTEGRATION OF LIQUID SHEETS 129

When a placid sheet is disturbed by waves, threads are torn from numerous points in
the wave crests and holes may be blown in the sheet between the waves (figure 21c,
plate 12, 78%, glycerine/water at 630 cm/s).

Where the velocity of the sheet is high and the wave amplitude is sufficiently great,
particles are formed and torn off from the inner edges of the holes and the wave crests
are curled back (figure 21a, plate 12, 50% glycerine/water at 2440 cm/s). The holes
formed in this manner are, in fact, characterized by drops being formed around their
periphery. On the other hand, holes produced by perforation of the sheet, as already
described, have drops formed at their periphery only when the life of the holes is pro-
longed, i.e. mercury and liquids in vacuo.

With liquids having visco-elastic properties, where the viscosity is reduced with increase
of rate of shear, the sheet is similarly disintegrated through the formation of waves. By
reason of the rapid reduction of inertia forces, however, the viscosity increases rapidly and
inhibits a further break-up of the thread into drops. A gossamer-like spray is formed
consisting of a web of fine threads. This is shown in figure 29a, plate 16.

spread out from a central orifice to the edge by the formation of a vortex ring (as in
