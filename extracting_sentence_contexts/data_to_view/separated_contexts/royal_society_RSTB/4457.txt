The fact that there is a temporary sharp rise of the respiratory quotient to 1-0
or beyond, «e., that the CO, output is for a brief time actually in excess of the
oxygen absorption, immediately after the stop of the exercise has been noticed by
other observers (Lonwy, Karzenstery, Zuntz and Hagemann, Zunrz and Scuum-
Buna ; loc. cit.). These authors have suggested that the cause of this is to be found in
the fact that in addition to COQ, other substances derived from the active muscles
(e.g., lactic acid) stimulate the respiratory centre, and that on cessation of the work
the breathing remains exaggerated until these substances can be oxidised, the
exaggeration of the breathing implying, of course, washing out of CO, from the body
in excess of the oxygen absorbed. This theory alone seems to us quite insufficient to explain the facts. The sharp
rise of the respiratory quotient is shown in our experiments no matter whether the
