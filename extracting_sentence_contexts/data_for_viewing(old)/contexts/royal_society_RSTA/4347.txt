in table 1, one of them has been proposed for a spectroscopic determination of kg [50].

If the Oz-based implementation is still at the stage of a proposal, there has been already

a test experiment on acetylene at 788nm with a gas pressure ranging from 0.5 to 3Pa (in : &
which the A-ratio is larger than 1000). This experiment yielded spectroscopic measurements of Dos
the gas temperature, with the cell operating at room temperature, with a global uncertainty : =
of two parts over 10° [51]. For either O2 at 687nm or CoH» at 788nm, owing to the very : yy
small line intensity factors, the use of frequency-stabilized cavity ring-down spectroscopy is (3
necessary. This technique has to be preferred to other cavity-enhanced approaches because it aes
provides a direct (and absolute) measurement of the absorption coefficient, namely the product 22
SNg(v — vo) [52]. It is worth noting that the use of an optical cavity requires a particular : 8
care. In fact, the enhancement of the absorption path-length is usually accompanied by an : S
enhancement of the optical power inside the cavity [53]; depending on the incident power [2
and mode matching parameter, the intensity can reach extraordinarily high values in the beam if

waist (easily larger than 10°Wm~? for 1mW of incident power), thus leading to nonlinear
effects, on the one hand, and local heating of the absorbing gas, on the other hand. This latter
phenomenon, in particular, may lead to a measurable positive shift in the retrieval of the Doppler
width.

4. The carbon dioxide experiment

Figure 1 also indicates that the use of CO2 at 24m wavelength (whose lines belong to the
v1 + 2v2 + v3 combination band) may be advantageous, the A-ratios being larger than those of
