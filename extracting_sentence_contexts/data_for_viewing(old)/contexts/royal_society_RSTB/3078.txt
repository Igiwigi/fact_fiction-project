Brarp’s theory is adopted by Sanpes (1903), who has studied the corpus luteum in
the marsupial Cat (Dasyurus viverrinus). SANDES states that in Dasyurus, as in
other mammals, the corpus luteum disappears towards the end of lactation and with
the approach of the next cestrous period, when the follicles begin to grow in
preparation for the ensuing ovulation. He shows further, that as soon as the corpus
luteum is formed, the ova in the surrounding follicles, which were up to that time in
various stages of active development, begin to atrophy. This atrophy commences in
the follicles in closest proximity to the newly-formed corpus luteum and is continued in
the other follicles in ever widening circles. SaNnpEs suggests that the process is
brought about by mechanical pressure or is due to the internal secretion of the corpus
luteum, if it has one.

Without in any way disputing the accuracy of the facts which Sanpxs describes,
we find it difficult to understand what advantage is gained by a mechanism having a
no more important object than that of securing the degeneration of the surplus ova

* Brarp says, “T hold [that ovulation ensues soon after parturition] in all mammals.”

within the ovary instead of externally to it, nor do we see how, according to the
usually accepted doctrines of utility and natural selection, an organ having such a
function could ever have been developed at all.
