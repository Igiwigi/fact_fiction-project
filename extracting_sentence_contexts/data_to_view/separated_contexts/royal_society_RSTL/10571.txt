If the bubble were originally on the borders of
instability a 8mall change in 'T would produce a finite change in the position of the
liquid in the manometer, and thus the sensitiveness would be infinite. In the case of
the apparatus used by PLATEAU the whole phenomenon must have occurred within
narrow limits and would easily escape attention. 'The following table explains itself, and illustrates the fact that as the sagitta
increases V+v has 8uccessively a maximum and a minimum value. 4M2
