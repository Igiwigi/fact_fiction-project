by the $arcolemma, which has been already shown to be the more extensi√æle structure :
this stretches them, and when at length they give way, they are much attenuated,
fall together over those in the centre, and come to a rude point. From the same
cause the extremity of a broken fasciculus sometimes may present an appearance of
a tube. What much corroborates this explanation is, that in s8nch cases the terminal
striz are always much widened and distorted.

If the fasciculi be placed in water, some of this fluid is absorbed by them, and they
undergo an increase in bulk. 'This may explain why s0 many authors have differed
from the accurate LEEUWENHOEK and PROCHASKA, and asserted them to be of a cylindri-
cal form, for when thus swollen they lose much of that angular shape, which is s0
convenient and necessary for close package in the natural condition. I allude to this
fact, however, for the purpose of introducing a description of one of the most instruc-
tive phenomena connected with this investigation. It regards muscle, not in a passive,
but an active state; and besides exhibiting the condition of the fibrillee during con-
traction, which for the present I omit noticing, furnishes a further proof of those
qualities and relations of the sarcolemma that have been ascribed to it above. It
occurs in fasciculi just taken from the animal, either till living or a moment dead,
