At last, on
Hilbert’s birthday, a freshly printed set of Hilbert’s collected papers was presented to the
Geheimrat. Hilbert leafed through them carefully and did not note anything.’ According
to Reid [20], Hilbert was aware of the changes but was not concerned. It is a fact of life that mathematicians do make mistakes. Another fact of life is that the majority of
them are of a trivial nature and can be corrected ‘without major changes to the statements’. There
are bad mistakes, related to haste, or complete lack of vision, where nothing can be salvaged.
