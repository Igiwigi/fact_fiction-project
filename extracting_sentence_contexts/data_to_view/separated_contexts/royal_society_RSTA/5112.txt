We shall assume the
universal pattern of supersymmetry breaking throughout this article. So far, no direct evidence for supersymmetric particle production at the LHC has been found
(in other words, not enough collisions have been seen which predict high amounts of missing
transverse momentum). In order to display this fact, experiments interpret their data in terms of
exclusion bounds on supersymmetric models. For example, in figure 5, we see exclusion bounds
on the universal model described above. As can be seen from the figure, there are many ways of
sieving the data and looking for supersymmetric particles, with much associated activity by the
experimental collaborations in doing so.
