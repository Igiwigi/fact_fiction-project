WILSON ON THE CONDENSATION NUCLEI PRODUCED IN

intensity ; the number of drops produced on expansion, indicating as it does the
number of carriers which at that instant are on their way across between the plates,
will therefore be inversely proportional to the difference of potential. The phenomenon
is, in fact, closely related to the fact first noticed by Sroterow,* that the currents
produced by the action of ultra-violet light on negatively electrified surfaces approach
a saturation value as the electromotive force is increased. The fact that the source of the rays is discontinuous must also not be forgotten,
for with strong fields all the ions produced by the action of one spark may have time
to travel across to the other plate, under the influence of the electric field, before the
next spark takes place. The fact that the carriers in hydrogen, as RurHERFoRDt has shown, travel
several times as fast as in air, explains why the phenomenon under consideration was
only observed in the former gas. With greater differences of potential, or a smaller
distance between the plates, it would no doubt be observed in air also.
