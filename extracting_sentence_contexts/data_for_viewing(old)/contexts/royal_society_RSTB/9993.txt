child labour fuelled the engine of industrialization in Britain,
allowing for a much faster pace of economic growth than
would have otherwise been possible. Most tellingly, her
analysis suggests that it was institutional factors, such as edu-
cational reform and child labour laws (many of which were
prompted and promoted by former child labourers), that
changed employment dynamics, and led to children becom-
ing less productive. At least in the British case, then,
complex social and cultural changes play a crucial role in
explaining how and why people made the shift from large
to small families, and this cannot be explained by economic
decision-making at the individual level alone. This suggests
that we cannot ignore the contingent facts of history when
attempting to develop models of fertility decline, although
this historical component is not incorporated into current
economic and behavioural ecological models. That is, insti-
tutional factors and historical processes are often taken as
given by such models (perhaps envisioned as constraints;
see also [52]), allowing individual reproductive decision-
making to be predicted within a specific context. As
institutional context represents a parameter of these models,
it cannot, by definition, be used to predict the emergence of
the institutions themselves (such as child labour laws, ideas
of contraceptive use). As these institutional factors are clearly
