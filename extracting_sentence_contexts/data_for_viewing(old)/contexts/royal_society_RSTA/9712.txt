distances which are not too great. It will also be noticed that T(z, §) does not
vary as rapidly with the wave-length as T(0,¢). The nature of the scattered
radiation from a portion of the sky near the horizon is governed principally
by the term Se-°**’, Ze. it is of nearly the same quality as the direct sunlight
except for the contribution to the intensity due to the second term in T (3x, ¢)
which represents the effect of self-illumination. This feature is not shown by

expressions for sky radiation hitherto obtained; in fact the whitish colour of the
sky near the horizon was considered by Ketyrn* to be an objection-to the theory of
scattering,

By calculating the values of the intensities of solar radiation which reaches the
earth’s surface for various zenith distances of the sun and for various wave-lengths,
and by integrating the curves so obtained, we obtain the values of the total intensity
of solar radiation reaching the two stations Mount Wilson and Washington. Taking
the value of the solar constant to be 1°922 calories per square centimetre per
minute,t the results are given in the same units and are calculated for solar
radiation incident on a plane normal to the sun’s rays as well as for the solar radiation
incident on a horizontal plane. The results are given in Tables VII. and IX., and
are shown graphically in Diagrams IX. and X.
