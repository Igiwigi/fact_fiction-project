In this neighbourhood are a number of spores, one of which is seen in this figure
and more in fig. 78. The spores are round or oval and range in size from 12-5p
to 40u. It might be questioned whether these spores really belong to the specimen,
since the associated-tube tissue is broken down in this region. But another spore is
shown in fig. 79 from a more central position and its relation to the tissue is certain,
its wall is cracked but the outline is distinct. At another place, embedded among
the crowded fine tubes that may indicate nearness to the surface was a spore, the
wall of which was brownish-yellow, translucent, and seemed to have a tri-radiate-
marking (fig. 80).

The fourth specimen, a piece of thin, black, wrinkled incrustation shown of natural
size in fig. 81, Plate 12, may be dealt with briefly. Its chief interest lies in its size
and isolation and in the fact that it gives some little idea of the form of a piece of
Nematothallus. It is over 6ยง cm. long by 1 cm. broad. Film-pulls and transfers of
the counterpart revealed a close tissue of fine tubes making up most of the
incrustation with, at places, indications of the cuticular pattern. At one spot,

well within the limits of the specimen, wide tubes were found along with the narrow
ones (fig. 82, Plate 12). There were also indications of spores; but all details
beyond the associated-tube structure were difficult to observe owing to the
poor preservation. Along with this piece may be mentioned a number of slightly
larger, isolated brown incrustations from the same locality (Freshwater East), for
