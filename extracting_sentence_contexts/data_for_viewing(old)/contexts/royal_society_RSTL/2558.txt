their heat in a different manner. My tents were within 200 yards of the fields where
I observyed these phenomena ; but from the 11th to the 30th of January there was not
any deposition of dew abont them, excepting on the 13th of January only, and the
dewing-point was but once within 45 of the point of saturation. In consequence of
these observations I was induced to remark particularly the localities of dew at Poona
and in its neighbourhood. In September and October I found that when there was
not a trace of dew in the cantomnent, there would be a deposition on the fields of
Standing grain half a mile distant ; and when there was not any dew either in the
cantonment or in the fields, it would yet be found on the banks of running rivulets,
and on the banks of the Mota Mola river : but with respect to the riyulets, fifteen or
twenty feet from the water were the limits of the deposition.

The local character of dew is further attested by the following facts. On the night

neighbourhood. Before daylight I rode thirty-four miles west-north-west to Karleh,
inthe hilly tracts, and to my surprise found my baggage, which had been left exposed
during the night, dripping wet with a copious deposition. On the 1st of March I
reached Bombay at sunrise, and observed all the tents pitched on the esplanade satu-
rated with dew; and they were nightly in this state during the period of my stay in
Bombay up to the 10th of March. On the 11th, at sunrise, on my return to Poona,
I was at Kundallah, at the top of the Bore Ghat, thirty-one miles inland from the
