to be proved, but so far as the retina is concerned a justifiable conclusion appears to be
that cluster formation ought to take place because the rod and cone populations are both
large; roughly thirty million cones, and about three times that number of rods. At the
centre of the fovea there is stated to be a small rod-free area, elsewhere the two populations
are mixed, the rods predominating more and more as the periphery is reached.

The position, so far as the fovea is concerned may, perhaps, be summarized as follows:
it seems likely that conditions there are such that cluster formation may occur. As ex-
plained elsewhere, this provides an adequate basis for the high acuity of the human eye for
lights of different colour. It also helps to account for the retinal direction effect of Stiles
& Crawford (see ยง 123). A warning must be given, however, that factors of an unknown
kind may be present which may either facilitate, or inhibit, the process of cluster formation.
What is wanted is independent evidence that such clusters do in fact exist in the retina.
Suppose such evidence to be forthcoming, then a further question would arise, namely,
why is it that these clusters do not disclose their presence in normal vision? This point will
be considered in Part XII.

(119) Some experimental evidence for cluster formation

Before experiments were started, in order to search for evidence of cluster formation, it
was anticipated that there would be difficulties in the way owing to the action of the
process of repair which will be described in Part XII. This anticipation proved to be fully
justified for a number of experiments, several gave no result. A single bright flash of light
sometimes gives an appearance of a fine mosaic of coloured points. The application of
pressure to the front of the eyeballs sometimes produces a somewhat similar effect. Occa-
