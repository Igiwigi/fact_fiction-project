It does not determine an upper limit to the speed
of flow which must be stable because some other type of disturbance might exist which
would increase initially at a lower speed of the fluid. Neither does it determine a lower
limit to the speeds at which the flow must be unstable, because the assumed disturbance
which initially increases might decrease indefinitely at some later stage of the motion. It has been shown in fact that certain types of initial disturbance exist for which this
actually is the case. *

The method of OssornE ReyNo.ps has been modified by Orr, who has determined
in two cases} the highest speed of flow at which all small disturbances initially decrease. At this speed evidently any initial small disturbance will decrease indefinitely.
