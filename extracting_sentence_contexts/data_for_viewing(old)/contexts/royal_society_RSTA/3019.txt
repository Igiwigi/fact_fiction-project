where we used the fact that the coarse-graining By := ) icy Bj is trace-preserving (true also
for Ax). One can now consider X = {0,1} with Tr[Ao(e)] =0. Then, for example, the causality
principle would be falsified if, upon changing test B to a different test Bâ€™, one would have the
occurrence of the outcome 0 for test A.

(f) From Cinderella to principle of physics

The causality principle that here we have derived as a theorem of quantum theory, in [13,14]
has been used instead as the first of six information-theoretical postulates to derive quantum
theory in finite dimensions (a didactical derivation can be found in the textbook [15]). Recognizing
causality as a postulate for the theory has allowed us for the first time to consider variations of the
theory that do not satisfy it. This has spawned a full research line about non-causal variations of
quantum theory, ranging from the theory of quantum combs [21] (which still has an interpretation
