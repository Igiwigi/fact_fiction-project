Newton’s Principia
evidenced problems and techniques, had a decisive impact on the development of the scientific
thought and opened a path along which rational mechanics developed systematically. Newton’s
viewpoint indicated new territories both in the norms adopted to explain concepts and in the
mathematical techniques, but already the ancient Greeks had the perception of the vastness of the
subject. In fact, the oldest text on mechanics that we know of is in Greek: Mechanical Questions. Historians still debate whether we have to attribute it to Aristotle (384-322 BC), Archytas of
Tarentum (428-347 BC), or even and more generically we can affirm it has been written by some
fellow of the Lyceum in Athens to interpret some phenomena in the terms of Aristotelian natural
philosophy [4]. The list of topics discussed in Mechanical Questions includes cases that can be
analysed by considering the scheme of rigid bodies and also cases where strain plays a prevalent
role, as in the discussion of vorticity in fluids there included.
