pound decomposition, may sometimes cause a real difference
in the comparative magnitude of the attractive forces. Those
numbers, to which no asterisc is affixed, are merely inserted
by interpolation, and they can only be s0 far employed for de-
termining the mutual actions of the salts to which they belong,

as the results which they indicate would follow from the com-
parison of any other numbers, intermediate to the nearest of
those, which are more correctly determined. I have not been
able to obtain a sufficient number of facts relating to the me-

- tallic salts, to enable me to comprehend many of them in the

tables.

It has been usual to distinguish the attractions, which pro-
duce the double decompositions of salts, into necessary and
superfluous attractions ; but the distinction is neither very ac-
curate, nor very important: they might be still further divided,
accordingly as two, three, or the whole of the four ingre-
dients concerned are capable of simply decomposing the salt
in which they are not contained ; and if two, accordingly as
