(d) Worker-like Forms.—In four worker-like forms which were dissected the fat-
body was extensively developed, resembling the condition found in the winged forms.

5. The Nervous System and Corpora Allata.

(a) The Soldier. —The nervous system consists of the supra- and infra-cesophageal
ganglia, together with a ventral nerve cord, consisting of three thoracic and six
abdominal ganglia. A visceral or sympathetic system is also well developed.

The supra-asophayeal ganglion (fig. 43) is situated in the extreme anterior region
of the head and measures 1°12 mm. transversely* and 0°6 mm. antero-posteriorly.
The protocerebron is extremely well developed, which is remarkable considering the
fact that the eyes are imperfect organs. The protocerebral lobes form the largest
part of the brain and give off the optic nerves. The latter present an unusual feature

* Tn all cases the transverse measurement is the distance between the roots of the two optic nerves.
The antero-posterior measurement is taken from the root of the antennary nerve to the hind margin of
the optic lobe of the same side.
