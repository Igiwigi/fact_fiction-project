shews, that the most refrangible or least flexible rays were
farthest moved from their course by the unusual action, and
proves this to be very different from flexion.*

From all these observations this conclusion follows; that
the remarkable phaznomenon in question arises from an action
very different from either refraction or flexion; and whose na-
ture well deserves to be farther considered. It may possibly

these bodies wants the property: for we cannot mould theparticles

the-same form with the largest: but then other hypotheses
may perhaps also account for the fact, such as atmospheres,
