In such cases the
food supplied to the heart is of diminished nutritive value, while the work which the
organ has to perform is not reduced to a corresponding extent, but is, indeed, very
frequently increased. That the heart in these conditions may easily become so
dilated that functional regurgitation through the mitral and tricuspid orifices manifests
itself is only what one would expect. Seeing that increase in the output of the heart
will not of itself put the left ventricle to a greater disadvantage than the right
ventricle, the fact that the mitral valve often gives way before the tricuspid, would
seem to indicate that, in chlorosis, the pressure of the blood within the systemic arteries
is frequently higher than normal,

The readiness with which the heart is quickened on slight exertions and emotions
in the case of chlorotic patients, shows how readily the augmentors are called into
play in that condition, and if, as may be assumed, the pressure in the systemic vessels
is at the same time raised by constriction of the vessels of certain vascular areas, we
can readily understand that more work will be thrown on the left heart than upon
the right. It must not be forgotten, however, that mitral regurgitation, due to
malnutrition of the heart, differs from that caused by organic valve disease, in so far as
in the former the right heart has also been badly fed as well as the left, so that we
would expect tricuspid regurgitation to follow much more closely upon the mitral
insufficiency of chlorosis than upon the regurgitation of organic mitral disease. The enormous increase in the work done by the heart which results from the
injection of a comparatively small amount of normal salt solution, shows how important

it must be to reduce to the lowest possible limit the water of the food and drink of
patients suffering from weak or diseased hearts.
