various species will be marked by increasing simplicity of spectrum.
Group IV.—Simplest line absorption predominant. :
Group V.—Line absorption predominant, with decreasing temperature. The

various species will be marked by decreasing complexity of spectrum. b
Grove VI.—Carbon absorption predominant.
Grove VII.—Extinction of luminosity.

The fundamental difference between this and other classifications is that it demands _
the existence of bodies of increasing as well as bodies of decreasing temperatures.

We have, therefore, to inquire how far this condition is satisfied by the mass of
new facts at our disposal. This involves the consideration of some points in connec-
tion with the meteoritic hypothesis to which brief reference alone has been made in
my previous communications.

The Complex Origin of the Spectra of Nebula.

On the hypothesis, the bright lines seen in the nebule should have three origins.

(1.) The lines of those substances which occupy the greatest volume (or largest
area in a section); in other words, the lines of those substances which are
driven furthest out from the meteorites and occupy the interspaces, when
possibly they may be rendered luminous by electricity. Chief among these,
from laboratory experiments, we should expect hydrogen, and next, from the
