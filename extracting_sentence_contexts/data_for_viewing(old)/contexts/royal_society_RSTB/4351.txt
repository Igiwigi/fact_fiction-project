orbital bone is slight, so that it makes no approach to parallelism with the posterior
border of the orbit. It is also distinguished by its greater forward extension, for
it does not terminate till it reaches a point below the posterior margin of the external
nostril, while in J. communis it proceeds no farther than the anterior margin of the orbit.

The relative length and degree of curvature of the jugal differ considerably in
different species of Ichthyosaurus; in some, as for instance J. intermedius, the bone
is not so much curved as angulated. ;

In making a comparison with the jugal of Sphenodon it may first be pointed out
that Osawa has given an imperfect account of this bone owing to his having oyer-
looked the prolongation of its horizontal limb beneath the orbit. This curious
oversight is doubtless due to the fact that this prolongation cannot be seen on the _
face, where it is completely concealed by the maxilla, but is plainly visible on the
floor of the orbit, and is well defined by sutures. Howes and Swinnyerton have

figured it correctly. The anterior (unlike the posterior) moiety of the horizontal
limb is not compressed from side to side, but from above downwards, so that it forms
a rather curved lamella, which is united with the postorbital, transverse, palatine
and maxilla.

The most marked difference which distinguishes the jugal of Sphenodon is the
