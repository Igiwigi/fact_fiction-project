(4) When the discharge occurs between Qy and Qy, the inequality (6) is increased.
In this case, therefore, the negative potential gradient is increased.

We thus see that in three out of the four cases the negative potential gradient will
undergo a sudden increase during a lightning discharge. It is therefore not surprising
that in fig. 11, out of 18 lightning discharges, 15 caused a sudden increase in the negative
potential gradient. It is clear that the discharge between Q, and Qp, which causes
a diminution in the negative potential gradient, affects the charges in the part of the
cloud which is overhead at the time. Such a discharge will therefore generally cause
a more intense change in the field than the other types of discharges. We see, indeed,
from the record that the sudden changes 4, 5, 6 are generally more intense than the
rest. It is mterestmg to note the sequence of the sudden changes produced in this
record. The fact that a number of sudden changes more or less similar in character
and of the same sign occur in succession does apparently suggest a kind of persistency
in the manner in which lightning discharges occur. If a lightning discharge occurs
between one part of the cloud and another, the next few lightning discharges will occur
between the same two parts of the cloud, in a more or less similar manner.

I will now proceed to discuss the quick-run record obtained during the passage of the
thunderstorm of October 28, 1930. This record has been reproduced in fig. 13 (Plate 6).
From the times of beginning and ending of the quick-run record and also from the
broad changes in the potential gradient, we can easily identify this;record with the
portion marked LM in the electrogram of October 28, 1930 (fig. 7).

The thunderstorm is one of double type. The quick-run record comprises the changes
