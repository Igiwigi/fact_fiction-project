fact, when we consider the inaccuracies of balances, and the
effects produced by the different height of the column of water,
and by the changes of temperature to which the water is
exposed during the experiments, we have less reason to be
surprised at the frequent variations in the results ; and, in addi-
tion to these sources of error, if we consider the different
texture of bodies, and the numberless interstices of them, often
unequally arranged, and which cannot at all times be penetrated
by water, we may rather wonder that s0 much precision has
been attained. The last-mentioned obstacles to exactitude in
such experiments, are peculiarly to be observed, when the spe-
cific gravity of certain substances, such as stones and ores, is to
be determined ; and, although the metals, being in general more
dense, are supposed to be less liable to such variations in internal
texture, yet it is acknowledged, that the specific gravities of
these, as stated by various authors, cannot be regarded as exact;
and indeed, from the following experiments, I think it will

appear evident, that extreme precision and uniformity in the
results, can seldom be attained or expected. When metals are cast in a mould, they speedily become cold;
and, according to the quantity and quality of the meta], the
figure and position of the mould, and the greater or less rapidity
of the cooling, metals may vary in texture, and in the relative
proportion and arrangement of their interstices ; and conse-
quently the mass, in different parts, may be of unequal degrees
of density.
