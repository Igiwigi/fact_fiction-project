4a, b) about 41-45 cells could be counted, the deepest
cell being about 1066 Â» from the posterior pole of the egg. The cells have now
started to migrate towards the egg-periphery. The disposition of the division
spindles in these early stages do not show any definite orientation to the egg-periphery,
a fact which is in accord with what has been described in the majority of insects so
far studied. All the cleavage cells are stellate but none of them shows comet-like protoplasmic
extensions streaming behind the migrating cells ( cf. EAstHam, 1927 ; Seut, 1931 ;
and others).
