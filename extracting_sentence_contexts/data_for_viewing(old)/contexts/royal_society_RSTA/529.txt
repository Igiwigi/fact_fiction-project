Table 5 summarizes the most important processes in terms of radical production at low
temperatures in a hydrogen-air system in a post-discharge stage. The processes with the
participation of ‘hot’ atoms (corresponding rate constants are given with the index ‘h’),
competing processes of radical production involving particles with Maxwellian distribution
across translational degrees of freedom (‘eq’) and electronically excited (‘ex’) particles are also
shown. Recombination processes lead to the loss of ‘equilibrium’ atoms. Similarly, quenching
processes limit the effectiveness of electronically excited particles. Translational relaxation leads
to the losses of ‘hot’ atoms.

Chain branching reaction H + O2 =O + OH at T= 300K has the rate constant keq(300 K) =
2.5 x 10-7! (em? s~!), which is significantly lower than the rate of recombination of ‘cold’ atoms
(1.6 x 10-1? (cm3s~1) at p=1 atm). In fact, the rates of these processes become close to each
