In the Ostriches defecation and micturition are mostly separate acts, especially when
through a large development of the bursa Fabricii a physiological (dorsally situated)
bladder is produced.

The Chelonia (fig. 10, 11, 24, 25) represent a type somewhat intermediate between
that of the Ratitee and that of the Monotremata, at the same time bearing slight
resemblances to that of the Saurii. The rectum is separated from the cloaca by a
very distinct circular inner sphincter, re, fig. 25. The genital ducts and the ureters
open separately into a wide urino-genital sinus, which through a wide neck leads into
the large ventral urinary bladder ; on the other hand it stands in communication with
the cloaca by a large aperture. This aperture is surrounded by a partly transverse,
but chiefly longitudinal, horizontal fold, the right and left halves of which can by
approaching each other completely close the urino-genital sinus, and in fact do so firmly
in the living animal. The walls in the recessus recto-vesicalis project over the opening
of the sinus, as shown in figs. 10,11, 25, and 26. In the female they generally do not
extend far enough towards the tail to reach the root of the clitoris, because this organ
is, when very small like in Chelys, very far removed from the sinus. In the male,
however, the crura penis extend so far back towards the rectum that the end of the
dorsal groove of the organ can, with the help of the folds, receive the sperma. The
fold p, namely, is continued (Â¢f p. 1, fig. 11) into the loose sheath-like covering of
the penis, and gradually passes over from the margins of the longitudinal groove
towards the dorsum penis, and near the glans it goes over into the thin ventral walls
of the vestibular portion of the cloaca, as visible in fig. 10, near the insertion of the
M. retractor penis. A result of this somewhat complicated arrangement of this
eloacal-penial fold is that the copulatory organ in its proximal portion is situated
