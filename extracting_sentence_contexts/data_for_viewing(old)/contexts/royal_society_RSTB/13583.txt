hail from the same part of the world and have been in contact
with each other. This would suggest that whatever is going
on there, it is a single story shared by these three large
language families. The details of this story are fleshed out
later in this section. By contrast, the five language families
that exhibit the higher prevalence of obligatory TAM mark-
ing—Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic, Nuclear Trans New
Guinea, Pama-Nyungan and Otomanguean—all come from
different parts of the world; with the exception of Indo-Euro-
pean and Afro-Asiatic, they are not in contact with one
another. Thus, the higher prevalence of obligatory TAM
marking in these five large language families may be con-
sidered to represent four or five independent facts. All this
suggests that the examination of individual language families
needs to be conducted within an areal perspective.

Table 3 presents the distribution of obligatory and optional
TAM marking in accordance with a partitioning of the world
into eight areas, shown in the first column. The partitioning
is a modified version of the Glottolog 4.2.1 partitioning into
five areas, differing from it primarily by the introduction of
the Mekong-Mamberamo area, encompassing Mainland
Southeast Asia, the Indonesian archipelago, and the western-
most parts of New Guinea [42].'? Thus, of the areas in
