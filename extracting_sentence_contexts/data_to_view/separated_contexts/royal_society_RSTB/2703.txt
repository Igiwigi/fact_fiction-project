Fig. 4 (Plate 7) represents a section showing the nearest approach to a blood
lacuna that I have observed in a sheepâ€™s uterus during procestrum. The disappear-
anee of the epithelium at this point is, I think, in part due to faulty manipulation,
since it is unusual to find more than about half-a-dozen cells wanting at points where
small streams of blood corpuscles were being poured into the uterine cavity. The
mere fact, however, of the disappearance of the epithelium opposite a space that was
obviously a miniature lacuna, whether it had become denuded naturally or otherwise,
is evidence of a weakness at this point in the epithelial wall, due to the pressure
exerted from within by the extravasated blood. It is noticeable that in this section,
although the stroma presents a fairly normal appearance, capillaries are still wholly
absent, while a few extravasated corpuscles are seen scattered in the superficial
portion of the tissue. Formerly I was of opinion that denudation (if only to a slight extent) of epithelium
and bleeding into the uterine cavity occurred invariably during the sheep's procestrum.
