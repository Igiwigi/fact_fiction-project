1st day.—The animal paralyzed in both limbs. The left foot and leg are swollen, and the plantar
surface of the former is redder and drier than that of the opposite side. There is much less hair cover-

account for the fact that there is only a slight difference in the temperature of the popliteal spaces of the
two sides.

Sensation. (1). To heat.—The toes dipped in hot water were withdrawn almost immediately on the
right side, on the left there was a longer delay.
