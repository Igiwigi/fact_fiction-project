= movements after section of the pneumogastric nerves.

= It is the opinion of Lupwie (Lehrbuch der Physiologie des Menschen, Bd. ii. p. 168)
Hat the increased frequency of the contractions of the heart which follows ordinary
mspiration is in part owing to excitation of the pneumogastric neryes. This view he
Kpports on the ground that, although an increase of arterial tension corresponding
Hxactly to the increased expansion of the thorax is obseryed to accompany the expiratory
$ct in animals in which the vagus has been divided on each ide, this effect is not ass0-
Eiated with any acceleration of the pulse. I have already endeayoured to show that the
Ardinary respiratory variations of frequency of the heart's action admit of a more simple
explanation; it is, however, not the less necessary to investigate the facts in question,
which certainly at first sight seem to suggest such an inference as that drawn from them
by Lupw16.

It is well known that the immediate effect of section of the yagi in the neck is to
diminish the frequency of respiration, and to accelerate the contractions of the heart.
"There are, however, several points relating to these changes which must be referred to
here in their bearing on our present inquiry. 'The mode of respiration, after section, is

* From the extreme frequeney of the contractions of the heart the oscillations of the arterial lever are not

distinguishable in the engraving, although they are well defined in the original.
