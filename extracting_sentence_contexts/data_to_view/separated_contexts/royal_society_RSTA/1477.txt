The FWHM for ISM remains almost
independent of detector size up to a size of 1.355 AU, whereas for confocal it increases [68]. The optical sectioning effect is the same for a confocal microscope or for ISM with the same
size of pinhole/array. This can be seen from the fact that for a featureless object, there is no

spatial variation in the detector plane, so pixel reassignment does nothing. However, because the 8
signal from a point object is stronger in ISM, the detectability (signal to noise ratio of a point ina : 4
background volume [40]) is greater, about 1.6 times greater than for confocal [68].
