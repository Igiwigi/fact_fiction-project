This allows us to define
a generalization of the Gelfand spectrum to non-Abelian C*- and W*-algebras, which is just the
technical tool we need. We emphasize physical interpretation rather than mathematical details,
for which we provide sufficient references. No knowledge of topos theory is required, and, in fact,
topos theory plays no major role in this paper. There are various other sophisticated and highly developed approaches to non-commutative
geometry, see, for example, Connes and Marcolli from a differential geometric perspective [25,26];
Manin and Majid from deformation and quantum groups [27,28]; Kontsevich and Rosenberg
from algebraic geometry [29,30]; also Hrushovski & Zilber from geometric model theory [31]. Our approach differs from all these in various respects.
