Parent of origin effects could be related to differences in
expansion at male and female meiosis, whereas the immediate origins of the disease could be explained in
terms of healthy individuals carrying an expanded allele below the repeat length of ca. 38 that is now
recognized as critical in terms of clinical disease (Rubinsztein e/ al. 1996). Meanwhile, research on the nature and function of the protein produced by the gene inevitably proceeded
more slowly. This resulted in part from the lack of clues provided by gene sequence information, but it also
reflected the fact that the skills and techniques now needed for this work were very different from those
possessed by most of the genetic groups who had successfully found and isolated the gene itself. The
necessary restructuring of the groups took time, as did adjustment to the fact that the field was now open to
many experts who had previously had no involvement with HD. Again, it is a tribute to the loyalty that HD
