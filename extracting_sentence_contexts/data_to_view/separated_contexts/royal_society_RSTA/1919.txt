=. petrological examination of the most susceptible rocks, and the geological structure
£ was then considered in its bearing on the known facts. Tn the following pages, Mr. WatKkmr and Prof. Witson give separate accounts of
© their own parts in the investigation, and Dr. Cox has endeavoured, in Part III., with
3 the help of contributions from Mr. Water, to show how far the results may be
3 explained by the known geological structure. Contributions from Mr. WALKER or
