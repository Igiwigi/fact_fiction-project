V. The ribs start originally with capitula, which are at first continuous with, and
then form joints with the lateral processes of the basiventralia; when these
are reduced, the ribs retain only their tubercular attachment, which they
have gained by forming connections with dorsi-lateral outgrowths, or
diapophyses, of the neural arches.

VI. The basidorsalia do not carry separate supradorsalia, nor dorso-spinal elements.
The absence of such separate elements (and the same applies to the ventral
side) constitutes the only absolute difference between Amphibia and Fishes.

VII. The vertebrae do not possess, and cannot form, neuro-central sutures, because
their bodies are exquisitely arco-centrous, formed, in fact, by the arches
proper, namely, by the basidorsalia and basiventralia, while the interbasalia
produce the neutral, intervertebral mass. Hereby the Amphibia differ from
the Amniota. J, therefore, distinguish the Urodele vertebral bodies as Pseudo-
centra.* The terms Pre- and Postcentra, as used in Ama and in certain
Jurassic Ganoids, are not applicable to Amphibia.t

* Tho candal vertebre might be called Holocentrous, because their bodies, taking the central mass
from joint to joint, contain all the four pieces of arcualia fused together; or they might be called Meso-
centrous, with regard to the median position of the arches with the interarcual cartilage at either end.
But these terms would not express the leading differences between Urodela and the other Tetrapoda so
well as “ Pseudocentra,” especially if certain fossil Amphibia and Reptilia come into consideration.
