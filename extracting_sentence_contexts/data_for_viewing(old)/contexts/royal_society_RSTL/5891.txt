in the central and lateral sinuses of the latter are united to that of the trunk-sinus, but
they are not 80 united in Lingula; those of the lateral branches in it reach no further
than the margins of the trunk-sinus, a considerable space being left between their ter-
minations and the line in that sinus. This fact is conclusive against these lines being

according to Dr. Voer, for there is nothing else to be found in connexion with the
mantle that at all answers to his description, which is sufficiently accurate on this point.
'These vascular ramifications are, says this eminent anatomist, © 8urrounded by a trans-
lucent space, which is produced by a hollow canal in which the vessels lie.” This is
exactly the appearance the white lines assume in relation to the pallial sinuses when

outer branches of the 80-called vessels do not appear to join the trunk-vessel, but, SUP=
