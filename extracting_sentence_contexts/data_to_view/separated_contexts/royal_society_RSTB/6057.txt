In the first place the approximate constancy of fibrillar
inclination on tangential walls seems to suggest that there is in the protoplasm some
mechanism which can not only orientate the micelles laid down in a new wall,
but can continue to do so over long periods in an exactly similar manner. It must be pointed
out that this is only an inference and is not directly contained in the results. The
actual known fact is that the average inclination on tangential walls remains constant
from year to year ; the individual readings may be varying wildly in any file of
tracheids within the measured limits of variation, although this seems quite improb-
able. Since now the radial walls of an initial seem to have quite a different inclina-
tion from the tangential walls, the directing influence of an old wall must overrule
any orienting tendency in the protoplasm. We may conclude, therefore, for the
cases studied, that in the absence of any old wall the protoplasm can lay down

cellulose micelles in a definite direction over a considerable period, but that when an
old wall is present the direction of the micelles in a new layer conforms more closely to that in
the old wall than to that imposed on it by the protoplasm.
