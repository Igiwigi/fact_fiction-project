the result. The facts thus suggest the existence of two different strains of the
measles organism having somewhat different peculiarities in their life-histories. MEASLES EPIDEMICS IN LONDON BY THE METHOD OF THE PERIODOGRAM. 235

It is difficult to see how regular double periods can be explained on the hypothesis
