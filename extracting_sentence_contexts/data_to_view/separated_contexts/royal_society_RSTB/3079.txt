Male flowers of dicecious shrub seldom
seen with leaves, and always black as if burnt or blasted.‚Äù MavHrws describes it
as a small tree. It is a singular fact that the types of both genera were first
collected about 75 years ago. I should, perhaps, mention here that enlarged drawings, illustrative of the
structure of the flowers and fruits of the two genera, were exhibited at the Royal
Society's Conversazione on May 13, 1904, under the names of Amphipterygium
and Orthopterygium (Programme, p. 12). These names, as well as the term
Amphipterygiacee for the natural order, were taken up in various reports and
records, but I now, for reasons given above, think it better to return to Juliania,
and to call the order Julianiacez.
