But all attempts

* Namely, solution of the mass in dilute muriatic acid ; precipitation of the
lime, and addition of phosphate of ammonia to the filtered liquor.

+- As it did not enter into my plan, on this occasion, to turn my attention to the
estimation of proportions or precise quantities, I have not attempted to estimate
exactly the proportion which ammonia bears to the other ingredients of sea-water;

but as its presence can easily be shown in 100 grains of the bitter alts, its quantity
cannot be extremely minute,

to detect this salt in the bittern by crystallization were fruit-
less, though great pains were taken for that purpose; and I
feel the more confident that there is no sulphate of soda in
8ea-water, as the presence of this salt, in any but the most
minute quantities, would be quite incompatible with our know-
ledge of chemical affinities. For since there are, co-existing
in sea-water, muriate of soda and sulphate of magnesia, it is
evident that sulphate of soda would decompose muriate of
magnesia, which saltis known to be in sea-water. And again
we know, that sea-water contains sulphate of lime and muriate
of 8oda ; therefore it cannot contain sulphate of s8oda ; for in
that case we should have muriate of lime, which I have shown
to be contrary to fact. The last circumstance which I shall at present notice, re-
lates to the state in which potash exists in sea-water.* Potash
is found, by its appropriate re-agents, principally in the bittern ;
but it is found also among the salts which are separated from
it, especially in the Jatter period of crystallization. By farther
and repeated evaporation of the bittern, and successive separa-
tion of the mother water remaining after the removal of the
crystals formed, various distinct crystals were obtained pos-
sessing their characteristic form, namely, prismatic sulphate
of magnesia, cubic and star-shaped muriate of soda, and
rhombic crystals, quite different from either of the other salts,
These crystals, which were evidently portions of an oblique
rhombic prism, being carefully separated and washed with
water and alcohol, proved to be a triple salt of sulphate of

* It will be recollected, that the presence of potash in sea-water, though an-
nounced by myself in the paper on sea-water to which I have before alluded, was
