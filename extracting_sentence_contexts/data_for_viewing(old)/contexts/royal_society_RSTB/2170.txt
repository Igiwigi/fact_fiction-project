lime is stored in the vessel walls, and also in the connective tissue. This lime
store is applied (a) in winter by Helix for the formation of the epiphragm, by Arion
probably for strengthening its skin ; (b) by Helix for the repair of the shell, by Avion
for supplying the excretory mucus of the skin with lime salts.

Finally, Barrurtra concludes that the liver of Gastropods performs a variety ot
functions, which, in the higher animals, are asgigned to different organs.

In 1886 the fine paper of FrenzExt appeared (“ Mikrographie der Mitteldarmdriise
(Leber) der Mollusken ”), followed in 1893 by a second part, in which FRENZEL extends
his observations. In these papers he limits himself mostly to the “ glandular
epithelium,” which is figured in very elaborate coloured plates, but he confesses his
difficulties in obtaining sections of the gland itself. In fact the usual hardening
agents employed by FrRENzEL made the preparation so hard and brittle that he could
not cut useful sections of the gland.

While accepting Barrurrn’s conclusion that the “ferment cell” of that author
prepares a ferment, FRENzEL changed the name to “club cells,” or “ club-shaped
ferment cells” (Keulen-zellen, or keulenformige Ferment-zellen), and to the liver
cells of Barrurtu he gave the name of “ granular” cells (Kérnerzellen).

I think it is due to myself that I should here call attention to the way in which
FRENzEL has misrepresented a statement of mine. In my paper published in the
‘ Proceedings of the Royal Society’ in 1883, I said that in the liver of the snail there
