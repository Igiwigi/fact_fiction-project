Now

Ly, = Lyy = 1 — 3922 + 39924 — 1261 2° + 90028,

the largest of the set of discrete values of 4 for which L,) does not vanish is } = 1/5
and the terms of L,) are then respectively

39 , 399 1261 , 900

25 625 «15625 | 390625"

Even here the »* term predominates over the higher powers. THE DEFERRED APPROACH TO THE LIMIT. 325

The fact that L,, vanisheswhen 4 = + 1/(s — 1) and when 4 = + 1/(s —2) shows that it
is not possible to choose 4, independently of s, so that L,, may remain approximately
of the form 1 — X??, where X is independent of 4, as s > 0. Consequently, as far as
the polynomials L,, are concerned, it is not possible to fix h so as to make an h?-extrapolation
valid for every s. But for Lg, it will ome to make n, the number of steps in the range |
large relatively to(s —1)®?®. . 2... eae .(9)
