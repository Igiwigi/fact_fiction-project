The needle was charged to a potential of 80 volts, which was found to
be the voltage most suitable for the conditions of the experiment ; with this potential,
which did not however correspond to the most sensitive condition, the electrometer
afforded a deflection per volt of 420 mm. on a scale about 1 metre distant. As a
matter of fact, an exact determination of the sensitiveness of the electrometer was
not essential in the present investigation inasmuch as it is only the sign of the
charge that it is necessary to know in order to determine the points of discontinuous
curvature referred to in section 2. The leads from the upper electrodes to the electrometer quadrants were all screened
by brass tubing kept at zero potential. 4, Sources of Error.â€”A. Theoretical Assumptions.
