to prove the fundamental correctness of using equations like Navier-Stokes to describe the
physical behaviour of materials. Then in 2000, one hundred years after Hilbert, a group of
mathematicians examined the future of mathematics again. Many of Hilbert’s problems had in
fact been solved at least partially over the interim years. But Hilbert’s sixth remained a complete
enigma’ [2, p. 47]. The book of Rojstaczer is a novel and by definition a work of fiction and it incorrectly conflates
Hilbert’s sixth problem with the Clay Millenium problem for the Navier-Stokes equations.
