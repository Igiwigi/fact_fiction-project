So that the Hessian breaks up into the plane X=0 (axial or common biplane) and into

A cubic surface.

=) The complete intersection of the Hessian with the cubic swrface is made up of the
ine X=0, Y=0 (the axis) four times; and of a system of four conics, which is the

:Zpinode curye; C=8.

ie In fact combining the equations

WXZ—+(a, b, c, FX, YY=0

ZW(eX+dY)—3X(ac—HP, ad—be, bl—AFX,YY=0,

Shese intersect in the axis once, and in a curve of the eighth order which breaks up

Into four conics; for we can from the two equations deduce

[=

F= (a, b, 6, FX, YY(eX+dY)+8X(ac—Pb, ad—dbe, b4—&@YX, YY*=0,
