The vorticity is then the only vector field satisfying

lint = doe,


where a(-) =9(X,-) is the dual one-form of X using the Riemannian metric. In terms of the
vorticity, the equations read as in the Euclidean case:

and the Bernoulli function is defined using the Riemannian form, as well as the vector product.
Stationary solutions. We will be interested in equilibrium configurations, i.e. in stationary
solutions of these equations. A well-known fact is that the Bernoulli function is a first integral
for both X and w. In particular, the streamlines are confined into the level sets of B.
The stationary Euler equations with the Bernoulli formulation are

Xx @w=VB
div X=0.

In the analytic setting, Arnold noted the following fact about solutions to these equations. Let
(M,g) be an analytic Riemannian manifold and let X be an analytic solution of the equations.
If B is constant and X is non-vanishing, the vorticity is proportional to X everywhere, that is
curl X = fX for some analytic function f. In this case, X is called a Beltrami flow.

If B is not constant, its critical set Cr(B) := {p â‚¬ M| VB(p) =0} has a stratified structure and its
