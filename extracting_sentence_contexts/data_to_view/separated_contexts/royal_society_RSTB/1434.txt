Spinal Cord.—Passing now to the spinal cord, the action of aldoxime was shown to

depressant with a questionable initial stimulation. Aldehyde undoubtedly first
Simulates the cord, but such an action must be largely antagonized by nitrites, which
aSe depressant in initio.
§ Vessels.—The fact of the vaso-dilating action of aldoxime being so feeble seemed
first to militate against the presence of any nitrite-like body. This can now be
@plained by the vaso-constrictory influence of aldehyde, and by the excessive weight
of aldehyde present in the aldoxime molecule.
‘wThe fact that a mixture of blood and aldoxime, after standing, acquires a
Seater dilating influence is to be accounted for, I take it, by the disappearance
By part of the aldehyde, either by oxidation or evaporation. Nitrous acid will not be
tet. It will be present in the form of sodium nitrite, which salt we know is
easily oxidizable.
-3Heart.—Finally, in its action on the heart, we find the tonic effect of aldoxime
tSpified in aldehyde, the acceleration of rhythm in nitrites, and the secondary
@pressant action in both bodies.
