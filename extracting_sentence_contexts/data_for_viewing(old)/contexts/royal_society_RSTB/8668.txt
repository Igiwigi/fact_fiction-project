hand, voltage-gated K* channels (VGPCs) commonly control cellular prolifer-
ation in which VGSC activity plays no role [8,9]. In addition, VGPCs may be
downregulated as cancer becomes more aggressive [2,8]. Such dichotomy in
VGSC-VGPC expression in cancer is consistent with the notion that primary
and secondary tumours are associated with expression of different genes and
can even be controlled independently [10].

Expression and/or activity of VGICs can be regulated from transcription
to post-translation. These include specific mechanisms of post-transcription/
pre-translation, e.g. miRNAs [11] and post-translation, e.g. intracellular traffick-
