with this lower incidence. Instead, for non-Kenema districts,
the Contact Line List was provided to local health officials
in those districts after case investigations were conducted.
Further comparisons to Lassa fever are limited, as secondary
human-to-human transmission of Lassa fever occurs less fre-
quently than Ebola [22]. The cumulative effect of having a
higher frequency of EVD cases resulted in an exponential
growth in contacts needing monitoring, and in Kenema dis-
trict, the response to that growing need for further resources
took more time than the outbreak could afford.

In Kenema district, despite the high completion rate
(89%) of the 21-day monitoring period, the fact that the out-
break persisted for 10 months in this district indicates that
there were significant gaps in case investigation, contact tra-
cing and contact monitoring. In the first months of the EVD
emergency in Sierra Leone, the district coordination centre
at KGH was the acting coordination centre for all EVD
data in Sierra Leone, which created a heavy burden on
the small Kenema surveillance team. Case Investigation
Forms, when filled out, were sent with specimens from
neighbouring districts, primarily Kailahun, and required
entry into a primary database. Initial attempts at using
