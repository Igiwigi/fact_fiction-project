To simplify the problem, in this paper, we only consider
those signals that have one dominated shape function, ie. M=1 in (1.3). By exploring the fact
that the shape function is a periodic function of the phase function, @, we can identify a certain
low-rank structure of the signal. This structure enables us to extract the shape function from the
signal. We remark that, in the model with the shape function, all intra-wave modulation is captured
by the shape function.
