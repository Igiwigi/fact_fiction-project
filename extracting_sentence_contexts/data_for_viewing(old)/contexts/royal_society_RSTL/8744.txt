S Nearly all the yoyagers of the 16th and 17th centuries who have left accounts of
'S their adventures and discoveries in the Indian and Pacific Oceans mention the occur-
= rence, in certain isolated islands or groups of islands, of gigantic Land-Tortoises in
= countless numbers. The islands on which they met with these animals, although all
XZ between the equator and southern tropic, form two most distant zoological stations,
[=] widely different in their physical characteristics. One of those stations was the
- Galapagos Islands, the other comprised Aldabra, R6union, Mauritius, and Rodriguez.
Â© But they had this in common, that at the time of their discovery they were unin-
_ habited by man or even some larger terrestrial mammal. Not one of those yoyagers
VS ever mentions having met with those Tortoises in any other island of the tropics or in
= any portion of the Indian continent ; and it is not likely that one or the other should
5 not haye mentioned the fact if he had seen them in some novel locality. In fact
A the hardy sailors of that period took the greatest interest in these animals, which
were to them a most important article of food. At a time when a voyage now
performed in a few weeks took as many months, when every vessel, for defence sake
and from other causes, carried as many people as it was possible to pack into her,
when provisions were rudely cured and but few in kind, those tortoises which could be
captured in any number with the greatest ease within a few days proved to be a most
welcome addition to the stock. The animals could be carried in the hold of the ship
or in any other part, without food, for months, and were slaughtered as occasion
required, each tortoise yielding, according to size, from 80 to 200 pounds of whole-
