Whether or not this hypothesis of the origin of a Lycopod strobilus approaches the
actual truth, comparison points out the genus Lycopediwm as a primitive one; but
other forms more or less closely related to them are characterised by more complex
sporangial arrangements; the increase of the individual sporangium, as in Lepidodendron
and Jsoetes, has been noted elsewhere,t and evidence has been brought forward of
the probability of septation of the sporangium in the case of Z'mesipteris, and less
clearly of Psilotum,{ while a somewhat similar origin seems not improbable for the
plurality of sporangia borne on the sporangiophores of some Sphenophyllee.§ Again,
the view put forward for the spike of Ophioglossum involves similar questions of
increase,|| as also that for the still more complex spike of Helminthostachys, with its
lateral ranks of sporangiophores ; lastly, the sporangiophore of Hquisetum shows a
near analogy in form to these several sporangium-bearing bodies, while the sori of
certain Ferns have a somewhat similar conformation.’ These facts make it necessary
to consider what is the real nature of those bodies which are designated by the non-
committing term “ sporangiophore ” ?

In taking up a question of this nature it is necessary to have an open mind as to
“ morphological dignity,” and especially so as the organisms involved are all low in
the scale of vascular plants; their morphology must not be dominated by ideas
derived from Phanerogamic plants. In treating them, their evolutionary position
should be constantly borne in mind; their chief types were laid down before
Angiosperms appeared, and accordingly their morphology should be studied with the
same freedom as if the higher organisms had never existed. The practice of referring
every part of the shoot to some modification of axis or leaf, emergence or hair, has
already been broken down in the case of sporangia,** and there is just reason to be
