solve the equation a*—126647+48462=0. The two roots of this equation are such
that they give as the corresponding lengths of the day, 5 hours 16 minutes and 40-4 days
regpectively. The remaining discrepancy (between 40 and 48) is doubtless due in part

to the crude method of amending the solution, but also to the fact that they partly in-
clude the obliquity in one way, whilst I partly include it in another way, and I include
a large part of the solar tidal friction whilst they neglect it. It is interesting to note
that the larger root, which gives the shorter length of day, is but little affected by the
consideration of the earth's heterogeneity.

With respect to the second s0lution (56 days), it must be remarked that the sun's
tidal friction will go on lengthening the day even beyond this point, but then the
lunar tides will again come into existence, and the lunar tidal friction will tend in part
to counteract the 8olar. The tidal reaction will also be reversed, 80 that the moon
will again approach the earth. Thus the effect of the sun is to make this a state of
dynamical instability.
