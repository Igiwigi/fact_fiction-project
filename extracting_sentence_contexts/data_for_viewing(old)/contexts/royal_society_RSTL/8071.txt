sages, no matter how complicated, under the single restriction as to the comparative
magnitudes of the reservoirs and waye-lengths; but the example just given is sufficient
to illustrate the theory of multiple resonance. In Part III, a resonator of this sort will
be described, which was constructed for the sake of a comparison between the theory
and experiment. Tn applying the formule (6) or (12) to an actual measurement, the
question will arise whether the yolume of the necks, especially when they are rather
large, is to be included or not in S$. At the moment of rest the air in the neck is com-

pressed or rarefied as well as that inside the reservoir, though not to the same degree;
in fact the condensation must yary continuously between the interior of the resonator
and the external air. This consideration shows that, at least in the case of necks which
are tolerably symmetrical, about half the volume of the neck should be included in S.

[In consequence of a suggestion made by Mr. Clerk Maxweir, who reported on this
paper, I have been led to examine what Kind of effect would be produced by a deficient
rigidity in the envelope which contains the alternately compressed and rarefied air.
Taking for simplicity the case of a sphere, let us suppose that the radins, instead of
remaining constant at its normal yalue R, assumes the yariable magnitude R++g. We
