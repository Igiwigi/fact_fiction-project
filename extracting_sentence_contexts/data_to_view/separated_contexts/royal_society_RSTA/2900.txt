Based on some recent works concerned with the dynamical properties of rotational
NESs, one may wonder whether its applicability for broadband vibration absorption can be
enhanced. The first attempt to answer this question can be found in some relatively recent work
by Farid & Gendelman [44]. It is a well-known fact that the usual NES designs possess quite obvious drawbacks when
exploited for vibration suppression in mechanical models subjected to impulsive loading as they
are efficient only in the limited range of initial excitation energies. The reason for this limitation
is quite simple. As we have already pointed out above, the mechanism of TET is completely
based on a transient resonance capture.
