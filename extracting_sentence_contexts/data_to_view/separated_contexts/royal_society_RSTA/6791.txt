accounts also for the fact that the agreement between theory and experiment is not vitiated
by the crystallization of the rubber in the immediate neighbourhood of the hole resulting
from its state of great extension. The slight fall in the value of a, for which agreement is obtained between the experimental
and theoretical results, occurring at the highest value considered of A—and therefore of
J,—is in qualitative agreement with the fall of @W/dJ, with increase in J, indicated in part VII. It should be borne in mind, however, that the results obtained for the lower values of A
could be very nearly equally well fitted if a value of a of 0-08 were taken in carrying out the
calculations.
