few 10°s~! to 10°s~! were attained by Volger [27]. Ceramic materials can also be characterized 3
using these generators. Indeed, Zinszner et al. [28,29] have performed ICE on silicon carbides : a

following limitations. In addition to being costly and complex, these experiments are limited to {2

small samples due to the fact that the applied magnetic pressure is inversely proportional to the
square of the electrode’s width (Laplace effect), and the rise time associated with each device is

fixed and cannot be easily changed. Additionally, due to high-intensity electromagnetic fields, it : &
is not possible to use pressure gauges with the samples being tested because of strong electric Dos

For this reason, several authors have explored the possibility of performing ICE with plate- 73
impact testing devices by using heterogeneous or layered material systems which smooth aes
the loading pulse. Several experimental, analytical and numerical studies are reported in the 22
literature on the shock response developed by these plate-impact testing systems. In particular, : Ss
