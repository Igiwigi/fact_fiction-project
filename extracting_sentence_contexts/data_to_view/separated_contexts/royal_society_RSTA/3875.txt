This analysis offers several advantages compared with the point- : =
by-point method, such as the considerable reduction in time and the possibility to use higher laser : S
powers without damaging the sample. 2

One of the last frontiers of scientific research is the combination of Raman and SEM techniques aed
by means of an interface that allows the molecular analysis of samples to be carried out inside 22
the vacuum chamber of the SEM system [26]. Because of the optical system connecting both : S
instruments, it is possible to take advantage of the magnification feature of SEM systems to : s
collect the molecular vibration spectra of compounds that cannot be detected through the use : Ss
of conventional techniques. : =

Fortunately, the role of analytical chemistry is not limited to the description of metallic alloys
and their degradation compounds. In fact, it must be considered that each archaeological object
has specific degradation problems and a customized restoration protocol has to be designed to
properly conserve it. For this reason, a further contribution of analytical research is to devise
experiments that help to predict the consequences of applying restoration treatments to a specific
object. Several scientific articles have focused on the study of the effect of desalination baths applied to
iron-based archaeological items.
