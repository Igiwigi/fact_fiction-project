been in the modelling and analysis of longitudinal (2008), for example, reviews some of these problems
traits such as body weight which changes over time. and suggests methods for dealing with them. The variances and covariances can be described directly
by continuous covariance functions (Kirkpatrick &
Heckman 1989) or, equivalently, as parameters of
random regression coefficients (Schaeffer & Dekkers
1994). The generality of the animal model and the fact that
most field data (whether humans, livestock or natural
populations) are highly unbalanced have created a
need for sophisticated and general analytical methods. These use restricted maximum likelihood (REML) or
Bayesian principles, facilitated by the availability of
specialized computer packages (see reviews by those
much involved in their development: Thompson
2008; Sorensen & Gianola 2002). Developments
continue, stimulated by the need to deal with non-
standard data, e.g. on discrete-valued traits, and to
incorporate information on multiple marker genes.
