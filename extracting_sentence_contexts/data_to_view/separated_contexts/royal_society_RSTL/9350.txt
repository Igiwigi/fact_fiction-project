24. It is interesting to notice why in the expressions for 1/ab, &e., the sign con-
necting the two radicals is + ; the effect of the interchange of a; y is in fact to change
(1, v) into (=u, —») ; consequently to change the sign of the odd functions, and to
leave unaltered those of the even functions : the interchange does in fact leave 1a,
&c., unaltered, while it changes ad, &ec., into —ab, &c. ; and thus, since only the
ratios are attended to, there is a change of sign as there should be. 25. The equations of the product-theorem lead to expressions for
