such extrapolation factor, indicative values of 1.2 + 1.3 may be derived from land-based HAWTs
(see [9,10] or Annex F in [2] for the characteristic moment at the blade root). Therefore, multiplying
the values in tables 5 and 6 by a 1.35 load safety factor and also by a 1.3 extrapolation factor for the
operational load cases, it can readily be observed that the derived demands would be smaller than
the earthquake demands obtained for the highest levels of PGA, as reported in figures 7 and 8.
It is also worth noting that, at the pile head and blade root of the Tripod, earthquake demands
would be higher also for moderate levels of PGA. In particular, at the blade root, this holds true
for the flexible FM (figure 7).

Although the considered operational and parked states are certainly not exhaustive, and
other important loads shall be considered in design analyses, such as fatigue loads, the results
discussed above substantiate the need for an accurate seismic assessment of offshore HAWTs, also
in recognition of the fact that no load safety factor has been applied to earthquake demands when
