have to be considered, significant H-defects interactions are not expected at these temperatures : =
unless H activity in the lattice is high. But the H activity was usually considered to be low oo

assuming that it is controlled by the imposed amount of hydrogen dissolved in the primary water
(35 cm? kg~! at 320°C) corresponding to a fairly low hydrogen fugacity at the water/metal
interface (about 0.3 atm).

(i) Identification of the hydrogen source in primary water

In fact, two main hydrogen sources are available for metals exposed to primary water. Besides H2
dissolved in the water, as previously mentioned, the water dissociation associated with oxidation
reactions on the metal surface may be another source of hydrogen. Moreover thermodynamic
considerations on the stability of oxide films grown on alloy 600 in these conditions suggest that
the associated hydrogen fugacity could be very high. In order to identify the most effective H
source, isotopic tracing of hydrogen was conducted with deuterium for alloy 600 exposed to
primary water [21]. For this purpose, some samples of alloy 600 where exposed, in the same
conditions, to primary water elaborated with either heavy water (98% D20O) pressurized with H2
or natural water with a D2 overpressure. After rapid cooling of the samples, secondary ion mass
spectrometry (SIMS) profiling of 7D and !©O was conducted in order to compare the resulting
deuterium concentration profiles together with the oxide films grown on the surface during
exposure. According to the profiles reported in figure 4, the effective H source can be identified:
almost no deuterium absorption is recorded for the H2O/Dz environment (in figure 4a the
