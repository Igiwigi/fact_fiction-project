Red Crag period. The close contiguity of the Coralline Crag and the temporary
survival of some of the Mollusca which flourished in the conditions proper to that
earlier deposit, as well as the washing up of their broken shells into beds deposited
later than those during the deposition of which they were living, have assisted
in leading geologists to assign to the Red Crag an earlier age than that which is
proper to it. The line between Pliocene and Pleistocene should be, I submit, drawn
at the commencement of the glacial conditions which set in at the beginning of the
Red Crag deposit, and that line should separate the Coralline from the Red Crag.
The former is still Pliocene, the latter is the earliest Pleistocene. An important
piece of evidence in this matter, proving that the basal deposit of the Red Crag, the
bone-bed or detritus-bed of Suffolk, was subsequent to the glaciation of the land
surface, is the discovery by Mr. Morr of glacial scratching on the humanly fractured
flints found in that basal deposit. The evidence of this most important fact is given
below (text-figs. 17, 19, 21, and Plate 17). It comes as a confirmation of a conclusion
arrived at by Lyeni from the presence in the basal beds of huge unworn chalk
flints. He says (‘Student's Elements of Geology,’ 1874, p. 182) :

“ The transport of blocks by ice, when the Red Crag was being deposited, appears
to me evident from the huge size of some irregular, quite unrounded chalk flints,
retaining their white coating, and 2 feet long by 18 inches broad, in beds worked for
phosphatic nodules at Foxhall, four miles south-east of Ipswich. These must have
been tranquilly drifted to the spot by floating ice. Mr. Prestwicu also mentions
