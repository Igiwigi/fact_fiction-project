The others
may be considered as receiving a sort of lateral displacement, by the atomic weight
term, in the recognised way, and may be called collaterals. This kind of displacement
is, however, not confined to the series generally recognised, but is of very common
occurrence, and, indeed, depends not only on the A but also on other multiples of 4. In fact, the doublet and triplet series are only special cases of a law of very wide
application. Some evidence of its existence will be given below. It will be sufficient
now only to refer to certain points connected with the law, and to a convenient
notation to represent it.
