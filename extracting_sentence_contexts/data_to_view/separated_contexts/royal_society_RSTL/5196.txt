I have mentioned that a third subtype appears to be formed by Spirialis and
Limacina, which are the only Pteropods with spiral shells. Spirialis, again, is the
only Pteropod with an operculum. But a more important difference for my present
purpose consists in the fact, that in these genera the mantle-cavity (and with it the
anus) opens on the dorsal side of the animal. I have not myself been fortunate
enough to obtain specimens of these genera, and as the attention of those anatomists
who have examined them does not appear to have been specially directed to this point,
it is impossible to make out with certainty whether the first flexure of the intestine
is also dorsal, or whether, as in all other Pteropods, it is ventral. I cannot think
that any real variation will be found to occur among closely allied forms, in a matter
s0 fundamentally connected with their whole structure and mode of development ;
and I would suggest that here also the bend of the intestine is truly ventral, but that
by a continuation of the process by which the anus is thrown to the left side in Cleodora
and to the right in Pneumodermon, it (with the branchial cavity) is thrown to the
dorsal side in Limacina and Spirialis.
