Observation showed that snch a difference of curvature existed. In one
experiment the sagittz of the spherical segments differed by 1:15 mm., which
diminished after 45‚Äù to 0'1 mm. When the system had apparently reached a
rmanent state the plate was reversed, the upper and lower bubbles exchanged
laces, and the fact that the measurements were to within the error of experiment
& same as before was taken as evidence that the phenomenon observed was not due
any inequality produced directly by the weight of the films. S The investigations of these observers have not left the question of the relation
Setween the surface tension and the thickness of a liquid film in a satisfactory state.
