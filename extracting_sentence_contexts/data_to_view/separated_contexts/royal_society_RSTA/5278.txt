As soon as matter is locally moved, however, its motion may readily produce
effect, for it has no potential conditions to satisfy ; it may easily be moved in a clo
contour. Suppose it moves with velocity u, always with the light, the relative dri
of ether thereby caused in it must, as above, be u/n*, and so it may be said to virtua
carry the ether inside it forward with velocity u — u/y? ; for that is the amount t
which it affects the time of journey of a ray. This does not mean that it carr’
with it any ether of space; in fact, it definitely means that it does not appreciab
disturb the ether of space (ef. § 3, b). : The equation to a ray in moving matter, subject to an independent ether drift, is
