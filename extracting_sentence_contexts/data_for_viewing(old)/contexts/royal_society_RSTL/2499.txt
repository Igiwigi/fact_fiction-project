of course freeze the water which touches them.” It is unnecessary to examine here
whether heat radiates through a thick layer of water, as Mr. M'KEgver supposes, as
the most simple observation is sufficient to overthrow it. Where is the person who
has not observed that the strong radiation, which the Irish philosopher admits, would
be more plainly manifested, or as completely, in still water than in running water ?
but no one has seen a piece of still water frozen at the bottom *,”

But there is nothing more easy of experimental proof than that heat radiates through
water. IT do not mean, however, to vindicate the reasoning of Mr. M'Kzgver re-
specting the more powerful radiation of it from stones than from mud. His reason-
ing respecting that matter is, on his own part, conjectural, to explain the readier
formation of gru on a stony or gravelly bottom ; but the gru also forms on a muddy
bottom, a fact which M. Araco notices, when he brings the attachment of mud to
the under side of the floating flakes as a proof that they haye been formed at the
bottom. Mr. MKegver was driven to his conjecture from having overlooked the
more complete and sudden inversion of the hydrostatic order that takes place over
stones than over mud ; which last is deposited only in places where the water has a
stiller and more equable motion. In snch places the ground-gru is later in forming,
and therefore is more rarely seen; and it is doubtful whether Mr. M'Kezver had a
proper opportunity for noticing it in them.

But to return to the main point which we have here to maintain in opposition to
the reasoning of M. Araco, the radiation of heat through a body of water. When
we construct an achromatic object-glass for a telescope, it does not the less remain a
burning-lens when we have included in it a transparent fluid, and no experiment has
