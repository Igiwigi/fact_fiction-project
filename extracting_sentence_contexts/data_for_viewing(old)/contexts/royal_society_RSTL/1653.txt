blood circulating in the vessels of the body? The diluting
the blood with large quantities of water, as proposed by Dr.
CrawFoRD, does not altogether remove the objection, for this
only retards, it does not prevent coagulation, and some time
must, at any rate, elapse, while the blood is flowing and the
quantity is being measured, during which the separation of its
solid and fluid parts will have begun to take place.

More might be said on this subject ; but I feel anxious to
avoid, as much as possible, controversial discussion. It is my .
wish not to advance opinions, but simply to state some facts,
which I have met with in the course of my physiological in-
vestigations. These facts, I am willing to hope, possess some
value; and they may perhaps lead to the developement of other
facts of much greater importance. Physiology is yet in its in-
fant state. It embraces a great number and variety of phe-
nomena, and of these it is very difficult to obtain an accurate
and satisfactory knowledge ; but it is not unreasonable to ex-
pect, that by the successive labours of individuals, and the
faithful register of their observations, it may at last be enabled
to assume the form of a more perfect science.
