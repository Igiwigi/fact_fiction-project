Unloading begins between frames 4 and 5
and several radial and lateral cracks form (see frame 5), which continue to grow for another
microsecond after the sphere has left the surface of the glass block (see L in frame 6). It will
also be seen that in frame 5, a dark protrusion has just appeared on the glass surface around
the contact during the unloading (i.e. rebound) of the sphere. This dark protrusion is, in fact, a
ring of detached B03, which leaves the impact surface in a direction normal to it at a velocity
of 135ms~! and a dent is left behind in the glass surface. This rebound velocity of the sphere is
relatively high, being about 85% of the incident velocity. This relatively high rebound velocity
is reasonable, as little or no loss of energy occurs because of the absence of any cracking during
the loading part of the impact.
