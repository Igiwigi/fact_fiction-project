Physics shows us such a transition; so, under question is not its existence, rather
the way we describe it. This type of questions motivates foundational analyses of models and/or theories (per se
classes of interconnected models). A question remains in fact vigilant every time we construct
a model: What are we actually doing? Clarifying what is at the ground of a model or, better, a theory has even practical effects,
besides its indisputable theoretical interest: it addresses, in fact, analytical and computational
choices; it allows one to better understand the nature of approximations, avoiding as much as
possible their ad hoc introduction only for the sake of convenience; it clarifies the nature of
boundary conditions, distinguishing those physically admissible from those that are not so. In
short, besides their clarifying nature, such a type of analysis may have not only have an inspiring
role for mechanics and pure mathematics but also an inspiriting role.
