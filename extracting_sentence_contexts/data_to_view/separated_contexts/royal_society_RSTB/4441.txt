lactic acid. It will be noted that in this case the first resting period after the stop of the
exercise is much longer than in the other experiments. As a matter of fact there
were two periods, but on switching the expired air from the first bag into the second
the watch was by accident not stopped, though the approximate position of the hand
was noted, and on this occasion it was impossible to distinguish the transition from
the first to the second bag on the polygraph tracing of the respirations. In order
to reckon the respiratory exchange accurately, the two periods had therefore to be
taken together. The first sample tovuk approximately 14 minutes to collect, and
