studies, the largest of which had 9904 samples. Meta-analysis
of these 9904 samples explained 2% of the phenotypic variance,
while the 4.8% represented results from meta-analysis of a
subset of 1558 samples. The laudatory Nature editorial [54]
sums up these statistics by stating: ‘The associations ... could
explain up to 4.8% of the variance in intelligence across these
cohorts.’ Even if one believed in the underlying linear statistical
models that gave this result, 4.8% does not seem worth writing
home about. Indeed, as Nisbett et al. [38, p. 135] write, ‘It may
simply be that the number of genes involved in an outcome as
complex as intelligence is very large, and therefore the contri-
bution of any individual locus is just as small as the number
of genes is large.’ In fact, Chabris et al. [55] augment Turkhei-
mer’s three laws of behaviour genetics with a fourth law that
summarizes many GWAS studies of behavioural traits.

(1) A typical human behavioural trait is associated with very
many genetic variants, each of which accounts for a very
small percentage of behavioural variability.

5. Personality and attitudes

Cognitive ability assessed through IQ tests is just one of the
many complex human behavioural traits whose ‘genetics’
has been investigated using data from twins. Personality
