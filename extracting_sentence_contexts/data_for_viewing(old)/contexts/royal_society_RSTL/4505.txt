common centre of gravity.

Writing x 41 for that diſtance, divided by the
centre of gravity in the ratio. of x to 1; imagine a
ſphere of the ſame dimenſions as our earth, placed
at that centre, to exert the ſame attra&tive force on
the Moon as our Earth a&tually does, the periodic
time remaining unaltered : then muſt the denſity of

this ſphere be diminiſhed in the ratio of x* to x+ 1],
that its nearer diſtance from the Moon may be com-
penſated by the defe&t of denſity and attraQive force.
If now an inhabitant of the fictitious earth were ſup-
poſed to compute its diſtance from the Moon, in
the manner juft now ſhewn; the quantities V and
D would be the fame as.in the former calculation';
but his / would be.to our. F, as: x* to. x+ 17, and

thence, his x would be' to'our X as x® to x17,
