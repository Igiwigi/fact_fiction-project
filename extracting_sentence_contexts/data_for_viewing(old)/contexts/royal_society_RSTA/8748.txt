where U is any arbitrary vector function we shall have

where

TVe=iT— | div Udr,

and 8’ and T’ are appropriate forms for a new mode of separation. In this way, by
assigning convenient values for U, we might tentatively construct a number of
interesting formule.

The last result also shows why it is that the particular form pee for the kinetic
energy is irrelevant to the general dynamical discussion of paragraph 7. In fact,
if, instead of the form T used on that occasion, we had employed the general value
derived above

T= | div Ude
the part of the variation depending on this energy becomes the time integral of
aT | div 8U dr,

and the latter integral reduces toa surface integral over the infinitely distant boundary
and cannot therefore contribute anything in this general variational equation.

Of course, from another point of view, the various forms of the theory here under
review, differ merely in assigning different distributions to the magnetic energy in the
