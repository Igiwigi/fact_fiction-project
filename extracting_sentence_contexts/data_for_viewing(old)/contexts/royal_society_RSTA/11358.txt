The wires were heated in a horizontal position and the diameters measured in
millimetres.

The diameter of the wire used was 44 millims. Inserting this value for d in the
above formule gives for the value of the emissivity at 200° and 300° C. 00144
and ‘00150 C.G.S. units. The values given in Curve L, fig. 7, are 00107 and ‘00121.
The largest wires used in establishing the above formule were 14 millims. It is
therefore not surprising if, after extrapolating for a wire over three times this
diameter, the calculated and experimental values differ considerably. This diver-
gence is also in some degree accounted for by the fact that the enclosures used
in the two cases were of an entirely different shape and size.

In a paper recently published, Mr. C. F. Bruss gives a number of observations
“on the transmission of heat by gases,” at temperatures of from 0° to 15° C.
Unfortunately it is impossible to reduce these to absolute units. The relative
value of the emissivity in air and in hydrogen is much the same as that which may
be deduced at some hundred degrees higher from fig. 2. My measurements show
that the emissivity in carbon dioxide is greater than in air at high temperatures,
converging to the same value at 150°C. At about 10° C., according to Mr. C. F
Brus, the relative value of the emissivity in these two gases is reversed.

Many formule have been given, principally with regard to radiation in vacuo ;
