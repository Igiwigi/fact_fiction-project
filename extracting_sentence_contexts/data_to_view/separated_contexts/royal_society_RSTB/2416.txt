This appears to me to be a very significant fact, and a definite support of the view that there is a close
casual relation between the filmy character and a lower spore-output in’ certain Osmundacew and in the
Hymenophyllacew.

while the facts of output of spores per sporangium, and of structure of the sporangia
above stated, appear to me to add considerable weight to the evidence. I look upon
the Hymenophyllaceee as a blind line of descent characterised by specialisation of
both generations, which has taken the form of simplification ; and in both generations
Trichomanes shows the greater simplicity. Comparison of their sporangia, however,
and especially their spore-output, suggest that they were derived from some ancestry
with simultaneous sporangia.
