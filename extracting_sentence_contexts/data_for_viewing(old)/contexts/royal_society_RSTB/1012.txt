In connection with this subject the nervous relation between the flushed ar
the buttocks, thighs, and tail of M. rhesus and the vagina is of interest. Th
researches of LANGLEY and SHERRINGTON (36) and SHERRINGTON (66 and 67)

the sensory roots of these nerves supply the flushed area described above.
is always more or less flushed in M. rhesus, but is specially noticeable in the }
during menstruation and pregnancy, when it is very highly congested, and y
undoubtedly appear to be influenced by sexual phenomena. 4
The uterus of the Rabbit, however, according to Lanezny’s (35) obser f
receives motor fibres from the sympathetic chain, from about the IVth to the
lumbar ganglia, and is not certainly affected by stimulation of the sacral nerves,
I have mentioned these facts because the swelling which is observed roun
external generative organs of animals during the season of “ heat,” is probably h
logous with the enormously swollen area exhibited by certain Baboons dw

this time, and it is of interest to know that there is a nervous connection betwe
these parts and the vagina.
A further examination of the physiological relation between the vagina an¢
uterus would probably throw much light upon the origin of menstruation and “hea
In conclusion, it appears to me that sufficient stress has not been laid upon t
different periods of the menstrual process, and that a consideration of them, alth
it does not explain the origin, leads to an explanation of the function of menstruatio
