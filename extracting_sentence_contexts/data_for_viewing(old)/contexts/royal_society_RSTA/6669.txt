method by Tsien e¢ al. (1946), who confirmed the principal results described in this paper.
The range distribution and the abundance ratio deduced by those authors also agree with
those described above. Tsien et al. have made estimates of the masses of the light particles,
based on the measured angles of deflexion of the fission fragment tracks, as described in
a previous section. They state that some of the particles have masses differing significantly
from that of the a-particle, and they quote two cases of emission of particles with mass
numbers equal to 9-+ 2. However, it is to be emphasized that the results of these calculations

are subject to large errors, for several reasons previously specified. On this point the results
of this paper do not agree with the deductions of Tsien et al., since they indicate that in all
cases the estimated mass is consistent with a single mass number of 4.

If the results of all the experiments are considered, the following facts concerning the
emission of light nuclei in the fission of U2" by slow neutrons may be regarded as established:

(i) A light nueleus is emitted in approximately 1 % of fission events, and in one-quarter
of these cases the range exceeds that of the fission fragments. :

(ii) The range of the light nucleus takes all values up to a limit exceeding 55cm. air
equivalent.

(iii) The specific ionization of the particle is similar to that of the «-particle.

(iv) The average mass number is very nearly 4.
