ception of those short portions extending into Glen Collarig. It will be seen that
both these lines, if continued round the hill of Bohuntine (at the eastern entrance of
Glen Roy), would insulate it, whilst the lower shelf only forms it into a peninsula.
From this structure it will be evident, that in order to form Glen Roy into a lake
at either of the two upper levels, it would be necessary to erect two barriers, one
across Glen Collarig, and the other principal one across the mouth of the Roy.

The lines are here represented as if abruptly cut off, but this is not 80; and the
following remark holds good in other cases, namely, that where a shelf terminates
without any visible change in the nature of the slope, snch as being rocky, &c., its
disappearance is s0 extremely gradual, that it can be traced, sometimes to a further
and sometimes to a lesser distance, according to the point from which it is viewed.
Of this fact the shelves on the south-east side of Glen Collarig offer an excellent ex-
ample. In the map, the extremities of the lower of the two upper shelves are re-
presented at the four places where they terminate, as extending beyond those of the
upper one. I tate this on the authority of Sir Lavper Dick with respect to those
in Glen Roy, and it is conspicuously the case with that pair in Glen Collarig which
I have described as disappearing in 80 insensible a manner. The lower line can
there be traced, though faintly, to a point below the houses of the glen opposite a
small tributary torrent, and therefore considerably beyond (or nearer the mouth) than
the point where the 972 feet shelf crosses the bottom of the valley. Observing in Glen
Collarig the gradual disappearance of either set of lines, and that there is not the
smallest apparent cause for it in the nature of the ground, the first and obvious sup-
position is that a sheet of water extended from the Spean into Glen Roy and Collarig,
and that the mere widening of the mouths of the latter, as they approached the less
