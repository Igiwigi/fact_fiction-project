852 eV Ni L3-edge, which is sensitive to antiferromagnetic order in the material. Significant peak
broadening and suppression of the Laue oscillations, which indicate sharp boundaries of the
magnetic order at equilibrium, were observed after optical excitation of the substrate. This result
indicates that the optical excitation melts the magnetic order only over a fraction of the film, and
yields an estimate of the speed at which this melting occurs. Recently, this interpretation was
substantiated by phasing the diffraction patterns to show that these dynamics indeed arise from
a propagating demagnetization front launched at the interface [53].

Figure 2b shows additional measurements of the time dependent (2% 2% 2%) reflection,
measured at X-ray energies resonant (8.346 keV, blue data) and off-resonant (8.329 keV, green
data) with the Ni K-edge. The measured resonant diffraction intensity comprises a charge-order
contribution to the Bragg scattering (illustrated by the grey shaded region), which disappears
promptly and in fact before the lattice has completely rearranged. Figure 2c illustrates how
the lattice, magnetic and insulator-metal dynamics evolve as different types of order-disorder
fronts that propagate from the interface into the functional film at different speeds. Presumably,
charge order melting is the driving force of these dynamics, as its phase front advances ahead of
demagnetization and structural relaxation.

4. Light-induced superconductivity in single-layer cuprates

High-T, superconductivity is found in many layered cuprates, of which Laz_,Ba,;CuOy is a
prototypical example [54]. This material crystallizes in a perovskite structure composed by a
stacking of CuOz layers separated by two La/Ba-O planes along the crystal c-axis (figure 3a).
Superconductivity is obtained from the antiferromagnetic parent compound (LazCuO4) by
doping holes into the CuO, planes, through substitution of LaÂ°+ with Ba?+ atoms. The
