It should be noticed, that there may be seyeral modes of arrangement of the
vertices and faces of the second polyedron, which will render it syntypic according to the foregoing definition
with the first polyedron, 5. e. the second polyedron may be syntypic in 8everal different ways with the first
polyedron. This is, in fact, the same as saying that a polyedron may be syntypic with itself in several
different ways. Suppose, next, that the number of yertices of the second polyedron is equal to the number
of faces of the first polyedron, and the number of faces of the second polyedron is equal to the number of
vertices of the first polyedron. And let the vertices and faces of the first polyedron in any order be repre-
