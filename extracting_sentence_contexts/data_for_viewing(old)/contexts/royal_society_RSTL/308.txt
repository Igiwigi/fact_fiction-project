the three days, to have loaded all the ships then in com-
pany. That they found them for the space of between twenty
and thirty leagues in length, and in breadth, to the east, from
three to five leagues, as the ships stood off and on ; but how
much farther to the east, and a few other points, they might
extend, these persons cannot pretend to say, such points being
out of their course for the ports they were destined to. That
most of the fish were dead, though some were alive, as ap-
peared by a slight motion of the tail, but in a very weak,
feeble state, and unable to sink in the water.

In the above particulars Messrs. STokER and ARMSTRONG
perfectly agree, as to the truth of the fact. The latter,
through cautious timidity, prevented his crew from taking up
any of the fish; but the former took on board many, both dead
and in a dying state, of which he first ate, and then suffered
his men to do the same: and at Archangel gave the remainder
to the customhouse officers, without any person receiving
the least injury. Mr. SToKER having, previous to eating the
fish, tried the usual experiment at sea, of putting silver into
the fresh water wherein the fish were boiled, the silver was
not at all discoloured.

Talking with Mr. SToxER, in his parlour, I asked him how
many fish he could take up in that or any other given Space.
