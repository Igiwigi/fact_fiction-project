Plate 2 shows the pressures at the breech and at the base of the projec-
tile, their ratio, the mean pressure, the displacement and velocity of the projectile, and
a certain ‘“* energy factor ” as functions of the time. The mean pressure (P in Table I.)
is that which the cordite gases would have after adiabatic expansion, at uniform density,
to the volume which they actually occupy at time ¢. The work of expansion in these
circumstances will be equal, not to the kinetic energy of the projectile, but to a greater
kinetic energy corresponding to a fictitious mass M+«C, where

\Phw
i (M+aC) V? = aco(2 1) [1-(2) iF

The “ energy factor ”’ a may be expected to vary with the distance travelled by the
projectile: the lower values given are only approximate. It is difficult, after a glance at Plate 2, to resist the conclusion that the motion is
tending to a limiting form, in which the pressure is approximately represented by
f(y) ¢(), with suitable functions /, ¢. The energy factor « oscillates about a mean
value of approximately 1/3, and the range of oscillation diminishes in time: similarly
the pressure ratio oscillates about a value of approximately 0-9.
