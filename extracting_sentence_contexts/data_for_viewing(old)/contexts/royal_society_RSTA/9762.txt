separated images was seen ; but if the optical contact held, the grinding was so perfect
that it was barely possible to recognise the double character of the image reflected
from the ends of the column of quartz, the error in parallelism being probably only a
fraction of a minute of are.

4, The awis of the quartz, which in the earlier plates had been located in the ordinary
way by means of the interference rings, was set much more carefully in the later
plates, using the very sensitive method described by J. Wanker (‘ Phil. Mag.,’ 1909,
vol, 18, 195). The error in setting the axis normal to the surfaces was estimated not
to exceed 5 minutes of are. As the cylinders could be tilted more than this without
increasing the readings, there was no reason to suppose that the setting was not
sufficiently accurate, even when taking readings to 0°°0001 per mm. This conclusion
is all the more reasonable in view of the fact that readings concordant within about
0°°001 per mm. have been obtained by a number of different workers for the optical
rotations of sodium light in thin plates of quartz, set to axis by the rougher methods
generally in use.

5. The temperature was maintained at 20° C. by means of a generous flow of water
at constant temperature. The spiral gas-regulator used in the thermostat was of the
pattern designed in 1905 (‘ Trans. Chem. Soe.,’ 1905, vol. 87, 1030-1034) and was
capable of maintaining the temperature of the well-stirred bath, over long periods,
within 0°°01 of the desired temperature. The water was drawn out of the bath and
through the jackets by means of an Albany pump of 4-inch bore, the arrangements
being in other respects very similar to those described and figured in an earlier paper
(‘ Trans. Faraday Soc.,’ 1907, vol. 3,119). As the pump works best with an ample flow
