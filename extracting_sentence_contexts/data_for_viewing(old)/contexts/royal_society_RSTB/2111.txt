On the part of the visible spectrum which opens the stomata,

There can be no doubt that light as distinguished from heat opens the stomata.
When a plant is closed by covering it with an opaque cylinder, the change is
essentially one of illumination, not of temperature.

Kout (95) is the first, so far as I know, to investigate the effect of different parts of
the spectrum on the stomata, He used incandescent gas and Reinke’s spectrophore ;
the experimental plant was 7’rianea, and was examined microscopically. He makes
out the interesting fact that the red light between B and C and the blue from F
to the beginning of the violet are the only efficient parts of the spectrum. The

conclusions which Kout draws will be discussed in the section on the mechanism of
the stoma.*

My own results agree so far with Kout’s, that I find the red end of the spectrum
the efficient part ; I cannot, however, discover that the blue end has any decided
effect. I began by illuminating my plants with sunshine passed through colour
screens, and as I had Landolt’s solutions, I used them, although they are not
