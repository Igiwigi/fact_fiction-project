The distinctive characters of Psettodes are: (1) spinous rays in fins; (2) supra-
maxillary ; (3) toothed palatines ; (4) two post-cleithra on each side. These are advanced Teleostean characters, however, found in no other Flat-fish. And, as a matter of fact, Psettodes stands quite isolated, not merely as a separate
genus or family, but even as a separate sub-order ; yet only one species is known.

Psettodes also possesses primitive characters: (1) dimorphism of optic chiasma ;
(2) urohyal a simple plate; (3) no abdominal balancing rod; (4) tri-segmented
radialia posteriorly. The combination of primitive body characters with advanced head characters is
not very remarkable; the connecting links are the postcleithra and spinous rays
anteriorly (also articulation of urohyal with basibranchial).
