or chemical etching processes [28] (figure 2/). A summary of previously fabricated SHSs that have
been evaluated in turbulent flow is presented in table 1. Most of these studies will be discussed
in detail in the following sections. However, before diving into turbulent waters, we first review
how SHSs have been shown to effectively reduce friction drag in laminar flow.

3. Superhydrophobic friction drag reduction in laminar flow

When liquid flows over a solid surface, the usual boundary condition assumed is that the velocity
of the liquid must match the velocity of the solid [41]. This is typically referred to as the ‘no-slip’
condition. However, SHSs possess a fraction of air (1 — ¢s) at the solid—liquid interface, which can
yield a non-zero slip velocity. In fact, Navier [42] first proposed a slip velocity, us, for solid surfaces
in 1823, where he suggested that the shear rate at the wall was proportional to u,. Although
somewhat different for a solid surface with a heterogeneous three-phase interface, one can extend
this same idea. For a two-dimensional flow, this is depicted in figure 3a,b and described by
