it follows that the primitive Lemuroids must have branched off from their hypothetical
Insectivore (Menotyphlous) ancestors before the latter had acquired a hemo-chorial
type of placenta and that accordingly, the placentation of the existing Menotyphla must
have developed quite independently of that of the higher Primates.

CHAPTER II.

Tarsiorp STAGE.

Turning now to that remarkable creature, Tarsius spectrum, the sole surviving
representative of a race widely distributed over the Northern Hemisphere in Eocene
times, but now confined to the East Indian Islands and the Philippines, let us see how
the known facts of its development help us in the elucidation of the problem we are
considering.

As is well known, our knowledge of the embryology of Tarsius rests on the monu-
mental labours of A. A. W. Husrecur. In a series of papers dating from 1896 he

* My friend, Professor Grossur, has been good enough to read the above criticism and authorizes
me to say that he concurs in its validity and that consequently he would no longer maintain the particular
explanation he put forward in his paper of how the simple Lemuroid placenta came to replace one of the
hamo-chorial type.
