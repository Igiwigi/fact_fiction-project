allowing any permeation through its substance, and without any such discontinuity

How far the electric charges on the vortex atoms, or their combination into molecules,
would negative such a hypothesis seems a difficult inquiry. But however that ma
be, a consensus of various grounds seems to require the zether to be stationary on t é
present theory. Thus if the motion of solids moved the surrounding ether, t
moving solids would act on each other with a hydrodynamic forcive, which would |
of large amount if we are compelled to assume a considerable density for the sth

Again, such a view would disturb the explanation, as above, of the fact that the
reive on a charged conductor in an electric field is a surface-traction equal at each
joint of the surface to the energy in the medium per unit volume. There is in any
ase nothing contradictory in the hypothesis of a stationary «ther ; if the fluid is not
lowed to stream through the circuits of the atoms, we have only to make the
ordinary supposition that the molecules are at distances from each other considerable
ompared with their linear dimensions, and it ean stream past between them.
77. Let us test a simple case of motion of a body through the ether, with respect
to the theory of radiation. Consider a horizontal slab of transparent non-radiating
material, down through which light passes in a vertical direction ; the equilibrium of
xchanges of radiation would be vitiated if the amount of light transmitted by the
Jab when in motion downwards with velocity v were different from the amount
ansmitted when it is at rest. Let V be the velocity of the light outside the slab,
