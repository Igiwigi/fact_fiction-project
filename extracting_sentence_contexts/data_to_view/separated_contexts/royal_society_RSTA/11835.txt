jy = 7°6759, pay = BATS, py = 184°3039,
Hence,
B, = ps"/pa® = 0267022,
By = pulp? = 3°12807. Thus 6 + 38, — 28, is positive, and accordingly no rational point-binomial is likely
to fit as well as the normal curve. As a matter of fact the fundamental cubic is now

176032) + 1:0453272* + *033773z — ‘0003709 = 0,

‘The two negative roots of this equation give imaginary value for p and g. The
small positive root gives p greater than unity and q negative, n is also negative. Although I can give no interpretation to these results, it seemed well to complete in
the latter case the solution and test how near the resulting point-binomial fitted the
curves.
