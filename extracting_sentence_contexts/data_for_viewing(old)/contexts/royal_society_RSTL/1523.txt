descend towards the centre of the earth, whilst the elongated
germen takes a precisely opposite direction ; and it has been
proved by Du Hamer * that if a seed, during its germination,
be frequently inverted, the points both of the radicle and
germen will return to the first direction. Some naturalists
have supposed these opposite effects to be produced by gra-
vitation ; and it is not difficult to conceive that the same agent,
by operating on bodies so differently organized as the radicle
and germen of plants are, may occasion the one to descend
and the other to ascend.

The hypothesis of these naturalists doesnot, however, appear
to have been much strengthed by any facts they were able
to adduce in support of it, nor much weakened by the argu-
ments of their opponents ; and therefore, as the phenomena
