No acceleration of the heart followed this action. Sinus stimulation has
been seen in the large majority of cases to retain its controlling effect until the heart
stopped beating spontaneously ; after this occurrence its stimulation, or frequently
Ghat of the vagus, provoked sequential contraction, lasting for a longer or shorter
Pme.

g It appears, then, that the slowing of aconine is not referable to a stimulation of
fihibitory apparatus within the heart, which is controlled by the vagus, but that it
gather limits the origination of motor impulses by acting upon some mechanism non-
Blentical with the vagal. The fact that atropine does not accelerate the heart slowed
by aconine makes it improbable that this mechanisin is that rendered active by

Stimulation of the sinus venosus.

g Aconine succeeded by Aconitine.
"2 If a dose of “008 to ‘015 gram of aconine is administered to a brainless frog with
posed heart, and about the time that entire failure of reflex takes place aconitine
“Bn dose slightly excessive of the certainly lethal amount is administered, the full
‘grain of aconitine symptoms does not follow. If the dose of aconine is relatively
Small, the heart accelerates under aconitine, and may even develop the rhythmic
‘ghurning movement so characteristic of the latter, but this phase passes, and the
oa quiets down to a slow steady rhythm with a fairly good ventricular systole. A larger proportionate dose of aconine may reduce this acceleration, and altogether
hinder incoordinate movements, the heart continuing to beat strongly and steadily.
“athe myocardium is not only strengthened in its systole, but the resistance to a
quence of the ventricle upon the auricle is increased by aconine, so that the dislo-
Zeation which aconitine induces, as well as the incoordination and ultimate failure of
Fthe systole, are to a certain extent limited or prevented.
