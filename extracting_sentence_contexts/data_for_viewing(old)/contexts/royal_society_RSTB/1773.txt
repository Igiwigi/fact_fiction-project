The agreement is thus so close, and extends to so many points, as to leave no
doubt that the Wititamson fragment and the actual cone belonged to the same
species, especially if we take into consideration their identical dimensions, and the
fact that they occur in the same deposit.

In all probability the fragment is the peduncle of a cone. â€˜This is suggested by the
exactness of the agreement in many points of structure and in dimensions, and espe-
cially by the fact that the leaf-bases of the fragment are so closely similar to the
sporophyli-bases of the cone. Most probably they were bracts, or sterile sporophylls,
rather than vegetative leaves.

An important fact remains which disposes of the only considerable difference in
structure between the two specimens, and also raises the probability that the
WiLLIAMSON fragment is a peduncle almost to a certainty.

The section through the base of the cone (Plate 3, photograph 15) shows the upper

part of the peduncle in connection with it. The wood of this part is shown in
tangential section, and is evidently secondary wood, the plane of section missing the
primary part. The tracheides agree in size and structure with those of the secondary
wood in the WitttAMson specimen, while the more central primary tracheides are
