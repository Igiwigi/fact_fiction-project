kept below 80 mm. of mercury. With this pressure the piston falls rapidly—so
rapidly, in fact, that a number of pistons were broken. The amount of the expansion in any experiment is measured by

v, _ the initial gas pressure _ B—7—s,
v, the final gas pressure B—a—s,

:

where B is the barometric pressure, 7 the saturated vapour pressure of the liquid at
the temperature of the experiment (7.e., initially), and s, the initial and s, the final
reading of the gauge P. The Expansion Chambers.
