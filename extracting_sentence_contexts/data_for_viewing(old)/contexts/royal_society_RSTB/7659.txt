pattern of the vessels.

Homologies can be recognized in the different animals by studying the following
features: the course of the vessels through bony foramina or the soft tissues, their relation-
ship to nerves and their areas of distribution. In this study, all these criteria have been used.
The trigeminal nerve and the bony foramina of the base of the skull are particularly useful
guides in that they indicate the course of the arteries supplying blood to specific regions
at a primitive stage. The foramen ovale is traversed in all the species studied by the
mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve, and the artery which accompanies this nerve,
although having a different name in some species, is a homologous vessel. This vessel,
which is known as the middle meningeal artery in the rabbit and in man, is the counterpart
of the vessel termed the ramus anastomoticus in the cat, dog, sheep, goat, pig and ox. The
homologous nature of these vessels is emphasized by the fact that in the cat, dog and pig
a middle meningeal artery is given off by the ramus anastomoticus, and this is sometimes
larger than the continuation of the ramus anastomoticus. Further, in the sheep, goat and
ox, the dura of the middle fossa is supplied by the ramus anastomoticus. The middle
meningeal artery also gives off a branch to the middle ear (the petrosal artery) which
accompanies the petrosal nerves. The ramus anastomoticus of the artiodactyls seems to
have been overlooked by Tandler (1899), and Lawrence & Rewell (1948) did not describe
this vessel in their account of the giraffe.
