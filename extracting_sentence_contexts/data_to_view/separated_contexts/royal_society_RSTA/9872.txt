This is the necessary condition for constant distribution
of illumination over the grating. That no conditions might be different for the two
exposures, the comparison spectrum was taken from the same metallic poles within
the cylinder.

4. As a fictitious displacement of the lines might also be caused by a change in
temperature of the grating (see Part I, p. 122), a careful watch was kept upon a
thermometer placed near it. For some weeks it was found impossible to take photo-
graphs on account of the fluctuations of the temperature, of which complete records
were kept, and, although one or two reliable photographs at low pressures were taken
at night towards the end of 1905, it was not until the Spring of 1906 that the
temperature of the room settled down sufficiently for long exposures to be made, a
