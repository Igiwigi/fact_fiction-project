The ratio of two

of these factorials of negative numbers is, however, finite, for it is easily shewn that
if m and n be two negative numbers, whether even or odd,

mii awe (—n —2)!! nll = De (—m— 2)u

n!! One of the advantages of a separate notation for what may be called the “ alternate”
or “double” factorial, is due to the fact that it often saves the inconvenience of
different expressions for odd and even numbers. $2. Formule of Transformation,

It is convenient to collect together some equations which will often be required.
