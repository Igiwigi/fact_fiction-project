zenith distance », though the law (73) has been seen to be insufficient to account
altogether for the observed changes. The necessary modification of (73) would seem
to be in the direction of a more rapid diminution of p (the conductivity) as w increases
from 0 degree to 90 degrees. This is probable on other grounds (§ 21), but the
theoretical discussion of its consequences would be a very laborious task.

The same modification would also increase the theoretical values of the seasonal
harmonies Q,”, which for the lunar diurnal magnetic variations were found to be
three or four times too small, relatively to the annual harmonics, when compared
with the observed data. But a more serious difficulty arises here. If we examine
the solar diurnal seasonal harmonics it is found that they are in fair agreement with
the theoretical values from (73), except in regard to phase. The seasonal harmonics
in the lunar variation are, in fact, nearly thrice as great compared with the annual
harmonies as in the solar variation. This is immediately evident in the initial data
of this paper (cf Tables TIT.(a@) and ILI. (y) with VI.(e) and VI.(d)), and the
following ratios of the solar and lunar seasonal harmonics E,”" show the same thing :—

These numbers are comparable with those of Table 8; the same preponderance in
the ratio for the diurnal harmonic is seen here, but the first three of these ratios are
less than half as great as those for B",,,.

If we suppose the electrical conductivity such that the seasonal harmonics due
