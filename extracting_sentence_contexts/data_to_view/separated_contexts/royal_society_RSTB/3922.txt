It is possible, therefore,
that these results are faulty. Similarly, the opposite results obtained in two consecutive years by HacEpoorn (38)
and Lozs, Kixe, and Moore (54), working at Pacifie Grove, Cal., may both be
correct. Our results at least emphasize the fact that it is necessary to repeat the
same experiments many times, and to extend them over a considerable number of
years, before a correct opinion in some cases can be formed. If our investigations at
Plymouth had been confined to the summer of 1912 alone, we should have arrived
at the same conclusion as Logs, Ktna, and Moore (54), that certain characters are
definitely dominant, namely, the posterior ciliated epaulettes and _ posterior
pedicellarize, while the green pigment is recessive. ON THE EXPERIMENTAL HYBRIDIZATION OF ECHINOIDS. 345
