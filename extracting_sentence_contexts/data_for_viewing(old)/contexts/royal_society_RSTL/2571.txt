1077. Returning to the phenomena in question, the first thought that arises in the
mind is, that the electricity circulates with something like momentum or inertia in

INDUCTIVE ACTION OF A CURRENT UPON ITSELF. 47

the wire, and that thus a long wire produces effects at the instant the current is
stopped, which a short wire cannot produce. Such an explanation is, however, at
once $et aside by the fact, that the same length of wire produces the effects in very
different degrees, according as it is simply extended, or made into a helix, or forms
the circuit of an electro-magnet (1069.). The experiments to be adduced (1089.)
will still more strikingly show that the idea of momentum cannot apply.

1078. The bright spark at the electromotor, and the shock in the arms, appeared
evidently to be due to one current in the long wire, divided into two parts by the
double channel afforded through the body and through the electromotor ; ; for that
the spark was evolved at the place of disjunetion with the electromotor, not by any
direct action of the latter, but by a force immediately exerted in the wire of commu-
nication, seemed to be without doubt (1070.). It followed, therefore, that by using
a better conductor in place of the human body, the whole of this extra current might
be made to pass at that place; and thus be separated from that which the electro-
