As it will be clear from what
follows, our formulation involves two manifolds, the matter manifold and space-time manifold. It is therefore not obvious on which manifold of the two one has to formulate the variational
principle. In fact, the Euler-Lagrange equations are the same regardless whether the variations
are performed on matter or space-time manifold. However, the Euler-Lagrange equations are
not the only equations we need in our theory. We also need the so-called integrability conditions
(2.7)2 and (2.25)2, which form the evolution equations for the principal fields of the theory,
which are the distortion field and the thermal impulse.
