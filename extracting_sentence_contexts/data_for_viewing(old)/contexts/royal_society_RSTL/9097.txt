young ones. On the other hand, the structure of their testaz shows them to be true
8eeds and not ovules. Unfortunately the nucleus has almost always disappeared ; and
where traces do remain we have as yet seen nothing beyond a cellular perisperm.
Further research may, however, reveal other examples in which traces of the peculiar
and characteristic endosperms of the Conifers and Cycads may be detected. It is very
desirable that all who are in a position fayourable to the prosecution of such researches
should keep this important possibility steadily in view.

Whilst thus avoiding all attempts definitely to associate these seeds with individual
plants, we must not overlook the fact that most of them have been obtained either from
the thin upper foot coal-seam of the Ganister beds, from which so many of the finest of
our Oldham plants have been derived, and that, consequently, we naturally look to
those plants to furnish the parent stems on which these seeds grew. But they fail
to show any structures with which the sceds can reasonably be associated. The only
stems which we yet possess that can with any degree of probability be identified with
the seeds are the Dadoxzylons. BRONGNIART thinks that the Neggerrathice may have been
the parents of some of them, especially of Cardiocarpon; but unless the Cordaites were
: Neggerrathie we find no trace of that group in the Oldham nodules; and, as already
remarked, our chief specimens of Dadoxylon have been derived from the marine beds of
the Ganister series and of Coalbrookdale, into which they had obviously been drifted,
and in which the seeds are extremely rare.
