S the magnetic force, and which is given by (48). Now B’ may be put into the form

% ingly, the magnetic term increases from grazing incidence to a maximum value and

2b then decreases to normal incidence.
‘Ss This result is in partial agreement with the third experiment, since it was found

3 that the magnetic effect attained a maximum value when 7 was equal to about 60°;
= but it disagrees, owing to the fact that the intensity depends on the square of the
2 magnetic force, and is, therefore, unaffected when the current is reversed.

g In the fourth experiment, the incident light was polarized perpendicularly to the
= plane of incidence, so that A = 0; and we see from (47) and (48) that the effects
= are of the same kind as when the incident light is polarized in the plane of incidence.
£ = This result altogether disagrees with the fourth experiment.

FE The theory which I have attempted to develop, cannot, I think, be considered

& results; at the same time the theory must be regarded as a somewhat tentative one,
