When two bodies are in contact the affinities commence
exercising their action before combination takes place.” M. Ds La Rivs, © The elec-
tricity of tension deyeloped by contact of heterogeneous bodies.” PFarapay, © That
the particles of the electrolyte are brought into a polarized state, and raised to a cer-
tain degree of tension, before discharge takes place :” but I am not aware that there
are any experimental facts to prove whether this tension in the voltaic battery, which
itself-is of an opposite character at each terminal, and, as we have seen, can be ex-
alted 80 as to produce discharges in the form of sparks for many weeks' constant du-
ration (16.), is due to the chemical constituents of the battery, or to mere contact of
dissimilar bodies, without reference to their chemical affinities. I was therefore most
anxious to see whether some experiment could not be devised, which would test the
action in a satisfactory manner, and for this purpose I availed myself of an extended
series of GRove's gas battery, described by him in a paper already alluded to (23.) *.
