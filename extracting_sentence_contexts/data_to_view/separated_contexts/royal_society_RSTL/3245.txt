58 MR. DARWIN ON THE PARALLEL ROADS OF GLEN ROY,

siderable elevations on both coasts of this kingdom, but I preferred the method I have
followed, because I believe it is equally legitimate, and of more general application,
although at first not so obvious. From these facts it is certain that there has been a change of leyel affecting within
recent times the whole central part of Scotland, and of a kind very similar to that
which has been the subject of 80 much attention in Sweden, where, according to
Mr. Lyell, remains of existing marine animals have been raised to the height of be-
tween 500 and 600 feet above the sea. The change of level in the case of Sweden is
as certainly known to be due to a slow movement of the land, and not of the water,
as it is on the coast of Chile, where a small tract is violently upraised during an
earthquake, the distant parts of the same coast being unmoved.
