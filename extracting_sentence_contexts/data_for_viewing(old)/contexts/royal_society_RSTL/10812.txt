386 MR. C. A. BELL ON THE SYMPATHETIC VIBRATIONS OF JETS.

In 1866 KuxpT* obtained musical tones by the impact of two flames, or of an air-
Jet against a flame. He considered it a desirable condition that the flame and jet
orifices should be of unequal size.

LeconTE in 1858, and BARRETT in 1867, discovered the now well-known © sensitive
flame,” which was investigated by Barrerr and TyNparr.t Tn order to detect
possible changes behind the orifice, which might account for the phenomenon, these
physicists mixed 8moke with the gas previous to ignition, No 8uch changes were
discovered ; but they were thus led to observe that jets of unignited gas and air
are also changed in form by sound, a fact strangely overlooked by Soxpaauss. The
changes occurring in such jets were found to be very similar to those induced by
ound in liquid jets. BaRRerTT and TyNDALL stated that an ignited jet of gag—a
flame--is sensitive to higher tones than an unignited jeb ab the same pressure, and
that the effective tones are higher the smaller the orifice. They attributed the
phenomenon to the resonance of the gas in the connecting tube.

In the course of these experiments it was noted that a sensitive flame sometimes
reproduces the tone by which it is affected.

About this time also, Tynparrt produced a new kind of * sensitive flame” by
blowing a jet of air through a gas flame : and observed that the ordinary blowpipe
flame could he brought into a sensitive condition. TYNDALL considered that the tones
