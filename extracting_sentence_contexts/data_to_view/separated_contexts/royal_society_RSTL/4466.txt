If, for example, the ratio of the loss of oxygen from the peroxide of barium to
that from the metallic oxide, be as 4 : 1, three parts of the peroxide of barium will have
been decomposed by the contact and one by the chemical action; if the ratio be as 2 : 1,
the decomposition will have taken place in equal proportions between the two. All
the phenomena are perfectly consistent with this view. As a fact, we know that the
contact, action proceeds far more rapidly at a bigh than at a low temperature ; we
need not therefore be surprised if the relative velocity of this to the chemical action
* I have made the experiment of heating the dry peroxide with oxide of zilyer until the latter was reduced,

but the 1oss of oxygen was only that of the silyer. It is however remarkable, that when it is heated in a similar

manner with chloride of silver, the chloride is reduced and the two equivalents of oxygen of the peroxide

evolved.
