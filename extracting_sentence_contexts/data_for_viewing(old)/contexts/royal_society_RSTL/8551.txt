F£quiseta bear to axes of their terminal fruit-spikes, and I find that their respective struc-
tures are typically identical. The transition from the stem to the fruit-axis produces no
Structural changes save such as are of the most trivial kind; the general type remains
unaltered and continuous. But to plant Calamostachys Binneyana upon the top of a
Calamite would be as abnormal as to surmount the stem of an Fquisetum with the
strobilus of a Lycopod.

Whilst expressing my conviction that Calamostachys is allied to the Asterophyllitean
plants, T cannot as yet correlate it with any particular stem. T have no evidence indi-
cating that it belonged to any of those described in the preceding pages, and suspect
that the plant of which it is the fruit has yet to be discovered. Diligent search must
continue to be made in the narrow vertical zone of beds within which the specimens
occur, until some absolutely demonstrative facts are obtained removing the obscurity
which till inyests this very remarkable and interesting fruit.

I have already referred briefly to one or two examples of fruiting axes of Asterophyllites
and Sphenophyllum in which circular scars, arranged in verticils at the nodes, marked
the points from whence strobili had been detached. Plate VII. fig. 44 represents a similar
stem, which I found amongst Captain Arxex's Brooksbottom specimens. 'The scars (7)
appear as if they were located below the node; but this appearance has, I think, merely
arisen from the circumstance that the strobili were detached before the plant was enclosed
in the $hale, thus allowing the bases of the bracts to be compressed against the stem ;
the carbonaceous matter having subsequently become detached revealed the cicatrices in
question®. Each cicatrix is nearly oval, but slightly narrower at its lower than at its
upper extremity, and with a distinct central depression marking the position of a vascular
