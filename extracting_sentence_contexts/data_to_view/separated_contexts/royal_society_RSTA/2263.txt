The purpose of this is to prevent any structure possessed by
the specimen, for example, the texture of fabries, from appearing in the field of view
and destroying the sensitivity of the match. For measurements on the spectrum, if
the slit of the monochromator is situated at the focus of the lens-window, an image
of the spectral line is formed at the observation pupil of the colorimeter and the test
field appears filled with light of the appropriate colour. Owing, however, to the fact
that the spectral light is concentrated within the limits of a narrow slit at the observer’s
eye, the appearance of the field is marred by streaks and other defects, due partly to

duced by non-homogeneity in the media of the eye itself. Such a system is, in fact,
of the type which one would arrange for the purpose of showing up such defects.
