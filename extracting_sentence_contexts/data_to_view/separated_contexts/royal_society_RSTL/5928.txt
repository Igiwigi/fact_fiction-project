Thus Q, is equal to the numbers dying in each year of age after the age =,
multiplied by the time (expressed in years and fractions of a year) that they have
respectively lived over that age; and if x=0, then Q,=43d, +144, +243d, .... (0+). when (az+2) becomes > w.

(11.) This column Q, represents, therefore, two distinct orders of facts: it represents
the sum of the number of years that will be lived after the age x by the 7, persons then

living, and . *, WS the mean after-lifetime ; of which DE will be enjoyed before the age
&+2 is attained, and Sits after the age z+2 is attained. time is = the unit here being one year of individual life.
