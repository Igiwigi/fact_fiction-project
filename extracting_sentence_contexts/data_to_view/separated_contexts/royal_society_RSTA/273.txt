The main lesson from his first short paper is that, the received
wisdom notwithstanding, decoherence can occur—in condensed matter physics as
well as in gravitational systems such as black holes—without energy loss. Unruh’s
[3] second short contribution to this Theme Issue concerns a special example of
‘false decoherence’, when a quantum system only ‘looks’ classical, or mixed, as a
result of a measurement process carried out too quickly. This fact has surprising
consequences, for example, in temperature measurements on an oscillator strongly
coupled to a heat bath. Turning to the experimental front, we touch upon control issues in quantum
optics and on tunnelling phenomena in mesoscopic physics. Milburn [4], an expert in quantum optics and control, discusses the importance
of decoherence for the classical control of quantum systems.
