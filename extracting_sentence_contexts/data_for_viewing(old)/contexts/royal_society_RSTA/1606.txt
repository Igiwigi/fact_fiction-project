of the nonlinearities near the origin; this is achieved by means of an eigenvalue comparison.

In order to illustrate the applicability of our theory, we discuss, merely as an example, the
solvability of the system of the following model problem:

uy (t) + Aafilt, ur (yO), ua(b), wh (0), 03 (0,13'()) =, te (0,1),

WP) = Aafalt ur (0, 04,120), 1 (0,03 (0,139), Fâ‚¬ (0,1),

uy (0) =0, 11 (1) = mila l(u1, u2)]
and (0) = no hoi [(u1, u2)], v5 (0) = up (1) = u5 (1) = 0,
where h1,h21 are non-negative, compact functionals defined on the space c![0,1] x C3[0, 1]. The
interest in (1.7) arises in the fact that it presents a coupling in the nonlinearities f, and f. and
in the BCs and allows the presence derivatives of different order in the various components.
The system (1.7) can be seen as a perturbation of the system (1.6) and is a generalization of
some earlier ones studied in [17,18]. Here we discuss in detail the existence and non-existence

of positive solutions of the system (1.7), illustrating how the constants that occur in our theory
can be computed or estimated. Our results are new and complement the ones in [1,4,15,16,19-21].

In this section, we study the existence and non-existence of solutions of the system of perturbed
