boundary, 7.e., of the anions, while the left-hand curve represents the simultaneous
progress of the blue boundary, i.e, of the cations. The gradual narrowing of the
figure enclosed by the right-hand and left-hand curves represents the colourless jelly
originally filling the whole tube, and becoming curtailed till it vanishes at the apex.
The curvature, which corresponds to diminishing velocity (and current), is seen to
depend on the nature of the salt used—to be most marked in the case of the best
conductor (KCl), and to nearly disappear in that of the worst (Li,SO,). Fig. 4
shows the regular result of increased concentration, which decreases the ionization («),
and therefore the values of the working velocities (U and V).

The displaced point at the apex of the half-normal KCl curve, already described,
is shown in fig. 3; and in fig. 4 it may be noticed that the later readings of the
yellow boundary were slightly inaccurate, this being due to the fact that the
experiment, which was a long one, had to be finished by gas light.

In conclusion, the author desires to express his great obligation to his colleague.
Professor T. R. Lyte, for much kindly suggestion and practical aid.
