Figure 12. Sketches of the system energy barriers for (a) dead pressure, Ep, and (6) rigid volume control, Ey. With po here
as the pressure acting on the unbuckled shell, is the difference in the unstable buckled state from that in the unbuckled state
between the elastic energy in the shell plus the potential energy of the loading. The calculated energy barriers in (c) are for
R/t = 100 and v = 0,3.

amplitudes greater than about one shell thickness, the measured buckling pressures are all about
20% of pc. These values are less than half the lower limits of the existing datasets for the sphere
(or the cylinder) at this R/t and similarly well below lower or Maxwell loads based on the perfect
spherical shell discussed above. That such low values are not present in the existing datasets is
almost certainly due to the fact that the shells with R/t as low as 100 do not have imperfections
as large as those deliberately manufactured into the shells tested by Lee et al. [6].

Non-axisymmetric bifurcation from the axisymmetric buckled state revealed in this paper is
qualitatively consistent with the multi-lobed dimples observed by Berke & Carlson [9] deep in
the post-buckled range. It is obvious from the discussion in §4 that the bifurcation analysis is only
a small beginning in the process of understanding the multiplicity of post-buckling solutions and
the intriguing shapes they produce.
