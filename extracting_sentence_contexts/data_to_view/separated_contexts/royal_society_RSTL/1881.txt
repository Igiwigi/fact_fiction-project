But I found numerous interfering dif-
ficulties. Thus, the water and solutions in the pieces of paper could not be pre-
vented from mingling at the point where they tonched. Again, sufficient acid
could be derived from the paper connected with the discharging train, or it
may be even from the air itself, under the influence of electric action, to
neutralize the alkali developed at the positive extremity of the decomposing
Solution, and $0 not merely prevent its appearance, but actually transfer it on
to the metal termination : and, in fact, when the paper points were not allowed
to touch there, and the machine was worked until alkali was evolved at the
delivering or positive end of the turmeric paper, containing the sulphate of
soda solution, it was merely necessary to place the opposite receiving point of
the paper connected with the discharging train, which had been moistened by
distilled water, upon the browned turmeric point and press them together, when
the alkaline effect immediately disappeared.

533. The experiment with sulphate of magnesia already described (495.) is
a case in point, however, and shows most- clearly.
