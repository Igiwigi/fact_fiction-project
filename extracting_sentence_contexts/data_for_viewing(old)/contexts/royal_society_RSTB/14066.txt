Extant orthopterans often exhibit aposematic coloration,
such as in warning-coloured lubber grasshoppers (Romalei-
dae), which cause emesis in lizard and bird predators,
gaudy grasshoppers (Pyrgomorphidae), which are capable
of ejecting distasteful chemicals, and dark-light-striped Cray-
ola katydids, which can produce glandular odorants (genus
Vestria Stal, 1874) [26,35-37]. Such aposematism can also be
found among orthopterans in early instars, demonstrating it
is an important element in the whole life history of orthopter-
ans [26,35]. However, compared with plant-like mimesis and
crypsis [25,38], aposematism rarely occurs among extant ensi-
ferans. In fact, plant-like mimesis is an ancient survival
strategy in preyâ€”predator interaction that dates back to the
Permian, while no aposematism has been reported in the
fossil record during the evolutionary history of ensiferans
[39-41]. The presence of aposematic coloration in Monitelcana
penalveri gen. et sp. nov., which is uniformly distributed
on the whole body irrespective of different organs, implies
that aposematic coloration was an important survival
strategy for ensiferans in the Cretaceous. Our find of an elca-
nid nymph from the Mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber also
suggests that, for the first time, orthopterans had evolved
aposematism by the Mid-Cretaceous.
