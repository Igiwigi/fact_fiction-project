The stellate shape,
bounded by ares, and prolonged where the cells are cut obliquely, is characteristic of the
junctions of a broken cellular mass. Comparison with fig. 16 (No. 393), which is part of a transverse section of the “ cortex
band,” shows the similarity in shape and disposition of the fibrous strands in the “ cortex
band.” ‘The concentric areas arise from the fracture of the “ cellules”’ of the cortex, and
the anastomoses of the strands correspond in shape and arrangement to the junctions
of the xylem cells. We have, in fact, a Dictyoxylon Bogen-struktur. The macro-
structure of the “cortex band” is therefore that of a fragmented Dictyoxylon cortex,
and the microstructure that of a heterogeneous periderm.
