occupy the Cambridge University Table at the Zoological Station for a period of six

S months, subsequently increased to nine. I here succeeded in obtaining a practically
‘, complete series of stages of Balanus perforatus, BRuGUTERE, as well as many stages
© in other members of the group.
2 Though a number of able observers have occupied themselves with the embryology
“H of Cirripedes, yet, owing to lack of opportunity, and to the difficulty of obtaining
S complete series of developmental stages, as well’ as to the inherent difficulties in the
& subject, much remained to be done in this line. Wstemors-Suum alone, with the
= advantages afforded by his position during the Challenger Expedition, has hitherto
& obtained a complete series of stages of any one form, but he failed to trace the
& history of the earlier stages, and in the later, limited himself to the appearance of
5 fresh and spirit specimens, as seen without cutting sections. In fact the method
& of sections has been little applied to the development of Cirripedes, and not at all to
‘8 the earlier stages. There is, therefore, little apology needed for an account embracing
Z the results obtained by the employment of some of the more modern methods of
> embryological study.
= My account of the development of Balanus perforatus differed in so many respects
= from that of previous observers on the same and other Cirripedia, that I was induced
= to compare the development in a number of forms, believing that the wide differences
& stated to exist must be due, at any rate in part, to actual differences in the develop-
@ ment of the different forms, such as occurs in other groups in which the ontogeny of
& allied species and genera have been compared. This expectation was, however, only
3 partially realised ; I found, on the contrary, a great uniformity in the development of
© the different forms, an agreement, in fact, so close that all might be conveniently
