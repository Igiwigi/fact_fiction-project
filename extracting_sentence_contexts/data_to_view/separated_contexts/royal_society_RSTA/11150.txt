On exposing the air to RÃ©ntgen rays, instead of ultra-violet light, the expansion
being the same as before (gauge reading = 183), very dense fogs were obtained in the
absence of electromotive force, while, when a difference of potential of 240 volts was
maintained between the metal and water surfaces, only a very slight fog appeared on
expansion. An expansion of the same amount, made 3 seconds after the rays were
cut off, gave a fog in the absence of any difference of potential, whereas, when the
potential difference amounted to 240 volts, no drops at all were produced, even when
the expansion was brought about 2 seconds after cutting off the rays. In fact, with
