tious individuals, the transmission probability for each type of
contact, and the duration of time an infectious person interacts
with other members of the community before becoming iso-
lated and removed from circulation. While some studies have
examined the ability of mathematical models to characterize
behaviour and its role in shaping disease dynamics (see Funk
et al. [89] for a review), disease modellers typically neglect
behavioural mechanisms in their models [90] due to difficulties
of tractability, measurement or expertise. Consider the Ebola
virus disease (EVD) epidemic of West Africa in 2014-2016.
In September 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion (CDC) forecasted 1.4 million cases of EVD in Liberia and
Sierra Leone by 20 January 2015 [91]. In fact, by 20 January
2015, there were fewer than 20000 confirmed and suspected
cases in Liberia and Sierra Leone [92]. Importantly, the forecast
assumed that no changes in individual behaviours and
community health decisions would take place. Hewlett &
Amola [93] present evidence that Ebola-affected communi-
ties, in fact, typically adopt protective measures that change
the outcome of epidemics. This disconnect between the epi-
demic modelling and the reality of how humans and their
institutions react to a changing infectious disease epidemic
illustrates the importance of incorporating behavioural
research into epidemic forecasting efforts.
