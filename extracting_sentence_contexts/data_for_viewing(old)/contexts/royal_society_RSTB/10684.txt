If experiments and models are not up to the task, where can we
turn? Some ecosystems researchers concluded that complexity,

as manifest in wicked problems, are best investigated and
understood using narratives, including diverse contend-
ing narratives [17,27,28]. The notion of using narratives to
understand EIDs (as differentiated from merely communi-
cating information pre-digested by experts) offers some
possibilities for working through the current global swamp
of contested facts, values and policies [17].

If narratives are such effective tools, why have EID
researchers not used them more often? There are several
reasons for this, having to do with both academic cultures
and the nature and framings of the issues being addressed.
The easiest answer for this oversight in the EID community is
that the disciplines most familiar with investigating complex
eco-social phenomena—political economy, anthropology, his-
tory, sociology, philosophy—are often dismissed as ‘soft’,
‘poor cousins’ to the natural and biomedical sciences. The
latter are considered ‘hard’ science; the so-called ‘soft’ disci-
plines also suffer from neglect because, compared to natural
