Results—The pressure results are collected in Table I., from which Plate 1 is
constructed. Plate 2 shows the pressures at the breech and at the base of the projec-
tile, their ratio, the mean pressure, the displacement and velocity of the projectile, and
a certain ‘“* energy factor ” as functions of the time. The mean pressure (P in Table I.)
is that which the cordite gases would have after adiabatic expansion, at uniform density,
to the volume which they actually occupy at time ¢. The work of expansion in these
circumstances will be equal, not to the kinetic energy of the projectile, but to a greater
kinetic energy corresponding to a fictitious mass M+«C, where
