The latter would have to be provided by the underlying theory. While the mean-field approximation is capable of illustrating these stability /metastability
features rather well, it does not establish convexity as is obvious from figure 3b. In fact, from
the definition of the effective action as a Legendre transform, convexity is a built-in property
of the effective potential, which is respected neither at the mean-field level nor in conventional
perturbation theory. It is thus a natural question as to whether the convexity property of the
potential has any decisive influence on the picture developed so far? As a powerful feature, the structure of the Wetterich equation (3.2) does establish convexity
of the potential for its global solutions [46].
