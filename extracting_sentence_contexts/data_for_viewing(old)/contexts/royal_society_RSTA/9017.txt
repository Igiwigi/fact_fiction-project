of maximum effect we should subtract one-third the radius of the nucleus in order
to get the true range. In this reasoning the nucleus is supposed to be small com-
pared with the size of the halo and sensibly spherical. Or we might expect at a
later stage that the band would be darkened uniformly. If we then find the mean
radius of this band the correction on this in order to determine the true range will be
half the nuclear radius.

But in point of fact such borders have not been definitely identified. The sharp
definition of the outer margin sometimes shown by a well darkened halo may be
referable to such an effect of the nucleus. But the radius of the nucleus, in such
haloes as are of importance to us, amounts to only 3 to 5 per cent. of the halo-radius.
It seems more practical, therefore, to consider generally how much of this 3 or 5 per
cent. might be deducted in order to obtain the true halo-radius or range which we
seek to measure. Now we may take it that in developing haloes those radioactive
particles which are placed on the outer surface of the nucleus will not sensibly affect
the mica and we must make some assumption as to the depth in the nucleus from
which those rays proceed which give us a visible effect, that is, which define that
part of the boundary of the halo to which we bring the lines of the micrometer. I
take this depth as one-third the radius inward from the surface of the nucleus. If
not quite accurate this assumption must at least reduce such error as must arise if we
