There are several objections to this process, all of which
seem to have considerable weight. In the preceding pages I
have shown, that the juice of apples, whether ripe or unripe,
always contains two acids of very different properties. By
the above process these acids are not separated; they are in
fact found in what is supposed to be the resulting pure malic
acid. and it is impossible, without the most complicated pro-
cesses, to obtain this substance in the insulated form. The precipitation of the lead by means of sulphuric acid,
appears to be objectionable.
