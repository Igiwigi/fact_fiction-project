Kirk McDonald provides an excellent discussion of electromagnetic momentum and
velocity in a DC circuit [8]. Hertzâ€™s experiments dealt with standing waves in which the fields propagate back and forth
at the speed of light, but the average energy velocity is zero. The fact that electromagnetic energy
velocity may, in general, be less than c appears to have first been explicitly noted by Harry
Bateman (1882-1946) in 1915 [9]. Recently, Gerald Kaiser re-examined this question, interpreting
energy velocity as a local time-dependent characteristic of electromagnetic fields [10]. Clearly, the ratio of electric to magnetic energy relates to energy velocity.
