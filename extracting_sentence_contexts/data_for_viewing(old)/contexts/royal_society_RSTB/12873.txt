actions as ritualistic (which is of course hard to say), then
they may be on the brink of also understanding human
rituals when these are directed towards them.

Our largely negative finding regarding ape ritual could
suffer from false negatives (as any finding), and so we do
not consider the case closed yet. Another way to phrase the
question is to ask what kind of rituals (should they exist)
would we expect apes to have? Our answer to this was that
we would expect these ape rituals to involve symbolic mean-
ingful results. This proposal stems from the fact that apes
seem to frequently express their ability to match results (see
above), and from the fact that their potential for symbolic,
causally- and goal-opaque results remains currently relatively
untested. Future studies should therefore focus on testing ape
symbolic abilities in the results domain. It might be possible
that apes may be naturally susceptible to at least understand
symbols when the symbol involves object changes, rather
than fixed object states. It could also be tested whether
specific results (but also actions) can produce symbolic mean-
ing for apes. For example, what would happen if a study like
Clay & Tennie ([26], actions on objects) would involve var-
ious extraordinary actions and/or results differentially
applied to several objectsâ€”where the apes would have to
merely later choose between objects (i.e. similar to the human
