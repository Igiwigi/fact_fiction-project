he distinguishes very well the dark part of the moon, illu-
minated by a faint light, while she is young, which completes
her circle. The other person, THomas STRETTON, is a young
man of s0briety and steadiness, and long sighted also. I par-
ticularly mention these circumstances, to obviate an objection
that has been made to these accounts, from the cireumstance
of the bright star in the south eye of the bull, called Aldebaran,
having passed by the moon the same evening, and been
eclipsed by the northern part of her disk. I own it is a singu-
lar coincidence of circumstances, that Aldebaran should the
same evening pass behind the moon, in nearly the same track
in which this star-like appearance was observed upon the dark
part of the moon's disc : but the two facts, considered as inde-
pendent of each other, are not incompatible. The appulse of
Aldebaran to, and subsequent occultation by the moon's disc,
was predicted in the nautical almanac, and observed by many.
