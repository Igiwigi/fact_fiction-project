The increase in their size is produced partly by the confluence of pre-
viously detached individuals, and still more generally by the addition of new layers
of calcareous matter round their exteriors. Indeed the latter process has apparently
been the direct cause of the former condition. In fig. 10, three such layers are represented as they appear in the inverted scale :
10a is one of the lower series; þ is a layer of larger granules, some of which (6')
have become confluent ; and at c we observe a faint indication of a still higher series,
which when brought into view are found to have coalesced, forming in fact the inferior
surface of the middle tissue of the scale. This representation also shows, what T have
already alluded to, that whilst all the granules composing one layer exhibit a uniform
tendency to arrange themselves in one direction, those of different layers cross each
other more or less diagonally. Bearing in mind the arrangement of the primary fibres
of which these lamina? of membrane consist, it seems probable that the direction
of these fibres influences that of the calcareous granules.
