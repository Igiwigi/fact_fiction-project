If it were asserted that chlorine contained azote, oxygen, and
this unknown body, then it might be aid, that, in the action
of hydrogen on chlorine, the azote, the oxygen and the chlo-
rine, having all attractions for hydrogen, enter into union with
it, and form a quadruple compound.

Professor BEerZzELivs has lately adduced some arguments,
which he conceives are in favour of chlorine being a compound
of oxygen from the laws of definite proportions ; but I cannot
regard these arguments of my learned and ingenious friend
as possessing any weight. By transferring the definite pro-
portions of oxygen to the metals, which he has given to chlo-
rine, the explanation becomes a simple expression of facts ;
and there is no general canon with respect to the multiples
of the proportions in which different bodies combine. Thus
azote follows peculiar laws in combining with every different
body; it combines with three volumes of hydrogen, with half
a volume of oxygen, with 1.2 and 1Â£ of the same body, and
with four volumes of chlorine.

The chemists in the middle of the last century had an idea,
that all inflammable bodies contained phlogiston or hydrogen.
It was the glory of Lavorsier to lay the foundations for a
sound logic in chemistry, by shewing that the existence of
