Conidial production was not affected by salinization. This
was surprising considering the generally high sensitivity of
fungal reproductive output to stressors [48-50], including salt

>>> 5 [22,29,30]. Here, it seems that the total sporulation rate variabil-
giggid ity was most probably related to species identity and origin: in
microcosms inoculated with individual strains, FLCU had the
highest sporulation rate. The halotolerance and high sporulat-
ing capacity of FLCU-R, in reference to salt-rich media (up to
8 gl), were previously reported by Canhoto et al. [22]. Over-
all, S strains tended to release more conidia than R strains,
-ie - singly or in mixtures. In fact, a general tendency to produce
inf x ny more spores paralleled a (non-significant) reduction in biomass
Ao + in most S strains in the salinized (versus reference) media treat-
ARTE ment. If confirmed, this might indicate that in salt-rich

environments, these strains tend to guarantee reproduction

and dispersal rather than mycelial growth. This contrasts with

the growth versus reproduction trade-off previously found in
â€œwee R species grown in NaCl-rich medium [22].
