Figure 3. Research plan to identify native white-footed mouse antibodies conferring protection against pathogens carried by deer ticks or against deer ticks them-
selves, if tick feeding is in fact antibody-mediated (more testing is required to understand the mechanisms that confer resistance to tick feeding). Antibodies will be
encoded in the germline via CRISPR to confer heritable resistance, and ecological effects tested by introducing engineered mice onto one or more sparsely inhabited
islands prior to decisions by the communities of Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard. (Online version in colour.)
