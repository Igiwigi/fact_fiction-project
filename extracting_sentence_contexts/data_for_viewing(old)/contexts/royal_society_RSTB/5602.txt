torium. In most preparations, the cells are large, triangular or polymorphous.

The septum or paraterminal body contains two nuclei—the nucleus septi medialis and
the nucleus septi lateralis. These two nuclei are quite distinct in Platypus. They can
be easily delimited and correspond to the two parolfactory nuclei described by CrosBy
(1917) in the alligator and by Hives (1923) in Sphenodon. The nucleus septi medialis
(n.s.m., figs. 28 and 29) is found in the ventro-medial part of the septum, separated from
the nucleus accumbens by a small bundle of fibres and medial to the medial limit of the
tuberculum olfactorium. The cells are smaller than those of the nucleus septi lateralis
(n.s.l., figs. 28 and 29). ‘This latter nucleus lies in the dorso-lateral region of the septum,
ventral to the hippocampus and dorsal to the septal portion of the nucleus accumbens.
The cells are larger than those of the medial septal nucleus but not as large as those of
thenucleusaccumbens. The fact that the lateral nucleus is the origin for a portion of the
medial forebrain bundle suggests a plausible reason for its cells being larger than those
of the medial nucleus.

The nucleus preopticus (n.p.o., figs. 37 and 38) is made up of several rows of cells
surrounding the ventral part of the third ventricle about two millimeters cephalward of
the optic chiasma. There is no definite arrangement of the small round and slightly
elliptical-shaped cells.
