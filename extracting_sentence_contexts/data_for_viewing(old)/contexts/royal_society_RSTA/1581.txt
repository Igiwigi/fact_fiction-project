future generations of scientists.

The sharing of data and resources has the immense advantage of enabling other researchers
to reproduce the results or even recreate entire experiments. Hence, it picks up on a currently
widely discussed debate: the reproduction crisis and the associated loss of society in scientific
work. On top of open-source, ‘frugal science’ aims to make scientific instruments available at
low to no costs. The core idea is to replace complex and usually expensive laboratory-grade
devices with do-it-yourself or consumer-grade solutions. Wang et al. [122] succeeded in this
in the manuscript ‘UCsim2: 2D Structured Illumination Microscopy using UC2’, in which the
open-source three-dimensionally printed optics kit ‘UC2’ (You.See.Too.) is extended by super-
resolution functionality using SIM and image scanning microscopy (ISM). The open-source
documentation allows others to build a device themselves, e.g. for teaching purposes. A device
that costs only 5000€ instead of one million also contributes to the fact that several experiments
are carried out in many more places in the world (figure 1d). This allows laboratories in financially
less well-equipped institutes to keep up with cutting-edge science and contribute to scientific
progress. This approach also demonstrates the beauty of open-sourcing ideas.

In addition to the possibility of providing other scientists with the tools necessary for research
to increase the reproducibility of scientific results, corresponding quality standards are of great
importance for carrying out the experiments. Several initiatives such as the QUAREP-LiMi
[126,127] recently proposed guidelines for good practice in (light) microscopic imaging and


sample preparation. The standards developed together with the scientific community promise
increased reproducibility across laboratories.
