Numerical illustrations of these notions might be made
without difficulty, and they might be applied to all cases of
chemical action ; but in the present state of the enquiry, a
great extension of this hypothetical part of the subject would
be premature.

The general idea will, however, afford an easy explanation
of the influence of affinity by the masses of the acting sub-
stances, as elucidated by the experiments of M. BERTHOLLET ;
for the combined effect of many particles possessing a feeble
electrical energy, may be conceived equal or even superior to
the effect of a few particles possessing a strong electrical
energy : and the facts mentioned, page 25, confirm the sup-
position : for concentrated alkaline lixivia resist the transmis-
son of acids by electricity much more powerfully than weak
ones.

Allowing combination to depend upon the balance of the
natural electrical energies of bodies, it is easy to conceive that
