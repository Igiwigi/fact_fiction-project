The more accurately
a character can be defined the more objective the measurements of it are likely to be. In this sense the measurements of, say, the length of the test of an echinoid are less
objective than the measurements of the length of the metal rod, since in the first case it

is more difficult the define the exact limits between which the measurements are being
made. If the secular error forms too large a part of the total observational error, there is
always a danger that the means of comparable measurements on two samples may differ
significantly, although this difference, in fact, is due mainly to the slowly fluctuating
idiosyncrasies of the observer. If, however, the effect of the latter is swamped by the
random accidental errors, spurious differences of this sort, due simply to the slowly
fluctuating secular error, will not be liable to occur. The measurements can then be said
to be reproducible.
