aggregated load of more and more lines. Given there is no systematic synchronization between
broadband users, they will in general reach their maximum usage rate at different, largely
uncorrelated times (figure 4). As a result, statistical gains become more and more significant
as more lines come together over the broadband infrastructure. With just 10 lines (N = 10), it
is enough to dimension the interface for a normalized peak utilization per line of the order of 16.
As the number of aggregated users increases, the normalized peak utilization settles just above 2,
converging towards the peak : mean ratio of the usage profile shown in figure 1 (figure 5b).

Figure 5b gives the peak: mean ratio R(N), while figure 6 gives the multiplex gain G(N) =
R(1)/R(N). If there was no multiplexing gain, we would need to dimension core nodes such
that they can carry the load resulting from all the lines peaking at the same time to the level
of the most demanding of any of them. So for N lines, we would need a capacity of the order of
N*R(1) with R(1) ~ 130 (from figure 5a). In actual fact, we only need to dimension those nodes
to N*R(N). So the multiplexing gain is of the order of G(N) = [N*R(N)]/[N*R(1)] = R(1)/R(N). As
shown in figure 6, if statistical multiplexing did not occur, network interfaces in the core of the
network would have to be 50-60 times bigger than they need to be in practice. Of course, statistical
multiplexing requires large-scale use of IP router technology, which introduces another layer of
cost and complexity in the network.

At any point in time, it is very unlikely that the load on an access line will be anywhere near
its capacity. On a typical Sunday evening about 1% of fibre lines may have a load in excess of
