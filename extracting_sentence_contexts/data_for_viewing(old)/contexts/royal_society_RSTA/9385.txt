of orientation is then found to be exhibited only by lubricants, the ends of whose
molecules are unlike such as long chain acids which have at one end the carboxyl
group —COOH and at the other the group —CH, (VII).

Normal paraffins whose molecules end for end are symmetrical show no such latent
period. This is sufficient evidence that the molecules are oriented. It is also sufficient
evidence that the molecules are oriented with the long axis at right angles to the face
for, if the molecules were flat on the face, there would be no reason for the long latent
period of orientation of molecules of acids or alcohols, sixty minutes and forty minutes
respectively, and the insensible latent period of paraffins.

Each molecule of lubricant in a primary film exerts its influence independently of
the others. This follows from the fact that the friction varies directly with the density
of the vapour of the lubricant when the primary films on the surface are deposited
from vapour (IV, 556).

The properties of primary films are easily studied by the use of a spherical slider,
and the fact that the friction is the same when such a slider stands in a large pool of
lubricant as it is when the faces of slider and plate are covered only by an insensible
primary film deposited from saturated vapour proves that the molecular configuration
of such films is the same in both cases (see especially IV, 554, and VII, 28).
