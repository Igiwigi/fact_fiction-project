Consider an N-person game where all the agents
have the same strategy space X. We assume that the cost of player i, depends on her type 6; € On,
her strategy x; and is symmetric with respect to the other players strategies x_;:

IN (xin x1) =F Gi, Xie Xi) =F Gi, Xir (Xo) for every o € SN-1,

where Sy-1 denotes the set of permutations of {1,...,N} \ {i}. We moreover assume that there is
a modulus of continuity w such that for every for every N, every (6, 6)) € On x On, every (xj,x_i)
and (yj, y_j) in Xone has

WN (6:1, x1) — IN GrViry-i)| < (do 6;,6))) + o(dx(xi,¥i))

For further reference, let us observe, following [13], that the W; distance above is nothing but the
quotient (by permutations) distance

As in [13, theorem 2.1], under (4.1), one can extend JN to @ x X x P(X) by the classical Mc Shane
construction, i.e. by defining for every (0,x,v)€@ x X x P(X), the cost FN(6,x,v) by the formula

The previous assumptions are therefore equivalent to the fact that player is cost is given by

with FN a sequence of uniformly equicontinuous functions on @ x X x P(X). Theorem 4.1 (Pure Nash equilibria converge to Cournot-Nash equilibria). Let xN =
