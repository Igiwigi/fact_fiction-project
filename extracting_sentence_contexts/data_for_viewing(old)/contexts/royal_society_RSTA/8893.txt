Throughout this thickness of 700 feet, it is practically certain that there is no rock
that can give rise to distinct magnetic disturbances.

As to what rocks come immediately beneath the Lower Lias clays our information is
not so definite, for, unfortunately, there is no deep boring in the immediate vicinity of

Trthlingborough. The nearest deep boring in fact is at Orton,* about 15 miles
N.N.W. of Irthlingborough. There the Lower Lias was about 620 feet thick, and its
base was reached at —292 O.D., below which were 49 feet of Rheetic and other beds
down to —341 O.D. Then came an igneous rock which was pierced to a depth of
74 feet before the boring was abandoned. This rock compared closely, according to
Prof. Bonney,t with the porphyroids or altered andesites (dacites) of High Sharpley,
Charnwood Forest. The buried Charnian Ridge of Pre-Cambrian rocks therefore
rises at Orton to within 341 feet of O.D. The ridge probably trends south-eastward,
that is towards Irthlingborough, following the usual Charnian strike, N.W. to 8.E.,
but whether its depth beneath the surface remains constant in that direction remains
unknown, as the Paleozoic floor has not been reached for a considerable distance
either east or south-east from Orton.}
