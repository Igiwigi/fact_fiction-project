description. She says (p. 218), “ But unlike the findings of both Scuepman (1918),
for Echidna, and Sroxes (1912), for the opossum, the fibres of the corpus trapezoideum
pass medial and dorsal to the sensory nucleus of the trigeminus rather than lateral and ventral
to it.’ (My italics.) Clearly she is describing the intermediate decussation of
HE p and not the corpus trapezoideum, for this always passes lateral and ventral to
the descending fifth root. Some Ornithorhynchus sections which I have examined
confirm that there is no corpus trapezoideum, and that the auditory decussations
resemble those in the Sauropsida where there is likewise no corpus trapezoideum.


CEREBELLUM OF ECHIDNA ACULEATA 29

This is to be expected in view of the fact that the labyrinth in Ornithorhynchus shows
little or no advance upon that of reptiles and birds. In the Sauropsida the chief
auditory crossing is the intermediate decussation of HELD, as can be seen in the papers
by Scnepman (1918), Kappers (1921), WinKLER (1918), and Huser and Crossy
(1926). Hep (1893) demonstrated that it myelinates at an earlier stage than the
others and is to be regarded as phylogenetically older. Sroxes (1911) and Fuse
(1926, c) have shown that in marsupials, although the corpus trapezoideum is
massive, the intermediate decussation still conveys a large number of cochlear fibres.

The intermediate decussation is, then, the most primitive of the auditory crossings.
It is practically the sole method of decussation in the Sauropsida and in Ornithorhynchus,
and in Echidna still conveys the greatest number of fibres. In higher mammals it
increases in size but is rapidly surpassed by the corpus trapezoideum.
