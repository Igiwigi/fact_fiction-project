L. G. curye is
practically coincident with the theoretic curve, and it retains a measurable though slight
inferiority of pressure even up to the muzzle of the gun. These differences are without doubt due to the fact that with the R. L. G. powder,
at least under ordinary circumstances, the whole or a large proportion of the charge
is consumed before the projectile is greatly removed from the seat of the shot.
