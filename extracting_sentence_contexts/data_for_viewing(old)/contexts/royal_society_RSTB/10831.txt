Xinjiang region of China [22], people of Jewish descent [23],
some native American populations [24,25] and the Buryat
population in southern Siberia [26].

(a) Geographical distribution

Compared with other human herpesviruses, which, with the
exception of HSV-2, characteristically infect the majority of
healthy individuals in most geographical regions, KSHV

Given this coevolution of KSHV with human populations,
the fact that it is today infrequent in many geographical areas
still awaits a satisfactory explanation. Suggestions include host
genetic polymorphisms that contribute to the maintenance of
KSHV in endemic populations. In support of this possibility,
the existence of a recessive gene on chromosome 3p22 predispos-

(b) Transmission ing to KSHV infection in childhood in an endemic population
In the general population, KSHV appears to be transmitted has been predicted [65,66]. Environmental factors such as
mainly during childhood, with saliva being considered the plant chemicals that promote the reactivation of KSHV in
most important vehicle of transmission [27-31]. Several infected individuals and thereby the spread in the community
studies show that KSHV can be transmitted within families, have also been invoked [67]. In addition, there is now increasing
from mother to child as well as among siblings [30,32-35]. evidence that KSHV transmission in childhood in Africa is
