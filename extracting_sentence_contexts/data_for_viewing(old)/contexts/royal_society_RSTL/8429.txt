& 136. Mr. Davip Fours (* Chemical News for October 1868) has noticed, though not
© In any detail, the general unreliability of Biscnopy's results. He, however, endeayours to
S -8ubstitute for these deductions of his own from experiments still more fallacious, in
S gupport of his notion that the acid or basic silicates of which our earth's rocks consist
a scarcely contract at all in passing from the liquid to the solid state.

137. His facts are derived from the supposed dimensions of fused Rowley Rag stone
(baxalt) in the liquid state, and when again solidified after having been cast into moulds at
Messrs. Cxaxc's glass-works to form thin patent artificial stone, and from melted slags
cast by himself into cast-iron ingot moulds of moderate capacity.

As regards the first, the moulds into which the fused rock was cast were formed of
what founders call © dry sand,” 7. e. loamy sand, in which the impression of a wood
< pattern” or model is made, the moulds being then dried and heated to something like
a red heat, at which temperature the liguid rock is poured into them to fill the cavity,
