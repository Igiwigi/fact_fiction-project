But subjective forces can never take the place
of objective ones. Conscious man himself is powerless to direct his movements without
reference to external features. There is no choice, therefore, but to examine more closely the possibilities of orientation
by means of external features; and, in fact, a number of directed reactions to external
features are known in locust hoppers, or adults, or both. Williams (1930, 1949) has set aside
every reaction to external stimuli—except one—that has been suggested, or even demon-
strated to be concerned in the orientation of flying insects, on the grounds that none of
these external stimuli is constant enough to keep a migrant on a straight course over long
distances. The exception was the earth’s magnetic field, the possible orienting action of
which was investigated experimentally on locust hoppers by Cockbill (1942).
