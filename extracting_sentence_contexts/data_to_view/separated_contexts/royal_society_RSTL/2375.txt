I have
there, however, entered no further into the nature of death than was necessary for the
purpose I then had in view. I am now about to compare the results of these experi-
ments with those of others, made since the publication of that treatise, with a view,
as far as experiment, can apply to it, of explaining the nature of death. It appears to me that the various facts ascertained in the course of the inquiries in
which I have been 80 long engaged, throw light on this subject. I shall, as I proceed,
refer to the passages, either in my papers in the Philosophical 'Transactions or my
Inquiry into the Laws of the Vital Functions, where the proofs of the different posi-
tions I shall have occasion to state, will be found. In the last of the papers above referred to, I had occasion to observe, that there is
no question relating to the animal economy which involves a more general view of its
phenomena than the nature of sleep.
