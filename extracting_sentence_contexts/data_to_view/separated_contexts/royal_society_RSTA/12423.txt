The correction is for a greater variation of distance
and of inclination from the equatorial plane than can have been met with —*00030
~ of the whole, and this correction is accordingly applied in the one experiment (9) in
§ which the cylinders were employed.
© TLhave not at present referred to the attractions between the suspending wires and
the gold balls, and between the suspending quartz fibres and the lead balls. The
a attractions of the fibres and wires for one another are, of course, infinitesimal to the
‘S second degree. Calculation shows that in experiments 4 to 8 and 10 to 12, the
& attraction of the lead balls for the fibres is to their attraction for the gold balls as
8 1 is to 204,500, and in the same direction, while the attraction of the gold balls
cs for the wires is to their attraction for the lead balls as 1 is to 115,000, and in the
£& opposite direction, The reversal of the direction is surprising, but it is due to the
2 fact that the most effective part of the fibres is absent in the case of the wires, owing
= to the large diameter of the lead balls, and, therefore, the action of the long wire on
& the upper gold ball, which is on the other side, is the preponderating tifieteacas The
é difference of these two corrections is gg#yyo of the main effect, and in the opposite
3 direction. I should add, that though the absolute masses of the small balls are known
: with an accuracy of 1 in 10,000, this is in no way necessary, So long as they are
practically alike, it does not matter whether their mass is known or not, as it is
ultimately eliminated. I have, however, introduced into the numerical work the
actual masses in order to obtain the constants of the fibres and of the mirror, and the
viscosity of the air absolutely.
