]. Introduction

Quantum theory is unsurpassed as a description of the
data produced by many very different experiments in
(sub)-atomic, molecular and condensed matter physics,
quantum optics, etc. A large body of work focuses on
different interpretations of the quantum formalism [1-8]
and its derivations from different sets of axioms [9-20]
but offers no explanation of the success of quantum
