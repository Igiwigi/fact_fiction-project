The expangion of this determinant gives evidently a result of the form U,+U,S'=0,
where U, represents a function of the second degree, and U, a function of the first degree
in the variables ; and clearing off radicals we get U3—UjS=0; and this is the equation of
a surface of the fourth degree, having the conic of intersection of U, and U, as a double
line. Hence the proposition is proved.

26. The quantities x, y, 2, w of the last article are evidently proportional to the tetra-
hedral coordinates of the point «, 3, y, 3, referred to the tetrahedron whose vertices are
the poles of the planes A, B, C, D of the quadrics S—A?, S—B?, S—=C?, S—TY, 80 that
the equation of condition in #, y, 2, w is only the equation of the surface F referred to
this tetrahedron. Hence the method of generation of surfaces of the fourth degree
having a conic for a nodal line is exactly the same as the method of generating cyclides
given in art. 5; and in fact the two surfaces are identical, since the cyclide has the
imaginary circle at infinity for a nodal line, s0 that by linear transformation we could
get one surface from the other; and to eyery property of a cyclide there is a corresponding
property of the more general surface here considered: but I thought that it would be
useful to show that their equations, the equations of the surface cutting them ortho-
gonally &c., are identical in form; 80 that for every theorem which I shall prove to hold
for a cyclide the reader may if he chooses put in the more general surface here con-
8idered#.

#* [Professor Carrey has remarked to me that, instead of the method of Chapter IT., the immediate general-
ization would be to consider, instead of spheres, quadric surfaces of the form $+LM, S+LN, &e., and that it is
a further generalization, or rather an extension, of S—A?, S—B?, &e, Professor CarLey remarks that itis a pity
to omit tho intermediate step. Before Professor Carry had drawn my attention to it, the intermediate step had
