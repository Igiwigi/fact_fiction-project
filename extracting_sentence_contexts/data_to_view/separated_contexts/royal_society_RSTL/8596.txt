The embryo is also
remarkable for the distinctness with which it exhibits the condition of the alimentary
canal with its two central lobes or gastric chambers, and fore and aft the pharynx and
the rectal peduncle. Though the foot is developed to 80 slight an extent in this specimen and the body-
walls generally were 80 thin and transparent as to suggest some abnormality of deve-
lopment, yet at the point marked F in the figure, glow moyements of contraction and
expansion were going on. From this phase onward, in fact, the foot exhibits muscular
movements. Plate 3. figs. 34, 35, 36 go together, giving different views of three embryos of very
nearly the same stage of developmentâ€”that is to say, a little in advance of the embryo
of fig. 31. The foot has now grown out as a yery prominent conical mass, and being
covered with vibratile cilia and capable of considerable alteration of form, becomes the
chief locomotive organ, The embryos in this condition move about freely in the brood-
pouch, and feed on the material supplied to them from its walls.
