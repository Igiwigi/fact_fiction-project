30 DR. CG. A. MacMUNN ON THE GASTRIC GLAND

while the round deposits get larger and larger, and so on. The same remark applies
to those curious deposits of pigment in Leypre’s “vesicular” connective tissue in the
oyster, as referred to above. If we were to assume that the entero-chlorophyll is present as a chromogen, perhaps
formed by the action of a ferment on the gut-chlorophyll, we could meet the diffi-
culties of the case, but we have at present no facts to support any such assumption. However, I am sure we are safe in assuming that this pigment arrives at the
gastric gland through the instrumentality of fatty matters, and it is deposited in the
gland with other reserve products, and is finally, in part at least, excreted with the
feeces. Whether or not it gives rise to the formation of other pigments, we cannot
at present say.
