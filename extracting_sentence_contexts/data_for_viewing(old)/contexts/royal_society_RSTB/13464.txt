Jeffrey Lees 1. Introduction

e-mail: jeffrey.m.lees@gmall.com Concerns about political polarization and its negative effects on democracy and

intergroup relations have increased among scholars, policy makers and the
public alike over the past few years [1-4]. Yet despite this attention to polariz-
ation as a major contributor to modern political ills, a growing body of scientific
work on ‘false polarization’ has simultaneously flourished, suggesting that the
extent of polarization is largely a fiction of our minds [5-8].

So are we actually quite polarized or do we just think we are? The answer,
ultimately, is it depends. Of course, there is a temptation when we think about
polarization and its negative consequences to champion interpartisan harmony,
but a well-functioning democracy requires disagreement and debate. Thus, our
aim is to promote belief accuracy regarding the true levels of polarization and
the true attitudes of outgroups. However, before we get to that we need to dis-
entangle the myriad phenomena that are labelled ‘polarization’ and understand
their psychological roots.

Here, we argue that integrating the psychology of meta-cognition—beliefs
about what other people believe—will help us better understand polarization.
