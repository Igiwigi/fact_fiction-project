Further, the history of agriculture so far as it is known, indicates that soils under
cultivation without supplies by manure from external sources, do, as a matter of
fact, gradually become less fertile. This, as a rule, will take place more rapidly
in undulating or high forest lands, than in the natural grass or prairie lands of
the plains.

Again, if we compare the amount of nitrogen in the surface soil of permanent grass
land, with that of adjoining land of the same original character, but which has for
some time been under arable culture, we find that the latter is much poorer in
nitrogen. In illustration, it may be stated that whilst the surface soil of the grass
land at Rothamsted contains from 0째25 to 0째30 per cent. of nitrogen, that of the
corresponding arable land only contains from 0째1 to 0째15 per cent. The arable soil
has, in fact, originally been covered with natural vegetation of some kind, with
comparatively little removal, and consequent accumulation ; whilst, under arable
culture, much of the accumulated nitrogen has been used up, and the loss has not
been compensated by free nitrogen brought into combination, under the influence
either of electricity, or of organisms within the soil. Whether or not there is any
restoration of the kind supposed, we believe that a consideration of the origin of soils
generally, and of the history of agriculture in different countries, will lead to the
conclusion that the losses of combined nitrogen by cropping, and in other ways, are
not compensated by corresponding amounts of free nitrogen constantly brought into
combination.

The Rothamsted field experiments have indeed now been continued long enough to
afford some pertinent examples bearing upon this subject.
