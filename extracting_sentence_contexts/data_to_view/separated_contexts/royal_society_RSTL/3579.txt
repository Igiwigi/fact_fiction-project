That part of this corpuscle
which surrounds the germinal vesicle (see the figures), becomes the source of the pe-
culiar granules (as I formerly termed them) by which this vesicle is surrounded. These peculiar granules—the objects snbsequently contained within the ovisac—are
not originally cells: so that the term granule proves to have been not inappropriate. The fact is, they are discs, having the same form and general appearance as discs in
other situations (only being very red); and by a change the same as that we have 80
often seen elsewhere, assume a cell-like appearance, and are reproduced in the same
manner as other discs. Hence, in advanced states of the ovisac, the quantity of
these objects becomes very large: and, as we formerly had occasion to observe, they
arrange themselves into structures, some of which—the retinacula—enter into the
formation of the mechanism regulating the expulsion of the ovumZ.

192. But my purpose in referring to these discs s0 fully in this place, is to be en-
abled to make the following addition : namely, that they also give origin to the mem-
brane of the ovisac, the discus vitellinus as well as the true yelk, and the membrane
of the yelk.
