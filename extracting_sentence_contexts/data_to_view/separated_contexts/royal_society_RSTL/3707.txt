In a former communication I
figured blood-corpuscles (cells) from which the contents, except the nucleus, had been
removed by acetic acid. If those figures be referred to, it will be found that the
nucleus s0 remaining is in many instances double. An examination of coagulating
blood enables me now to offer some explanation of this curious fact.

99. In fig. 150 is sketched a blood-corpuscle (cell) presenting a coiled filament, «. This coil having arisen out of the nucleus of the corpuscle or cell, the residual por-
tion of the nucleus becaine double by self-division : and then each half of the nucleus
formed a coil, s0 that an outer coil contained two smaller coils (Þ, 3), each having a
pellucid centre for future change.
