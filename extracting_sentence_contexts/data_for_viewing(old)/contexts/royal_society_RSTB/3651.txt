Some little distance to the South we find the Southern Midland fields of Warwick-
shire and South Staffordshire. There is reason to believe that these basins are also
related to the Pennine uplift, and to the North Midland basins,* but since their
geology and paleontology has been less thoroughly studied, the relationships are
still far from clear. We find, however, that, in both fields, the Middle Coal Measures
are the lowest horizon of the Upper Carboniferous represented, and that these rest,
in Warwickshire directly on Cambrian, and in South Staffordshire on Silurian rocks.
The Lower Coal Measures, Millstone Grits, and Carboniferous Limestones are here
absent, which is, of course, a fact deduced from geological rather than palzeobotanical
observation. It is scarcely necessary to emphasise the fact that the problem to be
solved here has much in common with that with which we are concerned in the West
of England and South Wales.

The tectonics of the districts under consideration here require much greater
attention than has at present been devoted to them before the relationships of these
coalfields can be made clear. It is, however, becoming obvious that, on the borders
of Gloucester and Somerset, we have evidence of possibly three distinct sets of axes,
and where three ways meet confusion is likely to arise. There are first of all the
East and West axes of South Wales, the Mendips and North Devon, to which the
coalfields of South Wales and of Devon and Cornwall, with their approximately
East and West strike, are no doubt to be correlated. A second uplift, possibly
subsidiary to, though connected with the Armorican uplift, with a direction roughly
