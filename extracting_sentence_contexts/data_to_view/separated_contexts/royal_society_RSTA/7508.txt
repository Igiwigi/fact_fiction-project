It seems more probable that the
oceans have an effect of the same order as that represented by the thin shells in d or Â¢
above. An independent estimate of this effect, based on an investigation of the induced
currents in a suitable non-uniform thin shell, would obviously be of value in this con-
nexion.

11. THE DEPTH OF PENETRATION OF THE INDUCED GURRE

The inferences, which can be drawn from the above results as to the distribution of
conductivity within the earth, are of course restricted by the fact that the induced
