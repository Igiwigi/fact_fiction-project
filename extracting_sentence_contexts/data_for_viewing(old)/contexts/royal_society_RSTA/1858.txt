The mention of these high-pressure experiments raises another aspect of the periodic table. : 3
The researchers who conduct such experiments have indicated that there should perhaps be an 8
alternative periodic table that applies to high-pressure conditions [44]. Moreover, the findings in : 8
relativistic quantum mechanics may also begin to show the need for an alternative periodic table 4

for elements with high atomic numbers in which relativity brings about significant changes in the
properties of certain elements.

12. Back to group 3 and conclusion

The realization that classification in general, and the specification of natural kinds, is not a purely
ontological question forces us to confront the fact that seeking an objectively optimal periodic is
rather futile. We should accept that a degree of convention must be used in selecting a periodic
table that can be presented as perhaps the best possible table that combines objective factors as
well as interest dependence.

Given these points I would like to propose that although there is no objective way to
distinguish the tables shown in figures 10 and 12 one should nevertheless opt for the former
of these as the official IUPAC periodic table. The factors that might lead us to favouring figure 10
have already been mentioned. They are that the d-block of the periodic table remains unified and
intact, whereas the table in figure 12 requires that the d-block be separated into two highly uneven
portions consisting of one and nine groups, respectively.

Talso believe that the table depicted in figure 13 should be rejected because it features one block
