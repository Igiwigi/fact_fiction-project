Tn the case of the paraffins ethane and propane, it was shown in my former paper
at one H can be replaced by a halogen without altering the value of y, but that the
roduction of a halogen into methane causes a fall in y. We see now that the
aturated gas ethylene behaves in the same way as methane, for the y of vinyl
mide is markedly lower than that of ethylene. Thus the possibility of inter-
nge of hydrogen with a halogen without altering y is not general, a fact that is
ught out still more clearly by a consideration of the higher substitution products. It was shown by Srrecker* that hydrochloric, hydrobromic and hydriodie acids
have nearly the same y us hydrogen, namely 1°4, whilst the y's of chlorine, bro-
Biine, iodine and iodine chloride all lie near 1°3. Hence in this case one halogen can
e put in the place of hydrogen without affecting y, but the introduction of a second
ogen causes a large fall.
