484 DR. PETTIGREW ON THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE FIBRES

The comparative size of the right and left ventricular cavities has been the subject of
considerable discussion, and is not likely s00n to be set at rest, from the yielding nature
of the ventricular parietes.

INFERENCE DEDUCED FROM A CONSIDERATION OF THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE FIBRES
IN THE VENTRICLES OF THE BIRD AND MAMMAL.

Without presuming dogmatically to assert that the ultimate arrangement of the fibres
of the ventricles of the bird and mammal is reducible to any known mathematical law, I
cannot, omit mentioning the fact that the arrangement in question can be s0 thoroughly
imitated, even in its details, by certain mechanical contrivances about to be explained,
that I would consider the present communication incomplete, were I not shortly to
direct attention to them.

If a sheet of paper, parchment, or any flexible material * whose length is twice that
of its breadth, be taken, and parallel lines drawn on either side of it in the direction of
the length, to represent the course of the fibres (Plate XV. diag. 1), all that requires to
be done, in order to convert it into a literal transcript of one-half of the left or typical
ventricle, is to lay it out lengthwise across a table, and, catching it by the right-hand
distant corner, to roll or turn in towards one's self a conical-shaped portion (C), and con-
tinue the rolling process in the direction of the opposite or oblique corner (U), until
three and a half turns of the sheet have been made and a hollow cone produced, as
