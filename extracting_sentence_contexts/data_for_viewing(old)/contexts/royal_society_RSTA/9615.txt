sphere of particles both before and after displacement is exactly nil at a point inside
the sphere. Thus the gravitational field set up by a displacement of order 1
neutralises itself in a way not contemplated in the general argument outlined above.
Also the vibrations of order 1 and of greatest wave-length in the interior are not
available, for they represent solely a rigid body displacement.

The question of vibrations of order 1 is treated in §§ 3-7; it is shown that they
may be disregarded, and we pass to the consideration of vibrations of orders 2, 3, ...,
expecting (as, in fact, is found to be the case) that instability will first set in through
a vibration of order 2.

It is only possible to discuss special cases, and the one which is most amenable to
analysis is that in which the pressure and density are connected by Larracer’s law,
p =e(p*—o*). It is first proved (§§ 8-11) that, for a mass of such matter at rest,
the spherical form is stable for all displacements. Later (§§ 15-22) it is shown that
this is true when ¢ varies inside the mass ; it is true even up to the case which is the
most likely to be unstable, in which the matter in the interior is of negligible density
and the main part of the mass is collected in a surface crust—a sort of astronomical
soap-bubble.

We proceed next to examine for what amount of rotation these figures will become
