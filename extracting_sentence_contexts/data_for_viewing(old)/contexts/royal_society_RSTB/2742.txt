but recuperation and pigment formation begin actually during cestrus.* The
relation of these periods to dicstrum, procestrum, cestrus, and metcestrum depends
really upon the intensity or abbreviation, as the case may be, of the changes charac-
terising them. These changes appear to differ somewhat in intensity according to
the individual, while I have some slight evidence for the assertion that the severity
of the process tends to decrease with each successive cycle in the sexual season.

Tt may be at once noted that the method here adopted of classifying the sheep’s
uterine stages is similar to that employed by Mitnes MarsHatt (1893), and by
Mr, Watrer Hear (1894, 1897) in grouping the menstrual periods of the human
species and of monkeys. The further subdivision in time of these periods in the
case of the sheep is scarcely warrantable, owing to the abbreviation of the procestrous
process and the fact that certain characters essential to the occurrence of one period
may co-exist with others belonging properly to the next period, present elsewhere in
the same uterus. —

(1.) Period of Rest.—The histological characters of the uterine mucosa at this:
period, as compared with those of the succeeding periods, may be said to be almost
purely negative.

Protoplasmic processes can be seen to be passing from many of the stroma nuclei.
But these, though denser in some places than others, show little evidence of division.
The slightly denser patches appear arranged quite irregularly.

The blood-vessels are small and comparatively scarce. Those that are present
