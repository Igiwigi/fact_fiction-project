The coaly substance of


FROM THE JURASSIC ROCKS OF YORKSHIRE 77

A, manis has contracted and cracked into minute rectangular blocks which come apart
when the fossil is removed from the rock. This is apparently a property of the fossil
substance, and is not due to the thinness of its cuticle, for it is the parts of A. manis
where the coaly substance is thickest that are the most friable, while other fossils in
the same bed with just as thin cuticles are coherent. This fact, which has meant that
pieces as small as 0-1 x 0-2 mm. have been used for cuticle preparations, has con-
siderably increased the difficulty of description. Ficure 1. Androstrobus manis.
