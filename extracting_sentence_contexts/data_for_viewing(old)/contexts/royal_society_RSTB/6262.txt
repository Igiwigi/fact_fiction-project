tudinally coursing fibres, figs. 4-6. These are mostly the terminal fibres of the
lateral longitudinal fasciculus. At the level from which the large commissura
transversa takes its origin, fig. 4, the torus has three differentiated areas. The
ventrolateral area consists of the ascending lateral fasciculus fibres, and the
transverse commissure fibres. The middle layer is a zone of large cells that are
compactly arranged. The inner layer contains very few cells and the thin fibres
are poorly medullated. This latter, apparently, is a synaptic layer in which the
octavus neurites arborize among the dendrites from the cell layer, and in turn the
neurites of these cells form the emerging fibres of the transverse commissure. The entire
arrangement here is strikingly similar to the three layers of the tuberculum acusticum.

Intimately associated with the outer part of the torus semicircularis is the “ tiefes
Mark.”’ In fact, Ravi (1915, p. 529) considers the “ tiefes Mark” as one of the
four parts into which he divides the torus. In Diaphus the amount of exchange of
fibres between this system and the torus is very difficult to determine.

The torus semicircularis, besides the large connections with the lateral longitudinal
fasciculus and the commissura transversa, has lesser connections with the ganglion
isthmi. ;

In many teleosts the ganglion isthmi consists of a pars magnocellularis and a pars
parvocellularis (KappeErs, 1921, figs. 429 and 430, Perca fluviatilis). Burr, however,
(1928, p. 59) failed to find a bipartite nucleus in Orthagoriscus.
