directly selected, however widely changed by indirect selection, (ii.) that the formule
involve al! the directly selected organs closely correlated with stature, or that the
selection has been principally one of size, and not of variability of, or correlation
between, these organs. The real test of the applicability of the formule is whether
or not they give for another local race of which we know & priori the stature, results
in agreement with themselves and with the known stature. I take it that the justi-
fication required for applying our formule to paleolithic man is not the statement that
ethnic are less than individual intra-racial variations, but is to be drawn from the
fact that our formule, based upon measurements on the French, give results very fairly
consistent among themselves and with observation for such a divergent race as the
Aino. Such results seem to indicate that racial differences in stature are not the
result of direct selection of stature, and that the selection of the long bones has been
rather a selection of their absolute and relative sizes than a selection, in the first
place, of their degrees of variation and correlation, although these have to some extent
undoubtedly changed.

Our general theorems will to some degree indicate the manner in which differentia-
tion has taken place. Suppose there has been a selection of femur and tibia, but not
of humerus and radius. Then the regression formule for stature on femur and tibia,
and for stature on femur and tibia together with one or both of the other two, humerus
and radius, ought to give identical results; but these results ought to differ from
