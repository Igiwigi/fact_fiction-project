In the lecture notes of his 1893-94 course, Hilbert referred once again to the natural character
of geometry and explained the possible role of axioms in elucidating its foundations. As he had
time to correct the notes, he now made explicit reference to Hertz’s characterization of a ‘correct’
scientific image (Bild) or theory. Thus Hilbert wrote [6, p. 87]:

Nevertheless the origin [of geometrical knowledge] is in experience. The axioms are, as
Hertz would say, images or symbols in our mind, such that consequents of the images are
again images of the consequences, i.e. what we can logically deduce from the images is
itself valid in nature.

Hilbert also pointed out the need of establishing the independence of the axioms of geometry,
while alluding, once again, to the kind of demand stipulated by Hertz. Stressing the objective and
factual character of geometry, Hilbert wrote:

The problem can be formulated as follows: What are the necessary, sufficient, and mutually
independent conditions that must be postulated for a system of things, in order that any of
their properties correspond to a geometrical fact and, conversely, in order that a complete
description and arrangement of all the geometrical facts be possible by means of this system
of things.

The axioms of geometry and of physical disciplines, Hilbert said, ‘express observations of facts
of experience, which are so simple that they need no additional confirmation by physicists in the
laboratory’.

The empirical character of geometry has its clear expression in the importance attributed
