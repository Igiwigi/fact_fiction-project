and 2 = Q,, and compare it with the (1,1) plot of figure 4a. The value of the damping term has
been fixed in order to study the possibility to restore the interwell oscillations for a case where the
oscillations are completely damped.

It can be seen in figure 8a how the high-amplitude oscillations (yellow region) are restored for
increasing values of F. Interestingly, the figure shows a mirror symmetry with respect to figure 4a.
The system’s dynamics can be checked in figure 8b, where we represent a slice of figure 8a, for
F=0.14. It is possible to see that the figure is similar to figure 1a, which displays the evolution
of the amplitude versus t for the case js = 0. In fact, in figure 82,b, it is possible to appreciate that
all the regions that remained unaffected by the damping are also not affected by the forcing. On
the other hand, the system’s behaviour in Region IV is the same as with js = 0, once the forcing
amplitude reaches values close to F = 0.14.

In the light of these results, we can confidently say that the damping-induced unpredictability
has disappeared and, finally, the interwell oscillations have been restored by increasing a small
amount the forcing parameter F. Also, in Region IV, the no-damping situation is fully recovered
due to the interaction of the time delay and the forcing, ie. the delay-induced resonance
phenomenon.

In figure 9, we show, from left to right, the phase space orbits and the FFT of two trajectories
with different F values, for a better understanding of actual result. In the first case (figure 9a,b),
