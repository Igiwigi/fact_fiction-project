OF THE FIBRES OF THE POSTERIOR ROOTS OF SPINAL NERVES. 169

In the Rabbit, extension of the knee is still rarer as the primary movement of a
spinal reflex than even in Cat and Dog, but, on account of the relatively slight
depression caused by spinal transection in the Rabbit, it is a very frequent movement in
the course of the “ march” of a spinal reflex. It does not, however, occur nearly so
frequently—in fact, I have never yet seen it oecur as the initial movement of the
crossed side in the Rabbit—for in Rabbit, flexion of the knee and hip seem the
primary crossed just as they are the primary idio-lateral reflexes. This is in obvious
relation to the mode of progression of the animal. Thus, in Rabbit, a pinch of the
tail will cause symmetrically bilateral flexions, followed by extensions of the hind-
alimbs, although in the fore-limbs flexion of one fore-limb occurs with extension of the
“pposite fore-limb. Pinch of one foot will evoke flexion of the knees and hips of both

Sides, instead of flexion of idio-lateral and extension of contra-lateral knee, as is usual
Es the Cat.
