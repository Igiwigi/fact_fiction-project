the mosquitoes’ behaviour in moving air over still stripes, and over moving stripes in still
air, evidently both depend on visual responses to the movement of the stripes relative to the
mosquito, and experiments in darkness provided direct proof of this. The movement of
a stripe relative to the mosquito can stimulate it only as an image passing over the retina,
and a given retinal velocity can be produced by the mosquito’s flight alone, by its being
carried by the wind as well and, in experiments, by movement of the striped floor.

These facts indicate that the mosquito has a preferred retinal velocity, divergences from
which evoke compensatory responses. Three types of response were observed:

(1) change of air speed,

(2) change of orientation,

(3) settling.

In the original account of this work it was suggested that compensatory responses were
evoked whenever the retinal velocity departed from some supposedly ‘normal’ range: that
experienced in free flight in still air over a still background. This suggestion took no account
of the fact that the retinal velocity experienced under such conditions would vary with the
