The Sydney series
was examined before I had access to the remainder. It will be observed that,
whereas every Queensland brain has a well-marked sulcus lunatus of some form or
other, this sulcus does not form an unusually prominent feature in the Sydney series. In fact, the number of clearly defined sulci lunati is not greater than, if as great as,
one would expect to find in the brains of the Southern Chinese. Before having
seen the Queensland material I told Professor ELtior Smiru of the results of my
examination of the Sydney material. This is recorded in the Mott Memorial
Volume.
