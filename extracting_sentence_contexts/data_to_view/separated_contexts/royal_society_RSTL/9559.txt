This division of the nerves usually induces,
for 8ome time after the operation, more or less tetanie-like rigidity of the rays. The
operation, however, although 0 completely destroying physiological continuity in the
rows of pedicels and muscular system of the rays, does not destroy, or perceptibly
impair, physiological continuity in the external nerve-plexus ; for however much the
nerve-ring and nerve-trunks may be injured, stimulation of the dorsal snrface of the
animal throws all the pedicels and muscular system of the rays into active movement. This fact proves that the pedicels and muscles are all held in nervous connexion with
one another by the external plexus, without reference to the integrity of the main
trunks.

(B.) Eehiniâ€”If a cork-borer be rotated against the external surface of an Fehinus
till the calcareous swbstance of the shell is reached, and therefore a continuous circular

section of the overlying tissues effected, the spines and pedicellarie within the cireular
area are physiologically separated from those without it, as regards their local reflex
irritability. That is to say, if any part of this circular area is stimulated, all the
spines and pedicellarie within that area immediately respond to the stimulation in
the ordinary way, while none of the spines or pedicellarie suwrounding the area are
affected, and conversely. Therefore we conclude that the function of the spines and
pedicellarizz of localising and gathering round a seat of stimulation, is exclusively
dependent upon the external nervous plexus.
