TY, IOIOG) By the equilibrium-theory, the change which would be produced by any alteration of
the moon's force would correspond to the effect of an alteration in the value of #, the
amount of the lunar tide. It appears from the examination of the observations, that
this change takes place in fact, but that we must also suppose a change in z' in order
that the formula (a.) may represent the observed intervals of time. This change in
x, the retroposition of the tide in longitude, is

tan 2 (0 — 3) =

25 (p — 57) for parallax p minutes. (See Art.
