And it is evident that this fact tends to negative the above explanation ; for if the dis-
charges of the ganglia are independently simultaneous before section, we might expect
them to continue 80 after section. It must be remembered, however, that the form of
section we are considering Is a severe one, and that it must therefore not only give rise
to general shock, but also greatly interfere with the passage of contractile waves, and, in
general, disturb the delicate conditions on which, according to- the 8uggested explana-
tion, the previous harmony depended. Besides, we have before seen that for some reason
or other segmentation of a Medusa profoundly modifies the rate of its rhythm. In view
of these considerations, therefore, the results yielded by such experiments must not be
regarded as having any conclusive bearing on the question before us. And as these or
s1milar objections apply to various other modes of section by which I have endeavoured
to settle this question, I will not here occupy space in detailing them. It seems
desirable, however, in this connexion again to mention a fact briefly stated in my former
paper, namely, that section conclusively proves a contractile wave to have the power,
when it reaches a lithocyst, of stimulating the latter into activity ; for * it is not diffi-
cult to obtain a series of lithocysts connected in snch a manner that the resistance offered
to the passage of the waves by a certain width of the junction-tissne is 8uch as just to
allow the residuum of the contractile wave which emanates from one lithocyst to reach

the adjacent lithoeyst, thus cansing it to originate another wave which, in turn, is just
able to pass to the next lithocyst in the series, and s0 on, each lithocyst in turn acting
like a reinforcing battery to the passage of the contractile wave‚Äù *. Now this fact, T
