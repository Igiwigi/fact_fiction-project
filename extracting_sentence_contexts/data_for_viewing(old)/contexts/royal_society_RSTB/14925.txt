to the observed number of fish per picture. Shown are observed proportions of mollies (blue) as well as the intervals between the 0.025 and the 0.975 quantiles
(orange) expected for random mixing. (c) Body size distributions of Poecilia sulphuraria and Gambusia eurystoma caught at the same river locations. (d) Polarization,

trend for the proportion of gambusia to decrease with shoal switched to full ASR behaviour (R?= 0.69, median surface
size (figure 2b) is a by-product of the fact that there are far

fewer gambusia than mollies in the population, in combination
with the assortative behaviour. In photographs with a numeri-
cal dominance of mollies, fish were significantly more
polarized and more dense (lower NND and higher neighbour
count within 2 BL radius, figure 2d-f) than in shoals containing
more gambusia.
