Hence, modes can exit the Hubble radius. After

inflation the Universe evolves according to Big Bang cosmology, the Hubble radius grows linearly in time, and scales re-enter

the Hubble radius. (Online version in colour.)

gravitational waves [12,13] is then almost scale-invariant. The small red tilt of the spectrum stems
from the fact that H(t) decreases slowly in time. The inflationary scenario is based on the assumption that there was a period in the early
Universe during which space expands (almost) exponentially. In general, cosmological inflation is
studied at the level of an EFT based on general relativity and scalar field matter.
