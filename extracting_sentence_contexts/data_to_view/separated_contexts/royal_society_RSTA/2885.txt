It would seem that in the case of scandium and the other elements named
the region of the are in which enhanced lines are produced is of greater extent than
in the case of such substances as iron. However that may be, the H and K lines of
calcium, the lines 4078, 4215 of strontium, the lines 4554, 4934 of barium, and the
lines of scandium in question, have all the other characteristics of enhanced lines and
may be properly regarded as such, They are weakened in the flame, relatively
brightened in the spark, and are isolated from the other lines of the are spectra when
observed in the upper chromosphere and in certain stellar spectra. The enhanced
lines are, in fact, to be regarded as forming a distinct spectrum of scandium, which
may or may not co-exist ‘with the other lines according to circumstances, A separate
list of these lines is given in Table V.

The Arc-Flame Spectrum. An economical method of producing an approximation to the flame spectrum was
suggested by the observations of the spectrum of euxenite, to which reference has
already been made. It was felt that the material available was inadequate for the
effective use of the oxyhydrogen flame, or even for the comparatively long exposures
required for the outer part of the flame of an ordinary are.
