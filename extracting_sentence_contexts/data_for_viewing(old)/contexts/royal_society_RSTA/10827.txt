wall, and consist for the most part of ash with more or less abundant coulées
of lava.

So far as it was possible for us to ascertain, the geological structure of St. Vincent is
very simple, All around the coasts the dip of the rocks as indicated by the great
lava flows and the more persistent beds of ash, is outwards from the centre. On the
leeward side the lavas dip to the west at gentle angles (averaging about 10°). At
the south end and near Kingstown the dip is mostly south, while on the east or
windward side the dip is also towards the sea. The ash beds are more irregular in
this respect, and within short distances may show considerable variations. But,
taken as a whole, they always agree fairly well with the dip of the lava flows, and
they practically never show an inclination towards the centre of the island. We are,
in fact, dealing with a highly eroded volcanic pile, a chain of old voleanoes, and the
position of the craters and outlets must have nearly corresponded with the central
ridge of hills. The radial outward dip is a reflex of the slopes down which the
lavas flowed, and on which the ash beds gathered. Over these surfaces the streams
ran in more or less direct courses to the sea.

Along this central ridge, apparently, no craters, except that of the Soufriére, can
now be found, and none are indicated on the map. Erosion, most rapid on the
higher grounds, has already obliterated them. But it is there they are to be searched
for, and though the task is a well-nigh hopeless one, the remains of them may yet
be found. In all probability most of them are filled with agglomerate, but some
may be represented by great bosses of crystalline rock like the Pitons of St. Lucia.
