The latter solution should be
freshly prepared, and should not be much exposed to light. 'The observations should
also, in this case, be made within a short time after the addition of the nitrite to the
blood-solution, as otherwise the solution often becomes turbid. The fact that ammonia altered the colour of blood which had been treated with
nitrites from a chocolate-colour to red, might be explained on the supposition that some
<Lhange had occurred in the constitution of the body formed under their influence, although
J was quite possible that the spectrum of the body in a decidedly alkaline fluid might be
Aifferent from that of the same substance in a nearly neutral solution. In order to deter-
Hine whether the difference induced in the colour and spectram was merely due to the
Slkalinity of the fluid, or to the presence of free ammonia, I prepared a dilute solution
Sf ammonia. This solution contained 10 grms.
