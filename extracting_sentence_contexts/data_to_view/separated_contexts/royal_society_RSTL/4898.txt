Until lately I had
always found the black patches of Coniothecium unconnected with any other sort of
fungoid growth; but in some specimens which I met with during the last summer
(1856), I found upon stripping off the epidermis of the Willow branch, that the Conio-
thecium was in immediate connexion with a perithecium which lay buried beneath the
outer bark of the Willow. Upon extracting the perithecium the Coniothecium con-
tGued adherent to it, the threads of the latter projecting from the apex of the perithe-
Rum, and giving it the appearance of being crowned with a little brush. The question
tEn arose, whether the Coniothecium really belonged to the perithecium, or whether it
= merely parasitical upon it, and I satisfied myself that the former was the case; for
ugon examining the perithecium with the microscope, there was no trace to be seen of
apy threads traversing its outer surface, and that being the case, the only other conclu-
San in accordance with the facts. was, that the threads of the Coniothecium were in
oSnnexion with and formed a continuation of the threads constituting the lining of the
perithecium. ZIn this instance most of the perithecia had nothing in their interior but a tangled
ngLSs of colourless filamentous tissue, but one or two of them contained a number of
Sores not enclosed in asci, but intermixed irregularly with the filamentous tissue.
