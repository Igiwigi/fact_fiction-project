In
Ontario, the provincial government had brought electricity to nearly all its citizens, and at costs
that were lower than the privately generated electricity available just across the Falls. And it was
this key fact—that public electricity was cheaper—that the industry began to fight.

3. The National Electric Lighting Association response

Industry leaders insisted that the alleged facts about Ontario power were not facts at all. (They
also worked to prevent Pinchot’s re-election. He eked out a victory, but the narrow margin was
probably mostly due to his support for prohibition.) More than that, they linked their opposition
to a general campaign of advertising, public relations and academic influence intended to counter
any suggestion that public generation or management of electricity was desirable, to strengthen
the conviction of the American people that the private sector did best, and to promote the idea
that anything other than private control of industry was socialistic and therefore un-American. Specifically they argued that

(1) private ownership works: electricity rates are fair, service is good and the public is
adequately protected by state regulation; federal involvement in electricity would be
inappropriate, socialistic, and lead to tyranny;

(2) private ownership alone gives opportunity for individual initiative, which is the
cornerstone of US national success and prosperity; and, therefore,

(3) government involvement in activities that should properly be the domain of free
enterprise will undermine individual initiative and ultimately destroy American
prosperity.
