If the calculated correction of
IL. be applied to R. and P., the difference should have been —‘28. This would have
been in the course —*024, —*28, —°03, and then the method of least squares would
have brought these into close agreement. In fact, the considerable error in P’ (2) has
pulled the calculated values for P’ (1.3.4) out of their proper places. A similar result
is shown in 8”. If the calculated wave-length values of 8 (2.3) be compared with
R. and P.’s corrected values from II., the differences would be 2°75, ‘007, ‘007, instead
of 2°84, —:026, 007, and if they had been used to calculate the constants the agree-
ment would have been much closer.
