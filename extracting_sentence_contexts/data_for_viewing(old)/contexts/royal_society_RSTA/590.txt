calibrate the model.

The calibration of the nonlinear terms of the model is absolutely indispensable. The reason
being that it is only the nonlinear terms that go beyond the Gaussian model and provide a
microeconomic potential that has a minimum, and which can match the average market price
of a given commodity. In particular, in the absence of the nonlinear terms, the quadratic potential
yields all average market prices to be zero and is clearly quite useless for analysing market prices.

We show below that the values of the nonlinear terms are 10 times greater than the error
terms, clearly showing that the value of the nonlinear terms is a defining feature of market prices.
To check the consistency of the evaluation of the nonlinear terms using Feynman diagrams, a
numerical simulation has been carried out in [2] to confirm that the range of the nonlinear terms
obtained from the market data can in fact be obtained using the Feynman perturbation expansion.

The action is written in terms of the scaled variable y(t) and we obtain
