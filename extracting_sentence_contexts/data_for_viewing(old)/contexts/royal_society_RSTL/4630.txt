which is the locus of M, comes nearest the axis at C, and recedes from that axis con-
stantly between C and B. Hence it is plain that the fringes must increase (they
being in proportion to the united action of A and B) from C toB; and in like manner
must those made by B's deflexion and A's inflexion increase constantly from C to A;
and this is true whatever be the law of the bending force, provided it is in some in-
verse ratio to the distance.

ProePosITION X.

It is proved by experiment that the fringes or images increase as the distance in-
creases from the direct rays.

Exp. 1. Repeated observations and measurements satisfy us of this fact. We may
either receive the images on a chart at various distances from the double edge in-
strument, approacking the edges until the fringes appear, or we may receive them
on a plate of ground glass held between the sun and the eye. We may thus measure
them with a micrometer; but no such nicety is required, because their increase in
breadth is manifest. The only doubt is with respect to their relative breadth when
the edges are not very near and just when they begin to form fringes. Sometimes it
should seem that these very narrow fringes decrease instead of increasing. However,
it is not probable that this should be found true, at least when care is taken to place
the two edges exactly opposite each other ; because if it were true that at this greater
distance of A from B (fig. 17) they decreased, then there must be a minimum value
of PM between C and B, and between Cand A; and consequently the law of flexion
must-vary in the different distances of A and B from the rays P, a supposition at
