HQ) concentration increasing in a linear manner with catalyst content, up to a catalyst mass of
0.1 g, beyond which H2O) concentration continues to increase but nonlinearly, in a similar fashion
to H2 conversion (electronic supplementary material, table S.2). This in part may be related to a
slight rise in activity towards the degradation of H2Oz, as indicated by the marginal decrease
in HjQ, selectivity at larger catalyst masses. Which in turn results from increased contact time
between reactant gases and the catalyst. Indeed, the relationship between H2O2 degradation
activity and H2Q2 concentration is well known [18]. However, it is suggested that the observed
differences in catalytic selectivity are not significant. It is possible, given the relatively high flow
rates used within this study, that the plateau observed in H2O2 concentration can be related to
limitations associated with reactant gas diffusion to the catalyst. Alternatively, it is also possible
that as the liquid and gas flow rates were held constant during these experiments and in turn
residence time across the catalyst bed is modified (electronic supplementary material, table S.2)
that in fact H2O2 synthesis and degradation rates are equivalent, resulting in a plateauing of
observable HO, concentration. Regardless, selectivity towards H2O, is seen to remain high,
exceeding 85%.

The effect of total reaction pressure was next investigated (figure 4), while maintaining all
other reaction conditions. As expected, an enhancement in H2Q 2 concentration was observed
with increasing pressure. These results show that pressure had no effect on catalytic selectivity,
which remains constant at 85%. This is in keeping with our previous observations into supported
AuPd nanoparticles, under both flow [27] and batch [30] regimes, where both H2O2 synthesis and
degradation pathways increase proportionally with pressure. The first order dependence of H2O2
