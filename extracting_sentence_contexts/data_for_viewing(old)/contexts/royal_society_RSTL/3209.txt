My pzar Farapay,

Is my last letter to you, which the Royal Society have done me the honour to pub-
lish in the Philosophical Transactions for 1838, I observed, that * the principal cir-
cumstance which might be supposed to limit the power of an active point within a
conducting sphere, in any given electrolyte, is the resistance of that electrolyte, which
increases in a certain ratio to its depth or thickness.” The superficial measure of the
conducting sphere, and the distance of the generating metal, or the depth and re-
sistance of the electrolyte, are, in fact, the variable conditions in a voltaic combina-
tion upon which its efficiency depends; and their relations require further investiga-
tion before we shall be able to determine what may be the proper proportions for the
economical application of the power to useful purposes. I shall venture, therefore, to
trouble you with the results of some further experiments upon the subject, and upon
different combinations of the constant battery, before I proceed to communicate ome
observations upon Electrolysis, which I trust you will find not without interest, and
to which, according to my plan, my attention has been lately exclusively directed.

Looking, for a moment, upon the affinity which circulates in the battery as a ra-
diant force, it seemed desirable to ascertain what would be the result of intercepting
the rays by the conducting surface nearer to their centre than in the arrangements
which have been previously described, as the relation of the generating and con-
