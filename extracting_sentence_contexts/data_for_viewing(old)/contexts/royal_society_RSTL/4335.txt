of prehension, deglutition, digestion or assimilation. At the lower part of the
animal, on the other side of, and "opposite to the valvular opening, are three small
oval bodies (Plate XXXIV. fig. 12 H), massed together, having no communications by
tube or otherwise, but fixed in their place by sbort ligaments, that may be rudiments
of a stomach.

They are not testes, for they have no communications with the sperm-bag, and they
do not exist in the female. I have therefore provisionally regarded them as the
rudiments of a digestive apparatus.

The difference of sex in these two forms is plainly evidenced by the fact, not only
of the difference of structure, the presence of active spermatozoa in the male, but by
the observed fact of the intromission of the male organ into the vaginal canal of
the female. That the male animal is produced by the female and developed within
the ovisac in the same manner as the female embryo, is also proved by many observa-
tions; and one of the drawings of the male has been made from a specimen $till in
the interior of the parent, and eyen at that period having its sperm-bag filled with
active spermatozoa,

Thus this animal is not androgynous, and a careful reconsideration of the whole
family of Hydatina is desirable to determine whether this law prevails in this exten-
sive group of infusory animalcules. Had the male not been traced ab ovo, or had it

been met with apart from female specimens in the water, it had been taken for a
