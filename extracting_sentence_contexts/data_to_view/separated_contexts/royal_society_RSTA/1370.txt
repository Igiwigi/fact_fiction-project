In both works [33,34], a parametric description of the curve is provided. a
However, this is not enough for representing the microstructure in terms of the zero value of : g

a level-set function which is in general more appropriate in a topology optimization framework. In this work, we provide such an implicit description of the microstructure and its corresponding
level-set. In the unit square cell Y with coordinates (y1, 1/2), the level-set function of the Vigdergauz
microstructure is defined as

The fact that y, is not continuous at the boundary of the inner rectangle (—m1/2,1m/2) x
(—mz/2,m2/2) does not matter here since only its sign is important. Thus, the value of co <0
can be taken arbitrarily but is negative. In this work, we take cp = —|o|.
