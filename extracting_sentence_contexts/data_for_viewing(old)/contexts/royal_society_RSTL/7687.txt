z(hy+9z)=0, the two lines whereof intersect on the conic (1, 1, 1, x, {#, YLw, y, 2Y=0;
and similarly, if g=0, then Þ*+f*—2uhf=0, or if h=0, then + f—2fg=0. As
noticed above this system occurs twice.

'The second system is

frh—0, (Pt +1—2agh—2uhf—2ofg)(L—M—p*—1 +23)
+((w—)f+(3—8)g +(ph—v)bY=0,
or, as the second equation may also be written,
PU—B)(L=2)+fA—PX1=32)+P(L—2(L—w?)
+2gh(1—2)(w—2) +2hf1 —w)(k—6)+2fp(1—=)(4—v)=0,

which expresses that a line of the line-pair touches the conic; in fact the system is
satisfied by f=0, 9f(1—#)+H(1—v?) + 29gk(pwr—Xx)=0, viz. we have here the line-pair
z(hy+gz)=0, in which the line hy +gz=0 touches the conic (1, 1, 1,5, w, »XLz, y,2)*=0;
and the like if 9q==0, or if 4=0. This system it has been secen occurs only once.

Annex No. 3 (referred to, No. 22).—On the conics which pass through two given points
and touch a given conic.

Consider the conics which pass through two given points and touch a given conic.
We may take Z=0 as the equation of the line through the two given points, and then
taking the pole of this line in regard to the given conic and joining it with the two
given points respectively, the equations of the joining lines may be taken to be X=0
and Y=0 respectively. This being 80, we have for the given points (X=0, Z=0) and
