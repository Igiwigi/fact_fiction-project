became in time choked with a crimson mass of corpuscles in that part of its extent
which lay beneath the mustard ; but immediately beyond, in both directions, the blood

ably less; and these moyed freely to and fro when the web was touched, whereas those

corpuscles did not reside specially in the capillaries, and also showed distinetly that it
could not be explained by mere abnormal adhesiveness of the vascular parietes, which
