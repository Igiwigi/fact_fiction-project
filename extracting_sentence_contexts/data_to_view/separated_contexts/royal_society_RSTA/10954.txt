In the older age
groups, on the other hand, in the cases of mental derangement and imbecility, the
females show the greater proportion of defectives. Thus at first sight it would appear that the female, though at first a greatly
superior animal to the male, was liable to break down mentally at a much more rapid
rate and at an earlier age. This, however, would probably be a fallacious conclusion ;
it is pointed out in the Census Report for 1881 that the death-rate for male
lunatics is known to be very much higher than for female lunatics—almost half as
high again in fact.t Hence the greater proportion per 1000 living at the later age
groups may, either entirely or to a large extent, be simply due to accumulation. There is apparently no evidence that the case-rate is greater for females at the
higher age groups. Thus, so far as we can say at present, the female may remain
the less defective animal throughout life.
