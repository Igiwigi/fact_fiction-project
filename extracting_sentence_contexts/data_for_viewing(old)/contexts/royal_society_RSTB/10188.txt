threonine allele also segregates in D. simulans (employing the
same codon sequence) is intriguing, although the threonine
state is rare in D. simulans (0.05% observed frequency).

In the Attacin A/B locus, a lack of reciprocal monophyly
between D. simulans and D. mauritiana is suggestive of intro-
gression through hybridization between species (electronic
supplementary material, figure S1). However, a systematic
study of introgression patterns between the two species [33]
did not report any of the Attacin genes as having a signature
of recent introgression, indicating that, if these regions are
introgressed, either the introgression was ancient and this poly-
