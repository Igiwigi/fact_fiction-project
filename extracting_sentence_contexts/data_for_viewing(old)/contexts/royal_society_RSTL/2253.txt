546 DR. DAVY ON THE TORPEDO.

appeared to be completely interrupted. In very many experiments, employing the
most active fish, if there were any visible space between the ends of the red-hot pla-
tina wire, I never witnessed the galyanometer in connexion with one wire affected,
nor could obtain a shock. Reasoning on the subject, this perhaps is what might be
expected, considering that the surface of the fish is a better conductor than air. One
fact, however, which I had observed, afforded some encouragement to persist in the
trials, the fact that the torpedinal electricity passes through distilled water, which is
a worse conductor of it than its own skin.

I thought it possible that by insulating the Torpedo on a plate of dry glass, and
wiping its circumference dry and smearing it with oil, that either a spark might be
procured, or that the galvanometer might be affected. But in this, too, I have been
disappointed ; not even in flame, when the interruption of the circle has been only
just visible, has any effect on the instrument been produced, or any chemical effect,
using the delicate test of solution of iodide of potassium and starch.

In a few experiments on metallic conductors, the effect of the electricity of the
Torpedo on the galvanometer appeared to be much the same, whatever metals were
