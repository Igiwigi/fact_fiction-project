The last column contains the values obtained by H. F. Weper,* for the mean

= thermal conductivities between 9° and 15°.

As a result of the experiments, we may state that the thermal conductivities of
liquids decrease with increase of temperature in the neighbourhood of 30° C., at a
percentage rate which appears to be roughly the same for a number of liquids.

Parr III. Cuancre or Conpucriviry on MEttina.

Combining the last result with the one obtained for solids, Part I., and with the fact
that solids in general conduct heat better than liquids, and liquids better than gases,
we are led to conjecture that a given substance will, as its temperature is increased,
decrease in conductivity, and that the decrease will continue during any change of
state which the substance may undergo, owing to the increase in temperature. ‘The
