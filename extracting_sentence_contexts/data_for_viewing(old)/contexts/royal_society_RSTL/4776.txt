ducts derived from madder to sublimation, do not exist ready formed in this root,
and are only products derived from another substance which has not yet been is0-
EH5 From numerous experiments which I have made on this subject, it follows
that the colouring matter of madder may be compared, in respect to the derivatives
to which it gives rise, to tannin, s0 that I do not despair of being able, as far as re-
gards their metamorphoses, to establish a parallel between the products derived from
madder and those obtained from tannin. If it should be possible to confer on the
former that tendency to assume regular forms with which the latter are endowed,
the separation of the proximate colouring or colour-giving (colorable) matters of
madder will be easy, and it will thus be possible to establish their elementary com-
position and thence their relation to one another,”

To Mr. J. Hiccin is due the merit of having first called attention to the fact, that
important changes take place during the process of dyeing with madder, which can
only be explained by supposing that an actual formation of colouring matter takes
place during the process. In his paper © On the Colouring Matters of Madderf,
Mr. Hiccin has detailed his experiments on that peculiar substance discovered in
madder by KUnLiMaxN and called by him Xanthine. I have shown, on a former occa-
Sion, that the xanthine of Kunimany and other investigators is not a pure substance,
but a mixture of two distinct substances. This fact however does not affect the cor-
rectness of Mr, Hiccin's conclusions, the general 'accuracy of which I shall have
great, pleasure in confirming in the course of this paper. The presence of xanthine
is easily ascertained by the deep yellow colour and intensely bitter taste which it
communicates to cold water. Guided by these two tests, Mr. Hiccix arrived at the
concInsion, that in an infusion of madder, made with cold or tepid water, when left
