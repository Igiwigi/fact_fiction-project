One o
their important inferences is that the log law with a Karman constant of 0.384 is
the correct velocity distribution in the overlap region. Their Karman constant is
smaller than the accepted value of ca 0.4, which itself is smaller than the value o
0.42 advocated by researchers working with the Superpipe. It is heartening tha’
one can, these days, have enough confidence in measurements to claim that 0.38
and 0.42 are, in fact, different without rounding them both off to a ‘universal’
value of 0.4. If further assessments support these claims, it is apparent, at the
least, that the log law, if it exists, is not universal. Another point of emphasis placed in this paper is the excessive slowness with
which the normalized properties of the boundary layer, such as the shape factor
and the skin-friction coefficient, decay with the Reynolds number.
