There are no typical protoxylem elements, although the internal tracheides are formed
first.” This type of structure is almost exactly what we get in the Calamite twigs. Prof. Jerrrey’s description might, in fact, have been written about the structure
seen in section $900. Another comparison can be drawn between the Calamite
twigs and the young Equisetum stems with reference to the number of leaves in the
whorls, In the former this is usually four or six, but from impression-specimens
we see that the number was often much greater in thicker stems. A similar state
of affairs exists in the Equisetum stems.
