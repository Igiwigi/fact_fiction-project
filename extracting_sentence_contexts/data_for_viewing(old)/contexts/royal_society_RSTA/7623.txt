as most observers claim limits of experimental accuracy which are only a small fraction
of this range.


DISPERSION OF AIR FOR THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM 3

(b) New determinations for metrological purposes. When formal sanction was given by
the Seventh General Conference on Weights and Measures (Comité Int. 1927) to the
proposal that determinations of length might be made, as an alternative to direct
reference to the metre, in terms of the wave-length of the red line of cadmium, the
attention of metrologists became particularly directed to the variations in recorded
values of the refractive index of air for the visible spectrum. The reason for this is
evident from the fact that the relationship which had temporarily to be adopted was
one between the metre and the wave-length in air under certain standard conditions.
Since the wave-length of a radiation varies in inverse proportion to the refractive index
of the medium through which the radiation is transmitted, a possible variation of
about + 2 parts in 10°, such as that shown in the recorded values of the refractive index
of air, was obviously disturbing, and in 1931 the International Committee on Weights
surements of the refractive index of

and Measures agreed that further precise mei
air were required (Comité int. 1931). It may be pertinent to mention here that
the present authors (1934, p. 181) have already advanced certain tentative proposals
for the adoption of ideal definitions of the units of length in terms of wave-lengths 7
vacuo, rather than wave-lengths in air, but this would not avoid the practical necessity
