More relevant to bio-musicology, homologies often allow us
to make inferences about traits that were present in an ances-
tral species, because a set of homologous traits in a particular
clade are by definition inherited by descent from a common
ancestor of that clade. Often, particularly for behavioural or
cognitive capacities, homology-based phylogenetic inference
is the only means we have of reconstructing these extinct
ancestors, because behavioural traits typically leave no fossils
(fossil footprints providing one exception). For example,
although we will probably never find a fossilized Cretaceous
stem mammal in the act of suckling her young, we can none-
theless infer, with great confidence, that the ancestral
mammal did so from the fact that all living descendants of
this species still do. Thus, a careful analysis of living species,
combined with comparative inference, provides a sort of
‘evolutionary time machine’ to reconstruct the behaviour
and physiology of long-extinct species. Analogous traits serve a different and complementary
purpose: they provide a means for testing hypotheses using
multiple independent data points.
