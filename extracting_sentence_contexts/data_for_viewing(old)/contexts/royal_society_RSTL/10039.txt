THE FROG, AND ON THE ACTION OF THE VAGUS NERVE. 1011

by a series of stimulations in each separate experiment, and, if 80, what conditions are

necessary for its production.

f Tn the first place, sbimulation of the vagus is much more likely to reduce the force
of the contractions down to complete quiescence immediately after removal of the heart
from the body, than after it has been 8uspended for some time ; and, indeed, a variety
of facts can be brought together which all point in one direction, viz. : that the produc-
tion of quiescence by stimulation of the nerve stands in intimate relation with the
existence of a snitable nutrition of the heart. Thus it frequently happens that typical
inhibition can be obtained before the heart is removed from the body, although after

TD it has been suspended ib is impossible by any strength of stimulation to reduce the

a etrength of the contractions to such an extent as to cause standstill.

S Again, experiments made in June for this express purpose show that if the heart be

8uspended as quickly after removal as possible, and the circulation be kept intact till
