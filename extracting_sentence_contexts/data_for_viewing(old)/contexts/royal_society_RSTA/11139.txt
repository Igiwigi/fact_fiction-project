58 MR. S: W. J. SMITH ON THE NATURE OF ELECTROCAPILLARY PHENOMENA,

smaller than the Helmholtz view requires.* If such a view as this were true, the
electrostatic. effect would be insufficient to account for the observed variation in the
surface tension. Assuming the potential difference, the existence of the electrostatic
effect is scarcely open to doubt, it is only the relative importance of the effect that
may be questioned. The electrostatic effect apart, the Helmholtz view assumes
that the nature of the transition from the solution to the mereury is (through a con-
siderable range) independent of the potential difference and of the nature of the
solution.

Several published observations show that there are cases for which this assumption
cannot be true. There are many facts in favour of the view that for a given -
potential difference there is a corresponding condition (of the partly physical, partly
chemical kind, pictured by Warsure) of the space bounded on the one side by the
mercury, and on the other by the sensibly homogeneous solution. Obviously the
surface tension will depend upon the nature of the transition through the surface
layer. The mode of transition may depend only on the chemical nature of the
solution and the potential difference across the space in which the transition takes
place. On this view the electrostatic effect and the mode of transition for a given
solution will be determined by the potential difference, and therefore the surface
tension will be fixed by the potential difference. It remains to determine how the
relation between the surface tension and the potential difference depends upon the
chemical nature and concentration of the solution.
