tion of the distillate which came over below 210? C., and which refused to crystallize, it
appeared to be no pure chemical compound, but simply a mixture of an oily body and
the salt last analysed. This belief was confirmed by noticing its deportment towards
aqueous potash, which precipitated a considerable quantity of white oxide of stanethy],
The solution, on the other hand, with hydrochloric acid liberated the above-mentioned
odorous oil. To isolate this last, the whole was mixed in a mortar with rather strong
aqueous potash, and the magma washed in a funnel plugged with asbestos. The wagh-
ing was continued with weak potash until the rinsings were nearly inodorous.

The liquid was then distilled, a good condensing apparatus being attached. At first
white pungent fumes passed over with the aqueous vapour, and collected in the receiver
in the form of oily drops, possessed of great causticity and powerful basic properties.
This product, in fact, is the aqueous solution of the oxide of an ethylated base contain-
ing tin, from which definite compounds may be obtained with sulphuric, hydrochloric,
and other acids.

As the sulphate is but little soluble in water, it seemed well adapted for fixing the
constituents of the base. A portion of the aqueous solution of the oxide was therefore
nearly neutralized with sulphuric acid, and heated to abont 80? C., when an opake
colourless and crystalline salt appeared, which was dried #72 vacuo over sulphuric acid,
and analysed.
