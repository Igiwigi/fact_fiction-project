The increase in the number of these barred cells as we follow the
course of the ray centrifugally is accompanied by a corresponding increase in its
diameter as 8een in s8nch transverse sections as fig. 7,

Conpa found similar cells in the medullary rays of his Diplozylon eycadeoideum,
as pointed out in my memoir, Part II. ; but he did not distinguish these rays from
foliar bundles, which he believed them all to be. Tangential sections, however, show

clearly that this is a mistake, as is obvious from the fact that even in transverse
sections these rays are s8een to be very much more numerous than the foliar bundles. What gives an interest to this frequent occurrence of barred cells in the medullary
rays of these exogenous Lycopods is the fact pointed out by De Bary (*Vergleichende
Anatomie,” p. 505), thab amongst living plants such cells are chiefly confined to the
medullary rays of Gymnosperms and especially to the Abietina,

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS RESPECTING THE CARBONIFEROUS LYCOPODS. I think T am justified in expressing my conviction that the present memoir confirms
the views I have 80 long advanced, viz. : that at leass many of the Lepidodendroid
plants acquire, through advancing age, those characteristics thab have hitherto been
relied upon to distinguish the Sigillarian from the Lepidodendroid forms.
