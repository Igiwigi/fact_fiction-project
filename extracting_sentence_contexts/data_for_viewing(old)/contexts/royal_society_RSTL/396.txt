compound, it dissolved in it by heat, and did not crystallize
on cooling. By evaporation, a solid white substance was
procured, not s0 easily decomposed by heat as the compound
itself.

The taste of all these acid compounds is very svur, though
in different degrees of intensity : they redden vegetable blues,
and they dissolve gold and platinum. When they are made to
act on the alkalies or earths, or on saline solutions which they
are capable of decomposing, common neutral salts and oxy-
iodes are formed at the same time.

Thz facts of the combination of the new compound with
acids, serve to explain the phenomena of the action of these
substances, on the oxyiodes which I have described in my last
paper on todine, and they confirm the opinions there stated
on the nature of this action. The substance procured by
M. Gay Lossac, by the action of sulphuric acid on the solution
of the oxyiode of barium, and which he has supposed to be a
pure combination of oxygene and iodine mixed with a little sul-
phuric acid, has evidently for its base the combination just now
described of sulphuric acid and the new compound, and, as I
have shown, it likewise contains baryta. However minute
the quantity of sulphuric acid made to act on oxyiodeof barium,
a part of it is always employed to form the compound acid ;
