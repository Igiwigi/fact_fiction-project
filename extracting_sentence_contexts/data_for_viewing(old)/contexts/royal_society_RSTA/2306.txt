(i) Classical bit

To compute the bound of Bs for the case of the classical bit, it is useful to simplify the expression
in order to reduce the number of parameters. We write

Bs = p(01|00) + p(10|10) + p(10|11) = p(0|0) + p(1/1) + p(10|10) — p(00|00) — p(11]11)
= p(0|0) [1 — p(010; 00)] + p11) + p(Ol1; 10) — pt; 11)], (6.19)

where we used first the AoT conditions and the definition of quantities p(a|x) for p(b|a;xy) as in
equations (4.3) and (4.4). By convexity, we can ignore the convex mixture of different machines, i.e.
on yz in equation (5.8), and choose a fixed pure state 7, e.g. xt =(1,0,...,0). Moreover, since we
are limited to sequences of length two, for any strategy, i.e. initial state 7 and transition matrices
{T(a|x)}a,x, one can obtain the same value of Bs with a measure-and-prepare strategy. In fact, T(a|x)
can be substitute with the measurement of the effect vector fa) = T(a|x)n and a preparation of the
state m*T(a|x)/(2*falx). The expression can, then, be further simplified to depend quadratically
only on two parameters, corresponding to the effect fojo and finally solved analytically (cf. the
study of Budroni et al. [17] for details). We obtain

Qrit = F- (5.20)

Moreover, an optimal machine is given by the initial state xt* = (1,0) and the transition matrices
