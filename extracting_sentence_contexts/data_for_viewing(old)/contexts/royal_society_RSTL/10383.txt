VALUE OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION UNIT OF RESISTANCE. 297

—=— y. The quantity = thus takes the place of R in the
smple formula, and is called the effective resistance. By taking for instance a=3,
b=1, c=100, we get an effective resistance of about 44g; and the registances
employed may be those of ordinary resistance coils, capable of accurate comparison
with the standards,

$ 4. In designing the apparatus we were influenced by the fact that we had at our
disposal two very suitable coils of large radius, wound 80me years ago by Professor

CanvsraL, the same in fact as were used by Mr. GLazEBROOK in his investigation by

another method. By bringing the two coils close to one another and to the plane of

Q the disc, the inductive effect is rendered a maximum. This arrangement accordingly

was the one firs} experimented with, as being the most likely to prove successful.

E The diameter of the disc is limited by two considerations. If it be too small, the
