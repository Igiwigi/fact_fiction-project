trariwise, that oxygene‚Äù and acid substances are attracted by
positively electrified metallic surfaces, and repelled by nega-
tively electrified metallic surfaces; and these attractive and re-
pulsive forces are sufficiently energetic to destroy or suspend
the usual operation of elective affinity.

It is very natural to suppose, that the repellent and attrac-
tive energies are communicated from one particle to another
particle of the same kind, s0 as to establish a conducting chain
in the fluid ; and that the locomotion takes place in conse-
quence; and that this is really the case seems to be shown by
many. facts. Thus, in all the instances in which I exa-
mined alkaline solutions through which acids had'been trans-
mitted, I always found acid in them whenever any acid matter
remained at the: original source. In time, by the attractive
power of the positive surface, the decomposition and transfer
undoubtedly become complete ; but this does not affect the
conclusion.

In the cases of the separation of the constituents of water,
and of solutions of neutral salts forming the whole of the
chain, there may possibly be a succession of decompositions
and recompositions throughout the fluid. And this idea is
strengthened by the experiments on the attempt to pass ba-
