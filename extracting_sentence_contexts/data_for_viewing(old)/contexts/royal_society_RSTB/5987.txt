forming a wall of sete which retain the food particles in the space between the limb
rows. Considering only these endites on the forward stroke of the limbs, fig. 10, limbs
3-6, particles carried on the water and sucked into the inter-limb spaces will be filtered
off by the filter sete. On the backstroke, fig. 10, limbs 1 and 2, the particles so retained
on the more distal sete will be blown off again into the middle space. Particles not
dislodged in this way, that is, the residue carried on the more proximal sets, and any
stray particles remaining adherent to the more distal sete will be combed off by the
armature of comb setules. For the sete distal to about the middle point of the second
endite, the corresponding comb setules occur on the second and following endites of
the limb behind. For the sete of the proximal half of the second endite the comb
setules are represented by the row of stout setules on the claw ridge of the gnathobase
behind. That this is the method of functioning of these setules is supported by the
fact that on the first trunk limb, which is, of course, not overlapped by filter sete, the
comb setules have practically disappeared (see above, para. 2). The comb setules for
the fifth trunk limb occur as a row of stout setules on the gnathobase of the sixth limb

and as a mat of finer setules which extends up the endite lobe.

The food particles having been retained from the water-currents in this manner will

be sucked towards the mid-ventral groove. Here again, as in Chirocephalus, is the
region where true filtration occurs and where food particles are ultimately deposited
