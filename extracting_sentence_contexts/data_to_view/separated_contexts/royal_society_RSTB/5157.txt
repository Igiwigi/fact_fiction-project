Thus, in the case of Swnbucus nigra, of which a large number of
determinations were made, the stomatal frequency ranged from, 12 to 260 per sq. mm.,
a difference of over twenty-one times. The stomatal indices for these same leaves,
however, show a difference of less than four times. Or again, for Seilla nulans the
stomatal range is from 10 to 99, or nearly ten times, whilst the stomatal indices show
a range of less than three times, and this, despite the fact that the plants examined
grew under the most diverse conditions. 64 E. J. SALISBURY ON THE CAUSES AND ECOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF

Summary and Conclusions. It has been shown in the foregoing account that the number of stomata per unit area
of the leaf surface is extremely variable, even upon the same leaf.
