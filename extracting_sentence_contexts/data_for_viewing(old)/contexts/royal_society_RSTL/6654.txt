MR. HOPKINS ON THE THEORY OF THE MOTION OF GLACTERS. 745

« Quite the contrary. The only influence to be looked for from the colloidal state would
be greater elasticity—that is, the matter would be likely to yield more before rending or
breaking, supposing it to be colloidal, than if it were crystalline. Your mechanical con-
*ception of the modus operand: in the fracture of a solid (not plastic) applies equally well
to a erystal or colloid. I go entirely with you up to that point.”

Mr. Granan further remarks, © Colloidality is invoked chiefly with the view of account-
ing for the ready reunion, the redintegration as I have called it, of fragments of ice
brought into contact with each other. It is a very general (perhaps universal) character
of colloids to adhere and reunite when two masses are pressed together. In fact all our
adhesive substances, gum, glue, starch, &c., belong to the class of colloids. Even glass,
which is a colloid of fusion, shows the adhesive character, two sheets of polished plate
glass often adhering s0 thoroughly as to tear up each other's surface when forcibly sepa-
rated. Another colloid adhesive like ice, is fused phosphoric acid—- glacial * phosphoric
acid as it is called, in prescience, one might imagine, of this discussion ! No such adhe-
8ive property is ever found in crystalline surfaces, 0 far as I am aware. Tt is gu@ colloid
that ice appears to be adhesive. The discovery of Farapar's, of the adhesive quality of
ice, is the fundamental fact of the glacier discussion, The name *regelation ' applied
to it may, however, be objected to, being quite speculative, and implying, as it appears
to do, that two pieces of ice come to be cemented together by the freezing of a film of
water between them, instead of simply adhering perfectly and uniting as two pieces of
plate glass might do. The great fact, however, remains, and the name is but a trivial
