vides the framework for much more detailed examination
of the key features of Pentapetalae. Although we have
emphasized the pentamerous, whorled flower of Penta-
petalae, other complex floral features, such as bilateral
symmetry and highly synorganized flowers (with closely
associated floral organs, arising through either fusion or special
physical placement of floral parts) also originated within Penta-
petalae, perhaps built on the genetic diversity residing in these
gamma-derived genomes. Further, because WGD is a common
feature of angiosperm evolution, WGDs that both preceded
and followed gamma may also have contributed to floral diver-
sity in Pentapetalae. The effects of ancient WGD may not be
immediately manifested on a phylogenetic tree; in fact, a phylo-
genetic ‘lag’ often occurs between WGD and the diversification
that may be related to a key innovation [34,137]. Finally,
although we focus here on floral traits, we note that other
novel features, such as the chemical compound ellagic acid,
also trace to Gunneridae or Pentapetalae [49], and further inves-
tigation of gamma will have implications for our understanding
of many of the key traits that characterize nearly 75% of all
angiosperm species.

The vast majority of flowering plant diversity can be attribu-
