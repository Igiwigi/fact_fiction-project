the two posterior milk-molars (m.m. 3 and 4) are in wear, while the second milk-
molar (m.m. 2) is represented by its alveolus. The first true molar (m. 1) is also
in wear while the crown of the uncut second molar lies in the jaw behind. The
germs of the third and fourth premolars (pm. 3 and 4) are found in the jaw
beneath the milk teeth which they are about to replace. The incisors are of great
interest ; in general form they are similar to those of the adult, but their outer edges
bear a number of serrations like those described as occurring in the incisors of the
imperfect mandible which was made the type of Phiomia serridens, ANDREews and

founded on the lower milk-dentition of a species of Palwomastodon, as in fact has
