After
the mass redistribution process the flag of emptied /filled interface cells has to be updated before
starting a new time-step. It is worth noting that through the mass redistribution subroutine the
mass can be conserved over time. In fact, in the case of an emptied cell, characterized by a
mass value slightly below 0, mass contribution is ‘absorbed’ from neighbour fluid/interface cell,
according to the weighting procedure described above. Similarly, in the case of a filled cell, with
a small excess of mass, this is spread to the surrounding cells. The basic principles of free-surface
algorithm are synthetically depicted in figure 2.

(d) Porous media modelling approach

In this work, the porous medium generation is based on the random packing spheres approach
proposed by Al-Raoush & Alsaleh [38] and already analysed for thermal simulations in [69].
