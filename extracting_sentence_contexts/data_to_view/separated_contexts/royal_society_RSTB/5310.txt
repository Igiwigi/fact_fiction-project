It would be more apt, perhaps, to compare the
appearance of the bundle in the median region of the petiole to a double pick-axe
head rather than to an anchor, in the case of Ankyropteris corrugata, since the inward
flexure of the antennse towards the sagittal plane is relatively slight compared with
that of A. westphaliensis. The latter species also differs in the much greater abaxial
curvature of the central bar, this in our species being relatively slight. Both
species resemble one another, however, in the fact that the abaxial antenne are
invariably shorter than the adaxial ones. There appear to be two extreme varieties of petiolar strand, one of which has a
relatively stout central bar with an abaxial curvature which is extremely slight (Plate 9,
fig. 26)
