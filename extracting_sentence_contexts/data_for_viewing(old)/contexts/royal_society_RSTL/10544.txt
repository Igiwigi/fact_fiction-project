Absence or Predominance of Certain Species. —When in the discussion of the Par-
ticular plants we speak of their absence from, or of their being driven out from, par-
ticular plots, our language must not be interpreted too strictly. Such statements,
though based on careful observation on the plots during growth, and on botanical
analysis of zamples, are of necessity approximately correct only, for it can hardly be
imagined, that in all cases of disappearance the plants are absolutely banished from

S the plot, either by the direct action of manures or by internecine conflict. They
amay be present, but in swch diminished numbers, or in snch limited growth, that
Ethey are nob obvious on the plots at the times when the observations are made,
Sand till less are they found in the samples. That this may be the case is shown by
Sthe fact that when cireumstances become favonrable they again appear. As has been
Said, many of the plants on the plots seldom, if ever, ripen their seed. The reappear-
ance of such plants after an interval is nob likely, therefore, to be due to the transport
Af seed. Tt is more probable that the root-stocks of such plants have all along existed
Son the plots, but, owing to unfavourable cireumstances, have not been able to develop
Sthemselves. Some plants, ib is well known—e.g., some of the Orchids—have the
wer of maintaining an underground existence for several years, producing at most
:Sonly a few minute leaves, and no flowers at all ; 80 that their presence is not snspected
Still at length, in a favourable season, flowers are produced freely, and hundreds may
Sho seen where the year before not one was observed. Such cases are familiar to
Sbotanists.

<=congenital—.e., ancestral, or physiological and adaptive. The former which are more
