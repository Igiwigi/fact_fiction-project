109. Fach of the lines (X—W=0, Y+Z=0) and (X+W=0, Y—Z=0) is a double
tangent of the spinode octic ; in fact for the first of these lines we have
164+84+169%+5=0, 1645+16#+49=0,
that is,
(2 +1Y(4—4f+5)=0, 4024+1)*=0,
80 that the line touches at the two points given by 2. +1=0; and similarly the other
line touches at the two points given by 2P—1=0. The edge X=0, Z=0 has apparently a higher contact with the spinode octic, viz.
