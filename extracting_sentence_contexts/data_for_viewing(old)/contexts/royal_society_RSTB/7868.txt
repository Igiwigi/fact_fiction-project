electronic taxonomy; bacterial systematics

1. INTRODUCTION In this article, we examine whether sequences can be
used to resolve clusters of related genotypes among
large populations of similar bacteria. The focus is not
on theoretical considerations, but on the practical issue
of whether gene sequences can inform the process by
which closely related bacteria are assigned to species,
and the prospects for an electronic taxonomy in which
To many microbiologists, bacterial species are real bacterial strains can be assigned to species on the
