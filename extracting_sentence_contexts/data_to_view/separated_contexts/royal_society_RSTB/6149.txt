This may or may not be the “dominant black” of the varietal crosses. With
respect to several of the remaining seven factors, I have learnt, since the experiment
was commenced, that in the opinion of other geneticists their claim to be regarded
as good dominants in varietal crosses is not so good as had been previously repre-
sented. In no case, however, where it is claimed that the heterozygote can be
distinguished from the homozygous mutant, does it appear that use has been
made of this fact in linkage studies, for which such a discrimination, if it could be
relied on, would be most valuable. Such a conflict of evidence and opinion is
only what is to be expected if the dominance manifested by domesticated breeds
had been brought about in their ancestors by human selection, for we should not
expect to find, in a breed in which a certain peculiarity is absent, those modifying
factors which would favour its dominance, unless this breed had been derived
from one exhibiting the characteristic. Since the subject has been regarded as
controversial, and since with increasing information the ground of controversy
may be thought to change, I may quote a statement of the point of view from which
the experiment was initiated from a book (Fisuer, 1930, a) published in 1930.

“Tt may be mentioned that my inference concerning the modification of domin-
ance in mutant factors in the fowl, is open to the crucial test of introducing
one or more of these dominants into a genuinely wild strain of jungle fowl.
