i attributed the diminution ,of air by the calcination of
7 metals, to the conyerſion of the dephlogifticated part of com-

2 mon air into fixed air, by reaſon of its union with the phlo-
2 iſton of the metal, for this p ain reaſon, becauſe I find it, ac-
Z knowledged on all hands, that the calces of all the baſe metals
5 yield fixed air, when ſufficiently heated. Mr, Cayendiſh allows
S the fact in-general, but aſcribes the fixed air found in them to
SZ their long expoſure to the atmoſphere, in which he fays fixed
Z air pre-exiſts ;. but that it exiſts in common air in any quantity
5 worth, attending to, or. is extrafted from it in any degree, I
A take the liberty of denying, grounded on the following Hats.
Firſt, I have frequently agitated 18 cubic inches of common air

in 2 of lime-water, and 2, of common. air in 18, of lime-water,
but could never perceive the flighteſt milkineſs ; and yet the
 thouſandth part of a cubic inch of fixed air would thus be made
* ſenſible; for if a cubic inch of it be diflolved in 3 ounces o

; a 25" water,
