From this model, and by neglecting interactions of order higher than two, the slope of the regression b; between the fitness
effect of mutation i (AFi) and the fitness of its genetic background (Fg) can be approximated as [49]:

whereas the intercept of the regression takes the form a; = (AF) — b;(Fg). According to the equation above, the sign of the
slope b; will be thus given by the sign of 375; fi(fi — fij)- =
The slope of the regression can also be written in terms of the fitness values of every genotype F(x1, X2,...) instead of the =

interaction parameters (fj, fij, fijk,-..)- After some basic algebraic manipulations, and using the fact that: fj = (e;)/4 and 3
(fi — fiz) = (8F;) p/2 [49], one finds that the slope of the regression between AF; and Fs can be written as: >

where (&;) denotes the average pairwise epistasis between mutations i and j over every background where this pair may be &
added (e.g. for a landscape containing just two mutations, 1 and 2, e12 = Fi2 — Fi — Fz + Fo), and (6F;) py Aenotes the average S
fitness effect of mutation j over the set of all genetic backgrounds where the focal mutation i may be added (which we have al

denoted as B(i)).
The equation above can be written as
