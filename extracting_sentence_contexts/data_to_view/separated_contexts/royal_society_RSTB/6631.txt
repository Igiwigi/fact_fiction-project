This continued downgrowth
would involve an enormous accumulation of cells in the mid-line unless extensive
degeneration took place in this region. It would seem, therefore, that when the down-
growing tissues from either side meet in the mid-line, the median cells degenerate,
thus forming the necrotic band described above, while more cells move down to take
their place, like fresh troops being moved into the line of battle. The generalized nature
of the degenerative process is shown by the fact that it begins well in front of the
sternum and ends some distance behind it at the level of the yolk-stalk. It is not
peculiar to the budgerigar, and has also been observed by the writer in the embryonic
fowl and sparrow. DEVELOPMENTAL MECHANICS OF THE AVIAN STERNUM = 423

The degenerative changes in the epidermis of the mid-line have now spread back-
wards as far as the yolk-stalk.
