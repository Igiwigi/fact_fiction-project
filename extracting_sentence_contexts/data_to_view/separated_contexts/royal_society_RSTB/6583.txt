After one egg is deposited usually a second and sometimes a third is laid
immediately through the same puncture in the host chorion without the ovipositor
being sheathed. In laboratory experiments hosts containing two parasite eggs were
more common than those containing one or three. Although superparasitism with a
partial survival may occur, the facts indicate that the oviposition response is in some way
related to the quantity of host material present, and accords with the above theory. This interpretation of the behaviour is a special application of the general principle
noted by Thompson and Parker (1927) to the effect that the number of eggs deposited
by a parasite in a host is roughly proportional to the amount of food material available. In the present instance, however, it seems essential to introduce some conception of
the quality of the food material available, for the differences in quantity of host material
or movements of parasite stages between host types which are unparasitized, parasitized
with a parasite egg, and parasitized with an early larva, are so small that, taken singly
or together, one cannot see how they are perceptible, but considered as parts related
to a whole they function in helping the female to determine the nature of the host.
