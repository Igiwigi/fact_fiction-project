Comparisons with species other than A. afarensis, P. robustus
and A. africanus could not be undertaken using Mahalanobis’
distances because each is only represented by a single specimen.

Caution is due in interpreting the species comparisons in
the Mahalonobis’ distance tests, because of the inevitable
small sample sizes which may not fully capture intraspecific
variation. Spoor et al. [1] made comparisons with much larger
samples of modern humans, chimpanzees and gorillas and
found that the fossil samples used here do show representative
levels of intraspecific morphological variation. Statistical tests
take sample size into account and those employed here are con-
servative in nature. Hence, the fact that statistical significance is
obtained for small samples suggests that the observed differ-
ences are substantial. Moreover, it is reassuring to note that
the pattern of statistically significant differences fits well with
the relationships among fossils in the PCA (figures 2-4), and
with the Procrustes distances (table 2).

A potential bias in the comparisons of BRT-VP-3/1 could
result from its likely status as a subadult [9]. When examining
the maxillary shape of KNM-WT 40000 the presence of five
subadults in the comparative sample was found to have no
impact on the results [1]. However, BRT-VP-3/1 is character-
ized by different morphological features, and developmental
