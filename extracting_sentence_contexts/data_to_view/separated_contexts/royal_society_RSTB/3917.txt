(2) That the differences between observed dissociation curves of hemoglobin and
blood can be explained on the assumption that the molecules of hemoglobin can
exist in various states of aggregation. (3) That the effect of slight changes in reaction is to alter the equilibrium constant
of the reaction, with but little change in the state of assumed aggregation of the

molecules. Of the two formule which have been put forward to express the facts (those of
J. B. 8. Hanpane and A. V. Hitt) my reasons for preferring that of H1n1 are given
in another place. *
