where the food supply is ordinarily conceded to be greatest, that is, in the bast. The
facts, however, are the reverse. The stimulus produces a result only in the ray cells
of the bast, the sieve tube initials and other bast elements proper not being affected,

t It is just possible that the stimulus acts on the young products on the tracheary side of the cambium,
our reason for stating this being the fact that we have just recently found that formic acid when inserted
into a wound travels far up the tissues, evidently in the upward current in the wood, and results in
production of resin canals many times farther above the seat of injury than below it. However, the
stimulus does produce a result on both sides of the cambium, and our conclusion holds independently
of this debatable feature, which has, however, a very distinct bearing on the “damming up’ theory,
probably being the true explanation of the greater response above than below.

while, on the other hand, in the wood it affects the tracheary as well as the medullary
ray cell initials, resulting in two distinct types of resin structure, that of the horizontal
and that of the vertical series. One would think that even if the sieve tubes were
