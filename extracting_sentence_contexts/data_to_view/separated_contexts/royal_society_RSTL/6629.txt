J The evidence afforded by the numerical results in the Table XII. relating to this
Zplant is not of 80 decisive a character as that with regard to the cereals, or even to the
ZLeguminous plants; for the quantity of dry matter in the produced plants is less than
that in the seed sown, whilst the Nitrogen in the plants is little more than one-third
that of the seed. But when we come to compare the results of the experiments with
Buckwheat grown with and without the snpply of ammonia, it will be found that the
physiological evidence of the dependence of vegetable growth upon a constant supply of
combined Nitrogen is stronger in the case of these plants than in that of the cereals,
The mall proportion of the total Nitrogen of the seeds which the buckwheat seemed
capable of appropriating might lead to the inference that, ceasing to grow with an
abundance of combined Nitrogen apparently at its disposal, it had done 80. for -80me
other reason than the want of available Nitrogen. But this question was set. at rest by
the fact that, on the addition of an amount of ammonia very small in its contents of
