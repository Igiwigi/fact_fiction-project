The kinetic energy spectrum of horizontal bright-point motions is
continuous in frequency space (e.g. [12,25]), but it does not necessarily show the power-
law behaviour expected from an active cascade. Time-dependent MHD simulations of the
chromosphere and corona (see §3) typically do not need there to be fully turbulent motions
injected at the lower boundary, since a rapid cascade develops naturally above the photosphere. However, it is difficult to avoid the fact that the deep convection zone—host to the highly
nonlinear solar dynamo—must be strongly turbulent [26]. Observations of the spatial diffusion
of magnetic elements in the photosphere also show statistical properties similar to those seen
in simulations of turbulent diffusion [14,27]. Further elucidation will likely come from the next
generation of high-resolution solar observations, such as the Daniel K.
