intact frog, only its utricular macule stand to be stimulated. The kind of skeletal
adjustment then elicited is, however, like that which the canals themselves would
have brought about, had the angular acceleration been greater. When the rate
of tilting comes well within the range in which canal stimulation would occur, the
utricular macule enter into action in a new way, their reflex effect being now
antagonistic to that of the canals. Thus we see that under conditions of quick tilt
in the intact animal the canals and the utricular macule work in some form of
complementary association.

As to the bodily adjustments due to pure macular stimulation under conditions
of rapid tilt, there is little need to go into detail, for McNatty and Tarr (1933),
in reporting the behaviour of animals with lesions of the vertical canals, have in
effect stated the outstanding facts. Removal of any particular vertical canal merely
uncovers (to a rapid tilting test) the real action of the utricular macula. In other
words, all the “ disabilities *’ now observed are positive effects of utricular stimulation.
It will be made plain, too, in the sequel that if a bisoliutricular frog, on rapid tilting
in one particular direction, exhibits a certain complex reaction, precisely the same
reaction is evoked by canalicular stimulation, provided merely that the direction of
rapid tilt is reversed.

We previously concluded that the response of the utricular receptors cannot well
depend on any mere slip or “ downhill ” displacement of their otoliths relative to
