When the soldering

has been effected the tail-piece of the spiral is pulled down and out through the hole

Sat b, and when all other arrangements are completed is soldered in its place. Pre-

Eviously to this, however, the glass piece e is put into its place with an extremely

‘2minute quantity of “siegelwachs”; and then, with the help of a pointed glass rod, heated

2in a spirit lamp, the cement is put in drops round the junction of copper and glass,

gand carefully worked in so as to fill up every re-entrant corner, and make a coating
everywhere convex outward except just where it joins the vertical part of the glass

Stube. Here the wax is thinned away very gradually, the greatest care being taken

gto make sure that all round the edges the cement is adhering perfectly to the glass.

& With a joint made as described I have maintained a high vacuum for weeks together ;

Sand, in fact, 1 have no reason for thinking that such a joint is not quite as good at

8 atmospheric temperature as the usual joint made by fusion of glass on to the exhausting
tube of the SpRENGEL pump. A itis unnecessary for me to enter into details as to the production of high vacuums
by means of the Sprencen pump. In this matter the splendid researches of Mr.
