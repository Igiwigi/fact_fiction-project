Obviously, by
definition and mathematically speaking, reactionâ€”diffusion equations comprise chemical and
diffusion terms. But, physically speaking, concluding from this evidence that chemistry and
diffusion are coupled irreversible processes is sloppy language. It should best be avoided
because it nullifies the fact that the Curie theorem applies and affirms that such coupling is
physically impossible in the system considered. One has to remember that this theorem is a
most important piece of the puzzle assembled by Prigogine in his thesis. Postulating, as he did
at that time, that this theorem established in 1894 in connection with equilibrium phenomena
needs to be incorporated in the formulation of non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a conceptual : =
breakthrough.
