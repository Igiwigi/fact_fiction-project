e is another source of possible error to tbe mentioned. I cannot do away
in degree of internal reflection from the inner surfaces of the glass and
es, and it is quite possible that a slight amount of over-lapping of the
vs at the boundaries. We shall see that with long exposures to the very
ic-are spectrum, this internal reflection becomes very marked indeed.
although I used as narrow a slit as possible, in working with the solar-
T had to open it to at least 1 millim., and it is not improbable that this

rtainly of opinion that in fig. 14 the action appears to extend further into
n than is really the case, and that this is due to one or more of the causes
to, and especially to the fact that the spectrum was not quite pure.

Experiments with the Light of the Electric-are.

Da number of abortive attempts* to obtain results by exposing plates to the

i LopaE, and it is to his cordial and sympathetic aid, in having my plates
& to the spectrum in his laboratory, that I owe the remarkable success now
