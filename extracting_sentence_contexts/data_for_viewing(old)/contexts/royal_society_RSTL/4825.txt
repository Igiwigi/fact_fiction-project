It now remained only to submit the new base again to the action of iodide of ethyl.
An experiment on a small scale showed that the two compounds do not fail to act
promptly upon one another, The mixture, after an hour's ebullition in a sealed tube,
$olidified into a beautiful erystalline mass. In order to obtain a precise notion of this
reaction, I repeated this experiment upon a grand scale. Two ounces of iodide of
tetrethylammonium were caustified by protoxide of silyer, and then submitted to the
action of about half a pound of iodide of ethyl. The mixture was kept boiling in a
glass flask, provided with a long tube, in which the volatilized substances were con-
densed and returned to the seat of the reaction. During the whole process not a trace
of permanent gas was disengaged. After a day's ebullition the solution had become
neutral, and deposited on cooling magnificent crystals of iodide of tetrethylammonium,
which were identified by analysis. In fact, for the determinations III. and V., men-
tioned at the analysis of the platinum-compound, the salts had been prepared with
the base obtained in this manner. On submitting the mother-liquor of the crystals
to distillation in such a manner as to collect only the most volatile products, a con-
siderable amount of perfectly pure alcohol was obtained, which was identified by a
careful comparison of all its properties. The action of iodide of ethyl upon oxide
of tetrethylammonium is therefore represented by the following equation—
