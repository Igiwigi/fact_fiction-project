The uvula has no relation
to any part of the cerebellar hemispheres. The Seventh Nerveâ€”The facialis nucleus of Echidna is usually described as comprising
separate dorsal and ventral parts as in the Sauropsida. There is, in fact, only one
facialis nucleus. This is very large and extends caudally almost to the anterior
pole of the nucleus ambiguus ; frontally it reaches the level of maximum develop-
ment of the fifth motor nucleus, fig. 13.
