past ! On the contrary, it is one of several genera characterized by the fact that the
“spines” (growth-segments) of the septa are more or less unattached both in a
longitudinal and in a horizontal direction, About the middle of the septum the
tendency is for the spines to be compacted, but centrally and often peripherally the
tendency is for them to be freer. Lateral coalescence of the septal surfaces occurs
frequently. Besides, these genera show frequent signs of bilaterality. Such genera
are Dermosmulia, Kony ;* Baryphyllia, Kony ; Haplarea, MitascnEwitz.

A moment’s consideration will suffice to show that this Triassic and Jurassic series
of genera leads to the family of Eupsammide, destined to play a very important réle
in the next following Cretaceous and later time. The Table of Classification (antea,
Part L.) points out that the unfilled apertures left in the septa of the Eupsammide,
and very often also in the Lophosering, are due to incoherence of the “septal spines”
