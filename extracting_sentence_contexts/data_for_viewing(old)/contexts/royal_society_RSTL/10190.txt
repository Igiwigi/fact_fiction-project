In one direction we have the well-marked group of the Pennatulida. This group
probably sprang from the ancestral stock at a very remote period, as is shown by the
changes which have taken place in the central polyp, the arrangement of the
gubsequently formed polyps upon it, and the complete and universal dimorphism of

the colonies. In another direction arose the ancient group of which ZZeliopor is a
gurvival. This group, which was formerly placed amongst the Tabulata, was probably
very rich in genera and species in palzozoic times, but it is gradually becoming extinct.
Tn another direction arose the modern genus Alcyonium and its numerous allies.
This genus differs from the ancestral form @ chiefly in the fact that the polyps are
capable of being retracted within the sarcosoma, but in other respects is probably
more closely related to ib than any other genera. The fact that the polyps are
capable of being retracted is not one of very great importance, for we find both in
this family and in the Gorgonide, that nearly allied genera differ frora one another
in this respect. The dimorphic genus, Sarcophyton, is probably closely related to
Aleyonium. The presence of dimorphism is not sufficient to warrant the gupposition
> that they sprang from different stocks, for this condition occurs in 80 many widely
5 different genera that it is reasonable to suppose that it was introduced more than
b=0 onee in the course of the evolution of the group.
'S As an example of this we find that the genus Xenia, which probably followed
5 another line of evolution from the hypothetical ancestor, is not dimorphic, whereas the
& genus Zeterozenia, very gsimilar to it in other respects, is dimorphic.
