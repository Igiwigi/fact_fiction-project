If both the growth rate of an apex as a whole and the plasto-
chrone remain constant, while the central bare area increases from a previously fixed size
until it reaches another at which it again becomes stable, the phyllotaxis index during the
change must first rise from its initial value to a higher one and finally fall again to the original
value. The change in size of the apex will have had a temporary effect on phyllotaxis
(while it was occurring), but no permanent effect. In fact, however, the height of phyllo-
taxis is known usually to be correlated with size of apex, hence it appears inevitable that,
when the bare portion increases in diameter, either the growth rate of the apex as a whole,
or else the plastochrone, must normally diminish. Presumably the dominant effect is on
the plastochrone, and indeed such a change may almost be regarded as automatic, as the
following considerations show. Whatever may be the immediate causes of the absolute distancing of the primordia from
one another at initiation, assume that they do not change while the radius of the bare
portion of the apex producing them increases from R, to R,; provided that full contact is
maintained among the primordia, this is tantamount to the assumption that their absolute
size at initiation does not alter with that of the bare region of the apex.
