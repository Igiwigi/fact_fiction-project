The evolution of eyes and visually
guided behaviour

The morphology and molecular mechanisms of animal photoreceptor cells and eyes reveal a
complex pattern of duplications and co-option of genetic modules, leading to a number of different
light-sensitive systems that share many components, in which clear-cut homologies are rare. On the
basis of molecular and morphological findings, I discuss the functional requirements for vision and
how these have constrained the evolution of eyes. The fact that natural selection on eyes acts
through the consequences of visually guided behaviour leads to a concept of task-punctuated
evolution, where sensory systems evolve by a sequential acquisition of sensory tasks. I identify
four key innovations that, one after the other, paved the way for the evolution of efficient eyes. These innovations are (i) efficient photopigments, (ii) directionality through screening pigment,
(iii) photoreceptor membrane folding, and (iv) focusing optics.
