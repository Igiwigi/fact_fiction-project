Concentrated sulphuric acid, which is a much more perfect
conductor, is equally inefficient, for it has little action upon
zinc, and is itself decomposed only by a very strong power. Piles, containing as their fluid element either pure water or
sulphuric acid, will undoubtedly give single shocks, and this
effect is connected with the restoration of the equilibrium dis-
turbed by the energies of the metals; but when their extreme
plates are connected there is no exhibition, as in usual cases
of electromotion. Water containing loosely combined oxygene
is more efficient than water containing common air, as it enables
