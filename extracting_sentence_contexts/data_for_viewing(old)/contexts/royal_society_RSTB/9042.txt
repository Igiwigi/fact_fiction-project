Cryptic LR defects (right isomerism and heterotaxia) Gaio et al. [44] and Yan et al. [45] °
Cripto, Cryptic resembles Nodal~/~; defects in Epi, ExE and AVE Chu et al. [46]
Gdfl LR defects (resembles Cryptic /~) Rankin et al. [47] and Andersson et al. [48]
GdfB AVE defects; ME defects Chen et al. [49]
FoxH1 no anterior PS and its derivatives Hoodless et al. [50]
Smad2 Epi converted into ExE; no AVE; early patterning defects Waldrip et al. [51], Heyer et al. [52] and Brennan et al. [34]
Smad3 get born; subtle developmental anomalies Zhu et al. [53], Datto et al. [54] and Yang et al. [55]
Smad2/3 resembles Smad4_/~; very small; fail to gastrulate Dunn et al. [56]
and lack ME
Smad4 very small; fail to gastrulate Sirard et al. [57]
