It is difficult to obtain a hundred individuals with like environment ; soil,
position with regard to other growths, sunlight, insect life, &c., may differ in a manner
that the collector cannot appreciate. Unlike environment may produce a fictitious
likeness in the organs of the same individual when we pass from one individual to a
second. The fact that half our series grew in one field, the other half in another,
that part came from one side of a road, part from another, may introduce an unper-
ceived heterogeneity which increases the apparent homotyposis. Thirdly, the
difficulty of ensuring that all individuals are of the same age or in the same stage
of development, is very great. The leaves of an old tree may have a fictitious
likeness when compared with those of a young tree ; we may gather organs from one
individual when it is in a stage of development, which would only be reached in
another individual some days or weeks later.
