Thus,
development of life prediction models in Ni-base alloys must be based on the underlying physics
of the damage process, which can be quite different for different alloys and/or heat treatments. These points are amply illustrated in various studies that have shown, depending on the alloy
system, the following damage modes and interactions:

— Twinning [83-85] and oxidation.
— Recrystallization, twinning slip bands and oxidation [86]. In fact, these authors state an
essential feature of TMF [86, p. 357]:

‘... deformation and damage mechanisms occurring during TMF are rather different from
those traditionally reported for creep or isothermal fatigue. In all cases examined, the


deformation is localized within a rather small number of deformation bands. While these
bands were found to consist mainly of micro-twins in some alloys, in others they might be
better described as slip or shear bands.
