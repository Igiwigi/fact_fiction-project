then the simplified ith Sturmian residue R; may be expressed under the form

which is easily identifiable with the known expression for such residue.

Now obviously the necessary and sufficient conditions in order that the » roots
may consist of only repetitions of 4 distinct roots is, that R, shall be identically zero,
that is to 8ay, we must have

But the reasoning of the preceding article shows that although these equations are
necessary and sufficient, they are but a selected s8ystem of equations of an infinite
number of similar equations whici subsist#, and taat, in fact, whatever be the value
of (1), we may take 7, 74...7; perfectly arbitrary and as great as we please, and the
equation
D

must exist by virtue of the existence of the n—z equations last above written.

Art. (4.) I now return to the question of expressing the successive quotients of 7!
