It was generally found that
the electrode in contact with the blood was positive, but not always ; sometimes vibra-
tions of the needle only occurred, at other times the needle went as far as 80? or 90?
and then stopped. The motions of the needle presented quite a different character
to those observed when the bile in the gall-bladder and the blood flowing from the
vena cava inferior were formed into a circuit; the latter presented a steady character,
they could be depended upon ; whereas with the former a greater effect might be pro-
duced at first, and it would then cease, or perhaps go in the opposite direction. The following fact may not perhaps be denied, viz. that when the electrodes of a
galvanometer are brought into contact with the bile flowing from the liver and with
