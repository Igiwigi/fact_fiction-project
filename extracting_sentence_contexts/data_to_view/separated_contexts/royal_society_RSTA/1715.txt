Tue problem which gives its title to the present paper has been handled by various
writers, notably by Lord Rayzeren, Sir J. J. Tuomson, and Prof. Love. In most
cases the solutions have been expressed in a Cartesian form; but it appears to me
that a marked simplification is introduced by using spherical polar co-ordinates. The
preliminary analysis becomes shorter, and the conclusions are easier to interpret ; in
fact, the analysis is nearly as simple as in the analogous problem of electrostatics,
when an electric field is disturbed by the presence of a dielectric sphere. To obtain the requisite solutions a new general solution of the electromagnetic
equations in Cartesian form is given in § 1, and is then transformed to the spherical
polar form; §§ 2, 3 contain a summary of certain analytical results required in the
sequel,

§4 contains the general solution of the problem of finding the scattered waves
when a plane simple harmonic wave strikes a sphere; and in §5 the solution is
applied to the case of a small sphere. These formule (all of § 4 and part of § 5) were
originally worked out in 1899, but publication was postponed in the hope of
completing the problem of the large sphere.
