The problem of the dorsum selle is complicated by the question of the age of the
embryos studied, and by the fact that in some forms (Man, Semnopithecus, Macacus,
Lepus, and Felis) there is an additional independently chondrifying structure, which
co-operates with the anterior edge of the basal plate in its formation. Until further
evidence is obtained, it is impossible to say which of these two elements corresponds
to the crista sellaris of reptiles, the prootic bridge of fish, and the acrochordal of
Selachians. At all events, the dorsum selle as a whole agrees well with the crista
sellaris of the lizard, for example, in that its lateral extremities are continuous with
the roots of the pilee antotice:, or their mammalian homologues the teeniz clino-orbitales,
and the posterior clinoid processes, which in Semnopithecus almost, and in Sus
completely, enclose the abducens nerve in a cartilaginous canal. In Lacerta, a
comparable canal is present at the root of the pila antotica.
