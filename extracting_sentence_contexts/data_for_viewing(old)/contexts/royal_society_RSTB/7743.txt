Tt must be apparent, however, from what I have already written, that the Wolston Series
of my mapping is only a small part of the original extent of these lake deposits. Going
southwards we may still note, despite the great loss of evidence caused by the Avon’s

erosion, the laminated clays and stoneless clays of Snitterfield, Welcombe and perhaps
Oversley Lodge (Tomlinson 1935, pp. 435-5) and the lake clays of the Moreton area
(Tomlinson 1929, p. 184). Going northward, the evidence is much more extensively pre-
served, The laminated clays in Coventry have already been mentioned (p. 223). At Bed-
worth (Eastwood et al. 1923, p. 118) varved clays have been described and recognized as
lake deposits, though no inference was drawn from the fact that they lie exactly on the
present-day watershed between the Humber and Severn drainage. All over the eastern
half of Sheet 169, in the neighbourhood of Hinckley, Ullesthorpe, Monks Kirby and
Brinklow, there is a continuous cover of drift, known to extend very deep, and showing at
the surface a division into two clay series separated by a persistent sand and gravel horizon.
Though shown on the map under the general symbol of boulder clay, the descriptions in
the memoir and even more so the manuscript notes on the original ‘six-inch’ field maps
which I have examined in the offices of the Geological Survey, indicate that the lower clay
is consistently stoneless or nearly so and the upper clay sometimes similar—though it may
include also true till. Deeper evidence can only be provided by boreholes, but figure 5,
which shows some of the more important ones, indicates the dominance of lake deposits.

Still farther north, in Sheets 155 (Atherstone) and 156 (Leicester), not only are lake
