It has been supposed, in order
toremove this difficulty, that an under-current of water, salter
than the ocean, runs out of the Mediterranean at the Straits


176 Dr. Marcet on the specific gravity and temperature

of Gibraltar, and unloads its waters of their excess of alt. But however plausible this theory may be, it must be con-
fessed, that scarcely any other argument has hitherto been
alledged in support of the probability of this under-current,
than the easy explanation it would afford of the phenomena,
and analogies derived from the familiar fact of opposite atmo-
spheric currents formed in confined places, from the mere
admission of air of a different temperature.* The following
fact, however, for which I am indebted to Dr. Macmicnarr,
who had it from very respectable authority (the British Consul
at Valentia), seems to give considerable support to the above
theory. Some years ago a vessel was lost at Ceuta, on the
Coast of Africa, and its wreck afterwards thrown up at
Tarifta, on the European shore, full two miles west of Ceuta.
