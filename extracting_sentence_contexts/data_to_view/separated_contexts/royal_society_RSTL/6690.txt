by
applying the correction —6'5, and those on Plate XV. by applying —7'0.

Morcover, a small error in determining the centre in Plate XTV. also interferes with
the absolute correctness of the position-angles and of the heights of the prominences
above the moon's periphery. Subsequently to this being etched, I discovered the fact
that the centre should have been placed about 5” of linear space nearer 2709, in a direction
from 90® to that point, and 4” nearer 360%. The angular positions of some of the prin-
cipal prominences, determined by measurement of the original negatives, will be herein-
after given, 80 that no difficulty will be experienced in correcting the position of the
other prominences as read off from the Plates. The prominences in these Plates are
represented in their natural (erect) position, and this is also the case with the sun-spots
in Plate XV. ; the position-angles are laid down from North towards East.
