treatment of Egyptian cotton have given such contradictory results as were obtained
even by Mr. Hucues.*

Lastly, we should endeavour to distinguish between the effects of water and of
nutrient salts, as such. Here also we find the conception of pre-determination useful.
The differential watering was begun at Talbia on May 27-29. It is noted that
on July 4, some five weeks later, “the difference between the plots has become
noticeable . . . the heavily watered plots have large luxuriant plants with few
flowers, and the dry plots have thin small plants with an abundance of flowers.” (As
a matter of fact the actual difference in flowering on this date was merely as 0°67 : 0°46,
which illustrates the subjectivity of inspection methods with cotton.) Further, on
August 2, it is noted that the wet plots had “strong bushy plants, while the light
watering has given the reverse.”

This is merely a particular case of the paradox so familiar to gardeners as well as
to cotton growers, but it is one which gives rise to a great deal of mental confusion,
or else to the assumption of an inherent antagonism between growth and flowering,
forgetting that flowering is the result of growth. In the case of this Talbia experi-
ment its meaning seems clear: limitation of the accessible nitrates was checking
cell-differentiation in the terminal buds on the wet plots, while on the dry plots
such differentiation was proceeding normally. This pre-determined the frequency of
flowering subsequently, when the more abundant nodes of the dry plots were cramped
