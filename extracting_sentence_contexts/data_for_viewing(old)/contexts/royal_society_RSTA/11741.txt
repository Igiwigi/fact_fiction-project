its plates P,Q, and P,Q, normal to the incident and refracted lines. Each plate may
be protected from convective discharge into the fluid dielectric by a covering plate of
glass or mica, which will itself produce no refraction. In such a case, when both the
dielectric media are fluid, the total mechanical result of the electric excitation will be
the same as that of normal tractions on the interface between them, of intensity
— 2nn'® — 47’F towards each side, that is, in all (K,—K,) (27n'*/K,K, —T?/87) towards
the side 1. As the field of force in this condensing system is uniform except near its
edge, the interface will simply be lifted up between the plates by the amount which
corresponds to this traction, without ceasing to be horizontal. Thus the common
surface will be elevated when tan 4, is less than (K,/K,)!, while at greater incidences
it will be depressed.

This principle supplies in fact a method of obtaining the inductive capacities of
fluid media by angular measurement only, without the aid of an electrometer. When
the condenser P,Q,, P,Q, is charged, the interface between the fluids will usually

cease to be horizontal ; the upper plate P,Q, is then to be rotated until horizontality
is again obtained, as may be tested very exactly by reflexion of a beam of light ;
then the ratio of the tangents of the inclinations of the plates will be that of the
inductive capacities of the media. The method would also apply to solids, as we
might employ a prism of the material, over a horizontal face of which a sheet of a
fluid dielectric is spread, and observe the deviations from horizontality of the upper
