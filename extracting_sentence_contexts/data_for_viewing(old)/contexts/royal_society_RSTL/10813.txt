distance apart. Beyond this distance the sound rapidly degenerated into an un-
musical roar.

In order to sbudy this phenomenon more carefully, a small round hole was pierced
in the diaphragm of an ordinary hand telephone, and the chamber behind the
diaphragm placed in communication with a reservoir of air under gentle pressure,
which previous experiment had shown to give the best result. The telephone being
pub into circuit with a battery and rheotome in a distant room, each motion of the
diaphragm inwards naturally produced compression of the air in the chamber behind.

A 8mall flame being placed in front of the orifice, ib was found that nob only
musical vibrations, but alsv the more complex vibrations of speech, impressed upon
the diaphragm, could be quite loudly reproduced. In fact, when the telephone was
pub in eireuib with another telephone, or better with a battery and microphone in the

distant room, speech loud enough to be heard over a small apartment could be readily
produced. The words, however, were certainly lacking in distinctness.

A mos natural assumption was, that the sonnds heard regulted from the impact of
a series of pufls of air against the flame. Accordingly I attempted to produce a
greater yolume of sound by increasing the number of jets. Several small round holes
were pierced in the telephone diaphragm, and a separate flame placed in front of each
of them. The experiment did not justify my anticipations ; for it s00n appeared that
by far the most effective jets were those that issued near the centre of the diaphragm,
where the greatest motion existed ; an orifice near the circumference of the diaphragm
