which are marked © Purchased,” and appear not to have been accompanied by bones
of the endoskeleton. Nos. 551; 552, 554, 555, 596, 597 are fragments of carapace,
all presented by Sir Woopsixg PARi8H, and obtained from the locality mentioned aboye.
They are ascribed by Professor OweN to no less than three distinct species, however,


PROFESSOR HUXLEY ON THE OSTEOLOGY OF THE GENUS GLYPTODON. 39

viz. Glyptodon clavipes, G. reticulatus, and G. ornatus; a fourth species, G. tuberculatus,
is based upon purchased specimens, from the Pampas of Buenos Ayres, the precise
locality of which is not stated.

The fact that the dermal ossicles of three species of Glyptodon were found in the
same locality as the bones described, and the absence of any evidence demonstrating the
association of the ossicles ascribed to &. clavipes, rather than those attributed to the
other species, with the bones, throws, it will be observed, some doubt upon the certainty
of that ascription, and opens the question whether the bones really belonged to one form
of carapace or to another.

Of the Plates which illustrate the © Catalogue,” the first contains a side view, partly
restored, of the Glyptodon clavipes; the second, views of the carapace and tail; the
third, of the skull; the fourth and fifth, of parts of the carapace ; and the description of
the Plates comprises accounts of the structure of the skull and of the tail, parts which
had not been received until after the printing of the body of the catalogue.
