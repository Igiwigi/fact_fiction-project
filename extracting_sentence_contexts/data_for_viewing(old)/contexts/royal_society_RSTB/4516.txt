Dovetas, though the average CO, output for the whole period is approached in the
later stages of Experiment 6.

The extreme hyperpneea during the muscular work is obvious. Though the
metabolism, as judged by the oxygen consumption, is only about ten times the
average preliminary resting value, as opposed to the eight-fold increase shown in
Experiments 8 and 9, the volume of air breathed per minute is practically double
what it was in these experiments. What is more, this additional increase is brought ,
about entirely by increasing the rate of the respiration, for the depth of the breathing
is actually somewhat less than in Experiments 8 and 9. The excessive character of
the breathing is well brought out by the extremely low percentage of CO, in the
expired air (3 per cent., as opposed to 4} per cent. or more in the previous experi-
ments), as well as by the fact that the volume of expired air per 1 e.c. of CO, given
off is 39°8 c.c., instead of the 26°9 ¢.c. observed in the experiments with work of
1056 kg.m. per minute; had the latter ratio held good in Experiment 12, the
volume of air breathed per minute would have been only 77°5 litres instead of 114°8.
The volume of air breathed per minute remains about as great during the first
minute after the stop of the work as it was during the work. It then drops slowly,
and attains a fairly steady value 28} minutes after the cessation of the work. It
will be noticed that the rate of the breathing during the later stages of the after-
period remains much higher than in the other experiments on Doue.as, and that
there is a corresponding reduction in the depth; a rate of 18 breaths a minute
during rest has, however, often been observed in Douaias under other circumstances.
