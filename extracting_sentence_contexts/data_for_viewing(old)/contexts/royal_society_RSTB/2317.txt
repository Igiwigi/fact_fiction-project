sensory cortex would develop earlier than the corresponding region in the neigh-
bouring purely psychic portion of the brain. In the cases of chronic insanity, on the
other hand, the same relation should, and does, exist as regards the respective depth
of the conjoined first two layers in both regions of the cortex. From the measure-
ments of layers 4 and 5 in Table IV. (fig. 52), no conclusions can be drawn in spite of
the considerable difference in the depth of these layers in the first three and last
three cases respectively.

A more minute analysis of the measurements in Case 1 in Tables I. and IU. (figs.
49 and 50), brings forward certain considerations of importance as regards the
depth of the different layers of the cortex in the several regions of the convolutions.
The same facts may be seen on examination of the figures derived from the other
cases, but they are of less importance owing to the existence of important modifying
factors, e.g., in the infants, non-development of the adult structure; and in the
cases of chronic insanity, thickening of the membranes associated with wasting,
especially of the superficial portions of the convolutions and of the lips of the
fissures. The relative thicknesses of the different layers in the visuo-sensory and
visuo-psychie cortices respectively of Case 1 are seen in the following tables (figs.
47 and 48), in which the relative thicknesses of the layers in the several regions are
compared with the layers of the sides of the convolutions.
