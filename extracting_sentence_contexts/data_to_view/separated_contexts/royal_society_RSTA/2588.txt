Petrological
modelling (e.g. R-MELTS) can also provide some insights and constraints on intensive variables
(e.g. temperature, water content, oxidation state) that can be used to define appropriate conditions
for diffusion modelling (e.g. [29,30])

Finally, sectioning effects can lead to substantial inaccuracies in modelled diffusion durations. These arise from the fact that, in practice, compositional variations are typically measured as 1D
profiles across random 2D slices of 3D crystals, and profiles are modelled assuming diffusion
in one dimension. This can lead to significant inaccuracies compared to considering the full
complexity of 3D diffusion, even once the effects of non-isotropic diffusion are accounted for
[31,32]. Depending on the location and orientation of the measured profile, such effects can lead
to either overestimation or underestimation of the true diffusion time, for example by factors of
0.2-10 for olivine [32].
