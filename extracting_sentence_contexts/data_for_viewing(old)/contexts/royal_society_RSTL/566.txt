of his Imperial Majesty, obtained his enrollment among the
Fellows of the Royal Society. He connected the intrinsic
and extrinsic characters of minerals, in the Indez Fossilium,
which he published in 1772. In Sweden, BErRG@MaAN's treatise on
the forms: of crystals, published in the Upsal Transactions, in
1779, was a more authoritative recommendation to the inyes-
tigation of the principles of crystallization; and it can be of
little importance for me to add, that since I have possessed
the collection of Baron Born, in 1773, I have had every con-
firmation of the same opinion. The progress of chemistry and
of crystallography, applied to mineralogy, has rendered the exa-
mination of strata, and of mines, a source of amusement as
well as instruction ; and the arrangement of interesting facts,
in the chemistry and mechanism. of nature, suits my occasional
researches in geology, which, from variety of avocations and cir-
cumstances, have been very much interrupted. My acknowledg-
ment of obligation to the learned who have made this progress
in science, is the best recommendation I can give to others to
examine their works. Those whose talents and time are devoted
to the investigation of every mineral substance, can have no
respite to their labour ; minerals, in every state of their forma-
tion, perfection, and decomposition, as they occur in mines,
must have their qualities immediately ascertained, and be re-
served for profit, or thrown away on the heap. The practical
miner could not, without external characters, make any progress.
