The inference from these figures is that one
molecule of kojic acid absorbs 10 atoms of iodine (thus confirming the results previously
described) with the production of one molecule of iodoform (this would require a
theoretical value of 3-0 c.c. N/10 iodine in place of 2-44 ¢.c. actually obtained), and
7 molecules of iodide (requiring a theoretical value of 7-0 c.c. N/10 iodine in place of
7-61 c.c. actually obtained experimentally). It is also obvious that no substituted
iodine derivatives other than iodoform are produced. The divergence between
the experimental and theoretical figures is probably due to the fact that the iodoform
undergoes slight decomposition in the alkaline hypoiodite solution with the formation
of a corresponding amount of iodide. (3). Estimation of Formic Acid.—The method of estimation finally adopted was based
on that described by Fincxe (1913).
