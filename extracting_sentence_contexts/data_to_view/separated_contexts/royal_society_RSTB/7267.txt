The one is in the roof of
the nerve cord (n.c.), the other below the lateral motor complex (/at.mot.); in both places
the boundary is uncalcified and a mere | to 34 thick. In the former instance fibres have
been seen to penetrate the boundary and to run in conjunction with fibres on the farther
side (see below). An anatomical connexion of the two systems in the region of the
lateral motor complex is not so well established, but the responses of the tube feet and arm
under experimentally defined conditions of innervation (Smith 1945), show that excitation
can, in fact, be short-circuited through the lateral motor centres, and that in consequence
the motor arcs can be excited either centrally (through the radial cord) or peripherally. (6) The detailed anatomy of the motor supply to the arm musculature

The detailed constitution and fine anatomy of the motor tracts supplying the arm muscu-
lature may be exemplified by a description of the fibre systems which extend (figure 2) from
the radial nerve cord (n.c.) to the lateral transverse (a), longitudinal ambulacral (c), and
supra-ambulacral muscles (d). The cell bodies of the central distributory neurons (figures 2 and 3, c.dist.) lie in the floor
of the radial perihaemal canal.
