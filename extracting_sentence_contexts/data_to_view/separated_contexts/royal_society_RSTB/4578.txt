Again, tubercles with scrobicules transgressing the
sutures even more widely occur on the adapical surface, with no accompanying
disturbance of the plating. In this orad region of plate-grouping we have an almost
perfect repetition of the alternate dyads and simple plates found in Acrosalenia
(Plate 62, fig. 4), with the sole difference that no true combination occurs. in
P. ornatus. The fact, noted above, that demi-plates are most marked in this region
in areas I and V (where the actual number of plates in these shorter areas is the
same as that in the others) suggests that the plate-reduction (and grouping) is due
to “ growth-pressure” rather than to any direct influence of the tubercles. On the
other hand, the relatively great height of the plates seems inconsistent with
compression in the ordinary sense. The grouping extends into the peristomial
invagination, and usually only one pair (rarely two) of normally alternating primaries
occurs on the margin.
