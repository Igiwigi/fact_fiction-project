The MoS2/PANI composites with compositions of 1:1 and 1:6 showed capacitance values
of 417 and 567F g™!, respectively, with improved cyclic stability compared with PANI alone. Nanocomposites of MoS; and polypyrrole prepared by in situ oxidative polymerization show
a specific capacitance of about 700 F g~! at a scan rate of 10 mV s~! [159].

10. Valleytronics and trions

While electronic and spintronics devices generally exploit the charge and spin of electrons,
respectively, valleytronics relies on the fact that the conduction (valence) bands of some materials
have two or more degenerate minima (maxima), separated in the momentum space [163]. To
realize a valleytronic device, it is necessary to produce a valley-polarization by controlling the
number of carriers in these valleys. Monolayer MoS; is ideal for valleytronics with conduction
and valence band edges having two degenerate valleys at the corners (K and K’ points) of the 2D
hexagonal Brillouin zone (figure 14a).
