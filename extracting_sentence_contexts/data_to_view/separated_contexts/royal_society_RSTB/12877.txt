Thus, in vir-
tually all cases monkey experiments include a reinforcement
learning component, where actions are associated with past
outcomes. This is true even when the paradigm involves
establishing a symbolic system to communicate outcomes
and probabilities. In fact, in the absence of a shared language
or semantic system to communicate, monkeys are compel-
led to learn any representational system by trial-and-error
from feedback. In the present article, we argue that the above-mentioned
differences do not only present a technical issue, but also a
major epistemological challenge for the (strong) neuroeconomic
agenda. We detail why below.
