The only groups in which there is any substantial suspicion of a departure from a
3 to 1 ratio are those derived from Colne wild dextrals, in both of which there
is an excess of dextral broods—17 out of 18 on the dextral side and 17 out of
20 on the sinistral side, in all 34 compared with an expectation of 28-5. It is
true that these numbers do not differ from a 3 : 1 ratio by more than twice
the standard deviation and by the 7? test P is 0-04: they are also compatible
with the other groups, though if they are compared with the group showing the
largest defect in A broods the difference is 24 times its standard error and P is
only 0-01. But it may be remarkable that, of three groups showing a con-
siderable deficiency of sinistral broods, two should have come from Colne pairings,
though there is (below, p. 103) no similar deficiency in the F; groups derived
from pairing Colne wilds with E dextrals. The facts are suspicious, but it is
impossible to be sure that they indicate anything definite. The results described
below (p. 99) may also support the suggestion that Colne wilds are different
from the others.

Of the 340 F broods, 234 came from pigmented and 106 from albino parents. There
is no apparent association between shell twist and albinism (Table 4).
