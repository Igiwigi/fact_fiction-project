Summary of Conclusions.—lt appears that the chief cause of the anisotropic
character of the elasticity of wood is to be found in the fact that wood is built wp of cells, of
which the majority are long hollow cylinders, arranged parallel to the grain. The exis-
tence of the medullary rays is also an important factor in producing this anisotropic
elasticity. Mathematical analysis shows that these two features of the structure of wood
are sufficient to account for (i) the fact that wood has, at any point, three planes of elastic
symmetry, and (ii) the numerical relations that exist between the three Youne’s moduli
and the six Porsson’s ratios which are implied by this symmetry. It thus appears
unnecessary to make any assumption as to the character of the cell-wall substance
(e.g., Whether it is anisotropic or not) in order to explain the observed elastic properties
of wood. It is perhaps worth emphasising that a body can possess an anisotropic elasticity
due to the microscopic distribution of material in its structure, for this possibility must
have been overlooked by Satnt-VENANT when he proposed the “ rari-constant *’ stress-
strain relations for wood, which have since been found to be untrue (cf.
