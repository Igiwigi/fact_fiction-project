VERTEBRAL COLUMN OF AMPHIBIA AND AMNIOTA. 19

morphosis ; the reduction begins at the end of the tail and keeps step with the
disappearance of the whole organ.

For some unaccountable reason there seems to have been started the notion that
the Tadpole’s tail is not a phylogenetic, ancestral organ, but that it owes its existence
to adaptation to the aquatic life of the larva. Certainly the aquatic life keeps the
tail functional and preserves it for some time, but it is present, nevertheless, in the
embryo of Hylodes martinicensis, which undergoes its metamorphosis within the egg.
The presence of a chorda dorsalis and spinal cord in the tail of the anurous Amphibia,
and the fact that the tail is constructed exactly like the anterior portion of the axial
column, demonstrate the untenability of the notion mentioned above. The Tadpole’s
tail represents a typical vertebral column before the appearance of cartilage. Strictly
speaking, the tail begins with the first or second postsacral vertebra. That portion
of the whole tail shows the strongest development of cartilage, with subsequent loss
of metamerism, and becomes the coccygeum, which is required to form a “ backbone”
for the enormous belly of the Anura, perhaps because of the great shortening of the
trunk proper. The rest of the tail has during the phylogenetic development of these
Amphibia gradually lost its segmental nature and its cartilaginous elements ; it looks
now during its ephemeral existence like a pseudoprimitive organ.

An analogous case to the stowing awaly of a considerable portion of the alimentary
canal in, or rather below, the tail, is afforded by many Tortoises, in which a portion
