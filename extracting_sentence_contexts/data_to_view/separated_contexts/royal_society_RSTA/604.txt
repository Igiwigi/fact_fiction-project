There is some
latitude in the choice of field. We take a uniform field parallel to the axis and a central
dipole as representing two extremes in radial variation between which the truth must lie. In fact the results do not depend critically on the radial variation of the field so long as it
has its known value of about 4 gauss in the mantle near the core. The relative rotation of the two parts of the core produces currents (.S, currents in Elsasserâ€™s
notation) flowing in meridian planes downwards near the equatorial plane thence towards
the poles along paths near the axis and back towards the equator near the surface. These
currents produce a toroidal field (7) which encircles the axis from west to east in the northern
hemisphere and from east to west in the southern.
