liquid possess. This is also a measure of the mechanical stress which binds the
molecules of the gel or crystalline medium together and determines their rigidity.

In Part III. we have given reasons for locating the source of the local molecular
field within the molecule and we found that in the immediate neighbourhood of a

molecule the value of this field, as determined from the properties of crystalline media,
is of the order 10’ gauss. However the molecule is orientated, provided that
orientation is not variable with time, the local forcive will be of this order of intensity
and in some direction determined by the orientations of the two molecules between
which it acts. In a gel, as we pass from molecule to molecule, the direction of this
stress will be continually changing (fig. 1). Throughout a erystal, on the other hand,
its direction will be constant and will in fact be one of the determining factors of a
particular form of crystalline symmetry (fig. 14).

Tn a gel, the whole collection of molecules is bound together into one homogeneous
