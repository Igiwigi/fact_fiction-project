Due to
this final term, the shape of the NNM in the in-plane direction is dependent on the amplitudes of
the resonant responses in the first-in- and out-of-plane modes and varies over each oscillation. To examine these NNMs, first consider the S1 solution, in which U2 =0. Figure 4 shows the
trajectory of the mid-span deflections v(¢/2,t) and w(¢/2,t) for a range of values of U; up to
the bifurcation amplitude in the y versus —z (to account for the fact that z is defined positive
downwards) plane using (4.13) and (4.15). For each trajectory, the resonant frequency is different,
as shown in figure 3. The dashed line represents the maxima of the trajectories and corresponds
to the initial deflection points from which, provided the initial shape is imposed, the system can
be released into the pure S1 NNM.
