AND CHROMOSOME PAIRING IN OSMUNDA REGALIS 187

expanded its coils in a confined space. The coils themselves, however, though pushed
apart, are still present.* At least 10 are still intact, and complete straightening has
only been achieved near the ends of the chromosome. Since this stage, though early,
is not the beginning of prophase, it is highly probable that the untwisting, which
certainly occurs in prophase, is confined to this stage. The essential feature of telophase
cannot therefore be the “uncoiling and repacking of the chromosome thread”’ as has
sometimes been thought (Darlington 1937, p. 34), since in Osmunda very little, if any,
uncoiling occurs till after rest.

Another very important fact emerges from a measurement of the prophase chromo-
some figured (fig. 80, Plate 19). At this magnification ( x 2000) the length of the figured
specimen is 40 mm., as nearly as can be measured (see Appendix IV). Now if the
apparent diameter of a chromosome at metaphase or anaphase is measured, it is
possible to calculate the real length of the thread at these stages from the previous data
on the number of coils. The diameter at this magnification, in both a tapetal chromo-
some (fig. 46, Plate 17) and an archesporial chromosome (fig. 26, Plate 17), is of the
order of 1 mm. The length of the thread is then of the order of 1 x 14x 7=43 mm.
if a spiral is treated as a pile of circles. This value is only a rough estimate and a more
refined method is worked out in Appendix I. According to this the length of the
tapetal chromosome at metaphase (fig. 46) works out as 42-7 mm. and the archesporial
anaphase (fig. 26) as 41-1 mm. The tapetal anaphase of fig. 47 is under suspicion of
being swollen by the fixative, for its result is unexpectedly high (49-1 mm.). Every
