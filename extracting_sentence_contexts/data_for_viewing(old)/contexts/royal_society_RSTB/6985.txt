rows of plates as forming an exit from the sieve (figures 14, 17, sv.’) constituted by the
proventriculus. In a corresponding manner the gap between adjacent double rows of
plates (figure 17, sv.) may be spoken of as giving entrance to the sieve.

Apically the plates of the proventriculus bear setae (figures 14, 17) which are continued,
in diminishing order of size, down the margins of the plates facing the entrances to the
sieve. They disappear completely at the level of a slight irregularity in the margin of each
plate not far from the apex. This irregularity may be clearly seen in the foreshortened view
of the plates obtained in figure 14. A similar arrangement of setae is found on the plates
of C. oryzae, which have been compared with those of C. granaria, but in this species a stout
apically directed spine replaces the slight marginal irregularity of C. granaria.

Owing to the shape of the individual plates, and the fact that the lumen of the proven-
triculus narrows posteriorly, the entrance gaps to the sieve diminish posteriorly (figure
20, sv.). As a result of the divergence of the apices of the plates already mentioned, however,
the exit gaps expand posteriorly (figure 20, sv.’). The apical setae of the plates emphasize
this condition by being curved away from the exit gaps posteriorly and arching over the
rear of the entrance gaps, where they interlock with the setae of the adjacent double row
of plates (figure 14). Moreover, numerous setae arise from the wall of the proventriculus
at the extreme posterior ends of the entrance gaps, and interlock with the apical setae of
the plates (figure 14). These setae are mentioned by Miiller. The entrance gaps to the
sieve are therefore closed posteriorly by a dense felt-work of setae.

Anteriorly the exit gaps from the sieve apparatus are closed owing to the fact that each
double row of plates takes its origin anteriorly in a prominent cushion-like swelling at the
