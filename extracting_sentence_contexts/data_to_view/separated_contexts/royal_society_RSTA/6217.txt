In addition to the advantage of compact mathematical form, the use of principal stretches in
general and the Valanis—Landel hypothesis in particular allows an interpretation of the model
in terms of the molecular statistical theory of rubber elasticity, which was not in the scope of the
developments by Ogden [1]. To this end, the three eigenvectors of the right stretch tensor and their
corresponding eigenvalues can be understood as the referential direction and elongation of the
end-to-end vectors of three ideal representative chains, respectively. In fact, this link to the three-
chain model was already highlighted in [7] and later elaborated in [16,17]. Along these lines, it was
shown that Ogden’s phenomenological model can be reinterpreted in terms of a non-affine three-
chain model of non-Gaussian chains [16], based on a specific completion of four essential steps:
(i) postulation of a generally nonlinear relation between the deformation of the chain end-to-end
vector and the macroscopic deformation; (ii) a suitable representation of the free energy of a single
chain with fixed end-to-end length; (iii) complementation of the free energy through contributions
from topological constraints; and (iv) averaging of the chains’ free energy to obtain the energy
of the network. Adopting this idea, we show in the present work that, by accomplishing these
steps in a different way, one both recovers other well-known models of rubber elasticity and
easily discovers new forms that could turn out to be suitable for describing the behaviour of
hyperelastic rubber-like materials.
