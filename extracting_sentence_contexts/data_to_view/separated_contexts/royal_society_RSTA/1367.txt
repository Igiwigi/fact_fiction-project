In
[14], a different partial relaxation was introduced, relying on the so-called sequential laminates. In any case, a full relaxation is not available because the set of all composite materials obtained
by a general homogenization process is yet unknown in the elasticity setting. A crucial remark is to acknowledge the fact that, although periodic homogenization was
discussed here only for the case of a purely periodic characteristic function x (y), it is perfectly
legitimate to consider macroscopically modulated periodic functions, like (x, y). In other words,
the cell problems and the homogenized properties may vary from point to point in the working
domain D and thus depend on x (this is the strategy followed, for example, in [16]).

(d) Stress amplification tensor

The goal of this subsection is to compute the operator P, defined by (2.17). For simplicity, the
exponent p is assumed to be an even integer.
