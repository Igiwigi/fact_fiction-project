The constant a, tabulated in the third column of Table XIX., measures the rate of
decay of ionisation with rising temperature, and is greatest in the most concentrated
solutions,

Points of Inflexion.—The above expression for the influence of temperature on
conductivity enables us to calculate the positions of both the points of inflexion and
the maximum of conductivity of our general curve. ‘The results are given in
Table XIX., which shows under 6, and 6, the temperatures corresponding to the
lower and upper points of inflexion in the curve of molecular conductivity, whilst the
temperature of maximum conductivity is given by }(0,+6,). The values of 4,,
occurring as they do within or close to the experimental range of temperatures,
represent actual physical facts, but the values of 6, and $(0,+6,) can only be
regarded as an approximation to the probable behaviour of the solutions at higher
temperatures.

The values of @, and 6, are deduced as follows. By differentiating the logarithmic

equation we get
