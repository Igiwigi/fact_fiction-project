In the previous section, it was argued that the distribution of melt in the oceanic lower crust may
be dominated by the presence of liquid sills encased in hot cumulate rock. The next question to


address is that of the characteristic thickness of such sills. The fact that individual melt bodies
are difficult to image with geophysical approaches places an upper bound on their size on the
scale of 100s of metres. Petrological and geological observations from ophiolites indicate that
the melt layer thickness may be substantially smaller, perhaps as little as a metre. The vertical
evolution of mineral compositions on the sub-metre scale in near-Moho cumulate gabbros from
both Troodos [60] and Oman [26] have been used to support this finding.
