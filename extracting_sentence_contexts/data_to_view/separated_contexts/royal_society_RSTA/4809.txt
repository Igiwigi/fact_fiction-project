gamma-ray tomography [2] and X-ray tomography [3]. The advantage of non-invasive methods
is—beside the fact that the flow is not influenced—the applicability at high temperatures and high
pressures as well as for chemically aggressive substances. Further, a high spatial resolution and a
good material penetration capability are provided in general. X-ray tomography is based on measuring the attenuation of X-rays with initial intensity No
