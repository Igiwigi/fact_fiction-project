viscous heavy fluid. The blast which swept down into the valleys at the south side
of the Soufri√©re was too heavy to climb vertically the steep face of the Morne Garu.
It split into two parts, one of which ascended obliquely over each shoulder of the
mountain, mowing down the forest and strewing the trunks of the trees before it in
such a way as to mark the direction of its path, The avalanche, on the other hand,
when it reached these valleys turned almost at a right angle to its previous course and

flowed along them, clinging to the ravines, but did not ascend the opposing slopes.
Except in this case there is little evidence that the blast had any power of climbing ;
it seems, in fact, to have been so heavy, so weighted down with dust that it flowed
along the depressions of the hill sides almost like a torrent of water. This is shown
by the evidence of those who saw the black cloud pouring in an inky mass down
the gorges on the leeward side of the hill. The Carib Country is too level and open
to modify in any way the course of this current, but at Chateaubelair there are several
well-marked ridges between the village and Wallibu, and these certainly directed and
deflected the path of the blast. At the north side of Richmond Vale Estate there is a
spur, some 500 or 600 feet high, running down to the sea, and on the side of this ridge
next the crater the destruction of vegetation has been very great; on the south side,
a week or two after the eruption, everything was as green as before. It is in every
way probable that these ridges saved the village, and a careful examination of the
difference in the appearances presented by the country to the north and to the south
side of each of them convinced us that they had intercepted the violence of the blast,
