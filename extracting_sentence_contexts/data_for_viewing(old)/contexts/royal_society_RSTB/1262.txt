ordinary cells, not developed as elaters, depending from the apex, appear to
illustrate a matter of some importance. I think we may recognize in them im

mode of advance in sterilization, and it will be seen that this idea had note
the mind of Lerrezs.
In the Anthocerotes the sporogonium attains a greater complexity than in
Hepatic, but it is not uniform in the different genera, and the variations in
ture have made them the subject ofa careful discussion by Lerrers (‘ Lebers
Heft 5), from which the following facts and quotations are extracted.
In the more complex genera, Anthoceros and Dendroceros, the lower part ¢
sporogonium is developed as a foot, which keeps up physiological connection y¥
gametophyte ; there is no seta, but the whole of the upper part of the sporoge
is composed of a columella, round which, and arched like a dome over its e
apex, is the sporogenous layer, while the sporogonial wall, of several layers,
this externally. The central cells, formed by periclinal division from each
verse tier of four in the young embryo, are entirely converted into the colw
the sporogenous layer being cut off from the outer cells by their first per
division. But of the sporogenous layer itself the majority of cells are sterile,
only the minovity produce spores ; the sterile cells in many species form a cont
network, in the meshes of which the spore-mother-cells lie (Joc. cit., p. 6). The
calary growth at the base of the sporogoniim is apparently unlimited.
