The
process of intravitelline separation of yolk cells, on the other hand, is primary. Its
absence is secondary, so that the non-existence of the first gastrulation phase in a few
insects should be regarded as a secondary modification.

b. A New Theory of Multi-phased Gastrulation Among Insectsâ€”The theory to be discussed
is essentially a development of the newer biphased gastrulation theory and has been
necessitated by certain facts recently discovered by myself and other authors. It
also attempts, in part, to combine the already described older and newer biphased
gastrulation theories. From both of these, however, it differs in the fact that insect
gastrulation is no longer to be regarded as a process occurring in only two main
periods of activity but in several.
