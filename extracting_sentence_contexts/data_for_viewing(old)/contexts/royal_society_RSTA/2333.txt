as well as the (unchanged) homogeneous Neumann condition on the C-shaped surface.

As we are interested in propagating waves, only real-valued entries of q are considered.
Moreover, by periodicity, it suffices to consider values of q in the so-called first Brillouin zone
{qW|qWe [-7,7)*}. In fact, owing to the symmetry of the C-shapes about the x-axis, q2 is
symmetric about the q1-axis and, by a time-reversal argument, the eigenvalue also does not
change if q is swapped for —q. The full picture is thus given by {q W | q W € [0,)?}, which makes
up the so-called irreducible Brillouin zone in this case.

We solve the Bloch problem using the finite-element method. In order to simplify the numerical
computation, we add a small thickness to the C-shaped walls. Thus, the radius in the following
results refers to the inner radius (decisive for the internal resonance). Results for the fifth C-shape
(radius = as) are displayed in figure 2. Figure 2a shows the first and the second band (solid blue
lines) for qz = 0. In solid-state physics, the left-hand end, q; W =0, is called the '-point, while
the right-hand end, q; W=17, is referred to as the X-point. For comparison, the first band of
the equivalent closed circle (g =0, same outer radius) is also shown (solid grey curve) as well
as the so-called light line (dashed black line), which is the band of free space. As can be seen,
