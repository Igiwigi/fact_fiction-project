Hence the thin laminar
extension of the perianth, which soon finds a new use from the standpoint of wind
dispersal ; and this, with consequent precocity of formation, usurps the place of all
other useless parts. There is no reason why these may not have once included
functionless stamens derived from a once hermaphrodite flower, although there is
no direct proof available at the present time. These correlations are not merely
fanciful: they afford a logical sequence for the deduction of the fact, sufficiently
obvious, though requiring to be â€˜established, that the ancestral cone was a more
elongated strobilus, in the axils of whose scales arose centric flowers and a centric
nucellus invested by centric envelopes, without lateral extensions. Furthermore, in
such a cone, the scales would at some time have been separated by internodal
