Like the stem, then, the root shows a progressive response to wounding from the
seedling to the adult condition, and an accumulation of resin canals in the more distal
parts. The false annual ring is often less distinct here than in the stem, the reason
for which seems to be connected with the more open character of the wood in distal
roots—perhaps also with the more diffuse arrangement of the canals.

A further feature in connection with the loss of the lateral roots might be mentioned
here. There are horizontal canals in the secondary wood of the root that originate
at the canals in the primary wood and are associated with the vestiges of lateral roots.
These continue beyond the buried remains of the laterals into the later formed secondary
wood and bast of the main root, and are so similar to the ordinary horizontal ones of
the medullary rays as to be readily mistaken for them. The fact that they occur often
in pairs, and at a very slight tangential distance apart, is helpful in establishing their
identity. On being traced inwards the pairs are often found to join just before the
primary canal of the main root is reached.

8. ConcLUsIONS.
1. Anastomosis of the different systems of resin canals is far from the rule in Picea :—
(a) No single instance of anastomosis of the primary cortical resin canals with those
of the adjacent bast in the stem has been found, even where wounding has produced

an excessive number of resin canals. In the root, primary cortical resin canals
are wanting.
