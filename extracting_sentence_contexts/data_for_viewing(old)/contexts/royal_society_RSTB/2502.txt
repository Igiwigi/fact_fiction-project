Rodents show no sign of a Tapetum lucidum. They all have fundi which are uniform
in colour, showing various degrees of transparency. The vascularisation differs

enormously in the various sub-orders, ranging from complete absence to the most
prolific distribution of vessels, The disc likewise shows a wide range of differentiation,
comprising both the largest as well as the smallest dise found in any class of
Mammals. In fact, there is a greater variety of type in this order than in any other.

Throughout the Rodents the pupil is circular both when dilated and contracted,
the only exceptions being the Marmots, the Ground Squirrel, the Coipu and
Capybara, which have a slightly oval pupil. All the wild Rodents show a marked
degree of hypermetropia, which, however, tends to disappear in captivity. This
explains why those who have examined domestic Rabbits and Guinea-pigs have
recorded such varied results. The domestic Rabbits exhibit all degrees of refraction
and astigmatism, whereas the common wild Hare (Lepus ewropaus) has a considerable
degree of hypermetropia. All Rodents have the power of retracting the eye into the
orbit, the lids closing as the eye is withdrawn into the socket. The nictitating
membrane is in all rudimentary, as in Man. â€˜The cornea is a perfect hemisphere, and
extends in most cases to the equator of the globe.
