We obtained between 2 and 2204 reads (mean = 427) per
ospC amplicon and between 2 and 210 reads (mean = 60.3)
per rrs-rrlA IGS amplicon that fulfilled the annotation criteria
specified in §2d. The difference in coverage between loci can
be attributed to the sequencing design (two sequencing
regions for ospC versus one region for rrs-rrlA IGS), but
also to the stricter BLAST criteria needed for annotating/
keeping the rrs-rrlA IGS strains (see §2d).

The accuracy of quantification by amplicon sequencing
was evaluated. The results from the two loci—ospC and rrs-
rrlA _IGS—were compared and found to be very similar. In
this analysis, we took advantage of the fact that B. afzelii
(like B. burgdorferi; [23,24]) has a highly clonal genetic struc-
ture so that ospC and rrs-rrlA IGS are in strong LD,
especially within populations [13,19]. A previous study
showed that among the ospC and rrs-rrlA IGS alleles detected
in this study, there are five ospC alleles that can be expected
to be in perfect LD (LD = 1) with a single rrs-rrlA IGS allele
at our main study site at Kalvs mosse, Revingehed (ospC
1-rrs-rrlA IGS 1, 2-2, 4-4, 7-11 and 9-9; cf. fig. 1d,e in

of that ospC allele times the overall B. afzelii infection intensity
as measured by qPCR), infection intensity of the correspond-
