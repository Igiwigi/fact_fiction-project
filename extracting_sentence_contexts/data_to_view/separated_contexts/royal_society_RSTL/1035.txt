Metals, it is well known, readily transmit large quanti-
ties of electricity ; and the obvious limit to the quantity which
they are capable of transmitting seems to be their fusibility,
or volatilization by the heat which electricity produces in its
passage through bodies. Now I had found in several experiments, that the intensity
of this heat was "connected with the nature of the medium by
which the body was surrounded ; thus a wire of platinum
which was readily fused by transmitting the charge from a vol-
taic battery in the exhausted receiver of an air pump, acquired
in air a much lower degree of temperature. Reasoning on

* I made geveral experiments on the effects of currents of electricity simultaneously
passing through air in different states of rarefaction in the same and different direc-
tions, both from the yoltaic and common electrical batteries ; but I could not es-
tablish the fact of their magnetic attractions or repulsions with regard to each other,
which probably was owing to the impossibility of bringing them sufficiently near.

this circumstance, it occurred to me, that by placing wires in
a medium much denser than air, such as ether, alcohol, oils,
or water, I might enable them to transmit a much higher
charge of electricity than they could convey without. being
destroyed in air; and thus not only gain some new results as
to the magnetic states of such wires, but likewise, perhaps,
determine the actual limits to the powers of different bodies
to conduct electricity, and the relations of these powers. A wire of platinum of +3, of three inches in length, was
fused in air, by being made to transmit the electricity of two
batteries of ten zinc plates of four inches with double copper,
strongly charged: a similar wire was placed in sulphuric
ether, and the charge transmitted through it. It became sur-
rounded by globules of gas; but no other change took place ;
and in this situation it bore the discharge from twelve batteries
of the same kind, exhibiting the same phenomena.
