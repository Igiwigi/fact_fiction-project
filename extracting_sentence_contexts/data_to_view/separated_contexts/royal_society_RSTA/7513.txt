For air in the visible spectrum, this
equation can be reduced to the form

(n?—1)/(n2+2) = a,+b,d-2+c,a-4. As the present investigation was concerned only with the limited range of visible
wave-lengths 0-44—0-64, which is well removed from the position of the absorption
bands of air in the extreme ultra-violet region, interpolation equations expanded in the
Cauchy form with three terms were found to give a completely satisfactory expression
for the dispersion of air.

(f) Effects of composition of the air upon refraction measurements. The question of the
relation between refractive index and density of air is rendered additionally difficult
owing to the fact that air is a mixture of many gases. Certain chemical data relating to
the constancy of composition of the atmosphere at the earth’s surface, apart from the
proportions of water vapour and carbon dioxide present, appear to indicate that
appreciable variations of density may be found in different samples, and this might be
expected to lead to similar variations in refractive index, but it is shown later in this
paper that the refractivity of different samples of air is remarkably constant. It is usually assumed that a normal amount of 0-03 % by volume of CO, is present
in the open air and also in well-ventilated rooms, but in badly ventilated rooms this
proportion may be considerably exceeded.
