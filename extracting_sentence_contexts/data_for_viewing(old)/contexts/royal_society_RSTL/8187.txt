222 PROFESSOR W. C. WILLIAMSON ON THE ORGANIZATION

the most common of the Lepidodendroid strobili in the Lower Coal-measures of Oldham
is a mall one, of the central axis of which I have given a representation in fig. 59, enlarged
two diameters, or in the same proportion as fig. 58. Of course I cannot affirm that the
two are actually portions of the same plant; but it is enough for my present, purpose to
indicate the possibility of such a relation. The correspondences of size, the similar
central area in each, and the vascular ring surrounding that area present coincidences
too striking to be overlooked.

It will have been observed that IT have said nothing about that remarkable form of
Lepidodendroid plant, the Halonia. The fact is, T have not been able to obtain speci-
mens throwing any light upon this subject beyond what has already been done by
Mr. Dawes. His figure and description, given in the Proceedings of the Geological
Society of London for March 22, 1848, are 80 clear that there can be no difficulty in
locating the plant in its proper place. The central axis consists of cells arranged as in
my Plate XXVI. fig. 13, Plate XXV. fig. 14, & Plate XXVII. fig. 25, this is gurrounded
by a cylinder of barred vessels, as in fig. 13, from the outer surface of which the vascular
bundles going to the bark are given off,

The late Mr. Jaxes Wire, of Oldham, published a notice in the Â© Geologist * for 1863,
Pp. 266, in which he states that a specimen of Lepidodendron with an alonis attached
settles in the affirmative the question whether or not the latter is the root of the former.
Through the kindness of Mr. NizLD, in whose cabinet the specimen now is, I haye had
