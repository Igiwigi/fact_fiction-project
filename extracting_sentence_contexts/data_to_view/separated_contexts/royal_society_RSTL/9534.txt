N This is opposed to the observations of NussBAUM, but NUs8BAUM, T think, directed
E his attention 80 much to the granules contained by the cells that he overlooked the
= cell-protoplasm.

= T have nob been able to satisfy myself of the meaning of this increase in 8taining-
E) power of the protoplasm. Since the granules split up during activity, we might
Ã¾& imagine that the cells do not at once cast out the whole of the substances formed, but
= retain a certain proportion, and that this diffused throughout the cell causes it to stain
b= more than normally with osmic acid. Z There is, however, another way of looking at the fact. Generally speaking, the
Z formation of granules goes hand-in-hand with a diminution in the power of staining of

the cell-substance. In the latter period of digestion, when the granules are increasing
the cell-snbstance stains less and less with osmic acid.
