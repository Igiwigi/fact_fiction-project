The consequence of this is a difference of pressnres, which urges the
ring in the direction of the cyclic motion through the ring, and it begins to move
forward with increasing velocity. After a time this translatory motion would increase
80 much as to make the velocity within the aperture approach to that without ; the
state of motion will therefore be one in which the translatory velocity tends continually
to a limit,

The present communication is divided into three sections, In the first, new
functions are introduced to give the stream lines. These functions are connected
with, and have analogous properties to, the Toroidal Functions ; are, in fact, given by
R=SdP/du and T= —SdQ/du. They have the property of being single-valued, even
when they represent cyclic motion—a motion which the single-valued Toroidal
Functions cannot by themselves represent. At the end of the section the values of
