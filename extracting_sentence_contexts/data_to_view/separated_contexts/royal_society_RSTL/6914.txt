It is also confined to the negative side of the axis of p. For between the limits p=0, p=—1%,

648p*+672p7, i. e. 24(27p*+28p?) is obviously poxitive,

and

4
96p*+176p*+81p'= F{(24p+22)*+2} is always poxitive. Hence the two values of s are both negative throughout the extent of the curve A,
Thus &+#—##*—#%; being negative, &—z* and 5 —#* have the same 8igns when 8, 7

are real, as should be the case; for in order that A may be capable of yanishing, (f®—#)
and 1(4'—e*) must, by Nzwrox's rule, be both negative, which could not be the cage if
either « or 1 were negative; 80 that &—1* and 7'—# must have the same signs, in fact
each must be negative. The curve A under consideration has a multiple point of the 4th order of multiplicity
at the origin, where it is touched by the axis of p. Its distance from the axis for the
extreme yalue of p, viz.
