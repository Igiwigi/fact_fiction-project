Proof. This assertion is merely a combination of the results of previous theorems. The
given integrals must first be expressed as products of an LZ integral and an S integral, the
values of the latter being —2 and —1 respectively by theorem 13. The expression for the
first Z integral is given directly by theorem 15. The second is obtained by putting —P,,/r,.
for Gj. in theorem 16, which gives a linear combination of integrals of the first type as
a result. (L,+L,—L) can be taken as even, since the resulting terms vanish if this is not so.

Comment. The above analysis expresses all the two-electron integrals required for atoms
in terms of integrals of the radial factors of the single-electron functions and in terms of the
Q coefficients. The Q coefficients are defined in terms of other quantities, but since only
comparatively few are required, these will be tabulated and used as numerical data. The
wisdom of this is illustrated by the fact that for extensive calculations on atomic states, up
to those of 3p shell, only fifty such coefficients have been used. No general formula for the
radial integrals can be given, since these might involve very different types of functions in
different applications. However, for the case of the polynomial exponential functions
which are used in the accompanying numerical investigations general formulas can be
obtained and have been given in part II. Formulas for the corresponding single-electron
functions are also given there, so that the analysis of this section has reduced the evaluation
of all the fundamental integrals required for converging calculations of atomic wave
functions to comparatively simple and stereotyped procedures.
