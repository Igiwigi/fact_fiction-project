The cyclic ethereal flow in
magnetic field must therefore be very slow; but the radiation traversing it is”
course very fast. To bring this result into line with the present theory we are compelled to assum
that the density of the «ther is at least of the same order of magnitude as tl
densities of solid and liquid matter, at any rate if we must adhere to the view tha
the motion of the ether carries the light with it. This hypothesis is of a somewhe
startling character ; the density under consideration belongs however to an intangib!
medium and is not apparently amenable in any way to direct perception ; it is on
different plane altogether from the density of ordinary matter, and is in fact m
properly considered simply as a coefficient of inertia in the analytical expression
the energy. * 0. J. Lonar, “ Aberration Problems,” ‘ Phil.
