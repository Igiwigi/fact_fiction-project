In passing to the next group of movements a prefatory explanation is needed of
our use of the term, movements of the mouth. By such term we wish to imply the
opening and closure of the oral cavity, i.e., lowering and raising of the lower jaw.
Although we shall show that the lower jaw may be occasionally depressed within the
closed lips, but that, if combined with compression of the lips, the mouth may remain
shut, it is nevertheless more convenient and in accordance with general usage that
the mandibular movements and the opening or closing of the labial fissure should be
considered together.

Contrary to that which we had observed in the Bonnet (Macacus sinicus), in the
Orang we never obtained evidence that the movement of mastication was represented
in the cortex. We, of course, only credit this fact with the value generally attached
to negative evidence. The various combinations of movements associated with the
opening of the mouth we will consider in the chapter on the “ Marches” observed,
see p. 146.

(11) Opening of the Mouth—This fundamentally important movement we found
to be represented, exactly as in the Bonnet Monkey, at the foot of the ascending
frontal and parietal gyri, around the lower end of the Fissure of RoLAnpo, viz., at
squares («) in front of Fissure of RoLanpo, 20, 21, 22, 84, (b) behind the Fissure of
RoLanpo, 91, 92.

It is universally well marked in the squares in front of the Fissure of RoLanpo,
but only moderately in those which lie behind it (at 91, 92). See Plate 19, fig. 11.
