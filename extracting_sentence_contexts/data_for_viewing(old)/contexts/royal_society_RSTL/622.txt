time, or frequency of those pulsations, determines the note ; but
it is the velocity of the particles of the air, or the breadth of the
wave, on which the force or strength of the sound depends ;' and
this velocity becoming less, as the distance from the sonorous
body increases, the sound is weakened in the same proportion.

There are several circumstances which might lead us to
suspect, that colour depends on the frequency of those pulsations
which have been supposed to constitute light ; and that the beat
produced by them is in proportion to their force.

If this supposition should be well founded, a knowledge of
that important fact might perhaps enable us to explain several
very interesting phenomena ;â€”the combustion of inflammable
bodies, for instance ; and the great intensity of the heat which
is produced by the concentration of calorific rays.

There are several well known experiments with burning
glasses, which show that the intensity of the heat generated by

the concentration of the solar rays, is not simply as the conden-
sation of those rays, but in a higher proportion ; and, that it -
