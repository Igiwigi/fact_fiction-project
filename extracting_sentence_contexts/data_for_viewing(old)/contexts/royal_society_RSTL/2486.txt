its favour is almost entirely hypothetical ; for hitherto there has not been even one
well-conducted experiment which proves the existence of any form of free carbon in
the venous blood.

Another class of physiologists maintain that the carbonic acid is formed, not in
the lungs, but in the general round of the great circulation ; in proof of which
some experimentalists have asserted that they had obtained carbonic acid from
venous blood ; but others, of equal respectability, who have repeated the same expe-
riments, deny the existence of this acid in the venous current. The air-pump has
hitherto been almost exclusively used for the purpose of deciding this question ; but
the positive proofs which have been brought forward by the one class of physiolo-
gists have been 80 completely contradicted by the negative proofs of the other, that
a great majority remains till in fayour of the old theory. In fact, TrigpeManN and
Gwe1an, the latest writers on this subject, are decidedly of opinion that venous
blood does not contain carbonic acid. As this is a very important question, the fol-
lowing experiments were made in reference to it.

1. A glass vessel containing a 8mall quantity of warm and fluid venous blood was
put under the receiver of an air-pump. In proportion as the air was exhausted, a
number of globules appeared to escape from the blood, which were at first small, but
in proportion as the air was removed they became larger in size.

2. A small quantity of venous blood, contained in a glass vessel, was covered with
a layer of barytic water. This was put under the receiver of an air-pump. When the
