Those of the inner layer belong to the sense-cells,
and doubtless also to the ganglion-cells, from which we must suppose the nerve-fibres
to have grown out. Pigment first appears at Stage R, in the inner layer of the
retina, in the form of very small granules arranged in radiating lines (fig. 26). In the adult retina we find the nuclei of the ganglion-cells lying in the nerve-fibre
zone and nearer to the nuclei of the radial fibres than to those of the sense-cells, in
fact they have begun to assume this position already at Stage R (fig. 26, . g. ec). We can now, therefore, distinguish three layers of nuclei: an outer layer belonging
to the radial fibres, an inner layer belonging to the sense-cells, and a middle layer

belonging to the ganglion-cells. These are the only three kinds of cells which occur
in the retina of the pineal eye, if we except the wandering pigment-cells which seem
to have the power of passing into the retina from the surrounding connective tissue.
