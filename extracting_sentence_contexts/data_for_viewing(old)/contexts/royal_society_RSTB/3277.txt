and functioning, and they usually contained less at the close of the experiment.

Professor Dixon has measured the minimal value for the resistance in a particular ’
case ; my own results give for the most part maximal values, such as occur only
when transpiration is very active. If the cohesion theory is unable to explain how

these maximal resistances are overcome, it becomes of very subordinate value. .
No mechanism can work permanently under a strain which tests every part nearly

to breaking point, and the cohesion theory, to be accepted as a full explanation, must
give a considerable margin to overcome resistances beyond the minimum. At

present the cohesion theory does not do this, nor does it explain all the facts.

No one will deny that cohesion may aid in the ascent of sap, but it appears to be

of subordinate and mainly temporary value, the columns in the vessels breaking

under moderate strain, and only being restored again when living cells are present

in the wood.
