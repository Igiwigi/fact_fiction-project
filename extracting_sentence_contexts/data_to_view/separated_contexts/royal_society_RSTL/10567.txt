that he was evidently aware that other causes might affect the result, and that the
differences of surface tension given by different experiments varied considerably. Thus, if we attempt to compare the snrface tensions of two spherical films by
measuring their sagitte, the question of the real magnitude of their circular bases
becomes important. The fact that a film adheres to its solid support by means of a
ring of comparatively thick liquid makes it uncertain whether the dimensions of the |
film can be directly inferred from those of the solid, In one of Vay per MENSBRUGGHE'S experiments the films were formed on a ring
4 cry, in diameter, and their sagittz were 1655 and 1770 mm. respectively. If,
therefore, the bases of both segments had the same diameter as the ring, the radii of
the spheres, of which they were parts, were 2036 and 2:015 em.
