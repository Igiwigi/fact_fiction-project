The maxilla, when present, is throughout the whole of the Branchiopoda, relatively
of small size, and in consequence easily overlooked. It exhibits two well-defined
types—on the one hand that found in the Notostraca and Conchostraca, and on the
other, that exhibited by the Anostraca, Cladocera and Lipostraca.

The maxilla of the Notostraca is too well known from Cuavs’s description to need a
fuller detailed account. It consists of two distinct parts—an inner setose lobe or endite,
and an outer tubercle on which opens the duct of the maxillary gland. Wacumr (1927,
p. 316) states that the moving up of this tubercle towards the endite portion of the
limb gives a false impression of a biramous constitution. There is no evidence, however,
that the duct is moving towards the middle line, but rather the reverse, as in the
Anostraca it opens on the limb itself. Its position so far removed from the middle line
and ‘pointing outwards is probably correlated with the fact that in the Notostraca
there is little, if any, forward current along the mid-ventral line, certainly in the region
behind the mouth. Hence there will be no continuous stream of water to sweep away
the excretion as it leaves the duct, and so the opening of the duct is placed at a distance
from the mouth. Similarly, in Limnetis which, like the Notostraca, is a mud-eater,
the opening of the maxillary duct is on a tubercle situated immediately outside the
maxillules, the remainder of the maxilla having disappeared. This agrees with Sars’s
description (1896, p. 123).

Thus, neglecting the excretory tubercle, the maxilla of these two orders may be said
to consist of a single small setose endite. In the Notostraca this curves round the median
face of the basal part of the maxillule, that is, the part on which the sete point forward.
In the typical Conchostracan, Estheria, it occupies a similar position, so that its sete
