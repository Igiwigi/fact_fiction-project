to produce any inhibition. If the vagus had proved active, aconine in doses sufficient
to put motor nerve terminations out of play did not affect it ; only large sub-lethal
and lethal doses were found capable of reducing or altogether suspending vagus
action. No acceleration of the heart followed this action. Sinus stimulation has
been seen in the large majority of cases to retain its controlling effect until the heart
stopped beating spontaneously ; after this occurrence its stimulation, or frequently
Ghat of the vagus, provoked sequential contraction, lasting for a longer or shorter
Pme.

g It appears, then, that the slowing of aconine is not referable to a stimulation of
fihibitory apparatus within the heart, which is controlled by the vagus, but that it
gather limits the origination of motor impulses by acting upon some mechanism non-
Blentical with the vagal. The fact that atropine does not accelerate the heart slowed
by aconine makes it improbable that this mechanisin is that rendered active by

Stimulation of the sinus venosus.
