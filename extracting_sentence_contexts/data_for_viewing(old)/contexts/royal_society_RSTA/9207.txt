28, 16, where 48 on p(—A) is 52°16, 3d on p(—A) is 42°78, 6 on S(A) is 36°15, 2d on
p(—A) is 28°52, 8 on p(—3A) is 16. But also 42 is the double link, e—b, and may
indicate an unobserved line. As corresponding examples from Au may be taken the
chain from 18449(AuS(3).e.12). A very exact example of lines at equal distances
on either side is given by 26842 (AuX iii, d 14). The adjacent lines differ from it
by—46'49, and 46°49 on either side. Nowa displacement of 23, on VX,, produces
46°44. They are therefore ordinary displacements +2é, on either side of 26842. A
complete discussion of the whole spectrum must take account of these possibilities.
The present paper only deals with the establishment of the truth of the linkages
effect.

The majority of the linkages observed are represented in sixteen maps. This
method is in fact the only way in which the general connection can be visualised and
realised. They are based on the differences as found and consequently must contain
a considerable number of chance coincidences, although for the reason given above
(p. 863) the number will be less than that given by the probability formula. In the
present state of our knowledge there is little to decide where they occur. Ina few
cases the existence of a coincidence may be evident and be traced. For example, the
lines 15923, 19113, in the AuX linkage which differ by 3190°13, or apparently by a
modified a link, really belong to a doublet of the D type, referred to in more detail
later. They are respectively the D,, and D,, terms. The satellite D,, is 19738,
which gives the normal separation 3815°54 with 15923. They are in inverse order—or
their formula gives negative values. The satellite separation D,,—D,, = 625°41 and
as it chances 3815°54—625'41 = 3190°13. Thus the apparent a link is not really so,
it is a pure coincidence. It is further possible that links attached to these lines may
