If the
limit were known to be a single number there could be no doubt as to its belonging to
the d sequences, or as to the series being of the F type. But there is just the
possibility that it may be a composite number, comprising one or more links—say, p or s
terms—and that the separations may be due to oun displacements in one of them. The suspicion that this may be the case is aroused by the fact that the triplet 17615,
18447, 20312, which would be the origin of the d or F() term, and in which
therefore the first two lines should behave as satellites do not show complete sets with
the separation 1778, 815, as they should do if normal satellites. Moreover, the
intensity order with the middle line much more intense than the other is not normal. There is no test for the composite nature of 30725, but if it be really so, the most
probable source would be p=S(), or some near collateral of this.
