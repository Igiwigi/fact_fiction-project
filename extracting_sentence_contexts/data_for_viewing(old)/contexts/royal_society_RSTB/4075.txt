The earliest sign of activity in the ventricle as a whole, as estimated from the values
of extrinsic deflections, comes between 0°0070 and 0:0192 second before the upstroke
of 2. When we were studying the auricle we found that the value of the earliest
extrinsic deflection practically coincided with the value of the earliest intrinsic deflec-
tion in this chamber as a whole. In the auricle this fact can be easily established
because the excitation wave spreads from a single centre, whose position is favourable
to observation.

In the ventricle our earliest extrinsic deflections clearly indicate that some region
is activated as a rule 0°0100 or 0°0150 second before R appears (and 0°0050 second
or more before @ is written). We had hoped to find intrinsic deflections of like value,
but in this we have been disappointed. Sometimes our earliest intrinsic would
approach to within 3, 4 or 6 thousandths of a second of the earliest extrinsic
deflection ; in other instances a hiatus of a hundredth of a second or a little more would
be left (see Table XIV). That there is generally a hiatus is perhaps not surprising,
seeing that many readings cannot be secured from the lining of the heart; our view
