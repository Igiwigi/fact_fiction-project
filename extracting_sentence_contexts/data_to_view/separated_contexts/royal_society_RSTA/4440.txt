From these series we find for the ratio of the tide-heights to the equilibrium tide-
heights at the equator the four values

— 2°4187, —1°8000, + 11°0725, + 1°9225,

On comparison of these numbers with those obtained for the solar tides in the
preceding section, we see that for a depth of 7260 feet the solar tides will be direct
while the lunar tides will be inverted, the opposite being the case when the depth is
29,040 feet. This is, of course, due to the fact that in each of these cases there is a
period of free oscillation intermediate between twelve solar (or, more strictly, sidereal)
hours and twelve lunar hours. The critical depths for which the lunar tides become
infinite are found to be 26,044 feet and 6448 feet. Consequently this phenomenon will occur if the depth of the ocean be between
29,182 feet and 26,044 feet, or between 7375 feet and 6448 feet.
