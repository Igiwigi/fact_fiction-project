Molecular Optical Constants.—These are given in the next three tables for all
four salts of the cobalt group. The newly determined densities were employed in
recalculating the values for the three alkali-metal salts. The specific refraction and
dispersion of the ammonium salt are considerably higher than those of the three salts
containing the alkali metals. The molecular dispersion of the ammonium salt is
slightly higher than that of the cesium salt. The molecular refraction, either of
Lorenz or GLADSTONE and Dat, is invariably just higher than that of the rubidium
salt, a fact which is very clearly demonstrated by the mean molecular refraction given
in the last column of the third table.
