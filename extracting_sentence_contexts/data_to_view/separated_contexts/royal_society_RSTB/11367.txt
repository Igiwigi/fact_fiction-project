Episomal-based reprogramming is the most convenient and
widely used protocol and iPSCs derived using this system
have already entered clinical trials for macular degeneration [37]. Not introducing DNA at all increases the safety of repro-
gramming, but is usually less efficient. mRNA or proteins are
quite unstable and require several rounds of transfection to suc-
cessfully reprogramme somatic cells [32,35]. Apart from
increased cell stress, another drawback of these methods is
the fact that the stoichiometry of the reprogramming factors
cannot be controlled, which is a crucial factor for successful
reprogramming. To bypass this drawback, Yoshioka et al. [33]
developed a synthetic polycistronic and _ self-replicating
mRNA molecule containing all four factors. Here, one transfec-
tion is sufficient and the relative abundance of each factor can
be modulated by changing its position within the RNA mol-
ecule.
