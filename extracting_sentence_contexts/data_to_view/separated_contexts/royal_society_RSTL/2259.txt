Hence there is no reason to 8uppose
that the combination of the oxide formed with the acid around it has any direct in-
fluence in producing the electricity evolved, the whole of which appears to be due to
the oxidation of the metal (919.). 941. The alkali, in fact, is superior to the acid in bringing a metal into what is
called the positive state ; for if plates of the same metal, as zinc, tin, lead, or copper,
be used both in the acid or alkali, the electric current is from the alkali across the
cell to the acid, and back through the galvanometer to the alkali, as Sir Humeary
Davy formerly stated*. This current is s0 powerful, that if amalgamated zinc, or tin,
or lead be used, the metal in the acid evolves hydrogen the moment it is placed in
communication with that in the alkali, not from any direct action of the acid upon
it, for if the contact be broken the action ceases, but because it is powerfully negative
with regard to the metal in the alkali. 942.
