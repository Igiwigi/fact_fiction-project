It seems to me that no other
cause than chemical force (a very sufficient one) remains, or is needed to account for
them. 1957. If it be said that, on the theory of chemical excitement, the experiments prove
either too much or not enough, that, in fact, heat ought to produce the same effect
with all the metals that are acted on by the electrolytes nsed, then, I say, that that
does not follow. The force and other cireumstances of chemical affinity vary almost
infinitely with the bodies exhibiting its action, and the added effect of heat upon the
chemical affinity would, necesxarily, partake of these yariations. Chemical action
often goes on without any current being produced ; and it is well known that, in
almost eyery yoltaic circuit, the chemical force has to be considered as divided into
that which is local and that which is current (1120.).
