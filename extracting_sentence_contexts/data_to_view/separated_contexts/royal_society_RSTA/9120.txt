Such standardisation cannot usefully be effected until data are
available which can be regarded as sufficiently near the truth that they are not likely
to be seriously modified by future determinations. The new results of the present
paper, taken in conjunction with those of Wricur, indicate that this stage has been
reached, and that a “ normal” eye for technical colorimetric work can now be adopted
as a standard, with the same status, and limitations as to permanence, as the Inter-
national visibility curve. The number of observers covered by these two investigations is not large, but the
fact that they were tested in two groups, in different institutions, and by different
experimental methods, and that the results of the two groups agree so remarkably well,
gives an authority to the two investigations which neither could have claimed separately,
even had the same total number of observers, or more, been involved ; and shows
that when proper care is taken to obtain suitable experimental conditions, and to
employ properly standardised auxiliary equipment, a close approximation to the
properties of the average eye may be obtained from a comparatively small group of
observers. The two groups, as has been shown, are in agreement for all practical
purposes, and I suggest that the mean of their results are suitable for standardising

as the “normal” colorimetric data for technical purposes to correspond with the
standard “ normal ” visibility data.
