489-492), and to the depth of the cell (p. 493), would afford conditions of molecular
action somewhat similar to those under which Ozone is produced in the presence of phos-
phorus. According to this analogy the Ozone would be due to the action of the carbon»
compounds of the cell on the common oxygen eliminated from carbonic acid by uns
light, and not to the direct action of the sunlight itself. The Ozone thus formed, if nob
instantly evolved from the plant, would be destroyed by the easily oxidizable carbon-
compounds present. Tt is more probable, however, that the Ozone, stated by De Lvca
and others to be observable in the vicinity of vegetation, is due to the intense action of
the oxygen of the air upon the minute quantities of volatile hydrocarbons emitted
by the plants, and to which they owe their peculiar odours, than to any action going
on within the cells. The rapidity of the oxidation in the air of the hydrocarbons,
and the volatile principles of plants generally, goes to fayour the view here snggested;
8 also docs the fact, that Ozone has been observed most readily in the vicinity of Such
plants as are known to emit freely essential oils—as, for instance, those of the Labiate
family. |


_ THE SOURCES OF THE NITROGEN OF VEGETATION, ETC. 495

ce it would appear that, under certain circumstances, Ozone is formed in the im-
te vicinity of some plants, it remains to consider the possibility of its acting, in an
t manner, as a 8ource of combined Nitrogen to our experimental plants—that is,
h the agency of the materials involved in the experiment—and thus compromising
rexult in regard to the question of the appropriation, by the plant itself, of free or
uncombined Nitrogen. It might 80 act :—
