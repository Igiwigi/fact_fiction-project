These results demonstrate the effects of nonlinear TET on the acoustics of uncompressed
ordered granular media, in similarity to TET in the dynamics of discrete oscillators discussed
in the previous section. Specifically, irreversible nonlinear energy transfers from low-to-high
frequencies/wavenumbers have been presented, yielding strong energy redistribution in the
frequency/wavenumber space. This redistribution is caused by the strongly nonlinear (in
fact, nonlinearizable) local Hertzian interactions between granules, which generate essentially
nonlinear acoustics, with no linear counterparts. It is noted that any applied pre-compression
would yield a linear component in the acoustics [36], yet, provided that the pre-compression is
small the previous findings would still hold. On the other hand, strong pre-compression would
generate weakly nonlinear acoustics and the previous strongly nonlinear phenomena would not
expect to hold.
