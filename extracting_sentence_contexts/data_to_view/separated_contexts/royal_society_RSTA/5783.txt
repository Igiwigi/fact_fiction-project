In particular, by assuming that
the pathogen transmission does not depend upon the contact among individuals, the proposed
description (2.1) collapses to the standard approach (1.1) as shown in [18]. In our model, the transition rates can now be assumed to be dependent on the intensity of
social contacts in the compartments. As detailed later, in fact, they are obtained by taking into
account, in a very natural way, the heterogeneity of the population in the form of the variance of
the distributions f;(x, t) [18,23]. This point of view provides a better understanding of the role of
the different individual behaviours in the spreading of a disease [5]. In general, the knowledge of the densities f;(x, t) allows us to evaluate various macroscopic
quantities, independent from the number of contacts, the so-called moments of the distributions,
obtained by integration with respect to the variable x â‚¬ R,.
