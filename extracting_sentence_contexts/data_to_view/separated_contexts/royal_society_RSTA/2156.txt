made the remarks quoted above. Since that time, the mathematics of mock modular forms has, 2 |
in fact, been carried a great deal further and some string theorists now include mock modular

forms in their mathematical toolbox. Unfortunately, it would be too much of a stretch to say â€œ3
that this has brought superstring theory into correspondence with the facts of Nature. It has, oS
however, improved our understanding of one of the best theoretical tests of string theory as a : gS
theory of quantum gravity, namely whether or not it provides a framework in which the entropy 12
of black holes can be understood and computed.
