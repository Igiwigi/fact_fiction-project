Mr. Jacos PERKINS on the compressibility of water, g25

an atmosphere. The piezometer was introduced into the
cannon, and the water forced in until the cap showed signs
of leakage ; the valve at the same time indicating a pressure
of one hundred atmospheres. The piezometer was then
taken out of the cannon, and the flexible ring found to be
eight inches up the rod, evidently proving the rod to have
been forced into the cylinder that distance, showing also a
compression of about one per cent. We have seen by re-
peated experiments, that to be able to produce this degree of
compression, three per cent must be pumped into the gun.
This fact proves, either that the gun expands, or that the
water enters the pores of the cast iron ; it is probable both
these circumstances contribute to produce this effect.

This experiment was made in America in the year 181g,
and before I had time to strengthen my apparatus for the
purpose of making farther experiments, I was obliged to
embark for this country. On my passage, however, I had
frequent opportunities of repeating those I had already made,
and of making others by a natural pressure. They were as
follows. The piezometer, by the assistance of fifty-four
pounds of lead attached to it, was sunk in the ocean to the
depth of five hundred fathoms, which is about equal to the
