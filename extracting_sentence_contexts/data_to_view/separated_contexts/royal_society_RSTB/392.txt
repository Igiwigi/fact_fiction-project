E. B, POULTON ON THE COLOUR-RELATION BETWEEN EXPOSED

investigation, but (probably on account of disturbance) it again wandered for a short
time, passing through another Stage I. of about 44 hours, and then again an
exceedingly short Stage II. of only a little over 24 hours, the final stage being, perhaps, a
little less than normal. These facts throw further light on the stages of certain larvee
which appear to be most abnormally short, and seem at first sight to show that it is
impossible to obtain an average duration for the stages which would be of any
practical value for the investigation of any particular larva. Such a conclusion might
be arrived at by comparing the exceedingly divergent estimates of Stages I. and II. in
Divisions B. and C. of this series, and also by comparing the estimated lengths of the
total periods in these two divisions respectively. But the above-described larva
shows us how after disturbance the whole preparatory period may begin again and all
its stages may be passed through, but that under these circumstances the stages,
and especially the two initial ones, are considerably abbreviated.
