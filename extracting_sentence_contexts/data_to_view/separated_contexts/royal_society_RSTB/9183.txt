The
authors also visualized dendritic exocytosis from oxytocin
and vasopressin neurons when they treated hypothalamic
tissue with tannic acid to ‘freeze’ aggregations of the exocytosed
peptide granules [29-31]. Later microsampling techniques
in vivo confirmed and amplified the data on dendritic vaso-
pressin and oxytocin release and revealed many aspects of its
control [32]. The LDCVs often contain more than one neuropeptide,
and in fact many neurons release a mixture of neuropeptides
[33,34]. For instance, vasopressin coexists with dynorphin
[35], galanin [36], pituitary adenylate cyclase activating poly-
peptide (PACAP) [37] and secretin in MCNs of the SON and
PVN. On the other hand, oxytocin in the SON coexists with
encephalin and dynorphin [38,39].
