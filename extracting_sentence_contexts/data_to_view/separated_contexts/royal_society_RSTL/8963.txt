Similarly, if the electrodes were
transferred in the way just described, not after the maximum effect had been attained,
but at any point during the process of constructing a staircase, the response given to
the next 8hock was of an intensity to make it rank as the next step in the staircase. Hence, shifting the position of the electrodes in no wise modifies the peculiar effect we
are congidering ; and this fact conclusively proves that the effect is a general one per-
yading the whole mass of the contractile tissue, and not confined to the locality which
is the immediate seat of stimulation, Nevertheless this fact does not tend to prove that
the staircase-effect depends on the process of contraction as distinguished from the process
of stimulation, because the waye of the former process must always precede that of the
latter. But, on the other hand, in this connexion it is of the first importance to remember
a fact recently stated, viz. that a current which at the beginning of a series of stimu-
lations is of slightly less than minimal intensity, presently becomes of minimal, and
eventually of much more than minimal intensity—a staircase being thus built up of
which the first observable step (or contraction) only occurs in response to the second,
third, or even fourth shock of the series. This fact, of course, clearly tends to show,
or rather conclusively proves, that the staircase effect, at any rate at its commencement,
depends on the process of stimulation as distinguished from that of contraction ; for it
is obvious that the latter process cannot play any part in thus constructing what we
may term the invisible steps of a staircase.”

To answer the second of the above questions, I placed an Avrelia with its concave
surface uppermost, and removed seven of its lithocysts ; I then observed the spontaneous
discharge of the remaining one, and found it to be conspicuous enough—that after the
occurrence of one of the natural pauses (if this were of sufficient duration) the first
contraction was feeble, the next stronger, the next still stronger, and s0 on, till the
maximum was attained. This natural staircase action admits of being very prettily
shown in another way.
