When this is taken into account there appears to be no discrepancy with the
theoretical predictions.

(c) The CH, twisting and wagging modes

The region between 1370 and 1150 cm~! contains a number of weak absorption bands
which may be considered as splitting out from the 1336 and 1278 cm~! frequencies in the
vibrational spectra of propane. That is to say, they arise from CH, wagging and twisting
modes. The fact that these absorption bands are weak and overlap considerably in the
spectra of the long-chain z-paraffins means that the task of separating them into series
is much more difficult. This is particularly true for the region 1370 to 1320 cm~!, where
water-vapour absorption bands interfere with the experimental study of the spectra. Nevertheless, some progress is possible with the aid of the schematic frequency distribu-
tions shown in figures 6a and 6b.
