ยง 23. Effect of Shaking on the Cells.

The history of these cells illustrates another point. Dr. Horxtyson called our
attention to the fact that he had observed that while slight mechanical shaking did
not affect the E.M.F. of a yood cell it produced considerable change in the E.M.F. of
one which was too low. This fact we have repeatedly verified.

Thus, on August 12, Nos. 41, 45, 46, and 47 were all to low. Their E.M.F. in
each case rose considerably when the cell was tapped, but fell back towards the old
value when the tapping ceased. Cell No. 40 was right, and no effect was produced by
tapping it.

The effect of the shaking would appear to take place through its bringing fresh
zine surfaces into contact with the solution.

A similar result took place with some cells which were too high, only, in this case,
