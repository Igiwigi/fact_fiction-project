of my-experiments,- a'report was! ordered to be made upon
them; and M.- GuyTox: was. the \person- appointed for 'the

some- of his results. His general conclusion. was the same as
mine.

Messrs. | VaugueLin and Fourcroy then- undertook the
subject, and they. were led by it to the confirmation of the
recent discovery of Mons. DescoTILs: | The existence of a
new-metal, which that chemist-had: found in crude platina,
received great sanction from their experiments ; and thus the
discussion upon palladinm has established a fact which will be
considered as interesting, but which would be much more s0,
were we not already overburthened with substances which our
present ignorance obliges us to acknowledge as simple.

No s0oner were these celebrated chemists convinced of the
existence of a new metal; in platina, than they concluded that
it must play a principal part in the composition of palladium.
Shortly after-this, in a note/to a letter from M. ProusrT to M.
VAvguELIN, in which\M. Proust expresses his astonishment
concerning all he has read upon palladium, Mess. Fourcroy
and VAUQUELIN further declare, as their opinion, that this com-
