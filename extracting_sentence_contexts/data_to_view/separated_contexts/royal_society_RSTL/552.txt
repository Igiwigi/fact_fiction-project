The real temperature of
visible flame is perhaps as high as any we are acquainted with,
Mr. TexNanT was in the habit of showing an experiment,
which demonstrates the intensity of its heat. He used to fuse
a small filament of platinum in the flame of a common candle;
and it is proved by many facts, that a stream of air may
be made to render a metallic body white hot, yet not be itself
luminous. A considerable mass of heated metal is required to inflame


118 Sir Humenry Davy on the combustion of

eyen coal gas, or the contact of the same mixture with an
extensive heated surface. An iron wire of =; of an inch and
8 inches long red hot, when held perpendicularly in a stream
of coal gas, did not inflame it, nor did a short wire of one sixth
of an inch produce the effect held horizontally ; but wire of the
same size, when six inches of it were red hot, and when it was
held perpendicularly in a bottle, containing an explosive mix-
ture, so that heat was successively communicated to portions
of the gas, produced its explosion.
