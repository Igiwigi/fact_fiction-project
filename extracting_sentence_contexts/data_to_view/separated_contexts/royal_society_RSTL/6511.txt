Again,
the resultant attraction of the tube on any single particle of the fluid must be in a
direction perpendicular to the surface of the tube, and must therefore be horizontal,
Consequently it can produce directly no force on the particle or on the whole mass of
the fluid column in a vertical direction. 'The direct effect of gravity, on the contrary,
is to drag the whole column of water downwards, and the leading point in the problem
of capillary action is to explain how this tendency of gravity is counteracted. In a question like this, which is merely subsidiary to the general problem treated on
in this paper, it must suffice that I quote those results which are familiar to every one
acquainted with the ordinary investigatious respecting capillary action. Now it is
shown by such investigations that the fluid column A E FB is supported (80 far as regards
any vertical action upon it) in the same manner @s if it were suspended freely from an
infinitely thin and perfectly flexible membrane accurately coinciding with the actual
surface A CB, the particles of the fluid being supposed to adhere to the membrane and
to each other by virtue of the cohesion or attraction between them, without which, in
fact, the ordinary phenomena of capillarity could not exist,

If the column of water in the tube were entirely supported by an upward pressure
on its base EF, then would gravity produce a pres$4re on any horizontal section Q M P,
the whole amount of which would be the weight of the portion of the column above it,
and there would be a corresponding pressure on the inner surface of the tube at P and
Q, tending to push it outwards; but if the column were supported, as aboye snpposed,
at its upper surface, gravity would produce a tension at the horizontal plane QM P, the
whole amount of which would be equal to the weight of the fluid between Q P and the
base BF. Thus the whole column would be in a state of longitudinal tension, and
therefore also, by the fundamental property of fluids, in a state of horizontal tengion—
7.e. the action between the fluid and the inner surface of the solid tube, instead of being
a pressure, must be a tensi0n, supported by the mutual attraction between the particles
of the solid and those of the fluid, supposing the contact between them not to be broken,
This must be the direct effect of gravity in the actual case; and 80 far, therefore, its
tendeney is to contract and not to enlarge the diameter of the tube. There are other causes, however, by which action may be produced between the tube
and the contained fluid.
