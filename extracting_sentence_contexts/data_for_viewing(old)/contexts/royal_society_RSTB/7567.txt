the state of the breakdown reaction. Thus it is high at the beginning of graft-tissue
destruction and thereafter declines sharply. But in grafts where portions of the epithelium
persists for a long time the percentage of these cells remains relatively high. None of
the present grafts broke down without their percentage of immature plasma cells reaching
a predominance. The minimum observed was 58 %, and the only two series which


PLASMA CELLS AND LYMPHOCYTES IN HOMOGRAFTS 499

showed no definite destruction during the experiments failed to attain this percentage,
one of them being the massively infiltrated series 1304. The percentage of immature plasma
cells might therefore be of use as an index of the progress of the host reaction against the
graft. The fact that the plasma cell response may be a characteristic of the individual
would not necessarily affect it, but a low concentration of the cells would probably make
it less reliable.

I would particularly like to express my thanks to Professor P. B. Medawar, F.R.S., and
Dr F. K. Sanders, for help and encouragement throughout this work; to Dr M. R.
Sampford for advice on statistical procedure; to Professor A. C. Hardy, F.R.S., for
facilities provided in the Department of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy of Oxford
University; and to the Beit Medical Fellowship for financial support.
