The general framework presented in §2 served as a starting point for the first studies on the effects
on bioconvection of phototaxis, the ability of some microbial species (e.g. green microalgae [62]
and dinoflagellates [63]) to swim towards a light source (positive phototaxis) or away from it
(negative phototaxis). The light needs to be within the range of wavelengths which the light-
sensitive organelles are sensitive to (approx. 420-500 nm for Chlamydomonas [64]), which overlaps
with—but does not necessarily exactly correspond to—the photosynthetically active range [65].
The pioneering continuum studies of photo-bioconvection [66] considered purely phototactic cell
suspensions that are exposed to uniform illumination from above or below (figure 2a). Swimming
cells are still assumed to be slightly heavier than the ambient fluid, but gyrotaxis and gravitaxis
are neglected and the upswimming is exclusively due to phototaxis. The swimming velocity,
however, depends on the intensity of light I, with positive phototaxis for light intensity below
a critical value I, (I < Ic), and negative phototaxis otherwise (I > I-). This captures the fact that


phototactic organisms move away from intense light to avoid photodamage [27], and results in a
tendency to accumulate cells where I ~ I,. The swimming velocity in equation (2.3) is then

20, I<k,
V=VsT(Dk, where T(I) (3.1)
<0, I>k.

Here k is the vertical unit vector and T(I) is the phenomenological taxis function with values
between —1 and +1 (figure 3a). The shape of the taxis function is, in principle, species dependent,
and is usually constructed based on the simplification of controlled experimental observations
