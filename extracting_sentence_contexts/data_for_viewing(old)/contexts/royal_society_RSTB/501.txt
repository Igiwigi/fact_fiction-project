ramus may, in a good many cases, be tied, cut, and its central end stimulated ; in other cases, it is easier
und more satisfactory to tie the sympathetic above and below the ramus, isolate the portion of the
sympathetic between the ligatures, cnt the grey ramus, if one is present, and stimulate each end of the
sympathetic, I have said that the uppermost white ramus is that running from the first thoracic nerve
to the ganglion stellatum. I have observed the presence of sensory fibres in this in the following way :—
The connections of the ganglion stellatum were cut, with the exception of the white ramus, to the 1st
thoracic nerve and the two limbs of the annulus of Vieussens, the limbs of the annulus of Visussens
were tied, cut, and stimulated near the ganglion stellatum.

I have mentioned above that stimulation of the peripheral ends of the spinal nerves
in the spinal canal does not cause any perceptible reflex action, but it can hardly be
doubted that sensory nerves are distributed to the sheaths of tne spinal nerves; and
it may be said that the result shows that, in fact, the electrical stimulation of a few
sensory fibres does produce no perceptible reflex effect. But this argument involves
the assumption that the sheath of each spinal nerve does not receive its sensory
supply through its own posterior root—an assumption which, so far as I know, is
unfounded, and which is at variance with some of the facts upon which the view of
“recurrent sensibility” is founded.

Some direct evidence against the view that all the large medullated fibres are fibres
of general sensibility of the sympathetic system, is afforded by comparing the degree
of sensitiveness of different parts of the sympathetic with the number of large fibres
in them. I have taken thus the splanchnics, the homologous nerves running to the
inferior mesenteric ganglion, the hypogastric nerves, the lower lumbar and the sacral
sympathetic trunk, and the lumbar grey rami; and I do not find any satisfactory
