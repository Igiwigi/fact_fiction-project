The greater the distance between
these two points, the less certain is the experiment to succeed ; but in many specimens
it may 8ucceed every time, even though the stimulus be applied at the opposite side of
the swimming-bell from that in which the lithocyst is placed. In such cases, however,
it is very important to observe that stimulation of certain tracts of tissue is followed
by this reflex response, while stimulation of other tracts, even though these be situated
much nearer to the lithocyst, is not so followed. Such excitable tracts are by no means
constant as to their position in different individuals ; but the fact of their occurrence
tends to show that the reflex action we are contemplating is effected, not by means of
an equally diffused excitability on the part of the whole nervo-muscular sheet, but by
means of functionally differentiated tissue-tracts, which, during the experiment, act as
afferent nerves. (c) Next I must draw attention to a fact which will presently be proved of the highest
importance in relation to the subject we are considering.
