collider has always seemed an obvious option to follow LEP and it is clearly becoming time
to start R&D on suitable magnets. It is less clear that it is sensible to discuss the physics that
might be studied with such a machine without more complete results from the SPS collider,
let alone data from LEP, SLC and HERA. All we can do is identify the questions which seem
most pressing now and ask how they could be addressed by experiments at an LHC’. The
conclusion of the talk was that: ‘A theoretical consensus is emerging that new phenomena will
be discovered at or below 1 TeV. There is no consensus about the nature of these phenomena but
it is interesting that many of the ideas which have been suggested can be tested in experiments
at an LHC. Although many, if not all, of these ideas will doubtless been discarded, disproved
or established by the time an LHC is built, this demonstrates the potential virtues of such a
machine’.

Very surprisingly, the case for the LHC has in fact remained essentially unchanged for 30 years.
The main emphasis of my talk was on the possibility of discovering the Higgs boson, to which
one and a half pages were devoted (starting with gluon-gluon fusion via a top quark loop, which
was already recognized as probably being the most important production mechanism), followed
by two pages on supersymmetry.

The basic layout of the LHC (2-in-1 superconducting magnets installed in the LEP tunnel, with
the existing PS booster, PS and SPS forming part of the accelerating chain that supplies protons to
the LHC via new transfer tunnels) has not changed since 1984. Most other features were, however,
changed when a detailed design was worked out later (eight crossing points reduced to four,
magnets and the cryo-line installed on the floor in place of LEP, rather than—as then envisaged—
in a combined cryostat above LEP, etc.).
