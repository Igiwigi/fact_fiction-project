OF THE NEMATOIDS, â€”_ AND FREE. 597

-2me 8pecies of free Nematoids, although their FD size has hitherto prevented their

efection.

\ EBERTH 8till believes that the median lines in some Nematoids constitute a part of the

ater-vascular system, whilst WALTER goes much further, and states that they anastomose

ith the lateral vessels, and also send off a number of transverse branches on either side.

'hese transverse branches are what WaLTER formerly described as peripheral nerves,

ut which have now been most conclusively shown by ScaxzipeR and myself to be

aerely transverse prolongations from the muscle-cells to the median lines. SCHNEIDER
