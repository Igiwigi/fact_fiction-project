chemical constitution. ?

The great majority of the active compounds can be defined as stilbenes with a basic substituent,
the position of which is of paramount importance; thus o-dimethylaminostilbene is very much less
active than the f-isomeride, and the m-compound is completely inactive. A further essential feature
is the ethylene bridge, since activity disappears when either of its hydrogen atoms is substituted,
when the bridge is reduced, when it is extended to contain three or four carbon atoms, or when
either methine group is replaced by a nitrogen atom. Compounds in which the ethylene bridge is
absent, or is replaced by oxygen or sulphur, are also inactive, and activity is further dependent
upon the Zrans configuration of the molecule about the ethylenic bond, and to a large extent upon
a free p'-position.

These and other facts have suggested the working hypothesis that one of the features required for
activity is an unbroken conjugation of the amino group with both nuclei, enabling the compound to
assume some dipolar quinonoid character, which depends, among other things, on the co-planar
arrangement of the two benzene nuclei which characterizes the trans form of the stilbenes.

148 A. HADDOW AND OTHERS ON THE GROWTH-INHIBITORY

When evidence concerning steric conditions in the molecules (obtained mainly from the ultra-
violet spectroscopy of 4-dimethylaminostilbene and thirteen of its alkyl derivatives) is compared
with the biological activities of these compounds, a close parallel is suggested between lack of
