the distortion to the second order in any way we please), and the lower limit of the
integral is taken to be zero simply as a matter of convenience.

The addition of a perfectly general function # would be equivalent to the superposition
of a perfectly general distortion (proportional to e’) on to the distortion already under
consideration. The real object of the present analysis is to be found in its ultimate
application to the problem of the rotating fluid, and to solve this problem, it will be
found that » need contain no terms of degree higher than 4 in &, », ¢, this being also
the degree of the other terms in 7. Hence in what follows it will be supposed that
u, contains no terms of degree higher than 4 in &, », ¢

A value of v, is obtainable from equation (38), but there are, as has been seen, many
possible forms for v,, and the most convenient is, in point of fact, obtained by going
back to equation (34), which in a, y, z co-ordinates is

; Hes ( dv, , Ov, C)
Vu t+ fV,+4 (2 252 oe) = Se ty
tat fVest4 (2 Fae + aH) = AD at)
where x may be any function of «, y, z, and \ which vanishes (to the power of e we are
now concerned with) both for \ and 0.
Let two new functions w and w’ be introduced, defined by
