RSGs cluster along a vertical line (as shown in figure 2) known as the Hayashi limit [20]. Cooler
than that, a star will no longer be in hydrostatic equilibrium. The location of the Hayashi limit
shifts to warmer temperatures as the metallicity decreases, and this is consistent with the fact that
the average spectral type shifts to earlier types in lower metallicity systems, as first explained by
Elias et al. [21]. Recently, the effective temperature scale of [18] and subsequent work [22] has been
called into question by Davies et al. [23]. Their results suggest that all RSGs have essentially the
same temperature regardless of spectral type.
