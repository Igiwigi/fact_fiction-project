Another interesting feature is that, as the six

‘

primordia further differentiate, the rounded shoulders of the “ primordial cushions ”
remain on either side of the gyneecial cone, giving the appearance of accessory pro-
tuberances, which at one time are so like the stamen-primordia and just the same size,
that they may be readily mistaken for stamens (fig. 15: 6, and fig. 16: 7; bud
0°53 mm. high). Thisin fact is what happened. McN as (1872) figures these apparent
sets of three primordia on either side of the gyncecium, omitting the lower lateral
stamens altogether. SrraspurGER (1872) missed the intermediate stages.
