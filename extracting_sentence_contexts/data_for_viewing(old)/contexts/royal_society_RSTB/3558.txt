At, or in front of the constriction, again, lies another pair of neuromeres, also
connected by a proliferative cellular connection with the anterior margin of the base
of the trigeminal lobe.

No previous writer has described more than two pairs of hind-brain neuromeres in
front of our first prefacial neuromere. ‘The neuromeric relations and connections of
the Trigeminus have been variously stated. All descriptions concur in the recognition
of its connection with a neuromere next in front of the easily identified first-prefacial
of our classification. Biraneck (87) in the chick, Frorrep (’92) in the mole, and
Broman (’95) in man, all allege the existence of a connection between the Trigeminus
and our first-prefacial neuromere itself. Such a connection is undoubtedly lacking in
our specimens of Ornithorhynchus, and the generally recognised absence of nerve-
connection has in fact earned for this neuromere the designation of “ nervenlos ” from
v. Kuprrer (loc. cit., p. 264). Whilst emphasising its barren character, NEAL, however,
remarks that “late in its development the fibres of the sensor root of the Trigeminus
connect with its convexity” (Joc. cit., p 248) in Squalus. A persistent commissural
portion of a neural crest continuous, in front, with the Trigeminus Anlage, may, in some
cases, have simulated an actual trigeminal connection with this neuromere.

Locy and Hitt maintain the existence of a nerve-connection between the “anterior
