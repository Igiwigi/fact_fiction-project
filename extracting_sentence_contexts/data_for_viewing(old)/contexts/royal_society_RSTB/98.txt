adapted to its life as a parasite in the roots of the Leguminose that it has come to
stimulate and tax its host in an exquisitely well-balanced manner, and has lost its
needless true resting-spores because the more numerous and tiny sprouting yeast-
cells (gemmules) are kept in the cells of the tubercle through the dry summer
and autumn, and freed during the rotting in the soil in the winter and spring.
Their very minuteness and numbers enable these “germs” to become as ubiqui-
tous as “ Bacteria” or ordinary “ Yeast” forms, thus explaining the ubiquity of the
tubercles.

Breretp has shown that the ordinary resting-spores of the Ustilaginee, which
usually take a long time to germinate in pure water, will germinate much more rapidly
in nutritive solutions, and that several species can be made to develope their promycelia
in nutritive solutions which had hitherto been cultivated in vain. The curious fact
comes out, however, that when thas germinating in nutritive solutions the promycelia
go on budding off yeast-like cells, which multiply still further by budding, and thus

extend the parasite outside the plant enormously, According to BrEFELp’s discoveries,

whereas some forms, such as Ustilago destruens,* first develope a definite mycelium
from the resting-spore, and the yeast-like cells are budded off from this into the air,
in other cases the budding commences at once on the germination of the spore. Thus,
