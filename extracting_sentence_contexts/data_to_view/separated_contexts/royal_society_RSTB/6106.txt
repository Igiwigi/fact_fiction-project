Fic. 14—Schematic diagram intended to define the effect of conditions of constant temperature
and humidity upon Glossina tachinoides, offered food daily. s = mean survival of 9 in days ;
b = births per 100 9 days ; m = mean weight of meal in mg.

humidities are less favourable, whether judged by appetite, survival or reproduction,
and humidities of 65°/, and over are even more unfavourable. We are, therefore,
perhaps justified in publishing such a diagram as fig. 14, provided it is accepted as
tentative. For there are large areas in the graph for which no facts are available ;
moreover, when knowledge is more complete, it will be found that the limits of
temperature and humidity are not the same for different activities, so that it is
scarcely legitimate to express appetite, length of life, and birth-rate in one figure. Using it with caution, fig. 14 shows a favourable zone round 30°C and 44%
humidity extending downwards perhaps to 19° humidity ; that is to say, over a
