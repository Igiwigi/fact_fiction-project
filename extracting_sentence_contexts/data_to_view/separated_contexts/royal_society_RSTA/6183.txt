It is really only for the non-ignorable model that we see significant differences in inference
based on whether we treat inconclusives as observed or missing. For both models, the estimated
proportion of errors in a study is much higher than for either the naive or ignorable model. This

is not particularly surprising given the fact that the MLEs for the hyper-parameters resulted in ‘3
priors that indicated examiners would be unlikely to respond in the event of an error (i.e. a prior : s
that assumed 79;’s were centred close to 0) for both datasets. The predicted error rate increased : S
substantially when inconclusives were treated as missing. This is likely due to the combination {=
of the difference in MLEs (i.e. the MLE for jz» was higher when inconclusives were treated as 8
missing than when they were treated as observed) and the incredibly high non-response rates. : =
The non-response rate when inconclusives are treated as observed is 48.5% (note we are dropping : =
the distinction between unit and item non-response for the moment).
