use with dynamic applications with composite and rubber materials [17,64]. Several previous DN
studies also show that the selection of virtual fields is an important point regarding the accuracy :a

and robustness of the identification method [65]. Therefore, it is necessary to first examine the : S

robustness and sensitivity of the identification method according to the chosen special virtual
fields. The data obtained from using one of the full-field techniques (i.e. grid method or digital
image correlation) in an actual experiment are in fact displacement fields that are discretized
over a region of interest. Therefore, effects produced by noise on the identification procedure are
closer to the actual effects that occur during actual experiments. These effects can be investigated
by directly corrupting the numerically simulated displacement fields. Here, the displacements are
extracted at nodal points that constitute 1 mm FE mesh of observed region in the numerical model.
Owing to the size of the observed region the spatial resolution of the extracted displacement fields
is 24 x 121 yielding 2094 measurement points. In the present case, the virtual fields are deduced
from the actual measurements so as to maximize both terms in equation (2.4) at each time step.
The displacement fields are averaged in the y-direction, and a polynomial fitting is applied so
that the afterwards expanded virtual fields only depend on x. In this way, a certain amount of
spatial noise is already being filtered out by averaging the displacement maps in vertical direction,
while polynomial curve fitting allows for spatial smoothing in horizontal direction. In order to
validate the performance of the used virtual fields, numerically simulated displacement maps
