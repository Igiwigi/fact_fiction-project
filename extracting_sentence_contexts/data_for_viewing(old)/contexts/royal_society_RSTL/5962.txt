Srarious observations the author is persuaded that this tissue is @ development from the
Seqmental organ (at fig. 16, a 8ingle cirrus filled with this ovarian tissue (d) and its blood-
Frexsels is figured), and that in size and vascularity it is proportionate to the stage at
Svhich the contained germinal elements have arrivedF,
> In the Nereid group generally the female is much larger than the male. This differ-
Fence is very striking in AN. lamelligera and N. renalis. The cephalic extremity of these
Svorms is entirely destitute of the © segmental organ,” This is also remarkably the case
gn Nephthys Hombergii, The nervous chord in this cesophageal region is highly deve-
oped in all the Nereid group.
6 This feature of structure is also very prominent in the Ariciadeef. The segmental
Srgan in this family is limited in its distribution to the two posterior thirds of the body.

+ VUntil 1 came to study the generative system of the Annelids, I always looked upon the florid and
brightly vascular elements of the feet as specially designed-to fulfil a respiratory Function. I am now con-
vinced that, if this purpose is fulfilled at all, it is only 80 incidentally. The great and paramount office of
these specially developed parts of the vascular system is to supply the means of growth to the generative
organ. Tt is now almost certain that what Mirxe-Epwaroms has called the © branchial hearts,” in the
Eunicide, are sacculated developments of the yessels designed to supply the reproductive system.
