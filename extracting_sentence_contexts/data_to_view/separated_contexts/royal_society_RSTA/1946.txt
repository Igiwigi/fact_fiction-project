We should
naturally seek to compare the first with the S waves and the second: with the
P waves, while there is no necessary connexion between the two except that they
arrive together, and the vibration should be in the azimuth plane. It must, of
course, be understood that in making any such comparisons we assume what is not
at all likely to be the case, viz., that waves starting from the origin are symmetrical

about the origin. We are, in fact, simply estimating the changes due to reflexion

without considering the other circumstances that may lead to differences in the
relative magnitude of P and ยง and their reflexions. We may best illustrate the possibilities by taking the theoretical case 8500 km.,
which corresponds closely to fig. 5.
