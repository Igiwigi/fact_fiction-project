Whether, moreover, the errors brought to light by Colonel Evernsy
solely from local attraction, or from local attraction combined with some local peculi
in the curvature of the Indian Arc, was not apparent ; 80 that the subject of local attrac-
tion, and its influence on geodetic operations in this country, was still involved in obsen-
rity, and the anomalies of the Indian Are remained unexplained in the papers which 1
have hitherto forwarded to the Society. In the present communication I think amhi-
guity is removed. It is demonstrated that no peculiarity in the curvature of the are
can produce any part of the errors brought to light by Colonel EvEREsT; that those
errors arise solely from local attraction ; that they are in fact the exact measure of the
difference of the resultant local attraction at the two extremities of each arc, from what-
ever causes the attraction may arize—mountains, ocean, or crust ; lastly, it is proyed
that there are hidden causes in the crust below the Indian Arc, and the differences of
their resultant effect upon the stations of the arc are computed. An inference from
these results is, that the relative position of places in a Map, laid down from geodetic
operations, is accurate, being altogether unaffected by local attraction ; though the
position of the Map itself on the terrestrial spheroid will be dependent upon the
observed latitude of some one station in it, and that observed latitude will be affected
by the local attraction at that place. To determine the absolute latitude in some one
station connected with the geodetic operations is $till a desideratum.
