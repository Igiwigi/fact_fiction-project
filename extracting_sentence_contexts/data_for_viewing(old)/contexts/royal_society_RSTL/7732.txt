«T have been able to verify the observations of Mr. LockyER on the swn, but I find
that, even where the lines do not become brilliant, their blackness vanishes by a partial
inversion. T have found also some luminous lines which become exceedingly brilliant
near the edge of the xun. One is near the ray D, and the other in contact almost with
the line B on the side of C.

« T find that all around the full limb of the sun the inversion takes place. If the slit

is perpendicular to the edge the inversion is a very short part, 0 by of

10” or 15”, but if the slit is parallel to the edge then the inversion is complete. It is a very
beautiful fact. It is perhaps one that will modify our ideas on the origin of these lines.”
T have italicized the most important part of the letter.
Since the 20th of the present month, in consequence of a conversation on that day
with Mr. Ds La Rus, I have gone over my observations of the sun's limb with great
care, and have also reexamined Mr. Ds La Ruz's photographs with a view to ascertain
the evidence which they give of the continuity of the envelope. The result strongly
confirms my former views. It is true that the photographs do not show a continuous
chromosphere of anything like uniform thickness ; but that arises from the fact that the
only part of the swn's limb where the envelope was visible at all during totality
happened to be covered by irregular prominences, which were probably very abundant
at the time. In fact, owing to the relative sizes of the swn and moon during the eclipse
of 1860, and the direction of the moon's motion, the top and bottom of the sun's limb,
as shown in plate 15 of Mr. De La Rux's memoir, were considerably within the moon's
