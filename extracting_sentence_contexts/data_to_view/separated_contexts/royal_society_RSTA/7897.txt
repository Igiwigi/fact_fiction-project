With regard to the yard, it is suggested that advantage might be taken of the oppor-
tunity afforded by its re-definition in terms of wave-lengths of light to choose the
definition in such a manner that the simple approximate ratio of 1 yard = 0-9144 metre
(or 1 inch = 25-4 mm.) should for the future be accurately true. This simple factor
differs by less than 2 parts in 10Â° from the true value at the present time (vide section 7). It is closely the mean between the yards at present current in Great Britain and the

United States, and is, in fact, already generally employed in both countries for industrial
purposes. Its adoption, moreover, would appear to be not without some historical
justification, which it is hoped to discuss in a later paper. There is reason to hope
that a similar definition might also be adopted by the United States and thus end the
present slight divergence between the yards of the two countries.
