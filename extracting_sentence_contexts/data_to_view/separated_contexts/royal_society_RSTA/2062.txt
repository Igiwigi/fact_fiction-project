Despite their restricted character, the answers provided by extended thermodynamics to the
previously mentioned conceptual questions may be a useful guide to more general situations,
and they are helpful to give to the mentioned answers some more precise and concrete forms. For instance, the reduction of the extended entropy with respect to the local-equilibrium entropy
may be physically interpreted in two different but complementary and mutually consistent ways. On the one side, the reduction arises from the entropy produced by the relaxation of the fluxes
during their decay towards their zero equilibrium value after the system (in fact, a small volume
of the system) has been suddenly insulated. A second interpretation is in terms of the reduction
of the number of accessible microscopic states when the system is submitted to a non-vanishing
heat flux. These interpretations may take concrete explicit forms in the kinetic theory of gases
[5,7,14,17] or in maximum-entropy approaches [7,9,11,12], where the non-equilibrium distribution
function f is obtained, in terms of the local equilibrium quantities and of the fluxes acting on the
system (or on the gradients present in the system), so that the calculation of the entropy in terms
of the integral of f log f may be carried out, leading to the local equilibrium entropy plus some
explicit corrections.
