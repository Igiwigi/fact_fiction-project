(5) A knowledge of the change in the specific volume of water vapour with
pressure—this knowledge we assume is given by ReGgnautt’s work. Choice of Solute. Owing to the fact that, in the direct measurement of osmotic pressures, the copper
ferrocyanide membrane is semipermeable to but few substances, the choice is strictly
limited. In calcium ferrocyanide a substance was found which seemed likely to throw
considerable light on osmotic phenomena. Aqueous solutions of this substance have the following properties :—The copper
ferrocyanide membrane is practically impermeable to the salt.
