In these cases, figure 4b indicates that the
phase between the vortex and fibre motion increases the minimum distance between the two,
leading to a weaker acoustic emission. For the largest oscillating frequency considered, w = 10,
it is clear that prescribed fibre motion modulates the acoustic signal and leads to large increases
in the acoustic noise level. These results are consistent with the fact that a larger relative velocity
between the vortex and fibre when in close proximity leads to peaks in the acoustic signature. The high oscillation frequency also affects the vortex trajectory, bringing the vortex nearer the
fibre and breaking strongly the left-right symmetry of the vortex path. The qualitative parametric trends for € = 0 also hold when a mean flow of magnitude € = 1 is
introduced in figures 5 and 6.
