In, perhaps, the majority of cases, the transition forms are best seen between
thyroid and internal parathyroid; but in the case of the ox, such a transition is
shown between thyroid and external parathyroid (Plate 13, fig. 18); and in the case
of the human gland shown in Plate 12, figs. 12, 13, 14, it is the external parathyroid
which contains typical colloid vesicles. Further, it was the external parathyroids in
the experiments of Vincent and Jonny which, after removal of the thyroid, became
converted into a tissue resembling the latter. So that, although some authors have
been inclined to look upon external and internal parathyroids as separate and distinct
organs, the present series of observations does not lend any support to the view that
either one is less intimately connected with the thyroid than the other.

_The nature of this relationship is, however, by no means clear. As stated above,
the facts of embryology cannot be ignored. It seems to be well ascertained that the
parathyroids are developed from the epithelium of the third and fourth gill-clefts,
while the thyroid is derived from the median rudiment on the ventral wall of the
embryonic pharynx. Moreover, the two structures do not arise at the same time, and
many embryologists believe that parathyroids only secondarily enter into relation
with the thyroid. It is not, however, to be imagined that the primitive epithelial
outgrowths, constituting the buds of thyroid, parathyroid, thymus, and other
branchial cleft organs, can be very different from each other. Thus the material of
the thymus, when first laid down, is indistinguishable from that of the parathyroid,
and if, for any reason, in any particular species, the usual lymphatic metamorphosis
did not occur, I imagine that the tissue would be looked upon as parathyroid, that is,
if its point of origin were not definitely known.
