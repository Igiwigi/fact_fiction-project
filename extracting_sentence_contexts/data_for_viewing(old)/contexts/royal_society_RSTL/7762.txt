AF+BG++CH=0, we have the eighth species, S(1, 3), with a directris line and «
directris skew cubic met twice by each generating tine. We exclude this particular case,
and in the tenth species consider the relation AF+BG+CH=0 as not satisfied, and
therefore the scroll as not having a directrix line,

62. T consider how the scroll may be obtained as a scroll S(m?, n) generated by a line
meeting a curve of the order m twice and a curve of the order 2 once. The first curye
will be the skew cubic, that is m=3; the s8econd curve may be any plane section of the
scroll; such a section will be a quartic curve having three nodes, one at each intersection
of its plane with the skew cubic. Conversely, if we have a skey cubic, and a plane
quartic meeting the skey cubic in three points, each of them a node on the quartic, then
the scroll generated by the lines which meet the skeyy cubic twice and the quartic once
will be a quartic scroll. In fact (se First Memoir, No. 10, and Second Memoir, No, 5)
the order of the scroll is given by the formula S(nz?, n)=n([m]+M)—reduction,
=16—reduction. And in the present case the reduction arises (Second Memoir, No. 4)
from the cones having their vertices at the intersections of the skew cubic and the
quartic, and passing through the skew cubic. Each cone is of the order 2, and each
intersection qu@ double point on the quartic gives a reduction 2X order of cone, =4;
that is, the reduction arising from the three intersections is =12; or the order of the
scroll is 16—12, =4,

63. We may, instead of the section by a plane in general, consider the section by a
plane through a generating line ; the section is here made up of the generating line and
of a plane cubic passing through each of the two points of intersection of the generating
line with the skew cubic, and having a node at the remaining intersection of its plane
