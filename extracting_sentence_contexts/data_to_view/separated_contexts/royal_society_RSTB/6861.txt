MACFADYEN ON DORSET LIAS FORAMINIFERA

are obliquely transverse; the inner margins make no attempt to embrace the previous
chambers as in F. inaequilateralis, where even the later chambers of the cristellarian
series come near to touching the protoconch. F. semicristellaria Schwager (1867, p. 656, plate 34, figure 11), from the Bajocian of
Germany, may be compared, but it differs in the marked absence of coiling in the
early cristellarian chambers. The Upper Cretaceous F. rugosa with which Brady and Blake identified their speci-
mens is, in fact, unmistakably distinct. According to Cushman (1935, Contr. Cushman
Lab. 11, 83, plate 13, figures 1-6), it was defectively figured by dâ€™Orbigny.
