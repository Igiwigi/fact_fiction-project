It remains to place on record, however, the existence in the specimens
examined of a number of higher mycelial forms of fungi, which, different as they are
in detail, may all be regarded as of the nature of “ moulds.” Looking at all that is known of the lumps of Ginger-beer plant, and how they
are handed about in the fresh state, and remembering the way the ordinary fermenta-
tions are carried on in country houses, &c., it might be predicted off-hand that all
kinds of spores of common mould-fungi would get into the mixtures and contaminate
them. As matter of fact, I never had a specimen of the Ginger-beer plant sent to
me that did not contain several species of these mould-fungi. I attribute the
presence of these intruders to three chief sources :—

(1.) To the ingredients employed—ordinary unboiled epring-, well-, or tap-water,
common sugar and ginger direct from the grocer’s, and, of course, unsterilised.
