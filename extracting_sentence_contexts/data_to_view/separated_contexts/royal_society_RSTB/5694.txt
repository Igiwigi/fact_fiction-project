In
many of the experiments, however, the displacements could not be estimated at all,
because the lateral bundle of the leaf with which the second primordium made contact
had been disturbed by the cut. The displacement of the second primordium was
always towards the wound, and was nearly always greater after isolation of I, than of Py. It must have contributed towards the increase in the divergence angle between the
first and second primordia, and the fact that it was greater after isolation of I, must have

contributed towards making the increase in this angle greater after isolation of l.
(It may here be noted that in speaking of “ displacements ” it is never intended that
a primordium is actually moved from one place to another, but merely that it arises
in some position other than its normal position.)

(8) A First Factor causing Displacement of the Second Younger Primordium. It must next be considered whether this displacement of the second primordium can
be interpreted in terms of the hypothesis of the “ first available space.”
