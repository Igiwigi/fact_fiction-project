without metallic or any additional contact. To observe this with the apparatus,
fig. 14., a drop of water was put in at 6, At first there was no chemical action and
no electric current, though the water was there, 80 that contact with the water did
nothing : the water and acid were moved and mixed together by means of the end of
the wire 4; in a few moments proper chemical action came on, the iron evolving
nitrous gas at the place of its action, and at the same time acquiring a positive con-
dition at that part, and producing a powerful electric current.

2040. When the chemical action which either has or could have produced a current
in one direction is reversed or undone, the current is reversed (or undone) als0.

2041. This is a principle or result which most strikingly confirms the chemical
theory of voltaic excitement, and is illustrated by many important facts. Vorra in
the year 1802*, showed that crystallized oxide of manganese was highly negative to
zinc and similar metals, giving, according to his theory, electricity to the zinc at the
point of contact. BrcqusreL worked carefully at this subject in 18354, and came
to the conelusion, but reservedly expressed, that the facts were favourable to the
theory of contact. In the following year Dg 14a Rive examined the subjectf, and
shows, to my satisfaction at least, that the peroxide is at the time undergoing che-
mical change and losing oxygen, a change perfectly in accordance with the direction
of the current it produces.

2042. The peroxide associated with platinum in the green nitrous acid originates a
current, and is negative to the platinum, at the same time giving up oxygen and con-
verting the nitrous acid into nitric acid, a change easily shown by a common che-
