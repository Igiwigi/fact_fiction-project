months. In the infants at birth it has attained a greater size than it has either before or
afterwards, but as childhood adyances it becomes rather smaller than the adult average.
Thus, if prognathism were to be taken as meaning projection of the face from under-
neath the floor of the anterior cranial fossa, infants would have to be considered as
exhibiting the maximum of prognathism, notwithstanding that in them the face is far
smaller in proportion to the cranium than it is in the adult. Observation on the living
subject will fully verify in this respect the results of the measurements here given;
for it will be readily seen that in infants and young children the swm of the orbito-frontal
and orbito-nasal angles is much greater than in the adult. After birth the orbito-nasal
angle diminishes apparently pari pass with the increase in the orbital length, dependent
on the growth of the anterior lobes of the brain; but the orbital length is further in-
creased at puberty by the enlargement of the frontal sinuses; and it is a remarkable and
important fact that this is not accompanied with a further diminution of the orbito-nasal
angle, but, there being about that time apparently a general growth of the face-bones,

the whole mesial extent of the face is brought forwards, and the nasal spine often eyen
more than the root of the nose.

In the adult the range of variation of this angle is great, but is principally dependent
on individual peculiarity, not at all on sex, and only to a limited extent on race. The
extremes are 79* in the German skull 33, and 103? in the Hottentot skull 87. In
almost all the nationalities of which seyeral specimens haye been examined, there is a
