monomethyl-narcotine may be narcotine, where H, replaces (CH,), in the meconic
radical, or where I replaces CH, in the cotarnine radical as well as in the meconin
radical.

Hence either of the two following reactions with heated water might be anticipated —

Monomethyl-nornarcotine. Normeconin. Cotarnine.
C1 Hig (CH,) NO, = C,H, O, + Cy Hyg (CH,) NO,,
or
Methyl-normeconin. Cotarnimide,
Ci, Hig (CH,) NO, = C, H, (CH) O, + Cy Hy NO,.
On trying the experiment it was found impossible to obtain anything but tarry masses :
the fact that methyl-normeconin was not obtained would tend to show that the former
reaction takes place, the normeconin immediately becoming decomposed ; the cotarnine,
however, could not be got sufficiently free from tar for analysis.
Similarly, with oxidizing agents either of the following reactions appears probable :—

Monomethyl-nornarcotine, Noropianic acid. Cotarnine,
Cy Hig(CHz) NO; + O = C, Hg O, + Cy Hyg (CH) NO,,
or
Methyl-noropianic acid. Cotarnimide.

Cy Hy (CH,) NO, + O = C,H; (CH,) O; + Cy Hy NO,.

The non-oxidizing agents, and ferric chloride, only gave rise to the formation of
