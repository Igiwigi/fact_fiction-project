tric organs cannot be considered otherwise than as a pile of elementary organs, upon
each of which a nervous filament is spread normally to the axis of this pile. Now a
cylinder of cast iron enclosed in a helix of metallic wire, and traversed by the electric
current, is evidently an apparatus analogous to a prism of the electric organ of the
fisgh at the moment when the nervous influence excites the discharge.

On one side we have the two opposite states of electricity, the tension of both of
which anust, increase at the extremities of each prism in proportion to the number of
elementary organs of which it is composed ; on the other hand, we have opposite
magnetic 8tates, the strength of which at the poles is also proportional to the number
of magnetic elements of the cylinder.

Experience has in fact shown, both in the torpedo and in the gymnotus, that the
strength of the current obtained during the discharge is proportional to the length of
the prisms included in the circuit closed, I haye frequently seen, on dividing the
electric organ of the living torpedo in a plane parallel to the surface of the organ,
that: the 8um of the, currents given by the different slices of the organ were approx-
imatively equal to the current given by the entire organ, These same facts are verified
also by including different points of the electric organ of the torpedo in the circuit ;
we know, in effect, that the current is stronger when points near the median line of
the animal are touched, than when more remote points are.. Nothing is easier than
