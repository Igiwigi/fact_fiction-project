For example, downscaling has been used by the Asian Cities
Climate Change Resilience Network in preparing resilience strategies for Indian cities [24]. However, projections of future weather patterns from different climate models disagree, and
these disagreements tend to be greatest for the kind of information that is most relevant for
local climate risk assessment (e.g. short- or medium-term highly localized projections) [26,27]
Socio-economic trends, which will influence the impact of climate change on urban areas, also
suffer from inherent uncertainty [28]. In fact, the climate dimension just adds to the uncertainty
derived from the wide range of socio-economic and environmental factors considered, often
referred to as the ‘cascade of uncertainty’ or the ‘uncertainty explosion’ [29-31]. Jongman et al. [32]
showed that vulnerability is an important driver of disaster damage and annual hazard variability
alone only explains a minor part of the observed variation in the recorded damage. However,
there is often scarcity of reliable data for predicting future vulnerability, as it tends to be highly
endogenous to the behaviour of private and public agents before, during and immediately after a
disaster [6,33].
