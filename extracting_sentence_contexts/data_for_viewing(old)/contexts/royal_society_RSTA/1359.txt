As shown in [32], this basic design can be used as a building block for a large class of
non-isometric origami: Two circular patterns with bisecting straight-line interface can form two
equal-height cones with parallel axes after actuation, as depicted in figure 4b. Furthermore,
symmetrically patterned circular patterns with bisecting interfaces can form objective non-isometric
origami in figure 4c—e. We construct three examples by applying the two-dimensional translation
group on the ‘unit cell’. The unit cell 2 of the reference domain is a square, a rhombus, or a


Figure 4. (a) A circular director pattern and its corresponding actuated cone. The circumference 2zrr contracts by a factor A
upon actuation. The in-material radius r extends by A~”, since it is perpendicular to the director. The cone angle ¢ is then
given by y = arcsin A’. These facts are encoded in the cone deformation y, (r) in the text. (b) Two circular director patterns
separated by a bisecting straight-line interface (red line). The actuated state is two cones meeting together with the same
height. (c—e) 2D symmetric pattern and their actuated configurations. The centres of cones (black dots) form square, triangular
and hexagonal lattices. (Online version in colour.)

the group generator #; = (I|t,) for the deformed domain has ¢; = At;, for i= 1,2. We list the unit cells
