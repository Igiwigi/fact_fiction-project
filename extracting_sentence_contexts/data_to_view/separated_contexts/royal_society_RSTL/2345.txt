Ina paper which I had the honour to address to the Royal Society about
twenty years ago (in the year 1807) upon the Economy of Bees, I stated, that
having adapted cavities in hollow trees for the reception of swarms of those
insects, I had observed that several days previous to the arrival of a swarm, a
considerable number of bees were constantly employed in examining the state
of the tree, and particularly of every dead knot above the cavity which ap-
peared likely to admit water into it. At that period it appeared to me rather
extraordinary, that animals 80 industrious as bees. and 80 munch disposed to
make the best nse of their time, should, at that important season of the year,
waste 80 much of it in apparently useless repetitions of the same act : for I, at
that time, supposed that on different days, and at different periods of the same
day, I saw only the same individuals. But in a case which at a subsequent
period came under my observation, where the cavity into which the bees
apparently proposed to enter, was not more than a quarter of a mile distant
from the hive whence a swarm were prepared to emigrate, I witnessed a very
rapid change of the individuals who visited their future contemplated habi-
tation ; and the number which in the course of three days entered it, appeared
to me to he fully equal to constitute a very large 8warm : and upon the
evidence of these and other facts, which I shall proceed to state, I am much
disposed to infer, that not a single labouring bee ever emigrates in a swarm
without having seen the future proposed habitation of that swarm. That the
queen bee has also always seen her future habitation, T am also much inclined
to believe, as he is well known to absent herself from the hive some time
previously to the emigration of a swarm : though her object may be to meet a
male of another hive ; for I much doubt whether she ever receives the embraces
of a brother. The results of some of Hupex's experiments are very fayourable
