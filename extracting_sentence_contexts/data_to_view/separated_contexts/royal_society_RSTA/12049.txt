B. DIXON ON THE RATE OF EXPLOSION IN GASES. The fact that the rate of explosion of hydrogen and chlorine exceeds the calculated
velocity of the sound-wave, as calculated from THomsen’s Heat of Combination
(22,000 cals.), is possibly due to the behaviour of the unburnt chlorine in the wave-
front. The rates agree fairly with the sound-wave calculated from the mean heat of
combination, which I have given in the table. Car.
