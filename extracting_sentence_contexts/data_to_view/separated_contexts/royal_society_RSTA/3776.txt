A rather ‘passive’ use of light in OAM modes is the design of trapping and guiding geometries
that confine atoms to regions of maximal or minimal light intensity for light below or above
the atomic resonance frequency, respectively. Section 2 describes how atoms can be guided in
free space and through hollow core fibre, and confined within the evanescent field of OAM
modes propagating through nanofibres. These applications rely on the characteristic intensity
structure of OAM modes and their superpositions, but they do not involve any transfer of angular
momentum between light and matter, and in fact, leave the internal atomic state unchanged. Coherent, and hence phase preserving, light-matter interaction instead offers us ideal
conditions to respond to the spatially varying phase of OAM light, and in particular to transfer
angular momentum between light and matter, as discussed in §3. It has been predicted and
observed that OAM light can exert a torque on atomic clouds and BECs, inducing a mechanical
rotation.
