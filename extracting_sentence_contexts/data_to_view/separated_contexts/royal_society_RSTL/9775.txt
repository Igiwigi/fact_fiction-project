This diminution of relaxation at the commoence-
ment of each group is clearly not due to any mechanical action of the auricular contractions ; for, as is
een in all the figures, and especially in fig. 18, where the maximum contractions of the anricles occurred
before the ventricle began to beat, those contractions cansed no appreciable effect upon the position of
the ventricular lever. I am inclined, therefore, to think that it is possible that the increase of the contraction force caused by
the action of the vagus nerve may be accompanied by an increase of tonicity, and that the diminution in
the contraction force is certainly accompanied by a diminution of tonicity. I am the more emboldened to
consider this a possibility by the fact that AuperT® has already, from observations on the action of the
Dog's heart, suggested that cardio-tonic nerves for the heart exist, and by their action cause the greater
relaxation which exists during the stimulation of the vagus and the diminution of relaxation which he
noticed after the end of the stimulation of the nerve. The effect of atropin, muscarin, and eurare upon the action of the vagus. Before mentioning the effect of these poisons upon the vagus action, T will endeavour
to &um up briefly their actions upon the motor ganglia and the muscular tissue
respectively, as far, at least, as can be judged from these present experiments.
