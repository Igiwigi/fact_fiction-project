I saw it in mature ova half-way between the surface and
the centre of the yelk,â€”a locality which was remarkable from the fact, that ante
coitum, and even while the ovum is yet immature, the germinal vesicle is seen to
have passed to the surface of the yelk. Now such a situation of the germinal yesicle
would probably have escaped wy attention, if the observation had not been many
times repeated. Yet on a knowledge of the fact that the germinal vesicle returns to
the centre of the yelk, depends the possibility of fully understanding the oyum in
some of its future phases.

132. I shall now describe the changes apparently resulting from sexual connexion,
obseryed in the ovum of the Rabbit while still within the ovary. Some minute details
will be unavoidable, but so far as is consistent with perspicuity I shall endeavour to
be brief.
