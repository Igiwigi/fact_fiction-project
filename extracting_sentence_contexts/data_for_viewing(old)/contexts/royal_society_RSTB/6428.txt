Litt and JuHN summarily dismiss the theory that the rhachis is formed by
fusion of barbs, saying “ This is however, incorrect. . . . The two dorsalmost barbs
are laid down and become pigmented and keratinized while still separate from one
another. After that there can be no fusion except at their undifferentiated bases ;
it is at their bases, as a matter of fact, that the shaft proper begins by a fusion of the
two half-rings of the collar to which the bases of the first barbs, as well as those of all
succeeding barbs have a primary attachment.” (Pp. 142-143.)

If successive cross-sections of a feather are taken from tip to base, it will be seen that
the two most apical barbs fuse to form the rhachis before cornification commences,
and since the feather is growing only at the base, this fusion is really a combination
of their growing basal regions. In fact, the process of cornification does not usually
begin until several barbs have thus fused. When sections are taken through older
feathers in which cornification has proceeded almost to the base, there might appear
superficial grounds for such a statement. Actually, the tips of the barbs are keratinized
before the bases, but it must be remembered that growth takes place in the reverse
direction (7.e., base to tip) and fusion of barbs occurs before cornification has begun.
There is thus no justification for the first part of the above quotation.

It has already been pointed out (Hosker, 1934) that ridge formation is a passive
cutting up of the intermediate cells, and these divisions curve round the feather
germ in such a way that a ridge which at first lay ventrally, would ultimately fuse
with the rhachis at the dorsal point. There is thus no suggestion of a movement of
cells, except the early grouping of cells into barb and barbule plates, or of a movement
