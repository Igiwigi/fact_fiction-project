equation to three one-dimensional scattering Schrédinger equations in each set of coordinates G =
A,B,C equal to equation (2.6). Note that, by construction of the multiple R-matrix boundaries, the
reduced potential U connecting channels that scatter in different coordinates should be negligible
compared to the scattering energy.


(iv) Energy-dependent scattering using RmatReact methodology

Non-reactive scattering. The mathematics here has been discussed by Tennyson ef al. [25] and
is summarized here to make clear the differences in treatment necessary between non-reactive
scattering (the simplest kind of process) and the other processes, particularly reactive scattering.

We have discussed earlier the fact that we solve the inner region energy-independent problem
in order to provide an efficient basis for describing the scattering problem at the boundary, i.e.
equation (2.1). Mathematically, this approach uses a resolution of the identity (i.e. 1 =>; |W) (wl)
and provides a spectral representation of Green’s function to find

Z

where C is the Bloch term, ¥(E) is the scattering-energy-dependent wave function and E is again
the scattering energy. The summation runs over all inner region solutions, i, which is formally
infinite but in practice finite due to the representation of the inner region solutions in a basis set
of size Z. As this equation has the desired solution ¥(E) on both sides, this representation cannot
