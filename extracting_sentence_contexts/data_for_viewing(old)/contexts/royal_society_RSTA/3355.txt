performs a similar expansion, but focuses explicitly on particle trajectories and finds reasonable
agreement with experimentally obtained trajectories. Monismith et al. [48], who consider the
experimental results by several authors, find that Stokes drift is not only cancelled by a Eulerian
current in the depth-integrated sense, but that a cancellation takes place at all levels. Yet, many of
the cases considered include a constant or sheared current even in the absence of waves. Based on
their observations, Monismith et al. [48] hypothesize the existence of (rotational) Gerstner waves
in wave tank experiments, a hypothesis further discussed in Weber [49]. Although the prospect of
Gestner waves is theoretically appealing, resolution of this debate will more probably be found in
careful consideration of the time-varying nature of any mean flow field, noting that even if stable,
the convection solution of Longuet-Higgins [66] will take a very long time to establish, and the
boundary conditions imposed at both ends.

In fact, Paprota et al. [71], who take their measurements after a relatively short wave train of

periodic waves in a relatively long flume, find good agreement with the irrotational theory of : =
Stokes [1], supplemented by a uniform return flow reflecting volume conservation in a closed : S
domain. For waves of intermediate water depth (kh = O(1)) and very large steepness, Grue & : 2
Kolaas [72] find good agreement with nonlinear irrotational theory in the interior of the fluid : &
in a set of very high-quality experiments. Their experiments are stopped long before the first 22
waves reach the end of the flume, but the length of their wave train remains long relative to [4
the water depth. Despite the good agreement with irrotational theory in the interior of the fluid, : =
Grue & Kolaas [72] observe significant additional streaming and associated shear in both the : =
bottom and free surface boundary layers, more than can be predicted by the boundary layer : 2

streaming solution of Longuet-Higgins [66], which the authors note may be invalid due to the
