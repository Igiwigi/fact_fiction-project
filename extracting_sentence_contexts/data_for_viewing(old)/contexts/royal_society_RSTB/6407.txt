ficial (“ sub-blastodermal ”) yolk, resulting in the formation of yolk pyramids—
a phenomenon partly comparable to total cleavage. It is interesting to compare
these yolk pyramids with those occurring in the other Arthropoda. Thus, they
occur in several Myriapods (Hrymons, 1901, Scolopendra ; and others), Crustacea
(REICHENBACH, 1886, both primary and secondary yolk pyramids ; Manton, 1928,
Hemimysis, secondary yolk pyramids; and others), Arachnids (Mortn, 1886,

Theridium ; and others), Pantapoda (Morcan, 1891 ; and others), and finally the
Onychophora (SHELDON, 1888, Peripatus novaezaelandiae). This, and similar evidence,
which need not be marshalled here, point towards the fact, as suggested by STRIND-
BERG, that the secondary yolk cleavage is only a belated expression of true cleavage
activity, and the yolk polyhedra are comparable to true yolk cells. With this view
I am in complete agreement. What share then do these yolk cells, or, in some cases,
yolk syncytia, take in the further development of the embryo? For the majority of
insects the older view of the origin of the mid-gut epithelium from yolk cells is no
longer held. But in Lepisma and Campodea (HEyMons, 1897, a, 6), in Libellulids
(Tscuuprorr, 1903), and in a few other insects the definite origin of the mid-gut
epithelium from yolk cells has been shown. Of special interest is TscHUPROFF’s
observation that in the Libellulidae only the middle part of the mid-gut epithelium
is of yolk cell origin, the rest being ectodermal. This suggests the gradual oblitera-
tion of the yolk cell element from the mid-gut of higher insects. In the majority of
the primitive Pterygota, the yolk cells, after their sudden and belated outburst
