The tendency for increases :3
in the climate response scaling rate is now also visible for the simple Esw and is shown in all :F
experiments. Yet, the behaviour of the far tail is less univocal, with a sharp increase in the rate in : a
the GCM driven experiment, but less pronounced behaviour in the other two experiments. : =

Considering the apparent scaling rates derived from fitting to the scaling curve of the 99.9th : =
percentile (coloured bars at the left of figure 5), it appears that for the low-altitude areas the 13

tail behaviour—a dependency close to 2CC—is predicted rather well for Epgw and Egcm, but
overestimated for the more simple Esw. The latter overestimation is partly due to the fact that
the apparent scaling rate is biased because the experiment has been set up around the most
wet (and therefore humid) months from a 10-year period [31]. But even when taking the more
realistic apparent scaling rates from Epgw (also reanalysis-based but for a longer period), the
climate change response is still lower. We hypothesize that this is related to the stabilization of
the atmosphere.
