Segmentation probably resembles that in Erinaceus and results in an early easily
separated trophoblast, leaving the yolk sac as a complete vesicle. This is followed by
the rapid thickening of the trophoblast on all sides, as indeed at first takes place in
Erinaceus and in man. We should expect therefore an imbedding of the blastocyst
and the formation of a decidua reflexa as in these forms. Of this, however, there is
no sign.

I think there is clearly not such a reflexa formed as in Erinaceus, nor is a
capsularis formed, as in some Rodents, accompanied by obliteration of the uterus
lumen.

On the other hand the facts that the walls of the uterus are of equal thickness all
round, and that there is an equally great sparseness of glandular tissue on all sides,
rather suggest that the embryo does not sink into the mucosa at a very early stage
like Erinaceus, Cavia, etc., but that it remains in the lumen of the uterus and, after
attaining a considerable size and after a great increase of the trophoblast layer has
been effected, it then becomes attached at all points at once to the walls of the
uterus, from which it may have been for a long time separated by the presence of a
thick and persistent zona or albumen layer.

The growth of the blastocyst appears to be accompanied by a great increase in the
interglandular tissue of the stroma ; for the few glands which are to be seen in the
middle region of the swelling are all running parallel to the length of the uterus,
and their openings are evidently at one end or the other of the pregnancy swelling.
