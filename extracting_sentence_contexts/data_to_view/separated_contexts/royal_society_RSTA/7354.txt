It may be mentioned too that in this respect conditions of measurement
were always found to be easier at higher fields, presumably because of the increasing
magneto-resistance effect. The second indirect ‘advantage of working with the smaller
deflexions obtained by reducing the specimen size was the greater homogeneity of field over
the specimen. In fact the inhomogeneity of the field round the centre of the pole-piece
region, although slight, was large enough to cause an appreciable reduction in the amplitude
of the de Haas-van Alphen oscillations for large specimens of metals such as tin where the
period was very small. Although accurate determination of the ‘zero’ position of the light spot was not im-
portant, since the amplitude of the oscillations was the main point of interest, it was
convenient to determine the zero roughly to avoid measuring the deflexions from too
arbitrary a zero (which would have resulted in the final curves of anisotropy against 1/H
being tilted). In this connexion a difficulty arose with metals which became superconducting
at the temperature of measurement, since the small remanent field of the magnet was
sufficient to exert largé couples on the crystal due to its irregular shape.
