Interestingly, most of the research on the impacts of ALAN on
subtidal reefs has been on tropical (e.g. corals and coral reef
fishes) and subtropical (e.g. sea urchins) reef organisms,
whereas many of the studies we have included in this syn-
thesis on ALAN in temperate regions have focused on
intertidal organisms (e.g. barnacles, shellfish and microphy-
tobenthos). Intertidal communities experience very different
environmental conditions than subtidal reef communities,
including likely exposure to higher ALAN intensities; how-
ever, we have had to rely on these studies as research on
the impacts of ALAN in subtidal temperate reefs is still mini-
mal. This difference in research focus between tropical and
temperate marine habitats is potentially owing to the fact
that coral reefs are more likely to be vulnerable to impacts
of light pollution. Water clarity on tropical reefs is typically
much greater than in temperate marine habitats, and thus
light will penetrate deeper through the water column and is
more likely to reach the reef. This difference in light environ-
ments at different latitudes could potentially also result
in a stronger reliance on nocturnal illumination as a cue for
many critical biological events and processes on tropical
reefs, whereas variation in moonlight in higher, temperate,
latitudes may not be as important a cue as the more consider-
able changes in daylength or water temperature, both of
which are more variable in temperate environments. Alterna-
