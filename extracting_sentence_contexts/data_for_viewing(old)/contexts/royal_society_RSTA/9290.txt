deficient. It is not easy to conduct experiments on a short range of one or two
hundred degrees (see later) which is a small portion of the thousands of degrees of
known measured temperatures. So it is necessary to speak with diffidence on this
special branch of the subject of the constitution of the atom.

2. Determinations of the Newtonian constant have hitherto been made at ordinary
temperatures only, special care being taken to maintain uniformity in temperature
throughout the apparatus used; otherwise convection in the air or strains in the
movable system might produce grave errors. This is shown repeatedly in the well-
known researches by Prof. C. V. Boys$ and Prof. J. H. Poynttne.|| The necessity of
providing a steady temperature about the delicate parts of the apparatus has hitherto
been considered an insuperable bar to any direct experiment to discover a temperature
effect for G. In fact, in 1905, shortly before the present research began, the late
Prof. Poyntine and Mr. P. Puriires! wrote as follows :—“ The difficulties of exact
determination (of the Newtonian constant) at ordinary temperatures are not yet
overcome and at very high or low temperatures they would be so much increased
that the research seems at present hopeless.”

3. Yet indirect investigations have been made. Poyntrne and Patiures** counter-
poised a mass of 208 gr. on a balance and varied its temperature between 100° C.
and —186° C. They came to the conclusion that the resulting change in weight,
if any, is less than 1/10° for 1° C. for the range 100° C. to 0° C. and 1/10" for 1° C.,
for the range 0° C. to —186° C.
