noticed, namely, steel, iridium and os-
mium ; but this part of the subject certainly merits farther
investigation, offering a wide and interesting field of research. Some attempts to form other combinations of this description
proved encouraging, but we were prevented, at the time, by
various other avocations, from bestowing on them that atten-

It is a curious fact, that when pure iron is substituted for
steel, the alloys so formed are much less subject to oxidation,
g per cent. of iridium and osmium fused with some pure iron,
gave a button, which when forged and polished was exposed,
with many other pieces, of iron, steel, and. alloys, to a moist
atmosphere/: it was the last of all showing any rust.
