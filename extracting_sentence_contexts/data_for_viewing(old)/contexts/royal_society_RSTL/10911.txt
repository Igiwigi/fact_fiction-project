resistance ab a point.

This is a quantity which we have, and can have no means of measuring except
under circumstances which gecure that is constant for all points over a given surface,
and for all instants over a given time.

It thus appears that there are two essentially distinet viscosities in fluids. The one
a mechanical viscosity arising from the molar motion of the fluid, the other a physical
property of the fluid. It is worth while to point out that, although the conditions
under which the first of these, the mechanical viscosity, can exist depend primarily on
the physical viscosity, the actual magnitudes of these viscosities are independent, or
are only connected in a secondary manner. This is shown by a very sbriking but
little noticed fact. When the motion of the fluid is such that the resistance is as the

square of the velocity, the magnitude of this resistance is sensibly quite independent
of the character of the fluid in all respects except that of density. Thus, when in a
particular pipe the velocity of oil or treacle is sufficient for the resistance to vary as
the square of the velocity, the resistance is practically the same as it would be with
