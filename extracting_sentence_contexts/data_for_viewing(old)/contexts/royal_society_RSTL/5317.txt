SINCE I had the honour of communicating to the Royal Society in June last *, the
results of my investigations on the frequent presence of indigo in human urine, I
have continued to follow up the subject, and this, I trust, with some interesting and
important results.

First. After some difficulty, I have 8ncceeded in obtaining the blue pigment in
question in considerable quantity, 80 as to allow of its being subjected to further
experiment, with the view of furnishing additional proofs of its being really indigo ;
and second, I bave succeeded in determining the cases in which this pigment occurs
most frequently and abundantly, and its probable source.

The present communication comprises these additional particulars and observa-
tions, together with the chief facts connected with the occurrence of indigo in the
urine which have resulted from my previous investigations.

Remarkable cases of variously-coloured urine have been described from time to
time; such instances have, however, hitherto been supposed to be of extremely rare
occurrence, more than a single example of the kind but seldom falling under the
observation of any one individual; they have also been regarded rather as curiosities
and extraordinary anomalies, than as physiological and pathological facts, which, if
rightly understood, are full of the deepest interest and importance.

Although several cases of coloured urine have been described, two only, in which
the colouring matter has been at all satisfactorily proved to be indigo, have been
recorded.
