It is particularly noticeable that we have here to do with
distinct inhibition, the auricle stopping in diastole, and the ventricles tending to do
the same. If now we turn back for a moment to the work on the isolated frog and mammalian
hearts, several points of interest present themselves. An easy calculation shows that
the concentration of venom in the two experiments of Plate VII. was below 1/30,000 ;
in fact, it was about 1/10,000 in the dog, and 1/18,000 in the cat. These calculations
omit to make allowance for the fact that at first, at any rate, the venom could not have
been distributed throughout the entire volume of blood. The strength of solution
must therefore have been greater than the calculation shows.
