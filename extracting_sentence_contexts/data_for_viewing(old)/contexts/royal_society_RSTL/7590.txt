This is the nearest conjecture which has occurred to me.

The parts of the moon's surface to which I have devoted most time are the ri
mountains of Gassendi and Theophilus. The sketches here given of Cyrillus
Catharina (Plate XVI.), are only firs; though not careless drawings, in which
omissions, which I hope at some future time to supply. Rather more progres has
been made with Posidonins, Aristarchns, and Herodotus. I have also begun to skete]
the large and noble gronp which lies to the south of Ptolemzeus, and it is my ea
hope to be able to finish these drawings as well as to complete a good deal of work Â©

In any further attempts of my own to contribute facts toward the survey of the moon
now again taken in hand by the British Association, T shall probably select for carefy
work some particular features, snch as the mountains in the midst of a large crater,
bosses and cup-like hills on the outward Slopes of such a crater, the rents in mountai
ridges, and the low winding banks which appear on the broad grey tracts. But
those who desire to perform a work of high value, and lay a sure foundation for a

tion of eyery element in the great picture of Copernicus, for which we are indebted to.
the Roman Astronomer.

The descriptions which follow relate principally to Gassendi and Theophilus.
