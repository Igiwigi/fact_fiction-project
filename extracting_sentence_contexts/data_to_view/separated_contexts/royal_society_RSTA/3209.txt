For this, we may naively
expand the interaction part of the potential (2.5) in powers of 1? g?/A2 for large A. Then we
may absorb the log A divergence into a renormalization of 4, introducing a renormalization scale
A—k,and end up with

2 1D gg Pg hg? Urls = Fe hitot in SF +O ( E ). (2.6)

This in fact looks like an unstable interaction potential for large ¢ (in obvious contradiction with
(2.5)). This corollary of the original puzzle is resolved by noting that the instability sets in for
large fields where (i?¢7/ A?) ~ O(1), ie. where the large-A expansion is no longer justified. We
emphasize that our line of argument does not rely on the momentum cut-off regularization, but is
identical for gauge-invariant regulators such as propertime or zeta function regularization.
