The rationale for including this is that the second derivation stands valid when we have external
forcing which is not necessarily white-in-time Gaussian. For simplicity, we illustrate it here using
the unforced equation. We formally rewrite du/dt = Q[u] as

t
u6s,8)=uo(s) + [ Qluts, 2dr.
0
In fact, this virtually trivial recasting leads to a non-trivial result. Consider
exp (i0(x) - u(x, t)) = exp {ia : (0 + I, Q[u(x, t)] dr) |
0
=[ex {ioe : (v0 + i. Q[v(x,t)] ar)} exp (ifs T) â€” v(x, t))w(x, ar) D[v]P[w],
0 0

by virtue of (3.3).
