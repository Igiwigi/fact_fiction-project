Migration of other insects

How far the principles suggested here may apply to the long-range migrations of other
insects is a matter for investigation. The object of the following remarks is simply to indicate
that there is nothing in the evidence known to the writer concerning other insect migrants,
which would rule out the extension to them of the general principle of ‘rectification’, and
the consequent distinction between the behavioural and ecological levels of migration
analysis. Apart from the fact that some of the alternative theories criticized here have been
applied to locusts and butterflies alike, there are already indications that the principles
governing butterfly migration may not be as remote from those suggested for locusts as has
been supposed. First, Wiltshire (1946) has pointed out that Lepidoptera migrations, when observed
within their ‘geographical headquarters’, follow a complicated pattern:

‘The general picture is one of travel in many directions under environmental stimuli
and of temporary or permanent settlement wherever the environment permits.’

The over-simplified picture of an emigration followed by a return as the set pattern of
butterfly migration arises, in Wiltshire’s view, from the fact that most observers of Palaearctic
butterflies reside, not in the headquarters region of these species, but at the extreme edge of
that zoogeographical zone. Secondly, the records already assembled by Williams (1949 e¢ ante) show a clear prepon-
derance of migrant butterfly flight directions against or with the wind rather than across it.
“This he dismisses as mere coincidence, or as due to a ‘psychological error’ on the part of
observers.
