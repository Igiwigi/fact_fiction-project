EARTHQUAKE MOTION TO GREAT DISTANCES, 0!

and may rise to over 4:0 kiloms. per second for the long low waves which outrun the
principal ones. The conclusion drawn from the records is greatly strengthened by the fact that, in
the case of the great earthquake of 1897, the only one where the rate of propagation
has been carefully determined within the seismic area as well as at a distance, it
was found that the rate of propagation of the sensible shock, from the origin to
distances up to 15° of are, was practically the same as the rate of propagation of the
waves of the third phase to a distance of 65° of are. The actual difference as
calculated is but 0°1 kilom. per second, or about one-thirtieth of the value, a
difference which is well within the inevitable limits of error of the observations.
