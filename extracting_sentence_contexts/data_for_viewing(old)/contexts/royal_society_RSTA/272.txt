The final section, Macromechanics of Vibrations, comprises three papers. That of McRobie
et al. [77] establishes parallels between the dynamic responses of flexible bridges under the action
of wind and the forces generated by crowd loading. This phenomenon permits application of
conclusions drawn in one field to another. The authors also stress that there are ‘additional
complications of randomness inherent in wind engineering (be it buffeting by incident turbulence
or spanwise decorrelation of vortices’s shed) and the inter- and intra-personal variability inherent
in human walking’. Amabili’s paper [78] notes that ‘reduced-order models are essential to study
nonlinear vibrations of structures and structural components. In fact, large models with many
thousands or more degrees of freedom obtained by commercial finite-element codes cannot
be used to obtain all the branches of the forced vibration response around a resonance of the
structure. This limitation is mainly due to the huge computational problem involved and to the
fact that stiff systems of equations are obtained due to the very different time scales associated
with different degrees of freedom’. The author offers suggestions for selection of the modes to
facilitate reduction of the number of degrees of freedom. In the study by Takacs & Stépan [79],
the authors deal with the delay differential equation for ‘mystical’ low probability large damage
phenomena taking place in shimmy. They calculate the instantaneous lateral tyre deformations in
thin contact patches, using a simple bicycle model of a passenger car.

It is hoped that the readers will enjoy their stroll through this issue.



Michael, many happy returns! May the authors and readers of this issue exhibit fairness,
justice and tolerance to others’ ideas, being aware that good interrelations among us are a major
