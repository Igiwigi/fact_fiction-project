Although the study of the oscillatory part of the anisotropy was the major aim of the
investigation many new measurements were also made, incidentally, of the steady part. The definite theoretical value predicted by the first term of equation (1) is rather mis-
leading, since important contributions to the steady part of the anisotropy may come from
parts of the Fermi surface which contribute only a negligible oscillatory part, and are
therefore ignored in the scheme of ellipsoids deduced from analysis of the oscillatory part. In fact, where a fairly complete scheme of effective masses has been worked out from the
oscillations, the steady anisotropy arising from these masses according to (1) proves to be
usually considerably different from that observed experimentally. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

The first experiments, which were of a preliminary character, were carried out early in
1949 with the apparatus previously used by Mackinnon (1949) in his investigation on zinc,
and in this series the de Haas-van Alphen effect was discovered in gallium, tin and graphite
(Shoenberg 1949). The apparatus, however, was not very flexible in dealing with the neces-
sary variety of conditions and, moreover, the restrictions of field up to 9500 G (which could
be obtained only by overrunning the magnet) and of temperature down to about 1-5Â° K,
imposed several limitations.
