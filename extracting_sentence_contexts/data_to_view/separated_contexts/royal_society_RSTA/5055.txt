This will appear on
igferring to Plate 6, Crewe, and comparing the measurements of the first, second, and
&tird spectra. Although there is some difficulty in obtaining measurements of bands
2 precise as we are accustomed to in line-spectra, this does not account for the
discrepancy. It is, in point of fact, due to the bands altering in width, or, in some
ses, becoming less distinct at the edges ; the bands are also much obscured on some
®ectra by the continuous rays being strong. ‘There is some difficulty also, it may be
fEmarked, in measuring the broad lines visible in some of the banded metallic spectra
