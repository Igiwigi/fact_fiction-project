So far as the systematic separation of
| the two groups is concerned, he is probably perfectly justified in this course ; but it is
interesting to notice that both in Ganoids and Elasmobranchii we have traces of a
wetructure which undergoes a very special development in the Teleostei, and that the
us falciformis of Teleostei is therefore to be regarded, not as an organ peculiar
Zto them, but as the peculiar modification within the group of a primitive Vertebrate
Jorgan.
=o SUCTORIAL DISC.
bh One of the most remarkable organs of the larval Lepidosteus is the suctorial dise,
Splaced at the front end of the head, to which we have made numerous allusions in the
'Sfirst 8ection of this memoir. Z The external features of the dise have been fully dealt with by AGass1z, and he
Balso explained its function by observations on the habits of the larva. We have
Zulready quoted (p. 371) a pasxage from AGass1z' memoir showing how the young
'BFishes use the disc to attach themselves firmly to any convenient object, The discs
appear in fact to be highly efficient organs of attachment, in that the young Fish
Sean remain 8uspended by them to the sides of the jar, even after the water has
Zbeen lowered below the level at which they are attached. EZ The dise is formed two or three days before hatching, and from Acass1z' state-
Ements, it appears bo come into use immediately the young Fish is liberated from the
HSegs membranes.
Â© We have examined the histological structure of the disc at various ages of its growth,
Sand may refer the reader to Plate 21, figs. 11 and 13, and Plate 24, figs. 40 and 44. E The result of our examination has been to show that the disc is provided with a series
A of papillze often exhibiting a bilateral arrangement.
