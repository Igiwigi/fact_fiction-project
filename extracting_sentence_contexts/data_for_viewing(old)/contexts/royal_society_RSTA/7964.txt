it seems likely that its ductility might have reached approximately the same figure.

Copper, however, does not confer its properties on its alloys with iron in the same
way as does nickel, but it is well known that, unlike nickel, it does not form solid
solutions with iron, being practically insoluble beyond about a 4% addition. Copper
can, however, as has been seen, act in partial replacement of nickel in certain ferrous
alloys.

Monel metal and the alloy 3542 may be considered together, both consisting of nickel,
alloyed in the one material with 30% copper and in the other with 18-9% of chromium.
Their properties resemble those of nickel in a modified degree. While the alloy 3542
shows a rather similar increase, 42%, in its tenacity in liquid hydrogen, its ductility is
increased to a greater extent than that of Monel metal, the increase in which is, in fact,
only very slight; that is, from 36 to 38-5% elongation.

These characteristics operating on the initially high tenacity and ductility of the
nickel-chromium alloy 3542, namely, 59-5 tons per square inch with 27-5% elongation,
give it really excellent properties in liquid hydrogen ; that is, a tenacity of no less than
84-1 tons per square inch with an elongation of 34-5%.

In phosphor bronze, specimen 6073A, the additions of tin and zinc have clearly
destroyed the excellent characteristics of copper. Its ductility, instead of markedly
increasing in liquid hydrogen, is very much reduced, and the tenacity shows an increase
of only 30%.
