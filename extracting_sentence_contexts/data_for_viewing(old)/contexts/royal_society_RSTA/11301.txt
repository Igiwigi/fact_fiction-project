to very weak ultra-violet light, do not grow beyond the stage at which a four-fold
supersaturation is required to make condensation take place upon them, grow under
the influence of very strong radiation till they become large enough to scatter
ordinary light.

TYNDALL, many years ago (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ vol. 160, p. 333, 1870), showed that when
the more refrangible rays from an are lamp, such as were able to traverse blue glass but
not red glass, were concentrated within a tube containing air mixed with amyl-nitrite
or certain other vapours, dense clouds were produced. He was unable to obtain any
such effect with pure air and water only. The experiments to be described differ in
no essential respect from his, except in the fact that the rays from the are lamp were
allowed to traverse no material such as glass, which is opaque to the ultra-violet rays,
before entering the tube containing the moist air. Under these conditions, air con-
taining water vapour only, shows the phenomena that were observed by ‘TyNDALL
with other vapours.

I have found the apparatus shown in fig. 5 convenient for experiments on this

subject. It consists of a glass tube 34 centims. long, and 4 centims. in diameter,
provided with a side tube near each end. The ends are closed by quartz lenses,
which are fixed air-tight by means of indiarubber washers. They are pressed tightly
