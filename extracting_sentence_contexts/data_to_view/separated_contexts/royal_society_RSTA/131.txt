Discussion

The wide variety of specific cell signalling problems that involve the binding of surface receptors
(cf. [1-+4,11,12,14,15]) has provided a recent impetus for studying pattern-forming properties
associated with novel classes of RD systems that involve the coupling of a linear RD system
in the interior of a multi-dimensional domain to nonlinear diffusive processes that occur in a
thin strip that protrudes from the domain boundary. In this context, the bulk-membrane system
derived in (2.8) of §2 arises from the asymptotic limit of a vanishing width of this thin strip,
together with a certain scaling law for the membrane-bound species. However, the analysis of
pattern forming properties for this reduced system (2.8) is still rather challenging owing, not only
to the complexity of the geometry, but also to the fact that steady-state solutions are in general
not spatially uniform, even in radially symmetric domains. As a result, this prohibits applying
a standard Turing-type linear stability analysis that has been used so successfully to analyse


pattern formation in more conventional RD systems where spatially uniform steady-states
often occur. For a coupled bulk-membrane RD system on a circular bulk domain, in §3a, we have outlined
the analysis in [21] for the construction of radially symmetric spatially non-uniform steady
states and the derivation of amplitude equations characterizing the weakly nonlinear dynamics
of spatio-temporal patterns near Hopf and pitchfork bifurcation points associated with the
linearization of this non-uniform base state.
