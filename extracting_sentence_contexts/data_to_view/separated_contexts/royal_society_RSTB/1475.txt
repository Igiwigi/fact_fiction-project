As the values are not very consistent, it is not possible to come to very
efinite conclusions as to the effects produced, but it will be seen that, as a rule,
regnation in diluted water exerts a harmful effect, whilst impregnation in con-
sentrated water exerts a beneficial effect upon the subsequent development. The
ean decrease produced by the diluted water is 1°5 per cent., and the mean increase
the concentrated water, 1°6 per cent. As the corrections due to the dilution of
e water of development are so large, it is possible that the apparent effect produced
impregnation in diluted water is only due to experimental error, and does not
ist in fact. In two out of the six observations with concentrated water, a decrease
the size of the larvee was produced, but as both of them were made in the same
ertilisation, viz., that on September 25th, they have not much more weight than a
5 single observation. It may thus be looked upon as highly probable that a favourable
eflect upon the subsequent growth of the larvae is produced by impregnation in con:
trated water.
