The Croontan Lecture, on some Physiological Researches, respect-
ing the Influence of the Brain on the Action of the Heart, and on
the Generation of animal Heat. By Mr. B.C. Brodie, F.R.S.

Read December 20, 1810. Havixs had the honour of being appointed, by the President
of the Royal Society, to give the Croonian Lecture, I trust that
the following facts and observations will be considered as tend-
ing sufficiently to promote the objects, for which the Lecture
was instituted. They appear to throw some light on the mode,
in which the influence of the brain is necessary to the conti-
nuance of the action of the heart; and on the effect, which the
changes produced on the blood in respiration have on the heat
of the animal body. In making experiments on animals to ascertain how far the
influence of the brain is necessary to the action of the heart, I
found that when an animal was pithed by dividing the spinal
marrow in the upper part of the neck, respiration was imme-
diately destroyed, but the heart still continued to contract cir-
culating dark-coloured blood, and that in some instances from
ten to fifteen minutes elapsed before its action had entirely
ceased.
