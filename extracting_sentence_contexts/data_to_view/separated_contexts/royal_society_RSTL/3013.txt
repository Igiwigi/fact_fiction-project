As regards an exhaling power, which I suppose the lungs may possess, I conceive
it may be exercised occasionally under peculiar circumstances—circumstances, in the
first instance, favouring an accumulation of carbonic acid gas in the blood, as undue
pressure of any kind, and, in the second instance, circumstances of a different nature,
connected with the remoyal of undue pressure, admitting thereby the excess to pass

believe, capable of explaining very many particulars of animal temperature in differ-
ent classes of animals, and both during life, in health, and disease, and in a state of
hybernation and after death. If correct, this it must necessarily do, theory being

merely an expression of facts and truths in nature being perfectly consistent,
