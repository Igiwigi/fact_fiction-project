The values given must be taken as superior limits to the actual
particle-size. Now, although an exact discussion is not possible, it is to be expected
that this effect will become less as more colloid is introduced. When 10°, is present,
and the microscope in fact shows only irregular masses with fluctuating extinction,
the phase relation of adjacent crystallites is probably too inexact to reduce the
broadening seriously. Ifwe accept the result for the complex of azide containing 10°,
of dextrine as an approximate measure of the actual size, we find the average width
of the crystallite is more than 20 times that required for all the dextrine to be present
between the surfaces in a single layer. On the other hand, if the crystallites are

smaller than this, and are exactly reinforcing each other’s diffractions, such a degree
of co-ordination can result only from their being parts of larger, branched, parallel
aggregates.
