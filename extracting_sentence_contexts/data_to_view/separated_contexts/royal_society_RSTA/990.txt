Thus, we can clearly distinguish the magnetic
composites (SMA) from the polymer fibres. The particles seem not only randomly embedded
in the polymer network, but also linked by multiple bonds to the alginate chains. This fact
demonstrates the relevant role played by the alginate molecules adsorbed on the particles: both
the alginate molecules in the pre-gel solution and those previously adsorbed on the particles
should be cross-linked to each other by calcium ions. Therefore, the SMA particles are embedded
as knots in a highly entangled network, which will have important effects on the MR response of
the ferrogels, as we will see in §3c. As mentioned in the §1, one of the advantages of using the SM composite particles is their low
average density, as compared with that of pure magnetite, which would hinder their gravitational
