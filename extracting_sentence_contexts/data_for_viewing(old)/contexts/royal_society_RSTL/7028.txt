from a simpler to a higher form.

6. On comparing the condition of the cerebral conyolutions of these brains with the
representations of the brains of two faetuses at about 6} and 7 months, published by
Levrer and GRATIOLETÂ®, it would appear that in both idiots the convolutions are
more complex than in the former, but less 80 than in the latter foetus. From this, one
might hastily suppose that in both idiots the development of the convolutions, and
indeed of the entire cerebra, had been arrested in the latter part of the seyenth month
of intra-uterine life ; those of the idiot boy a little earlier than those of the idiot
woman.

But on further reflection such a supposition does not appear to be tenable, and it is
not supported by facts. It necessarily assumes that, up to a certain period of develop-
ment, the evolution of all the parts of the cerebrum had been normal in rate and in
character ; whereas, in the first place, there is nothing at present to show why that rate
may not, in such cases as these, be more or less retarded, 80 that any given stage is
attained at a much later period than usual, and the ultimate condition of development
be reached perhaps some time after birth ; and, in the second place, there is evidence in
the brains themselves, of such a disproportionate development of parts as to prove that
the normal character of the eyolutional changes has been profoundly disturbed at some
period or other, by at least one local departure from, or interference with the regular
mode and order of development.

A comparison of the size of the cerebellum and cerebrum in the idiots' brains, and in
the brain of a fetus at the seventh month, shows most strikingly that the development of
