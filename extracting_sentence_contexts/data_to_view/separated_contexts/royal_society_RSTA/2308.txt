In the case of Maxwellian molecules, 7.e., molecules which are point. centres of force
varying inversely as the fifth power of the distance, the solution reduces to finite
terms. This arises from the fact (ef. § 9 (C), ‘Phil. Trans.,’ A, vol. 216, p. 323) that
for such a law of inter-action the functions ¢, y, x are independent of y, with the
result that for all values of t we have (ef. (4°25))

(6°01) k,=1, By = Pu, Bia = Bu, Kiog = Ka,
and consequently,
