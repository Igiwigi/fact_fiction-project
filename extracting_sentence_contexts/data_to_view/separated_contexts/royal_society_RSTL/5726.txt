Even in the
mixture of blood and gum many of the corpuscles are cup-shaped, though adhering
together with peculiar tenacity. 8 Whether or not it will ever be possible to explain these curious facts upon chemical
Sprinciples seems very doubtful ; but in the meantime, what appears most striking about
Sthem, and what most concerns the present inquiry, is that great effects may be pro-
Hluced upon the adhesiveness of the red corpuscles, both in the way of increase and
inution, by very slight changes in the chemical qualities of the plasma. 5 The galvanic current produces no effect upon the aggregation of the red corpuscles,
Sither of man or of the frog, as I have ascertained by placing the fine platinum wire
tremities of the poles of a powerful battery a short distance from one another between
two slips of glass beneath the microscope, then completing the circuit by shedding a
op of blood between the plates, and immediately observing the result.
