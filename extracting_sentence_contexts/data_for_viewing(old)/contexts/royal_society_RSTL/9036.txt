A plate of selenium was next used which in outward appearance exactly resembles
the last one, but which has evidently not been s0 well annealed, as its resistance is about
13:1 megohms. The current from the 20 Leclanchs cells was sent through it for a short
and also for a considerable interval of time, but no signs of a polarization-current could
in either case be detected by the galvanometer.

The tubes numbered 3, 4, 8, and 12 were then tested in the same manner, with currents
both of short and long duration from the battery of 20 Leclanchs cells. They all showed
polarization-currents, but only of feeble intensity, the deflection of the galvanometer-
needle yarying from 2 to 7 divisions on the scale. Though small, these currents were,
however, quite distinct.

That all these currents were real polarization-currents was also evident from the fact
that, on lifting any tube out of the commutator and replacing it with its electrodes
reversed in the mercury-cups, the deflection was always on the opposite side of zero to
what it had been previously.

'The next piece used was that in tube No. 15, whose resistance is comparatively small,
being about 0247 of a megohm. The positive pole of the above battery having been
connected with the marked end of the tube, the current was sent through it for five
minutes, and gave rise to a polarization-current of —25, The same current was then
sent through it in the same direction as before for 15 minutes, but at the end of that
time the resulting polarization-current was only —11.

The next day the same tube was tried again, with the following results :—
