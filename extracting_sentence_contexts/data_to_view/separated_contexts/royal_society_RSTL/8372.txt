If in this stage the gonophore be laid open, and the protoplasm masses, whose forma-
tion we have been tracing, be liberated under the microscope, we shall often sueceed
in witnessing very minute bristle-like processes of clear protoplasgm which have become
developed over their surface (fig. 11). 'These little processes, however, are not permanent
structures, and they will often become entirely withdrawn while the object is under
examination. They are, in fact, true pseudopodia, and are probably employed in the
nutrition of the masses from which they arise. 'The contents of the gonophore, however, are intended to undergo further changes
before the period of their liberation has arrived. 'The separate protoplasgm masses
increase in size, the residual matter which had surrounded them disappears, having
probably afforded material for their nutrition ; they begin to coalesce with one another,
and there is ultimately formed a single large plasmodium, which entirely fills the cavity
of the gonophore.
