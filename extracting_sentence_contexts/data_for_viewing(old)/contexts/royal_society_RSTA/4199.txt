By starting with a measurement that accepts no systems, then one state, two states and so on
through increasingly less selective measurements—tecalling that this involves summing over
selective measurement symbols—one sees that the resulting quantities, which can be written in
the form p(a’, b’), are candidates for probabilities. Moreover, one has that p(a’, b’) = p(b’, a’). Noting
that the sum of probabilities is conventionally normalized to 1, one has the natural restriction that
p(a', b') = (b' |a’)(a' | b’) = 0. This condition can be satisfied with (b’ |a’) real, with (b’ |a’) = (a’ |b’),

but this would involve (b’| being interchangeable with |b’), which is in conflict with the difference : 2
in the physical interpretation of the two. Instead, taking (b’|a’) and (a’ |b’) to be complex and : =
taking (b’ | a’) = (a’|b’)* avoids any such conflict (see below). In fact, the matrix formed by the :8
p(a’,b’) can be seen to be doubly stochastic. : 5
