and glucose on hydrolysis, is used, the yield of mannitol is, of course, only half that
produced from pure fructose. This, however, is not the most serious objection to the
use of sucrose ; its worst feature is the production of large quantities of soluble non-
volatile by-products from the glucose part of the sucrose molecule. The main product
arising from glucose, and equal in amount to the yield of mannitol from fructose, is
lactic acid, which, either as the free acid or as the calcium salt, interferes very
seriously with the recovery of mannitol from the fermentation solutions.

(2) Another objection to this method is the difficulty of recovering mannitol from
the fermented liquors. This difficulty arises in part, as described in the last paragraph,
from the production of calcium lactate, but is further intensified by the fact that the
bacteria used for the fermentation require a source of organic nitrogen for growth,
e.g., proteins or peptones. These are not only expensive, and so contribute in part to
the economic objections to this method, but they also add very considerably to the
recovery difficulties.

During the course of investigations on the metabolic products of various common
moulds it has been found here that mannitol is a fairly common product of the
fermentation of glucose by numerous fungi. Since these micro-organisms grow on
very simple media, requiring only inorganic and not organic nitrogen for their nutrition,
and since they produce mannitol either from glucose or fructose, it was felt that the
main objections to the above bacteriological method of producing mannitol might
be overcome by using moulds as the active agents. Actual practice has indeed shown
