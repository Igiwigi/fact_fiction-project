The idea then
is that, if physics is a branch of mathematics, its central axiom should relate to the nature of what
actually physics is. Physics is nothing if it is not the assumption that some structure is ‘out there’
and that one can do an experiment to verify it. An experiment of course involves measuring
or observing something, but actually what is an experimental fact is not something that really
exists in isolation. Any experiment of any complexity usually involves a theory or some abstract
relationship predicted by theory, and from a theorist’s point of view an experiment ‘maps out’ or
confirms the assumed theory. In this sense, an experiment represents a theoretical structure.
