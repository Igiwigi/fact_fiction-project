We cannot in the present case use ¥;! as an abridged notation, because it is infinite
as involving s? — 1 in the denominator,

It is easy to yerify that the other coefficients of @! and $! are, in fact, reproduced
in the transformation. Lastly when s = 0, we have only cosine functions. As before

C = 1 — bBcos 26 — 4? (1 + cos 46) + Bp’,(1 — 48 cos 2) cos 2

E = + Bn’, cos 46
=1 — 158? — 18°p’, + tee ;
