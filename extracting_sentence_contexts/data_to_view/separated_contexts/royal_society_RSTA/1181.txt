An important contribution towards a visualization of unfolded proteins was reported on IDPs
[93-95]. In the work by Miyagi et al., the authors studied facilitates chromatin transcription
protein (FACT), a protein with predicted large ID regions that facilitates RNA polymerase II
transcription and chromatin remodelling [94]. HS-AFM imaging at a remarkable 5-17 frames
per second of immobilized FACT revealed a stable lumpy structure, flanked by long tail-like
structures that underwent rapid fluctuations (figure 4). Analysis of the contour length of the
fluctuating regions and using deletion mutants allowed them to identify the tail structures as
the two major ID regions. Moreover, analysis of the root mean squared point-to-point distance
of the tail-like structures as a function of the contour length provided a measure of the elasticity
of these ID regions by using statistical polymer chain analysis to obtain the persistence length
(Ip).
