N. SALAMAN ON THE POTATO VIRUS “X”:

virus carried by President; when in union with X reproduces a picture similar to that
of ‘Crinkle A’. An example of the second class is the repeatedly observed fact that
whereas paracrinkle virus carried by the King Edward potato produces a severe
crinkle in the variety Arran Victory, if the virus X be added to it the resulting morbid
condition is much reduced in intensity. A further stage of what may be the same
process was obtained when the writer’s potato Streak B (Salaman 1930) associated
with virus X was introduced together with paracrinkle to Arran Victory by means of
grafts which grew vigorously. In this case the following reactions would be expected
from each virus if acting singly:

Paracrinkle on Arran Victory would produce a severe deforming crinkle.
