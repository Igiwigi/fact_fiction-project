The negative pole,
likewise, not only gives an initial impulse to the molecules, but it also continues to act
on them by repulsion, the result being that the molecules move with an accelerating
velocity the further they get from the pole. The lateral divergence of the molecules,
owing to their negative electricity, will naturally increase with the amount of charge
they carry; the greater the number of collisions the more the molecules lose negative
charge, and the less divergent the stream becomes. This hypothesis is borne out by
facts. When the vacuum is just good enough to allow the shadow to be seen, it is
very faint (owing to few molecular rays), but is quite sharp (owing to the divergence
of the molecules laterally). The variation in mutual repulsion is shown by the fact
that the focus projected from a concave pole falls beyond the centre of curyature, and
varies in position with the exhaustion, being longer at high than at low exhaustions.
