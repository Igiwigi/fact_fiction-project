the peculiarity +. However, it has since been proven that the form of this latter excitation
function is due to spin-orbital interaction which is of course negligible for hydrogen. As there
is no doubt that the trend predicted by theory is correct, some effect not taken into account
by Ornstein & Lindeman (such as, perhaps, emission following recombination) must enter.
Allowance should be made for this in assessing the success achieved by the Born approxima-
tion which may be either rather better, or rather worse, than is suggested at present. The
fixing of the scale of the experimental curve by even a single absolute measurement would
obviously be of great value. It is also important to investigate the region near the critical
potential so as to determine whether a type XY peak occurs.

The reliability of the theory may depend on the azimuthal quantum numbers of the con-
nected levels and in particular on whether the transition is optically allowed or forbidden
(cf. § 2-1-3). In this connexion attention may be drawn to the fact that, though the 13
transition is a combination of 128325, 12S—+32P and 12S->32D, the calculated con-
tribution from 12S 3?P is considerably larger than that from the others; for example, at the
maximum it is about 5 times that from 12$—> 325 and about 10 times that from 1 2S—> 32D.
This adds to the significance of the comparison made in figure 2a, since the agreement shown
suggests that the Born approximation yields accurate results for the dominant optically
allowed transition. Such a conclusion must, however, be treated with reserve, as it is contrary
to a general rule indicated by the bulk of the evidence to be presented.

+ Actually though the gradient of the mercury curve diminishes markedly at moderate energies it does
not vanish.
