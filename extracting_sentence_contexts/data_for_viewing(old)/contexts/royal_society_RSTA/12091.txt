4. The question of vaporization of manganese and of manganese oxide from slag is
put beyond all doubt by actual experiment with the oxyhydrogen blowpipe flame.
This explains the fact observed by BRUNNER, namely, that when a converter is being
heated with coke after it has been used, but not re-lined, the spectrum of the Bessemer
flame makes its appearance.

5. The luminosity of the flame during the “ boil” is due, not only to the combustion
of highly-heated carbonic oxide, but also to the presence of the vapours of iron and
manganese in the gas.

6. The disappearance of the manganese spectrum at the end of the “fining stage”
is primarily due to a reduction in the quantity of heated carbonic oxide escaping
from the converter, which arises from the diminished quantity of carbon in the metal.
When the last traces of carbon are gone, so that air may escape through the metal,
the blast instantly oxidizes any manganese either in the metal or in the atmosphere
