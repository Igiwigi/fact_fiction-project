by 3.11 (6), where Z, is a function of 7, »,, z, and_y given by 3.11 (4). Itis always less
than 90°, even though z may exceed 90°; also it exceeds z,, given by sin z, =
rsin z/(r +94).

When k = 1, 3 or 2, the integration in J, can be performed as before (after
substituting for c, and making the usual approximation to /), but only over the
range m= (0 to m= m,; the fact that ¢, is a function of y, and therefore of m,
complicates the corresponding integration over the rest of the range. The first
part of J, is

when & = 1, in which case ¢ = 1/m, ; when k = 2, and c = 1/m,?, it is
F (ac/0,,:, 5, f — 1, 0) — F (ac/0,,., 5, f — 1, m).

The second part of J, can be written
