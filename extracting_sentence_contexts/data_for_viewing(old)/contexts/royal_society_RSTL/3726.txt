could be obtained at the Faulhorn s0 late as the month of September, and for this
purpose I proposed to ascend the Cramont (8966 feet) s00n after the summer solstice,
and I actually did spend a whole day without result on the summit in the month of
July. By making single obseryations throughout the greater part of a day, I pro-
posed to push the experimental Curve XV, further than had yet been done.

I also proposed another experiment which I recommend to future observers. 1
coated the bulb of one actinometer with white paint. The comparative value of the
scale of this and another naked or dark blue bulb, would depend upon the nature of
the incident heat (se Art. 3.). With heat from terrestrial sources transmitted by most
diathermanous bodies, the colour of the surface becomes more and more influential,
as the heat has been drained of its more absorbable part. But it would be very in-
teresting to verify the fact in the case of the solar rays passing through air. For this
purpose I proposed to compare the white and the dark actinometers at the top and
at the bottom of a bigh mountain such as the Cramont, and I expected to find the
disproportion least above and greatest below.
