In passing through the rapids, they were broken into fragments, and, where the
fall was violent, shivered into minute pieces. The larger pieces that remained after
passing through the rapids floated at the surface, immediately as they got into the
uniformly flowing currents at the heads of the pools; but the minuter ones, mixed with
the water to all depths by the plunging whirls in the rapids, not being 80 speedily

for a greater distance immersed in the water, and were intercepted by, and mecha-
nically retained against, the faces of the stones by the action of the stream at the
heads of the pools. Further down, and in tiller water, where no such intercepted
heaps were seen, their buoyancy had, no doubt, by degrees, overcome the cohesion
and raised them to the surface ; and in fact, in the still water, many minute icy frag-
ments were floating in the surface. Mr. Kwicrr, the celebrated botanist, quoted by M.
