CHREE: ANALYSIS OF RESULTS FROM THE KEW MAGNETOGRAPHS

the daily change which we have to account for really amounts on the average of
the eleven years to 0044 + 0016 or 006. Again, the annual inequality is in
general such as to diminish the numerical values found for the non-cyclic effect. In
fact we see from â€˜Tables IV. and V. that the non-cyclic effect is positive in March and
April, the months in which the annual inequality is changing fastest from positive to
negative, while it is negative'in July and August, months in which the annual
inequality is changing from negative to positive. This brings us to another suggestive feature. Four of the five months in which
the mean non-cyclic effect is negative are summer months, while it is positive in six
successive months, November to April, including all the mid-winter months.
