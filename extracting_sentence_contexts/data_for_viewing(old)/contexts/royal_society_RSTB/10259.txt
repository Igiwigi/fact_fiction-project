Perhaps rather than a ‘wildfire problem’ that has
worsened globally in recent decades, the negative, and some-
times tragic, consequences of fire themselves may be gaining
wider public attention and, therefore, recognition. The fact

that nowadays the latest news reports about disasters from ‘The interaction of fire and mankind’ and for inviting us to partici-
around the world are readily available to large parts of the pate. Our fruitful discussions with experts from a wide range of
population may be a contributing factor. What is not spread- fire-related disciplines greatly helped to shape this paper.

ing equally well is the recognition that fire is a fundamental
natural ecological agent in many of our ecosystems and
only a ‘problem’ where we choose to inhabit these fire-
prone regions or we humans introduce it to non-fire-adapted
ecosystems [3]. The ‘wildfire problem’ is essentially more a
social than a natural one.
