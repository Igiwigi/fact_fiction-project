with small spots, while the spots on the preceding six had become larger and darker
in colour. The chief difference now consisted in the appearance of the thorax, which
is of a lighter colour than the rest of the body. The animal may now be regarded
as having acquired all the essential parts of its body. Time and circumstances pre-
vented me from following its transformations still further ; but sufficient, I trust, has
already been observed to claim from naturalists a little more attention to the remark-
able series of phenomena connected with its growth, and to add to the importance
of watching the development of this greatly neglected, but most singular group of
animals.

Recapitulation and Conclusions.

'The conclusions to which the facts detailed in this paper seem to lead, are, I think,
as interesting to the zoologist, in reference to the situation which this remarkable
class, the Myriapoda, ought to occupy in the arrangement of animals, as to the com-
parative anatomist, and physiological inquirer. The evident conformity to one type
of the organs of reproduction in the two sexes, is in accordance with the views now
advocated by the best anatomists. It has been seen that the Inlidz, in some parts of
their organization, as in the organs of reproduction, approach in their internal struc-
ture to the true insect, in maintaining, although in a simple state, a perfect form of
development ; while, in the external parts of the same organs, as in the donble outlets
of the female, and double organs of intromission of the male, they again recede to
the type of those in which these organs exist in one of the lowest forms of deyelop-
ment.
