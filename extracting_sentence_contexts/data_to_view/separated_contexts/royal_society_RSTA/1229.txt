Seismological evidence! indicates a fairly sharp change in the constitution of
the earth at a depth of about 15 km., but there is no independent indication of a change
of properties near the level, 250 km. deep, where the conducting core begins (according
to CHAPMAN’s estimate based on the daily magnetic variations). There may, in fact,
be no sudden inerease of « at this level, but only a gradual increase, and this inerease
may continue to much higher values of « than 3-6.107%. ‘To throw light on this
point we here examine the actual distribution of the induced currents in the core (on

the supposition that it is uniformly conducting and that « = 3-65.10), both for
the daily variations and for magnetic storms. It is found that the currents penetrate
further in the latter case, but that below about 2000 km.
