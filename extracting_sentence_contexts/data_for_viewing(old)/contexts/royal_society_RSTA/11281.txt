but this does not happen to be expressible in a finite integral form for all values of 7,
a fact which necessitates the immediate rejection of the conjecture. The expression
in question is only finite and integral when 7 is of the form 3p or 3p +1. We have,

* Mr, A. B. Kenrt, Treas. R.S., has verified this conclusion by a different and most ingenious method
of summation, which also readily yields the result for any desired restriction on the part-magnitude.

further, the fact that the expression does give the enumeration when 7 = 1, for then
the generating function is easily ascertainable to be

Art. 100. The second of these forms immediately arrests the attention, for, 7
plano, it denotes the number of partitions on a lattice of four points (in fact, a
square), the part-magnitude being limited not to exceed 2. The reason of this is as
follows :—
