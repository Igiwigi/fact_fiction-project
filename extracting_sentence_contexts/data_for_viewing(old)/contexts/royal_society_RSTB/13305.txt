ing produces slightly smaller and more homogeneous
cultures, with higher compatibilities both within and
between agents than any one type of filtering does alone,
when the universal compatibility is negative. For positive
compatibilities, the results are on par with trait filtering,
but with slightly fewer traits in the population.

We have seen that considering systems has consequences for
cultural evolution. With simple filtering tools, even in
domains of mostly incompatible cultural traits, cultural sys-
tems become organized and consistent, without assuming
specific learning biases. In fact, it does not seem to matter
how hostile the traits are to each other (except at the
extremes), the systems reach similar levels of consistency.
What varies is how large the systems can be, and the

organize mostly compatible systems from any universal com-
patibility, they cannot create completely consistent systems. = >
