increased size of the cornea will allow rays of much greater obliquity to be refracted
into the eye, and a spherical lens will diminish the distortion produced by the focus of
â€˜those oblique rays, and that all the more, since the image is received upon a surface
nearly equidistant from the nodal points. In our eye, possessing only a small angle of
acute vision, a blurred image produced at a point near the periphery is of no conse-
quence, but in the case of those animals which have a widely extended sensitive area
and need to see all round them, a sharp focus for peripheral rays is of much greater
importance.

IX. PHystoLocicaL CoNsIDERATIONS.

It is obviously beyond the scope of this paper to attempt any theory of vision or of
colour perception, or even to see to what extent the facts which we have recorded
can be brought into harmony with existing views. It will not be possible to do more
than call attention, and that only in a very cursory manner, to some few among many
points which have specially impressed me in the course of this work.

In referring to a number of our text-books I have been struck with the difference
between the explanation given for the ophthalmoscopic appearance and the descrip-
tions of the eye which underlie the theories of vision. In the first instance we are told
that the ophthalmoscopie image is due to reflection from the choroid and its vessels,
whilst on the other hand we are told that the impinging light is absorbed by the
black opaque epithelial layer of the retina. Now it seems to me that reflections from
the choroid can only be seen if the epithelial layer is transparent, or at least trans-
lucent ; and if this is so, the light is not absorbed by the epithelial layer, but we see
