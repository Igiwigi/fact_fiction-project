Tromson's System of Chemistry (Vol. V. page

offered by that author, which the following experiments will likewise confirm.

application of electricity, from sixty four inch double plates,
a copious coagulation took place at the negative pole. So that water, in which the coagulated white of egg has

quantity of a brown viscid fluid gradually separates from it,
