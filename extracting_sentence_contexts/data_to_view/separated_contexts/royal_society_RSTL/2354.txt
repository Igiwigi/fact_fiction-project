Con
ſiderable irregularities occurred in trying the above ex=
periments, and indeed all thoſe with a chain; for it fre
quently happened, that the ſhock would not paſs with
the battery charged to a certain degree, when perhaps
minute after, it would paſs with not more than threes
fourths of the charge. The irregularity, however, wa
not ſo great but that, Ithink, Imay be certain of the trutl
of the foregoing facts; eſpecially as the experiments wert
repeated ſeveral times. The uncertainty was at leaſt a
great in the experiments with LaNE's electrometer, whe
the knobs were brought ſo cloſe together, as is necefſ?
in experiments of this kind. It appears therefore, that if the whole battery, and
fingle row of it, are both charged in ſuch a degree as 0
give a ſhock of the ſame ſtrength, the ſhock with th
whole battery will paſs through fewer loops of the chai
than that with the ſingle row; ſo that, I think, there cz
be no doubt, but that if the battery had been larg
enough, I ſhould have been able to give a ſhock of th
uſual ftrength, which yet would not have paſſed throug
a ſingle interval of the links of a chain, ;

On the whole, I think, there ſeems nothing in th
phenomena of the torpedo at all incompatible with: elec
