In 1876, at the time of the Hellgate explosions at the entrance to the New York
Harbour, experiments were arranged by General ABBorT for like determinations. These experiments gave velocities varying between 3,000 and 8,300 feet per second. By a different eeries of experiments on the * compressibility of solid cubes” of rock,
Mr. MAarrzr determined *the mean modulus of elasticity of the material,” and inferred
the fact that owing to discontinuity of rocky masses as found in nature, nearly $ of
the full velocity is lost.” (See *The Eruption of Vesnvius in 1872,” by Professor
Luxor Parr, with notes by Roperr MALLET, p. 18.) These determinations of velocity of wave transit are, s0 far as we are aware, all that
has yet been done in the experimental investigation of phenomena connected with the
transmission of vibratory motion through the earth's crust.
