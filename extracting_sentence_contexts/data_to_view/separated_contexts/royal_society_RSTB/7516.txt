The internal carotid artery

The remains of an internal carotid artery was found in dissected preparations as a fine
strand of fibrous tissue, extending from the common carotid artery to the tympanic bulla. In no specimen, however, could the patency of the vessel be demonstrated by the use of
an injection mass. This may be due to the fact that the youngest cat examined was about
1 month old. The ascending pharyngeal artery

This artery generally arises from the occipital artery near its origin from the external
carotid artery. After passing over the inferior surface of the tympanic bulla, it enters the
cranium through the foramen lacerum medium (foramen lacerum of man) and courses
through the cavernous sinus to join the arteria anastomotica at the point where this passes
through the dura (figures 1, 15).
