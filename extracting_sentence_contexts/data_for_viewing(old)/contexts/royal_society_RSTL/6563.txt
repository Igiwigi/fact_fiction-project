The calculation of the ten divisions of this determinant would however itself haye been a
work of some labour.

The last-mentioned determinant is =y*; in fact, equating it to zero, we have the
transformed equation corresponding to the system of equations

(151;4; 1:35 Lew, S090;
4=(7+1)B+(a*+5x+4)C+(2*+54*+107+6)D+(4*+54a%+104a*+107+4)E.
But the first of these equations is (x+1)*=0, and the second is
y=(a+1)(B+(a+4)C+(a*+4x+6)D+(a%+42%+62+4)E},

£0 that for each of the five equal roots z=—1, we have y=0, or the transformed
equation in y is y*=0.
