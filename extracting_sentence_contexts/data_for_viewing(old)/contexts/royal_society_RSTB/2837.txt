THE MORPHOLOGY OF SPORE-PRODUCING MEMBERS. 195

certain Thallophytes, the sporophyte as it is seen in the Archegoniatz may have
originated, as a matter of adaptation to life on dry land.*

But against this hypothesis, and apparently supporting the position of those who
uphold PrinesHern’s view of homologous alternation, is another line of evidence, which
has since 1893 been strengthened by striking new facts, viz., the discovery of fresh
cases of direct vegetative transition from the one generation to the other in
Archegoniate plants.t Apogamy and apospory are both phenomena of more frequent
occurrence, especially in Ferns, than had previously been anticipated, and many of
the examples of it seem to obliterate any limits between the two generations. But
though the upholders of the antithetic theory would hold the two generations to be
distinct as regards origin, it is not essential for that theory that the distinction should
always be maintained in individuals now living. These vegetative transitions,
appearing as they do most frequently in plants which are highly specialised, such as
the Leptosporangiate Ferns, or under the stress of special circumstances, do not
appear to be incompatible with the antithetic theory as above sketched, for it seems
probable that they were not of primary origin, but acquired more recently, as short
cuts in the life-cycle ; this suggestion accords well with the facts.
