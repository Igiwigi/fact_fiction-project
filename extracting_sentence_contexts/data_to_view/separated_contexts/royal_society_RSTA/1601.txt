(a) Estimates of the solutions

This subsection is devoted to recalling some technical results concerning the behaviour of the
periodic solutions of a delay differential equation

=u" (t) =h(t, u(t), u(t — 2), u'(b) (2.1)

which is slightly different from (1.5) in the sense that h is defined in R*. On the other hand,
h is, as f, L'-Carathéodory and T-periodic with respect to the first variable. The importance
of the results of this subsection lies in the fact that they help to establish various a priori bounds
for the solutions of problem (1.5), as will be clear in §3. The next two results are special versions
of the maximum principle and are essentially proven in [2, Lemma 6.1]. We give the easy proofs
for the sake of completeness.
