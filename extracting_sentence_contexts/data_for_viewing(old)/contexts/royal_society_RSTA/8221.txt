we may get some information.

280 EARL OF BERKELEY AND EB. STENHOUSE; DENSITY OF VAPOURS IN EQUILIBRIUM

For the same substance at the same temperature we have the following three sets of
experiments (10), (11) and (12), where clearly the faster air current carries away less
vapour from the second vessel.

(8) and (18) also follow the rule, but the figures are somewhat complicated by the
fact that in (13) the water was in vessel 4, but we may assume that if the water had been
in 2, the loss would have been 0018 x 1-6 = 0029.

(2) and (3) also follow the rule.

For different substances at the same temperature, we can compare (1) and (2). Here we
have to bring (2) to the loss that would have occurred had the EtOH been in vessel 2,
while (1) must be corrected in the ratio of the vapour pressures ; the numbers are (1)
losses 0-0015  29+7/12-8 = 0035, and (2) 0041 x 1-6 = 0066, these numbers follow
the rule.

But if we compare (4) and (5) ; (6) and (7); and (8) and (10) the rule is not followed.
An explanation of this is not far to seek, for on referring to the appropriate tables it
