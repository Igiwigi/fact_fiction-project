Similarly, Israeli & (e.g. altered swimming speed [86]). These findings highlight
Kimmel [87] found that hypoxia mainly increased horizontal the importance of determining the time course of oxygen
dimensions, while the school depth remained constant in level changes in the wild. In fact, if hypoxia is induced by
Carassius auratus. It is therefore possible that the first response plant and algal oxygen consumption, the temporal change in
of schools to hypoxia is to increase the horizontal spacing the DO may be of the order of hours [15] with no clear
between fish. This would allow fish to increase the indi- change in the schooling behaviour.
