formed to cubic cones having a fixed vertex P and passing through the rational normal
quartic curve cy. 1t is easily seen that any one of these cubic cones contains two trisecant
planes of c,, and, beside the six chords of c, which lie in these, ten other chords of ¢,.
For on projection from P the cone projects into a cubic surface containing the projection
of cy, say ¢,’ ; and it is a simple matter to show from the plane representation of the cubic
surface that two lines of the latter are trisecant of c,’ and ten of them are chords. Now
the ten chords of ¢, which lie on one of the cubic cones in question, K, say,are exceptional
lines in § and correspond in fact to nodes of the cubic primal V,* to which Ky corre-
sponds.* For if to one of the chords 1, the corresponding point of V,3 be L,, then to
any line 4 through L, there corresponds a ®-curve breaking up into the line /, together
with a rational cubic curve c; meeting /, in one point, c, in four, and passing through P.
This curve c,; meets K, in nine points of which four lie on ¢,, one lies on /,, and three lie
at P, so that only one is free. Hence the arbitrary line 4 through L, meets V,* in only
one variable point, i.e., L, is a node of V,°. Hence all cubic primals through « projected
Veronese surface are Segre 10-nodal cubics ;+ there are «%°® of them.

The above transformation {2, 4, 4} can be immediately derived from a symmetrical quadric-
quadric transformation of one [5] 8; into a second [5] Xs in which each of the two H-systems
of quadrics consists of all the quadrics through a Veronese surface. Any prime § of S;
corresponds to a quadric 2 of X, ; and if we project Q from a point of itself into a [4]
