Concluding Remarks. The main purpose of this paper is to make some additions to our knowledge of the
remains from Gasp√© which Dawson included under the name Psilophyton princeps. The facts ascertained from the specimens available for study suggest the need of more
detailed examination of other small-leaved Early Devonian plants. Any full discussion
of the questions on which the new data bear would be premature until the corresponding
features of these other remains have been ascertained. All that can be done at present
is to comment briefly on the directions in which some of the observations recorded here
seem to point.
