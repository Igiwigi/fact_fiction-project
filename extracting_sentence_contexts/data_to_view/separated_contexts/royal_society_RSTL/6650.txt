PUGH ON

It will be remembered that, under equal cireumstances of 80il and season,
crops yield two, three, or more times as much Nitrogen per acre as Graminaceous
Yet, whilst the latter are very characteristically benefited by the use of direct
genous manures, the former, yielding 80 much more Nitrogen, are not 80. Again, t
Graminaceous crop, requiring for full produce snch direct supply of available Ni \!
within the s0il, is very much increased, beyond what it would be if it 8ueceeded a crop j
of the same description, when it follows a Leguminous crop, in which has been F
off 80 much Nitrogen. ,
Experiments such as those now specially under. consideration can obviously bear
upon a few only of the cireumstances with which may be connected the causes of this
aifference between the Graminaceous and the Leguminous crops. Without, therefore,
pretending adequately to discuss this wide subject, we will consider it only s0 far as our
facts appear to bear upon it; they seem to limit us to the consideration of
f

immediate
the following cases :—

1. The difference may be due to the decomposition of nitrogenous compounds during
the growth of the Graminaceous plants, and to the evolution of free Nitrogen. b

2. The Leguminous plants may assimilate the free Nitrogen of the air, and thus, not,
only allow the resources of the s0il to accumulate, but also leave within it an additional
quantity, in roots and other vegetable d6bris, from that which has been assimilated, as
above supposed.
