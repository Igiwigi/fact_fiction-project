The
Vpp is much smaller than its intracellular counterpart, and therefore it is magnified in the figure. Approximately, both passive and active sensors achieve ~ 6 Vpp with Ryjseal = 900 M2, and
1 1 Vpp or less with Ryjseal = 100 M@. While these numbers depend on the chosen parameter
values and can be improved to some extent by changing the sensor geometry and coupling to
the neuron, the observed trends are consistent with expectations because of the screening of the
double layers at the cleftâ€™s interfaces in the intrinsic part of the device next to the protrusions and
because of the fact that Rjseai is directly connected to ground. With the goal in mind to investigate the time and frequency responses of the four case-study
systems of figure 6 for various neuron-sensor coupling conditions, figure 8 shows the modulus
of the transfer functions (TFs) |7(f)| = |Vout(f)/Vn(f)| for the circuits in figure 4 and two Rpjseal
values over an extended frequency range suited to identify some relevant features. Qualitatively
speaking, the TFs confirm that in the frequency range of the AP spectra, a flat gain can be achieved
in intracellular sensing conditions, whereas for extracellular sensing the TFs are dominated by low
frequency zeros.
