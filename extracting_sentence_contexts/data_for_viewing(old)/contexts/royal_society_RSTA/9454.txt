is excess of iron. During heating the reverse changes take place. The eutectoid
transforms first and then the iron or the carbide as the case may be.

Qualitative evidence of these statements is provided by the microscope, and the
theory which accounts for them gives rise to the so-called equilibrium diagram based
upon thermal observations during cooling. It occurred to us that the thermomagnetic
method might throw some useful light upon that part of the equilibrium diagram
which relates to the appearance and disappearance of the eutectoid. This opinion
was based upon the fact that, for reasons which need not be dwelt upon, when the
eutectoid or any portion of it disappears during heating the iron in it should lose
practically all its magnetism. Conversely, when the reverse change takes place during
cooling, that magnetism should be regained.

2. Materials Used and Methods of Measurement.

Most of the specimens of steel examined were cut from materials, described in
earlier papers,* which were given to us by Mr. E. A. Wratcut and by Prof. J. O.
Arnotp, F.R.S., respectively. The analyses supplied, showing percentages of
elements other than iron, were as below :â€”
