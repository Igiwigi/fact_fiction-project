SOUFRIERE, AND ON A VISIT TO MONTAGNE PELEE, IN 1902. 455

Mr. T. M. McDonaup, who knows every feature of this coast intimately, pointed
out to us that in most cases they had disappeared with the houses which were
planted on them. The rocky cliffs behind them still stand, bearing the remains of
the trees which previously grew there. Only the wedged-shaped deltas have
yanished. There is no trace of any fracture or dislocation, and the marks cut by the
tide on this shore show that there has been no change of level, or, at any rate, none
of more than a few inches. Everything points to the slipping of loose, gravelly and
sandy deposits piled on the steep submarine slope which characterises this coast.

There is no difficulty in believing that a similar process has gone on at Wallibu and
Morne Ronde, and this will explain most of the facts observed. Mr. Roprrrson, of
Wallibu, left for Chateaubelair on Wednesday, the 7th May, about 12.30 pm. As
he went down from his house to the boat on the sea shore he noticed that the flat
beach was sinking, “ dropping down like stuff from a cart,” and the bluff behind was
tumbling down on the flat below. The impression formed on his mind was that the
soft, incoherent accumulations were settling down under the concussions and earth-
quakes produced by the eruptions, No one saw this part of the shore again till
several days had elapsed, and then it was in essentially the same condition as when
we visited it, except that there was no beach below the cliff.

Allowance must also be made for the effects of the blast which rushed out from the
valleys of the Wallibu and Wallibu Dry Rivers. It was strong enough to blow down
many of the trees on the ridge above Wallibu, and must have raised the sea in
