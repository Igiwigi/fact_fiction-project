For this reason I decided to construct a rough apparatus in which the two cylinders
could be rotated separately. The experiments performed with this apparatus are
described in a preliminary paper.* The results appeared to show that the criterion
O.R,? > Q,R? is approximately satisfied in a viscous fluid, but that Ray ercu’s
result is not true for the case when the two cylinders are rotating in opposite directions.
The experiments also indicated that the type of disturbance which is formed when
instability occurs is symmetrical. These results encouraged me to embark on the
complicated problem of trying to calculate the possible symmetrical disturbances of a
viscous liquid contained between two rotating cylinders, and at the same time I started
to construct an apparatus for observing as accurately as possible the conditions under
which instability arises,

The complexity of the mathematical problem arises from the fact that it is necessary
to obtain a three-dimensional solution of the equations of motion in which all three
components of velocity vanish at both the cylindrical boundaries.

Stability for Symmetrical Disturbances.

Before proceeding to the details of the solution of the problem it may be helpful to
readers to give a list of the symbols employed. In Table I. the number of the page on
which each symbol is defined is given,
