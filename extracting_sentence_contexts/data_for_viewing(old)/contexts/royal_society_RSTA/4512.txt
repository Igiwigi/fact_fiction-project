accurate empirical reconstruction of the underlying phase space, even in the presence of weak
(observational and dynamic) noise [15]. Furthermore, the ordinal patterns associated with the
PDF are invariant with respect to nonlinear monotonic transformations. Accordingly, nonlinear
drifts or scaling artificially introduced by a measurement device will not modify the estimation of
quantifiers, a nice property if one deals with experimental data (e.g. [41]). These advantages make
the BP methodology more convenient than conventional methods based on range partitioning (i.e.
PDF based on histograms).

Additional advantages of the method reside in (i) its simplicity, as we need few parameters,
the pattern length/embedding dimension D and the embedding delay t, and (ii) the extremely
fast nature of the pertinent calculation process [42]. The BP methodology can be applied not
only to time series representative of low dimensional dynamical systems, but also to any type
of time series (regular, chaotic, noisy or reality based). In fact, the existence of an attractor in the
D-dimensional phase space is not assumed. The only condition for the applicability of the BP
methodology is a very weak stationary assumption (that is, for k < D, the probability for x; < x}4
should not depend on t [15]).

To use the Bandt & Pompe [15] methodology for evaluating the PDF, P, associated with the
time series (dynamical system) under study, one starts by considering partitions of the pertinent
D-dimensional space that will hopefully ‘reveal’ relevant details of the ordinal structure of
a given one-dimensional time series X(t) = {x1;t=1,...,M} with embedding dimension D > 1
(D €N) and embedding time delay t (t € N). We are interested in ‘ordinal patterns’ of order
(length) D generated by (s)+> (%s_(p~1)r/ Xs—(D—2)r/+++/Xs—1/Xs), Which assigns to each time s
the D-dimensional vector of values at times s,s —t,...,s —(D—1)t. Clearly, the greater the
D value, the more information on the past is incorporated into our vectors. By ‘ordinal pattern’
