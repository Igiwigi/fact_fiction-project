} A preliminary investigation of the detailed physical processes that occur during the sliding of
rigidly-held lubricated metallic surfaces has recently been carried out using a cathode ray oscillograph. In the presence of a mineral oil very rapid and violent fluctuations in both the surface temperature and
the contact resistance were observed, often in periods of less than 1/30,000 sec.; with oleic acid some
fluctuations again occurred, but to a less marked extent. These are, in fact, the results that would be
expected if the motion were smoother with oleic acid than with the mineral oil.

practice has been fully discussed elsewhere (Bowden et al. 19394). It was shown that
any minute stick-slips that take place during sliding may set up vibrations in the
moving parts. The amplitude and frequency of these vibrations will depend on the
mechanical properties and the restraints of the moving parts.
