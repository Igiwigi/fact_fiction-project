These, relations of walls and septa are characteristic of Astreine, Fungine,
Lophoserinz, and Eupsamminz, and are absent in the Turbinolids, Madreporid
(excl, Eupsamminze) and Poritines.

The Lophoserinze more especially resemble the Eupsammine in respect of the non-
continuity of the successive growth-parts in the septal trabeculae. The irregular pores
in the septa are thus explained in both Lophoserinz and Eupsamminz.

The nodulate shape of the individual trabecular growth-parts in the Eupsamminz
closely resembles that characteristic of Pseudoastrwine, of Siderastrwa, and of
Lophoserine. In all these types, as well as in Fungia, the coalescence of septal ends
with one another is frequent, and is associated with the general fact that the basal
body-wall in this group forms small invaginations at any part of the interradial
loculi,

As a rule, the branching colonies of Eupsammids tend to the simpler form
of canalicular system observed in Funginse and Lophoserinw, and have not the
complicated coenenchyme of Turbinaria, Madrepora, and Porites.

Reeapitulating briefly the most important features of Hupsammia, we have -â€”

(1.) The trabeculee composing the septum often incompletely united with one
another, as in Pseudoastraine, Fungia, Lophoseris, &c,
