Thus we now speak of sternbergian piths and diploxyloid
stems. $0 the term amyeloid conveniently designates these pithless roots of the Coal-measures,


OF THE FOSSIL PLANTS OF THE COAL-MEASURES. 73

I have already referred to the fact that the ligneous reticulations are deposited on the
inner surfaces of the walls of the vessels of Aserophylites, and that these deposits are
more distinct on those sides that are in contact with the medullary rays than on those
which are tangential to the circumference of the stem. In the axis of the root this
difference becomes yet greater, since on the tangential surfaces the reticulations dis-
appear altogether. When we remember that precisely similar conditions exist in the
distribution of the circular disks on the corresponding portions of the fibres of Coni-
ferous stems, we may suspect that some similar influence regulates that distribution in
both cases.
