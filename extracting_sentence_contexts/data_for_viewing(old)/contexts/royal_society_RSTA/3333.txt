It may be noted that if measurements at the flat bed are available, then bounds based on
pressure measurements become sharper than those based on velocity measurements, while
velocity measurements should be used to arrive at sharper bounds when measurements are taken
closer to the free surface.

(3.27)


Another interesting point to note, as was also observed in [14], is that, when k = c, the bounds in
equations (3.22)-(3.24) and equations (3.26)-(3.27) all lead to a Stokes wave of trivial amplitude.
This is equivalent to the fact that a Stokes wave of the same speed as an underlying uniform
current can only coexist if the top surface is flat. Hence, the case k =c needs no further perusal.

4. Estimates on wave heights: k < ¢

To deal with this case, let us define ¢ = c — k > 0. The case can be treated in a similar way as in [12]
with a wave speed of ¢ and no current. However, we need to make appropriate modifications
to account for measurements at an arbitrary depth. We proceed to obtain the bounds on wave
heights.

The case with k <c results in flow fields (see [14] for details) similar to the flow fields when
there is no underlying current (e.g. see [21-24]). The results are summarized as follows.
