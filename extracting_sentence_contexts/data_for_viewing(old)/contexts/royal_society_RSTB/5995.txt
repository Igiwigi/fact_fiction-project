It may be argued, however, that while there is high pressure behind the limbs as

a result of their backward beat, the pressure in the median space due to their opposing

gnathobases pressing on each other is still g

they do come together during their backstro.
studying a living Daphnia on its back, or, better still, a living Simocephalus which
naturally feeds on its back. I have observed both, and found that while the limbs
to a slight degree during their backwards and forwards movements
their edges never touch. ‘This is evident from the fact that it is possible to observe
the floor of the food groove accurately throughout the limb movement. If the limbs
touched at any time during their motion this would cut off the view of the food groove,
and with limbs moving with such a low frequency as those of Daphnia, an interruption
of this sort would completely obscure the food groove. Not only can the food groove
be seen, but the tips of the moving filter combs can be watched.

If the limbs moved with very high frequency such as do those of Diaptomus, it would
be possible to see through them, though the view obtained would not be clear, but with
limbs moving with the frequency of those of Daphnia the “ flicker ” produced is sufficient
to obscure all details underlying them.

It is difficult to understand how SrorcH came to his conclusions, because he most
