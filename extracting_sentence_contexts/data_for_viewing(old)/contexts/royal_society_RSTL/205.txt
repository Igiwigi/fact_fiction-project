Admitting the accuracy of these experiments, and I think

that they will be found correct when repeated, what are their
consequences in a theoretical point of view ?

They are evidently in direct opposition to Dr. Cxawrony's
hypothesis ; the essence of which is, that the capacity of ar-
terial blood for heat is greater than that of venous, that there
is no difference of temperature between the two ventricles of
the heart, and in fact that the heat of all parts is nearly the
Same.

They are more agreeable to, and indeed they even support
the hypothesis of Dr. BLack, that animal heat is produced in
the lungs, and distributed over the whole system by means of
the arterial blood.

Neither are they inconsistent with that hypothesis which
considers the production of animal heat as dependent on the
energy of the nervous system, and arising from all the vital
actions constantly occurring.
