REPRODUCTION IN THE COMMON SHREW 28

It was known that several of these animals were non-parous and it follows that
transference is therefore not confined to parous animals. Transference must take
place before implantation and the fact that it has done so in at least 10 of the 28
available examples with pre-implantation stages in the uterus indicates that it takes
place fairly soon after the ova reach the uterus. It does not take place immediately,
however, since in the earliest uterine stages the blastocysts are always grouped
together in the uterus in the vicinity of the opening of the Fallopian tube. The
blastocysts are about 125% in diameter when they reach the uterus from the
Fallopian tube and those of the earliest stage in which transference has been found
are 170 » in diameter approximately.

During the months of June to November 11 parous females were obtained which
were lactating but not pregnant. No corpora lutea were present and the largest
