VERTEBRAL CENTRA IN SHARKS AND RAYS. 355

in sections of vertebree of the adult fish (fig. 8, A, ee), although the portions
actually at the extremity of the diagonal lamelle are missing. In one vertebra,
however, the outward rate of calcification of the diagonal lamella exceeded, as it
were, the rate of outward bulging of the sheath-cartilage, and the end-portion of the
membrane became caught or entangled in the lamella, as is shown in the right upper
quadrant of fig. 8, A. All four quadrants of the vertebra in question showed the
phenomenon ; the next vertebra to it exhibited the usual relations; in order to
avoid the necessity of a separate figure, the exceptional relations are here illustrated
in one of the quadrants of a vertebra which was in point of fact normal throughout.
The exceptional condition is of interest in showing the disregard exhibited by a
growing calcification for the mode of origin of the cartilage in which it is proceeding ;
it is immaterial that the calcification, begun in outer-zone cartilage, should be
confined to that cartilage ; it may proceed unchecked into the arch-cartilage external
to the limiting membrane. Another instance of such disregard of the origin of the
cartilage is given in the case of Pliotrema (p. 375).

In the adults of Carcharias and Sphyrna the lateral intermedialia are very obtuse,
the base of the wedge being large and the radial extent relatively small. The
calcification is usually compact in the former genus, but in Sphyrna there are radial
rod-shaped tracts of uncalcified cartilage in the intermedialia (fig. 8, B), with blood-
vessels penetrating into them. Similar tracts of uncalcified cartilage are shown in
