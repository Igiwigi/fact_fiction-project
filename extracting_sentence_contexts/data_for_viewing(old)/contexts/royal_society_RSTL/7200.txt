into the sea, which all gets into the equatorial current, and moves to the westward. It
is evident that this warm water must increase its relative quantity of salt by eyaporation
during its motion across the Atlantic, and a comparison of the analyses of the single
samples of the water from the equatorial current shows that this effect really takes
place. The easternmost sample contains the minimum, with 34'238 per 1000, and the
two westernmost- samples contain the greatest quantity of salt, with 36-084. Thus the
equatorial current appears as a continuation of the large West African rivers of the
equatorial zone, which dilute the sea-water of the equatorial region with about 8 per
cent. of fresh water, and thus counteract the great evaporation. While the equatorial
current, continues its course along the north-east coast of South America, it receives and
carries with it the waters of the Paranahyba, the Araguai, the Amazon river, the Ese-
quibo, the Orinoco, and numerous smaller rivers of the north coast of South America ;
but though I have no observations from this part of the current *, the fact is 8hown by
three observations from the sea in the neighbourhood of the Danish islands of St. Croix

* [When my remarks on the equatorial current between Cape Roque and the West Indian islands were
written, T was not aware of the very interesting observations which General Sapixe made in 1822, on the
influence of the water of the Amazon river on that of the Equatorial current. IT shall now insert them here,
their bearing being in the same way as my deficient obseryations.

In 5? 8' N. lat. and 50? 28' W. long. a distinct line of separation was obseryed between the pure blue water
of the ocean and the discoloured water mixed with that from the Amazon river, the mouth of which was about
300 miles distant. The blue water had a specific gravity of 1:0262, which according to my calculation (p. 37)
is =33-672 per 1000 salt, while the water on the other side of the line of separation was 1:0204=26:345 per
1000 alt; further on, under the influence of the river, it was 1:0185=23-800 per 1000 salt. But the river
