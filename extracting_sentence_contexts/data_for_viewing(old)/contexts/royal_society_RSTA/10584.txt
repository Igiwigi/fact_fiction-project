182 MR. J. H. JEANS ON THE VIBRATIONS AND

Evidence from the Distribution of Earthquake Centres.

§ 38. It can be seen that the earthquake regions of the world have a reference, as
regards their distribution on the earth’s surface, to this pear-shaped figure, and this,
again, must be considered as evidence.

Let us first examine the facts. Minne divides the earthquake-areas of the globe
into twelve distinct regions, and a map of these is given in the ‘ British Association
Report’ for 1902.* These regions are given in the following table. The first figure
denotes the number of large earthquakes which have occurred in these regions in the
three years 1899-1901. The earthquakes from the three regions printed in italics
were small in comparison with the others. In the last column is given the
approximate latitude of the centre of each region, referred to Greenwich as pole (the
latitude of Greenwich being taken to be + 90°).
