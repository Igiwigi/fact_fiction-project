OWEN ON THE GENERATION OF THE MARSUPIAL ANIMALS, 347

Mr. Morcax tried a similar experiment with a mammary foetus about the size of
a Norway Rat, which after two hours' separation from the nipple regained its hold,
and sustained no injury from the interruption of the supply of nourisghment. The
evidence, therefore, which has been adduced establishes the fact that the mammary
foetus at a very early period is at least capable of sustaining a separation from the
nipple; and although it may not at this stage of growth possess the power of regain-
ing its hold by its own unaided efforts, it is far from being the inert and formless
embryo which it has been described to be: it resembles, on the contrary, in its vital
powers, the new-born young of the smaller Mammalia rather than the uterine foetus
of a larger species when at a period of development at which this corresponds in size
to a new-born Kangaroo. By comparing the new-born Kangaroo with such a foetus, we find that although
in the Kangaroo the ordinary laws of development have been adhered to in the more
advanced condition of the anterior part of the body and corresponding extremities,
yet that the brain does not present s0 disproportionate a $ize; and the same differ-
ence is observable in the uterine foetus of the Kangaroo (Plate VII. fig. 3.), even
when compared with the same-sized embryo of an animal of an inferior class
(Plate VII. fig. 4.). This difference, I apprehend, is owing to the rapidity with which
the heart and lungs acquire their adult structure in the Kangaroo, whereby the
passage of the purer and more nutritious blood through the foramen ovale and left
auricle to the primary branches of the aorta is arrested.
