although they completely

develop; but we have not found this to be the case. Rather a, owes its smaller
size to its slower growth. Finally, the ossicles in the oral angles are ventral to the
nerve trunks. These ossicles of Amphiura squamata are, as ZUR STRASSEN points
out, represented in other forms by similarly placed but more substantial ossicles. We
have observed them in microscopic sections of Ophioglypha lepida as hoop-like ossicles
embracing the tentacles, articulating below with the under arm-plate of the second
segment, above with ad,, and we find that a precisely similar pair of ossicles is present
in the Liassic species Ophioderma egertoni. There can be little doubt that they are
“etwas neu erworbenes,” as ZUR STRASSEN says, of the peristomial plates, and possibly
they are the equivalent of an under arm-plate, the fact that they are double being
due to their position. It should be pointed out that Lupwie figures an under
arm-plate in the vertical wall of the oral angle (9, Plate 3, fig. 1). Sometimes each
of these little hoop-like plates is divided by a transverse suture. But too much value
must not be attached to sutures, for they may be secondarily acquired. This is well
shown in the case of the oral angle pieces. These pieces are formed, as is well known,
by the fusion at an early stage of a, and ad,, no line of demarcation being visible and
processes of the two growing ossicles becoming inextricably entangled; later a
transverse suture appears dividing this compound piece into two parts which are
sometimes spoken of as a, and ad,, a proceeding which is clearly inaccurate. This
suture is doubtless adaptive and is already present in Ophioderma egertoni.

Ig is satisfactory to find that there is no conflict between the evidence, such as it is,
