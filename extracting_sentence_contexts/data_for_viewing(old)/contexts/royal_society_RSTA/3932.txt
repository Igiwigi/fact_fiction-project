the presence of high percentages of Ag [30,31]. The presence of silver is unusual in fire gilding
because this method permits production costs to be reduced without resorting to the mix of gold
with other metals.

Switching to the molecular analysis, more than 80 Raman spectra were collected, allowing the
identification of four iron oxide phases. The blackish corrosion spots were composed of magnetite
(Fe304, Raman peaks at 542 and 669 cm~!), a stable iron oxide whose formation is favoured by
anoxic environments [32]. In the orange-brownish corrosion layers, three iron oxyhydroxides
where found: goethite, lepidocrocite and akaganeite. Goethite (a-FeOOH, Raman peaks at 247,
301, 388, 482, 552 and 546cmâ„¢!) is a stable compound forming a protective layer on the spur
core. On the other hand, lepidocrocite (y-FeQOH, Raman peaks at 250, 379, 525 and 650 cm7!)
and akaganeite (FeOg gg3(OH)1.167Clo.167, Raman peaks at 311, 390, 537 and 722 cm!) are reactive
phases that can be considered as degradation accelerators [6,21]. In fact, akaganeite is the most
dangerous one because the presence of chloride ions in its molecular structure increases the
porosity of the corrosion layer, facilitating cracks and swellings [33,34].

(b) Laboratory analysis

(i) Surface analysis

As explained above, laboratory analyses were carried out on M01 and M02 fragments to better
understand the characteristic of the decorative layer and the surface degradation.

SEM-EDS maps of sample M01 allowed us to study in depth the nature of the gilded layer. The
elemental image (figure 1c) obtained by use of INCA software showed a degraded silver layer.
