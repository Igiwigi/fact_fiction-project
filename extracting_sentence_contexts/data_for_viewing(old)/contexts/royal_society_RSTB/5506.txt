in the hyoid arch, a bar of cartilage has appeared above the stylohyal, separated from
the latter by a narrow interval. This small bar is the laterohyal, and both it and the
stylohyal are merely independent chondrifications in the blastema of the hyoid arch,
which will eventually fuse to give rise to RetcuERt’s cartilage, and later form the
styloid process.

The thyrohyal cartilages, representing the skeleton of the 3rd visceral arch, are as
in the previous stage. ‘The thyroid cartilages, when seen from the ventral side, show that
each possesses a pair of processes directed ventrally, one behind the other. The only
interpretation of this condition seems to be that the thyroid cartilage represents the
skeletal elements of two visceral arches, viz., the 4th and 5th. This will account for
the two processes or wings, one corresponding to each arch, and it will also explain the
fact that the thyroid cartilage is larger than the skeletal elements of the other visceral]
arches. In this respect, therefore, the rabbit may be regarded as falling into line with
Monotremes and Marsupials, in possessing thyroid cartilages composed of the elements
of two visceral arches. Whether in remaining Eutheria, in all of which the thyroid carti-
lages have been supposed to consist of one visceral arch only, the conditions resemble
those of the rabbit can only be decided by further investigation, probable though it
may seem.

Another remarkable feature of this stage is the presence of a pair of small spherical
cartilages situated immediately median to the ventral extremities of the posterior wings
of the thyroid cartilages. These structures, representing, as they must, the ventral
skeletal elements of the 5th visceral arch may be termed the hypothyroid cartilages.
