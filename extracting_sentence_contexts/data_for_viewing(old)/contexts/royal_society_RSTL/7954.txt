to his recent visit to England, Dr. Dawsox held the views of the French botanist
as strongly as he himself does; and when he saw the specimen in question, he unhesi-

examples, which led the Canadian geologist to declare to the Geological Society of London
that « specimens in the collection of Professor WILLIAMSON show forms intermediate be-
