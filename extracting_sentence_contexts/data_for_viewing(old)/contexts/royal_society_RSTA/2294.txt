again, 14 must be 1. However, 1 and 14 cannot be both assigned the value 1, which concludes the
proof.


Figure 1. The set in the original proof of KS has 117 vectors and 118 contexts. Each node represents a vector. Connected nodes
represent mutually orthogonal vectors. The red node 1is orthogonal to all nodes connected by a red edge, and similarly for green
and yellow. (Online version in colour.)

The KS theorem is usually presented in two equivalent ways, which mirror the presentation
given above. The first is in terms of joint measurements of compatible dichotomic (yes/no)
observables, i.e. the projectors {Pj}; above, and the second in terms of single trichotomic
measurements, i.e. in the basis {|i), |j), |k)}, or, equivalently, a POVM with effects {|i)(i|, |j)(j|, |K)(KI}.
This is due to the fact that the measurement in the basis {|i), |j), |k)} represents a joint measurement
of the three projectors P;, Pj, Pr, with Py = |a)a|, « =i,j,k. We may call the above perspectives,
respectively, the ‘observable perspective’ (OP) and the ‘effect perspective’ (EP). In EP, we
are interested in the value assignment to effects of a measurements, independently of which
measurement the same effect appears in, e.g. the assignment of {0,1} to the effect |i)(i|,
independently of which basis |i) belongs to. In OP, we are interested in the assignment of a value
to observables, independently of which joint measurement they belong to, e.g. the assignment of
a value to P;, independently of whether it is measured together with P; or Py.

The equivalence of these two perspectives is due to the fact that the KS theorem is discussed
in the context of sharp measurements. This is no longer true if the measurements we are
considering are unsharp. The discussion of unsharp measurement is necessary for the connection
of KS-type contradictions with experimental tests. In fact, due to practical limitations and
