Now the rostrum of the parasphenoid of the lizard develops in the embryo just in
front of the hypophysial fenestra and grows forwards, while the vomer of Ornitho-
rhynchus appears below the nasal septum and grows backwards. This means that by
assuming fixed relations for the prevomers, profound changes in relations are deduced
for the vomers. In fact, the centre of ossification is held to have migrated so far
forward that it is necessary for the bone to grow backward in order to occupy its final
position (figure 94, B). Moreover, it will be shown later that other important changes
are implied if the paraseptal cartilages alone are used as guides to identification.
