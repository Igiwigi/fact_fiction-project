Green colouring matter, with resin,
alkali, and lime, appeared in the negative vessel: and the
positive vessel contained a clear fluid, which had the smell
of peach blossoms ; and which, when neutralized by potash,
gave a blue-green precipitate to solution of sulphate of iron ;
$0 that it contained vegetable prussic acid. A small plant of mint, in a state of healthy vegetation, was
made the medium of connection in the battery, its extremities
being in contact with pure water ; the process was carried on
for 10 minutes : potash and lime were found in the negatively
electrified water, and acid matter in the positively electrified
water, which occasioned a precipitate in solutions of muriate
of barytes, nitrate of silver, and muriate of lime. This plant
recovered after the process : but a similar one, that had been

electrified for four hours with like results, faded and died.*
The facts shew that the electrical powers of decomposition
act even upon living vegetable matter; and there are some
phznomena which seem to prove that they operate likewise
upon living animal systems. When the fingers, after having
been carefully washed with pure water, are brought in con-
tact with this fluid in the positive part of the circuit, acid
matter is rapidly developed, having the characters of a mix-
ture of muriatic, phosphoric, and sulphuric acids : and if a
similar trial be made in the negative part, fixed alkaline matter
is as quickly exhibited. The acid and alkaline tastes produced upon the tongue, in
Garvanic experiments, seem to depend upon the decompo-
sition of the saline matter contained in the living animal sub-
stance, and perhaps in the saliva.
