It is clear that the foregoing theory of liquids is not free from objection, and that in
some respects it appears to be less satisfactory than existing theories. The most
obvious objection is that it seems to be incompatible with accepted determination of
the molecular weight of liquids. Since, however, these experiments are based ultimately
on kinetic considerations, the author believes that this difficulty will not in fact arise
unless the requisite bonds between the molecules of each group are found to be sufficiently
strong to cause appreciable modification of the average molecular kinetic energy. 12. Summary of Conclusions.
