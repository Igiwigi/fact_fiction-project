are of interest for themselves and also provide characters that may be of use in com-
parative morphology. The observations made on the well-preserved spines have not
only confirmed previous statements as to their being flattened in the vertical plane, but
have added some structural details. No evidence is forthcoming that the appendages
had a vascular supply, though the nature of the preservation does not justify a definite
negative conclusion on this point. The fact that no stomata have been found, although
the pattern of elongated epidermal cells was more or less evident, supports the view that
stomata were absent from the spines. These negative observations are confirmatory
of views that have been expressed by previous investigators (HALLE, 1916; Epwarps,
1924) that these structures were not specialised organs of assimilation and should be
regarded as ‘‘ emergences”’ rather than “ leaves.”

Some other facts give further support to this view. One is the apparent irregularity
of position of the spines, and especially the way in which examples of the most diverse

sizes may be found attached close together on the surface of the stem. Another set of
facts concerns the terminal region. It has been pointed out that there are features
which render it possible, or even probable, that the tip of the spine was in some way of a
glandular nature. If this were so, we should be dealing with an axis clothed with secretory
emergences. The facts given in the body of the paper do not amount to a demonstra-
tion of this presumption, but they all appear consistent with it, and it is difficult other-
wise to account for the occurrence of spines with open tubular tips, not due to accidental
