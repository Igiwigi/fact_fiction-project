minish, the original stock of that substance belonging to that
instrument ; consequently, the instrument will neither be heated,
nor cooled, by these interchanges, but will continue invariably
at the same constant temperature.

This explanation is plausible; but, before the hypothesis on
which it is founded can be admitted, we must see if it will agree
with the results of other experiments; for the greatest care
ought always to be used in the admission of hypotheses in phy-
sical researches ; and, in no case can it be more indispensably
necessary, than where an hypothesis has evidently been con-
trived for the sole purpose of explaining a single experiment, or
elucidating a new fact.

When the surface of the metallic disk B was blackened, by
holding it over the flame of a candle, the intensity of its radiation,

at the given temperature, (that of 112%) was found to be
very considerably increased; and when (being 80 blackened) it
was again presented to the ball of the thermoscope, at the same
distance as in the last-mentioned experiment, and the cold disk
A (at the temperature of g2*) was placed opposite to it, at an
