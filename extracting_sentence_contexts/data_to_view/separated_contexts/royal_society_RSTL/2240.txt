To obtain a distinct view of the whole extent of the posterior tract, we require to

* The terms pons and nodus are sufficiently intelligible and harmless, as implying no theory ; I retain the
old names unless the new ones be countenanced by the just eminence of the authors who have invented them,
This is the proper check against the mutiplication of terms in anatomy. In dezcribing the course of the fibres,

the cerebellum, we may split them at the posterior fissure and fold them aside. We now survey the extent of the fourth yentricle.
