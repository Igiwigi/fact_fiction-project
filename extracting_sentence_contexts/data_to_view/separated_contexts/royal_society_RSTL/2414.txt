Royal. Read June 16, 1825. W urxzver any difference of opinion exists on philosophical
subjects depending on experiment or observation, it is much
more useful simply to state facts, than to reason on them
prematurely. Having this principle in view, I am induced to
transmit to the Society the annexed small Table, which con-
tains the annual variations of some of the fixed stars, as
deduced both from Dr. BzinkLEy's observations and my
own, and by which each may be compared with the annual
variations determined by very distant observations, according
to the more usual method.
