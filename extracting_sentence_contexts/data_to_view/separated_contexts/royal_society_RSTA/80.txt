Following
these ideas, the authors have recently introduced a model of vegetation density for water-limited
regions where only competition among plants is considered [3]. Here, the interaction enters by
allowing the growth rate of a plant to diminish with the number of other individuals competing
with it for resources (water). Despite the fact that facilitation is ignored, this non-local competition
model produces a spectrum of spatial patterns similar to the one observed in models assuming
that both facilitation and competition are necessary. In this paper, we extend the results of Martinez-Garcia et al. [3] to address several open
questions. (i) Do patterns depend on how competition enters in the dynamical equations?
(ii) What is the role of nonlinearities? (iii) Can simple models featuring non-local competition be
derived from more fundamental ones that consider the dynamics of plants and water sources? To
answer these questions, we present a set of non-local models with only competitive interactions
that enter in the equations either linearly or nonlinearly.
