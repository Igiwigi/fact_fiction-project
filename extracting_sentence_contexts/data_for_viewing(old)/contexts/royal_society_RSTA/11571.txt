minutes, until, approximately, the above ratio was obtained. Effects of this kind
have already been described in detail (see §9). At low temperatures the positive
ionisation obtained with this apparatus seemed to be different in character, for it was

[* Note added September 7, 1906.—It seems advisable to indicate the exact hearing of this argument
more precisely. It is intended to confirm the conclusion, which has been drawn from direct experiment
on page 52, that the high value of the negative ionisation in a vacuum containing traces of hydrogen is
due to the fact that the hydrogen keeps the surface of the wire in a certain state, rather than that the
wire contains a certain amount of hydrogen. The writer does not wish to create the impression that
hydrogen never exerts a direct influence on the magnitude of the negative leak. The numbers on
p. 53 show that the value of the ionisation, at constant temperature, increases with the pressure of
the hydrogen at high pressures; so that it is probable that at high pressures there is a negative leak
which is a definite function of the pressure of the hydrogen. This is also demanded by the fact that the
constant _, which enters into the temperature formula, is dependent on the pressure.

A comparison of the table at the top of page 53 with that on page 52 would seem to indicate that the
ionisation in hydrogen at 1:9 millims. pressure is much greater than in a hydrogen vacuum, The writer
considers, however, that these experiments are not comparable with one another, owing to the wires having
been differently treated before the two experiments. The direct tests made on pp. 50 and 51 showed that
decreasing the pressure from about 1 millim. to ‘001 millim. only reduced the ionisation in hydrogen by
about 40 per cent. of its value.]
