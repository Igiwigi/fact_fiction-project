to October; the mean lag for the barometric pressure for the 12 months comes to
yy of an hour, but the exceptionally early hour of the potential minimum in October
; is responsible for more than half this difference.

In the case of the forenoon maximum there is exact agreement in the hour in
eight months, and the mean lag in barometric pressure for the 12 months is only
+ hour. :

December is the only month when the afternoon minima accord in time, and the
mean lag for the barometric pressure is 14 hours. The corresponding quantity for
the afternoon maxima is 24 hours.

If the relation is a case of cause and effect, the fact that it is the barometer curve
that lags relative to the other would naturally lead one to regard the potential
variation rather as the cause than the effect.

ยง 28. When we consider the variation from month to month in the amplitudes of
the diurnal inequalities other differences appear. This will be seen on comparing
Table XVII. with Tables IIT. and. IV. The first column in Table XVII. gives the
range, or difference between greatest and least hourly values, in the diurnal
inequality of barometric pressure; the second column the numerical sum of the
24 hourly differences from the mean for the day. The corresponding potential
quantities will be found in the two last columns of Table III. The ranges and the
sum of the differences show analogous phenomena, but the latter are the better for
comparison, because they give a smoother annual variation when the number of years
