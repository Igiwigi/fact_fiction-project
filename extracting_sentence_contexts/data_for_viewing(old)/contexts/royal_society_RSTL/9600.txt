also obtained rhythmic response to constant stimulation in the case of the Snail's
heart.

The only other observation bearing on this subject with which I have met, is one
that was published by Dr. BukÞEN SANDERSON and Mr. PAGsg in the © Proceedings of
the Royal Society.” The tissxwe on which these observers experimented was the
excitable leaf of Dionea, and they were able to show that slightly less than minimal
stimulation produces rhythmic response in these tissues. The response in this case
was estimated, not by the occurrence of a contraction—the stimulation employed being
too feeble to cause any contraction—bub by the occurrence of the electrical disturbance
which, as these authors have shown, always constitutes the first result of stimulation,
and therefore takes place even in cases where the stimulus is nob strong enough to
cause contraction. The following are the words in which the fact is stated by its
observers :—* When a leaf is excited at regular intervals by single shocks of 8uch
intensity as to be just beyond the limit of adequacy, 80 that the slightest diminution
would render them futile, it is s0metimes observed that the effects become rhythmical.
Thus, in a series of 54 successive excitations, we obtained the following results :— |
Excitations 1, 2, 3, and 4, were effectual ; but of the 16 excitations following every
other was futile, the alternate ones only being followed by excursions (7.e., of the
electrometer) ; then followed during eight minutes a series of futile excitations, after
which the leaf was allowed to rest for two minutes. On resuming, the alternate
rhythm again appeared for six excitations, then becoming modified, 80 that an
excursion followed every fourth instead of every third excitation, a state of things
which continued for a quarter of an hour.”
