embezzle funds compared to the rival party (based on [59]); the
scenario is provided in the electronic supplementary material.

Each report comprised 10 statements, with the key information

in the Democratic worldview-congruent conditions stated that
‘The study found that Republican politicians over the last three
decades were more than three times as likely to misappropriate
public funds compared to Democratic politicians’. In the retrac-
tion condition, the corresponding statement 9 stated that: ’...the
lead author...clarified...that the study results had been misrepre-
sented and that Republican politicians were not, in fact, more
likely than Democrats to misappropriate public funds’.
Participants in no-retraction conditions were presented with

inferential-reasoning items were open-ended questions designed

good headline for the report about the study?’); the remaining six
