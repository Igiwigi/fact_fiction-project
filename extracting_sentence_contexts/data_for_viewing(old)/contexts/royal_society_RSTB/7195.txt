is drawn in outline with two small areas A and B marked, and with axes X and Y indicated.
The Z axis is normal to the plane of the drawing. In the same figure, A and B are drawn on
a larger scale to show, again in outline only, the arrangement of the scales on the wing, as
seen in a pupa of about 140 hr. The insets, A and B, also include diagrammatic sections of
these two regions of the wing. Defined in terms of the axes, X, Y and Z, the plane of the
wing-surface is the X, Y plane; a transverse section of the wing is a section in the Y, Z plane;
a longitudinal section is a section in the X, Z plane. The figure also records the fact that the
scales are bristle-like on the anterior and posterior margins, paddle-shaped on the lateral
margin and typically flattened on the body of the wing. The regions A and B are viewed
along the Z axis, normal to the wing-surface. The stippled area to the right of the rudiments
in B is the marginal zone of the pupal wing.

3. BIREFRINGENCE OF DEVELOPING WING SCALES IN EPHESTIA SERICARIUM (SCOTT)

At about 72 hr. after pupation under the conditions described, the lateral marginal scale
rudiments on anterior wings of LE. sericarium are seen to be positively birefringent with
respect to the long axis of the rudiment (the slow vibration direction is parallel to the long
axis) when formalin-fixed wings are examined in water. The rudiment is, in fact, bire-
fringent as soon as it can be recognized, that is, at a length of 6 to 74. Figure 4, plate 1,
