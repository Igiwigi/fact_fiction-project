110. An examination of this Table shows that the action is by no means confined to
the rays usually called heat, 7. e. to the extreme- and ultra-red of the spectrum. 'The
strong action obtained when the light is filtered through greenish glass and alum, or
through ammonio-sulphate of copper, shows that luminous rays produce a similar |
moyement of repulsion.

Unfavourable weather has prevented me from obtaining good quantitative results with
the different rays of the solar spectrum ; but I haye tried numerous qualitative experi-
ments which leave no doubt on my mind that any ray, from the invisible ultra-red to
the invisible ultra-violet, will produce repulsion in a vacuum. The following is an
experiment tried with the electric light. The spectrum was formed with a complete
quartz train, no glass whatever being in the path of the rays. The purity of the
spectrum was evidenced by the fact of the lines being sharp when thallium, sodium, or
lithium was put between the carbon poles. The spectrum was s0 arranged that any
desired ray could be thrown on to a lampblacked pith surface, screens being interposed
to cut, off the action when desired. The torsion-balance was similar to the one used in
the last-named series of experiments (104), but was not quite s0 sensitive.

The extreme-red rays were first brought into position. On removing the screen the
luminous index moved 9 divisions on the scale. The screen being replaced, the index
returned to zero. A solution of iodine in disulphide of carbon was now interposed, and
the screen again removed. The repulsion was almost as strong as before, showing that
this liquid was transparent to the ultra-red rays.

The iodine s0lution was then replaced by a clear plate of alum 5 millims. thick, and
