28. Here again computation was made more laborious by the occurrence of r in the
‘relaxation pattern’. The nature of the requisite modification was never in doubt; for an
increase in the assumed value of k, unaccompanied by any change in the assumed shape,
decreases 7 everywhere according to (33), while an increase given at some point to the radius
of the jet entails a reduction at that point of 4é and therefore of 1 - and 7. At neighbouring
points it increases 7 by rendering the jet more concave: consequently errors of opposite
sign could be eliminated by changing the shape of the free stream-line, errors all of like sign
by changing k.

In fact only two changes of k were necessary, since the second (by good fortune) led to
negligible errors at all points. Initially p was assumed to have the value 0-71, and sub-
sequently this was altered to 0-75 and 0-78 (the accepted figure). Our first attempts were
made on a net fairly coarse in all parts, since it was apparent that a finer mesh near B would
yield for that point a value of dy/dv higher by an amount fairly easy to estimate.

One point perhaps calls for notice: —In § 26, by taking 27y-, as a measure of the total flow,
we gave ‘dimensional’ significance to y, whereas in the computations r, z, v, a were (as is
necessary) treated as ‘non-dimensional’. But the point has no importance in this example,
because the boundary conditions, namely, (11) of §5, are still satisfied when y is multiplied
by any constant quantity (the constants on their right-hand sides being multiplied similarly).

* “.. .this coefficient is found experimentally to be about 0-62’ (Lamb 1932, § 24).
