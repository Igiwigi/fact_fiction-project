ReGxavir found by direct measurement the expansion of mercury to be
U,=U,(1+0:0001815f). On comparing the values given in Table XL., it will be seen how closely DzseRETz's
and the last series agree, whereas Korr's and DEsPRETZ'S results do not agree, although
obtained by the same process. Bearing these facts in mind, we must conclude that,
Koyy's coefficients for the expansion of water are too low, (1) as the coefficient of expan-
sion of mercury falls below that found by RE6xXauLT when deduced by means of Korr's
coefficient ; (2) as the said coefficients are lower than those obtained by other observers ;
and (3) as the coefficient of mercury when deduced by means of those obtained for water
by the above-mentioned observers agrees closely with that found by Re&xAuLT; for had
1 employed DxseRETz's coefficients instead of my own, I should have deduced very nearly
the same yalue for the coefficient of expansion for mercury. In conclusion I may be allowed to express my thanks to the gentlemen who have
assisted in carrying out the foregoing research ; to Professor Hiksr for his kindness in
suggesting methods of reduction and calculation, to Mr. BasszTT and Dr. Max BErEND
for the able manner in which they assisted in the experimental part, and to Dr. C. Voc
for his undertaking the greater part of the computations. WY TN ON CC EFICECFE— I
