A SWARM OF METEORITES, AND ON THEORIES OF COSMOGONY. 63

In $9 two criteria, suggested by this line of thought, are found. They measure,
roughly speaking, the degree of curvature of the average path pursued by a meteorite
between two collisions. These two criteria, denoted D/L and A/C, will afford a
measure of the applicability of hydrodynamics in the sense above indicated.

After these preliminary investigations, we have to consider what kind of meeting
of two meteorites will amount to an “ encounter” within the meaning of the kinetic
theory. Is it possible, in fact, that two meteorites can considerably bend their paths
under the influence of gravitation when they pass near one another? This question
is answered in § 8, where a formula is found for the deflection of the path of each of a
pair of meteorites, when, moving with their mean relative velocity, they graze past
one another without striking. It appears from the formula that, unless they have the
dimensions of small planets, the mutual gravitational influence is practically insensible.
Hence, nothing short of absolute impact is to be considered an encounter in the
kinetic theory ; and what is called the radius of “the sphere of action” is simply the
distance between the centres of a pair when they graze, and is, therefore, the sum of
their radii, or, if of uniform size, the diameter of one of them.

The next point to consider is the mass and size which must be attributed to the
meteorites.
