sound ceased likewise. The Professor limited himself to the description of the phe-
nomenon and made no attempt to explain it.

In the year 1829 Mr. ArTaur TrEveLyan was engaged in spreading pitch with a
hot plastering iron, and observing in one instance that the iron was too hot, he laid
it slantingly against a block of lead which happened to be at hand. Shortly after-
wards he heard a shrill note, resembling that produced on the chanter of the smaller
Northumberland pipes, an instrument played by his father's gamekeeper. Not know-
ing the cause of the sound he thought that this person might be practising out of
doors, but on going out the tone ceased to be heard, while on his return he heard it
as 8hrill as before. His attention was at length attracted to the hot iron, which he
found to be in a state of vibration, and thus discovered the origin of this strange
music. In 1830 he came to Edinburgh and mentioned the fact to Dr. Re1D ; the latter,

not knowing what Scuwartz and G1LBERT had observed previously, regarded the
phenomenon as new and recommended Mr. TRrEvELYan to investigate it more fully.
Mr. TzeveLyan did 80; among other things he discovered the form to be given to
the vibrating mass (the rocker) in order to obtain the effect with ease and certainty.
The resalts of his numerous and well-contrived experiments were communicated to
the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and were snbsequently printed in the Society's
