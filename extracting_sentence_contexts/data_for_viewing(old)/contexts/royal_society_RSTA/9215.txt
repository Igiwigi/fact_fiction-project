similar displacements ending at 24912 (No. 38) with all the previous displacements
annulled. In 39404 above there is a similar example of the chain stopping when
the displacements cut out.

From 25387 (c¢ 3) the chain passes to a separate map to escape excessive crowding.
Tn the next two lines we get two repeated 3, displacements in ¢ links which return to
normality in the third. The line 58271 is from Hanpkr’s ultra-violet lines and is
affected with considerable possible observation error. The formule are continued

from this, but with increasing doubt as to spurious links. In fact the long succession
of p links in series in the lower part would seem to point to connection with a diffuse
linkage. The presence of such a spurious link is shown directly also by the appearance
of the line 27783 in two places, cols. d and g indicating a eyele.

AuP. P, (1) = 41172794, P,(1) = 37357°62, P(#) = 7063812. The linkage as
shown in the map is much smaller than in the case of Ag. This is doubtless due to the
fact that in both cases the chains start with the long series of ¢ links. In Ag several
of these in succession lead up to the ultra-violet region from which chains run back
again towards longer wave-lengths. In the case of Au, however, two of these
long e links carry right across the observed region, and if the Au linkage is analogous
to that of Ag, the points from which linkages would run back again are beyond the
observed. Possibly some may exist amongst HanpKr’s ultra-violet, but the observed
