Since g € I’, we have gic € S(C) for all C € M. Thus, by
condition (iii) of the definition of a possibilistic empirical model, g € S(X), which means
that g is a global section extending x. This contradicts the fact that S is logically contextual
at x. We conclude that x ¢ 7!“ Thus (Cy) 4 S(Co), hence K disagrees globally.

— We will now prove that K disagrees completely if and only if S is strongly contextual. Recall that the null element of the algebra is the emptyset zx = J.
