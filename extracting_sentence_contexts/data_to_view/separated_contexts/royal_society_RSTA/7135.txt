v = €+-in, we find from (4-2) that 4, is real on the axis 7 = 0 and also on the ellipse

whose foci are at the branch points v = tic; where the ellipse cuts the real axis, 5, is sta-
tionary. As v moves along the real axis from +00 to (4+ 2//)~', thence round either half
of the ellipse to — (4 4+2/f)~t, and thence to —o, b, increases steadily from 99 to ~ 00.
its values on the ellipse ranging between the positive values

Since (4:2) gives a,—v =/—4,, a,—v runs on the ellipse between the same two values. Hence the following facts:

(i) For v on the positive real axis, h, has neither poles nor zeros;

(ii) On the ellipse, h, has no poles, and has zeros at the conjugate pairs of points where b, ~ 1,2, «+5
which exist if B>(2+4/2)/7; one or more pairs of these zeros is in the right half-plane if p > 2; for
f = 2-5 they are v = 0-11-0911 (where b, = 1), and v = —0-3 40-8431 (where b, — 2).

(iii) On the negative real axis h, has an infinity of both poles and zeros. The behaviour of /, when |v | is large may be found by noting that (4-2) give
a,=v(1+a)+4P+O0(v"'), b,=—va+4f+O(v-}) (4:6)
and thence, with Stirling’s theorem, approximating to the gamma functions in (4°5); we
