And VI., there is a remarkable coincidence between the
temperature of different regions, and the prevalence of certain forms of Crustacea.—It
is interesting to obserye, that the want of a high temperature is no obstacle to the
growth and multiplication of individuals of a comparatively small size and low grade
of organization ; the Arctic and Antarctic seas being as numerously peopled with
such, as the tropical ocean is with higher forms. But the preceding statements point
to a direct and definite relation between Heat and the Organizing force, as mani-
fested in this group of animals. A comparison of the facts relating to the geographical
distribution of other classes of cold-blooded animals would probably justify the same
conclusions. There can be no doubt of their general applicability to the Vegetable
kingdom.

5. The influence of temperature upon the general vital activity of cold-blooded
animals is no less remarkable, The facts determined by the experiments of Dr.
