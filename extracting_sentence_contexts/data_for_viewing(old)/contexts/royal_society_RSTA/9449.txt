There is no difficulty in explaining, on the lines of the hydroxylation theory, the
facts comprised under (1) and (3), especially in view of the strong tendency there
would always be for a non-stop passage from CH, to CH,(OH),, without any breaking
down at the intermediate CH;.OH stage.

In the case of the equimolecular mixture, CH,+0,, the primary oxidation may thus
be represented as a single transaction,

CH,+0, = [H,:C:(OH),] = H,:C:0+H,0
ip â€”;
CO+H,,

involving the formation of steam but no separation of carbon. The facts observed
with the mixture 2CH,+0,, may also be explained on the supposition that in the
primary oxygen attack half of the methane molecules are directly transformed into
CH,(OH),, and that the heat so liberated is sufficient to decompose part of the other
half of the methane into its elements, the remainder being found intact after the
explosion.

To explain the non-separation of carbon when the mixture 3CH,+20,, was exploded,
it must be supposed that whilst one-third of the methane is directly transformed into
CH,OH),, the other two-thirds cannot, for lack of oxygen, get beyond the CH,.0H
