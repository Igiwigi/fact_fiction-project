As would be anticipated from the character of the contours in figures 4 and 5, the numerical
evaluation of the integral (2-19), using the numerical tables from which the figures are
drawn, presents no difficulty for positive values of h not too near to unity, or for negative
values in the range —}<h<0. For the range —1<h<~—4, the integration is very trouble-
some, not only owing to the integral being made up of three parts with ‘awkward’ limits,

but also owing to the behaviour of the integrand near these limits. Similar behaviour is
encountered in connexion with the integration for 4 = 1, associated with the fact that for
6->+ 90°, dé/d0->co. The method of dealing with these integrations is outlined in § 3, and
the results, along with others, are given in § 4. Solutions of equation for stationary energy in special cases

Useful explicit solutions of the stationary energy equation (2-10), treating ¢ as the un-
known, are obtainable in the forms ¢(h) and ¢() for only a limited number of particular
values of @ and h respectively.
