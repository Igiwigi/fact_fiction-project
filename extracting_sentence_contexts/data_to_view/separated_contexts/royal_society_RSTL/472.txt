With 65 of oxygen,
it becomes more fixed, like sulphuric acid; has a stronger
affinity for salifiable bases; and acquires more truly acid pro-
perties. Upon these considerations, I submit to the chemical
world, whether, in the present state of our knowledge, it be
not more philosophical to say,

Muriatic radical, or

some single word Muriatic acid ;

of thesameimport, pinstead of:

Muriatous acid, Oxygenized muriatic acid;
Auriatic acid, Hyperoxygenised muriatic acid. I am fully aware that, at first sight, this may appear extraor-
dinary; and the more 50, as we have no positive facts that
prove muriatic acid to be a simple body. All we can, therefore,
consider fairly, is, in favour of which appellation does the sum
of analogies scem to preponderate, And, to give the cause a
candid investigation, we should begin by considering, whether
the presence of oxygen in all bodies that have acid properties,
has been rigidly demonstrated; and not determine by this law
of the French chemistry, till we are well convinced it has not
been too generally assumed. If a nomenclature be not subservient to the uses of science,
and does not keep pace with its progress, the relation between
