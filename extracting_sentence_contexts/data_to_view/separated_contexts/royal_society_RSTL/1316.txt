The same numbers agree in ge-
neral with the order of simple elective attractions, as usually
laid down by chemical authors; but it was of so much less
importance to accommodate them to these, that I have not
been very solicitous to avoid a few inconsistencies in this re-
spect, especially as many of the bases of the calculation remain
uncertain, and as the common tables of simple elective attrac-
tions are certainly imperfect, if they are considered as indi-
cating the order of the independent attractive forces of the
substances concerned. Although it cannot be expected that
these numbers should be accurate measures of the forces
which they represent, yet they may be supposed to be tolera-
ble approximations to such measures, at least if any two of
them are nearly in the true proportion, it is probable that the
rest cannot deviate very far from it: thus, if the attractive
force of the phosphoric acid for potash is about eight tenths
of that of the sulfuric acid for barita, that of the phosphoric
acid for barita must be about nine tenths as great; but they
are calculated only to agree with a certain number of pheno-
mena, and will probably require many alterations, as well as:
additions, when all other similar phenomena shall have been
accurately investigated. There is, however, a method of representing the facts, which

have served as the bases of the determination, independently
of any hypothesis, and without being liable to the contingent
necessity of any future alteration, in order to. make room for
the introduction of the affections of other substances; and this
method enables us also to compare, upon general principles,
a multitude of scattered phenomena, and to reject many which |
have been mentioned as probable, though doubtful, with the
omission of a very few only which have been stated as ascer-
tained. This arrangement simply depends on the supposition,
that' the attractive force, which tends to unite any two sub-
stances, may always be represented by a certain constant
quantity.
