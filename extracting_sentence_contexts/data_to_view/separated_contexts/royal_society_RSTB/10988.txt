Small differences in procedure can
greatly affect the performance in a numerical task, even
within the same species [93]; hence, methodological variability
must be taken into account in comparative studies. Even when
animals are tested in identical conditions, other concurrent fac-
tors intrinsically related to the tested species may prevent a
reliable comparison. Comparing monkeys and dogs in a com-
puter task with visual stimuli, for example, may be affected by
the fact that dogs are typically less reliant on vision than pri-
mates. Interspecific differences in personality and motivation
can also be critical factors when comparing different species
in the same task. For example, the different metabolic require-
ments of warm- and cold-blooded vertebrates could have
significant effects on motivation and, therefore, affect perform-
ance in both food quantity discrimination tests and training
experiments that use food as a reward.
