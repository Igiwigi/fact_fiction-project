'= By detonating ordinary cotton, we can never obtain an explosion ; and, similarly, unless
EY the general contractile tissues of these Medusz were in some way prepared to respond
EZ in a different manner to the different kinds of marginal or ganglionic discharge, we
| Z should never observe a spasm. 5 (f) Another solution of the difficulty may possibly present itself as worthy of consi-
Y deration. Bearing in mind the facts already adduced with regard to the high degree

5 * As tho polypite of Staurophora Taciniata is spread out over the radial tubes, it is not improbable that
& ganglionic elements may hero occur. + Tt may perhaps be thought that this is too strong a statement, Considering that, in the yarious species of
Tiqaropsis, spasmodic motions result when any part of the irritable tissues are stimulated, it may appear that
a zpasm differs from an ordinary contraction only in the degree of its intensity ; and therefore that, in
Staurophora, direct stimulation of the ganglia is followed by a spasxm only because a greater amount of
ordinary ganglionic influence is thus caused to be liberated than would be the case in a merely spontaneous
discharge.
