Happily these means of testing are vastly superior to those
then prevailing and available in Farapay’s early days. As a consequence his results are
now seen in a very different light from that in which they have hitherto been regarded. It is many years since the author first read the two papers by Sropart and Farapay
presented to the Royal Institution and the Royal Society, and he has long been familiar
with Farapay’s remarkable books “Chemical Manipulation” and “ Experiments in
Chemistry and Physics.” On many occasions he has drawn attention to the fact that
FaRapay was interested in and experimented on alloy steels, but he freely confesses that
he had not appreciated the full importance and significance of this work until the
opportunity arose of examining the specimens which Farapay prepared. FARADAY’S “STEEL AND ALLOYS.” 229

In August of last year the author saw a few of these specimens of Farapay’s steel
at the Science Museum, South Kensington, where they had been placed on exhibition,
under the care of Sir Henry Lyons, F.R.S., during the recent period of reconstruction of
the Royal Institution building. In view of the fact that a general exhibition of
Farapay’s instruments, apparatus and othermaterial was to be held during the Farapay
Celebrations at the Albert Hall, under the management of a special Committee, with
Colonel Vianoues as its Chairman, the author suggested that it would be interesting
and appropriate to have these specimens of Farapay’s steel subjected to analysis and
other examination.
