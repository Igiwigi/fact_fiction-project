This result is opposed to that given by THoRNER (op. cit.), who says-
that a layer of olive oil 2 millims. in thickness over water prevented any noteworthy
absorption of pure CO, in 9 hours. Through a layer of paraffin oil the passage '*

ical experiments it must also be allowed for.

‘The facts that I present are by no means new, but they seem to have quite
ped out of general knowledge, and, as seen above, have been in some cases
ied. After my enquiries had been answered in the laboratory, I came upon an
ly clue in the literature, which led me to Gununr’s ‘ Physikalisches Handworter-
wich,’ 1825, in which it is stated that PrrmstiEy discovered the solubility of CO, in
ve oil, and another investigator determined it quantitatively for linseed and
ender oils. The former takes up 1°5 vols. of CO, at 18°C., and the latter
vols., while water only dissolves 1:0 vol.
