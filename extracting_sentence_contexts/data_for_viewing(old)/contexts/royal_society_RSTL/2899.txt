fig. 3., and a secondary circuit be formed as before with the cell No. 1. by the wire
abede, a portion of the main current flowing from the copper of No. 5. to the zine
of No. 1, instead of passing through the electrolyte from & to h, finds a passage
throngh the wire abcde to h, and consequently will appear to flow in an opposite
direction to the primary current or from the zinc to the copper. The resistance of
the circuits may be s0 adjusted that the current may sometimes take one course and
sometimes the opposite, and produce those oscillations of the needle from E. to W.
which have been just described.

The breaking of the secondary circuit did not affect the galvanometer of the pri-
mary current, but the breaking of the primary circuit always turned the secondary
current into the normal direction, and increased the deviation of its needle; it re-
duced it, in fact, to the condition of the direct current from the single cell.

It is however obvious that these diverted currents of the complete circuit would
not of themselves be sufficient to account for the stoppage of the main battery current
of which we are in search ; nor has it yet been shown how they were produced when
the main circuit was broken, as represented at fig. 1. In search of the explanation of
these phenomena I turned my attention to the influence of the metallic steam-vessel
upon the voltaic arrangement.

When the battery was connected in the usual way with a galvanometer, and the
needle was deflected 80? E., if the zinc electrode were lifted and made to touch the
tin case in any part, it would remain deflected in the same direction 30%, If, on the
other hand, the main circuit were broken at the copper electrode, and it were brought
