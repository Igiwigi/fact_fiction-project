In the single-and-double-letter notation we have six letters A, B, C, D, E, F;
and the duads AB, AC, ... DE are used as abbreviations for the double triads
ABF, CDE, &e., the letter F always accompanying the expressed duad ; there are
thus in all six single-letter symbols, and 10 double-letter symbols, in all 16 symbols,
corresponding to the double-theta functions, as already mentioned in the order

9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 I 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 1

BD, CE, CD, BE, AC, C, AB, B, BC, DE, F, A, AD, D, E, AE

where observe that the single letters C, B, F, A, D, E correspond to the odd functions
5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14 respectively.

75. The ground of the notation is as follows :—

The algebraical relations between the double theta-functions are such that intro-
ducing six constant quantities a, b, ec, d, e, f and two variable quantities (&, y) it is
allowable to express the 16 functions as proportional to given functions of these quan-
tities (a, b, c, d, e, f; z, y); viz.: there are six functions the notations of which depend
on the single letters a, b, c, d, e, f respectively, and 10 functions the notations of
which depend on the pairs ab, ac, ad, ae, be, bd, be, cd, ce, de respectively: each of the
16 functions is in fact proportional to the product of two factors, viz.: a constant factor
depending only on («, Þ, e, d, e, /'), and a variable factor containing also @ and ys
Attending in the first instance to the variable factors, and writing for shortness

a—z, b—r, e—=x, d=ur, e=n, f—=xz=a, b, ce, d,e, f ; a&—=y=0;

a—y, by, c=y, d—=y, e=y, f—y=a,, b,, e,. d, e, t,;

and T remark that to avoid ambiguity the squares of these expressions are throughout,

1 written as (va)? and (ab)? respectively.
76. There is for the constant factors a like single-and-double-letter notation which
© will be mentioned presently, but in the first instance I nse for the even functions the
before mentioned 10 letters c, and for the odd ones six letters k. I assume that the
Qwvalues z, y==, © (ratio not determined) correspond to the values u=0, v=0 of the
arguments; and that w is a function of (a, y) which, when (z, y) are interchanged, changes

Sonly its 8ign, and which for indefinitely large values of (z, y) becomes = This
Sbeing 80, we write (adding a second column which will be afterwards explained)
