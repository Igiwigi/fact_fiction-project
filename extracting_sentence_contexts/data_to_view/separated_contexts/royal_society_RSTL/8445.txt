BLANFORD ON THE WINDS OF NORTHERN INDIA.

and 25th a north-east wind set in in Bengal and down the west of the Bay, displacing the
south-cast wind, which, however, continued to be felt in the immediate neighbourhood |
of the Nicobars; and the cyclone-vortex was formed by the indraught of these three
currents to the preexisting area of barometric depression. II. « The storm of the 13th to the 17th * May, 1869, originated near Cape Negrais on
the first of these days. A south-west breeze had been blowing pretty steadily over the
greater part of the Bay for 8ome days before, the mean direction being south-south-west
in the north of the Bay, south-west in the middle, and west-south-west in the south.”
Only * in the neighbourhood of the Andamans, Cape Negrais, and Rangoon a northerly
or north-westerly wind was felt occasionally during the ten days previous; but it was
unaccompanied by any fall of temperature, and would seem to have been a local deflection
of the south-west current.” © Some observations of pressure in the neighbourhood of
Cape Negrais would seem to indicate the existence of a slight barometric depression in
the Gulf of Martaban and to the west and north of Cape Negrais, but the instruments
were not sufficiently trustworthy to establish the fact in a satisfactory manner.”

IV. The storm of the 5th to the 10th JuneF of the same year was apparently formed
in the middle of the Bay, in about-16* north latitude. At Port Blair the wind had
been steady from south and south-west for two or three days; at Chittagong and Akyab
southerly, with alternations of land- and sea-breezes; at Saugor Island south ; at False
Point south-east, ; and a steamer crossing the head of the Bay from Calcutta to Akyab
had a steady south-east breeze.
