scientists shift the focus to entropy production and develop the MEPP. The historical evidence
suggests that this evolution will continue: our understanding of the relation of energy to evolution
will, itself, continue to evolve [28]. Lotka, Odum and Pinkerton were, for the most part, working
on their own; now there are a number of scientists in a number of different scientific disciplines
using the MEPP in the ‘thermodynamic school’ of evolution. We can see the influence of Lotka,
Odum and Pinkerton in this work, as well as the work that will come in the future. Many
contemporary scientists acknowledge this influence [24,27].

3. Ecology

Although the MPP helps us understand the relation between energy and fitness in the
evolutionary process, an important criticism has been raised about it: Hall writes that ‘Odum
never really tested it, and, in fact, he said on occasion that, like natural selection, it was extremely
difficult if not impossible to test it directly’ [29]. Some scientists that followed Odum have
attempted to address this challenge.

Nancy Harris, Charles Hall and Ariel Lugo, for example, did empirical surveys along an
elevational gradient in the Luquillo forest in Puerto Rico to test the MPP [30]. Hall writes:

‘We had hypothesized that ecosystems developed the most useful power (net
photosynthesis) at intermediate elevations. Gross photosynthesis was maximum at sea
level, but there respiration also would be maximum too due to high temperatures. At high
elevations photosynthesis is relatively low because of lower sunlight due to cloudiness, but
so is respiration because of lower temperature. We developed procedures for measuring
photosynthesis and respiration of a column of forest (including all species that were there)
