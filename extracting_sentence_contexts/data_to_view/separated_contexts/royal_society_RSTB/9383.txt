These alle-
gations are not groundless. Sophisticated comparative lawyers
have concluded that ‘inquisitorial’ systems of criminal pro-
cedure, which predominate outside Anglophone jurisdictions,
are culturally and ideologically more committed to truth-seek-
ing than adjudication organized on adversarial lines [59]. The
general worry is compounded in relation to expert evidence,
because science is expected to be the paradigm of objectivity
and factual rectitude and there are enhanced risks, relative to
lay witnesses of fact, that experts themselves might collude
with or be co-opted into adversarial partisanship. At this tipping-point in the discussion, we are in danger
of getting carried away with crude, stereotypical models of
adversarial procedure. Legal jurisdictions in reality vary
enormously in the extent and manner of their adversariness.
