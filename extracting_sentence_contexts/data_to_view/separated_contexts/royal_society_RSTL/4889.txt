Thirteenth, partial impregnation
of the ovum is of frequent, occurrence, as I found in my first experiments with fluid
that had passed through filtering-paper, but which till contained a very few sperma-
tozoa, either motionless or exceedingly feeble; and further, partial impregnation is of

much the most frequent occurrence when the ova are placed in dense fluid before
contact with the spermatozoa, as in the experiments with carmine. Lastly, when the
ova are only partially impregnated 'they are usually, and perhaps always unpro-
ductive. These facts lead us to inquire, whether impregnation takes place through any cata-
Iytic influence of the spermatozoa as suggested by BiscnorFe®, while in a state of
activity, and at the instant they are brought into contact with the ovum, or whether
impregnation results from a difluence of the spermatozoa thus brought into contact
with the surface, the substance into which they may be dissolved being carried by
endosmosis with the water imbibed through the tissues ; or whether it is the result

X of the conjoint influence of both these conditions ;—the first action induced being
8 instantaneous and catalytic, and possibly dependent on the persistence of organic
5 vitality in the spermatozoa, while the completion of the impregnation may depend on
- the imbibition of some material influence or substance derived from the impregnating
= body ;—a view which the gradual disappearance of the bodies of the spermatozoa
Hfrom the surface of the ovum, both in the Frog and Newt, seems to favour; as we
© have already seen that endosmosis is an active and important function of the enve-
:5 lopes of the oyum at the very period when impregnation is effected. ;Z All the experiments now detailed seem to show that in those vertebrata which
2 expel their ova into water before impregnation, as in the tail-less Amphibia, and in
Þ wheſobi=tbom the nature of the medium into which the ova are passed—we may
S infer that the function takes place most quickly, impregnation is commenced at
E the very instant of contact of the spermatozoon with the oyum, and even may be
= completed within very short spaces of time—but duration of at least some seconds
= of actual contact,—even in these animals* ova, is essential to the perfection of the
EZ function ;—but this period, we may fairly conclude, may differ in different classes of
E animals, and possibly may have some relation to the greater or less facility with which
i the spermatozoa are brought into contact with the ova.

V When the experiments last detailed are compared, —the effects produced by the ap-
= plication of media which influence the spermatozoon and the ovum chemically, —with
E those of which the effect is merely mechanical, we seem to have made some advance
towards a future knowledge of the nature of the impregnating power..
