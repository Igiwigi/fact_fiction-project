crystals of sulphate of soda from May 1832 to the present time, November 1833. If any part of the surface

were scratched or broken, then eflorescence began at that part, and covered the whole. The crystals wers
merely placed in evaporating basius and coyered with paper.


CONDITIONS OF NUCLEI, OF THE NASCENT STATE, ETC. 75

any other liquid or solid substance ; as, for instance, mercury or platina, if they were
made to replace the water, i. e. if the view of independent action which I have taken
(626. 627.) as a consequence of Darrox's principles be correct. It would also seem
that the mutual relation of similar particles, and the indifference of dissimilar particles
which Darrox has established as a matter of fact amongst gases and yapours, extends
to a certain degree amongst solids and fluids, that is, when they are in relation by
contact with vapours, either of their own substance or of other bodies. But though
I view these points as of great importance with respect to the relations existing be-
tween different substances and their physical constitution in the solid, liquid, or
gaseous state, T have not sufficiently considered them to venture any strong opinions
or statements here.

658. There are numerous well-known cases in which snbstances, such as oxygen
and hydrogen, act readily in their nascent state, and produce chemical changes which
they are not able to effect if once they have assumed the gaseous condition. Such
instances are very common at the poles of the voltaic pile, and are, I think, easily ac-
counted for, if it be considered that at the moment of separation of any such particle
