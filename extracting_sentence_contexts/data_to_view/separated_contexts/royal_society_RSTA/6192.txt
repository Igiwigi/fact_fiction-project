Such a theory would
identify abstract properties of proofs and trace the limits
of provability. A particular question of interest was ‘is
Author for correspondence: there a proof of a contradiction from a given set of axioms
T?’ or otherwise stated: ‘is T inconsistent?’ Hilbert’s
goal with Proof Theory was to show, via combinatorial
methods, that no mathematical proof could have a
contradiction as its conclusion. Gédel’s [1] incompleteness theorems showed that
Hilbert’s goal could not be attained in a. strict
sense: for sufficiently strong, consistent theories T, any
mathematical proof of the fact that T can only be
carried out in a mathematical theory T’ stronger than
T. In particular, Gédel’s theorems applied to theories
such as first-order and second-order arithmetic, i.e. PA
and Z».
