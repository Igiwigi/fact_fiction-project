Slow-cooled chills at 690°, 685°, 680°, 650° (not reproduced),

These are all very much alike; when ignited they are uniform, at all events to the
eye or a lens, but FeCl, brings out a number of rather small angular and interlacing
patches, which show the effect of varying brightness on tilting or rotation. A
moderate magnification makes it evident that each patch is broken up into narrow
bands with still narrower lines of a mother-substance between them. In fact, the sepa-
rations proper to the region below the transformation curve have taken place although
on a very small scale. This detail is not perceptibly larger in the chill at 650° than
in that at 690°, although a long period of slow cooling was allowed between the two
chills; hence we suspect that it occurred at lower temperatures during the chilling,
Fig. 63, a chill at 685° of Sn 24, gives a fair idea of these ingots. Sn 23.
