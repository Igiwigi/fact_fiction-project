Bloch (1980) himself admitted to an
uneasy feeling that this model of independent electrons, i.e. a model in which
electron—electron interactions are not considered, might represent a rather poor
approximation, even in the case of highly conducting free electrons in metals. Although widely accepted at the time, this criterion has since been proved to
be incomplete. In particular, it was recognized that there are classes of materials
which, if described according to Wilson’s (1931a,b) scheme, should be metallic
conductors but are in fact non-metals. Phil. Trans.
