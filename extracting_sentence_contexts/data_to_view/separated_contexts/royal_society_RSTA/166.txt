The results of
these calculations are presented in this paper. The particles are idealized as ellipsoidal in
order to make the mathematical treatment tractable. There is, in fact, no other form
offering a practical possibility of combining generality with numerical precision. Uniform
magnetization is in general possible only for bodies bounded by surfaces of the second degree. Only in that case can a demagnetization factor be uniquely defined, and the demagnetization
relations be given ina relatively simple form which is independent of the magnetic character-
istics of the material.
