The fact that young ovarian ova, of ;4g‚Äù in diameter, when the dots are first measured
how them to average about 24,000 to an inch linear, and ripe eggs five or six times
their diameter have 11,000 dots to an inch, thus but little more than doubling their size
gr distance apart, proves that during growth the number of these structural elements
T the yelk-sac must increase, as well as their size. This may be taken as an additional
of of interstitial growth.
S There is no evidence of the conversion of the substance of the outer layer of the pro-
lasm, 7. e. the cortex of the yelk, into yelk-sac, in the sense in which that gradual
@nversion is believed by Dr. Bears to take place in cartilage; at least after arrival
Ss that stage, and it is a very early one, at which the yelk-sac is separable: as then it
gays shows its inner and outer surfaces equally sharp, hard, and distinct.

Z There are no facts known to me to point out whether the pabulum for the growth of
is membrane is derived directly from the currents passing inwards, or from the mate-
Sil elaborated in the egg and passing out of it, or from both sources indifferently.

Z The extreme delicacy of the film which covers the yelk at first, makes it impossible to
gy positively whether it appertains rather to the layer of cells lining the ovisac, or
ether it is more closely adherent to the yelk ; but 1 incline to the latter view.
SThe germinal vesicle, which, both from the facts here recorded, and from the analogy
# the eggs of invertebrata, appears to be formed before the primitive yelk, may be
Spposec, from its disappearing when the egg is ripe, before fecundation, or the action
external agents, to preside over the origin and growth of the egg. However, the
Txition in which it is last seen with respect to the micropyle, as strongly indicates that
iS remnants have some important relation to the act of fecundation.
