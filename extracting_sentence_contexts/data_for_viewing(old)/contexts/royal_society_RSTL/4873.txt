The passage of the glacier through a gorge or contraction is explained on the same
view by figure. 2, where the resistance of the sides having occasioned a series of
parallel longitudinal rents as before, the portion of the glacier beyond the limits of
breadth of the gorge BB' is supposed to be detained or embayed whilst the interme-
diate columns slip through.

Q 5. Experiments at Chamouni on the Plasticity of Ice.

It bas been shown that in order to: reconcile Ds SaussuR's theory of sliding mo-
tion with the ascertained fact that the centre of the glacier moyes faster than the
sides, it had been assumed- that solutions of continuity or longitudinal erevasses
were formed parallel to the length of the glacier, by means of which the central por-
tion slides, past that adjacent to it, and 80, on for successive strips as we approach the
sides, the more rapid retardation near the sides being rendered mechanically possible
by the increased number of these longitudinal dislocations.

The result was therefore predicted to be that the glacier would be found to move
by echelons, or that trips of -ice of a.certain number of feet, or yards, or fathoms,
would move either suddenly or by gradual sliding, but at all events 80 as to mark by
an abrupt separation at the longitudinal fissure, that the one portion of ice has slipped
past the other by a distinet measurable quantity,
