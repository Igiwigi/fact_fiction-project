Many of the details of the reproductive organs in both
sexes are peculiar and, as far as present knowledge goes, unique; the physiological state of
these structures throws some light on the breeding activities of the fish. In this paper
a systematic account is given first of the macroscopic anatomy and then of the microscopic
anatomy and histology of the urinogenital structures. This is followed by a discussion of the
findings in comparison with the facts recorded in the literature about other elasmobranch
fishes, and by some tentative conclusions on the breeding and life history of the species. Basking sharks reach a great size, being exceeded in bulk by only one other fish, the
Whale shark (Rhineodon) of tropical seas. The maximum length, measured in a straight line,
is about 29 ft., and the weight about 4 tons.
