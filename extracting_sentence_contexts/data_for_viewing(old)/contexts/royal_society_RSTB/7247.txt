thin with moderately close meshes, in which silken threads are quite distinct. Those formed
at 90% r.u. are hard, having dense wall with meshes very close, so as to give a papery
appearance; they do not differ statistically in dimensions from those formed at 80% R.H.

The cocoons spun at 94-8, 97-5 and 100% Rr.H. have a thick, compact, papery wall com-

posed of a large quantity of webbing, and are comparatively large.* Apparently, the
thickness of the cocoon wall depends on the state of the metabolic activities of the larva.
This is also borne out by the fact that at 80% R.H. with 35° C the cocoons of X. brasiliensis
had loose meshes, whilst those of X. astia had moderately close meshes, as the larval
activity was less in the former species than in the latter at this temperature, which is very
near the upper fatal limit of X. brasiliensis (see p. 625). Even the cocoons of X. cheopis formed
at 90% r.u. with 35° C had meshes closer than those of X. brasiliensis, and those of X. astia
had a thick papery lining.

On the whole, the cocoons of X. astia (table 2) were statistically the biggest and those of
X. brasiliensis the smallest, when spun at the same humidity. The cocoons of X. brasiliensis
were more or less spherical, and those of the other two species were elongated oval.

As regards the mode of cocoon formation in fleas, I (Sharif 1937, p. 230) differed from
Bacot (1914, p. 473). Actually the flea larva first secretes a few silken threads which are
