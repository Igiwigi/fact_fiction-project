polarity, the phenomena of hysteresis and other prominent characteristics of the
magnetizing process follow as consequences of the control which the molecular magnets
exert on one another by their polar forces. Thus, in the application of magnetic force
_ to an unmagnetized piece, the molecular magnets are at first deflected stably, and in
this stage there is no hysteresis. But when the force is sufficiently increased certain
molecules are deflected so far as to become unstable, and a breaking up and re-
arrangement of molecular groups supervenes. Finally, after this process has occurred
throughout the piece a third stage is entered on, when further stable deflections
through a small range bring about the completely “saturated” state. Hysteresis is
found whenever any of the molecules pass from one stable configuration to another
through a phase of instability, and this transition, being mechanically irreversible,
involves a dissipation of energy. It was shown that this conception of molecular
structure gave an explanation of very many known facts regarding the magnetic
quality of iron and steel, and that some of these may be effectively illustrated by
means of a model consisting of a group of small magnets pivotted like compass needles
on fixed centres, and placed near enough to one another to allow their mutual polar
forces to be strongly felt.

Th further elucidation of this theory, we have made a number of experiments with
such a model. In some of them as many as 130 little magnets have been used. These
were cut out of sheet steel. They were mostly lozenge-shaped, and were about an
inch long and half an inch wide, but some were smaller; each had a central recess
punched in it to form a socket for the supporting pivot, which was an inverted
drawing-pin with a sharp point. The pins were stuck through a sheet of paper to
hold them at the desired distance apart, and the paper was laid on a horizontal
