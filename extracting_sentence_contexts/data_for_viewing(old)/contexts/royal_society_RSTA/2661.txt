to the hodoscope.

The Slaves are built around an ESIROC [6] chip developed by LAL specifically for use with
SiPMs, while the Master uses a custom-programmed FPGA coupled to a stand-alone RASBERRY
micro-controller. The power budget of the whole system is roughly 3 W per Slave and 5 W for the
Master.

Each SiPM hybrid is serviced by one Slave and the electrical connections between the two are
made with micro-ribbon coaxial cables. Each Slave provides biasing of the SiPMs, amplification,
discrimination and ADC conversion of the signals. The slaves are daisy-chained and read-out by
the Master. The maximum sustainable trigger frequency is ~1 KHz. This set-up was developed
specifically for our first prototype (MU-RAY), and apart from minor improvements, has not been
changed for the MURAVES project. In fact, we have already produced and tested 48 Slave boards
(plus spares) for the Vesuvius hodoscopes and the Master boards.

In addition, there is a Slow Control Unit that takes care of temperature and humidity readings.
This unit also drives a highly efficient Peltier cooling system developed by us (figure 8) that allows
us to operate the hodoscopes even during the hottest days by keeping the SiPM temperatures
at manageable levels. For this purpose, our SiPM hybrid has many thermal vias that connect
