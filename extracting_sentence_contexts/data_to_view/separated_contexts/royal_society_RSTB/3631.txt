Of the former group there were six experi-
ments and of the latter four. In all the primary anastomoses the wound healed by
first intention, but in the secondary anastomoses failure of primary union occurred
in three. These failures of primary union were probably due to the fact that the
animals, after so much confinement as occurs before the second operation takes place,
are not in so healthy a condition as when first brought to the laboratory. In this
respect I have found monkeys more satisfactory than dogs, as I have never seen in a
monkey failure of primary union. (1) Primary Anastomosis Experiments Compared.
