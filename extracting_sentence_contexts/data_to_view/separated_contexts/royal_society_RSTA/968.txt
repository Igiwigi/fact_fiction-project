For
instance, suppose that we know that a certain object—say, an integer z, or a matrix A—is a
symplectic invariant of (M,o,f1,...,fn). Can we compute this object from the semiclassical joint
spectrum? An additional interesting problem, which is in fact closely related to question 2.5 is as follows. Problem 7.9 (A. Pelayo).
