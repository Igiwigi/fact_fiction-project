With decreasing temperature, however, the two curves
approach one another and coincide at approximately 1° C. below the critical
temperature. These results are in accord with the results of similar experiments on
propylene and methy] ether obtained in this laboratory. That the values obtained
on curve A are reproducible was shown by the fact that readings taken several
times, between which the medium had been cooled to a temperature less than 1° C.
below the critical, were found to be identical. The same reproducibility was found
for curve B each time the medium was cooled from a temperature 5° C. above the
critical. The data in Table V were obtained when the volume was adjusted so that the
meniscus was always below the float as long as it was visible.
