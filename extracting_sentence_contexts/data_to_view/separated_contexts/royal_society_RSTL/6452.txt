zontal component of the earth's magnetism bears always a nearly invariable proportion
to its effect upon the vertical component of the same. In this cage it is clear that two
or more disturbing forces superimposed would, as far as regards the horizontal and vertical-
force changes, behave almost in the same manner as a pure elementary disturbance, This
als explains why it is almost impossible to find a peak in the one component of the force
corresponding to a hollow in the other.
