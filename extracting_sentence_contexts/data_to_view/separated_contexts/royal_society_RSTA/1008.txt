Furthermore, some substances, such as cyclo-
hexane, which give rise to large amounts of NOg,, do not readily knock. The fact
that the amount of nitrogen peroxide formed increases with the intensity of ‘* knock,”
however, indicates that the same causes which produce the nitrogen peroxide also
produce the conditions necessary for ‘“‘knock”’ tooccur. There is, in fact, evidence that
the two processes are very closely interconnected, for the addition of acetyl peroxide
induces NO, formation at a very early stage in the stroke. If the NO, is formed by
catalysis at the surface of the valves, the experiments suggest that the amount also
depends on active products from other reactions which are taking place there, and
particularly those reactions connected with formation and decomposition of those
substances present when “ knock ”’ occurs. 6G—EstTImMATION OF ALDEHYDES

During the tests described in § 1, the concentrations of aldehydes were also deter-
mined in most cases.
