During the year of my stay there were not many exceptionally fine auroras, and
coloured auroras were very rare. From the one or two I did see the colours appeared
to be of two distinct kinds (by colours in this connection I mean colours other than
the greenish-white light of the ordinary aurora). ‘There is first the mass of coloured

light which retains its form and colour for a comparatively long time, and colours
which flash out and disappear immediately. A very interesting fact struck me with
regard to the latter class of colour. It is generally known that an aurora arch is
often composed of a series of spear-like shafts of light arranged perpendicularly to the
direction of the arch, and which appear to be in constant motion. A number of these
spears will suddenly become brilliant and the lower ends shoot out of the arch into
the black sky below. The brillianey will then run along the arch like a wave of
light, lighting up all the spears as it goes along, I noticed that the “ front” of such
a wave of brilliancy and the points of the spears when shooting out were bright red,
but as soon as the motion stopped the colour disappeared, while the more violent the
motion the purer and brighter the red. It appeared as if some physical process
accompanied the passage of the aurora beam through the air and gave out a red
light. For example, if the air had to be ionized before the discharge could pass
through, then the process of ionization produced red light. If the motion was
