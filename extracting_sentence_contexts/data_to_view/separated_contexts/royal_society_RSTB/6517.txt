H. H. GREEN ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND

In the lower teeth a possible theoretical resemblance to the typical tuberculosectorial
arrangement can be made out if it can be supposed (a) that the smaller cusps are in
fact more or less constant, and (b) that these cusps originally possessed a greater
significance than they do now. The main cusps would be the protoconid and the
hypoconid. However, these homologies are extremely unlikely ; the early ontogenetic appearance
of the hypocone (and indeed its appearance at all in such a primitive form), and the
reduction to such a degree of the paracone and metacone, make a derivation from the
tuberculosectorial type very improbable.
