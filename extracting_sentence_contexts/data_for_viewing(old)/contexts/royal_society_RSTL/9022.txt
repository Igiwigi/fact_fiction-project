In this inquiry, thus far, I have confined my observations to purely liquid infusions,
purposely excluding milk, mixtures of turnip-juice and cheese, and, indeed, mixtures of

something * particulate * which sets up all the train of changes in an open wound, which may, after the patient
has passed through a period of more or less constitutional disturbance, end in the healing of the wound, or may
end in septicemia and death. This particulate material, then, TI believe we have evidence enough to prove

say that I entirely agree with Mr. Tmorxrox in the distinction he draws between germs and developed Bacteria
floating in the air. Tt is, in my opinion, of the yery last importance to seize this distinetion with clearness.
When it is fully realized we 8hall probably hear less of the arguments against Bacterial contagia founded
on the fact that a virus diminishes in strength as the Bacteria multiply. A portion of the energy of tho virus

these and kindred subjects; and to it I also postpone . the complete examination of
pepton, and of the remarkable experiments described by Dr. WiLL1ax Ropers, a mall
residue of which only I have failed to corroborate.

Throughout the whole of this investigation I have had to congratulate myself on the
zealous and efficient aid of my excellent assistant, Mr. Joux Corraets. His intelligence
