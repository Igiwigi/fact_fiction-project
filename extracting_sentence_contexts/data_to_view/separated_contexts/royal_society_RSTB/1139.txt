We have tried the experiment several times without —
success. As far as they go, the results of the second experiment would seem to
indicate that the lateral column effect is not present when only one channel of
influence, that of the 7th lumbar posterior root, is present, and this result is in
accordance with the observations made upon the posterior root itself. It is not
impossible that the results of the first experiments with the sciatic nerve given in
Section 3, in which an effect was always obtained from the lateral column of the same
side, are due to the fact that the nerve investigated was left in connection with the
cord by fibres emerging from at least three posterior roots, beside the 7th lumbar,
but as we have not been able to carry the investigation of this point further at
present, we would merely emphasize the fact that the anatomical connections with
the cord were different in the two cases.

(3.) Summary of the Facts in (1) and (2). If now we sum up the results of all these experiments when the nerve investigated
is connected with the cord by afferent tracts only, we find that the average effect
evoked by excitation of the posterior column of the same side
