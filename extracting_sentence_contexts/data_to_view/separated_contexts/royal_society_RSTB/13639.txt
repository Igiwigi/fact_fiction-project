He was
active in a public outreach group Science for the People. He
repeated the results, for instance in his 1974 book The Genetic
Basis of Evolutionary Change (Richard C. [92]), in a 1982 book
titled Human Diversity that was part of the public-facing
Scientific American Library Series [88], and in his book Not
in Our Genes [34]. However, beyond Lewontin and the 1972 paper, the
empirical fact of the 85%/15% split in diversity within
versus between populations grew a life of its own and was
amplified in numerous ways. This was in part facilitated, as

remarked above, because many other population genetics
researchers found similar results, which had the effect of
amplifying knowledge of the apportionment of diversity. The highly influential 1981 book The Mismeasure of Man by
Lewontinâ€™s Harvard colleague Stephen J.
