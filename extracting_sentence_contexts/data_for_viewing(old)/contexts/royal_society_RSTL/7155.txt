the breadth of the lit as observed without the interposed prisms, are either superposed,
or touch one another, or are separated. by a black space. In making use of the two
prisms, we generally regulated the aperture of the slit 80 that the two small sodium-
bands appeared separated by a black space having nearly the breadth of these bands.
In this case the angle at which the aperture of the slit is seen is equal to half the angu-
lar distance of the two middle lines of the bands, and therefore equal to half the angu-
lar distance of the two sodium-bands themselves after being reduced by narrowing the
slit to mathematical lines.

If the images touch each other, the aperture of the slit and the two sodium-lines are
seen at the same angle.

14. The first fact which we discoyered in operating with our tubes, guided by the
above explained principles, was the following one :—

There is @ certain number of elementary subsfances, which, when differently heated, fur-
nish two kinds of spectra of quite a different character, not having any line or any band
in common.

The fact is important, as well with regard to theoretical conceptions as to practical
applications—the more s0 as the passage from one kind of spectra to the other is by no
means a continuous one, but takes place abruptly. By regulating the temperature you
may repeat the two spectra in any succession ad libitum.

We will now treat more explicitly the case of Nitrogen, which first unfolded to us its
