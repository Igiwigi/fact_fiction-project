Nucleus lateralis—The lateral nucleus of the thalamus consists of two quite distinct
elements La and Lb. The former is particularly well defined, being circumscribed
by a medullary capsule. In none of our experiments was any cell degeneration
detected in this element, though in experiment F there was noted a slight degree of
gliosis in its outer margin. We may conclude, therefore, that element La either
has no cortical connections with the frontal and parietal lobes at all, or, if they are
present, they must be very few and scattered.

Element Zé lies at the dorsal surface of the thalamus and can with difficulty be
differentiated morphologically from the subjacent ventral nucleus (pars externa).
However, it is distinguished from the latter by certain features of its cytoarchitecture
and by the fact that fillet fibres have not hitherto been traced into it. In all our
experiments in which the cortical lesion in the parietal lobe has been confined to the
area post-centralis (experiments A, B, C, and D), cell degeneration has been limited
to the pars externa of the ventral nucleus. On the other hand, in experiment E,
in which the lesion involved the post-central area and portions of areas 5 and 7,
cell atrophy was found in the pars externa of the ventral nucleus and also in the
caudal half of nucleus Lb. Further, in experiments F, G, and H, in which the
cortical lesions lay behind the area post-centralis, cell degeneration was found in
nucleus Lb while the ventral nucleus remained intact. These experiments show
that the post-sensory areas of the parietal lobe (by which we understand all that part
of the parietal cortex lying caudal to the area post-centralis, and including
BropMANN’s areas 5, 7, 18 and 19) receive fibres from the caudal half of element Ld.
Moreover, these corticipetal connections of Lb are most abundant at its caudal
