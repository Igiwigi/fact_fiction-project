This does not occur off Brixham ; but traces of it were found a short way up the valley ®

The entrance of the cave, which is on the line of a north and south joint (PI t
XLL. F, fig. 1), was calculated by Mr. Br1srow trigonometricallyF to be 93 feet abo
high-water mark ; whilst Mr. Bovey made it 94 feet 11 inches by levelling, or about
66 feet above the level of the stream in the valley in front of the cave. It is therefor
rather more than halfway to the top of the hill, the slope of which is without, steep
escarpments, but with a terrace at the level of 150 feet (Plate XLI. fig. 2+).

The work of exploration was completed in the swmmer of 1859, the cave having been
then emptied 80 far as it could be followed, although Mr. PExXGELLY observes ©
galleries certainly extend beyond the point reached .by the workmen.” It is probable
that the hill is in fact traversed by a number of such fissures.

Respecting the manner in which the exploration was conducted, Mr. PENGELLY
remarks :—* It was decided first to remove the stalagmitic floor, then the entire bed imme-
diately below (if not of inconvenient depth) horizontally throughout the length of the
cavern, or 80 far as practicable; this accomplished, to proceed similarly with the next
lower bed, and 80 on until all the deposits had been removed.

* The more effectually to guard against the chance of error, the materials were first
carefully examined #7 situ, after which they were taken at once outside the cavern, where
they underwent a further inspection. In no instance were they remoyed, for even tempo-
rary convenience, from one part of the cavern to another.
