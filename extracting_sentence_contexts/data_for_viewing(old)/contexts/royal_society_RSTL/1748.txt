I haye examined all the steps of each experiment, and of the computations connected therewith ; but
cannot detect any source of error. In fact, it is one of those perplexing anomalies which occasionally
occur in our researches after such minute quantities.

* I cannot trace the exact law of the variations in the three values in the column, indicating the
weight of adhesive air dragged by each rod ; but the nearest approximation is, that the numbers are
nearly in the ratio of the square root of the cubes of their diameters,

of this paper ; to which I added a third, 3 inches in diameter, weighing 29114
grains, and whose specific gravity I found to be 8:020. The ends of
the brass and steel rods were screwed into the sevyeral spheres : but
