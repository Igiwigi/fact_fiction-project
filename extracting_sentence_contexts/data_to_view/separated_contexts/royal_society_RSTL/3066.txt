Its comprehension is 80
important, that I think we cannot proceed much further in the investigation of the
laws of electricity without a more thorough understanding of its nature ; how other-
wise can we hope to comprehend the harmony and even unity of action which doubtless
governs electrical excitement by friction, by chemical means, by heat, by magnetic
influence, by evaporation, and even by the living being ?

1163. In the long-continued course of experimental inquiry in which I have been
engaged, this general result has pressed upon me constantly, namely, the necessity
of admitting two forces, or two forims or directions of a force (516. 517.), combined
with the impossibility of separating these two forces (or electricities) from each other,
either in the phenomena of statical electricity or those of the current. In ass0-
ciation with this, the impossibility under any circumstances, as yet, of absolutely
charging matter of any kind with one or the other electricity dwelt on my mind, and
made me wish and search for a clearer view than any that I was acquainted with, of
the way in which electrical powers and the particles of matter are related; especially
in inductive actions, upon which almost all others appeared to rest.

1164, When I discovered the general fact that electrolytes refused to yield their
elements to a current when in the solid state, though they gave them forth freely if in
the liquid condition (380, 394. 402.), I thought I saw an opening to the elucidation of
inductive action, and the possible subjugation of many dissimilar phenomena to one
law. For let the electrolyte be water, a plate of ice being coated with platina foil
on its two surfaces, and these coatings connected with any continued source of the
two electrical powers, the ice will charge like a Leyden arrangement, presenting a
case of common induction, but no current will pass. If the ice be liquified, the in-
duction will fall to a certain degree, because a current can now pass; but its passing
is dependent upon a peculiar molecular arrangement of the particles consistent with
the transfer of the elements of the electrolyte in opposite directions, the degree of
discharge and the quantity of elements eyolyed being exactly proportioned to each
other (377.783.).
