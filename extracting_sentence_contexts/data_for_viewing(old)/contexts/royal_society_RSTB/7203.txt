scale and with its ‘stalk’ freely projecting. As Kiihn observes, however, the ‘stalk’ ‘ist doch
nie so scharf vom Schuppenkérper abgesetzt und quer abgestuzt wie ein normaler Schuppen-
stiel’. This type he contrasts with a third (which occurs with increasing frequency as heat
stimulation is postponed to a later stage in development) in which a scale-like process
emerges from the scale in normal orientation, that is, attached to the parent scale by its
narrow end,

I am inclined to regard these types not as indicating reversal in polarity, but as types of
disturbance of the ratio ob vole a

The fact that, in scales, flattening always follows dilatation of an originally cylindrical
rudiment to a club, suggests that the sudden change in shape of the cross-section of the
scale is due to the fact that the rudiment with a circular cross-section becomes mechanically
unstable when its diameter exceeds a certain limiting value. It is possible that the scale
collapses like a thin-walled cone in which, at the base, the ratio of diameter to wall
thickness has exceeded a limiting value determined by the stiffness of the material. The
collapse of the scale, however, can scarcely be under its own weight. It is observed that the
scale rudiments are always applied to the wing-surface, and it is suggested that there is
a tendency for the scale to adhere to this surface (figures 16, 19, 22, 25, plate 1); flattening
in the plane of the surface may follow as a consequence of this adhesion when the diameter
of the rudiment exceeds a limit set by the stiffness of the surface membrane.

A further possibility is that the increase in perimeter and the intercalation of new ridges
