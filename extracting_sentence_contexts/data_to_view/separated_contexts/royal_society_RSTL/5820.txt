Z The botryoidal vascular appendage (fig. 5, 9g g) exhibits the same character. The
£tubal portion (5 e) is only more densely coiled and complicated. 'The umbrella-shaped
Zextremity is very large, and the cilia act with great force. Neither HerNG, DE QUaTRE-
Spacns, nor GEGENBAUER allude anywhere in their writings to the fact, which is 80 signi-
Eficant i in a homological sense, of the increased size of the ciliated tubes of the generative
ſegments in Lumbricus. SZ Before proceeding to investigate the contents of the second (from behind forwards)
Soenerative ring, it is material that the dissector should convince himself that in the first
Zring nothing connected with the reproductive organs is contained but the testes and the
Qciliated tubes Jjust described. No ducts crossing the space can be discovered, no ovaries
or sacculi of any description.
