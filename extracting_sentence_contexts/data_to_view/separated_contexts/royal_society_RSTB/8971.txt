This
electrophysiological definition of synaptic NMDARs may
encapsulate receptors located not only at synapses but also at
peri- or extrasynaptic locations that possibly contribute, even
mildly, to low-frequency synaptic transmission. Because it is dif-
ficult to determine to what extent glutamate spills over during
basal synaptic transmission, it is unclear to what degree
the morphological and electrophysiological definition of the
synaptic and extrasynaptic spaces overlap. In fact, the precise
delineation of the synapticâ€”extrasynaptic frontier seems specific
to the parameter that one considers, and it is likely that an
all-encompassing definition of this boundary cannot be found. It is generally believed that extrasynaptic NMDARs are
enriched in GluN2B-containing heterodimers (GluN2B-
NMDARs). This would fit with the idea that extrasynaptic
NMDARs constitute a distinct population, serving a specific
function.
