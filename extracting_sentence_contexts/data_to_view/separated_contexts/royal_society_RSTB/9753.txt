A statistically significant sex difference does not neces-
sarily indicate a meaningful separation between the sexes. Figure 3 shows hypothetical data for a fictional drug I will
call ‘Dimorphinil’. In this fictive sample of 40 men and 40
women, the sex difference in clearance rate is both significant
(p <0.01) and of medium size (d= 0.60). The effect size
exceeds that for some real drugs, for example, cyclosporine
and nifedipine, for which clearance rate differs significantly
between the sexes [77,78]. The low p-value and medium
effect size for Dimorphinil suggest non-trivial, clinically rel-
evant sex difference [79].
