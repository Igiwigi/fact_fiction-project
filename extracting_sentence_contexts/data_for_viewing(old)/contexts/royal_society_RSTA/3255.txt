By contrast, figure 3b starts from a bare action with parameters adjusted such that the bare
potential exhibits a kink (at ¢ ~ 4 x 10° GeV in this example). This bare potential still has only one
minimum at ¢ = 0, but in combination with the contributions from the top-fluctuations (fermion
determinant), the effective potential exhibits two minima, one near the kink position seeded in
the bare action and the second one being the Fermi minimum by construction (again not well
visible on this scale). We conclude that metastabilities can, of course, occur in the Higgs sector
also in the class of consistent bare actions [45]. The important point is that this metastability of the
Fermi minimum by a second deeper minimum at large fields has to be seeded by corresponding
structures in the bare action. The latter would have to be provided by the underlying theory.

While the mean-field approximation is capable of illustrating these stability /metastability
features rather well, it does not establish convexity as is obvious from figure 3b. In fact, from
the definition of the effective action as a Legendre transform, convexity is a built-in property
of the effective potential, which is respected neither at the mean-field level nor in conventional
perturbation theory. It is thus a natural question as to whether the convexity property of the
potential has any decisive influence on the picture developed so far?

As a powerful feature, the structure of the Wetterich equation (3.2) does establish convexity
of the potential for its global solutions [46]. We have analysed this approach to convexity-
quantitatively in the present model in [45]. Our results demonstrate that the convexity generating
mechanisms set in in the deep infrared below the scale where the top quark decouples and the
Fermi minimum forms. For all cases studied in [45], there is a clear separation between the regime
