These relations are clearly shown in
figs. 54 and 61. Fig. 54 also shows that the left habenular ganglion is of a somewhat
different shape from the right one, being gradually drawn out upwards into the wall
of the dorsal sac. This difference appears to be constant, for I have observed it in
all of my three series of transverse sections (Sphenodon I, III, VI), and it is
associated with the fact that at this point a specially strongly developed bundle of
nerve-fibres (n. p. e.), doubtless from the pineal eye, enters the ganglion from the
wall of the dorsal sac, as also shown in the longitudinal section represented in fig. 61. The right and left habenular ganglia meet together posteriorly in a median portion
which lies above the superior commissure (figs.
