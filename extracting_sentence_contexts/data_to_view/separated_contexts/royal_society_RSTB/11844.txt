We found that the fitness of the
pho84/trk1 double mutant (0.015 + 0.001 s.e.) was higher
than the expectation based on the sum of fitnesses of single
mutants (0.013 + 0.001 s.e., figure 2), although the difference

Next, we compared the mutual information statistic MI;
for each gene pair (i,j) in the dataset to its respective null dis-
tribution (see Methods; electronic supplementary material,
figure $3). We identified a significant genetic interaction
between two genes if the p-value for their MI was less
than 0.003. At this cut-off, we expect to observe 18.8 interact-
ing gene pairs under our null model, but in fact we observe

expected to exhibit allele specificity.
