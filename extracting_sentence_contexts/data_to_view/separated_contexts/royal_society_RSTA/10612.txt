It is now very generally agreed that the deflectable Becquerel rays consist of a
stream of negative ions proceeding from the radio-active body with enormous
velocities (BEcQUEREL, ‘Comptes Rendus,’ vol. 130, p. 109). But this theory gives
no account of the nature of the other variety of Becquerel rays. I wish to make
some mention of a possible solution of the question, indicating how far it appears to
fall into line with the known facts. Let us, then, imagine that the absorbable rays consist of a stream of positive ions
moving from the radio-active body. Now we know that the positive ions in gases carry the same charge as the
negative, and that they have an enormously greater mass (J.
