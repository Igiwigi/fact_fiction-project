show the intimate structure of sjeve-tubes. In the course of my investigations on
pulvini I had frequent opportunities for ebserving sieve-tubes, e.g., in Mimosa,
Robinia, &e. In both the above-named cases the sieve-tubes are very small, but
treatment with sulphurie acid, and subsequent staining with methyl violet and
glycerine, or HOFMANN's blue, brought out these structures very successfully, and
defined in an extremely clear manner the very fine threads connecting the contents of
neighbouring tubes. The sieve-tubes of Dahlia variabilis, Ricinus communis, and
Phaseolus multiflorus were also investigated. In Ricinus the youngest sieve-cells
where perforation had not yet taken place were clearly demonstrated. In Phaseolus
the general occurrence of a lenticular highly refractive body in the sieve-tube cavity
was noticed, but I must defer a description of it until a future occasion.

But in the end the fact became apparent that although the results obtained with
sleve-tubes gave very valuable proof of the snecess of the method I had adopted, yet
that their structure could not be exactly compared to that of the parenchymatous
cells of pulvini. Thus, in sieve-tubes, the cell-walls tend to assume a 8oft and 8ome-
what mucilaginous character, and in them the middle lamella is but little developed,
and the whole wall readily dissolves in sulphuric acid.

In the cells of the pulvinus, on the other hand, the walls greatly resist the action
of the acid, and the development of the middle lamella is essentially pronounced.

There was, however, still one road left open, and that was to investigate the
structure of thickened endosperm cells where all the requisite conditions were present,
and what was of greater importance still, where the pit membrane was extremely
