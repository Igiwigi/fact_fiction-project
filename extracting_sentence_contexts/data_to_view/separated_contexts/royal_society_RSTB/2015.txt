In this
way WissELINGH has shown chitin to be present in. Myxomycetes, Phycomycetes, and
numbers of other fungi, including some members of the Ustilagineze, but he did not
find it in any of the Bacteria which he investigated. When applied to sections of Leguminous nodules this method gave no trace of pink
colour ; we may, therefore, probably conclude that chitin does not enter into the com-
position of the matrix of these tubes—a fact which supplies additional evidence
against the theory that the organism should be classed with the Ustilaginez. All I am able to offer concerning the matrix enclosing these rodlets is, therefore, of
a negative character—that it contains nothing of the nature of cellulose or chitin, nor
probably of mucilage. The staining of the tube in the root-hair I found to be a very difficult matter, owing
to the collapse of the hairs when the roots are transferred from one liquid to another,
