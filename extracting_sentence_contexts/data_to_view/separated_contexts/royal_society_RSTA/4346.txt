Recently, a silicon photonic chip-based two-dimensional MEMS switch was demonstrated
that can support microsecond switching times [44]. These MEMS switches operate at low power
levels. In fact, the two-dimensional switch can be latched so that almost no power is used
while the switch is in position. Microsecond speed control is low speed from a processing
perspective and therefore very energy efficient. The challenge is in identifying the elephants
and efficiently scheduling the optical circuits through these switches.
