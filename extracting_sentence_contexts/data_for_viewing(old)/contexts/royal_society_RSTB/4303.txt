of about the same thickness, which is very much less than that of the completed
enamel, This has a strong bearing on the mode of its development, to which I shall
presently refer. Sections of these enamel caps stain throughout, and exhibit the
same complicated pattern described in the prisms of the completed tooth near the
dentine.

From these appearances, I think, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the
tubes have a calcifying function, conveying the lime salts to the organic foundation
substance of the enamel, The stained spaces in the unerupted tooth are enormously
wider than the largest tubes of the enamel; they must be, therefore, spaces of
incomplete calcification into which these tubes lead. The explanation of these
appearances is, I think, to be found in the different stages of development seen in the
enamel organ of these fish, and to the fact that the pellicle of the enamel organ,
which, as I shall presently show, has in its later stages a free supply of blood-vessels,
remains attached to the surface of the enamel until it is actually fully erupted and
in wear,

Development of Enamel in Sargus.

Mr. C. Tomes (14) showed that, in the Gadidee, and, as he says, probably in other
osseous fish, there is a very marked difference in the mode of development of the
enamel from that found in mammalian enamel organs.

The enamel organ is at first similar in appearance to that of the Mammalia,
although showing no stellate reticulum or stratum intermedium, but the amelobasts
