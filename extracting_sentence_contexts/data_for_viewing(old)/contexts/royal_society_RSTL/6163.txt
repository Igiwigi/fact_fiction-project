'order, in wood which is taking up water. It does not immediately assume the length
due to the state of hygrometry, but if heated the set is taken out, and the wood expands
to its proper length.

77. Tnasmuch as at a certain degree of humidity wood contracts in every direction
with a rise of temperature, it might be inferred that on weighing it in water its specific
gravity would be found to increase on the elevation of temperature. Such, however, is
not the fact. A piece of saturated wood, being part of the specimen employed in the
last series of experiments, was found to weigh 392-6 grs. in air, 42-26 grs. in distilled
water at 0?, and 42:01 grs. in distilled water at 8*. Hence the cubical expansion was
0000892 per degree, but calculated on the wood considered apart from the water in its

Pores, -000396. Therefore on raising the temperature a decrease of specific gravity
Sccurs simultaneously with a diminution in the external dimensions of the wood. 'This
an only take place in consequence of a contraction of the surfaces of the walls of the
=ellular structure, while the actual bulk of the material of which they are composed is
1creased, a certain minute quantity of water exuding at the same time.
S, 78. The phenomenon in question is therefore, I believe, owing to capillary attrac-
ions, which, diminishing with elevation of temperature, has the effect of yang a
.Sart of the 8welled condition due to that action. Dr. YouxG has given 3; as the
