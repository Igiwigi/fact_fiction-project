But when « = «P/T®*, by
(60’) w increases as P, decreases ; by (59’), Py decreases as y decreases ; and thus p
increases as g decreases. The fundamental difference between « = constant and
x = aP/T®2 is that in the former case the total “ mass above the photosphere ”’ is
independent of g and therefore the same for giants and dwarfs, but in the latter case the
total “‘ mass above the photosphere ” increases, at constant T, as we pass from dwarfs
to giants. The observed fact is that all lines are strengthened from dwarfs to giants. We cannot
immediately hail this as evidence in favour of the law « % P, for the decrease of Py
