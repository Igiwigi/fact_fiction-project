Similarly to figure 1, figures 7 and 8 report both the incrementally deformed grid and the
corresponding incrementally deformed effective material (shown in orange). From both figures,
the following conclusions can be drawn:

(i) The bending moments applied at the ends of the rods correspond to a null mean stress
and therefore do not provide any effect on the boundary of the effective material. In fact,
this effect is a higher-order contribution within the homogenization scheme adopted here,
so that it could be highlighted only in a higher-order description employing Cosserat or
Mindlin continua for the effective material.

(ii) At loss of PD, the effective material admits incremental deformations corresponding to
zero second-order energy. For these deformations (addressed in the figures), an element
of the effective material is subject to an incremental strain with null surface tractions.


(b)

8 loss of PD

Figure 8. As for figure 7, except that the prestress states are tensile and biaxial, located on a line inclined at 30Â° with respect
to p,-axis and that the superimposed deformation is an incremental deformation L = 0.866025 e, @ e) + 0.5 e) @ ej. (a)
The prestress is well inside the SE domain, p ~ {3.53705, 2.04212}. (b) The prestress state is on the PD boundary, p,, ~
{7.07411, 4.08424}, now inside the SE boundary, and the reported incremental deformation represents the corresponding
zero-energy mode for the effective material. (Online version in colour.)

In this case, the grid of rods deforms only under incremental bending moments, which,
although contributing to the local equilibrium of the lattice, do not appear on the effective
continuum.
