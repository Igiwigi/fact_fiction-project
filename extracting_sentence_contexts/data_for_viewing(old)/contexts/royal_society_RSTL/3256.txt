of Limnceus stagnalis. © With the incipient formation and development of an embryo,
the yelk-hall performs in the vertical plane [par. 283.] rotatory motions around its
axis, the cause of which has not been satisfactorily explained. The yelk granules
#well, and become large and vesicular. After s0ome days the revolutions become
weaker.” Is it not possible, that the s0-called © yelk” in this instance, the granules
of which became © vesicular,” really corresponded to the mulberry-like structure I
have met with in the oyum of Mammalia and in the vesicles just mentioned ? Carvs}
has mentioned rotatory motions as occurring in the oya of Unio tumida. "These were
horizontal, and accompanied by a change in the form of the yelk. The same ob-
seryer 8aw in Anodonta intermedia corresponding motions, which were subject to
temporary cessation, and the direction of which was irregular.

289. It is an interesting fact, that in two out of the three genera above mentioned
—as affording examples of revolving ova—there has been observed a structure that
appears to be essentially the same as that which I have met with in the oyum and the
uterine vesicles in question of Mammalia, producing the appearance of a mulberry.

Correspondence in the Elementary Structure of Animals and Plants.

290. Few microscopic investigations have led to discoveries s0 interesting and im-
portant as those of Scuwanxy on the correspondence in the structure and growth of
animals and plants ; and certainly no stronger proof can be required of the importance
of the history of development to physiology. That author, basing his researches in
the animal upon the discoveries of ScuLeIDes|| in the vegetable kingdom, has demon-
strated that in development the same phenomena are exhibited in both. He has
