Generating actionable predictions requires a high level of automation which can be achieved
through a powerful combination of software and hardware, making calculations immediately
scalable for industrial and clinical applications. To make predictions which are fast enough
for actionable decision making, urgent priority must be given to such calculations on high-
performance computers. Our requirements for on demand access to large-scale computing
resources for such purposes are well known and have informed numerous initiatives across the
world to provide appropriate access mechanisms for medical and clinical research. This is part of



the core business of the Computational Biomedicine Centre of Excellence (www.compbiomed.eu)
which has innovation and sustainability at its heart. As a matter of fact, the EasyVVUQ software
which we have introduced as an open-source toolkit, and as part of the VECMA Toolkit [30], is
based on its original applications to MD as discussed here. It is now being applied widely in many
fields of concern to this theme issue of Phil Trans A, from fluid dynamics to climate prediction
and fusion energy research. As such, it can be reasonably considered that the study of uncertainty
quantification in MD is now beginning to have an impact within the wider general field of VVUQ.

8. Conclusion

Ensemble molecular dynamics simulation provides us with a powerful methodology that enables
us to connect ergodic theory and uncertainty quantification, and to obtain reproducible results
from simulations in a systematic and theoretically well-grounded manner. As evidenced in the
case of ligandâ€”protein binding free energy predictions, ensemble simulation-based approaches
