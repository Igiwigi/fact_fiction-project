flattening by the gradual diminution of its conjugate axis, while its transyerse axis
remains constant, or approaches a limit different from zero ; the conic thus tends (not to
an indefinitely extended but) to a terminated line* ; in other words, the tangents of the
conic become more and more nearly lines through two fixed points, the terminations of
the terminated line; and these terminating points, which continue to exist up to the
instant when the conjugate axis takes its limiting value=0, are regarded as still existing
at this instant, and the coincident line-pair as being in fact the point-pair formed by the
two terminating points. Similarly the two points of a point-pair may be coincident,
and we have then a coincident point-pair; such a point-pair (it must in like manner be
postulated) ordinarily arises, not from a point-pair the two points of which become coin-
cident, but from a proper conic sharpening itself to coincide with its asymptotes, and 80
becoming ultimately a pair of lines through the coincident point-pair ; and the coincident
point-pair is regarded as being in fact the line-pair formed by some two lines through the

coincident point-pair.

* A line is regarded as extending from any point A. thereof to B, and then in the same direction, from B
through infinity to A ; it thus consists of two portions separated by these points ; and considering either portion
as removed, the remaining portion is a terminated line.
