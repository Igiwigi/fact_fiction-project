are destitute of membrane, and contain abundance of yellowish corpuscles ; while on
the summit of the tentacles (fig. 3), and in irregular patches on other parts of the body,
they contain dark brownish-purple pigment granules.

Lying irregularly among these ectodermal cells, and chiefly towards the free surface
of the ectoderm, are the thread-cells (figs. 2 & 3). Two forms of thread-cells may be
distinguished,—one oviform (fig. 4, «, a'), with the invaginated sheath occupying the
axis; the other fusiform (fig. 4, 6, 0), with a slightly curved axis, and having the invagi-
nated sheath oblique. Both kinds of thread-cells are formed in the interior of certain
cells belonging to the superficial layer of the ectoderm, and may be seen, some lying
2 free among the true cells of this layer, others enclosed in their generating-cells, and
either completely immersed in the granular matter of the cell or surrounded by a large
clear vacuole (fig. 5). No facts, however, have come to my knowledge tending to throw
2 further light on the mode of origin of the thread-cells.

The deep layer of the cellular ectoderm (fig. 2, h) is formed by a very remarkable tissue,
to which I shall refer under the designation of the claviform tisxue. This is composed
of cells consisting of a yellowish granular protoplasm, entirely destitute of membrane,
and each drawn out into a long caudal process. They are frequently provided with an
: obvious nucleus. By the union of their caudal processes groups of claviform cells (fig. 6, a)
are produced whose common stalk runs to the hyaline lamella, where it loses itself in
the fibrillated stratum (5). The whole forms a very soft, pulpy, and somewhat glandular-
looking tissue, easily broken down under the compressor.

Caudate cells, of apparently the same significance, were firs: made known by KLe-
