For the sensitivity analysis of global average carbon intensity reductions of other energy
carriers and industrial processes, we assumed a linear decline of 35%, 45%, 60%, 80% of carbon
intensity from 2020 until 2050 and again from 2050 until 2070, followed by a linear extrapolation
to end-of-century values of 20, 15, 10 and 2.5gCO2/MJ, respectively. The more linear decline
compared to the power sector captures the fact that the use of solids, gases and liquids in energy
end-use sectors is harder and slower to decarbonize. CCS in the industry sector and replacement
of fossil fuels with biomass, hydrogen and carbon-neutral synthetic fuels are among the main
decarbonization options here. As shown in figure 2, the upper three decarbonization cases
approximately cover the range of SSP-based 1.5°C pathways, while the lower case falls below this
range. In this assumed limiting case, the carbon intensity of the non-electric fuel mix is reduced
by a factor of 5 by 2050 and a factor of 25 by 2070, falling to negligible levels within 50 years.
The case was constructed to reflect the fact that most IAMs of the current generation, including
those analysed here, do not include a number of breakthrough technologies that could help to
decarbonize non-electric fuels faster and deeper. This includes the production of carbon-neutral
liquids and gases, e.g. algae-based biofuels [42] and synthetic fuels generated from renewable
based Power-to-X technologies and CO2 captured from the atmosphere [43,44].

d) Sensitivity analysis of demand-side emissions reduction measures

Figure 3 shows final energy demand in the 1.5°C and 2°C SSP-based pathways from the four
IAMs. In contrast to carbon intensity, there is a large and overlapping spread of energy demand
developments in both sets of pathways (300-700 EJ/year by the end of century, ie. 75% to
75% of present day levels). This is due to the widely varying assumptions about population
and economic growth as well as resource efficiency and consumption patterns in the SSPs. On
