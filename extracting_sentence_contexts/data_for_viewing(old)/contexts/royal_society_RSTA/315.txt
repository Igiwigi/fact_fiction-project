— the consistency of the K-complex and slow sleep rhythm EEG waveform
across oscillation cycles during the progression of natural sleep and
the deepening of anaesthesia matches more closely the uniformity of the
corresponding DOWN to UP state transition and the duration of
the DOWN state in TC than in cortical neurons [2].

In summary, therefore, although complex interactions among localized
intracortical neuronal ensembles (e.g. the neocortical slice) allow the existence of
the slow oscillation in cortical territories separated from the thalamus, thalamic
inputs in vitro and in vivo appear as efficient and reliable a way of triggering
UP and DOWN state dynamics in cortical networks as intracortical stimulation.
On the basis of these findings and in view of the fact that both single TC
and NRT neurons can produce the slow oscillation working as ‘conditional
oscillators’ [2], we have recently proposed (i) that the full expression of the
slow sleep rhythm in the EEG is generated by the balanced interplay of cortical
and thalamic pacemakers (figure 3) and (ii) that the LT'CP-mediated burst of
action potentials that is invariably present at the start of each TC neuron
UP state represents a major trigger for new UP states in the somatotopically
linked cortical territory [2]. Indeed, preliminary in vivo evidence (supported by
modelling studies) has conclusively shown that temporary inactivation of the
thalamus results in the majority of cortical neurons being unable to exhibit the
slow oscillation, while the others only express occasional non-synchronized UP
states [55-57].
