Quite common and un-professional is the allowance of an assumption of causality within 3

academically were destined to get poor results at 16 years. At the age of 14, they displayed an
early warning to their parents by spending little time doing homework they felt would be beyond
them and settling down to some relaxing screen time instead. The point here is that those in
analytics should seek to avoid such causal interpretations being placed on their results without
the necessary caveats.
