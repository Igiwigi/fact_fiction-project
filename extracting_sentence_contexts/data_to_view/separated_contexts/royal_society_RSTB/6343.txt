Although
the vesicle is almost transparent, its outlines are well defined, and its shape is not in
any way variable. This is important because of the possibility of mistaking the
vesicles for droplets of secretion in the process of being exuded into the cavity. The
secretion is, in fact, very different in appearance, distribution, and staining properties
from the optic vesicles, which latter are only to be found as the peripheral extensions
of the visual sensory cells into the optic cup. The central portion of the sensory
element (opt. s.c.) forms the body of the cell. Its disposition follows that of the
pigmented cell in that, although in its middle region the cell is set almost at right
angles to the wall of the cavity, its tapering inner end bends round so as to be
orientated along the longitudinal axis of the cup.
