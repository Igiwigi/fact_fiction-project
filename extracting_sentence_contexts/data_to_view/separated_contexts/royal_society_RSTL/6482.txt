Its vapour tastes intensely sweet. Boric dioxyethide might be regarded as the anhydride of a bibasic acid: the diethylate
of boric dioxyethide would then be the ether of this acid, whilst the volatile crystalline
body just described would be the hydrated acid itself. The latter does in fact redden

SF litmus paper, but in other respects its acid qualities are. very obscure, and I have not
& been able to form definite salts with it. It therefore scarcely possesses a valid claim
Ss to a place amongst the acids.

i= Considering boric ethide to be formed by the substitution of the ethyl in zincethyl for
= the oxygen in boracic acid, Mr. Duera and myself expressed the reaction as follows :—
