C. MALET ON A CLASS OF INVARIANTS. Hence the condition yg*=117, may be expressed in either of the forms

KezQ.or $7 —2G=0

we have in fact the relation

K=I(35—20)

We s8ee also that in this case the solution of the cubic is reduced to that of the

quadratic

Py dy
22+P1; Fi 49=0

the solutions of which are 1/4, and yz

To find the invariants of the second kind of the equation of the fourth order

le us 8uppose the second term removed by the substitution x=6(t), then writing the
result in the form
