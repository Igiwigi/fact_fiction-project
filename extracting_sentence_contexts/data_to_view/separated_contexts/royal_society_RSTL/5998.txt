The general term of the series in {} is

(—PEE[1—2—SF[n—2—3P,

where the terms for which 2—2—9 is negative are to be excluded, or what is the same
thing, the series is not to be continued beyond $=n—2. But observing that [9]?
vanishes for I>9g, that is, I>%—3—1, it is in fact the same thing whether the series is
continued indefinitely or only to the term for which I=2—3—1, and we may consist-
ently with the condition $>n—2, continue the series as far as I=2n—8—1, except in
the case 3=0, when by doing 80 we include the term corresponding to 9=2—1, which
i virtue of the condition ought to be excluded. The expression for the term in question
is (=Y"[—1}[—1}*; hence if the sum of the series continued to the proper point is S,
the sum continued indefinitely (in the particular cage 38=0) is S+(—Y=[—1F[—1F.
but in every other case the um continued indefinitely is simply S. And by a well-known

theorem in finite differences, the 8wm continued indefinitely is in fact zero.
