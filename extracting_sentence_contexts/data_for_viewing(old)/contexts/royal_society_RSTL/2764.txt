they crack at the poles.

From a too hasty generalization of a small number of facts, LezUweExnork main-
tained that all fishes and birds have two short septa ; and M. SaTT16* has advanced the
same opinion in reference to fishes, and committed the additional mistake of making
every part of the fibres lie in the same plane. Dr. Txomas Youxs maintains that
there are no septa in the lenses either of birds or fishes +; and in pursning the chi-
mera of a muscular lens, he not only renounced discoveries of his own, after Lezu-
WENHOEK, but adopted grave errors which have no foundation whatever either in ob-
servation or analogy.

It is a very remarkable circumstance, that the hare and the rabbit should be the
only quadrupeds whose lenses have two septa, like that of the salmon. This fact was
obseryed by LEeEUwennoek# and also by SarriG, who remarks that the septa are
larger in the lenses of these animals than in those of fishes.

The fibres of the lenses of the hare and the rabbit are curyes of contrary flexure,
like those of the salmon, and they are distinctly toothed, though the teeth are much
smaller than those of the salmon and the cod, of which I have given a representation
in a former paper.

Although I have stated that the hare and the rabbit are the only quadrupeds whose
lenses are known to have the same structure as that of the salmon, yet there is a rare
marsupial quadruped, the Perameles nasuta of Georrroy, whose lens will probably be
found to have two septa on each of its surfaces. Professor Gran was 80 good as to
