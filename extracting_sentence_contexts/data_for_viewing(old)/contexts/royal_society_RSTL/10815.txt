speedily verified by attaching a light glass jet to a piece of soft iron, 8oldered to a brass
gpring, and letting the oft iron take the place of the telephone diaphragm. (Fig. 1.)

The results with this arrangement were still more satisfactory than those previously
obtained, and speech as well as musical and other sounds were reproduced of con-
siderable loudness, if not always very distinctly, A singular fact also revealed itself,
viz., that the effects were about the same whether the vibratory motions of the jet-
tube took place in the direction of its length or transversely. Tt should be mentioned
that certain desirable conditions of air pressure, size of jet orifice, and 8ize and
distance of flame had previously been ascertained by experiment.

At various times in the course of these experiments I had noticed that a flame
against which an airjeb was playing under 8uitable conditions, was nob only visibly
affected by sounds, but that sometimes it seemed to speak back words uttered in its
