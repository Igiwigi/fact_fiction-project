the nerve splits into three great divisions, which are sent to
the face, jaws, and tongue. Its branches go minutely into the
skin and enter into all the muscles, and they are especially
profuse to the-muscles which move the lips upon the teeth.

Of the respiratory nerve of the face, being that which is called
portio dura of the seventh.* (Plate XXX, A abcd).

This nerve does not exist except where there is some
consent of motions established betwixt the face and the re-
spiratory organs. In fishes, this nerve, instead of being
distributed forward to the face, passes backward to the mus-
cles of the gills. In fact, there is, properly, no portio dura
of the seventh in fishes, the nerve resembling it being a
branch of the par vagum. A $hort description of this nerve
in the human body will be necessary to our enquiry.

The respiratory nerve of the face arises from the superior
and lateral part of the, medulla oblongata, close to the nodus
cerebri, and exactly where the cus cerebell; joins the medulla
oblongata. The other respiratory nerves, which form s0 dis-
tinguished a part of the nervous system, arise in a line with
the roots of this.

The nerve, passing into the internal auditory foramen, is
