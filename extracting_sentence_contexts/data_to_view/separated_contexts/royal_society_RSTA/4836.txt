It should here be noted that these
transient energy releases are often considered to involve dissipation by reconnection, as in large-
scale flares, but the nanoflare scenario may apply for any transient heating mechanism. Indeed
wave heating is also naturally transient; for example, due to the nonlinear coupling between
plasma heating and damping. In fact, all heating mechanisms so far proposed will give impulsive


heating to some extent [7], but one of the fundamental questions to be resolved is the ‘degree
of unsteadiness’ [18]. Comparison of predictions from modelling with recent observations from
missions such as SDO is beginning to shed light on this [8,18]. Current sheets with energy dissipation by magnetic reconnection may be created in many
different ways, including emergence of new flux [20].
