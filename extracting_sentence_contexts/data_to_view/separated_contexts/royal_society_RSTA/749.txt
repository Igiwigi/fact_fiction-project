Because of this A (6’,) will be

Eto the fixed value of 0, = 0’. o> It may not seem obvious that the region of
‘acceptance A (6,) as defined above must exist
‘5 (contain points) for any value of 0,. In fact,
it may seem possible that for certain values of
-2 6, the hyperplane G (6,) may not cut any of
Sthe intervals  (E). It will, however, be seen
Sbelow that this is impossible. = As mentioned above, the coordinates %,, x,
2x,...%, of any sample point E determine in Fic.
