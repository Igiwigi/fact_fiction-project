In fact, in that case the family of convex caustics represented by
confocal ellipses do not foliate the whole domain (the segment between the two foci is left out),
and neither set of homotopically non-trivial invariant curves has full @-measure in the phase
space: the homotopically trivial invariant curves corresponding to orbits tangent to confocal
hyperbolae, foliate a positive @-measure set (in the phase portrait (figure 4) this set corresponds to
the area below the separatrix, i.e. the stable/unstable manifold of the hyperbolic 2-periodic orbit
corresponding to the major semi-axis of the ellipse). What about other notions of integrability? In the study of integrable systems, in fact, in most :23

Remark 4.3. An interesting result* by Innami [30] shows that the existence of caustics with : a
rotation numbers accumulating to 3 implies that the billiard must be an ellipse. This regime of [4
integrability is somehow opposite to the one we are interested in, which is concerned with caustics : >
near the boundary of the billiard table, ie. with small rotation numbers.
