for conservation and management decisions. Indeed, decisions
on which populations to exploit, to protect, to reinforce, to cull,
to create or to extirpate are frequently underpinned by societal
as well as scientific perceptions of whether the species is part of
the native fauna (and thus whether it should be there in the first
place), and if so whether it is artificially depleted or overabun-
dant (i.e. below or above the perceived norm of abundance).
For example, the forest cobras of Sao Tom√© Island in the Gulf
of Guinea were long believed to represent an introduced
subpopulation of the mainland cobra (Naja melanoleuca),
presumed to negatively affect native wildlife and thus con-
sidered for eradication, until phylogenetic and_ historical
analyses revealed that they are in fact a native endemic species
(Naja peroescobari), likely to play an important role in the control
of invasive rodents [19]. Conversely, Gulf groupers (Myctero-
perca jordani) were considered naturally rare throughout their
range in the Gulf of California, and believed to be resilient to
ongoing levels of exploitation, but historical records and inter-
views of old fishers demonstrate that they have been
substantially depleted through past overfishing, and that
their fishery needs to be carefully managed [20].

The growing awareness of the pervasiveness of the shifting
baseline syndrome [5-11], and the subsequent development of
historical ecology as an applied discipline [21], translate into
