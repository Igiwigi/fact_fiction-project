For example :—A line from Hillington on the Wash to a point midway between
St. Leonards and Southampton strikes the south coast between Littlehampton and
Worthing, cuts the generalised isobars so that they make approximately equal angles
with it, and passes very nearly at one-third and two-thirds distances through

‘ambridge and London. Thus, if the St. Leonards constants were based on a longer
period and so somewhat more satisfactory,* we might fairly accurately predict the
constants of the Cambridge and London frequencies from those of Hillington,
Southampton, and St. Leonards. We find, as a matter of fact, by interpolation : | Mean height. Standard deviation.
