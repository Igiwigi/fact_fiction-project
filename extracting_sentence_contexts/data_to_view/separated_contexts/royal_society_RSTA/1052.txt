However, a numerical model is indeed important to provide overall
structural behaviour and structural collapse potential, which would be adopted in further studies. On the other hand, it would be useful to review the past observed damage to similar
structures (ie. stupa) located in the surrounding region to constrain the upper bound of
the MMI intensity at which point these pagodas collapse. This is due to the fact that these
pagodas have brittle brick masonry as a major structural component with no lateral load
resisting system. These pagodas have only a compressive arch load transferring system to
sustain their own gravity load. These structures have no engineering design consideration
to sustain high intensity level, and hence, the intensity saturation could be expected [27,28].
