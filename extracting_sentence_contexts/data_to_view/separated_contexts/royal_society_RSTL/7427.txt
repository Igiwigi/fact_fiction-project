E BaLpraxt* has recently, in a paper which received a prize from the French Academy,
ated that the germ (with him the equivalent, of the formative yelk) may be traced to a
preexisting nucleated cell spontaneously arising on the surface of the food-yelk, which
cell by endogenous development of cells at the expense of the © primordial protoplasm ”
(food-yelk) forms the future germ on its surface. He expressly extends this view to
os8eous fishes, although he repeats the error made by Cos, that the germ (formative
yelk) only appears after fecundation. This description of the mode of origin and growth of the parts of the ovum, I feel

Justified in stating is not in accordance with observed facts.
