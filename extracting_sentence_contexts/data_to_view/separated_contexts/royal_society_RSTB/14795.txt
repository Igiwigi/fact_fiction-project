It is generally accepted that there is a
physiological response to fasting and that this involves low
fat levels which in turn cause decreased serum leptin levels. The low leptin levels will then contribute to physiological
starvation response, including intense hunger and energy
ransoming achieved by turning off several body functions [7]. Based on the fact that body weight is tightly regulated when
outside the normal range promoting fitness, either passing
below the lower intervention point or above the upper interven-
tion point, we, herein, propose the dual hypothesis of body weight
regulation, including gravity-dependent and leptin-dependent
actions. The dual hypothesis of body weight regulation is
based on the concept from Speakman’s dual intervention
point model but with the addition that the dual hypothesis of
body weight regulation also includes the main proposed regu-
lators of body weight both when passing below the lower
intervention point (leptin) and when passing above the upper
intervention point (gravity-dependent actions; figure 4). According to this hypothesis, when the animals are within
the normal range of fat mass between the upper and lower inter-
vention points, no homeostatic body regulation mechanism is
active.
