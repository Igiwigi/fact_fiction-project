The data do, however, indicate that our ideas as to the amount of destruction by
such pests are likely to err on the peSsimistic side (fig. 18). On examining the bolling-curves for 1912 and 1913, corresponding to the flowering-
curves already discussed, it will be seen that the slight water-shortage mentioned as
an accidental feature of the spacing experiment in Part I of these “ Analyses ” had
not only checked the flowering slightly, but had also provoked extra shedding. The
indication of this lies in the fact that the 1912 bolling-curve comes further away from
the 1913 one, and at an earlier stage, than do the corresponding flowering-curves. Beyond this stage, however, the same differences exist as between the flowering-
curves, viz., very slight inferiority on the part of 1913. Then a new pheno-
menon is observed ; the 1918 curve does not remain steadily at a maximum after the
manner of the 1912 (and other) curves, but falls steadily downwards from the true
maximum on September 9.
