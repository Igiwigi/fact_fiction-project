It is noted that
on July 4, some five weeks later, “the difference between the plots has become
noticeable . . . the heavily watered plots have large luxuriant plants with few
flowers, and the dry plots have thin small plants with an abundance of flowers.” (As
a matter of fact the actual difference in flowering on this date was merely as 0°67 : 0°46,
which illustrates the subjectivity of inspection methods with cotton.) Further, on
August 2, it is noted that the wet plots had “strong bushy plants, while the light
watering has given the reverse.” This is merely a particular case of the paradox so familiar to gardeners as well as
to cotton growers, but it is one which gives rise to a great deal of mental confusion,
or else to the assumption of an inherent antagonism between growth and flowering,
forgetting that flowering is the result of growth.
