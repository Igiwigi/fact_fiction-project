The positions of
the dipoles are close to, but do not coincide with, the isoporic foci of Z (figure 7), as the points
of zero H do not exactly coincide with positions of maximum Z. The average angular distance
between dipole and corresponding focus is about 5°, giving a measure of the possible positional
error of the dipole which agrees well with those (3 to 5°) estimated from the fitting of the
sections.

AL INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS

The vertical magnetic dipoles found by this analysis will in fact be horizontal circuits of
current flow, the current distribution depending on the depth at which the circuit is placed. It is found that finite current loops can be approximated by dipoles placed deeper in the
earth, e.g. compare figures 5e¢ and _/, and table 3 gives the depth of a vertical dipole whose
field distribution at the surface of the earth approximates to that of a horizontal circular
current loop at the surface of the core. Elsasser (1950) considers that the currents which produce the secular variation must
originate in a very thin shell at the surface of the core.
