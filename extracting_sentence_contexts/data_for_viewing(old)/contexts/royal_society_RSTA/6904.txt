Thus if there are exactly g least minimal indices »,, there will be g po‘nts x, and a
unique [q—1] within the stratum A, derivable from the processes such as (5). This
singles out for special prominence that %-fold directrix .4;, belonging to the locus’,
which is of lowest order n, and which meets each stratum in a [g—1]. The importance
of this directrix was first noticed by Segre (18844: cf. Edge 1931).

For example, in (4), n, = 2, = 1, so that v the number of the x; is 2; and g = 1
corresponding to the single ¥’ of least order. The locus.” of D is given by the five
parameters y;, //, and meets each stratum in a line (v = 2). It meets A at the line Agy
(where y, = y= ¥, = 0) and C at C,g, and is a ruled surface. The 0! directrix curves
meeting Ay, are conics except for a unique straight line y', the generating line ayc, of 2

in fact.

Had ¥Y’ been A 3] with an extra 9th point its tableaux would have been

on the line Ay, which they all meet.
Incidentally the above geometrical process throws light on the somewhat obscure
algebraical fact that in reducing a matrix pencil to canonical form it is the minimal
index of lowest value which first presents itself.
When D has a single minimal index , and therefore a single curve .1°, of order 7),
the canonical form of the corresponding space Y/ is explicable as follows: This curve
