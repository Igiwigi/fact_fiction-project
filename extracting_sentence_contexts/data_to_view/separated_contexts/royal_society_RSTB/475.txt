Traced ventrad, this canal simply merges into the perichondrium ; traced
dorsad, it breaks up into several canals containing small, deeply-stained cells, which
appear to be leucocytes. The middle portions of the two commissures (« and y),
separating the three fontanelles, are imperfectly chondrified, and a similar non-
cartilaginous area (w) extends on each side across the cartilage, separating the posterior
basi-cranial fontanelle from the carotid foramen. Taking all these facts into consideration, it appears to me that my former explana-
tion of the basi-cranial fontanelles (1, p. 61), is erroneous ; that the line of junction
between the trabeculz and parachordals is represented by the area w, the longi-
tudinal bands between the fontanelles indicating the plane of fusion of the trabeculee
with one another. Moreover, the cartilage immediately cephalad of w can be traced
ventrad into the ridges (1, p. 64, Plate 11, fig. 126, 7), which form the lateral boundaries
of the posterior basi-cranial fontanelle, whence it would appear that the ridges in
question represent the cornua trabeculae.
