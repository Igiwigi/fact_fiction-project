models, each of which is common, and there are two mimetic forms of polytes to
correspond ; in this region, then, selection should be most in favour of the mimetic
forms, and the cyrus % ought to be in process of disappearance. Actual results,
however, show that in no part of the range of polytes is the cyrus 2 more common, and
it can only be supposed that selection due to mimicry is effective, if it has come into
action very recently among a population which consisted in the main of the cyrus
form. This is improbable and is not supported by any evidence whatever.

Statistics as to the relative abundance of the three 2s at Peradeniya were obtained
by collecting wild larvee, and, since these were only found singly or in small numbers
throughout the whole period of the experiments, it follows that almost every
individual was the offspring of a different 2; it is probable, therefore, that the
results obtained are fairly accurate, in spite of the fact that the total number recorded
was small, Further, since polytes is one of the most migratory of species, statistics
obtained in the Peradeniya district apply almost equally to the whole of the island.

The total number of individuals reared from wild larvee was 155, among which
there were 66 fs, 40 2 cyrus, 24 2 romulus, and 25 2 polytes; the numbers of the
various ?s converted into percentages read as 2 cyrus 45 per cent, (44°94...),
3 romulus 27 per cent. (26°96...), % polytes 28 per cent. (28°09...), and there were
therefore 55 per cent. mimetic $s and 45 per cent. cyrus 2s.

This ratio, as was shown by Prof. Punnerr, is of interest, as it agrees with
Harpy’s formula for a population in Mendelian stability ; that is, in such a condition
that, in the absence of selection, the relative abundance of the three $s remains
