taken over the entire population. the two scientists corresponded prior to the publication of
Now, if all individuals in the population belong to Price’s 1970 article [4], Hamilton came to see the Price
non-overlapping groups with the mean group fitness W, equation as a cleaner and more appropriate way to formulate
each individual’s fitness can be decomposed into two his central findings on social evolution compared with his
components—the group mean and individual deviation original rather cumbersome derivation [1, p. 175]. Hamilton
from the group mean (Aw) published a Price equation-based rederivation of his central

result immediately following the publication of the Price
equation itself. In fact, the story goes that this was the
result of a collusion between the two—Hamilton pressured
Nature [1] into either publishing Price’s paper [4] or risk
wAg = cov(w,g) = cov(W + Aw,g). losing Hamilton’s own contribution [21], in a move that
seems unlikely by today’s standards. The derivation I present
here nevertheless owes the most to Queller [16], who derived
this now widely known ‘general’ model of kin selection—

w=W+(w-W)=W+Aw. Substituting this into the first term of equation (1.1) we get

Making use of the distributive property of covariance, we
can write this as

wAg = cov(W,g) + cov(Awg) . (3.2) general in the sense that minimal assumptions are needed
between-groups _within-groups in its derivation.
