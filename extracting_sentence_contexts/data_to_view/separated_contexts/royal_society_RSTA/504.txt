DIFFRACTION OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL SOUND PULSES 19

When ¢— X is not small, 8X(¢—X) is large and we can drop the tan“! symbol in the first
term to obtain the result (88) corresponding to the behaviour of the slit as a simple source. It will be noted that as ¢—X increases, the first term in (93) decreases whilst the second
increases, and the pressure has in fact a minimum, within the range of validity of (93), given
