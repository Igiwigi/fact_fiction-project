that competent cells will be transformed with DNA from clone-
mates. While passive barriers offer approximate routes to
restrict transformation, they are imprecise. By contrast, active
restrictions to DNA recognition, uptake and recombination
are significantly more limiting, and together these redundant
processes strongly bias which DNA becomes available for
transformation, relative to the broader pool of CDNA.

(a) Barriers acting outside the cell

Ecological barriers to recombination require no special mech-
anisms of exclusion and arise as a simple consequence of the
fact that persistence of eDNA is limited and because bacterial
growth is spatially structured. For these passive reasons,
HGT will tend to take place between cells that are in close
proximity to one another and thus often clonal. At a broad
scale, this leads to networks of gene exchange that are ecolo-
gically confined. For example, by examining routes of HGT
via a network approach, Popa & Dagan [7] estimated that
74% of identified HGT events occurred among bacteria resid-
ing in the same habitat. Similarly, Smillie et al. [80] found that
bacteria in the human microbiome residing in the same body
sites were more likely to exchange genes than those from
different sites. Although compelling, these examples deal
with HGT broadly and may only be partly due to transform-
