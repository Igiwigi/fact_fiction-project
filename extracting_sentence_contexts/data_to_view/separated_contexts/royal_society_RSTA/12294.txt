take some of the observations (such as those in which I wished to trace the process of
surfusion during the freezing of metals) late at night. One great difficulty I met
with at the outset, z.e., the warming of the thermometer-coil by the current used when
determining its resistance, and since it was necessary, during some of the observations
on surfusion, to maintain the current for several seconds at a time, the point was one
of considerable importance. CALLENDAR mentions that he used six Leclanch√© cells without any trouble of this
kind.
