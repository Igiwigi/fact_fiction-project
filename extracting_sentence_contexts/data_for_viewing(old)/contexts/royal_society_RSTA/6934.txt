THE STABILITY IN CERTAIN CRITICAL CASES

In order to examine the stability of the periodic motion under the conditions of
case (iii) we shall find it necessary to proceed to approximations. The criterion formu-
lated by Maxwell for the stability of a ring of particles unperturbed by a satellite was
that v should be sufficiently small. With this condition fulfilled it is possible to evaluate
approximately the quantities arising in equations (48) and (49).

The solution is dependent upon the fact that

Di(2)=0 and Dr, (Q2)=0 (50)
for the same value of Q; to which is added the further condition arising in (48) and (49)
that 9+ 5 =n, q being a positive integer. The values of ¢, and Q satisfying (50) for given
values of s and n are detailed in (31). Only the results corresponding to a positive Q
are shown; those corresponding to a negative Q refer to results applicable to rings

of particles outside the orbit of the perturbing satellite and are of no physical interest.
Consider first case (31 (i)).
