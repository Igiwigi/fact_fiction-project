This is the mode of distribution of these vessels in the great Scorpion,
Buthus afer, Lzacn, but a slight variation is found in some other species. Thus in
the specimen formerly* examined, Buthus costimanus, Roc, or a species nearly allied
to it, instead of a pair of branches given off from the subspinal yessel midway between
the second and third abdominal ganglia, I found an azygos vessel given off beneath
the latter, and which having passed forwards, midway between these ganglia, was then
divided into lateral branches like those at the anterior part of the body. This peculiar distribution of the subspinal vessel in the abdomen enables us to un-
derstand a fact that seems at first very difficult of explanation ; viz. that the branches
from the caudal artery on the dorsal surface of the tail do not anastomose with the
Spinal artery (7) that lies above the cord, and in which the course of the blood, as we
have already seen, is from before backwards, but with the subspinal vessel beneath it
(x), in which the course of the blood is inwards to the abdomen, precisely that of the
dorsal artery; s0 that the unemployed blood from this structure, and that which has
become venous, is collected as it returns from the tissues by the subspinal vessel, and
intermingled together before it is transmitted to the branchice. Structure of the Pulmono-branchic—Professor MULLErF bas already accurately de-
scribed the pulmono-branchiz as formed of a multitude of closely approximated,
thin, double lamellze, which communicate by a small orifice in each with the ex-
ternal air admitted into a common cavity through the spiracle on the surface of the
body.
