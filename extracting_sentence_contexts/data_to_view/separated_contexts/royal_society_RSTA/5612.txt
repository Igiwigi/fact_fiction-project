Furthermore, the variation in the prophylaxis level of
the young is more pronounced and thus mainly drives the evolution of the prevalence. As a
consequence, in figure 4d, we observe how the prevalence of the young group increases more
rapidly and spills over to the old group. As a matter of fact, due to the increased prevalence
tolerance caused by a lower infection cost of the young group, the reproduction number among
the old is always below one. Accordingly, prevalence in the old group solely increases due to the

inthe old (red) and young (blue) groups, evolving in time, with initial conditions fixed as in figure 3 for both groups. The adoption
rate is fixed at oc = 50 and the infection costs are To = 2000 and Ty = 500, respectively. (c) Fraction of protected individuals
and (d) fraction of infected individuals in both groups displayed in a shorter time window. (e) The fraction of cases belonging
to the old group in time.
