But in the case of such alternate tide
currents also, the time of change of their direction is not in general the time
of high water. This indeed is well known to intelligent seamen, who haye
accordingly phrases by which they express the relation of these times. When
the stream in the offing which brought the tide continues to run for three
hours after it is high water, it is said to make © tide and half tide*,” But
thongh seamen have thus noticed the fact, their recorded observations are
very far from always recognising the distinction, as will be seen when we pro-
ceed to examine them. In the cases above mentioned, 5 o'clock at Plymouth
is the time of high water there; and 8 o'clock at the Eddystone is the
time of the slack water or change of current at that rock ; the time of high
water there being, on the average, a few minutes earlier than it is at Plymouth. In like manner 4; is the time of high water at the Land's End, and 6F is
the time of a certain change in the direction of the current which is assumed
to be the change from flow to ebb : in this latter case, however, the as8ump-
tion is somewhat arbitrary, as the motion of the current is not alternately
opposite, the change of its direction being rotatory.
