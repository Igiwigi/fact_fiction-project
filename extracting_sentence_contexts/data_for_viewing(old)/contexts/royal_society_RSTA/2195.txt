with vortex strength 6 = 1. Compared to the unbounded cases, the convergence in t is very rapid. Note that there is a slight [3
asymmetry biased in the direction of the drift, which is not captured at this order of the expansion. (Online version in colour.) :

Now we return to equation (5.6). Since t is large, the integral is dominated by small A,,,, hence : s
