As the leaves of this plant bear stomata on both surfaces for the purpose of
comparison, the stomata on both sides were counted and added together. A total
of 122 determinations were made for plants grown in moist illuminated conditions and
146 of plants grown in darkness but otherwise similar conditions. As it has been shown
that some of the differences between sun and shade leaves are already recognisable
in the bud stage, the plants were thoroughly established before being experimented
upon, and, as the sequel shows that during the first season the normal differences are
found between plants grown in the sun and others which are shaded (the conditions in
other respects beside illumination not being uniform) the fact that the conditions of the
experiment preclude the use of the same plants for more than one season does not
invalidate the conclusions,
