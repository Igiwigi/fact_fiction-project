and hence the right culture conditions for robust human
naive (ground) state derivation and maintenance have not
been found yet. For instance, the murine naive ground state
PSCs require 2i-Lif, which results in robust culture across lab-
oratories. Also, new ESCs can be derived by the isolation of
the ICM in this condition. So far, however, the culture con-
ditions for human naive PSCs contain factors typical for the
primed state such as Rock inhibitor, FGF2, ACTIVIN A or
they require the transient and simultaneous overexpression
of KLF2 or NANOG [127-132]. In the light of these very
diverse culture conditions and the inclusion of factors that
are required in the primed state, it seems as if the claimed
human naive state is in fact still not fully dedifferentiated.
Therefore, key questions remain unanswered: what are the
authentic differences between the murine and the human
blastocysts in terms of developmental timing? What happens
to human ICM in contrast with the murine ICM upon iso-
lation? Why does it appear to differentiate? One potential
explanation could be the sensitivity to oxygen. Indeed, it
has been reported that there is a reciprocal relationship
between body size and oxygen tension in the fallopian
