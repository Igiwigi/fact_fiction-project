a superficial observer. When one comes to closely analyse such a record, and


THE ACTION OF INDIAN COBRA VENOM. 369

to count the beats in successive minutes throughout, one finds that the rate of beat
varies more than one had suspected. There is in fact a gradual tendency for the
heart to beat faster at first and slower later on. At the same time its excursus
slowly and steadily diminishes, and the organ drifts towards a position of diastole.
Rarely one finds a heart pass very slowly towards the systolic position, but this is
almost certainly due to some change in the blood used. Such a sample of nutrient
fluid should, of course, be rejected, as it introduces fallacies into the research.
Bearing the above facts in mind, one had to make a large number of tracings, both
normal and otherwise, and to carefully exclude all those into which fallacies, due to
the changes above described, had apparently crept.

Some of these results are given in the subjoined table, and were selected from
tracings in which the heart was either very steady, or actually slowing, at the time
venom was introduced. (For tracings illustrating this section see Plate II.) Briefly,
the case may be thus stated. Solutions of Cobra venom of a strength of 1/250,000,
of 1/500,000, and even at times of 1/1,000,000 increase the rate of heart beat and kill
the organ in a position of systole. With the last-named strength this result is,
however, far from a certainty, but the influence of the venom in “ toning up” and
quickening a heart, especially if feeble before, is unmistakeable. Solutions of a
