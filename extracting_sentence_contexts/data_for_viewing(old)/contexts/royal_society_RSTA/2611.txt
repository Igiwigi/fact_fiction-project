specimens have a higher water adsorption than transmission lubricant adsorption. The maximum
water adsorption in 24h was 49 ml of the non-woven textile made of three layers PE, cellulosic
fibres and PP and a non-woven textile made of PET. Even a technical yarn twist made of cotton
reached a level in water adsorption of 30ml after 24h. The specimen with fibres of cellulose
(artificial cellulose and cotton) achieved the highest water adsorption levels. An increase in water
adsorption could be achieved by means of the increase in mass (g mm~*) of the textiles. Most
materials are more likely to adsorb water than oil. Only the non-woven textile made of artificial
mineral fibres showed similar adsorptions for transmission lubricant and water. Based on the fact
that high amounts of water could be wrung out of the specimen after the experiment, adsorption
must have been the predominant mechanism. The results performed with water and water mixed
with 2 and 3 vol% xanthan are shown in figure 7. The increase in viscosity of water leads
to a reduction in water adsorption of the investigated non-woven textile specimen. The water
and transmission lubricant adsorption of yarn textiles depend on fibre diameter, mass and fluid
viscosity. The adsorption of 49 ml water required 6-24h depending on the textile and its material.
It is concluded that these textiles have a low adsorption velocity. For industrial applications,
higher velocities are required.

Textiles are particularly suitable for the technical transfer of complex biological surface
structures for the production of bionic adsorber materials, since the hierarchic structure could
mirror that seen in nature. Another advantage is the high adjustability of the properties
