levels with those of successive cols, which he explains by checked tidal currents,
cannot be considered satisfactory. The improbability, amounting almost to impos-
sibility, of a series of such coincidences as a period of resb concurring with the level
of each col during the general emergence of the land must be apparent. Further, the fact thab nowhere have marine organisms been found in the drift
ascribed to marine origin, has been urged as an argument against the marine hypo-
thesis. Tt is true that, in loose sand and gravel, shells may have been dissolved out
by the percolation of water; but considering the extent of the debris, the many
sections, and the occasional presence of argillaceous seams, it is difficult, to understand
their absence everywhere. It must, nevertheless, be borne in mind that even in those
low levels, which there is every reason to suppose have been 8ubmerged, marine
remains are very rare (postea,
