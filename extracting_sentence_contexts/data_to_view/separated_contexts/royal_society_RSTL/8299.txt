viz. we thus obtain the required value of M © a rational fraction, the denominator

being the determinate function F'v, and the numerator being, as is easy to see, a deter-
minate function of the order » as regards v. hf

32. The method is applicable when M is only known by its expression in terms of q;
but if we know for M an expression in terms of », v, then the method transforms this
into a standard form as above; and by way of illustration I will consider the case n=3,
where the modular equation is

vi +20%f— 20u—u=0, '
and where a known expression of M is = +2, Here writing S_,, $,(=4), S, &e.
to denote the sum of the powers —1, 0, 1, &c. of the roots of the equation, we have

S HES+20S.,, =0 , as appears from the values presently given,
$y=% +208, , =6xo,

SES +21, ,=0 ,

$E=8,+20S, , =61;

and observing that v, being ultimately replaced by v, we have

$v, =Svg—v, =Svgv, =Svgv, —vSvg +0?, v,0,v,=Sv,v,v,—vSvgv, + vSv,—v?,

that is
S$Sv,=—21®—v, Sv,v,=21% +0*, vv, =21u—20%%%—vf,
we have
