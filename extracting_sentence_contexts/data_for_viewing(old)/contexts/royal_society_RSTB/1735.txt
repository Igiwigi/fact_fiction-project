it is continuous with the Lyginodendron stem. The cortex of root 3 can be traced
right through the outer cortex of the stem. Towards the interior, a portion of the
vascular tissue of the root is also shown in longitudinal section A fifth root is seen

ly at its junction with the wood of the stem. It may be mentioned that root 4
giving off a rootlet. Fig. 184 from the next section shows the roots 3 and 4 in
obliquely longitudinal section, the plane of which passes through their central
cylinders. The vascular tissue of root 4 can here be traced through the cortex of the
â€˜stem. The great; interest of this series lies in the fact that it shows at one and the
same time the characteristic root-structure of these organs and their continuity as
_ endogenous appendages with the stem of Lyginodendron.

Hi Tn order to bring out the point in question more clearly, we have figured one of the
roots on a larger scale (Plate 24, fig. 17). his is root 3 of figs. 18 and 18a. The
more magnified figure is taken from the third section of the series, in which this root
has become free from the stem, and is seen in complete transverse section. The root-
like anatomy is here perfectly evident. The primary wood of the central cylinder has
seven angles, at which the smallest trachez are situated, and is thus of heptarch
& structure. A certain amount of conjunctive par enchyma is present among the

S primary trachee. There is a zone of secondary wood, which is so distributed that a
