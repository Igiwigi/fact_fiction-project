Asterochlena is, as it were, shifted one stage forward: the trace leaves the stele at the
bipolar stage, that is, a stage later than in Asterochlenopsis, and the changes are con-
tinued a step beyond what we may call the Asterochlenopsis-stage. It is well known
that a similar parallel progression is to be observed in other Zygopteridex.

Recent work on the anatomy of ferns tends to show that the sequence of changes
undergone by the leaf-trace has a phylogenetic significance. The most notable contri-
butions to this principle are those by Gwynne-VauGHAN and Kinston,* by W. T.
Gorponf and by Paut Bertranp.t The last-named author has ably summed up the
facts and extended the application of the principle to the Zygopteridez on the basis of his
own unrivalled knowledge of this group. We are now accustomed to look upon the

bundles in a line of ancestral forms. Thus in the present case Asterochlenopsis would
