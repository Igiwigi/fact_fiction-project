This air cannot carry of the heat of the animal, because it is
E itself confined, by its attraction to the hair or fur; and it
= transmits it with great difficulty, if it transmits it all, as has
5 been abundantly shown by the foregoing experiments. = Hence it appears why those furs which are the finest, longest,
= and thickest, are likewise the warmest.; and how the furs of
Z the beaver, of the otter, and of other like quadrupeds which
Z live much in water, and the feathers of water-fowls, are able to
F confine the heat of those animals in winter, notwithstanding
= the extreme coldness and great conducting power of the water
E in which they swim. The attraction between these substances,
Z and the air which occupies their interstices, is s0 great, that this

Y surrounding cold fluid ; and it is possible that the pressure of
= this fluid upon the covering of air confined in the interstices of
= the fur, or feathers, may at the same time increase its warmth,

or non-condueting power, in such a manner that the animal

may not, in fact, lose more heat when in water, than when in

air: for we have seen by the foregoing experiments, that, under

certain circumstances, the warmth of a covering is increased,

by bringing its component parts nearer together, or by

increasing its density even at the expence of its thickness. But this point will be further investigated hereafter. Bears, wolves, foxes, hares, and other like quadrupeds, in-
habitants of cold countries, which do not often take the water,
have their fur much thicker upon their backs than upon their
bellies.
