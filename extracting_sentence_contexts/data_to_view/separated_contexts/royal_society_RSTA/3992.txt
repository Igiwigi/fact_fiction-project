Assuming that the oscillator strength is comparable to
the transition of Cj), the individual vibrational bands will have oscillator strengths over an
order of magnitude smaller than that of the Cj) 9632.7 band. Such transitions will have
EWs in the mA range and be difficult to detect. In fact the gas-phase electronic spectrum of
Ci) has been determined in the laboratory using C4)-He in the same way as for Cfo, and
the initial astronomical search for these transitions confirms the conclusion the corresponding
DIBs will be weak, if at all detectable [47]. The candidate molecules must be present in
sufficient abundance and/or possess strong oscillator strengths in order to allow astronomical
detection. Satisfying the latter criteria could be the charge transfer transitions of C{)-M species
in which an electron is transferred between the adsorbed atom, M, and the ionized fullerene
cage [3].
