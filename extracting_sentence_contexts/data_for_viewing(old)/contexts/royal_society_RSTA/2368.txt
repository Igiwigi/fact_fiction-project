which come from the far side of the ring, it seems likely that a redshifted diffuse gas fills much of
the rear half of the CMZ.

6. Anew determination of the cosmic ray ionization rate, and the filling factor
of the warm diffuse gas in the central molecular zone

In diffuse clouds located outside of the Galactic centre, where destruction of H3* is virtually
entirely due to dissociative recombination with electrons that come primarily from the nearly
complete single ionization of carbon, the column density of H3*, N(H3°*), is proportional to the
product of ¢ and the absorption path length, L [14,17,22]. It was already apparent using essentially
the same analysis as was applied to diffuse clouds in the Galactic plane, that ¢ in the CMZ is at
least an order of magnitude higher than in Galactic diffuse clouds [23]. However, the situation in
the much harsher environment of the CMZ is in fact considerably more complex than for clouds in
the Galactic plane, because for such high values of ¢, the abundance of H3t depends on additional
factors [24]. Free electrons, the principal destroyer of H3*, are produced not only by ionization
of carbon, but also by the ionization of atomic hydrogen, which has a significant abundance. In
addition, there is competition between the ion—molecule reaction creating H3* from H2* and H2
and the charge-exchange reaction between H2* and H, which can destroy H2+ before the ion—
molecule reaction that produces H3* occurs. As a result, the expression for ¢L contains not only
N(H3"*), but also the particle density, the fraction of hydrogen in molecular form and the electron
density [24]. Both of the above effects reduce the abundance of H3*, and require a higher value
of ¢L to account for the observed N(H3*).

Measurements of H3* absorption lines originating from each of the three levels that are
populated, (1,0), (1,1) and (3,3), yield the total column density of H3*. Although there is variation
