Fortunately, the observations made with the back-up 4-inch telescope gave much better
images and seven stars could be used to estimate the magnitude of the deflection. The
reductions of the plates and the comparison plates were carried out at the Royal Greenwich
Observatory by Davidson and Herbert Furner, a ‘computer’ at the Observatory, who found
the result 1.98 + 0.12 arcsec. This result carried much more weight than that from the out-
of-focus 16-inch lens, although the outward movement of the star positions caused by the
presence of the Sun in the latter experiment was observed. Perhaps the most striking diagram
illustrating the significance of the results is diagram 2 of the paper, which shows the
deflections measured in the experiments as a function of distance from the centre of the Sun,
compared with the expectations of the Newtonian (dotted line) and the Einstein (solid line)
predictions (figure 2).

A source of some controversy was the fact that the paper describes attempts that were made
to estimate the deflection using the blurred images from the Sobral 16-inch lens. The results
depended upon whether or not there had been a change of scale of the plates because of heating of
the coelostat mirror. If the change of scale were left as a free parameter in the analysis, a deflection
of 0.93 arcsec was found, if it was assumed that there was no change of scale, the deflection was
1.52 arcsec. The authors of the paper considered that these data were too unreliable to be useful.

It is evident that all the other results were consistent with the prediction of Einstein’s General
Theory of Relativity of 1.75 arcsec and in poor agreement with the Newtonian expectation of 0.87
arcsec. The analysis was carried out meticulously by the team and they were duly cautious about
their conclusions. They wrote:

Thus the results of the expeditions to Sobral and Principe can leave little doubt that a
