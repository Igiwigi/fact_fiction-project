(iv) Regulations and rumours

Recognizing that there can be strong disincentives for
national governments to report disease outbreaks, the
revised IHR now include new powers for the WHO
to initiate a response to a PHEIC without official noti-
fication from the nation state in which it is detected
[2,36]. The move towards the use of such ‘rumours’
for detecting emerging disease threats has been
enabled by the recent advances in web-based technol-
ogies, and their importance is demonstrated by the fact
that the majority of recent outbreak investigations by
WHO were initially prompted by unofficial reports
[23]. Rapid assessment and response to rumours can
provide important health benefits, even in the event
of ‘false positives’ (i.e. disease events that turn out to
be neither novel, emerging nor of international con-
cern, but nonetheless cause morbidity or mortality).
However, reliance upon rumour-based reporting also
has potential negative consequences [39]. Rumours
do not provide the detailed epidemiological infor-
mation required to respond as efficiently as possible
in an outbreak situation [2]. False positives may
