way of monitoring the current state of the AS graph, but it tends to present only the (paid)

used tools such as Traceroute [5], which sends a stream of packets to a single destination from a : a
single observation point, with each successive packet reporting the address it has reached after ig

The effectiveness of Traceroute observations is difficult to quantify (how to count the links not 2

seen?), but it clearly depends both on the completeness of the set of destinations to which traces
are sent and on the richness and coverage achieved by the observation points from which they are
sent. Solutions to the first problem have been worked out by groups from CAIDA, DIMES and
RIPE in the past, but establishing and maintaining enough points from which to see deep into the
