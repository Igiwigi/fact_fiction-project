A simplifying property of this set of VIPs for our analysis
is that they are almost exactly evenly distributed between
VIPs that interact with RNA viruses (2691 RNA VIPs) and
VIPs that interact with DNA viruses (2604 DNA VIPs), with
1134 VIPs interacting with both. This similar number of inter-
actions makes it possible to compare sweeps at RNA VIPs
with sweeps at DNA VIPs with no bias in statistical power.

pared to the average of the control sets of non-VIPs. This
implies that the results represent average worldwide trends.
Importantly, the sets of control non-VIPs account for mul-
tiple key potential confounding factors (see Methods). Indeed,
VIPs and non-VIPs not only differ by the fact that VIPs interact
with viruses while non-VIPs either do not interact with viruses
or are not known to. In addition, VIPs and non-VIPs differ by
many other factors [8,11]. For instance, VIPs are more highly
constrained, more highly expressed than non-VIPs and have
more protein-protein interactions than non-VIPs [8,11]. If
gene expression, protein-protein interactions [36] or other fac-
tors affect the prevalence of recent sweeps on their own,
independently of interactions with viruses, they might con-
found the comparison of VIPs and non-VIPs by creating
differences between the former and the latter that have nothing
to do with interactions with viruses. Thus, we build random
sets of control non-VIPs that match VIPs for multiple potential
