We have put the labels of projection direction into quotation marks,
because the general association between the assumed direction and
the laminar patterns of cortico-cortical projection is not straightforward.

cortical types and the progression of laminar projection pat-

“In fact, this meaning aligns with the use of ‘hierarchy’ in common
