The formerly perplexing
of eyes-in-head, head on neck and torso rotations must be inte- study of 23 mammals varying in ‘dexterity’ from the slow
grated to allow the head to turn or the hand to reach towards a loris and rabbit to the marmoset and macaque [109], concerning

desired goal. To the surprise of most of the original researchers the measured volume of cortex contributing corticospinal


neurons to upper limbs, can now be put in context. Direct-pro- visual representations in even nocturnal animals like rats and

jection cortical volume did in fact correlate with dexterity, but mice. The relative representation of vision in ‘non-visual’ mam-
that volume in turn was entirely accounted for by total cortical mals such as these exceeds that of diurnal, shore-dwelling
volume. Considering the sequence of body, hand, eye and sharks and rays [94,184]—perhaps not surprising given that
mouth spatial registrations required for a monkey to request estimated night-time visual ranges on land exceed daytime
social foraging for an insect in the pelt of another monkey, ranges in water [2].
