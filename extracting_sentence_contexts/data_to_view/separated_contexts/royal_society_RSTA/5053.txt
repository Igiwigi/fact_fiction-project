The colour and brightness of the
stream of gas issuing from the converter when observed by an experienced eye,
generally give a sufficient indication, but when pig iron of a highly manganiferous
character is used, this determination is very difficult ; even those who had had much
experience made frequent mistakes, and found it impossible to produce the same
quality of metal at every operation. Mr. Rowan, of the Atlas Works, Sheffield, made use of coloured glasses, two of

continuous spectrum, it was Brunner in 1868 who first expressed the view that the
