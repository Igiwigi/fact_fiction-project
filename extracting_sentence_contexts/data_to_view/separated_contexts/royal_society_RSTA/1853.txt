Following up the hint given by a consideration of viscosities the present investigation
shows that good results can in fact be attained by treating the changes in both the
specific heat and the specific volume of the free water as being simply proportional to
the percentage of the solute present, 7.e., Sw—Sy = Px constant,

w—wy = Px constant. P is proportional to 1/(E+H).
