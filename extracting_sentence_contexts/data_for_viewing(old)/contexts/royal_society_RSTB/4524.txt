second, one would expect to be limited to a brief period after the stop of the work,
whereas the last three would be operative for a longer period and would cease more
gradually. The excess respiratory exchange per minute in our experiments is far
greater in the first period after the stop than in any of the subsequent periods, and
after the great primary fall diminishes more and more gradually as the final steady
value of the respiratory exchange is approached.

The fact that there is a temporary sharp rise of the respiratory quotient to 1-0
or beyond, «e., that the CO, output is for a brief time actually in excess of the
oxygen absorption, immediately after the stop of the exercise has been noticed by
other observers (Lonwy, Karzenstery, Zuntz and Hagemann, Zunrz and Scuum-
Buna ; loc. cit.). These authors have suggested that the cause of this is to be found in
the fact that in addition to COQ, other substances derived from the active muscles
(e.g., lactic acid) stimulate the respiratory centre, and that on cessation of the work
the breathing remains exaggerated until these substances can be oxidised, the
exaggeration of the breathing implying, of course, washing out of CO, from the body
in excess of the oxygen absorbed.

This theory alone seems to us quite insufficient to explain the facts. The sharp
rise of the respiratory quotient is shown in our experiments no matter whether the
