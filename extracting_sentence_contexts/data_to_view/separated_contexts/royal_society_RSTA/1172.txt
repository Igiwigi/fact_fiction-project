The one technology area needing development to enable such
a mission is generating sufficient electric power.

2. Technologies for transfer from Earth to an ice giant

To conduct extended science operations within an ice giant system, a spacecraft must first make
the long journey from Earth to the ice giant. The fact that only one spacecraft, Voyager 2 [1], has
made this journey speaks to its difficulty. Extended operations also require that the spacecraft
remain in the planet's vicinity, so insertion into orbit is required. Various hardware considerations,
such as usable lifetimes of critical components and subsystems, and performance of propulsion
systems required for orbit insertion, limit the acceptable transfer trajectories.
