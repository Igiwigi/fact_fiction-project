But it differs from the experimental elasticity
constants. This is an incongruity not of the theory, but of the experimental results. In
fact, the measurements of ¢c,, are rather inaccurate (it has been measured only within
10% error). Therefore the experimental values agree with the theoretical values within
the limits of error. The perfect agreement of the experimental and theoretical values of ¢,, are a strong
confirmation of the theory; for, the theoretical value of c,, does not depend on A (ork),
but only on the lattice constant.
