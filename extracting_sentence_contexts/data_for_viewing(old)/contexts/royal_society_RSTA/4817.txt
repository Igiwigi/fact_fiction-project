bulk of the wave function stretches much further, away from x. Mathematically, working out the
sum is laborious, and it does not lead to simple special functions because of the square root. We
did find powerful approximation methods, and arrived at functions that can be plotted [6,8].

The most important conclusion of this article is that quantum harmonic oscillators are closely
related to completely classical periodic features in a classical, deterministic description of Nature.
In many branches of physics, one encounters oscillating modes, where the energy quanta play the
role of fundamental particles. Now, if the periodic phenomena in the deterministic system would
never deviate from their periodic pattern, they would not leave a trace elsewhere, and therefore
play no significant role; this would imply that the quantum particles associated to them would
not interact. Interacting particles are associated to not-exactly-periodic features of the automaton.
2In the case of finite N, the £ operator, derived from equation (2.7), connects the lowest energy state |0)z to the highest energy
state |N — 1); one would be tempted to ignore this term in the limit N oo, but then unitarity will be violated. The fact that
there is a small subset of states, called ‘edge states’, for which the one-to-one mapping linking quantum mechanics to classical

mechanics fails, may be an important feature to keep in mind; it happens in other examples as well; see our remarks about
“edge states’ later.


Operators such as ¢(t) have the property that they commute at all times. Indeed, in the case
of the harmonic oscillator, our treatment leads to a basis transformation that allows us, starting
from a system with non-commuting operators x and p (the harmonic oscillator), to re-describe it
in terms of only commuting ones, |y(t)). Such operators will be referred to as beables. Thus, beables
B;(t) are defined to be operators obeying
