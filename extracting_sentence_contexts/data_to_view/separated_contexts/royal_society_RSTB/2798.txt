The first two only of these are illustrated, and indeed their first effects indicated in
the Bryophytes ; but all have been involved in the origin of the Pteridophytes; they
will now be briefly discussed.

(5). With the exception ofthe very simplest sporogonia (Zt/ccia) there is a structural
and functional distinction of apex and base. In certain sporogonia the similarity of
structure of the young seta and capsule suggests that the former is a sterilised region.
of the same nature as the head, In the Pteridophyta such indications are naturally
less clear, though the structural similarity of the vegetative and fertile regions of
Lycopodium Selago point to a similar conclusion. ‘The facts, inconclusive as they are,
coincide with a theory of sterilisation as the source of the basal vegetative region.

(6). In all Archegoniate plants the spores are produced internally, being covered by
at least one layer of protective cells; but the depth within the plant-body at which
they are produced is chiefly determined by the facilities for nutrition, and by the
method of dissemination, while it is also closely dependent upon the bulk of the
sporogenous tissue itself. In a small sporogonium the conveyance of nutriment
throughout the sporogenous group is easily effected, though this may be a solid mass of
cells occupying a central position, as in Jticcia.
