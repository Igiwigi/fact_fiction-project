The same precipitates are obtained from the
neutralized as from the acid s0lution. Such were the preliminary observations made
on repeating DoBEREINER's experiment. One important fact was observyed in this preliminary trial, viz. that nitric oxide
disappeared during the action, and in fact only occurred when the transformation
was 80 violent as to escape control. This gas was therefore probably one important
cause of the change, and it therefore became necessary to examine its action on the
cyanides, as a more simple means of eliciting its mode of action.

3. The first obvious experiment was to ascertain whether cyanide of potassium
charged with nitric oxide would produce prussides exerting the remarkable colouring
action on the sulphides.
