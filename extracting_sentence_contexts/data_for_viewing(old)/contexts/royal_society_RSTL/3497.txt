Ds La Rive should be named as most clear and constant in his views, and most
zealous in his production of facts and arguments, from the year 1827 to the present
time.

1798. Examining this question by the results of definite electro-chemical action, I
felt constrained to take part with those who believed the origin of voltaic power to
consist in chemical action alone (875. 965.), and ventured a paper on it in April
1834+ (875, &c.), which obtained the especial notice of Manmaxinrh. The rank of
this philosopher, the observation of Fzcaxes||, and the consciousness that over the
greater part of Italy and Germany the contact theory till prevailed, have induced me
to re-examine the question most carefully. I wished not merely to escape from error,
but was anxious to convince myself of the truth of the contact theory ; for it was
evident that if contact electromotive force had any existence, it must be a power not
merely unlike every other natural power as to the phenomena it could produce, but
