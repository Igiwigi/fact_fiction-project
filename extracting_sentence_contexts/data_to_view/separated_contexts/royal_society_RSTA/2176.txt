Stationary solutions. We will be interested in equilibrium configurations, i.e. in stationary
solutions of these equations. A well-known fact is that the Bernoulli function is a first integral
for both X and w. In particular, the streamlines are confined into the level sets of B. The stationary Euler equations with the Bernoulli formulation are
