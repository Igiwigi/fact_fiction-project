In the
case of persons with a greater increase in the hemoglobin percentage (for instance,
Ropison or Drviney, who were living on Pike’s Peak) the excess of venous oxygen
pressure would be still greater. If we calculate the mean oxygen pressure in the
blood of the capillaries the result is still in favour of the blood on Pike’s Peak, in spite
of the fact that the initial oxygen pressure at sea-level would be greater for a moment. Even if we take into account the fact that the blood loses a good deal less oxygen in
the central neryous system than in the muscles, the calculation shows no diminution in
the capillary oxygen pressure on Pike's Peak as compared with that at sea-level. We thus seem forced to the conclusion that the continued stimulus of oxygen want
cannot be explained by mere reference to diminished saturation of the hemoglobin,
or correspondingly diminished arterial oxygen pressure. At lower altitudes the same
