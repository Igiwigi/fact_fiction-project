Since the two different expressions compute to the
same value 999, we could say that they are literally equivalent. But of course, 27 x 37 and 999
are different qua arithmetic expressions since they convey different computational contents. The
use of the symbol = can then be understood as an abuse of notation resulting from the fact
that the two expressions yield the same numerical value after performing the corresponding
computation. In other terms, 27 x 37 and 999 are in the same equivalence class defined by the
equivalence relation ‘two arithmetic expressions a and b are equivalent if they yield the same
numerical value after computation’. In Frege’s terms, we could say that 27 x 37 and 999 express
different senses (or modes of presentation) of the same reference.
