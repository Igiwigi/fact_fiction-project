The theory of integrable systems appeared as a group of methods which can be applied to find

exact solutions of dynamical systems, and has grown in a separate field of investigation, which : &
uses methods from other branches of mathematics and has applications in different fields. Dos

The present survey collects open problems in the field of finite-dimensional integrable systems, : =
and also in other fields, whose solution may influence the theory of integrable systems. We do : a
hope that such a list will be useful in particular for early stage researchers, since many problems 73
in the list can, in fact, be seen as possible topics of PhD theses, and also for people from other aes
branches of mathematics, since for many problems in our list their solutions are expected to use 22
‘external’ methods. a]

Many open problems in our list are fairly complicated and are possibly out of immediate reach; : =
in this case, we tried to also present easier special cases. But even in these cases, we tried to keep : =
the level of problems high—in our opinion, for most problems in our list, the solution deserves to : Bs
be published. ,

This list is motivated by the series of FDIS conferences organized every second year at different
locations (in 2017, in Barcelona), and which is possibly the most important series of conferences
in the theory of finite-dimensional integrable systems. Many problems in our list are suggested
by the participants of this conference.
