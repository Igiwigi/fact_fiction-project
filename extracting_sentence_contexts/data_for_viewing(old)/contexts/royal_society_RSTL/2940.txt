lation of animal heat and the functions of respiration and circulation in insects, I
Shall endeayour to prove that every species maintains a distinct temperature of body,
the amount of which differs in the different states of the insect.

I was first led to the particular consideration of the subject of temperature in in-
sects by some observations on the temperature of wild bees in their natural haunts,
which were made by myself at Richborough, near Sandwich in Kent, in the autumn
of 1832, at the suggestion of Dr. Marsnas Har, for the purpose,—similar to that
of my observations on respiration, as noticed on a former occasion*,—of ascertaining
what relation, if any, subsists between the natural heat of these insects in their hyber-
nating condition and the irritability of their muscular fibre. The results of these
obseryations on the temperature of Bees are shown on Table HI., Nos. 1 to 14,
and together with many other facts connected with the physiology of insects were
communicated to Dr. Har, a short time afterwards. These observations were

+ In submitting these observations on the Temperature of Insects to the consideration of the Royal Society,
I have felt myself imperatively called upon to make the above remark, in explanation of the nature of my sup-
poxed obligations to Dr. Mansnar Har, with regard to this and other 8ubjects connected with the Physio-
logy of Insects, in consequence of certain misrepresentations which were made on a recent occasion respecting
my communications with that gentleman ; and I beg further to tate, that many of the views here advanced
respecting the temperature of insects, and also most, of the subjoined Tables, particularly those on the tempera-
ture of the Hive Bee, from the commencement of my observations to the month of May 1836, were commu-
nicated by myself to Dr, Maxsnarr Hair, at his own particular request, in the beginning of July 1836, in the
