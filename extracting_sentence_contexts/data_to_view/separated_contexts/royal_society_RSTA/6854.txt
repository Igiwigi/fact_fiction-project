Also,
for A =A,,i, both ¢ and v2 vanish. It is evident now that A,,;, must agree with Rayleigh’s
criterion (29) (not (2)). On the other hand, the agreement of (223) with Rayleigh’s criterion
(29) should not be allowed to obscure the fact that the physical situations contemplated
on the two theories are entirely different. As we have already remarked the Rayleigh-

Jeffreys theory applies only to the case of marginal stability; whereas, we are considering
the state of affairs when the criterion for stability given by that theory has been far surpassed.
