produced in this way.

Another way of considering this question is to calculate the number of times each
molecule of air inside the cylindrical electrode must collide with the filament per
second to produce the observed current, assuming that each collision sets free one
corpuscle. In the experiments in question the cylinder had a volume of about
1 cub. centim., so that each molecule present would have to pass backwards and
forwards between the filament and the cylinder some 10° times each second, This
seems to be an impossible feat for an uncharged molecule.

Both these points of view lead to the conclusion that the corpuscles are not
produced by a dynamical action between the molecules of the surrounding gas and
the surface of the metal. In fact, all the experimental results seem to point to the
view that the corpuscles are produced from the metal by a process similar to
evaporation. The effect of the surrounding gas, of impurities in the wire, and of its
previous history are to be regarded as due to alterations in the property of the metal
which corresponds to latent heat in the theory of evaporation.

‘ The Edison Effect.

It will readily be seen that the results which have been obtained furnish a
complete explanation of the phenomenon known as the Edison effect. vison first
discovered this effect by connecting an insulated electrode, which was symmetrically
