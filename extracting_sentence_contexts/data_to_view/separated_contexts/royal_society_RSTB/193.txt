Darwin recognised in the

@ electric organs one of the “special difficulties of the Theory of Natural Selection;” *

*B and, although we now understand their structure and development, it is still ‘ impos-
sible to conceive by what steps these wondrous organs have been produced.”

'2 Although the structure and development of the electric organ of the Torpedo has

z been determined, we are as ignorant as before of its phylogeny.

£ Almost the only chance of our obtaining a hint as to how the organ passed through

# its initial stages, as to the causes which were at work while the muscular fibres were

in process of conversion into electric cells or dises, seems to be by turning to the

E so-called ‘ pseudo-electric”t organ of the Skate.

& The organ of the Skate has hitherto received comparatively little attention from

zy biologists. We are mainly indebted for what we know of its structure to Rosry,{

= while the limited information we possess as to its development is entirely due to the

g inquiries of BaBucHin. A In turning to the common Gray Skate (Ztaia batis), one is at once struck with the
remarkable fact that, while the organ has not yet been proved to have any special
‘use, it is apparently as structurally perfect as the organ of the Torpedo. The
presence of an extremely complex apparatus, having no evident function, is difficult
to understand ; and, before venturing any explanation of this unusual circumstance, it
is desirable, if possible, to enquire whether the organ of the Skate is on the up or the
