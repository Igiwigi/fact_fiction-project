W. G. RIDEWOOD ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE

ascending filament become united across the interlamellar space, an interlamellar
septum is formed; and in the filaments of Are granosa and Area americana
(fig. 10A, p. 199), and the principal filaments of Pecten and Spondylus, the appear-
ances are decidedly suggestive of the fact that the great flap developed on the
upper part of the descending filament has been unable to produce a high septum in
consequence of the failure on the part of the ascending filament to respond to a
sufficient degree in the same direction. It is a significant fact that interlamellar junctions having the form of rods occur
only in those genera with feeble development of subfilamentar tissue, viz., certain
Filibranchia and Submytilacea. Pinna, it is true, is an exception, but there
is reason for believing that the three interlamellar bars to each principal filament of
this genus are the relics of a fenestrate septum (fig. 17A, p. 214).
