Up to this point we have assumed that the motion in yaw is exactly periodic with
half-period QT. This would be exactly true if the couple M were a function of 4 only,
OP a fixed straight line, and no other couples existed. In actual fact, M is a function
of the forward velocity and therefore of the time; OP changes direction under the
influence of gravity and the cross-wind force, and other couples besides M act on the
shell, depending on the angular velocity of the shell. All these factors cause progressive
changes in the curve of yaw from period to period ; for the case of the stable rounds
they have been discussed at length in (A), where it is shown that they do not appreciably
affect the determination of M at any velocity for small values of 4. In particular,
the effect of gravity is almost entirely allowed for by using (as we do)
