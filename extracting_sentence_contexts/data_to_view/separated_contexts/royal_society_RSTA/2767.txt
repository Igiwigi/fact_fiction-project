There is, therefore, great interest in determining how far back in time plate tectonic processes

operated on Earth—or at least when plate tectonics became the dominant mode of planetary : =
dynamics, as it is at the present day. The formidable challenge here is that the accessible record : a
of the critical early part of Earth evolution is incredibly sparse. It could in fact be argued that 3
we know more about the early history of the Moon from the few Apollo sample return missions, : XS
than we do about the early history of the Earth. The conventional explanation for this is that : _
the Earth is a dynamic planet where plate tectonics is operative, generating new crust and 4
resurfacing the planet, erasing or at least smudging, the earlier record. In this view, the very :s
process we are attempting to study has effectively camouflaged the geological imprint of its past : S
operation, as well as that of any geodynamic predecessors—in contrast to the early planetary [Ss

history vividly preserved on the surface of Earth’s neighbours Venus and Mars (e.g. [14])—
although it is important to note that plate tectonics may not be the only mechanism to destroy
crust, especially in a hotter early Earth (e.g. [15]).
