hermal agitation. From the mirror substrate alone, the scale is approximately
4E-17m/Sqrt(Hz) at 1Hz Fourier frequency [32]. The laboratory vibration-
resistant vertical cavities may be 70mm long, and so we can essentially predict a
spectral frequency density of 0.25 Hz/Sqrt(Hz), with 1/Sqrt(f) frequency scaling.
We show these dependences graphically in figure 7, along with data for the two
best reference cavity systems studied up to now. Expressing the results in an
Allen Deviation graph, such as figure 6, the thermal noise turns out to be flat at
longer times. In the figure, the solid horizontal line is the thermal noise calculated
for this cavity. So even coherent lasers are limited by thermal noise!

5. Other applications for standards’ technologies

There is a potential weakness of incorporating experimental facts, whose validity
we can know only approximately, into statements that we come to rely on. Take
for instance: ‘the Speed of Light is a Constant of Nature’. Well yes, let us do start
with that and then see in which decimal the deviation will be found. We hardly
ever find out something which is exact. Our statements usually have to say ‘in the
