formations in the germinal membrane interposed between the newly formed ante- and
the permanent penultimate segment.

The development of segments is one of the first changes in the embryo, and com-
mences eyen before it bursts from the amnion. It is repeated with corresponding
numbers at each change of tegument. In the Tulus terrestris, during the earlier
transformations, the addition is sextuple at each change, a ratio that agrees most curi-
ously with the number of segments found in the adult state. But it is not to be in-

ferred, from this fact, that this is the number of segments produced at each change
in all the Chilognatha, or that the new segments are produced in a corresponding
part of the body in the other divisions of this class, the Chilopoda. In these two
orders the parts in which the new segments appear differ greatly, and most distinctly
mark these two divisions of the Myriapoda. In the Chilognatha the segments are
always produced as above stated, but in the Chilopoda, the proper Scolopendradze,
according to Gervars*, the new parts are developed between each of the original
segments. These are remarkable differences in the modes of growth of the two
orders of this aberrant and most singular class. Although the new segments make
their appearance at the same part of the body in all the Chilognatha, they differ in
number in different animals of this group, and from the few observations I have yet
made, I am inclined to believe that this difference is characteristic of different genera.
Thus in Julus terrestris it is sextuple through the earlier periods of life, but in a
