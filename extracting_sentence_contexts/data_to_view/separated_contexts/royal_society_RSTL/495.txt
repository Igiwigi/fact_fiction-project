On the Power of the Eye to adjust
itself to different Distances, when deprived of the Crystalline
Lens. By Everard Home, Esq. F. R.S.

Read November 3, 1801. I: is intended, on the present occasion, to state some facts and
observations, in support of an opinion advanced in a former
lecture, that the adjustment of the eye to see objects at different
distances, does not depend upon any internal changes in the
crystalline lens. The first of the experiments which will be stated, was made
with the assistance of the late Mr. Ramsptn; and, had not
the death of that valuable member of this Society deprived me of
his further aid, the following observations would undoubtedly
have been more deserving the attention of my learned audience. It is impossible for me to mention Mr. RamsDEN, from whom
I have received 80 much assistance in every pursuit connected
with optics and mathematics, in which I have been engaged,

without availing myself of this opportunity of paying that tribute
of gratitude to his memory, which feelings of delicacy prevented
me from offering to him while alive.
