approach between solids 5 for punches whose shape functions f are monomial f(r) = Byr4, where
r is the polar radius, d is the degree of the monom, and Bj is a positive constant whose physical
dimension depends on d. In particular, Love [2] obtained a solution for d = 1 (a cone), Shtaerman
[3] presented a solution for d =2n where n is an arbitrary natural number, and Galin [4] solved
the problem for an arbitrary d > 1. In fact, Galin [4,5] presented a solution for an arbitrary convex
punch of revolution.

It is important to note that the influence of effects of adhesion between solids increases at
micro-/nanometre length scales. Assuming that adhesion between points of two rigid spheres
of radii Ry and R32, respectively, is caused by the London intermolecular forces and that these
interactions are additive, Bradley [6] calculated the force of adhesion Pg, between the spheres as
Pagh = 20wR where R is the effective radius of the spheres R1l= Ri! +R51, and w is the work
of adhesion. In fact, he calculated the force of adhesion between each point of the former sphere
with all points of the later sphere and then integrated the results obtained for all points of the
former sphere. The calculations were rather lengthy, while the same result was derived just in a
couple of lines by Derjaguin [7] using his approximation.

Derjaguin [7] stated that elastic deformations of spheres should be taken into account in
order to consider their adhesive contact. In his excellent paper, Derjaguin argued that adhesive
interactions may be reduced to interactions among surface elements of spheres (see a discussion
about the Derjaguin approximation in [1]). Derjaguin stated also [7] that the virtual work done
by the external load during adhesive contact is equal to the sum of the virtual change of the
potential elastic energy and the virtual work that is consumed by the increase of the surface
attractions. Unfortunately, the paper contains some erroneous assumptions and miscalculations.
Nevertheless, using Derjaguin’s results, Sperling in his PhD thesis [8] derived the force—
