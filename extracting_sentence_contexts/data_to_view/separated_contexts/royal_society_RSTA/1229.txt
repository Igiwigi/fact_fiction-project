The coefficient b(x,y), often called the
fragmentation kernel or daughter distribution function, can be interpreted as giving the number
of size x particles produced by the fragmentation of a size y particle; more precisely, it is the
distribution function of the sizes of the daughter particles. In most investigations into (1.1), b is
assumed to be non-negative and measurable, with b(x, y) =0 for x > y and

but is otherwise arbitrary. Equation (1.4) can be viewed as a local mass conservation property,
as it expresses the fact that, when the size variable is the particle mass, the total mass of all
the daughter particles produced by a fragmentation event is the same as that of the parent
particle. In the case of deterministic models, with either discrete or continuous size, two main
approaches have been used extensively in their analysis, with one involving weak compactness
arguments and the other using the theory of operator semigroups. Comprehensive treatments of
each are given in [1], and there is also an excellent account in [7, ch. 36] of the semigroup approach
to the discrete fragmentation equation.
