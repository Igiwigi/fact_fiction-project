those effects. When this has been done it will be found that apparently complex
tidal phenomena in the South Channel are really very simple.

Tt has often been pointed out that the Irish Sea behaves like a resonator with two
open ends. The rise and fall of tide at the two open ends, which are “loops” in the
oscillation, is small, while the current is a maximum at these points. In the middle
of the Trish Sea in the neighbourhood of the Isle of Man, the currents are small while
the rise and fall of tide is large. If the motion of the sea at the two channels is at
all similar to a “loop” in a stationary oscillation, it may evidently be analysed into
two waves, one going in and the other coming out.

We shall assume that the motion of the water in the South Channel is all backwards
and forwards along the channel, as in fact the current observations show it to be.
We have seen that the effect of the deflecting force due to the earth’s rotation is to
increase the tide on one side of the channel and to decrease it on the other, leaving
the rise-and-fall of the central part of the channel unaffected. We shal! deal first
with the tidal phenomena which do not depend on this deflecting force, by considering
the motion in the central part of the channel.
