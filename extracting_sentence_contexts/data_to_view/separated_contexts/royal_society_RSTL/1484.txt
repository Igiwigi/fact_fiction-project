With this prepossession, I venture to submit
to them some observations upon the movement and state of
the mercury upon the coasts of New Holland and New South
Wales, the Terra Australis, or Australia, of the earlier charts. The principal circumstance that has led me to think these
observations worth some attention, is the coincidence that
took place between the rising and falling of the mercury, and
the setting in of winds that blew from the sea and from off
the land, to which there seemed to be at least as much re-
ference, as to the strength of the wind or state of the atmo-
sphere; a circumstance that I do not know to have been
before noticed. The immediate relation of the most material
of these facts, it is probable, will be more acceptable than any
prefatory hypothesis of mine ; and to it, therefore, I proceed;
only premising, that a reference to the chart of Australia will
be necessary to the proper understanding of some of the
examples. My examination. of the shores of this extensive country
began at Cape Leuwen, and continued eastward along the
South coast. In King Grokct's Sound, December 20, 1801,

after a gale from WSW, the mercury had risen from 29,42
to 29,84, and was nearly stationary for two days, the wind
being then moderate at NW, with cloudy weather.
