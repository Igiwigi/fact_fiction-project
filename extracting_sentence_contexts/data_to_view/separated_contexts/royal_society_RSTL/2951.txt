But it may be remarked, that
some of the specimens which had been broken in the extraction, and whose
interior had been considered as sufficiently exposed for the correct examination
of all their lamine, were found to exhibit some slight differences in their
centres, on a more complete division. I shall adopt the same plan which I pursned in my former paper, and present
the results of the analysis in a tabular form, giving, in the order of their occur-
rence from the centre, the consecutive deposits of the different materials of
which the calculi are composed, according to the most prominent character of
such material. I shall include in the Table, both those of the former, and the
present analysis, amounting together to 663 specimens, in order to present, at
one view, a summary of the chemical composition of the whole cabinet *.

* T have placed in the cabinet, a book containing an outline of each calculus, with references; and
would also observe, that some of the facts stated in this communication, have been added since it was
presented to the Society,
