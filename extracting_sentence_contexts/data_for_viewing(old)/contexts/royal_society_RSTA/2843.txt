Boz, =(x+y + O(y?),y + O(y')).

In particular, near the boundary {y=0}, this map can be seen as a small perturbation of
the integrable map (x,y) (x + y,y), and hence, under suitable regularity assumptions, KAM
theorem can be applied (it is sufficient, for example, that 02 is C®, so that the map is at least ©).
Hence, there exists a positive measure Cantor set of smooth homotopically non-trivial invariant
curves for the map which accumulates on {y = 0} and on which the motion is smoothly conjugate
to a rigid rotation with Diophantine rotation number (see [17,24] for a refined version); this
translates into the existence of a positive measure set of caustics, accumulating to the boundary
of the billiard table.


Remark 3.5. Observe that it is extremely important that @ is strictly convex. In fact, Mather [25]
proved the non-existence of caustics if the curvature of the boundary vanishes at one point. An
alternative proof of this result has been provided by Gutkin & Katok [26], where the authors
also investigate how the shape of the domain determines the location of caustics, establishing the
existence of open regions which are free of caustics and estimating (from below) the size of these
regions.

The next step consists then in asking in which cases these caustics foliate the whole billiard
table or an open dense subset of it, as it happens in the circular and elliptic cases. In other words:
Are there other examples of integrable billiards?

This apparently naive question turns out to be much more difficult to extricate, and it has
given rise to one of the most famous (and somehow impenetrable) open problems in dynamical :
