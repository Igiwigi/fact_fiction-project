We were next induced to seek for some such connexion between the attraction of
the different acids for water, and their transfer to the zincode. Our experiments had
already embraced a great variety of acids, differing very much from one another in
this respect, and in every case the transfer had taken place; but our attention had
not yet been directed to the quantitative results.

(a.f.) As tungstic acid forms no definite hydrate and is insoluble in water, we
Selected it as an extreme test of the fact, and for this purpose prepared some pure
tungstate of s0da (NaO, WO,) by fusing together equivalent quantities of the acid and
carbonate of 80da. The product of the operation was dissolved and erystallized. A
solution was made which contained one-twentieth of its weight of the salt; it was
placed in a diaphragm apparatus, and was found to conduct badly.
