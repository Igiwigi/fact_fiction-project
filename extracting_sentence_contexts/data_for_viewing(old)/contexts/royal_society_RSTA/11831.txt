A reference alone to that recent and most valuable contribution to terrestrial
magnetism, “A Magnetic Survey of the British Isles,” by Professors A. W.
Ricker, F.R.S., and T. E. Txorrr, F.R.S., is quite sufficient to show the certainty
of these disturbances.

Our knowledge of the magnetic elements on land and their disturbances is con-
stantly being added to, but there is a much larger area for exploration, which, whilst
leaving the dry land to the observers on land, seems specially to belong to those
> whom we may term the seagoing magneticians, namely, the broad sea, the coasts
washed by the sea, and what is equally important to science and navigation, the land
under the sea. It is a fact that as yet we have not obtained anything like an exact
knowledge of the form which the “isomagnetics” may take on going from the
assumed normal lines, passing from over the deep sea to cross depths of water under
100 fathoms, until the dry land with its known disturbances is reached.

Although along those parts of the coasts of great continents more commonly
visited, several series of observations of the magnetic elements have been made by the
war-vessels of various nationalities, for the coasts of Australia, from Adelaide
westward round north to Cape York, there were, previous to 1885, only some three
or four stations at which either Dip or Force had been observed.

To remedy this defect as far'as possible, Admiral WuHarton, F.R.S., Hydrographer
to the Admiralty, caused H.M. surveying vessel “ Meda” to be furnished with the
