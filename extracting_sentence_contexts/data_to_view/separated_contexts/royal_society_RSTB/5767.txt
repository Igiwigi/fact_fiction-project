There are no grounds for supposing that the unaided primitive streak, in normal
development, induces the medullary plate from non-presumptive ectoderm, since
under normal conditions it is aided by the material movements, which have been
initiated at an earlier stage. Even if the transverse movements of material are originally
initiated by the primitive streak, this does not affect the argument given above which
applies to the organising capacity of the primitive streak of later stages, from which
the inducing grafts were made. Similarly, it is clear that the transverse material
movements themselves do not in normal development give rise to the axial region of
the embryo, since they are in fact added by the primitive streak, which has been built
up by the longitudinal movements of a still earlier stage. GENERAL Discussion. As was stated in the Introduction, the previous experimental work on the development
of the chick has been largely confined to a study of self-differentiation.
