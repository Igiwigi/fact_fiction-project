Although I be positively certain of this very remarkable ap-
pearance at both cusps, and of its per≈øect similarity, in all my
observations, I could not, however, trace any vestige of a like
crepuscular light at any other part of the terminating border :
nor could I on the very next evening, being the 23th, and also
on the 26th of February, perceive, even at the cusps, any of
the twilight I expected to see there; the very thin, faint, lu-
minous line which did indeed appear on the 26th, at the
southern cusp between a and b, fig. g, being undoubtedly the

effect of the immediate solar light, probably illuminating some
prominent, flat area, as yet situated in the dark hemisphere. Thus far the observations: and now for the application of
them. ;

I need hardly insist upon the proofs, that the very faint pyra-
midal glimmering light, observed on the 24th of February, at
the extremities of both cusps, could by no means be the imme-
diate effect of the solar light, all the circumstances of the ob-
servations militating uniformly and decidedly against this
supposition, which, were it true, would oblige us to admit a
most unaccountable diminution of light, and thence also a
density of the lunar atmosphere, that ought to exceed even
the density of ours; a fact absolutely contradicted by all the
lunar. observations hitherto made. This light, indeed, was s0
very faint, that it disappeared at /7* 20', when the moon ap-
proached the horizon ; whilst, on the other hand, Aristarchus,
which had no light but what it received from the earth, was
$ill very distinguishable ; and the summit of Leibnitz 1, fig. 1,
(which, though far within the dark hemisphere, was, however,
illuminated by the immediate solar rays) displayed a degree-of
brightness which, although when compared with that of the
cusp d ef, it appeared very faint and dwindling, equalled, how-
ever, that of our Pic of Teneriffe. Nor can it be. conceived
why this glimmering light broke off so suddenly at both the
cusps, without a progressive diminution.
