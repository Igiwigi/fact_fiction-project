Here then we have a second instance in which an ab-
sorbent tissue has its function finally suspended, and a new one substituted. In the
place of increasing at the cost of pre-existing tissue, growth is suspended, and it
unites with and assumes a similar office to that of the surrounding gum. In conclusion, the authors may allude to an interesting fact, with reference to the
subject of absorption, which has been recently observed by Mr. STaxLey and subse-
quently by Mr. Bowman.
