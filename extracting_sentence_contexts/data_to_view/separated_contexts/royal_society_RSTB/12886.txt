However, a recent study using tokens, showed
risk-seeking attitudes comparable to that observed using pri-
mary reward [96]. Furthermore, when tokens are used, they
are almost immediately changed against primary reward,
making them not really comparable to money, whose value is
much more permanent. Taken together, the available evidence
suggests that the primary /secondary reward dichotomy does
not explain the fact that human description-based biases are
hardly observed in monkeys. Second, in addition to the difference in the nature of the
reward, description-based paradigms in humans and para-
digms in monkeys often present a systematic difference in
the amount of the reward (figure 4). Indeed, most of the orig-
inal studies about PT used hypothetical gambles of hundreds
of dollars and the same biases have been replicated using real
stakes of about a monthâ€™s salary [111].
