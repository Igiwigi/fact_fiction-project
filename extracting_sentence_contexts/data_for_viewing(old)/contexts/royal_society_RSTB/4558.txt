Concerning the ovuliferous scale of Conifers, the conclusion is in favour of the
brachyblast theory.

No definite conclusion is expressed on the question as to whether the Conifers
ultimately arose from microphyllous or megaphyllous (fern-like) ancestors, for,
although the author confidently believes that they arose from Cordaitalean ancestors,
the origin of the Cordaitales themselves from a megaphyllous (fern-like) stock is still
considered to be “ not proven” on the existing evidence.

Emphasis has been laid upon certain facts of a negative character, which are—
pending further evidence—regarded as obstacles in the way of an unqualified
acceptance of the megaphyllous theory. Of these facts, special importance is
attached to a sharp differentiation that exists between those Gymnosperms (Cycadales,
Pteridosperms) in which the seed is clearly borne upon a leaf, and those (Cordaitales,
Ginkgoales, Taxales, Coniferales) in which it is either clearly borne directly upon an
axis (Cordaitales, Taxus), or upon an organ which is probably some modification of
an axis (Conifers, Ginkgo, etc.). For these two divisions of Gymnosperms, the
author proposes the names Phyllosperms (with leaf-borne seeds) and Stachyosperms
(with stem-borne seeds) respectively. It is argued that the Cordaitales, being
Stachyosperms, cannot have arisen from Phyllosperm ancestors, unless there existed
forms which bridge up this and other apparently wide gaps between the two |
divisions ; and of the existence of these intermediate forms there is at present no
evidence.
