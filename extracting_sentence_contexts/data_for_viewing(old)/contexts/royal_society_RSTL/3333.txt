and first as to the best materials for constructing the reflecting surface. On this sub-
ject many experiments haye been tried, but upon the whole I have little to add to
what is generally known : tin and copper, the materials employed by Ngwrox in the

first reflecting telescope, are preferable to any other with which I am acquainted ;
the best proportions being four atoms of copper to one of tin (Turxer's numbers), in
fact, 126-4 parts of copper to 58'9 of tin. This alloy, however, as well as every speci-
men of speculum metal I have ever examined, is visibly porous when carefully tested
with a microscope ; a very high power is not necessary : CopDINGTON's microscope,
even with its lowest power, is generally sufficient ; with his highest power always s0.
When the copper is very impure, and the alloy has been much heated, then the pores
are often easily perceptible to the naked eye: contrary, however, to what might have
been inferred from this, by making the copper and tin chemically pure, we do not
get rid of them altogether ; pores can still be detected by the microscope, even when
the metal has been melted at the lowest temperature. Good cast steel is free from
pores, but cannot be hardened without cracking when of considerable dimensions :
all copper is, I believe, porous, tin not s0.

Newrox, with his usual acuteness, observed this porousness in speculum metal, and
