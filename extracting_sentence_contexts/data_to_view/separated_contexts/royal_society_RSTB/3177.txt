CopELAND’s tube is merely a modification of that described by Jamiy,t and in
a similar tube set up by SrraspurGER{ the water rose with progressively increasing
slowness, requiring 100 days to attain a height of 301 centims. The resistance to flow
through a tube filled with plaster of paris is enormously greater than through the
vessels of a stem, and the osmotic cell used by CopELanp was incapable of developing
a sufficient osmotic force to draw water at an appreciable rate through his tube, even
if this enormous tension could have been transmitted through the water (and
air-bubbles) in the plaster of paris. In fact, if CopELanpd had removed the osmotic
cell and the upper 9 metres of his apparatus, he would have obtained precisely the
same results as when they were present. D1rxon has shown§ that CorpELANp’s tube,
under a head of 122 centims. Hg, would not transmit 1 cub. centim. per annum,

As was perhaps first.clearly shown by ScHwENDENER,|| the vessels of actively
transpiring wood do not contain continuous water columns, but always contain
varying numbers of air-bubbles. ‘This statement has been’ confirmed by all
subsequent observers, and no theory of the ascent of sap is worthy of a moment's
consideration which does not take this fact into account.
