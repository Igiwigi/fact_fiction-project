excitatory, the firing behaviour of the neurons much resembles that emerging in the presence of
electrical autapse. Due to this fact, the obtained Q value is so close to the one obtained in the
presence of electrical autapse.

In figure 12, we present the dependence of the propagation of pacemaker rhythm on the
probability of adding a link at three different chaotic current intensities for all the types of
autapses. As shown in figure 12, for each autapse type, the Q exhibits similar trends depending on
p at each of the chaotic current intensity. Namely, the Q exhibits a resonance-like dependence on
p, implying the presence of an optimal network topology for each chaotic current intensity. While
for a small chaotic current intensity (« = 0.3), the Q exhibits a small resonance peak at around
p = 0.025 in the case of both electrical and excitatory autapse, the resonance disappears in the case
of inhibitory autapse. For all types of autapses, the Q achieves its peak values at p=0.1 and at
p =0.2, for moderate (¢ = 0.75) and for strong (¢ = 1.05) chaotic current intensities, respectively.
When compared to the case without autapse (dashed lines), it is seen that the presence of an
