which it introduces into many difficult investigations. There is an operation, if I
may 80 call it, of constant occurrence in Geometry and Physics, which consists in
the translation of a directed magnitude, that is, the parallel motion of a magnitude
Possessing the property of direction, such, for example, as a force, a velocity, traced
line, or the like. This translation, as it may be easily shown, is always an operation

of the kind called © distributive,” and from its distributiveness all its properties in a
great measure follow as necessary consequences. Now this is a fact of great import-
ance to be borne in mind, a thing to which the truly mathematical adage © when
found make a note of” fully applies. There is no notation actually in use for this
purpose; but there are two nearly obsolete signs, which by an easy and natural
generalization, and according to the most approved rules of mathematical interpreta-
tion, might be made to serve effectually as representatives of the effects produced
generally by the translation of a directed magnitude. My design, in what follows,
is to show this, and establish the laws according to which these signs are to be used
in their enlarged signification. Afterwards I shall endeayour to justify the proposed
innovation, if such it is to be considered, by showing its utility in a variety of cases.
(2.) Instances which suggest the proposed symbolization—There are three ele-
mentary conceptions which have suggested to my mind the principles which it is the
object of this paper to develope, and they will serve here as means of introducing
