given Equation. By ArTuuR CAYLEY, £8g., F.R.S.

IT is easy to 8ee that for an equation of the order n, the product of the differences of
x all but one of the roots will be determined by an equation of the order n, the coefficients
& of which are alternately rational functions of the coefficients of the original equation,
E and rational functions multiplied by the square root of the discriminant. In fact, if the
= = equation be @y=(a, ...Jv, 1)*=a(v—e)(v—P)..., then putting for the moment a=1, and
Z disregarding numerical factors, xD, the square root of the discriminant, is equal to
= the product of the differences of the roots, and @'s is equal to (&—B)(@—y)..., con-
2 8equently the product of the differences of the roots, all but «, is equal to MN O—gs,

: and the expressio0n T is the root of an equation of the order n, the coefficients of which

2 are rational functions of the coefficients of the original equation. I propose in the
= present memoir to determine the equation in question for equations of the orders three,
> four, and five: the process employed is similar to that in my memoir © On the Equation
2 of Differences for an Equation of any Order, and in particular for Equations of the
2 Orders Two, Three, Four, and Five*®,” viz. the last coefficient of the given equation is
