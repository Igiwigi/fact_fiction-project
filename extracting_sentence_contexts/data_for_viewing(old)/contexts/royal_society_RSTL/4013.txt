extreme tenuity and perfect transparency, presenting a singular ghost-like appear-

eye situated externally to its prolongation, affords a proof that the epipolic dispersion
takes place in all directions: but except in this mode of viewing it the rays dispersed
outwards cannot reach the eye, or not. in abundance (for which a very oblique inci-

dence is required), being at such an incidence internally and totally reflected by the
outer surface of the glass. To see this to advantage an eye-tube internally blackened
should be nsed to guard the eye from extraneous light. Such a tube indeed is ge-
nerally advantageous in all these experiments.
If, instead of water, the test cylinder be plunged into a solution of quinine, all
else remaining as before, the blue film in question totally disappears. I tried a great
many other liquids, all in fact which I had at hand in sufficient quantity and colour-

Tess, or but little coloured, in hopes of discovering something which might elucidate
the subject. Strong alcohol, solation of corrosive sublimate, ammonia, &c. acted as
water; allowing the blue film to be seen externally at a perpendicular incidence of
the visnal ray to the surface of the liquid. With strong sulphuric acid, and with
muriate of lime s0 concentrated as to be syrupy, this was not possible, but the film
became visible, and of its full intensity, on moving the eye forward (i. e. towards the
incident light). When snlphate of manganese was used, its delicate pale rose-eo-
lour no way prevented a fine exhibition of the blue film (a point to which I shall have
