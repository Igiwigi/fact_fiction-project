greater part of the side walls of the nasal capsule. Behind the nasal septum, the
interorbital septum (7.s.) is rising up, carrying the preoptic roots of the orbital cartilage
with it. Both the anterior and posterior portions of the orbital cartilages are ex-
panding ; the former (0.c.a.) is spreading out on each side beneath the cerebral hemi-
spheres, while the latter (0.c.p.), attached by the pila antotica to the basal plate, is
spreading out sideways and presents a curvature, being concave towards the now
enormous eye.

The canalicular and cochlear portions of the auditory capsule are now connected
by cartilage, both anteriorly and posteriorly. Between the posterior orbital cartilage,
pila antotica, anterior parachordal, and auditory capsule there is now, therefore, a
deep and wide notch, the incisura antotica, through which all the branches of the
trigeminal nerve emerge. It is important to notice the fact that the pila antotica (p.a.)
here possesses its typical relation, lying in front of all the trigeminal roots.

The posterior or definitive occipital arch (0.4) is growing upwards and forms a
posterior boundary to the fissura metotica (f.m.), through which the glossopharyngeal,
vagus, and spinal accessory nerves emerge. Opposite the centre of the fissura metotica,
however, and ventral to the canalicular portion of the auditory capsule, an isolated
cartilage has made its appearance ; following Sontms this may be called the metotic
cartilage (me.c.). Sontes has no explanation to offer regarding the nature of this
cartilage, but it seems to be developed in connexion with the cranial ribs, to which
attention must now be turned.

At this stage of development in the duck, 4 cranial ribs can be recognized on each
