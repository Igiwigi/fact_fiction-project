Calcium carbonate monohydrate is moderately stable and can be dried at 100° G with
very little decomposition. It decomposes slowly at room temperature; after one year at

about 20° C a little of the monohydrate could still be detected in one sample by X-ray
methods.

(b) Formation of calcium carbonate hexahydrate

If the conditions of the experiment just described were modified slightly, different
reaction products were liable to appear, and in fact it was rarely possible to obtain exactly
the same results even in repeat experiments just in this region. At appreciably higher or
lower temperatures, however, reproducible but quite different results were obtained. Thus
at —10° C well-formed crystals of calcium carbonate hexahydrate were regularly produced.

It was found possible to obtain a Debye-Scherrer photograph of calcium carbonate
hexahydrate, in spite of its tendency to decompose, by using a sample consisting of well-
formed crystals which had been carefully dried by filter paper at low temperature, and by
working quickly. The results are given in table 5 (p. 156).
