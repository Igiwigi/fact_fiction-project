B, 1898, 160). One effect frequently observed in pseudaconitine poisoning (and also
in that of aconitine, though it has not been specially mentioned in the paper just
referred to) is that after partial poisoning, when vagus stimulation has corrected
the disordered sequence of the walls of the heart chambers, and so for the moment
re-established more effective circulation, the auricle in presence of the exhausted
state of the inhibitory apparatus (brought about by prolonged stimulation) becomes
very rapid, whilst the ventricle lapses into movements more vermicular and inco-
ordinate than it showed before. That pseudaconitine renders the inhibitory
apparatus more excitable in the first instance appears probable from the fact that
a stimulation, ineffective before injection, becomes, to a greater or lesser extent,
effective subsequently. That is, however, only a transitory phenomenon. When, as
is frequently the case, the auricles are beating more rapidly than the sinus venosus,
vagus stimulation at first establishes sequence between them, but ultimately the
auricles break away into a more rapid rhythm of their own,

Ultimately the inhibitory action of the vagus upon the ventricle is lost.
