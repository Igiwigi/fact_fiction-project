sint each bundle undergoes a division into three. One branch, the most
the trio, continues its course through the disc; the two others are given
inner side, towards the axis, and supply two sporangiophores (compare
d 56, on Plate 85). The external branch in each case runs straight out
e dise into one of the free bracts, each of which always contains a slender
bundle, a fact which has been previously overlooked. ndle-system of the appendages then, is clear; each bract receives a single
om the axis; immediately on entering the verticil the bundle gives off two
â€˜in an upward and inward direction. These branches constitute the bundles
) sporangiophores corresponding to the bract in question.
