to-day work did not require previous epidemiological experience. Overall, RAMP provided more
than 15 person-years of postdoctoral-level support to the existing UK epidemiology community.
Since this occurred during lockdown with work from home, there was no additional HR or
infrastructure cost and most of the volunteers were able to redeploy research computing resources
to modelling the epidemic.

Another challenge was dealing with the deluge of unrefereed preprints which appeared
describing work on the pandemic. RAMP adopted a two-level approach to this task. The
‘crowdsourced review system’ was based on a bulletin board set up by EPCC at the University
of Edinburgh (the RAMP Forums). This allowed all RAMP volunteers, among others, to post
unsolicited reviews of preprints. Unlike conventional reviewing, this process was transparent and
turned out to be generally more constructive than is often the case in traditional publishing; this
could be due to the fact that reviewers themselves chose papers they were interested in reviewing.
Most of these reviews were by experienced reviewers from outside the epidemiological
community, who were able to assess the scientific methodology and statistical significance of
the claims made. By this stage, everyone was also well acquainted with what was important
for policy. Alongside the Forums, but separate from them, RAMP introduced a Rapid Review
system, which functioned essentially like a journal review system.” This sourced peer review
in the traditional journal style for preprints passed upwards from the ‘crowdsourced review’ or
downwards from SPI-M, Public Health England and UKHSA. Preprints were reviewed for both
correctness and relevance to the ongoing epidemic. Significant code reviews were also undertaken
by this route.

Peer review has always been an unrewarded activity for academics, but the character of the
emergency, combined with the convening power of the Royal Society, meant that it proved easy
