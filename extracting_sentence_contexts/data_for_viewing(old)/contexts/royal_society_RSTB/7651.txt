evolutionary forces were temporarily checked and turned in, as it were, upon the individual.
No new and virile stocks arose at this time whose descendants would mould the shape of
future faunas. The Middle and Upper Bathonian ammonites with their physical peculiarities
were mostly the last of their lines, and they inhabited a restricted area. All this contrasts
with the Bajocian and Lower Callovian, which were times of paedomorphosis, or evolu-
tionary virility and enterprise, world-wide colonization by the race, and vigorous shell-
formation by the individual.

Arabia, therefore, with Sinai, during the Lower and Middle Jurassic formed part
of a region where the periods of ammonite colonization seem to have alternated with
those in other regions. The normal invaders of most parts of the world were excluded;
ammonites that are among the least conspicuous elsewhere entered and flourished, pro-
ducing extraordinary aberrant forms. This curious fact suggests that Arabia formed part
of a region which had a tectonic history opposite or complementary to that normal for
the better-known sedimentary basins of the world in the Jurassic. Transgressions round
the Arabo-Nubian massif and into the Tuwaiq bay perhaps coincided with regressions in
the old classic regions of Europe and elsewhere.

The Middle East was a region also characterized by pseudoceratites in the Cretaceous.
In fact all the Cretaceous ammonites so far collected by the geologists of the Arabian
American Oil Co. in Central Arabia are pseudoceratites. Mr C. W. Wright has identified
them with various genera ranging from Albian to Maestrichtian. The pseudoceratites of
Egypt and Sinai belonging to these periods have long been known. Mme Basse (1940),
in describing those of the Albian of Syria and the Lebanon, attributes their distribution
to climatic causes. She regards them as inhabiting a narrow belt round the earth,
