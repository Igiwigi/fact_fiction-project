Figure 4. Processing of EU-OFDM frames T to extract layers. P indicates a sub-frame carrying the positive parts of the signal;
N indicates a frame carrying the inverted negative parts (so they are now positive). The fact that the frames of deeper layers
are repeated allows the deeper layers to be discarded by time domain subtraction of adjacent frames, and also a bipolar signal;
e.g. subtracting frame T1 from frame TO provides Layer 1's bipolar signal P11-N11. (Online version in colour.)

of the data of the equivalent DCO-OFDM on Layer 1, 25% on Layer 2, 12.5% on Layer 3, etc.,
which gives diminishing returns in spectral efficiency, at a cost of more processing every time a
layer is added. The advantage of using multiple layers is that all layers can use power-efficient
modulation, such as QAM with clipping; this leads to the lowest SNR requirements of all schemes.

(a) Enhanced unipolar orthogonal frequency division multiplexing

Enhanced unipolar orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (EU-OFDM) [29] uses the
superposition of time domain signals at various layers (called ‘depths’), where each U-OFDM
