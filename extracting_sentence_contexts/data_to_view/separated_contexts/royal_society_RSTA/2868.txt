It does so in respect of persons (including companies), not in respect of
technologies. This is because the levers which the law uses to control or influence behaviour, such
as awarding compensation or imposing fines or imprisonment, can only be applied to persons. Law and regulation which appears to be about technology is in fact always about the behaviour
of persons responsible for that technology. Some areas where AI technologies are likely to prove useful have tailored responsibility
schemes, for instance, nuclear power [12], and here it will be up to the legislator or regulator
to modify the scheme appropriately. But most activities fall within the general scheme of
liability law.
