The donors first attended
the aggression induction session, and 1-16 days later, a non-
emotional control session. Within the aggression condition, partici-
pants were exposed to the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm
(PSAP [25,26]). Within this game, the participantsâ€™ task is to collect
as many points as possible via button presses, while a fictitious
opponent simultaneously is stealing these points. Participants can
choose between three behavioural strategies, one of which is related
to overt aggressive behaviour against their opponent. In the control
session, the PSAP was replaced by a construction computer game.
