In the
boundary between ED and ID, the experimental data of [23], denoted by cyan circles, exhibit
a strong variety of co-existing elastic and inertial instabilities. The boundaries between ED and
INT on the other hand are not very clear, as interpenetrating areas exist: the FP also appears at
moderate elasticities (E! < 1) and close to the semi-dilute regime (f > 1). This fact may suggest


that the weak polymer entanglement without substantial shear thinning, normally obtained for
PAAM solutions, can enhance the elastic behaviour of the fluids. Another explanation is due to
the different methods and inconsistencies in the definition of polymer relaxation time and El. The
graph also implies the existence of a triple co-dimension point (TP) in the chart at which there is
a balance among inertial, elastic and shear-thinning effects.
