CHARLES G. BARKLA ON POLARISED RONTGEN RADIATION.

for separate investigation and will not be treated in this paper. It seemed possible
that phenomena of exactly the same nature take place in gases, for the fact of
ionization implies the emission of negative corpuscles or electrons such as proceed
from metals, and, as has been shown, the non-deviable radiation from gases does
differ to a small extent from the primary radiation producing it. It had to be proved
that the difference in the behaviour of gases and heavy solids is not one of degree
merely. As explained by Professor J.
