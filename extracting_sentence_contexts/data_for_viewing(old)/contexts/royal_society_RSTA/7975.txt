(7) Aldehydes did not increase the quantity of “ peroxides” obtained, nor the
tendency to “knock” ; neither did hydrogen.

PART II— ESTIMATION OF NITROGEN PEROXIDE

1— INTRODUCTION

The estimation of the aldehyde and “ peroxide” content of the sample gas
described in Part I indicated that the ‘“‘ peroxides ” were formed before inflamma-
tion, and that the occurrence of “‘ knock ”’ was in some way related to them ; for
the amount of such “ peroxides ” was greater under knocking conditions. Hardly
any “ peroxides ” were found using benzole ; in fact, benzole appeared to destroy
them. Since nitrogen peroxide could be detected by the Griess reagent in that part
of the stroke where no “ peroxides ”’ affecting potassium iodide were obtained, the
pronounced maximum in the “ peroxide”’ curve did not seem to be connected
with the formation of NO,. The effect of the addition of aldehydes, however,
seemed to prove that the “ peroxides ” were not formed as a result of the oxidation
of aldehydes. It was also observed that the quantity of ‘‘ peroxide ’’ appeared to
decrease as the distance from the sampling valve increased. Further experiments
