§4, Application To SyMMETRIC FUNCTIONS. Scuur-Functions.*—Consider the symmetric functions of the n-quantities

Lis) Gay sey) ns
The commonly defined symmetric functions are the following :
(1) 8, == ay’,
(2) a, = the sum of the products of r different 2's,
(3) h, — the sum of the homogeneous products of weight 7.} The properties of these functions and the relations between them have been studied
by MacManon,t who also defines “ new ” symmetric functions.§ These have properties
analogous to the Scuur-functions which we shall define in this paper, and are in fact
linear functions of the Scuur-functions. The Scuur-functions are, however, more
fundamental and have considerable advantages over the functions of MacMauon, as
will be shown. Represent by [Z,] the matrix
