(c) Four miles N.N.E. of Mt. Tangorin in the Hunter River District, N.S.W. Found
im situ in a decomposed fresh-water conglomerate of the Kuttung Series at a
horizon at least 2,000 feet above the base of the series. According to Sir Epar-
wortH Davin the horizon is probably Lower Carboniferous. (In all probability
(b) also belongs to the same horizon.)

(2) Lyndon, south of Eccleston, Allyn River, N.S.W. Not in situ, but probably
from the Kcuttung Series (Carboniferous).

Reconstruction.

No really satisfactory picture of the habit of a plant can be formed without some
acquaintance with the foliage. But with the facts at our disposal it is none the less
worth while to attempt such a reconstruction.

We have seen that the false stem was probably of large diameter and that it stood
erect. The formation of such a composite stem, with a peripheral zone consisting of
petioles and roots, would enable the individual leaf-bearing stems to attain a much
greater height than they could have done had they stood independently. Nor could
leaf-bearing stems of such modest dimensions have supported by themselves leaves
of the size suggested by the petioles alone (even apart from the question of the weight
of a lamina, whose existence we have, I think, no reason to doubt).

â€˜The petioles in the peripheral zone of the trunk have their bundles placed tangentially,
as if the leaves were borne in several cycles round a single central stem. It is clear that
