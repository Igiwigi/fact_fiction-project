only —6 ppm with a conservative uncertainty of 6 ppm.

Because the second term in equation (2.1) does not contain the modulus of elasticity, it should
be independent of material properties and thus lossless. We confirmed this in experiments [8]
in which we showed that under heavy load, in which the second gravitational term represented
nearly 99% of the restoring torque, it was possible to make a torsion balance supporting a load
of 10kg having a period of 18 s with a Q of 1.24 x 10°. This was only slightly below the expected
value, the difference being attributable to losses at the ends, which were not optimally designed,
and residual viscous damping in the vacuum that we could achieve. We also note that the
time-dependent relaxation after deflection of a torsion balance, the anelastic after-effect, is also
proportional to A [7,12].

The origin of the second, gravitational term is the fact that as the torsion strip turns the
lower end rises. The potential energy thus gained supplies the restoring torque. For an angular
deflection 6, the potential energy of the suspended mass, Mp, increases by an amount given by
