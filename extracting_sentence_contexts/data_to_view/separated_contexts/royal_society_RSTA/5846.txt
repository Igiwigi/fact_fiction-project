In combination with (2.4) which holds for strong vanishing viscosity limits, proposition 2.2
constitutes precise versions of the celebrated Kolmogorov 4/5 and 4/3-laws (upon setting d=3

in (2.7)):

Diyslul = elu), Diyalu] =â€”Setu (28)

-TaS +2)

Equation (2.8) is a rigorous version of (1.9). It should be noted that the above relationships are
local in that they hold in the sense of space-time distributions. Moreover, they show that the
fluxes Dj/5[u] and Dj/3[u/] are, in fact, non-positive as distributions, implying a form of skewness
of the velocity field. Now, for any weak Euler solution of class L3(0, T;L? (T4)), the inertial dissipation D[u] must be 8 |
finite upon averaging in space time. However, it need not be signed.
