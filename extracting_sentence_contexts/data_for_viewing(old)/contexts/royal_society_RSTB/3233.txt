be found in and about the frontal region, and have already been exposed in treating
of the glabella (p. 284); the resemblances extend to the calottal height and its
index, ScHWALBE's angle, the bregma index, the frontal, orbito-frontal, superior and
inferior inion angles, and the fronto-parietal index, as well as to many other
characters of subordinate importance. The gap, indeed, could never have seemed so
impassable if comparison had not been made too exclusively with European races.

The possession, however, of a number of characters in common by no means
implies of necessity that the Australian and Neandertal men are to be assigned to
the same race; such characters may have appertained to all very primitive people,
and as yet we have not made acquaintance with the features of the face, without
a knowledge of which it would be premature to form a final judgment on this
point. Nor must the fact be overlooked that so far we have confined our attention
to the evidence provided by a single skull; this is a defect which we must now
proceed to remedy.

The collection of South Australian skulls in the University Museum numbers some
12 specimens, picked up at random by different observers at various localities in
Victoria ; eight of them are skulls of men, three of women, and one of a youth of
about 14 years of age ; the male skulls may be considered separately.

As a preliminary, we must first consider our choice of a base, and this renders it
necessary to discuss the significance of the nasi-inion line. The inion is a feature
which owes the greater part of its importance to the fact that by a piece of
extraordinary good fortune it is preserved in the Neandertal calotte, and thus
