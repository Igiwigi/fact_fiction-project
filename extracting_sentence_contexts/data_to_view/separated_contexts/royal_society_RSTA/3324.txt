The results, however, rule
out this possibility. For ZrO, we have no evidence of the formation of Zr*+ ions when Ru atoms
or clusters are deposited on the surface. This is consistent with the fact that TiO2 is more reducible
than ZrO. However, the general conclusion is that direct reduction of the TiO or ZrOz supports
does not occur by simple deposition of the Ru metal. We have also considered an alternative process, reduction of the oxide by the effect of an
oxygen reverse spillover.
