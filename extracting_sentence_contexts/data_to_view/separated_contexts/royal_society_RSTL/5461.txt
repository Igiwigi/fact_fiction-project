This experiment recalls that made on the electric organ of the
Gymnotus or the 'Torpedo, by employing strata of various lengths of this organ. I think.
that, notwithstanding our ignorance as to the form of the electromotive element of
muscles, this proposition leads us to believe that muscular fibre acts as a reunion or
8eries of electromotive elements. This proposition furnishes a clear explanation of several important facts of muscular
electricity. The first of these facts is, that a differential current takes place constantly on
closing the circuit with the gastrocnemius of a frog united with its half-thigh, the current
being determined by the gastrocnemins. The experiment succeeds equally, if, instead of
leaving the tendon attached to the gastrocnemius, the latter is cut transyersely: in all cases
it is essential that one of the muscles be longer than the other, so that either the gastro-
enemius or the half-thigh may predominate.
