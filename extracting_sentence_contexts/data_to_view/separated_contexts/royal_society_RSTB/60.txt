were applied to the excised heart just as in Arpy’s experiment they are applied to
voluntary muscle. It will be well to give separately (a) the results we obtained upon
the quiescent heart by excitation nearer to one or other of our levers; (b) the results
we obtained on spontaneously beating hearts. (a.) Excitation of a quiescent heart, upon which rested the two levers of our double
cardiograph, at once revealed the fact that the total coordinated contraction of the

fine measurements of time, which indeed we did not require,
