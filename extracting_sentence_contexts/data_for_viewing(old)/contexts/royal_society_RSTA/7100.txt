A photomicrograph of the track formed with paraffin oil as lubricant is shown by
the arrow in figure 1d. The magnification is 50. With the other oils essentially similar
tracks were obtained. It will be seen that with paraffin oil a well-marked track is cut
in the lower surface. This track is similar to, but somewhat smaller than, that observed
with unlubricated metals.

The fluctuations in the frictional force between the surfaces would be expected to
give rise to corresponding fluctuations in the surface temperature. To test this experi-
mentally the surface temperature was measured by the thermoelectric method, as
described in earlier papers. Figure le shows the results obtained for constantan sliding
on steel with paraffin oil as lubricant. It will be seen that the surface temperature as
well as the frictional force is in fact fluctuating violently during sliding. During the
stick the surface temperature remains sensibly constant, but at the instant a slip occurs
there is a sudden rise and fall in the surface temperature. The whole temperature
flash may be over in less than a thousandth of a second. Similar results were also
obtained in the presence of other lubricants.

Fatty acids

The friction and wear of a series of saturated fatty acids of increasing molecular
weight were examined, and the results are shown in figures 2 and 8 (plate 2).

It was found that with the lower members of the series—acetic, propionic, and
butyric acids—motion proceeded by stick-slips and the behaviour was similar in many
