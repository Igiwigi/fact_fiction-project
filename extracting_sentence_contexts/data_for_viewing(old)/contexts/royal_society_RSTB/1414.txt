was presumably of equal morphological importance ; in the previous cases the bran
were relatively small lateral appendages, and probably of limited duration.

As regards the mode of origin of the branches, we are necessarily without any di
evidence. Now, however, that the continuity between the primary tissue
branch and those of the main stem has been demonstrated, there can be no dou
the ramification took place while the axis was still young. In fact we hav
reason to suppose that the branching was normal, not adventitious, and that the lar
shoots arose, like the normal branches of Hquisetum or any other vascular plan i
the immediate neighbourhood of the growing point. The secondary wood
the base of the branch is imbedded, was evidently deposited after the branch
formed ; the stem and branch together became invested simultaneously by a com
woody zone. In fact the conditions in Calamites are the same as in the brane
any stem with secondary growth in thickness, and present no special difficulties
that the facts are known.

The successive changes in structure which we find in a branch, as we trace ii
its base upwards, have already been described. The changes consist essentially
rapid increase in the diameter of the pith, and in the number of vascular b
surrounding it.

These facts, which have been already demonstrated by the study of spe
showing structure, are exactly reproduced in those medullary casts which re
the pith-cavity of lateral branches. After the fundamental truth had been es a bhine
that the sandstone and other allied specimens, which were long believed to be
