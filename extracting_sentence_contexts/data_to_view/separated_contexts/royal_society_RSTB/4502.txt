As we have learned, the breeding-grounds both of the European and of the
American eel lie west of long. 50° W. Although the larvee of Anguilla rostrata
become far more numerous in proportion from east to west, it is nevertheless a fact
that there are extensive areas where the larvee of the two species are greatly inter-
mingled, The “Dana” stations provide many examples of such intermingling, as
shown in the photograph (Plate 18) and the graph fig. 9. It is very natural then to ask: If the larvee of the two species are found greatly
intermingled in certain areas of the ocean, how is it that the stock of eels in Europe
is, practically speaking, pure, ¢.e., composed exclusively of Anguilla vulgaris, and that
in America of Anguilla rostrata?
