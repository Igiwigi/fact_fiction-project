is perhaps the mos serious of all.

Let A (fig. 2) be a plan of the roller, O being the centre of the disk which is
turning in the direction indicated by the arrow N. Let A Q be the reaction to the
force required to drive the roller round, acting at its periphery at the point of contact
with the disk. This force though small must exist, and the resulb is that the
displacement of the roller when the larger force A P (which is that tending to alter its
position radially on the disk) comes into operation is not radial bub along A R. This
line A R is the direction of the resultant of A P and A Q, and by moving along ib the
roller really sips through a cireumferential distance R P, which represents the actual
error thus introduced into the result. The total error is thus proportional to the
distance moved sideways by the roller, that is, to its transverse displacement. Tt is
this fact which is ignored in the tests of ergometers. The common method of
procedure is to turn the instrument through a certain distance with a load deflecting
the spring to a known and constant amount, and the roller consequently at one radial
position on the disk. This is repeated for various other positions of the roller when
the record of work done is in each case found to be correct, and it is hard to see why
it should be otherwise. These are not, however, the practical conditions of working,
which, as a rule, are totally different. In ergometers and steam engine integrators,
for instance, a continual change takes place in the position of the roller due to
fluctuations of power or steam pressure. This introduces an error in the way
dexcribed which it does not appear possible to allow for even if the law of variation be
known, without elaborate calculation. It certainly would be difficult to tesb an
ergometer or similar instrument with a view to ascertaining and allowing for this
