(d) The effect of high pressure

To the best of the author’s knowledge, there is no report on the indentation behaviour of glass
under hydrostatic pressure although this might open new perspectives in geological sciences
and in vulcanology for instance. All investigations are performed post-decompression and reveal
significant differences in the indentation behaviour after high pressure treatments (typically
larger than 15 GPa) in comparison to the behaviour of the pristine glass (prior to the treatment).
High pressure experiments lead to denser materials (even after unloading), to an extent that
was found to scale with Poisson’s ratio of the glass [38] because of the intimate relationship
existing between v and the atomic packing density [18,43]. Hence, there is less room for further
indentation densification after a high pressure treatment. Both experiments [7] and molecular
dynamic simulation [44] pointed to a shift to more pile-up of matter at the vicinity of the imprint
and thus shear flow after high pressure treatments and, as a matter of fact, v is mostly larger
in the treated glass than in the pristine sample [7]. For instance, in the case of a-SiO,, V+/V—
increases from approximately 0.17 to 0.77 after a treatment at 25GPa for 1h and subsequent
Vickers indentation under 250mN (figure 12) and v increases from 0.15 to approximately 0.252,
