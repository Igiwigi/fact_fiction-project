If the sweet pea be entirely self-
fertilised then we should expect the homotyposis of both ovules and ripe seeds to be
fully up to the average. In neither case is such a result reached, although in one
series we have a value for the ovules higher than that obtained for anything
except the broom. The noteworthy fact, however, is that the results for the two
series of sweet peas differ so widely in character! In the first series it is the
abortion which is most individual in character; in the second series it is the ovules. In the first series the ripe seeds have far less individuality than the aborted seeds,
in fact, the smallest homotyposis I have yet observed ; in the second series the ripe
seeds have a value rising to â€˜2, which is higher than that of the aborted seeds.
