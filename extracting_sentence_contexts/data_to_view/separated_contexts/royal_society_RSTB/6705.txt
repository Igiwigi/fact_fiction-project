They characteristically truncate the spurs between the radial ghauts. Hanging valleys have been locally produced between the truncated spurs (figs. 27, 28,
Plate 5). Davis drew attention to the fact that truncated spurs are characteristic of
most of the islands of the Lesser Antilles (Davis 1926). He thought they were formed
because coral reefs that had once protected the islands from wave erosion, were
destroyed during the Pleistocene Glacial Period. The writer regards the cliffs as due
to marginal submergence and marine erosion (p. 19).
