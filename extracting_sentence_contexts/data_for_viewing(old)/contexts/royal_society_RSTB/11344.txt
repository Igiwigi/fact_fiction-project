could also explain why the residence time of MinE increases
towards the trailing edge of a Min-protein wave [46]. Surpris-
ingly, the same was observed for MinD, suggesting that some
kind of MinD arrays similar to the ones observed on phospho-
lipid vesicles might be present on the support lipid bilayer.
Direct evidence is however lacking.

Some theoretical descriptions had incorporated the possi-
bility of higher order MinD structures on the membrane
[38-40,60] for which there is also some evidence from recon-
stitution experiments [61]. None of these descriptions has
been applied to the geometry of a flat membrane, though.
In fact, essentially only the mechanism introduced in [44]
has been analysed in geometries corresponding to Min pro-
teins on flat membranes. Given the harsh criticism this
model received [62], it is all the more surprising that to our
knowledge no other mechanism is capable of reproducing
the travelling Min-protein waves that were observed
in vitro. In particular, the model by Huang et al. [32], which
is used in many current studies, can to our knowledge not
reproduce any of the patterns observed in the open geometry.

Similar to the patterns in vivo, one can gain further insight
into the patterns in vitro by changing the geometry. One possi-
bility is to prepare membrane patches of various forms and
