One might even be inclined to think that the non-existence of our desired notion
of proof identity is inherently caused by the very nature of proof theory. In this section, I will argue that the problem is a mathematical problem that can be solved
by mathematical means. In fact, there exist already two fundamentally different approaches for

° Although in propositional logic a tableau proof can be seen as an ‘upside-down’ sequent calculus proof, this is no longer the
case for more expressive logics [49]. It seems that we need more sophisticated versions of sequent calculi and tableau systems,
in order to recover this upside-down correspondence.


freeing proofs from the syntactic yoke of proof systems, and both have the potential to enable us
eventually to speak of a theory of proofs, instead of a theory of proof systems. In the first approach, we define the properties of proofs and their interactions via axioms, in a
similar way as it is done in abstract algebra.
