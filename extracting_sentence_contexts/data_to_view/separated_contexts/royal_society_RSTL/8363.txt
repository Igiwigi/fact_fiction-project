For these reasons it does not compare fayourably with the © nitrated”
preparations. Of these, the mixtures with potassium nitrate are 8omewhat the *most readily prepared ; they,
moreover, have but little if any more tendeney to absorb moisture than pure compressed gun-cotton. The con-
siderable advantage which the * nitrated ” gun-cotton possesses in point both of cost and of power (especially
when compared with equal yolumes of compressed gun-cotton), added to the fact that it is as readily susceptible
of ignition by detonation and possesses othor valuable properties aboye pointed out, render it highly probable
that this preparation of gun-cotton will be largely substituted for the ordinary compressed material in many of
its applications. The cireumstance that carbonic oxide, produced in considerable amount upon the explosion of
trinitrocellulose, is present in the products of explosion of nitrated material in scarcely higher proportion than
it exists in those of gunpowder, appears likely to remove the objection against the employment of gun-cotton in
military mines, which arose from the large quantity of carbonie oxide developed when heavy charges of gun-
cotton were exploded,

nitroglycerine, which in no instance detonated compressed gun-cotton, produced detona-
tion of those materials in three out of four instances; in the fourth, with nitrated gun-
cotton, the latter was exploded, but there was no destructive effect exerted upon the
iron plate.
