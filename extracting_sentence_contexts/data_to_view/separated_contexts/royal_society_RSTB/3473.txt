29. From this latter figure, together
with figs. 86 and 37, the asymmetry of the blastoporie aperture may be realised,
as also the fact that it is the apparent right (actual left) horn of the crescentic
opening which is prolonged deeply to form the commencement of the imperfect
blastoporic canal. The other horn and the remainder of the crescentic aperture
form little more than a deep groove continuous with the canal at its mouth. In
the slightly older Specimen E the ecrescentic character of the aperture has entirely
disappeared : the opening is still somewhat asymmetrical, but appears as a somewhat
irregular, single, and approximately medial, depression, though its vestibule is wide
and bears faint traces of its original character (cf. fig. 34).
