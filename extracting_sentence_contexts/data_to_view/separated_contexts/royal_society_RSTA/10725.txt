For equal velocities the destructive effects of the dust cloud must have been con-
siderably greater than that of any wind, for the weight of the mass, or rather its
momentum, is high, owing to the density of the mixture of gases and of dust. This
is much heavier than air, and flows along the ground, but lighter than water, on
which it always floats. There are a few facts which seem to show that the mere weight of the cloud did
much damage, as, for example, that the hatches of the “ Roraima” were stove in.t
We looked in St. Vincent for similar effects, but found none, even on Lot 14, which
was nearest the crater. The roofs had in some cases collapsed, probably with the
weight of ashes which gathered through the night.
