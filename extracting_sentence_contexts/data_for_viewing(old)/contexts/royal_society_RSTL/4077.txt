IN my Treatise upon the Electro-Physiological Phenomena of Animals, at page 230
I have described the following experiment :—© T prepare a frog after the method
adopted by Garvani, separating the junction of the two thigh-bones, and placing
them $0 divided between two glasses, with the claws immersed in these glasses.
Introducing the conductors of a pile of from sixty to eighty pairs in both the glasses,
T pass a current through the frog, which is direct in one limb and inverse in the
other. After a lapse of from fifteen to twenty minutes, I establish a communication
between the glasses by means of a wire, whereupon the limb traversed by the inverse
current immediately contracts. On quickly removing the communicating wire, no
contraction whatever occurs.” I concluded from this experiment that the action of
the electric current, in weakening or destroying the excitability of the nerve, was not
the same whatever were its direction, and that the direct current acted with a much
greater energy than the inverse. This fact appeared to me to be of sufficient import-
ance to warrant further investigation, and I think that the results at which I have
arrived will serve to throw some light upon that difficult s8nbject, the physiological
action of the electric current. I felt convinced, in the first place, that it now behoved
me to employ means for the investigation of these phenomena far more exact than
those I had hitherto resorted to. Every natural philosopher who has ever s0 little
studied the contractions caused by the passage of the electric current upon the nerves
of a frog, prepared for the purpose, must certainly have perceived how very difficult
it is to arrive at satisfactory results, where the force of the contraction excited is to
be judged of by the eye. In this manner our knowledge is limited to the fact, that
when the excitability of the nerve is lessened, the direct current causes contractions
only at the very moment in which it begins to circulate, whilst the inverse current
produces contraction only at the moment of its ceasing to pass. In one word, we
