From figures 17 and 18, it is possible to highlight how the PS polymer shows a lower viscosity 2
ratio with respect to ABS, which, on the other hand, presents an average viscosity nearer to : X
the plateau one. Moreover, it is worth noting how the increase in Reynolds number does not aaa
significantly modify the average distribution of non-dimensional viscosity at the three filling : BS
percentages here analysed. The presence of obstacles or solid boundary tends to deflect the : s
unperturbed flow distribution by generating baffles on non-dimensional viscosity. In fact, the : s
higher viscosity values are located near high curvature areas or edges present in the considered : s

geometry. No particular differences arise in terms of polymer distribution while increasing the
Reynolds number, which is different to what was observed in the previous test-case where a
sort of fingering effect was pretty visible. The mass distribution at the three filling percentages
considered is pretty aligned for both the PS and ABS, a phenomenon which is mainly driven
by the geometry of the porous domain. Finally, the results presented here have been obtained
for relatively low Reynolds number. This is a constraint basically driven by the fluid-dynamics
properties of the compounds analysed. As already stated, the injection moulding is characterized
by low injection velocities (generally below 1m/s), which leads to really low effective Reynolds
numbers. Theoretically speaking, there are no particular limitations imposed by the developed
algorithm, apart from the ones characteristic of the LB framework itself; the upper limit in terms
