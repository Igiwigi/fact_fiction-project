multiplexer units for injecting faults. By analysing the figure, the following observations can be
made:

— SalvageDNN outperforms the state-of-the-art FAP approach in all the cases;

— the accuracy of the systolic arrays containing only C_PEs drops significantly, even at
lower fault rates, as shown in figures 16a,b. This is due to the fact that a PE can
get disconnected due to a fault in its downstream neighbours. Therefore, the average
probability of a PE getting disconnected at a specific fault rate is significantly high in the
arrays composed of C_PEs;

— with an increase in the number of bypass connections in a PE for fault tolerance, the
average DNN accuracy at a specific fault rate increases. For example, this can be observed
by analysing the DNN accuracy in figures 16a,c,e at where 2% of the MAC units are faulty.
The DBNC_PE almost maintains the baseline accuracy whereas the accuracy offered by
C_PE equals 10% (i.e. equivalent to a random selection); and

— the DNN accuracy for the same fault rate increases with the decrease in the size of
the systolic array. This can be observed by comparing figures 16a, 16c and 16e with
