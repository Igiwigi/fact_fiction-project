Second, and in case the languages with strongly cued stress
are feeling smug at having mastered rhythm, once the spotlight
falls on them it reveals they deserve no better than a B- for
effort. The problem stems from that rather neglected aspect
of language, syntagmatic contrastâ€”one which has always
been a fly in the ointment of attempts to impose on the analysis
of speech the kind of cyclicity or rhythmicity of other activities
such as walking or chewing [33]. Spoken English is akin to traf-
fic flow, where we might expect, at any observation point and
moment, an effectively random sequence of lorry-car-car-lorry-
lorry-car-van-lorry-van-car-car-car rather than a rhythmically
alternating lorry-car-lorry-car-lorry-car. This is despite the
fact that a very straightforward way, in addition to developing
strong stress, exists for a language to achieve the putative goal
of contrastive rhythm, namely to incorporate the following into
its phonology: a constraint on stressed syllables all to have the
same structure, e.g. CVV (one consonant plus a long vowel); a
constraint on unstressed syllables all to have the same structure
as each other, e.g. CV (one consonant and a short vowel); and a
constraint on the foot (the domain of a stressed syllable plus
any following unstressed syllables) to be disyllabic. Sadly,
even the languages which know how to recruit prominence
to the goal of contrastive rhythm seem not to have had their
eye on the ball when it comes to regularizing their metrical
properties. So an utterance such as the following has highly
