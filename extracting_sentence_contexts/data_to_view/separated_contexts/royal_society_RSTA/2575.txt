This enters into the model description as sink terms in the conservation of mass, water and
enthalpy [24].

Our results show that the MVP volume fraction needed to form channels is lower taking into

account our improved initial bubble distributions (figure 4a). Owing to the fact that the formation is
of large bubbles is favoured in the best-connected areas of the porous medium, more of the MVP 1S

will be able to participate in the formation of channels. Larger pore spaces contain initially a
higher integrated mass of volatiles accessible for bubble growth than small pores. Larger and
more mobile bubbles are therefore predominantly formed in large and better-connected pore
space leading to a greater efficiency at forming MVP percolating pathways (see figures 2 and 3)

than expected from a random initial distribution of bubbles.
