Disruptive selection in heterogeneous social groups: where individual and social context can drive polymorphism. Like directional selection (equation (III-A)), disruptive selection in heterogeneous social groups combines elements from =
class- and group-structure (i.e. from equation (3.5) and (4.3) [115]). In fact, under the assumption that the expected 8
number of offspring in class i produced by a focal individual in class j with trait z. can be written as wj(z., Z), where <
Z = (2, ...,Zm) collects the average trait Z, among neighbours in class k (ie. under the assumption that individuals play
the field within groups), disruptive selection can be decomposed into

h(z") = Inw(2") + 2r(2”) + 2ig(2"), (IV.A)

(electronic supplementary material, appendix C.2 for our derivation; [115] for derivation with more general fitness function). Briefly, the first term consists of second-order fitness effects weighted by reproductive value and relatedness,
