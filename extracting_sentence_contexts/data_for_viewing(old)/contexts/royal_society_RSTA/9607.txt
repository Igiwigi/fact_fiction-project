sunlight. The cells themselves seem quite stable, for one of them, when exposed
for 30 days to summer daylight, showed no change, beyond the reversible temperature
effect, within the limit of accuracy of our are standardizations. It should be added
that our 1928 potassium arc scale was based upon the constant 40-0 me per 10" amp,
whereas the mean of our recent determinations, more numerous and more precise,
gives 40-7 mc. As regards the newer type selenium cell, W 21931-4, the bare lamp
and m.n.s. standardizations indicate greater red-sensitiveness, but the m.n.s. and

daylight figures are not in so good accord as with W 21104-2. This may very easily
be due to the fact that the curvature correction, as found for the latter, may not
be quite great enough for the former, and so in bright daylight may lead to the not
very important difference found.

We have omitted from the Table III the standardizations of the cuprous oxide
cells in “ mean noon sunlight,” as we found the loss in sensitivity which they undergo
in daylight render them useless for anything but comparative values at one time.
By comparison in daylight on February 26, 1932, we found a cell of this type, kindly
given to us by Dr. P. AuceEr, was highly sensitive and 32-metre candles on the
potassium carbon are scale gave 1:00 wa. This cell had a gold film over the oxide.
A similar cell, by Siemens and Halske, but with a silver film, gave 1-00 ya for 45 me.
The behaviour of these cells has been considered by us in two earlier papers.*
