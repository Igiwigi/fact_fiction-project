gaseous state. This omission is the more to be regretted since great interest attaches
to the determination. Not only is fluorine the first member of an important group of
elements, but its power to retard light, calculated from the refractivities of its
compounds, appears to vary within unusually wide limits, so that the estimates of its
refraction equivalent are singularly discordant, and agree only in showing that it
must be remarkably low.

Thus, Dr. J. H. Guapsronr* originally gave the refraction equivalents of fluorine
and chlorine as 1°4 and 9°9 respectively, figures which correspond to a refractive
index for fluorine of 1°000108, or considerably Jess than that of hydrogen (1:000189).
In 1885+ he placed it at 1°6. In 1886 G. Guapstone{ put down the refraction
equivalent at between 0°3 and 0°8, and in 1891 the same observer, with Dr. J. H.
GLaDstonE,§ estimated it as “extremely small, in fact, less than 1:0.” More recently
Morssan and Dewar,|| judging from the appearance of liquid fluorine, recorded their
belief that the index would be found to be higher than had previously been supposed,
though still low in relation to its atomic weight.

In these circumstances it seemed desirable to attempt to measure the index of the
element in the gaseous state, and with this object Mr. Curnperrson visited Paris in
January, 1904, and, by the kindness of M. Moissan, was enabled to observe the index
of a current of fluorine passing through a small hollow prism of copper, the apertures
of which were covered by plates of fluor spar. A summary of this work has already
