Again, in a rich garden soil, where red clover has been grown for more than thirty
consecutive years, and has yielded throughout good, but gradually much diminishing
crops, it was found, after the first 22 years, that the nitrogen in the surface soil had
been reduced from 0°3095 to 0°3634 per cent., calculated on the soil dried at 100° C.

Eyen in an actual course of rotation, of turnips, barley, clover or beans, and wheat,
with mineral, but without nitrogenous manure, the percentage of nitrogen in the
surface soil has been much reduced; whilst in a parallel rotation in which fallow
takes the place of the clover or beans, the reduction is still greater. Thus, in all the cases cited, including gramineous, cruciferous, chenopodiaceous, and
even leguminous crops, and a rotation of crops, when each has been grown for many
years in succession without nitrogenous manure, and has yielded comparatively small
and declining amounts of nitrogen in the crops, there has, coincidently, been a
considerable reduction in the amount of nitrogen in the surface soil. There has, in
fact, not been compensation from the free nitrogen of the air, or at any rate not at all
in amount corresponding to the annual losses. Lastly, grass land which, under the influence of a full mineral manure, including
potash, but without any supply of nitrogen for more than thirty years, has grown
crops containing large amounts of comparatively superficially rooting leguminous
herbage, succeeded by increased amounts of gramineous herbage, has, under those
conditions, yielded about the same amount of nitrogen per acre as M. BerrHetor
assumes to be the average produce of a meadow; but it has done so only with
coincident great reduction in the nitrogen of the surface soil. Whether, therefore, we consider the facts of agriculture generally, or confine
attention to special cases under known experimental conditions, the evidence does not
favour the supposition that a balance is maintained by the restoration of nitrogen

from the large store of it existing in the free state in the atmosphere.
