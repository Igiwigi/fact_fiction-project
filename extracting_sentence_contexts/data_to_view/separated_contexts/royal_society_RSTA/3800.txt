We thus have an equation for Bo, and the
required root is that which vanishes when 8 vanishes. For the harmonies of degrees 0, 1, 2, 3, and for all orders, o may be found
rigorously in algebraic form, but for higher degrees the equation can only be solved
approximately, unless 8 should have a definite numerical value. When Bo has been determined, either rigorously or approximately, the successive
coefticients of the series are determinable in such a way that the ratio of each
coeflicient to the preceding one is expressed by a continued fraction, which is, in fact,
a portion of one of the two fractions involved in the equation for Bo. Throughout the rest of the paper the greater part of the work is carried out
with approximate forms, and, although it would be easy to attain to greater
accuracy, Ihave thought it sufticient, in the first instance, to stop at 8Â°. With this
