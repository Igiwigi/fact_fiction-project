They are kept separate by partitions connected with a vertical wall, into which
slabs of stone (which may be removed) are cemented. The springs are called La
Reine, La Grotte Sup6rieure, La Source aux Yeux, La Blanche, and La Froide ; but
all of these, excepting the two first, are apt to mix with one another; and I even
learned that such a mixture was practised in order to give a greater apparent supply
to some of the more esteemed of the springs. It is quite certain too that rain water
mixes with some of these, which with other facts immediately to be noticed, render
observyations of temperature here of little avail. My obseryations were made on the
Springs as they flowed from beneath the wall just mentioned. These springs are
highly sulphureous, and the two whose temperature T measured were copious.
