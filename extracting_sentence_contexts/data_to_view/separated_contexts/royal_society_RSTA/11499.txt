The sum of the four angles of the plane quadrilateral, s uw y of fig. 1,
is constant. Law II. has to do with the proportions necessary to admit of the complete rotation
of one link relatively to the next in sequence. It rests on the established fact that
one side of a triangle cannot be greater than the sum of the other two. The expres-
sion of this law will be given later. In fig. 1 suppose the links V and Z to be capable of turning continuously around
relatively to T in the direction of the arrow, then, with every revolution, the angle
at s may be regurded as having been increased by the amount of 2a, and when, in the
movement, the angle between the two links V and T is reduced to zero by w
coinciding with w,, further movement in the same direction may be regarded as

causing the angle to become negative.
Â® Regarded in this way Law I. will still hold good, the sum of the four angles
estimated from any initial position will be constant.
