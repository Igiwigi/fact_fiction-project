Lest it be objected that the assumption of these values is, in effect, ‘an assumption of
the result which it is the whole object of the work to obtain, it is pointed out that for
the purpose of applying the method of coincidences of fractions, which is the only
use to which these assumed values are put, it is only the ratios of these values which
need to be known with high accuracy, a quite moderate accuracy being sufficient as
regards their absolute values. And it may be emphasised that as regards the values
quoted, other than the first, it is, in fact, the ratios of these to the first, and not their
absolute values, which have been the direct subject of highly accurate experimental
determinations by previous observers. For the purpose in view an accuracy of 1 part in

5 millions in the values of the ratios would be amply sufficient, and the ratios are known
to be established to well within this accuracy. As regards the absolute value for the
red radiation of cadmium, this is only required for the ascertainment of a first approxi-
mate value of the whole number of such wave-lengths in the double length of the first
