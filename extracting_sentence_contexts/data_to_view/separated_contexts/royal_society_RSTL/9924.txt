Tt is a huge plate bent upon itself at
2A right angle; the ascending part is half the size of the lower region, and whilst
Zovered by the facial © pavement,” itself covers the hyomandibular and symplectic ; that
is pointed above. The lower region of the bone is a large externally ganoid tract,
DHointed in front, ear-shaped behind, hollow within, and coiled inwards. Behind the
Fact pavement, and articulated by a cup-like facet to the © opercular process ” of the
Ayomandibular, is the opercular bone ; it is four-sided, but narrow above where it
Srticulates with the post-temporal. Tts broad lower edge is toothed and overlaps the
Subopereular ; its hind face is free and forms the upper half of the free edge of the
Eperculum. The © sabopercular” forms the lower half of that edge ; it is a broad plate
ith a rounded lower and hinder margin, and is uncinate in front and above, where
It is wedged in between the interopercular and opercular.
