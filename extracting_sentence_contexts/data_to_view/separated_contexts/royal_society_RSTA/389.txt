A second merit is that the efficacy of
forcings varies from one forcing mechanism to another [66]; so it is useful to use the forcing
mechanism of greatest interest. Finally, the 4Wm~? CO) forcing avoids the uncertainty in the
exact magnitude of a doubled CO} forcing [1,48] estimate of 3.7 W m ~ for doubled CO2, whereas
Hansen et al. [66] obtain 4.1 W m~?, as well as problems associated with the fact that a doubled
COy forcing varies as the CO2 amount changes (the assumption that each CO2 doubling has the
same forcing is meant to approximate the effect of CO? absorption line saturation, but actually
the forcing per doubling increases as CO? increases [66,85]). Climate feedbacks are the core of the climate problem. Climate feedbacks can be confusing,
because in climate analyses what is sometimes a climate forcing is at other times a climate
feedback.
