a harmonic oscillator is known to carry a zero-pointy energy and to appear with a fluctuating
amplitude. An antenna put in a vacuum would pick up noise that could be attributed to the
fluctuating amplitudes of the modes it samples. The physics of the quantum vacuum has been
well tested and explains a huge set of phenomena, from the stickiness of materials on the
nanoscale to the rise of water in capillaries [13] that limits the height of trees [14]. Recent
precision measurements of vacuum forces [15] including measurements of repulsive forces [16,17]
have tested the theory with an accuracy only limited by the knowledge of the material data
involved. Zel’dovich’s proposal [10] thus connects the cosmological constant to a range of
completely different phenomena, which would give great strength to his theory. Unfortunately,
while Zel’dovich derived the correct structure of the cosmological term, the predicted quantitative
value for A is in stark disagreement with the facts.

The facts are that the universe is indeed dominated by vacuum fluctuations, simply because
it is rather empty, and that the spectrum of these fluctuations is almost unlimited, because of the
equivalence principle of general relativity [2]. The emptiness of space is quantified in the number
for the average mass density of space on cosmological scales at the present time:

The equivalence principle [2] states that gravity acts equally on all bodies and on all scales. In
particular, it implies that gravity acts equally on all fields on all wavelengths, down to the Planck
scale where—presumably—classical general relativity [2] no longer holds. The equivalence
principle has been well tested, although not to the Planck scale, but it is a principle that connects
a wide range of gravitational phenomena and therefore seems to capture a significant portion
of the truth. The potential limitation of the principle is characterized by two numbers worth
