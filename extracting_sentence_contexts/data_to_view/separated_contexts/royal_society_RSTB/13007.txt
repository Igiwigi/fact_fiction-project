A recent study using R. speratus revealed
employing other signals to control reproduction. The transcrip- that the royal chambers in termite nests were hypoxic (low in
tion factor termed carbohydrate-responsive element-binding Oz; approximately 15%) and hypercapnic (high in CO3;
protein (ChREBP), a glucose sensor regulating the expression approximately 4%) [44]. Oxidative stress is influenced by

of genes that drive fatty acid biosynthesis, was highly expressed the level of O2 present, shown by the fact that increases in


the level of O2 in the atmosphere that the insects are breath-
ing lead to enhanced rates of oxidative damage and reduced
longevity [102]. Atmospheric O2 can be toxic and the levels
must be carefully regulated to avoid oxidative stress [103]. Indeed, the discontinuous gas-exchange cycle is known as a
respiratory adaptation to avoid oxygen toxicity in insects
[104] (also in a termite Zootermopsis nevadensis [105]).
