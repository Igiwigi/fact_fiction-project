§ 2. An aneroid is usually graduated by direct reference to a mereury gauge during
a reduction of pressure. An examination, made under the same conditions as the
graduation, tests the accuracy of the workman, but not necessarily the quality of the
instrument. That something more is desirable becomes obvious, when, after reducing
the pressure several inches, one keeps it constant and continues comparative readings
of the gauge and aneroid for some time. A gradual fall in the readings of the latter

soon becomes apparent, Again, on allowing the pressure to rise to its original value,
one finds the aneroid read lower than at the start, this depression gradually
disappearing. The instrument, in fact, behaves as if an imperfectly elastic body.
The strain, under a uniform stress, tends to increase, and as a natural concomitant,
there is elastic after-effect (elastische Nachwirkung). That the whole of the difference
between readings with pressure descending and ascending (or, as we shall call them
for brevity, descending and ascending readings) represents, in all cases, a true after-
effect, I am not prepared to say. If we regard a rise of temperature as analogous to
a fall of pressure, a thermometer presents a somewhat parallel case; and we know
Sthat there the difference between ascending and descending readings is due to at
Sleast two causes, viz., change in the mercury meniscus, with consequent alteration of
SBnternal pressure, and temporary change of zero following exposure to the higher
temperature. Of these two causes, the latter only is a true after-effect; but the
former may also conceivably have its counterpart in the mechanism of the aneroid.
