As I shall show later, each
spot spreads from one centre only, @.e., from a stoma through which a germmal tube
from a spore has passed ; the stomata are on both sides of the leaf. A curious, though by no means isolated, phenomenon is presented in the case of old
leaves, which have shown the spots at a late stage of their life, and then turned
yellow before the spots reach their matured condition : this is the existence of a vivid
green ring around the spot, and is, without doubt, due to the mycelium of the fungus
keeping the cells active after their neighbours are dead. I have noticed the same fact
in the case of other parasitic fungi. Sections through a young white spot show that a very delicate, copiously branched,
inycelium exists between the cells of the mesophyll, both in the palissade and spongy
tissue (figs. 7-14). Closer examination shows that the mycelium is segmented at
rather long intervals, but the septa are very difficult to observe without reagents,
owing to their thinness and that of the outer walls, and to the dense, finely granular
