However, I am sure we are safe in assuming that this pigment arrives at the
gastric gland through the instrumentality of fatty matters, and it is deposited in the
gland with other reserve products, and is finally, in part at least, excreted with the
feeces. Whether or not it gives rise to the formation of other pigments, we cannot
at present say.

The Analogy between Entero-chlorophyll and some other Chlorophylloid Pigments
met with in Animals.

The lipochromes and entero-chlorophyll seem, according to all who have investi-
gated the subject, to be closely connected. This view, no doubt, has primarily arisen
from the intimate association between these pigments, and from the fact that they
are soluble in the same fat solvents.

The extraordinary facility with which the lipochromes are transported from one
part of a plant to another, seems to characterise the lipochromes in their transit
through the animal body ; of this, numerous instances have been furnished within
recent times.* The transit of a lipochrome or of a chlorophylloid pigment from the
gut, elsewhere, is not to be explained by diffusion, it depends upon solubility in fat-
dissolving media, and stands upon quite a different basis to the diffusion of such a
pigment or pigmented proteid as hemoglobin. Again, we have, as a rule, to look at
the leucocytes or amcebocytes as the carriers of fat and fat-pigments, whereas these
cells show no special preference for carrying hemoglobin. We may take it for
granted that wherever lipochromes can be carried by the blood, there a chlorophyll
