The same is true of the third tubercle in column b. From this it is certain that tubercles 1, 2 and 3 of column a and 1 and 2 of column 6}
(shown in fig. 7) have entirely disappeared during development. ARBACTA, ECHINARACHNIUS AND LEPTASTERIAS. 301

In Arbacia the amount of resorption of calcite at the actual peristomial margin is
small in spite of the fact that the auricule are incomplete arches. This is in keeping
with the fact that each area bears but a single spheridium which remains in a pit near
the peristome throughout the life of the urchin (¢f. Echinus miliaris where each ambula-
crum bears numerous spheridia three of which pass, during development, from the
ambulacrum on to the buccal membrane.—Gorpon, 1926, a).
