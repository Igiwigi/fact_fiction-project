Ceratodus does not make a nest but lays its eggs much as a newt does, scattered
through and attached to the plants in fairly deep, permanent water. They thus develop
under normal conditions in relatively well a√©rated water, and obtain a sufficient gaseous
exchange through the skin and yolk sac until the lung and internal gills become
functional.

Thus, it is natural to suppose that the external gills arose as a special accessory
respiratory apparatus to carry the larva over the early stages of development. They
must have arisen under the conditions which led to the production of a lung, and may
have originated at the same time, either in the common ancestors of the Osteolepids,
Dipnoi and Amphibia or separately in the latter two groups.

The fact that Polypterus, whith has nothing whatever to do with the Osteolepids,
differs from all other Actinopterygii in the possession of an external gill suggests that
such a structure has indeed arisen several times.

The living aquatic Urodeles swim in a characteristic manner by lateral flexures of
the whole body, each point along the axis exhibiting a regular rhythmical movement
in a transverse plane, and each point being behind an anterior point in phase. The
range of the excursion becomes greater as the posterior end is approached. The result
is that a series of lateral waves appear at the head and pass backward over the body
and tail. During this motion, when the animal is moving rapidly, the hands are pressed
against the ventral and lateral surfaces of the body, and the hind legs are extended

along the tail, with the soles of the feet inward.
