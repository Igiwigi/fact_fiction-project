and could not have differed appreciably. Testing by the tongue showed that it did
not change.

Series No. 4.—To test the effect of smaller doses of Cobra venom on the phrenic
nerve-ends,

A cat weighing 1°720 kilos. received one and a-half M.L.D.’s of Cobra venom
subcutaneously and died 4 hrs. 4 mins. later. Convulsions and cyanosis preceded
death, and the heart was beating freely when the body was opened. It was, therefore,
clear that death was due to respiratory failure. The phrenic nerves were tested with
the secondary current, by make-and-break shocks, and contractions of the diaphragm
were readily elicited up to 450 millims. distance of the secondary from the primary
coil. The coil was, in fact, pulled out 100 millims. beyond its usual working distance.
When the electrodes were directly applied to the diaphragm the muscle responded to
make-and-break shocks up to a distance of 145 millims. of the secondary coil.

The heart was beating fairly well when it was stopped by a vagal nerve stimulus
at 140 millims.

A rabbit, weighing 1-710 kilos., received one and one-third M.L.D.’s of Cobra venom
subcutaneously, and was dead 4 hrs. 55 mins. later. Before death the heart slowed
markedly, the animal became cyanosed, and there were pronounced convulsions.
Obviously respiratory failure accounted for death, A post-mortem was made directly
death occurred. The heart was still beating and was inhibited by a left vagus
stimulation at 100 millims., having been slowed by a stimulus at 130 millims. The
