to incorporate the same sources of uncertainty may originate fragility curves with a significant
scattering and (iii) neglecting the effects of uncertainties seems not to be conservative; f.i. if the 5th
percentile is considered, the deterministic approach overestimates the collapse PGA value. This,
more generally, highlights the need for a proper characterization of the uncertainty parameters
(both for linear and nonlinear models), since their propagation in the assessment procedures may
largely affect the seismic vulnerability prediction.

This original Bayesian-based framework represents an effective engineering approach,
providing an alternative use of the experimental data (short- or long-term field monitoring)
to define a probability distribution over a set of plausible structural models. Although the
methodology has been illustrated for a specific structural typology, that is the historic masonry
towers, the whole procedure may serve as guidance for its application in other structural
typologies. The achieved results, in fact, encourage the extension of this approach to the
safeguarding of different components of the cultural heritage.
