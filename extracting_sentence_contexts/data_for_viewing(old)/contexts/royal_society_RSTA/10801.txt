The last result follows from the fact that in accordance with (93) the sum ef the
hypergeometric series has an infinite aver in the denominator, and vanishes.

Then since by (92) S a, f(r+1)=,; x PT the terms of the second order are found to be

AB THIF UR.

Hence, collecting terns,

F=(148-+48) | +B+4B (+11).

Substituting for H its value (79), we have N or
