That this least value is equal to the deficiency
is a leading result in Riaxx's theory of the Abelian integrals ; the assumptions
made in the text as to the form of the roots of the equation x(z, y)=0 considered
as an equation for the determination of y are equivalent to the assumption that the
curve x(z, )=0 has certain singularities ; and i is in the addition shown that the
resulting value of the deficiency, as calculated by the formule in Professor CavLey' 8
paper *On the Higher Singularities of a Plane Curve,‚Äù Quart. Math. Journ., vol. vii.
(1866), pp. 212-222, has in fact the foregoing value, ;
