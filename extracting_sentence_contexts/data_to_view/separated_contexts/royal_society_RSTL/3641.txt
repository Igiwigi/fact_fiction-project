Fourthly. The range at the higher station is greater than that
at the lower. This is an evident and necessary consequence of the fact, that the max-
imum above mnst exceed the maximum below, and that at sunset and sunrise they
must both pass through zero. It might be more correct, however, to consider the
continuous part of the curve extending to the moment before sunset from the moment
after $unrise. In this case we might expect the difference of intensity at the two
stations to increase very rapidly with the obliquity of the sun's rays, so that the two
curves, instead of approaching one another in the morning and evening as they ap-
pear to do (Curves XII. and XII1.), ought to separate further.
