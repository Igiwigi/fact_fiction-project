Nevertheless, the solutions cannot have contact points between the free boundaries. This is an important ingredient in
constructing a continuous family of sub-solutions that are instrumental for improving the cone of monotonicity.


ie. improvement of the cone, and Lipschitz norm. The proof of this type of results uses several
geometric facts and observations, that we shall now line up here. The observation we can make
are the following. Observation 1: (Regular solutions).
