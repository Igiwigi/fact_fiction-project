not affect the purity of the solutions, but if present in considerable quantities might
lead to serious errors in the concentrations. Sodium carbide does not appear to be
soluble in metallic sodium, but under certain conditions large quantities of hydrogen
may be absorbed. The concordance of our measurements for the density ot
50-per cent. solutions of sodium hydroxide prepared from different samples of sodium
seemed to indicate that there could not be any large quantity of volatile impurity
in the metal, but on the advice of Dr. Scorr we tried an additional method ot
purification by heating a sample of sodium in an iron ladle in such a way as to
expel any carbide or hydride that might initially be present. The metal was heated
until it caught fire and was then poured into melted paraffin wax, but when
subsequently converted in the usual way into hydroxide it gave a normal value for
the density, and did not appear to have been altered in any way by the roasting.
As a matter of fact, metallic sodium is now made almost exclusively by electrolytic
processes and no longer contains the black explosive carbide that was formerly
associated with it ; even when crude sodium is heated, the black residue that is left

in the ladle appears to consist merely of a little lamp-black from the burning
petroleum, and if clean metal is used no black scum is produced. A test for acetylene
in the gases produced by the action of steam on the metal gave a negative result.

An attempt was made to detect the presence of hydride in the metal by
