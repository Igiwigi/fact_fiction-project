Monkeys evolved along two divergent lines of descent. The Platyrrhines would seem
to represent the direct, though no doubt somewhat modified, descendants of the
ancestral stock and remained on a lower developmental plane than the Catarrhines,
as a kind of by-product of the evolutionary stream, in the comparative isolation of
the S. American continent. The Catarrhines, more progressive, branched off on a
line of their own and, as the result of acceleration and abbreviation of their develop-
mental processes, so perfected their placental arrangements that one or other of their
early branches proved capable of giving origin to the final grade in Primate evolution,
the Anthropoid, as I have designated it, comprising the Anthropoid Apes and Man.

The following scheme indicates the way in which I would arrange the sub-divisions
of the Primates in a phyletic series, on the basis of the known facts concerning their
development :â€”
