* Indeed, close observation shows that the one necessary
condition for resumption of the old posture is head movement or head displacement,
and no sensory stimulation that fails to cause head displacement is adequate to
disturb the temporary symmetrical posture. These facts throw a new light on the experiment. It is precisely the labyrinthine
proprioceptors that are liable to stimulation by movement of the head. As we
have already seen, experiments with the totally delabyrinthized frog show that the
muscle receptors themselves are adequate to hold any posture that has once been
successfully imposed.
