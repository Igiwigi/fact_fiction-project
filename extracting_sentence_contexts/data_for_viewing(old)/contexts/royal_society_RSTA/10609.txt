under the influence of light the amount of work present in the molecules as energy
of the atoms increases. Obviously the ratio of the amount of light transformed into
heat to that transformed into kinetic energy of the atoms is not constant. At first
: the energy of the atoms and molecules gradually increases (induction period of
energy), until a reaction, a shifting of the point of equilibrium to another one, becomes
possible (chemical induction period), which is observed by an increase of the velocity
constant. Under the action of light the storage of energy in the atoms and molecules
ultimately reaches a maximum, after which light produces no more strain upon the
atoms, preventing them only from losing the energy once acquired, and the whole of
the light entering into the system is transformed into heat. This maximum kinetic
energy of the atoms is a function of the intensity and composition of light, of the
nature of the substance, of the surrounding medium, &c., and becomes apparent in
the fact that a velocity constant, indicative of constant properties of the atoms and
molecules, is obtained. When light is removed from the system the energy stored in
the atoms and molecules, under the impulses of the light waves, gradually disappears,
changing either into chemical energy and heat (as long as the reaction continues in
the dark, chemical deduction period) or into heat alone (deduction period of energy).
When the maximum kinetic energy of the atoms is reached under the action of light,
it is evident that the energy stored up must be directly proportional to the mass of
each substance. To the above equation for equilibrium the terms v,dm,+ rd...
ob v,dm, must therefore be added. By means of a cycle process at a constant
