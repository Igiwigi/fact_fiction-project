Qnaintained by tissue resembling that which surrounded the tracheides in the more
‘gomplex portions. The young roots, of which only one is seen, were situated in the
‘Biddle third, and their steles had no direct connection with the tracheides of the
ascular strand, The tissue of the process surrounding the strand was composed of cells
resembling those of the prothallus and bore archegonia. In the case of the branches
or the process of fig. 10, on the other hand, the tracheides of the root joined with
those of the continuous vascular strand, Fig. 14 shows the structure of the latter
as seen in transverse section. It resembles the stele of a root, but is simpler, and is
Sounded by a fairly regular sheath of large cells, This sheath was recognisable by
he dense protoplasmic contents of its cells, and may be compared with an endodermis
Since the roots appear to take origin from it. Between the sheath and the tracheides
Bure smaller cells with thin walls. This tissue in part corresponds to phloem, so far
“as its position in the strand and the fact that it is composed of elongated elements
ee concerned, Sieve tubes have, however, not been recognised in it.
Tn the above instances, the vascular strand may be fairly termed a stele, although
le existence of phloem has not been established. In other processes the structure

simpler. No definite strand was present, but in the corresponding axial position
groups of tracheides were found. These sometimes abutted directly upon ordinary
parenchymatous cells of the process, or at places the layer adjoining them was
Boomposed of more elongated cells. Tracheides were also found near to the main

‘oup, but isolated from it by parenchyma. The differentation of the tissues of the

Aroots in a corresponding position showed that the groups of tracheides and the
