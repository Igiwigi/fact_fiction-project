The main difficulty
when dealing with the primitive equations on spaces of bounded functions is that the hydrostatic
Helmholtz projection P fails to be bounded with respect to the L*°-norm. This is similar to the case
of the classical Stokes semigroup, see §3. The proof is based on the fact that the combination of the
three main players, V, P, elAr, nevertheless give rise to bounded operators on LoeL? (92), which in
addition satisfy typical global, second order parabolic decay estimates. Note that the choice of the boundary conditions involved affects to a very great extent
the difficulty in proving these estimates. For the case of mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary
conditions, i.e.
