The presence of archaeal homologues close to the root of three out of the 14
four clades gives some credence to the hypothesis that duplication of the beta-carbonic anhydrase : _
is very ancient, perhaps occurring before the archaea/bacteria separation. Except for the main : Ss
clades and a few other shallower groups, the bootstrap values are altogether low, an ambiguity Dh
often observed when reconstructing deep phylogenies based on short protein alignments, due to :S
the small amount of genetic information available [79]. This is further emphasized by the fact that : a

the main bacterial phyla—with the notable exception of cyanobacteria—were rarely reconstructed
as monophyletic, even inside each clade. The incongruence between the carbonic anhydrase
tree and the generally accepted tree of life can be explained by either one, or a combination
of two, main factors: (i) the amount of phylogenetic information contained in this 200-site
alignment might be too low to reliably approximate the true tree or (ii) the carbonic anhydrase
has been horizontally transferred several times. Among the few well-supported clades, the two
that almost solely comprise sequences from the same phylum are two groups of cyanobacteria,
one belonging to clade B (bootstrap support: 98) and one to clade C (low bootstrap support)
(figure 2).
