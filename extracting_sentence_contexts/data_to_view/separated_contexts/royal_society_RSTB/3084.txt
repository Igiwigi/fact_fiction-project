Douuamet placed (1739) a silver ring under the periosteum in a living animal and
found, some time after, that the ring had become covered by bone. He inferred from
this that the periosteum secreted bone. This experiment is often quoted as a proof
of the osteogenic power of the periosteum,

There is no doubt about the fact that when a metallic ring which closely fits the
shaft of a growing bone is placed under the periosteum, new bone will in course
of time surround the ring. The deduction drawn therefrom, that the periosteum
must, therefore, be the source of the new bone, does not necessarily follow. Irritation
of a bone excites proliferation of the bone cells and the osteoblasts are poured out
from the Haversian Canals on to the surface of the bone and fill the interstices of the
soft tissues surrounding the shaft, such as the loose areolar tissue existing between
the bone and the periosteum.
