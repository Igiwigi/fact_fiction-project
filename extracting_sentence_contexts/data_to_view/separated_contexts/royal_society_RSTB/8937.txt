Mike’s ophthalmoscope
was put on display, and my office was close to the door from which they
emerged from his demonstration, so I overheard the comments and conversa-
tions of the visitors, and sometimes took part in them. They had hugely
enjoyed what Mike had shown them and told them about spider vision, and
most of them obviously recalled enough optics to understand something about
what was on view. The atmosphere was euphoric, and I gained the impression
that Mike had shown many sceptical American optometrists that the straightfor-
ward pursuit of knowledge for its own sake is certainly an interesting, enjoyable
and possibly worthy occupation, in spite of the fact that the research was clearly
not being done for its potential commercial rewards. All that I have mentioned so far happened almost 50 years ago. Some of
Mike’s research over the following years is recounted in the book he wrote
with D-E Nilsson, published in 2002, and already a classic with a new edition
out last year.
