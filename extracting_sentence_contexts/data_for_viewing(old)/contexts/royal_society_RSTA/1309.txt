Denoting the total derivative with respect to the true value of contact radius with prime (’) and
assuming that both conditions 2.1 and 2.2 are true, as well as daj;(P))/dP; 40, (2.12) becomes

(Pi — Po)? $(a1)

2 S(a1)

The latter expression readily gives the amount of unloading P; — Po necessary for the

transformation from the non-adhesive solution of the Hertz-type problem to the JKR adhesive

one. In fact, P; — Po is the additional term that has to be subtracted from the expression for the
contact force in order to reduce the non-adhesive problem to the adhesive one:

_ Amway S?(a1)
Py —Po=,} a (2.16)

Since the unloading curve is now supposed to be linear, according to (2.14), the increment of
punch displacement 5; — 52 obeys the following law: (P; — Po)/(61 — 62) = S(a1). Therefore, (2.16)

leads to
