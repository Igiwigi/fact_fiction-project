Consequently, the additional factor of difficulty, that the presence of a well-developed
middle lamella involves, is here done away with. Each bast cell is freely pitted, the
pits of neighbouring cells being placed symmetrically opposite one another. When
treated with sulphuric acid and stained in the usual manner the following appearance
is produced. The pit membranes being 80mewhat thick have distinetly swollen, and
in 80 doing have increased the distance from one another of the ends of the proto-
plasmic processes projecting into the pit cavity. All the processes are deeply stained,
and between each symmetrically opposite pair is a small less stained portion tra-
versing the pit membrane, which from its reactions musb be protoplaxm. Thus it
stains with iodine, and when coloured with methyl violeb is not digsolved by
glycerine (Plate 68, fig. 6). It is also well brought out by HorMaNnN's blue, the
staining characters of which have already been sufficiently dwelb upon. That it is
not callus is clear from the fact that it does not dissolve in sulphurie acid. The
structure traversing the pit membrane is somewhat difficult to observe, both on
account of its very 8mall size and its want of definition. Indeed, it rather presents
the appearance of a small blue cloud between the ends of the deeply-stained and well-
defined processes.

The protoplasmic processes projecting into the pits are broad at their extremities,
and are at, the same time more deeply coloured at that point. They gradually taper
off from the bottom of the pit inwards, widening again as they join the general proto-
