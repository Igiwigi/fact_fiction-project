Figure 1. A reproducible dissociation between mathematical and general semantic knowledge. The figure shows brain activity in professional mathematicians evoked by

statements. (Left) Brain maps showing areas of greater activation during reflection on mathematical statements versus non-mathematical statements (blue) or vice versa
