Clearly the depth of the keyway is a factor of the very first importance, and keyways
of moderate depth will produce a comparatively small effect on the torsional rigidity. It is also shown that the effect of cutting two equal and opposite slits is practically
equal, in the two cases which I have calculated (namely, «= 7/6 and «= 7/2), to twice
the effect of a single slit. It seems, therefore, that the study of these sections brings to light several
interesting facts in the theory of elasticity, and will well repay the trouble involved
in dealing with the long and somewhat tedious algebra and arithmetic which lead to
these results,
