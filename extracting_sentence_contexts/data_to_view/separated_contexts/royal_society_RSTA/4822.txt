While it
is still possible that complex tangling occurs at length scales below our present resolution [1],
footpoint motions occur over all length scales and presumably so should the tangling. There
is little evidence for it on the largest scales, which appear increasingly well fitted by potential
fields over time [2]. This fact gives a clear indication that coronal field lines are constantly being
reconnected: uprooted from one footpoint and reattached to another. Based on this reasoning, we propose that magnetic field lines in a given portion of the corona
are undergoing topological change at some rate &. Two questions are raised by this proposition:
Firstly, how is topological change related to heating?
