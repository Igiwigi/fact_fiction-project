Hence the general effects of diffusion ; the appearance of the anions or cathions
round the edges and on the further side of the electrodes when in the form of plates;
the manner in which the current or discharge will follow all the forms of the elec-
trolyte, however contorted. Hence the effects which Noi has s0 well examined
and described* in his papers on the distribution of currents in conducting masses,
All these effects indicate the direction of the currents or discharges which occur in
and through the dielectrics, and these are in every case preceded by equivalent in-
qductive actions of the contiguous particles,

1352. Hence also the advantage, when the exciting forces are weak or require as-
sistance, of enlarging the mass of the electrolyte; of increasing the size of the elec-
trodes; of making the coppers surround the zincs :â€”all is in harmony with the view
of induction which I am endeavyouring to examine; I do not perceive as yet one fact
against it.

1353. There are many points of electrolytic discharge which ultimately will require
to be very closely considered, though I can but slightly touch upon them. It is not
that, as far as I have investigated them, they present any contradiction to the view
taken (for I have carefully, though unsuccessfully, sought for such cases), but simply
want of time as yet to pursue the inquiry, which prevents me from entering upon
them here.

1354. One point is, that different electrolytes or dielectrics require different initial
intensities for their decompoxsition (912.). This may depend upon the degree of polar-
ization which the particles require before electrolytic discharge commences. It
