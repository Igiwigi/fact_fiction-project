Then, commencing with any point c, a complete circulation
will be represented by the 8uccession of transits

ctod, dtoa, atoB, Btoy, yto#, Ftoa, atob, btoc. But whether a, Þ, y, 8 bear respectively the same signs or 8igns contrary to those of a, b, c, d, the transit be-
tween any two points Þ to y will be of the same nature, as regards continuance or change of sign, as the transib
from b to &, and thus we 8ee that the complete cycle or total revolution aboye indicated is only a reduplication
of, and may be fully designated by the hemicyclic 8uccession c to d, & to a, a to 3, 3 to y, for which the num-
ber of variations therefore will be the same as for any 8imilar 8uccession obtained by commencing with any other
element in the original system of points instead of c. If the oppoxite points bear like signs, the above SuCces8i0N
of transits may be indicated by the order c, d, a, b, c; if they bear contrary signs by the order c, d, a, b, c, and thus
it is that tho idea arises of the two kinds of 80-called circulation, but which are in fact only more or less dis-
guised 8pecies of 8emicirculation,


L AND IMAGINARY ROOTS OF EQUATIONS. 603

_ Let the derivative of this function be taken in regard to v, and we have

HET F(wn)=Balan+Pa)+Be(ap fa)" .. +Pa(ag+Þ,cÞ%
where ,4,, 5 - - - Þ,s, have the same 8igns as t,, 5, « « « 5, respectively. Now the pencil-type of F'(u, v) will be the per-rotatory type g,, e,-1, - - - £4, of which
by construction the variation-index is v, Hence by hypothesis F(x, v) has not more
than » real roots, 1. e. at least 2/—y imaginary roots. Hence F(, v) has at least, that
number of imaginary roots, i. e. at most (254+1)—(2i—1), i. e. »+L real roots.
