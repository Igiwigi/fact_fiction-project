Further, when vertical sections are constructed they present no trace of such a
suggested bending, the tooth is typically acrodont, and the bending must be inter-
preted as an elongation of the base (fig. 36, C). The teeth are, in fact, more like those
of a fish, such as Amia, than a Urodele.

In one instance the tooth appears to have been folded near the base as in some of
the simpler Stegocephalian teeth and the teeth of the existing Ceratophrys ; such at
least appears to be the only possible explanation of such a section as that shown
near the letter D in Section 27, Plate 70, from the right dentary of specimen 2.
Similar but less definite foldings are presented by the roots of all the teeth preserved
in the left dentary of the same specimen (Section 29, Plate 70). In order to
determine whether the length of the teeth in a series is distributed according to
any law the measurements were made which are given in the following Table :—
