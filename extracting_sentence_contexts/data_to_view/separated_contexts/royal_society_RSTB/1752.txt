science, he could not
foresee the great extension which it would take, especially in consequence of the
establishment of special offices for the collection of statistics. Notwithstanding that,
it is indeed striking to see how large a part of those demological problems which
occupy us to-day Graunt brought up at the first throw, and with what keenness of
vision he recognized not only the bifurcation into statistics of natality and of
mortality, but also that other bifureation which vital statistics show in respect to its
place amongst the other sciences. The double character of statistics as a science has,
in the course of centuries, been emphasized by the fact that statistics have been
classed on the one side with the political, and on the other with the anthropological,
group of the natural sciences. Graunt shows in the mere title of his book how well
he is aware of this double character of his new science: he calls his observations both
“political and natural.” This conviction comes out still plainer in the two dedi-
cations, of which—in a most characteristic way—one is addressed to the minister,
Joun Roperts, Lord Truro, the other to the President of the Royal Society,
Sir Ropert Moray; so that one dedication is addressed to the politician, the other —
to the natural philosopher.
