Such then are the leading features which we believe can be seen in the roe-like
particles ; some of them favour a relationship with Actinomyces, but from others we
cannot in our present state of knowledge draw any conclusions. The deep radiation
isa most remarkable phenomenon, and one which has greatly struck both Carrer aud
Lewis and CunnincHAM ; these observers looked upon them as consisting mostly of
fat crystals, and although we also think that fat crystals may greatly increase the
radiate appearance, yet we have found the radiate zone, as in figs. 14 and 16, after
prolonged subjection of the sections to the fat solvents mentioned above. Coupled
with these curious facts we have found others equally hard to interpret. Thus, in
addition to the opaque ochroid roe-like bodies, we have met with others, transparent
and gelatinous, which, when pressed under a cover slip, exhibited a radiate structure-
less and refractive peripheral zone; yet, from microchemical testing, we could draw
no conclusions as to their nature. Similarly, when we read the records of Carrer
and Lewis and CunNniNGHAM, we find that they record cases in which the specimens
contained innumerable cayenne pepper-like granules.
