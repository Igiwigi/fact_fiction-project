However, as
ALH 84001 is a highly shocked meteorite that is reported to contain a crustal assimilant, the D/H ratio of its apatite may not be
representative of the Martian atmosphere at the time of crystallization.

the D/H ratio of Marsâ€™ mantle is low (5D < 275% [57,58]). However, not all hydrous primary
(igneous) minerals contain D/H ratios representative of the Martian mantle reservoir (figure 3). In fact, the majority of these minerals have D/H ratios somewhere between low mantle and high
crustal/atmospheric ratios (assuming the crust and atmosphere are equilibrated, but see [64]). There are a number of ways that these intermediate D/H ratios can be produced, both pre- and
post-crystallization. In contrast to eucrite apatite D/H ratios, apatite in the shergottites and ALH 84001 shows
a distinct trend of increasing D/H with decreasing water content (figure 3b).
