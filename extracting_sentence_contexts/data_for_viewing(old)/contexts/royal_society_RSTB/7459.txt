ducing an ‘economic control’ of blowfly populations.

That this is due to a gradual increase in the amount of food which is available in the field
seems likely. The reasons for this belief have been given. Any attempt at a restoration of
a previous balance by means of the destruction of carcasses when discovered would seem to
have little hope of achieving any great measure of success. Such a method would deal with
a relatively small proportion of the carrion present and would consequently have little
effect upon the general fly population in the field.

2. Competition and population density

A number of workers have laid stress on the great reduction in fly populations by com-
petition and on the part parasitism plays in rendering competition less effective. The fact

has apparently been overlooked that competition, by itself, cannot result in a stabilized fly
population, and that the outcome of competition itself produces the phenomenon attributed
to parasitism.

Intense competition, in reducing the survival value of a larval population, gives rise to
a small population of flies which are probably below average size. These will lay compara-
