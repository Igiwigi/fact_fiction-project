About 70 gm. of material separated
& in the form of dark yellow rhomboidal crystals. These were fractionally crystallised
2 from 50 per cent. aqueous alcohol after treatment with a small quantity of charcoal.
5 Crystallisation of the citromycetin was now very rapid, as it separated immediately on
®& cooling in fine yellow needles. No other crystalline product was isolated, and the
material was separated into four fractions of slightly decreasing purity :—

3) The final mother-liquors on evaporation gave an alcohol-soluble tar weighing 24-8 gm.
“ from which further quantities of citromycetin could be extracted by dissolving it
© in alcohol and precipitating with a large volume of ether.

a (b) The tarry matter may also be separated somewhat less thoroughly by taking
= advantage of the fact that it is more soluble in 50 per cent. aqueous alcohol than is
£  citromycetin. This method can only be applied efficiently, however, if the proportion
+ of tar in the crude citromycetin is not high. With very impure specimens of crude
3 citromycetin, the whole product is soluble in small amounts of aqueous alcohol and,
£ for purification, is better treated by method (a).
