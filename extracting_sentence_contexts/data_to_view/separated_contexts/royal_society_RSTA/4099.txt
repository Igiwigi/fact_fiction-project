A next generation of experiments to test the fragility of many-body dynamics were initiated
by a team lead by Patricia Levstein at National University of Cordoba (Argentina). These
used mainly the interacting 'H nuclei in organic crystals and liquid crystals in a number of
configurations and settings [7,8,10]. As a whole, the experiments were consistent with the fact
that the experimental T3 never exceeds more than a few times T2. In other words, T3 keeps
tied to the time scale that characterizes the reversed many-body interaction. This led one to
postulate that in an infinite many-spin system the complex dynamics could favour the action
of any small non-inverted interaction that perturbs the reversal procedure.
