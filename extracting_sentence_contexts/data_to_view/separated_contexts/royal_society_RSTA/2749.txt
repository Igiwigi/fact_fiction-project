The process of machine learning is iterative,
ie. it involves a living process of analysing these models, and adjusting training data and
learning algorithms in order to optimise for success, which is defined and determined by
developers.

— As mentioned above, machine learning techniques depend on directions of what to look
for. A key human element in machine learning is feature engineering, i.e. deciding on
what attributes the machine learning algorithm will train. This is, in fact, a much more
challenging task for developers vis-a-vis conducting the actual act of learning. While
there are increasing efforts to reduce human intervention in feature selection, this is
unlikely [13].

3. State of the field: India’s artificial intelligence policy landscape today

(a) Artificial intelligence as an emerging priority area

The development, adoption and promotion of AI have been visibly high on the list of priorities of
the Indian Government, an approach that rests on the premise that AI has the potential to make
lives easier and make society more equal [14].
