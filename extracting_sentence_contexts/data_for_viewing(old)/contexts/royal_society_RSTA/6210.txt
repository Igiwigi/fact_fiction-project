A prequel theory to inflation remains a very mysterious problem and its solution is largely
unknown even today. This is perhaps one of the most important ingredients necessary to make
our current (and future) cosmological standard models more complete. In a sense, initial or
boundary conditions are necessary for any cosmological model to be more predictive. All these
issues became more substantial and received a blow of original ideas in the 1980s (the decade
1980-1990 may be called indeed a ‘golden decade’ in theoretical cosmology research).

In 1983, Hartle & Hawking introduced a radical approach using path integral methods to
describe the problem of initial conditions in quantum cosmology introduced in the 1960s [21].
That approach, called the no-boundary proposal for the wave function of the universe, suggested a
beginning of the universe not as dramatic as that appearing in the standard model of the universe.
In fact, there is a beginning but the initial singularity is now replaced by a situation where time is
imaginary, there is a smooth passage to a quantum regime, a creation ‘from nothing’. The Hartle—
Hawking wave function also peaks as most probably states those that describe infinitely large and
empty universes.

However, it soon became clear that other, equally probable and similarly constructed,
‘creation-from-nothing’ proposals are possible, but with completely different predictions. For
instance, a small, hot early universe, pretty much like the standard big bang model of the classical
universe, is the prediction of A. Vilenkin’s tunnelling model creation-from-nothing 1985 model [22],
which also predicts a period of exponential expansion [23].

Soon however, the problem arose of what it means for the universe to be in a typical quantum
state, and what is the meaning probability in quantum cosmology as well as the possible set of
