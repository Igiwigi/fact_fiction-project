errors) and +1 frame-shift immunity. Such features explain why the evolutionary pressure might
have led to the selection of this mechanism. In fact, accuracy in protein synthesis needs to
have been preserved to some extent in actual organisms and the preservation of the degeneracy
distribution over geological times might be the molecular evidence of such origin. Note that it
has been proposed that extant triplet codes derive from primeval codes having codons with
more than three nucleotides [21]. This could ensure the necessary bonding stability for direct
decoding without ribosomes.
