Figure 1. The Allais Paradox (left) is a canonical example of what we call a discrete decision. It involves a single choice between two options; the choice is
independent of action, context and time. It has no influence on what options are available in the future. A dog moving along a bank preparing to jump and
grab a fish (right) is a canonical example of a continuous decision. (Online version in colour.)

While such complex behaviour may be conceptualized as a
series of discrete choices—one choice at each moment—this
conceptualization is both facile and reductive. It misses some
of the most important aspects of continuous decisions, such
as the fact that each choice opens many new doors and closes
many others. Alternatively, one could view the choice as the
selection of an overarching strategy, but this just ignores the
important moment-by-moment nature of continuous decisions.
It is best to view the decision as encompassing the entire process,
from the continuum of motor adjustments to the selection of
flight control strategies. Of course, discrete and continuous
