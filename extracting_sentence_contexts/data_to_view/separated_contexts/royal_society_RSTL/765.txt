The insolubility
of muriate of silver 'might be alleged as the cause of this, if I
had not tried the experiment by pouring nitrate of silver into
green muriate of iron, in which case all the substances were
presented to each other in solution. The result was not re-
duction, but muriate of .silver and nitrate of iron. This fact
rests upon a much more extensive basis than mere mechanical
circumstances ; and, if pursued with the attention it deserves,
it would lead us into the wide expanse of complicated affinities

and their relations. From reasoning alone we should be dis-
posed to think that an acid, s0 easily decomposed as the nitric,
would be sufficient to prevent the reduction of a metal which
it can dissolve. But on the one hand it can spend its oxygen


Platina and Mercury upon each other. 121

apon a part of the oxide of the green sulphate of iron, while
on the other its affinity for oxide of silver is not powerful
enough to retain it, when there is another part of the oxide of
iron present to deprive it of oxygen.
