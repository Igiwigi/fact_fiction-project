3. Digitalizing with the asset administration shell

In the traditional definition of industrial systems, they are constituted by a set of components,
included the human. As formally represented by the tuple, the Industry 4.0-compliant
digitalization approach means a radical shifting from this traditional component-oriented to a
capability-oriented infrastructure. It is a kind of servitization process, which shifts the focus from
the all-in-one component model towards capabilities, e.g. functionalities offered via an IoS-based
function-/business-oriented infrastructure, which also allows the composition/orchestration of
distributed services that are dynamically put together.

As a matter of fact, any tuple <asset, life cycle-phase-of-the-asset, layer 6> is able to publish,
offer data, information and functions as ‘services’, as well as subscribe, consume and compose
‘services’ offered by other tuples. Moreover, the individual digitalization layers can be opened up
