It is probable, that inland lakes were much more numerous than they are at pre-
sent, before the excavation of the many gorges by which our modern rivers make
their escape; and this is consistent with the frequent occurrence of the remains of
the hippopotamus in the diluvian gravel of England, and of various parts of Europe. 204 The Rev. Mr. BuokLAnD's account of Fossil Teeth and

It is in the highest degree curious to vbserve, that four of
the genera of animals whose bones are thus widely diffused
over the temperate, and even polar regions of the northern
hemisphere, should at present exist only in tropical climates,
and chiefly south of the equator ; and that the only country in
which the elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and hyzna are
now associated, is Southern Africa. In the immediate neigh-
bourhood of the Cape they all live and die together, as they
formerly did in Britain ; whilst the hippopotamus is now con-
fined exclusively to Africa, and the elephant, rhinoceros and
hyzna are also diffused widely over the continent of Asia,

Such are the principal facts I observed in the interior of
the cave at Kirkdale, and such the leading conclusions that
seem to arise from them ; and I cannot sufficiently lament
that I was not present at its first opening, to witness the exact
state in which it appeared, before any part of the surface of
the mud had been disturbed. From the description given of the state of the bones, and
of the mud and stalactite that accompany them, we may ex-
tract the following detailed history of the operations that have
Successively been going on within the cave. 18t. There appears to have been a period (and if we may
form an estimate from the small quantity of stalagmite now
found on the actual floor of the cave, a very short one,) dur-
ing which this aperture in the rock existed, but was not

It is not unlikely that, in this antediluvian period, England was connected with the
Continent, and that the excayation of the shallow channel of the Straits of Dover,
and of a considerable portion of that part of the German ocean which lies between
the east coast of England and the mouths of the Elbe and Rhine, may have been the
effect of diluvial denudation, The average depth of all this tract of water is $aid to
be less than thirty fathoms.
