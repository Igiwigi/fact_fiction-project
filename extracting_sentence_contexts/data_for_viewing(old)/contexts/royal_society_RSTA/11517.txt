Hitherto we were inclined to ascribe the presence of oxygen in platinum black to
the fact that it was washed and dried at 100° in the presence of air, since platinum
black, when heated in an atmosphere of oxygen, absorbs this gas until the tempera-
ture reaches 860°-380° C. If freshly reduced platinum black contains either or both
of these gases occluded in it, then it is easy to account for the presence of oxygen in
the substance we actually obtain; for, on coming into contact with the air, both of
these substances would be immediately burnt out and oxygen would take their place.

As a last resource for the preparation of pure platinum black, free from oxygen,
we originally intended, if all else failed, to attempt to wash and dry it out of contact
with the air; but these experiments show that even if we did succeed in keeping out
oxygen, we might, it is true, obtain platinum black free from oxygen, but it would
on the other hand be equally valueless for our purpose, since it would in all probability
contain carbon monoxide and hydrogen.
