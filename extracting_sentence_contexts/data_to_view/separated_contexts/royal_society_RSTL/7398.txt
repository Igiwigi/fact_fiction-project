V Harmotome. It is now some years since I showed that simple crystals of Harmotome did not
= exist, and that those of Strontian in Scotland (Morvenite), considered as such, presented,
in fact, a twinning formed by the interpenetration of two principal individuals. The
particular orientation of the plane of the optic axes in each of the crystals of which the
least complicated of snch groups are composed had led me to refer their crystalline form
to a right rhombic prism of 124* 47'; and I had been induced to look on this prism as
presenting a peculiar sort of hemihedrism, or rather hemimorphism, such that only the
half of the fundamental rhombic octahedron existed, that namely formed of four faces
parallel two and two, and lying in the same zone. More recently I had established, in
