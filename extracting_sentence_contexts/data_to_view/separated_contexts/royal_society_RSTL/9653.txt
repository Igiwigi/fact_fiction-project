EVOLUTION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 529

From these considerations we may conclude that the effect of the separation of a
satellite is to destroy planetary rotation, but to preserve angular momentum within
the planetary subsystem. Hence we ought to find that those planets which have large satellites have a slow
rotation, but have a relatively large amount of angular momentum within their

| systems,

| A proper method of comparison between the several planets is difficult of attain-
ment, but these ideas seem to agree with the fact that the earth, which is large
compared with Mars, rotates in the same time, but that the whole angular momentum

_ of earth and moon is large. *

Â© * A method of comparing the various members of the solar system has occurred to me, but it is not
founded on rigorous argument.
