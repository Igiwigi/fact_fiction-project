however, removed when the gases are in a state of such intimate admixture that it is not
requisite to conyey the action through a chain of particles; in the gas battery this
chain is supplied by the intervening electrolyte, and thus the same action which is
local in the experiments of D6BEREINER is circulating in the gas battery ; the latter
bears the same relation to the former as the action of the ordinary voltaic battery
does to the normal phenomena of chemical affinity. This relation is confirmed by
the facts detailed in the paper of Dr. Hexsy, as the gases which he there found wonld
combine by the presence of spongy platinum, are precisely those which will combine
in the gas battery ; thus oxygen and hydrogen combine rapidly, oxygen and carbonic
oxide much more slowly, and oxygen and olefiant gas very feebly, 80 much 80, as, in
Hexsr's experiments, to require heat to induce combination. Of course chlorine and
bydrogen, which will unite without platinum, will, @ fortiori, unite with the aid of
platinum, or they may in the gas battery occasion secondary action; the oxygen
evolved by the decomposition of water by the chlorine combining with the free hy-
drogen in the tube. As oxygen and ammonia will, when at a slightly elevated tem-
perature, combine by the influence of spongy platinum, forming water and leaving
nitrogen, I now in order further to test this relation, tried
