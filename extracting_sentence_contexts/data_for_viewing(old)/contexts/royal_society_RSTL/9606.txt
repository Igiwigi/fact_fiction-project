These facts, of course, tend to show that in the excitable tissues of Aurelia there
is 8ome element which performs the essential function of nerve—the function, namely,
of conveying stimuli irrespective of the passage of contractile waves. But in view
of the fact that in these same tissues contractile waves may occur of 80 feeble an
intensity as to be almost invisible, it becomes necessary to be quite sure that such
waves may not sometimes be 80 feeble as to be quite invisible, and therefore that what
IT have called nervous waves of stimulation are not in reality only invisible muscular
waves of contraction. The evidence which I have to adduce in order to show that
such is nob the case is happily unequivocal. I cannot, indeed, prove that muscular
waves of contraction may not occur in the excitable tissues of Aurelia of too feeble an
intensity to admit of becoming visible ; but I am able to prove that, whether or not
such is the case, other waves of a distinctively nervous kind undoubtedly pass through
these tissues. The proof of this consists in the fact that sometimes waves of stimu-
lation will continue to pass from one tissue area to another after the passage of
contractile waves between these two areas has been blocked by section ; or, reverting
to the terms employed in my previous paper, excitational continuity may in some
cages remain intact after contractional continuity has been destroyed. And forasmuch
as it is impossible to suppose that an invisible, or very feeble, wave of contraction can
force a passage where a visiþle, or very strong, wave of the same kind fails to do 50,
the following observations must be regarded as eliminating the possible source of error
