The repair of DSBs by HR is
largely dependent on CHD4 and its interaction with BRIT1
[101]. CHD4â€™s chromatin remodelling activity was shown to
be required for the recruitment of BRIT1, a key regulator of
HR. In fact, loss of CHD4, similar to that of BRIT1, impaired
the assembly of RPA, RAD51 and BRCA2 at DSBs and ren-
dered cells hypersensitive to PARP inhibitor-induced DSBs, a
key feature of HR-deficient cells [62,93,94,101] (figure 2). The proper loading of HR proteins by CHD4 requires actively
transcribed chromatin [102]. Paradoxically, however, the
PARP-ZMYND8-CHD4 axis was shown to induce transcrip-
tional silencing in cis at DSBs [61,68,96,99].
