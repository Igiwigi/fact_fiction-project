We have gone into this question of the mode of purifying carbon bisulphide in som
detail since it has been proposed to utilize observations of the rotation in this ligui
as a means of measuring strong currents. The facts go to show that for the purpose
of magnetic rotation it is not difficult to obtain carbon bisulphide which is practical,
pure. Indeed, we found that our stock liquid (“ pure redistilled ” carbon bisulphi¢
from Hopkry and WititAms), without any treatment, although it was somewha
opaque, gave almost the same rotation as it did after treatment. By merely shakin
with mercury the opacity can be removed.
