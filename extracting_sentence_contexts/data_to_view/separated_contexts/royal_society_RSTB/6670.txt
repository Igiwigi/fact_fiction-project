28, Plate 39). This bent part
represented the rudiment of half the keel. It was only distinguishable from the
surrounding tissue by the fact that the cells covering its outer surface, though not yet
forming a definite perichondrial membrane, were orientated parallel with the surface
of the procartilage, i.e. at an angle to the surface of the explant, whilst the cells of the
surrounding undifferentiated tissue were orientated parallel to the surface of the ex-

plant. The chondrogenic cells of the keel rudiment were compressed in a dorso-ventral
direction, and their long axes were thus at right angles to the future perichondrial cells
covering the outer surface of the keel. There was no visible boundary between the
medial surfaces of the two keel rudiments and the undifferentiated tissue between them.
