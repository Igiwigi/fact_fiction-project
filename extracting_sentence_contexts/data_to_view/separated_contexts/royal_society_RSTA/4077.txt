This may be due to the difficulty in fabricating nanocomposites
reinforced solely with mono- or few-layer GO flakes. In addition, it is also not easy to manipulate
the complicated stacked GO structure in micromechanical testing instruments. Despite these
difficulties, few-layer GO could, in fact, have even wider application: (i) it is easier to prepare
than monolayer GO and is thus more amenable to scale-up; (ii) it is more likely to be present
than monolayer GO in some nanocomposite matrices, especially hydrophobic polymers, or even
ceramics and metals; and (iii) bulk nanocomposites based on stacked GO have more practical
applications than GO paper. In this work, the deformation mechanics of mono-, bi- to multilayer GO structures with
different stacking configurations have been studied. The shift of the Raman D band position (wp)
of GO as a function of strain Â¢ has been used to follow the deformation mechanics of monolayer
GO flakes to investigate the validity of continuum mechanics on the microscale.
