with
regard to the Articulata, that the spermatozoa, nevertheless, certainly are the efficient
agents in impregnation, although full proof of the fact has been wanted. TI have
been desirous therefore of learning how far this belief can bear the test of direct
experiment, or the fact be capable of demonstration by artificial means in the Am-
phibia. As, however, the experiments I have myself made vary from those of the
authors mentioned, —have not been influenced by the result they bad previously
arrived at—have been somewhat more extended, and, as I believe, will now tend to
place the fact of the direct agency of the spermatozoa in impregnating the ovum
beyond doubt,—it has seemed desirable still to give them in detail, as assisting to
establish an important point of knowledge by facilitating a comparison of the results
of independent investigations. Duration of susceptibility.—The length of time during which the oyum, after it has
been passed, remains susceptible of fecundation, is affected by several circumstances. I bad reason to believe at the commencement of my experiment that this time is yery
short.
