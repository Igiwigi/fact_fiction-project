that, and similar respects, it is a matter of faith only. But Professor Lopce attached,
I think, too much importance to the identity of energy, as well as to another principle
he enunciated, that energy cannot be transferred without being transformed, and
conversely ; the transformation being from potential to kinetic energy or conversely.
this obviously cannot apply to the convection of energy, which is a true flux of
“energy 5 nor does it seem to apply to cases of wave motion in which the energy,
potential and kinetic, of the disturbance, is transferred through a medium unchanged
n relative distribution, simply because the disturbance itself travels without change
f type; though it may be that in the unexpressed internal actions associated with
he wave propagation there might be found a better application.
S Itis impossible that the ether can be fully represented, even merely in its trans-
Bhissive functions, by the electromagnetic equations. Gravity is left out in the cold ;
2nd although it is convenient to ignore this fact, it may be sometimes usefully
emembered, even in special electromagnetic work ; for, if a medium have to contain
‘ind transmit gravitational energy as well as sleatcchaa diotic, the proper system of
a quations should show this, and, therefore, include the electromagnetic. It seems,
‘Sherefore, not unlikely that in discussing purely electromagnetic speculations, one
ranay be within a stone’s throw of the explanation of gravitation all the time. The
Sonsummation would be a really substantial advance in scientific knowledge.
