If we suppose the function V such that ib satisfies the equation

then the surface volume integrals are the simplest poxsible in regard to results, bub it
will depend upon some other condition attached to V what class of function we shall
have 8ucceeded in integrating. For example, if V also satisfies the condition

we should be led to a class of results similar to those obtained in the case of spherical
harmonics for the sphere, and, in fact, derivable from these by the theory of correspond-
ing points. As another example, let us suppose that V, besides satisfying equation

(42), also satisfies LapLack's equation ; then one solution for V will be of the form

F(V/P=oxz+y/f—Afy+ VE —Vz

We thus get
