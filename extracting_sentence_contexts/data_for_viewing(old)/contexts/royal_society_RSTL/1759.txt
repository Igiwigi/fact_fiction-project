agate planes, as at present constructed, is a very inadequate instrument for the
delicate purposes for which it was originally intended : and a more rigid exa-
mination and adjustment of that part of the instrument are requisite, before
we can depend on the experiments made with it, either for the determination
of the length of the seconds pendulum, or even for the comparison of results
obtained in different parts of the world. The knife edge is seldom or never
perfectly straight ; the planes are seldom or never perfectly true : at least, I
have never found one 80, amongst the number of those on which I have experi-
mented. The consequence is that, as there is generally a little play in the Y's,
the knife edge is not always let down on the same parts of the agate plane.
This may be best detected by holding a lighted candle behind the knife edge
when it is resting on the plane: by which method the smallest inequalities in
the points of contact are readily discernible. But, the fact is rendered $till
more evident by reversing the pendulum in the Y's, when a sensible difference
in the result generally takes place. Amongst the numerous pendulums in my
possession, I have not met with more than one, that does not differ in the
results by an appreciable quantity, when the pendulum is reversed in the Y's,
or turned half round in azimuth. If the knife edge and planes were perfectly

correct and true, there ought not to be any difference in the results, whichever
side of the pendulum is placed fronting the observer : how then are we to
