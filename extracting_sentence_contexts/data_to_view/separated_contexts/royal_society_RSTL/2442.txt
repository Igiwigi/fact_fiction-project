Another class of physiologists maintain that the carbonic acid is formed, not in
the lungs, but in the general round of the great circulation ; in proof of which
some experimentalists have asserted that they had obtained carbonic acid from
venous blood ; but others, of equal respectability, who have repeated the same expe-
riments, deny the existence of this acid in the venous current. The air-pump has
hitherto been almost exclusively used for the purpose of deciding this question ; but
the positive proofs which have been brought forward by the one class of physiolo-
gists have been 80 completely contradicted by the negative proofs of the other, that
a great majority remains till in fayour of the old theory. In fact, TrigpeManN and
Gwe1an, the latest writers on this subject, are decidedly of opinion that venous
blood does not contain carbonic acid. As this is a very important question, the fol-
lowing experiments were made in reference to it.

put under the receiver of an air-pump.
