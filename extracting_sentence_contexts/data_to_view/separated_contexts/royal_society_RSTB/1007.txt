In the researches which have had for their subject the peripheral distribution of
fhe posterior roots of the spinal nerves, the plexuses of the Mammalian fore limb have
Seen more studied than have those pertaining to the hind limb. With the exception
af the five experiments extant by L. Turok (1856), there seem no experiments on
fe cutaneous fields of the afferent spinal roots of the Mammalian hind limb previous

the sensory roots of the four hindmost spinal nerves of that type. One general
