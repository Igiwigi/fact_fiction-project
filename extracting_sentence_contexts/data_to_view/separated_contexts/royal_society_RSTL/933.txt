Heat-applied
by an Ar6anv's lamp produced gas equal toabout half the bulk
of the charcoal; 'but as's0on as the temperature of the mercury
rose to 214‚Äù FAHRENHEIT, elastic fluid streamed from every
piece of charcoal, which quickly condensed, and 15 inch of the tube
was occupied with water. This proved that our suspicion of
the increase of weight being principally attributable to water,
was well founded. The result of these, and other experiments, plainly pointed
out the precautions which were necessary in order to obtain an
accurate result with charcoal ; for if we had weighed 4, grains
of the charcoal a few hours after it was made, we should only
in fact have had g,z grains of real charcoal, and our calculations
would have been erroneous. To avoid this source of error,
we subjected our charcoal to a red heat ?mmediately before
using_ it, and also weighed it as speedily as possible ; in fact,
while it was still warm. It may be proper to state, that our
weights were such as we could thoroughly depend upon.
