indicated above, there exist numerous specimens showing characters intermediate
between those of forms which, taken by themselves, are quite distinct. At the same
time a section taken near the tip of a leaf of one type often shows many features in
common with a section through the centre of another type. In the present paper
I have endeavoured to point out the chief variations in structure,* and there can be
little doubt that these are accompanied by variations in the form and arrangement of
the leaves. It is on the latter characters that the specific determinations of
impressions are based, and the anatomical evidence seems to be quite in favour of
the retention of these species. This, however, applies only to small specimens of the
leafy terminal branches. It is, however, possible that leaves of different types were
really produced on the same species of plant, and that the differences were due
either to the position or age of the leafy twig or to the physical conditions of
growth. Beyond the fact that the leaves on thicker stems were always larger and
more numerous there is little evidence on this point. The question can only be
settled by the collection and examination of a great number of larger and more
complete specimens than those which we have hitherto had at our disposal. It is
quite possible, too, that the leaves on the stems bearing cones had a slightly
different structure from the young foliage leaves, but here, again, many more
specimens are needed.

Turning now to other aspects of the subject, we see that, as a rule, the develop-
ment of sclerenchymatous fibres corresponds with the length of the leaf. In the
shorter species (Â¢f: Charzeformis) the fibres are only conspicuous near the apex, but
in the longer ones a strand of fibres runs through the whole length. Again, among
