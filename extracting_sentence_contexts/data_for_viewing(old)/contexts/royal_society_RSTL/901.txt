how much more concise it is than even the abbreviated statement
of the old process. (See HuTToN's Course.)

The 5tation of 1, 2, &c. numeral places respectively, which
the closing addends occupy in advance of the preparatory
ones, is an obvious consequence of combining the numeral
relation of the successive root-figures with the potential rela-
tion of the successive derivees. In fact, as is usual in arith-
metic, we tacitly regard the last root-figure as units, and the
new one as a decimal fraction; then the common rules of
decimal addition and multiplication regulate the vertical ali-
neation of the addends.

26. The advantage of mental verification is common to the
solution of equations of every order, provided the successive
corrections of the root be simple digits: for the parenthetic
derivations will, in that case, consist of multiplying a given
number by a digit, and adding the successive digital products
to the corresponding digits of another given number ; all
which may readily be done without writing a figure interme-
