analogous to an objective molecular structure is the set of deformations yj,..., yj, defined as
above, such that for each x € T and each z € R there is an orthogonal tensor Q; depending on x

For typical origami structures, we would also impose the continuity and invertibility (if S
possible) of y. Also, for classic origami y is piecewise rigid, but this need not be the case. : gS
The definitions (1.1)-(1.3) are not so convenient for the design of structures or molecules. In : 3
fact, they imply a more useful underlying group structure. We first observe that real atomistic ‘2

structures are discrete, and we add this to the definition of an objective structure: the structure
contains no accumulation points. We consider an objective molecular structure S defined by (1.2).
We consider isometries, written in conventional notation (Q|c), Q € O(8) and ce R3. Next, we
define the isometry group of S as the set of all (Q|c) such that

(Qle)(xk,c) = Oxke +C=XK0, kK=1,...,N, €=1,...,M, (1.4)

where /7(-,-) is a permutation on two indices that preserves species in the sense given above. The
natural group product associated with this definition is composition of mappings
