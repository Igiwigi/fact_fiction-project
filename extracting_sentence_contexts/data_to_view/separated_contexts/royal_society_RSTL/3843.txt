The separation of most, of the bases in a solid form, will of course tend to produce
heat, and as this will vary with different precipitates, the numbers for the insoluble
bases cannot be exactly compared with one another. The amount of the latent heat
due to precipitation is unknown, but it must be the same whenever the same preci-
pitate is formed, The correction for this cause will, therefore, be a constant quantity
for the salts of the same base, and if applied, could not affect the equality of the
foregoing groups of numbers. It is important to observe, that, notwithstanding the
heat due to the formation of the precipitates, a diminution of temperature occurs
when potash is substituted for lime or magnesia,

On a first view this Jast fact appears to prove that potash is a less powerful thermal
base than lime or magnesia, but a closer examination will show that it is at least
premature to draw such a conclusion. It must be remembered that we are imper-
fectly acquainted with all the chemical changes which accompany the snbstitutions

under consideration. We know that the substituting base existed in the state of a
hydrate before mixture, and that after mixture the displaced base is also obtained in
the same state.
