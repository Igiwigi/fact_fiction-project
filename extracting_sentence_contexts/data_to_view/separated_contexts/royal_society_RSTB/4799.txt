Wiix1s.*

If any conclusions stated in this Introduction or in the body of the paper seem to be
too confident, or at all dogmatic, I hope the reader will attribute the appearance to
inadvertence of wording, or a simple desire to avoid the wearisome reiteration of qualifying
phrases. I have no desire at all to be dogmatic: but Dr. Wiixis’s conclusions do
appear to me to explain a great range of facts, to be natural and reasonable in themselves,
and to present for the first time a conception of evolution at once so simple and so
definite that it can be expressed—even if only roughly owing to the gaps in our knowledge
—in quantitative terms, and quantitative deductions drawn. Admitting all the diffi-
culties of interpreting some results (Section [V)—and as I have said, they are considerable
—these may yield to further work, to the co-operation of biologists with more competent
mathematicians, or more likely still to the mathematically trained biologist. I may
be optimistic, but it seems to me that the future holds the possibility of great develop-
ments.
