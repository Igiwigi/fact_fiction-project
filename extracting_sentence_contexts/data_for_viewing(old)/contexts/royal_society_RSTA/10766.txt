So much for the rays deflected by a magnet. We have still to consider the rays
which are not deflectable.

well obeyed by the other gases, that there is large and unexplained discrepancy between the values
found for the relative conductivity of hydrogen under Réntgen rays by J. J. THoMSON and PERRIN
respectively, although their determinations agree fairly well in most other cases,


OF GASES UNDER THE BECQUEREL RAYS. 525

In the first place, it will be seen that all the compounds examined gave very
nearly the same values for the relative conductivities, There is, in fact, no clear
evidence of any difference between them in this respect. This result naturally
suggests the conclusion that all these substances give absorbable rays of the same
physical nature. Secondly, it will be seen that the non-deflectable rays give some-
what different results from the deflectable ones; these differences being well outside
the errors of experiment. For the former, the departure from the law of proportion-
ality is decidedly more marked than for the latter.

A reference to the table will show that these rays give results much closer to the
deflectable rays than to the Réntgen rays. The very large conductivities charac-
teristic of compounds of sulphur and the halogens under Rintgen rays are not met
with in the case of Becquerel rays of any kind.
