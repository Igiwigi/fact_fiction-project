best acquainted, for we know nothing as yet of the fructification of its contemporary,
S. insigne. Yet it is highly complex, perhaps more so than any Calamarian, and
certainly more so than any known Lycopod. As we have seen, it combines the
characters of the two groups in a striking way. We may hazard the inference that
Cheirostrobus as well as Sphenophyllum sprang from a very old stock, which existed
prior to the divergence of the Lycopods and Calamarians. This common stock
survived for a certain period side by side with these two divergent branches—
between them, as it were. Sphenophyllum is a group which had advanced very far
along this third line of descent, so that its common characters with the other lines
have become comparatively obscure. Chezrostrobus has retained more of the common
character, though reaching a high degree of complexity on its own lines.

This interpretation is of course highly hypothetical, but the fact stands firm that
this early type of cone, while having much in common with Sphenophyllum, is at
once more Calamarian and more Lycopodiaceous in character than that genus.

It must be remembered that in discussing the fructification of Sphenophyllum we
are in some danger of generalizing from too few examples. The type of S, Dawsoni
