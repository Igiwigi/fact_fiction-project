mean (CV = 57.7), which is what we would expect if attribute

values were chosen at random (see [14] for full discussion).

Higher CVs may be indicative of deliberate attempts to make (c) Case study

each object distinct (e.g. a social preference for self-expression Projectile points from the Henderson site (figures 1 and 2; N=
or functional need for hunters’ points to be differentiable). 1029) are of two primary types: Washita (28%) and Fresno


Table 1. Summary statistics for Washita points from the Henderson site. The rows labelled ‘CV = 10% (5%, 3%)’ list percentages of simulated variances
greater than the archaeological variance when simulated using the corresponding CV. Weight is measured in grams; all linear measurements are in millimetres.
Differences in attribute sample size owe to the fact that several of the points in the Henderson collection are broken. To maximize the data available for study,
any point complete in a particular dimension (e.g. width) was included in analysis of that dimension. For example, points with broken tips were not included
in analyses of maximum length but, if their bases were intact, their widths were included.
