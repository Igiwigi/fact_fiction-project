133. After some hours the germinal vesicle is found to have left its situation at the
surface of the yelk and to be returning to its centre, from whence it came. About
the same time I have observed to have arisen from the surface of the germinal spot
a membrane—that is, a vesicle—which speedily enlarged s0 as to apply itself to the
inner surface of the germinal vesicle. The vesicle thus proceeding from the spot, of
course imbibed the fluid of the germinal vesicle, which in its new situation appeared
finely granulons, and yellowish-brown in colour. The germinal vesicle having now
two membranes, was less transparent, and less easily ruptured than before ; and I have

observed what appeared to be the further effect of this additional membrane, in the
vesicle remaining visible, casting a shadow, and even not at all collapsing after being
ruptured (Plate V. fig. 92.).

134. The germinal spot, previously on the internal surface of the germinal vesicle,
is 800n observed to occupy its centre; presenting thus the same change in relation to
the germinal vesicle, as the latter undergoes in reference to the yelk-ball. 'Phe spot
