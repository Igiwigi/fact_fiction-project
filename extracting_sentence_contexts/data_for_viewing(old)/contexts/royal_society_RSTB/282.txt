aghtly so termed) of “ irritability,” all that remains is to inquire what his attitude is
regards the phenomena themselves. Does he deny them, or simply decline to
Beognise their bearing? The answer will be found in Lecture 37, in which, in
“mmenting on my observations as to the electrical concomitant of the reaction, he
ts forth his theory of its nature. Inritation produces migration of water—migration
q water, electrical disturbance. He admits, therefore, the existence of an electrical
sd consequent on excitation, but in accounting for it strangely disregards its
me relations, forgetting that it has time to accomplish itself twice at least before its
Bipposed cause comes into existence, and that its intensity is out of all proportion

eater than that of the osmotic currents with which he identifies it. Happily,

though some facts relating to the subject are perplexing, it is very easy for any one
who has at his command the common appliances of a physiological laboratory, if he is
not satisfied with my experiments, to observe himself all that is necessary to prove
the impossibility of Professor Sacus’ position.

It being once admitted that the excitatory process in the leaf is of the same nature
as that which follows stimulation in animal structures, and more particularly in nerve,
and organs belonging to the nervous system, there is reason for hoping that, j ust as
the study of the excitatory process in animals affords a secure basis for its investiga-
