The older walls in this region show a tendency to an arrangement of the threads
in shallow pits (fig. 23 (a) ). The change in direction of the threads in this cork
cambium when compared with the rest of the cortex is very marked, and the radial
arrangement is obviously due to the fact that the cells which have become meri-
stemmatic have originated by tangential division. The radial threads are here persistent, and appear to be of value in conveying food
material and water to the developing cork, On the radial walls of the cork cambium

* It is possible that a somewhat analogous arrangement may also exist in the xylem.
