But the differences between the values for the same direction of the three salts are
much smaller ; in the case of the direction of the amis b, the difference is only one per
cent., und in that of the axis a where the greatest divergence is shown, it is only six
per cent, of the total amount of expansion. The increment of the coefficient of expansion, per degree of temperature, is about
twice as large for the direction of the axis c of each salt as for the other two axial
directions, for which the inerement is nearly identical. Tt is interesting to point out, in connection with the last fact, that it agrees in a
remarkable manner with the observation previously recorded (‘ Journ. Chem, Soc.,’
Trans., 1894, p. 715, §14), that the change of optical refractive power brought about
by rise of temperature is considerably greater for the direction of the axis ¢, than
for the directions of the a and 6 axes, along which the amount of change is approxi-
mately the same. The fact that the differences of expansion exhibited by the three salts are so small,
compared with the differences in the amounts of expansion in the three axial
directions, would render it probable that if any considerable changes were introduced
in the relations of the values for these three directions by the replacement of one metal
by another, particularly if such changes were not simply proportional to the atomic
weight of the metal but expressed by a higher function of the atomic weight, such
change would suffice to negative the possibility of a direct progression of the linear
coeflicients of expansion for each axial direction of the three salts, corresponding
to the atomic weights of the metals present.
