It not only
explains the situation of the tumour, the want of connection
with the body of the gland, and the narrowness of its base
where that is met with, but it solves what has ever appeared
to me the greatest difficulty, how it should protrude into the
cavity of the bladder. This arises from the hard substance' of
the coats of the vasa deferentia being in close contact, and
bound down upon this lobe, so that from its first enlargement
it must immediately-press up the inner membrane of the
bladder, which can make very little resistance. This lobe of the prostate gland, from its situation and -con-
nection with the vasa deferentia, is liable to'many causes of
swelling, which the body of the gland itself is free from ; for
every irritation upon the seminal vessels or their orifices may
be communicated to it by continuity of parts: and aged men,
from an ignorance' of these facts, are too often, through im-
prudence, producing an excitement in those'vessels which the
parts are unable to support ; and when this is long continued,
inflammation becomes the consequence, which cannot take
place to any degree without being communicated to this lobe,
and producing an enlargement of it. Every violent effort which is made to empty the urinary
bladder produces an unusual pressure against this lobe, by
which it may be injured. There is also much reason for be-
lieving, that the diseased state of the lateral parts of the gland,
s0 very commonly met with in the latter period of life, has
its origin in this particular lobe ; 'since in most of the cases
of a diseased state of the gland, which have come under my
observation after death, this lobe has been enlargedin a

greater degree in proportion to its size than any other part ;
and in some instances the enlargement of it has been very
great, while it appeared to be only beginning in the lateral
portions.
