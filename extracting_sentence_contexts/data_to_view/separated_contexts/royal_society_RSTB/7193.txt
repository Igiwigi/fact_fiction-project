Not only has Thomas Young’s theory played
an essential part in the growth of new methods of colour reproduction, but in precise colour
measurement as well. Also it provided a most valuable classification for the colour-blind. So that, even if it should prove to be a fact that human vision is not trichromatic, and that
Young’s theory has had its day, yet the heritage which it will leave behind will continue
for many years to come, in practical applications of many kinds, possibly even colour
television.

(142) Colour mixture determinations

Some years ago the author collected all the evidence available at that time, for and
against Young’s three-colour theory, because it had been noticed that many observers,
using different methods for investigating a wide range of visual phenomena, had found the
basis of three primary sensations insufficient to account completely for their experimental
results. That evidence, which consisted of notes, reference cards and reprints, was destroyed
by fire when incendiary bombs were dropped on the City of London in 1942. The evidence
thus having been destroyed, all that remain are recollections of a few experimenters and
their more important conclusions.
