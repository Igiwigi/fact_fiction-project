On a former occasion I found that a like, short, thick, black crystal lost
part of its power by the heat of a spirit-lamp flame, but on cooling, the tourmaline
became very magnetic, pointed axially, and was strongly attracted. The latter
effects were traced to a portion of peroxide of iron on one part of the crystal, which
had been reduced to protoxide or even lower, by the vapour and heat of the spirit-
lamp: digestion in hydrochloric acid removed this iron and restored the crystal to
its first condition. The fact shows, that a temperature which takes away the high
paramagnetic condition of iron or its protoxide could not destroy the peculiar con-
dition of tourmaline as a magnecrystal,

3411. Carbonate of iron.—The crystal of this substance before described (3379.)
was suspended in an oil bath, and carried through temperatures varying from 4®
to 293%. Its upsetting angle was 96%.
