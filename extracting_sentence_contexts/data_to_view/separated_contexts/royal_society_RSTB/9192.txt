Our present observations suggest that the composition of
the cocktail of growth factors released by glia after stimulation
with thyroid hormone [9] could fine-tune Na* current density
in neurons. The clinically observed variability of the suscepti-
bility of the brains of different subjects to hypothyroidism
might thus not only be explained by polymorphisms in thyroid
hormone transporters in the blood-brain barrier [53] but
might also result from variations in the growth factor
composition released from astrocytes.

(a) Na™ current density and immune responses

As inflammatory processes in the central nervous system may
lead to epileptic seizures [33,34,54] and because an upregula-
tion of Na‘ current density has been implicated in the
development of neuropathic pain [55], we also tested whether
inflammatory signals accompanying microglia activation
could influence Na* current density in hippocampal neurons. In fact, the addition of 5 or 10% surplus microglial cells to the
culture for 4 days significantly increased the Na‘ current
density (figure 4b,c). An activation of microglia by LPS, as
occurs during bacterial infections, induced a stronger regu-
lation than observed in a co-culture with microglia alone
(figure 4c). As it is known that microglia release factors such
as interleukins and tumour necrosis factor upon activation by
LPS (e.g. [20]), we tested whether pre-incubation with TNF-a
for 4 days mimics the effect of LPS-stimulated microglia.
