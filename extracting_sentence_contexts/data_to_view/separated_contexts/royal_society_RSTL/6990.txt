imagination to diftate his firſt letter to Dr, Mortimer;
and that what he then ſent, he rather hoped would
prove true upon experiment, than what really was

outas he had repreſented it? But be that as it may ; as
ſucceſs both here and abroad has been wanting to the
endeavours of thoſe, who have deſired to repeat theſe

from an undiſguiſed repreſentation of the facts, as
they have appeared to me, I ſhall leave every one

to deduce his own concluſion concerning the reality
of them. XXXV. An Account of the Biſhop of Lno-
