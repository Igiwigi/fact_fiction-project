bands [10,11].

Previous studies have focused on the identification of carotenoids in pure cultures of
different microorganisms using the resonance Raman effect. In this way, trace pigment detection
is sometimes possible using especially the excitation wavelengths 514.5 and 532nm [12-14].
Carotenoids can also be identified in native samples from surface or subsurface colonizations
of rocks or sediments using Raman spectroscopy.

Interesting new possibilities have become available by the use of portable instruments
that allow obtaining Raman spectra under field conditions. Other studies have used Raman
spectroscopy to detect carotenoids in native samples from surface or subsurface colonizations of
rocks or sediments. These studies have high relevance for geobiology and exobiology [15-23]. In
fact, Raman spectrometer in a miniaturized version was proposed to be included onboard a rover
to be part of the forthcoming projects of astrobiological priority on Mars [1,17]. Biosignatures of
preexisting life, as well as mineral associations confirming the presence of water on Mars in the
past, are the main objects of interest to be detected by Raman spectroscopic instrumentation. As
biomarkers, pigments and especially carotenoids are of highest relevance.

In this paper, Raman spectra of different carotenoids from representative species of
archaea, bacteria, cyanobacteria and algae were obtained. The Raman spectroscopic approach
was compared with HPLC of extracts. It was shown that carotenoids can very easily
be detected within lyophilized biomass. However, the ability of conventional Raman
spectrometry to detect individual carotenoids when present in complex microbiological matrices
is limited.
