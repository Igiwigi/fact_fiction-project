volume at infinite dilution, the expressions we obtained in Part II. (c) may be written

forKCl. . .-. . . . . 8V,=.0059(1—y),
for NaCl . 3... . .-. OV, =0°089 (1=y);

where y = (1+ Bh~**)~*, B having the value 6 for KCl and 4 for NaCl. At infinite
dilution for KCl, V, = 0°3068, and for NaCl, V, = 0°2125.

By means of these formule we can calculate the solution volumes corresponding
to the concentrations at which Jany’s freezing-point observations were made, and
we find, as our theory led us to anticipate, that the effective molecular freezing-point

depression is in fact a linear function of the solution volume calculated from the
densities.
