adjusting both rotor speed and blade pitch angle, in a nonlinear manner.

Differences in fatigue loads for time series with the same second-order properties show that
phase relationships are important. The simulations with the spectral model, which implements
randomized phases, clearly demonstrate this. It seems that without a more detailed rotor
simulation it is quite difficult to model rotor loads of sufficient quality that an accurate fatigue
assessment can be performedâ€”in marked contrast to the situation for simpler support structures
such as monopiles, where frequency domain methods can give relatively accurate estimates.
The only exception might be data-driven or resampling approaches that reuse parts of earlier
thrust time series. These are not considered here since they do not increase our understanding of
rotor loads.

In fact, ideally we would like to obtain a model with only a few parameters that can be used to
generate realistic rotor load signals. The main use of such a model would be as a starting point for
a probabilistic analysis. One of the main challenges for structural optimization of wind turbine
support structures is the sheer amount of time-domain simulations needed for a comprehensive
assessment, which borders on the region of a few thousands [2,5]. It would be highly welcome to
obtain a more efficient, yet still highly accurate, way of predicting fatigue damage in a support
structure. Madsen & Frandsen [6] made a pioneering effort in this respect, introducing formulae
for fatigue damage based on the Rice formula, that actually needs to be re-evaluated for current
larger turbines and offshore support structures. Combined with the use of simplified models
for support structure dynamics such as in [27], more efficient structural assessments should
be possible.
