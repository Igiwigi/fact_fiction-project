‘coelomic fluid when poured upon the skin of the worm stimulates the mucous glands
to discharge by reason of its alkaline reaction. Be this as it may, there is formed
from the coelomic fluid and from the product of the mucous glands a slime possessing
considerable complexity of structure, and which in addition to active phagocytes,
contains sticky threads of mucin which form a complicated network ready to entangle
any parasite that endeavours to bore its way through the skin.

That the ccelomic fluid is sometimes used by the earthworm to lubricate or moisten
its body is very probable, and Spencer has called our attention to this fact. But
that this is its only function is very improbable. Thus we see that in most terrestrial
Qnelids* the coelomic fluid possesses remarkable functions in virtue of the presence
ofdorsal pores. The latter structures are therefore of great physiological significance,
agi, with the coelomic fluid and the mucin-forming glands of the skin, they constitute
af important mechanism for the protection of the animals against the inroads of
