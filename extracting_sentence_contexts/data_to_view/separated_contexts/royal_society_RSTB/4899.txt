Tt is true that on the actual readings the difference in reaction was
slight, but of two samples of blood exposed to 25 mm. oxygen which give the same
readings by this method, that which contains the greater number of corpuscles will be
the more alkaline (see Appendix II). As this result appears to be in conflict with
the researches of Warburg, it will be wise to leave open the question as to whether
the reaction of the blood is unchanged or becomes slightly more alkaline,

By a process of exclusion, it must be supposed that the increased activity of the
respiratory centre is the result—direct or indirect—of oxygen want on the centre
itself. The fall of CO, in the alveolar air is the effect, and so also in the relative rise
in oxygen,

When exercise is taken, a given amount of exercise is found to produce a greater rise
in the hydrogen-ion concentration in rare than in ordinary air, hence the urgency of
the breathlessness which supervenes is due to the fact that there is not only a more
irritable respiratory centre but a greater increment of hydrogen-ions, 7.¢. a greater
stimulus acting upon it. ‘

Above the three main factors in acclimatisation ((a), (b) and (c) above) were pro-
visionally treated as independent variables; in reality they are not so, for blood can
be made artificially to resemble high-altitude blood, by shaking out the CO,,
centrifugalising and then withdrawing a portion of the plasma so that the blood
is richer in corpuscles, Such blood has been found to give at the alveolar CO,
pressure of the Andes (27 mm, CO, or thereabouts) :—
