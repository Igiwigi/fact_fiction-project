One can identify this Aas [=
being ‘pseudo-finitely generated’ by a pair of operators U'/# and V'/”, for non-standard integers [3
py and v. By construction, the integers jz and v have a property of being divisible by all standard :8
integers. This property is equivalent to the fact that A is an upper bound for Agin, i.e. A C A for any :s
rational A. Now, we take the corresponding ultraproduct modulo D of Zariski geometries V4 (1) 1G
and denote it Vj (1).
