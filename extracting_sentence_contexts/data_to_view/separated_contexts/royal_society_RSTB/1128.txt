We have seen that
similar evidence in the case of the nerve fibres in the cord shows that in them also the
fect is propagated from the stimulated region indifferently either towards the centre
or the periphery, and it follows from the combination of these two, that if any fibres
p a nerve are directly continuous with those in the cord, the excitatory changes
following stimulation of these must be propagated along the whole length of the
continuous strand and may thus travel out into the fibres of the nerve. Direct
sontinuity has been shown to exist by the degeneration method between the
ibres of the posterior root and those of certain portions of the posterior
gymns, hence it is not surprising that the stimulation of the posterior columns in
Is cord should eause electrical changes in the posterior root due to the arrival in the

hannels. :

The simplest of these are the efferent (motor) nerves, and it has already been
tated that, as regards these, Chapter IX., Section 2, the corpuscular connection is of
uch a character that, whilst allowing the passage of impulses from the cord to the
1erves, it appears to completely block the passage of impulses from the nerves
nto the cord. (See also Chapter XI., Section 2 (1).) The stimulation of a mixed
herve (the posterior roots being divided) or an anterior root thus evokes impulses which
travel up and break upon the shore of the nerve corpuscles, and either remain on
