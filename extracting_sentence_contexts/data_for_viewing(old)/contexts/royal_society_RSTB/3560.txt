of graphically recording the progressive results of our work, and also, as the plates
accompanying this memoir show, of final illustration. We are not unconscious of the
fact that in so doing we sacrifice the opportunity, which the ordinary drawing affords,
of rendering certain points diagrammatically clear. The drawings that we have
thought it advisable to reproduce as plates will show that our decision to trust
mainly to photographic reproduction was in no way forced upon us. But not a few

of the facts recorded in the following pages seem to us of such critical interest as to
demand the utmost degree of objectivity in their presentation. For this we have
been content to rely upon the modern methods of photographic reproduction from our
untouched photographs.

4isthetically considered, no doubt, photographs, with their frequently dingy or
spotty backgrounds, and variegated with out-of-focus patches, may seem vastly
inferior to the careful and finished drawing. From the scientific point of view, on
the other hand, it is difficult to see what can be urged against the photograph when
questions of evidence are involved, provided that it definitely affords the evidence it
purports to supply. It is certainly devoid of the subjective element which pervades
even a camera-lucida drawing. For merely didactic purposes, of course, a totally
