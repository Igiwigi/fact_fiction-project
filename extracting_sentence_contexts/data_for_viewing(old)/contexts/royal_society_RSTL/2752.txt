at two particular times in the lunation the difference will yanish. The times of moon's
transit for which the diurnal difference vanishes, correspond to the times when the
moon is in the equator, and are therefore different at different seasons of the year.
Now from the general correspondence of the phenomena of the tides with the equi-
librium-theory, we may expect that the cireumstances of the diurnal inequality will
be the same as those which have been described ; but that the time when the diurnal
inequality vanishes will not be the time when the moon is in the equator, but some
time afterwards,

4. By the statements above referred to on this subject it appears that the time at
which the diurnal difference vanishes is when the moon's transit takes place about
9% 30” in January, and two hours earlier in each sueceeding month, taking the general
average of the facts. Now in the middle of January the sun is 49 30” from the vernal
equinox, and hence the moon is 5* beyond the equinox when the diurnal inequality

vanishes. The same result would be obtained from the other months, since the sun's
right ascension increases on an average two hours in each month*. Hence the
evanescence of the diurnal inequality which, in the equilibrium-spheroid, would take
place when the moon is in the equator, does not take place till she has described 5%
of right ascension after that time, and this requires six days and a quarter,

5. In the inequalities hitherto considered, which were the effects of the sun, and of
