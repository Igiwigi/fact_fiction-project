away. I lacked the knowledge to devise my own program, and it took me a year
until I found out that Samar Hasnain at the Hamburg synchrotron had a suitable
program and was willing to evaluate my data.


Max Perutz’s view on the James Lauterbrunner (in real life Peter Eisenberger) result was that
his theory of a stereochemical mechanism was dead. Typical of him, not knowing the technique,
he set about making arrangements for doing the XAFS measurements on a sample prepared
by himself. He recruited his friends worldwide to get the measurements done at the Stanford
Synchrotron in May 1980 on BL15 and BL23. But Max then faced the problem of data analysis.
This luckily brought him to me in late 1980 when I had joined Daresbury as a staff scientist. I was
aware of the controversy and had learnt of the difficulties of anyone looking at the data in the
USA, for fear of harming their career. In fact, an Englishman who had done his PhD at Stanford
was at the EMBL in Hamburg at the time; he could have analysed the data but decided not to, as
he did not wish to rule out the possibility of working in the USA.

Over the next nine months, I rigorously analysed the data using the most accurate curved
wave implementation of EXAFS theory where it took overnight computation on the best IBM
computer available at Daresbury (Daresbury was one of the major national computer centres at
the time) to complete a single iteration for a fraction of the XAFS data range. In May 1981,
had the result, which confirmed the original EXAFS structural parameters. This compelled me
to think where the problem regarding the lack of movement of iron from the porphyrin plane
in Eisenberger’s study might originate. I set about looking at all of the chemical porphyrin
compounds that had been used for comparison and as standards in the original study and
our own. The answer was obvious—Eisenberger had used the triangulation method where the
