This centralized position of the sexual structures is peculiar to the genera Nais and
Tumbricus. Tn every other Annelid, Planaria forming no exception, every segmenta]
organ in the body is enlisted in the office of reproduction.

+ There is nevertheless some peculiar power resident in the ordinary segmental organs.
S Towards the end of the summer these worms (Naides) divide themselves by fission,
© generally into two parts. The normal reproductive masses are always in the anterior
half. The tail-half at this time has no sexual system; but in process of time two of the
S ciliated tubes will swell, enlarge in size, and at the same time become more complex
Sin 8tructure. It is evidently the EPFoRT in the tail-half to reconstruct itself into a per-
Sect individual. That it does become a perfect individual the author has never been
Sable to prove by his own observations. The fact is here adduced to prove that there
does reside in the segmental organ a power which enables it (the conditions being favour-
Sable) to transform itself into an ovary or a testis.
S The ciliated tubes in various species of Nais have of late years been obseryed and
-Zdescribed by several anatomists, e. g. by HENLE, UDEKEM, SIEBOLD, LEYDIG, GEGENBAUER
Sand others. No one has hitherto, however, attempted to connect them with the repro-
