formless granules. The diverticula of the digestive system are $0 arranged as to be
Surrounded within by the peritoneal fluid and without by the external water, which
is drawn in through the meshes of the felt. This arrangement proves obviously that
the contents of the digestive czca are expressly in this Annelid exposed to the action
of the two fluids described. These © contents” consist of a dark olive fluid, and
though destitute of organic bodies, is endowed with nutritive properties.

In this Annelid, therefore, as in the Leech, the fluid contained in the digestive $ac-
culi is the true equivalent of the chylaqueous fluid of the peritoneal cavity of other
Species. In the Leech this latter cavity is almost obliterated, in Aphrodita it is
spacious and occupied by a fluid, colourless and limpid as water. Moreover, in
Aphrodita, the peritoneal cavity is distinguished from that of air other Annelids by
the fact that it is lined by vibratile epithelium, in which respect it is allied to the
Echinoderms. The fluid which fills the digestive cazca in Aphrodita contains no
determinately organized solid bodies, another respect in which it resembles that of
the diverticula of the stomach of the Starfish. The blood-proper in this aberrant
Annelid is perfectly fluid, devoid, that is, of all morphotic elements, and yellowish in
colour.

In no case in the animal kingdom is the physiologist presented with a more favour-
able opportunity for determining the real meaning of the floating cells of the nutri-
tive fluids than that which occurs in the Annelida. Here nature performs for him
the difficult experiment of separating the albumen and fibrine-producing from the
colour-producing parts of the vital fluids. It has been demonstrated that in every
Annelid the chylaqueous fluid is more or less corpusculated. In every species this
