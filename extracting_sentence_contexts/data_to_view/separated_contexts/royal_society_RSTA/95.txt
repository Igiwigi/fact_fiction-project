It also relates the abundance of light particles to that of a specific
range of primary fragments, namely those with z = 40 and z = 60 approximately, and this
may in principle be determined by other means (Plutonium Project Report 1946). In conclusion, it may be noted that the emission of light nuclei in fission should not be
confined to the slow neutron induced fission of U2, but should occur also in fission of other
elements. Farwell e¢ al. (1947) have in fact already reported the emission of long-range
particles in the fission of plutonium Pu2%° by slow neutrons, and further experiments to
detect the effect in fission of U238, Th28?, etc., may be expected. Weare indebted to Professor N. Feather for much helpful advice and criticism throughout
this work, and to Dr W. E. Burcham and Mr J. Dainty for valuable discussions. We wish to
