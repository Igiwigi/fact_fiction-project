between its constituent molecules. It would be difficult to cause such a germ to imbibe
the moisture necessary to produce the swelling and softening which precede its destruction
in a liquid of high temperature.

In my last paper I made some remarks upon. this subject *; and in relation to our
present experiments, the influence of drying and hardening was brought home to me
by the fact that in all the foregoing cases the infusions which five minutes” boiling proved
sufficient to sterilize were, without exception, derived from fresh hay mown in 1876,
while the infusions which five minutes boiling failed to sterilize were derived, without
exception, from old hay mown either in 1875 or 80me previous year.

In the earlier experiments of the present inquiry this distinction between old and
new hay came most clearly and definitely out. 'The result was subsequently blurred
by circumstances which it required time and labour to unravel, and which will require
patience on the reader's part if he would follow them through all their monotonous
obstructiveness. They will, however, throw far more light upon the real character of
these inquiries, and do more to reconcile the discords to which they have given birth,
than if every experiment had been a success unshaded by doubt.
