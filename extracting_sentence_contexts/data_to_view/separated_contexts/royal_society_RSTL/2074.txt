Society did. me. the honour to. receive in a very
favourable manner ; and which, by offering a class of new
and powerful agents, led me away for many years into a
field of pure chemical enquiry : and it is only lately, and on
an occasion which is well known, that I have again taken up
the subject of the general principles of electro-chemical
action. After a number of new experiments, which I shall
have the pleasure,of laying before the Society, and notwith-
standing the various novel views which have been brought
forward in this and in other countries, and the great activity
and extension of science, it is peculiarly satisfactory, to me to
find that I have nothing to alter in the fundamental theory
laid down in my original communication ; and which, after a
lapse of twenty years, has continued, as it was in the begin-
ning, the guide and foundation of all my researches. I am the more inclined to bring forward these new labours
at the present moment, though they are far from being in a

finished state, because the discovery of OtrsTeD and that of
Moricnrni, illustrated by some late ingenious enquiries,
connect the electro-chemical changes with entirely new
classes of facts, and induce a hope that many of the compli-
cated phenomena of corpuscular changes, now obscure, will
ultimately be found to depend upon the same causes, and to
be governed by the same laws; and that the simplicity of
our scientific arrangements will increase with every advance
in the true knowledge of nature. II. Some historical details.
