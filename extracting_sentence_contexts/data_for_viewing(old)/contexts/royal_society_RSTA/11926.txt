the band spectrum is higher than that indicated by the amount of the displacement
as existing in sunspots, a lower pressure may suffice for the formation of’ the titanium
oxide flutings.

The transition from the banded to a continuous spectrum remains for. discussion,
Sonuster and others have suggested that increase of pressure should ultimately
produce a continuous spectrum. For metalloids it is known that such is the case: if
the pressure of hydrogen in a yacuum tube is gradually increased the lines broaden
until the resulting spectrum is continuous. Harriry,* discussing the fluted flame
spectrum of silver, puts an idea of ScHusrer’s (‘ Brit. Assoc. Report,’ 1880) into the
following words :—‘ Thus we see that there is really no essential difference between
the constitutions of the matter which enters into vapours of metals and metalloids ;
there is, in fact, something in their constitution common to both which is apparently
dependent upon their vapour pressures, and probably due to the actions of the
molecules upon one another when their mean path is so extended that their motions
become rhythmical. Reduce the freedom of their motions and the result is a
continuous spectrum.”

The results of the present experiments bear out this conclusion, and the develop-
ment of the banded into a continuous spectrum is regarded as the outcome of the
widening of the individual bands.

It remained to be seen if this banded spectrum were identical with any known
spectrum of silver. Harriry had investigated the flame spectrum and had photo-
graphed flutings, but not in the region of the spectrum under present observation,
