The classic science fiction example of a temporal information loop is the story of a physicist who
has been trying, without success, to build a time machine. Then, when he has become sufficiently
frustrated as to be just about ready to toss the whole business in the trash, a silent visitor (who
bears a remarkable resemblance to our hero) appears on the physicist’s doorstep, hands him a
thick notebook and leaves. In the notebook are detailed instructions, written in a bold hand, in
ink, on how to build a time machine.
