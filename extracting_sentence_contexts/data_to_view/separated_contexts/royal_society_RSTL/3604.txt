As explanatory of the foregoing paragraph, I may perhaps
be permitted to mention some appearances that have since fallen under my notice. It is necessary, however, to apprise the reader that the remarkable appearances about
to be detailed are not all of them to be always found ; and indeed that sometimes most
if not all of them are absent. To what circumstances their presence or their absence
5 is to be attributed, it would be premature at this time to speculate, without facts that
are $till wanted regarding the action of the atmospheric air upon the blood-corpuscles
in their passage through the lungs ; and some unknown change which, from obser-
vations not yet completed, I am inclined to think these corpuscles undergo in that
portion cf the circulating fluid which passes throngh the liver. Neither am I in pos-
ses8ion of facts connected with the process of digestion, which may possibly influence
the reproduction of the blood-corpuscle ; supposing this reproduction to be effected
in the way suggested by the observations of the foregoing paper, and my previous
memoirs. And here I am reminded to mention, that some of the animals from which
the blood in question (after death) was taken, had not received food for many hours
previously, Such were the sheep at the London slanghter-houses.
