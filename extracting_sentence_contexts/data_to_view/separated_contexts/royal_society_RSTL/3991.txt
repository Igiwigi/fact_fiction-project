On one side we have the two opposite states of electricity, the tension of both of
which anust, increase at the extremities of each prism in proportion to the number of
elementary organs of which it is composed ; on the other hand, we have opposite
magnetic 8tates, the strength of which at the poles is also proportional to the number
of magnetic elements of the cylinder. Experience has in fact shown, both in the torpedo and in the gymnotus, that the
strength of the current obtained during the discharge is proportional to the length of
the prisms included in the circuit closed, I haye frequently seen, on dividing the
electric organ of the living torpedo in a plane parallel to the surface of the organ,
that: the 8um of the, currents given by the different slices of the organ were approx-
imatively equal to the current given by the entire organ, These same facts are verified
also by including different points of the electric organ of the torpedo in the circuit ;
we know, in effect, that the current is stronger when points near the median line of
the animal are touched, than when more remote points are.. Nothing is easier than

to verify upon the gymnotus the fact that the strongest discharge is that obtained on
including the entire length of the animal within the circuit. In comparing the discharge of the torpedo with that of the gymnotus, s0 far as it
is possible to do $0, it is s0mewhat surprising to see that the two discharges are not
80 far different as they should be to be in proportion to the length of the prisms in
the two animals. But anatomy furnishes us with the key to this apparent anomaly, and shows us
that the length of the prisms in the torpedo may be considered equal to that of the
gymnotus, inasmuch as the number of elementary organs in the former is at least ten
times as great as in the latter.
