- followed excitation of the electrical nerves. The fish were readily curarised in from
two to three hours by the injection of 0°5 cub. centim. of a 1 per cent. solution under
‘the dorsal skin near the tail. This being the case, it was certain that the strip of
Sieurarised organ would respond, like the uncurarised, to the passage of an induction
LSphock, as was found to be the case. It is, therefore, not improbable that the stimula-
tion of the column by an induction current is not analogous to the direct electrical
excitation of curarised muscle, but to that of nerve, it being an excitation of the
pe amerable nerye branches which pervade the transverse protoplasmic septa of the
Scolumn rather than the protoplasm of the septa. The singular curare failure would
Beem to me to point to the conclusion that an electrical organ is pre-eminently a
shstructure in which an immense number of nerve endings are grouped together into a
B system, and that the excitatory electromotive change may be nothing more than the
"B fact that when an excitatory process travels down a nerve its trunk becomes negative
eto its terminal cross-section. Although such an effect is relatively feeble in each
‘g ultimate fibril, the enormous quantity of fibrils may augment its intensity, even to the
Zheight attained by the electromotive change of an electrical column. If an electro-
motive change in the protoplasmic plates, as distinct from that in the nerves, is to be
looked for, then I venture to think that it may be found in that remarkable prolonged

& The discovery of the response of the strip of organ is entirely due to the use of
the rheotome method, for without it the induction shock masks the response. It is»
& therefore, essential to use the rheotome even in such simple experiments as those
