which is exactly the same result as that obtained by Mr. PLav-
FAIR, P. 203, on the supposition of homogeneity ; and this was

E d vanishes, and the solid becomes a plane, we must evidently

"Sd the length is evanescent.

S Nor is this observation to be confined to that particular case

2 and d=0, the equation will always be reduced to

E wx= (x +5)
