In all these experiments precautions were taken to squeeze fluid from the testes
and epididymes into the vasa deferentia before operating.

As a result of the experiments we may conclude that the spermatozoa of the
Rabbit can live for at least 10 days in the body of the male after leaving the testis
but that they die before 13 days. With regard to those cases where the sperms
were found to have died after a shorter interval, it may be pointed out that it was
not known how long they might have been living in the vasa deferentia at the time
of operating. The fact that in some cases at any rate the spermatozoa can survive
for 10 days is in conformity with the result obtained in Ewarr’s experiment, already
mentioned, in which they appear to have lived for the same period in the genital
organs of the female. On the other hand the fact that with the Rabbit and also
apparently with the Dog the duration of the sperm’s life after leaving the testis is
limited to less than 13 days, makes it all the more remarkable that in Bats according
to Ermer, vAN BenepeEN, and others, the spermatozoa regularly maintain their
vitality for many months.*

* The extreme length of life possessed by some insects’ sperms, which, in the case of Bees, are said to
survive for four or five years, is well known. (Cf. VON SIEBOLD, 1837.) LANG has lately shown (1904)
that sperms may live for three years in the vesicule seminales in Snails.—October 12.
