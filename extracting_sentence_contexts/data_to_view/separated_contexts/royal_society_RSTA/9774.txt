a much nearer approximation to equality than before ; in fact, 1950 well within all
limits. :

We are therefore led to surmise that the P series of all the alkalies can be
represented by a formula,

the numbers inserted being only very roughly approximate. In other words, the
knowledge of four constants (N, ‘486+? 195+? and k) gives all the lines of all the P
series of the alkalies (Li not considered).
