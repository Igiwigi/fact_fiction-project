Grar zu Sorms-Lavsacn makes as to the preservation of the Saalfeld plants
hold good for our own material, an interesting point, considering the great similarity
of the two floras, to which we shall often have to allude. Grar Sonms says of
Uneer’s specimens that all the cell-membranes are usually broadened in a peculiar
way, as if swollen, with, of course, a corresponding diminution of the lumen; while
the pits are lost and are often not to be recognised at all in longitudinal sections.¢
Even in transverse sections fibres and tracheal elements become, as GRAr Sous
says, “ desperately alike.”

All these difficulties are met with in our Kentucky material, though, of course,
not always in an equal degree, In some cases the tracheal sculpturing may even
be quite easily recognisable, as is the case in Periastron and Stercopteris (Plate 32,
Phots. 40 and 42). A glance through the plates will, in fact, give a better idea of
the state of preservation than any amount of description,

The investigation, owing to the peculiarities of the material mentioned above, is
more difficult than in the case of ordinary Carboniferous specimens, but with care
the limits and characters of the tissues can be sufficiently determined.

The plants described in the present paper are as follows :—

1. Calamopitys americana, sp. nov., with a Kalymma probably belonging to it, p. 317.
2. Calamopteris Hippocrepis, sp. nov., p. 330.

3. Periastron perforatum, sp. nov., p. 335.
