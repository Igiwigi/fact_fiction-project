By the aid of Chemistry it may be established—that, in the admixture of Animal food
with Bread, the relation, in estimated respiratory and fat-forming capacity, of the non-
nitrogenous to the Nitrogenous substance, will be increased ; and further—that, in sweh
a mixed diet, the proportion of the non-nitrogenous constituents which will be in the
concentrated condition, 80 to speak, of fat itself, will be considerably greater than in Bread
alone. Common experience testifies, moreover, that certain advantages are 80 derived. It is for Physiology to lend her aid to the full explanation of the facts and conclusions
which Chemistry and common usage may in their turn determine. 7 0
