phonon behaviours manifest as dark, linear features in the STCP, from which vp can be extracted
by determining the slope, the magnitude of which is then plotted as a function of time (figure 3g),
thus revealing the dispersion behaviour [5]. The data are fit with a single-exponential decay curve
to extract an asymptotic phase velocity, vp,o (equation 1).

Here, A is a pre-exponential, t is a decay constant and f is time. See the electronic
supplementary material for more details and for descriptions of various control experiments.

It is worth noting that while the STCP analyses performed here were conducted on a single,
select ROI, an inspection of the electronic supplementary material videos shows that CAPs were
in fact initiated and launched from each vacuum-specimen interface, or lamella edge, following
in situ photoexcitation. This indicates that the direction of CAP propagation is not dependent
upon crystallographic orientation. Instead, acoustic-phonon launch from morphological features,
such as step-edges and interfaces, is hypothesized to arise from a rapid dephasing of directional
phonon modes due to inherent differences in the interfacial boundary conditions at such features
and the associated influence on the lattice response following photoexcitation [6]. Indeed, rapid
dephasing of CAPs caused by crystal step-edges that are a single unit cell in height has been
observed with UEM [7]. Further, the CAPs imaged here are hypothesized to be Lamb waves,
as has been observed in single-crystal, undoped Ge [4,5]. Such guided-wave modes generally
display multiple orders in the frequency domain, most of which have hypersonic phase velocities
with strong dispersion behaviours. However, it remains an open question as to why single-mode
excitation appears to occur here and also in previous UEM studies [5]. Further, the observed
single-exponential decay of vp in the time domain (figure 3g) is subject to several explanations,
