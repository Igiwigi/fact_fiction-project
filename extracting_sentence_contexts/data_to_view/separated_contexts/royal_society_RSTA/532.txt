Then, the structure of the problem is different but the limiting system should
be the same, except the equation for the density, which implies a faster propagation of the region
Q(t). Moreover, it is formally clear from (1.10) and (1.11) that, letting v > 0, we recover the Hele-
Shaw system. However, a rigorous proof of this fact requires compactness of the sequence which
was not directly available with the method developed here. Finally, uniqueness for the limit
problem is still open. Competing interests.
