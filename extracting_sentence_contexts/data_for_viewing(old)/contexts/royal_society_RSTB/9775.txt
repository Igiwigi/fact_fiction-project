Needless to say, further studies of other gene families that 3

of inverse correlation between molecular complexity and
the degree of centralization of the NS. We are aware that
the apparent simplicity of the NS structure does not indicate

that in hydra (having another ‘simple’ NS) different subsets
of neurons in the nerve net express different neuropeptides
[82]; hence although the nerve net might look structurally
simple, in fact it is a structure that is highly (from a functional
point of view) regionalized. The X. bocki nerve net may be a
similar case.

7. Transformation from nerve nets to compact
brains in the Xenacoelomorpha: an
evolutionary scenario

Within Xenacoelomorpha, we consider the epidermal nerve

net of xenoturbellids as the ancestral condition (because of

the relative position of xenoturbellids within this group and
