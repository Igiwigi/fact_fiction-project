The uncatus series lose their spine pits almost as soon as they break off from the
Parkinsoni stem, namely, in early low-zonal times. They acquire a hump on the
exterior margin of the supero-marginalia and the forms remain low, In consequence

the profile view (Plate 11, figs. 9, 10) of the marginalia is very characteristic. The
early breaking down of the terminal supero-marginalia which takes place as early
as Marsupite times appears to prophesy a shorter life-history of the lineage as
compared with that of the Parkinsoni series, and, in fact, the lineage itself disappears
in the “ middle mucronata.”

Various forms of the lineage have been described by SuapEN and Spencer (45).

Detailed Zonal History.—The members of the lineage can first be distinguished
from those of the Parkinsoni series in the zone of Terebratulina lata. These early
forms retain a few spine pits, the abactinal tumidity on the exterior margin of the
supero-marginalia is low (Plate 11, fig. 9), and the terminal supero-marginalia are
triangular.

The chief modifications which take place in the mid-zones are due to advances
along the lines already suggested. As in the Parkinsoni series, additional components
