band becomes more prominent. However, holding the sample at this temperature for 5h does
not alter the microstructure (figure 21b). The optical image (figure 21c) and Raman spectrum
map (figure 21d) show the corresponding dark and bright phase observed in the SEM image in
figure 21b. The spectrum (figure 21e) from the darker phase shows several peaks, which matches
well with CuO of the database. However, no peak was seen from the bright region. This suggests
that the brighter region is probably copper grains. The EBSD result supports the observation from
Raman spectroscopy. The phase map image in figure 22c confirms the presence of pure Cu and
Cu20. EDS mapping of oxygen (figure 22d) showing oxygen deficiency in many grains further
validates the above results.

The presence of Cu along with CuO at high temperature might be due to the fact that above
800°C at high vacuum pressure, copper oxide transforms back to copper [35]. The oxides phase is
mostly observed at (110) orientation of Cu, while it has been almost dissolved in grains with other
orientation (figure 22b). All the Cu2O oxide particles show cube—cube ORs with matrix. The (001),
(110) and (111) planes of CuzO match perfectly with the corresponding orientations of Cu. This
observation is in line with the earlier published result [38]. It can be noted further that the oxides
have low angle boundaries with the (110) Cu matrix (figure 23a) and high angle boundaries with
