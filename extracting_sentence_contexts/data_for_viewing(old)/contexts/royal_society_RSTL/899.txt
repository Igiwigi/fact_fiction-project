that they may be contemplated either as differential coeffi-
cients, as the limiting equations of NEwTov, or as the nume-
rical coefficients of the transformed equation in R + x. This
last elementary view will suffice for determining them," in
most of the cases to which the popular solutions are adequate ;
viz. in finite equations where R, an unambiguous limiting
value of z, is readily to, be conjectured. When perplexity
arises in consequence of some roots being imaginary, or dif-
fering by small quantities, the second notation must be called
in aid. "The first, in general, when oz is irrational or trans-
cendental.

21. The fact just stated, namely, that our theorem-con-
tains within itself the requisite conditions for investigating the
limits, or presumptive impossibility, of the roots, demonstrates
its sufficiency for effecting the developement of the 'real
roots, independently of any previous knowledge of R. For this
purpose, we might assumeR =0;7, 7, &c. = 1 or, 1 &c. and
adopt, as most suitable to these conditions, the algorithm of
Theorem 1I, until we had arrived at R*, an unambiguous
limiting value of z. But since these initiatory researches
