We have recalculated this matrix using the (n|n—2, 2) fractional parentage coefficients,
using formulae given below, and the values are given in table 6, which differs only in the
overall sign of certain elements from Racah’s table. As Racah points out, the elements can
be factorized into a purely orbital and purely charge-spin component, and it is possible to
choose these components so that they depend only on the representation symbols of the

appropriate special unitary groups; they are further invariant with respect to a change to
the contragredient representation with the possible exception of a change of sign when one
starred state of a self-contragredient representation is involved. In going from corresponding
states of the p" configuration to those of the p!?-” configuration, which belong to contra-
gredient representations, there is, in fact, with the Jahn & van Wieringen standard
(amended) phases only one matrix element which changes sign; this is the element

(p*[211] (210) (10) 38P | X | p*[31] (101) (21) SP)
(p®[332] (012) (01) 3P| X | p§[431] (101) (42) SBP)

All other matrix elements are the same for corresponding states of the p” and /'*~" con-
figurations.

The matrix elements of V were derived in the following manner (following Hope 1950).
We may write the wave functions for the nuclear /" configuration in the form
