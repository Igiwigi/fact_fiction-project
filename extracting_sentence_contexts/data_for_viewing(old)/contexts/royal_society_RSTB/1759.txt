The “ quadrate Kaloxylon” shown in O.N. 1635 is probably of the same nature.

This species of Heterangium (from the coal-measures of Halifax) was
described in 1887, when a full account of its general structure was given.*
specimens are few, but are remarkable for the astonishing perfection with which
anatomical details are preserved. We are enabled to add some information on
minute structure to the facts previously brought forward.

The stem in its general organization and dimensions resembles that of H. Grievii,
We do not propose in this case to give a detailed description of the whole structure,
which is unnecessary in view of what has already been done, but merely to state in
order the fresh points which our renewed examination of the specimens has brought
to light.

The first point to which we desire to call attention is the great distinctness of the
primary xylem-strands at the periphery of the central mass of wood. They at once
strike the observer as definite bundlest (see Plate 28, fig: 32) and can easily be
counted. Thus in one of the larger stems{ they number 20, and in a smaller
specimen they number 16. The structure of each of these strands is perfectly
