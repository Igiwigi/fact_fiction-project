In particular, the streamlines are confined into the level sets of B. The stationary Euler equations with the Bernoulli formulation are

div X=0. In the analytic setting, Arnold noted the following fact about solutions to these equations. Let
(M,g) be an analytic Riemannian manifold and let X be an analytic solution of the equations. If B is constant and X is non-vanishing, the vorticity is proportional to X everywhere, that is
curl X = fX for some analytic function f.
