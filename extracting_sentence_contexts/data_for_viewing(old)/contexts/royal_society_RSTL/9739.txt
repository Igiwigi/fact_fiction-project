The importance of the phenomenon is much greater than at firsb sight would appear.
In the first place, it affords direct evidence that there is negative discharge from the
inside of the tube close to the finger, for these molecular streams only occur as all
accompaniment of negative discharge. This alone is a result of great value. The:
phenomena of positive relief which in the previous paper were attributed to negative
discharge could only be identified with the phenomena” characteristic of negative
terminals by a long and intricate process, and even after this identification had been.
satisfactorily made it was often difficult to trace the resemblance between the two 8ets
of phenomena 80 as fully to realise their identity. But here we have no such difficulty.
The indication cannot be mistaken ; and we are enabled to affirm just as certainly that
there is discharge from the side of the tube, and that 8nch discharge is of negative
electricity, as if we could test the electricity actually coming from it. And again, the'
fact that the same indication of negative discharge is obtainable from all parts of the
tube (except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of the negative terminal) is direct.
evidence that the discharge passes throughout the tube in the form of positive.
electricity, since the response is throughout in the form of negative discharge.

: lis importance of these considerations is greatly enhanced by the fact that this relief-

- that when the air-spark is in the positive the discharge is carried in these tubes by
© bursts of positive electricity, which pass throughout the whole length of the tube Jjust
