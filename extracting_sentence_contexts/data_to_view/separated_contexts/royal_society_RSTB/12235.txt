However, these

evoked responses to simple auditory tones and evoked happened not across wake and sleep states, but rather in anaes-

responses to more complex natural auditory stimuli. First, natu- thetized states with and without amphetamine to simulate

ral sounds, tones and spontaneous events were initially shown wake and sleep, respectively. The authors first recorded a

to evoke events with similar spikingâ€”including, in fact, timing- pre-sleep-like non-amphetamine anesthetized state with base-

based sequences. Later the authors used time bin-based firing line sequences displayed. In the same session, they then

rate vectors of their recorded populations to explore the recorded an amphetamine-based wake-like state during

multi-neuronal firing rate space occupied by tones, natural which somatosensory stimuli were given that induced different

stimuli and spontaneous activity (rate of each neuron rep- firing sequences which differed somewhat from that in the pre-

resented by a dimension in multi-dimensional space).
