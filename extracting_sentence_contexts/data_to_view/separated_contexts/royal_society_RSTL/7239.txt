It may be noticed also, that in the Strongylt, Ozyurides, and
Eany free Nematoids in which this excretory apparatus exists in the more undeveloped
Gndition of a yentral gland, its eliminatory function appears to be supplemented by the
fesence of almost similar glandular structures in connexion with the anus and vagina. S With regard to the integumental pores, they seem also to countenance the belief that

e deep integumental layer is to a certain extent an excretory organ, and I am in-
aq to look upon them as a series of excretory channels in connexion with this struc-
fre, having a 8ort of distant analogy therefore with sudorific ducts. That such is their
nature is to a certain extent countenanced by the fact of their extreme abundance in the
Frichocephali and Trichosomata, in which no ventral gland or other modification of this
excretory apparatus is to be met with; 80 that the function of these seems to be per-
formed by the cellular bands and related integumental pores 80 universally met with in
the animals of this group. Amongst the free Nematoids, too, the very species in which

these integumental channels are met with in the most marked abundance, such as Dory-
laimus stagnalis and Leptosomatum figuratum, are also those in which there is to be
found no trace either of ventral, anal, or vaginal glands. Amongst the free Nematoids we might expect to meet with some evidence of the per-
formance of the atrating portion of the respiratory proces, and I think this may be
