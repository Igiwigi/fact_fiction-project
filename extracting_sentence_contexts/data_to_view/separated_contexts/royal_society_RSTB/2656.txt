The reptiles and batrachians of the South Indian and Ceylonese mountains differ
so widely from those of the Himalayas and of the ranges in the east of the Bay of
Bengal, that it is impossible to regard them as belonging to the same subregional
fauna : not a single genus, so far as I am aware, can be regarded as belonging to a
special mountain type. It is perfectly true that there are on the higher ranges of Southern India forms of
plants and animals such as Rhododendron arboreum and Mustela flavigula, which are
not found in other parts of the Indian Peninsula, but which occur on the Himalayas
and on some of the ranges east of the Bay of Bengal. A similar fact, the reappear-
ance of northern forms on southern mountain tops, is a familiar feature throughout
the Northern hemisphere, and has generally been attributed to the migration of such
forms southward during the Glacial epoch. I think the appearance of Himalayan
vertebrates on the Nilgiris and other South Indian ranges may be thus accounted
for, but the occurrence of forest forms in these ranges, and the absence of the same
in the greater part of India proper, is largely due to the destruction of forest by man
and domestic animals in tracts suitable for agriculture. So far as I can see, the
number of genera of birds and mammals peculiar to the Himalayas and to the hills
of Southern India and of Burma, is insufficient to entitle these areas to separation as
a distinct subregion, and the other classes of vertebrata do not support the theory.
