The vertebree are now well chondrified, and in all cases the neuro- and centro-chon-
drites have united so as to form complete cartilaginous vertebrae. The neural arches are,
however, incomplete dorsad throughout the whole column, the neuroids not having yet
united above the spinal cord. This is particularly well marked in the sacral (fig. 193)
and caudal regions, in which the whole dorsai surface of the cord is covered only by
membrane. In the sacral region, moreover, the right and left moieties of the centrum
do not quite meet below the notochord (fig. 193), so that the body presents a narrow
membranous interval in the middle ventral line.

The pleurochondrites of the cervical vertebrae or cartilaginous cervical ribs (fig. 191,
pl.chn.) have evidently only recently chondrified, and form mere nodules united by
membrane with the di- and par-apophyses. The thoracic ribs (fig. 192) are well
chondrified, but there is no trace of sacral ribs (fig. 193), and in fact the whole of
the post-thoracic vertebrae appear to be devoid both of lateral out growths and of
pleuro-chondrites.

The vertebre generally are very much higher in proportion to their breadth than in

later stages, the centra being nearly circular in section and the transverse processes

short (compare fig. 191 with fig. 181, and fig. 192 with fig. 184).

Stages E and F (Plate 15, figs. 194-197).

In both these stages the vertebral column was cut into sagittal sections; there is
