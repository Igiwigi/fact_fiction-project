632 MR. B. STEWART ON THE NATURE OF THE FORCES

zontal component of the earth's magnetism bears always a nearly invariable proportion
to its effect upon the vertical component of the same. In this cage it is clear that two
or more disturbing forces superimposed would, as far as regards the horizontal and vertical-
force changes, behave almost in the same manner as a pure elementary disturbance, This
als explains why it is almost impossible to find a peak in the one component of the force
corresponding to a hollow in the other.

24. This curious fact may likewise be stated in the following language ;â€”

Whatever be the nature of the disturbing force at work, its resolved portion, which acts in
the plane of the magnetic meridian at Kew, is always in nearly the ame line.

25. It is very easy to find the direction of this line.

A disturbance of the horizontal force, as it appears in the curve, is, we have seen, very
nearly double that of the vertical force. Now an inch in the ordinate of the horizontal-
force curve denotes a change amounting to nearly *010 of the whole force, while for the
yertical-force curve it represents a change of :0025 of the whole ; and increasing ordinates
denote decreasing force for both elements. Also the absolute value of the horizontal
force is 3:8, while that of the vertical force is 9:6.
