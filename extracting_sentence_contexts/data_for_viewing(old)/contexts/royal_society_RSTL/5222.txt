HAVING submitted the hourly observations of the magnetic declination made at
the St. Helena and the Cape of Good Hope Observatories to a course of examination
similar to that undertaken by Colonel Sapixs for Toronto and Hobarton, and
published by him in the Philosophical Transactions, Part I. for 1851, and Part I. for
1852, also in Vol. II. Magnetical and Meteorological Observations at Hobarton, and
Vol. IH. Magnetical and Meteorological Observations at Toronto (now in the press),
with the object of investigating some of the laws which govern the occurrence of the
larger magnetic disturbances, I have found that at these two tations, as well as at
the two others, the evidence is complete of the existence of laws of a periodical
character: the facts appear to be important materials towards elucidating the general
laws of disturbances, and I therefore venture to communicate them to the Royal
Society.

The observations which have been examined are comprised between September
1842 and September 1847 at St. Helena, and between July 1841 and July 1846 at
the Cape of Good Hope; these periods include all the hourly observations that could
be made available for discussion.

The obseryations were made simultaneously at all the magnetic stations, viz. at
the commencement of each Gittingen hour ; we have, therefore, the best opportunity
of judging of the degree in which the disturbances may be referred to one general
cause, while by arranging them with regard to local time, the means are afforded of
