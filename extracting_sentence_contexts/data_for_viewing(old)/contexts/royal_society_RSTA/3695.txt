Finally, we use estimate (3.11) together with the fact that 0, 2 1 andr ~ 1 inside [2ry + 19)/3, (tw +

4. Proof of proposition 3.1

We begin by showing that F), achieves its minimum. Indeed, replacing the membrane term in (2.6)
by its positive part—that is, replacing the first term under the integral by (vu! + 3(r/R -w Py
makes the problem convex. This modified problem achieves its minimum by the direct method
of the calculus of variations. We claim that its minimizer (v,,7;,) also minimizes the original
functional F;,. This follows from the fact that for (vj, @;,) the expression v;, + (r/R - w),)? must
be non-negative almost everywhere (as otherwise one can easily modify (v,,i@,) to obtain a
