That we continue to use
imaging studies continue to show (Wandell et al. 2005), the early nomenclature reflects in part the inadequacy,
the approach remains a highly successful one. Indeed, because of limited spatial resolution, of imaging
to the cytoarchitectonic and myeloarchitectonic maps methods to subdivide the cortex in the way that
one can now add a new kind of map based on time, the anatomical and physiological studies can. It reflects
chronoarchitectonic map, which also shows many more in part, too, an obvious, although possibly unwelcome,
subdivisions than the early cartographers could have fact: that most practitioners of imaging methods today
imagined (Bartels & Zeki 2005). Moreover, new are impatient with anatomical and microscopic studies
methods are being developed to localize functions in and have therefore been reluctant to supplement their

imaging studies with histological ones. This should not
be taken as criticism.
