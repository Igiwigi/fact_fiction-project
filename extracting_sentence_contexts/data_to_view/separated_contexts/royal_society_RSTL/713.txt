The proportions of the constituent parts of this substance I
have not as yet ascertained-; but from the manner by which it
is produced, carbowis evidently the base of it, and is the pre-
dominating essential ingredient. From $ II. experiment F. it also appears, that the other
component parts are oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen ; for
when the artificial tanning substance was distilled, ammonia and
carbonic acid were obtained, exclusive of a very small portion
of a yellow liquor, which stained the upper part of the retort,
and which, from its tenacity and insolubility in water and
alcohol, appeared to be of an oily nature. As I had taken every precaution respecting the charcoal
which had been employed, I was at first induced to consider
the above facts as almost positively demonstrative of the pre-
sence of hydrogen in charcoal, but upon farther reftexion, and
upon weighing some of the circumstances which attend the

formation of the artificial tanning substance, I ï¬†till feel on this
point very considerable doubt ; for I have' constantly observed;
that diluted nitric acid, acts upon charcoal more effectually, in
the formation of the tanning substance, than when it is em-
ployed in a concentrated state; and it appears therefore very
probable, that hydrogen may have beew afforded by a' portion
of water decomposed during the process. For, admitting that
the 'new compound (formed by-the' action of - nitric acid
upon charcoal ) may possess a certain degree of affinity for
hydrogen, this being exerted simultaneously -with the affi-
nity for oxygen possessed by nitrous gas, 'may (especially
when the last is in a nascent state/) effect 'a decomposition'of a
portion of water, the hydrogen'of which-would therefore enter
into the composition of the tanning substance, whilst theoxygen
would supply the place of part of that: which had been taken
from the nitric acid.
