Now in these particulars the Medus present a striking resemblance to certain
other families of Zoophytes. These are the Hydroid and Sertularian Polypes, the Phy-
s8ophoridz and Diphydz, with all of which the same three propositions hold good®.

57. But in order to demonstrate that a real affinity exists among different classes
of animals, it is not sufficient merely to point out that certain similarities and analo-
gies exist among them ; it must be shown that they are constructed upon the same
anatomical type, that, in fact, their organs are homologous. Now the organs of two animals or families of animals are homologous when their
stracture is identical, or when the differences between them may be acconnted for by
the simple laws of growth. When the organs differ considerably, their homology
may be determined in two ways, either—1, by tracing back the course of develop-
ment of the two until we arrive by similar stages at the same point ; or, 2, by inter-
polating between the two a series of forms derived from other animals allied to both,

the difference between each term of the series being such only as can be accounted
for by the laws of growth.
