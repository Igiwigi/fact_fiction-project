In the following table the relative values are given in
parallel columns.

Data.—Head of water = 3 metres; length of stems = 25 centims. ‘Temperature,
averaged 18° C.

On studying the first two columns of ratios (columns 3 and 5) it can be seen that
in both cases extremely great divergence is shown, and if we except the apple, the rate
of flow is, if anything, more nearly proportional to the radius than to its square. This
is possibly owing to the fact that the rate of flow in the larger vessels is not so
much more active than in the smaller ones, as might be expected from purely physical
considerations, there being a certain tendency to level up the flow by lateral
diffusion, the slower streams being accelerated and the rapid ones retarded. However
this may be, the ratios between the squares of the average radii of the vessels and
