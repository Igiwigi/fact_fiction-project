Table 2. Description of definition of pre-industrial, present-day, 1.5°C-climate and 2°C-climate conditions in ESR-CMIP5 and
HAPPI analyses. ESR-CMIPS (based on [5] and [8]) HAPPI [9]

pre-industrial conditions 1861-1880 1861-1880 (used for definition of global warming
references, no simulations)

present-day conditions AT glob = 1°C in CMIPS simulations 2006-2015 (observed SSTs, sea ice,

for twenty-first century GHG and land use)
1.5°C-climate AT gop = 1.5°C in CMIP5 simulations simulations driven with SST and sea ice conditions
for twenty-first century consistent with ATjoy = 1.5°C in CMIPS RCP2.6
simulations; land use from the RCP 2.6 scenario
2°C-climate AT glob = 2°C in CMIPS simulations simulations driven with SST and sea ice conditions
for twenty-first century consistent with ATioy = 2°C in CMIPS RCP2.6
and RCP4.5 simulations; land use from the RCP2.6
scenario

Because of its ease of interpretation, and the fact that the analyses can be performed
based on already existing simulations, the ESR approach has been used in several publications
assessing changes in regional climate extremes at 1.5°C versus 2°C, and higher levels of global
warming [5,7]. In the present article, we use the CMIP5-based ESR analyses data processed in Wartenburger
et al. [8], based on slightly modified analyses compared to Seneviratne et al. [5] (see [8] for more
details and links to the data). The ESR-CMIP5 estimates are based on simulations from 26 Earth
system models (ESMs) with interactive ocean including up to 10 ensembles per model.
