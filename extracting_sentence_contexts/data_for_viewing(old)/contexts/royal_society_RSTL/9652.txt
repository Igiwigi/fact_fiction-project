of this organ at a 8mall cost of nervous energy. How far the rhythm of the nectocalyx is to be attributed
to the resistance mechanism of the ganglia, and how far to the alternate exhaustion and recoyery of the
contractile tissues, T think it is impossible to determine, secing that it is impossible exactly to imitate the
natnral ganglionic stimulation by artificial means. But ib is, 1 think, of importance to have ascertained
at least this mnch : that in Sarsia the tonus of one organ and the rhythm of another, which apparently
both recoived their stimulation from the same ganglia, must at any rate in part be attributed to a differ-
ential irritability of these organs as distinguished from their differential stimulation.

are to a large extent novel, I have thought it desirable to insist on their theoretical
importance rather than on that of facts which are better known, and which serve to
uphold existing views respecting the action of ganglia. Nevertheless, even within the
limits of the Medusz, I have found only too much reason for concluding that the full
explanation of natural rhythm must be more complex than that which I believe to
apply to artificial rhythr. In particular I may allude to the case of Sarsia. The
artificial rhythm which may be produced in the paralyzed nectocalyx of this organism
by means of a constant stimulation is of a widely different character from that which
occurs in the unmutilated and healthy animal. The comparatively feeble, fluttering,
and ineffectual sequence of contraction and relaxation in the former case contrast
strongly with the powerful, determined, and pumping-like movement in the latter
cage, Indeed, striking and 8uggestive as are the phenomena of artificial rhythm in
Sarsia, none but the most prejudiced of observers could fail to perceive that it is but
a gorry substitute for the natural rhythm of vigorous specimens. In feeble specimens,
