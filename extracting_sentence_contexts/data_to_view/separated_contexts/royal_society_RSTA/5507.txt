The intensity of the two-dimensional band in
the case of the Fe/N/SD (4:10:10) sample was extremely high while the band was the broadest
in the case of the Fe/N/SD (2:10:10) sample. Thus, sample Fe/N/SD (2:10:10) contained
the smallest amount of graphite. In fact, from the BET surface areas shown in the electronic
supplementary material, figure S2, it was confirmed that sample Fe/N/SD (2:10:10) had a
specific surface area twice as large as that of sample Fe/N/SD (1:10:10). This probably resulted
in poor growth of the graphite crystals, which, in turn, increased the ORR activity. Thus, based
on the above-discussed results, it can be concluded that the growth of the graphite crystals
suppressed the ORR activity.
