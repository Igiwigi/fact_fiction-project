4. Critical evaluation of the theorems

The singularity theorems are often quoted as one of the greatest theoretical accomplishments
in mathematical physics. They have tremendous physical consequences and cast serious doubts
on the suitability of GR in very extreme situations. Nevertheless, the singularity theorems are
often misquoted, and there are some ‘myths’ and folklore about them that must be dispelled. As
with other subtle matters, the devil is in the detail. In what follows I provide selected lists of ideas
concerning what the theorems say—and do not say.

(a) (Mis)interpretation of Penrose’s theorem

Sometimes the Penrose theorem is interpreted as definite proof that black holes form in
gravitational collapse. This is incorrect and the actual fact is much more subtle. The assumption
of the existence of a trapped sphere does not state anything about the formation of black
holes, rather it uncovers (some of) what happens inside black holes once they are formed!
This follows from a theorem [14,29] stating that, in asymptotically flat space-times, no closed
trapped surface can be seen from infinity, in other words, the trapped spheres are enclosed
beyond the event horizon of the black hole, and thus they are already inside black holes already
formed.

Therefore, Penrose’s theorem informs us of what happens beyond the event horizon of black
holes. It is a result about the interior of black holes telling us that, if they form, inside them there
will probably be closed trapped surfaces and, therefore, incompleteness of the space-time will
follow (classically and under certain conditions). This is not a minor thing, for hitherto this is one
of the few solid informations we have been able to produce with some certainty about the interior
