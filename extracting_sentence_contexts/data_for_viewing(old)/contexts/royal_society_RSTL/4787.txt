I have as yet been unsuccessful in my attempts to determine the atomic weight of
rubianine. The little affinity which it has for bases is proved by the fact above men-

tioned, of its crystallizing unchanged out of its alkaline solutions. The baryta com-
pound, which is obtained by adding chloride of barium to its ammoniacal Solution,
is easily decomposed when it comes to be washed with pure water, the baryta being
dissolved by the water, a yellow residue of rubianine being left at last. It is not
capable of separating oxide of lead from acetic acid. In fact it nearly approaches
the character of a perfectly neutral body, a cireumstance which might be @ priori
foreseen from its containing more carbon and less oxygen than rubian itself, the pro-
perties of which are not far removed from those of an indifferent substance.

There are three formulze which all of them give for 100 parts, numbers not widely
differing from those found by experiment, viz. C,, H,; O,,, C,, H;y O;; and C,, Hy, O,,.
These formulz require for 100 parts of substance the following amount of consti-
tuents :â€”
