Instead of giving a complete account
following a chronological order or following a structure imposed by methods or systems, I tried to assign
classical and modern studies to topics of enduring relevance such that each collection of studies spans from
fundamentals to future prospects. With this completely subjective and necessarily incomplete selection,
which of course is nothing else than re-sorting a very lintited set of representative investigations, I want to
at least help motivating future applications of time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy in photochemistry. In fact,
I have another intention. When put together, such as here, these collections, hopefully, expose a common
pattern: ‘things are coming together’. X-ray free-electron lasers may be considered transformative tools
that give access to new observables which, when combined with established knowledge, can be used to bring
back together different aspects of the same problem.
