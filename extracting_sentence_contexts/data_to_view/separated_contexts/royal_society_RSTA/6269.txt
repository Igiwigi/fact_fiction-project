The result implies that the structure possesses an alternating strain
deformation ahead of the bridge crack front [36]. In all admissible regimes computed below, this
behaviour located at 7 < 0 is typical during the bridge fracture process. In fact, in the next sections,
we demonstrate that it is the behaviour of the structure within the bridge crack zone at 7 > 0 that
provides an upper speed limit for this failure regime. Additionally, the analytical model developed above assumes (0) = tc, which is the case for
all trajectories shown in figure 3. For 7 >1, the trajectories undergo oscillations.
