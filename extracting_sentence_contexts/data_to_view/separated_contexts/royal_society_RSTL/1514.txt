V. 1. Not only do the pupils move together, when both eyes
are in a healthy state, but the pupil of one eye affected with
gutta serena moves with the pupil of the other, as long as this

remains sound. These facts are generally, but in my opinion
erroneously, attributed to an immediate sympathy between
the pupils. For when the pupil of one eye becomes dilated
from the application of Belladonna, the pupil of the other, 50

the size of the pupil is dependant, not only on the impression
of light on the retina of its own eye, but on that also which is
made on the retina” of the other, and that the moving of the
two together, which for the most part takes place, is only an
accidental consequence of the fact which I have mentioned.
