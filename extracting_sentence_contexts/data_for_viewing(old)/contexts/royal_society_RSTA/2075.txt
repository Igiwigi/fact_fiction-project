at the spatial infinities sufficiently rapidly. On the other hand, a weak invariant can be free
from boundary conditions as long as its expectation value is finite and equation (2.3) holds.
Accordingly, there exist large degrees of freedom in its choice. This is certainly an advantageous

+ Lil, t)] =0, (2.2)


point since it implies that a wide class of quantities satisfying equation (2.2) can be chosen as a
weak invariant, depending on physical interest. However, as seen in the subsequent discussion,
a weak invariant is subject to the final condition, not the initial condition.

Although the first moment of the weak invariant satisfies equation (2.3), the higher moments
do not, in general. In fact, the variance (AJ)? = (J?) â€” Uy? monotonically increases as follows:

d(Aj)?

where J =0J (x, f)/@x.

Because of its irreversible nature and the structure of the first-order time derivative, it is non-
trivial to develop the action principle for the Fokker-Planck equation. A quantum mechanical
analogue of this issue has been studied in [26,27]. There, an auxiliary field A has been introduced
for the extension of the space of variables, by which the action can be constructed. In the present
