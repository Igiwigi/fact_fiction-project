diameter, its heat, increased in very combustible mixtures, 80
as to explode them. The same wire in less combustible mix-
tures only continued bright red, or dull red, according to the
nature of the mixture.

In mixtures not explosive by flame within certain limits,
these curious phenomena. took place whether the air or the
inflammable gas was in excess.

The same circumstance occurred with certain inflammable
vapours. I have tried those of ether, alcohol, oil of turpentine
and naphtha. There cannot be a better mode of illustrating
the fact, than by an experiment on the vapour of ether or of
alcohol, which any person may make in a minute. Let a
drop of ether be thrown into a cold glass, or a drop of alcohol
into a warm one. Let a few coils of wire. of platinum of the
2.07 -; of an inch be heated at a hot poker or a candle, and
let it be brought into the glass;- it will in some part of the
glass become glowing, almost white hot, and will continue
$0 as long as asufficient quantity of vapour and of air remain
in.the glass.

When the experiment on the slow combustion of ether is
made in the dark, a pale phosphorescent light is perceived
above the wire, which of course is most distinct when the wire
