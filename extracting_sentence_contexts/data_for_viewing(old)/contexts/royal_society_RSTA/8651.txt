surroundings, V is the velocity of the air-current, and d the diameter of the wire.
This equation is theoretically applicable whenever
Vd < 0-0187, a condition which is amply fulfilled in the
present case with d = 0-0006 cm. and V not greater
than 6 cms. per second. We have not, however, been able
to adapt this equation in any way which leads to useful
results in the case of the Hot-Wire Microphone. It may
be remarked that both the diameter of the wire and the
magnitude of the air-currents with which we are concerned
are considerably smaller than those used in the experi-
ments of Kine, or of other investigators to whose work
reference will be found in Kineâ€™s paper. In view of this
fact, and of the rather special form of the grid and its
mounting, it was thought desirable to determine experi-
mentally the relation between R and U for such small
values of U as are likely to be required to account for
the behaviour of the grid under the influence of alter-
nating air-currents.

The arrangement of the apparatus used in the experi-
ments is shown diagrammatically in fig. 9. A micro-
phone grid is mounted in the holder at A. The interior
of the small brass container (B), carrying the microphone
and holder communicated by means of the short tube (C)
with the reservoir (D), which was partly filled with water.
