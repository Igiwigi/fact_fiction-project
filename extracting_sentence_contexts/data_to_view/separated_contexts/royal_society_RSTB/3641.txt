The eye movements alone differ, and these
differences are intimately associated with the increasing magnitude and complexity of
development of the cerebrum in the vertebrate phylum. The typical results of lesions
of the membranous labyrinth, excepting nystagmus, are very largely unaffected by
the presence or absence of the phylogenetically newer pathways. The inference from these facts appears-to be that in the vestibular system and its
central connections we have a phylogenetically primitive nervous mechanism which
has persisted throughout the vertebrate phylum—or, at least, in all orders above and
including the fishes—relatively unaffected, either morphologically or functionally, by
the profound and even revolutionary changes occurring in the general somatic motor
system. Itseems probable, also, that the lateral lobes of the cerebellum are associated
far more closely with the phylogenetically newer somatic motor system than with the
primitive motor system. We believe that while this phylogenetic primitive vestibular
mechanism persists, it has acquired in the higher vertebrates an ever increasing
association with newer pathways.
