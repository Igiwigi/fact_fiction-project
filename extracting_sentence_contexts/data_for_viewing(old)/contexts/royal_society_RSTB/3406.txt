The same result is apparent for Cienfuegos, the chief town of Santa Clara province,
although the province itself is remarkable for a high M. birth-rate, and it may here be
noted that an identical variation in the results for Cienfuegos and its province is
manifest in the returns for coloured people, indicating that some special factor is
exercising marked influence in the town of Cienfuegos.

Generally speaking, it is clear that the F. birth-rate is distinctly higher in towns
than in provinces, while the F. death-rate is higher in provinces than in the towns.
The rise in the proportion of F. births in towns is shown for both legitimate and
illegitimate children (Matanzas alone excepted), and is very marked in both,

Colowred.â€”The numbers dealt with for this race are so much fewer than for whites,
the returns cannot be utilised for detailed comparison. There is one pronounced fact
however, namely that, as was the case for whites, the proportion of coloured F. born
in towns is very considerably higher than is experienced in the provinces, and this is
true for both legitimate and illegitimate births, as a rule. Again, Matanzas is an
exception, and here also Pinar has a still more marked increase of M. among
illegitimate births, but the total for towns shows a much increased output of F. for both
