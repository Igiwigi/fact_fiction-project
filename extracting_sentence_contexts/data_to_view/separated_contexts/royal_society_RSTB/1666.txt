Hence the ventilation of the heart-wood is difficult. Aisculus and Salix both have small numerous vessels and much fibre, but no
tracheids and very little wood-parenchyma. Whereas Salix forms a distinct heart-
wood, that of Asculus is very little, if at all, different from the sap-wood, and no
doubt the much freer growth of the hyphe in the “heart-wood” of dsculus is
correlated with this fact. At the same time the matter deserves further examination. Harte in his work, ‘ Die Zersetzungserscheinungen des Holzes’ (p. 129), gives
an account of the destruction of oak-wood by S. hirsutum, but his description refers
to that wood only, and to the rot as it occurs in the forest; no question of pure
cultures is touched by him.
