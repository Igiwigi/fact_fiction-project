Kraichnan [43] had already noted the possibility
that the [+/+ +] and [—/ — —] modal subsets could lead to (partial) inverse energy cascades, but
he also remarked that the other remaining nonlinear interactions would swamp such effects. Moreover, it is shown in [27] that these several fluxes are constant separately in the inertial
range. In fact, the presence of several invariants, beyond global energy and helicity, has also been
discussed by a number of authors. For example, the case of helical symmetry, as a generalization
of axial symmetry (the axis being now an helix) is discussed in [23]. Such flows are, again, quasi
two-dimensional; they have an infinite number of invariants, like for the two-dimensional Euler
equations, and are proven as well to be integrable [74].
