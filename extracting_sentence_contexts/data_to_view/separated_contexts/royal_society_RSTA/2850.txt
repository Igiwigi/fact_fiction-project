The response of material points lying outside of the FPZ is governed by the applicable o — «
behaviour of the bulk material. Only if the FPZ is very small with regard to the specimen size is
the one-parameter Griffith LEFM theory applicable. Assuming that the size (Agp,) of the fictitious
crack is not negligible, knowledge of the closure stress function Ofpz(w) is essential. An adequate
VFCM for sea ice thus requires the SSC: o, w_, We and G, (see figure 3). For any sea ice fracture test, the SSC as well as the viscoelastic characterization of the sea
ice is not known.
