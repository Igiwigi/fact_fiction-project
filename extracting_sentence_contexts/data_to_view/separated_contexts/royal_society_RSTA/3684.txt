It is possible
that, even in the case of the most brittle solids known, this condition may cease to
hold before rupture occurs, although the stress-strain relation may continue to be
linear, Nevertheless, the calculated values of even the breaking strains in a material
like cast iron, for instance, are so small as to render this unlikely. For a ductile metal, such as mild steel, the elastic results only tell you where the
material will begin to take permanent set. In the case of stone or cement, however, to which the present results would be
applied, there seems to be no definite yield-point or elastic limit, the material being,
in fact, only imperfectly elastic throughout. Still, we may consider that the results

of elastie theory give in such a case an indication of the state of stress when the
specimen breaks.
