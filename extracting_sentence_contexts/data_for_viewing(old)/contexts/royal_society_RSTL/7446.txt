increased in frequency, it was found that if artificial respiration was vigorously per-
d at regular intervals, a tracing could be obtained of the character shown in
late XXV. fig. 1, in which it is seen that each injection of air is accompanied by a
nltaneons but very slight elevation of the arterial lever, which, however, was not
associated with acceleration of the heart's contractions: 'DThis experiment was repeated
-under similar conditions on the 8th of June, when a corresponding but not s0 marked
\mechanical effect was observed. 'Ten minutes afterwards both pneumogastrics were
divided in the neck. 'The arterial pressure at once rose to 9 inches, and the pulse attained
'& frequency of 240 per minute. The mercurial column remained at the same height for
Sveral minutes, during which the tracing (Plate XXV. fig. 2) was taken, Here, as in
. 1, it is seen that the diminution of arterial pressure produced by each inflation is
mot accompanied with any acceleration of the heart's contractions*.
5 The facts related in the preceding paragraphs afford no answer to the question whether
fe phenomena observed are due to the direct influence of a&rated blood on the heart
Heelf, or to its indirect influence through the neryous centres over the rhythmical move-
Bents of the heart. Their principal significance in relation to the present inquiry consists ;
A their affording ground for the inference that, whereas the effects of the thoracic
Hovements in ordinary inspiration are almost immediate, a considerable time is required
Sr the production of those which. are due to chemical changes in the circulating blood.
