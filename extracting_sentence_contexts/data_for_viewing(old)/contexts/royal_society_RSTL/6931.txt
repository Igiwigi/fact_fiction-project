3 7. We may without loss of generality attend only to the last-mentioned case. To

2 show how this is, suppose for a moment that the two lines do not either of them meet

== the curve; the scroll is then of the order 212. Call the point in which each line meets

= the plane of the curve the foot of this line, then the line joining the two feet meets the

Z.curve in m points; and it is in respect of each of these .points a generating line of the

2 8croll; that is, it is an m-tuple generating line: the section of the scroll by the plane of

3 the curve m2 is in fact this line counting m times, and the curye m; m+m=2m, the

Sorder of the scroll. And in like manner the section by any plane through the m-tuple
S line is this line counting m times, and a curye of the order m not meeting either of the

Sdirectrix lines. But the section by any other plane is a curve of the order 27 meeting

E each of the directrix lines in a point which is an m-tuple point of the section (each direc-

& trix line is in fact an m-tuple line of the scroll) ; and by considering, in place of the par-

6 ticular section m, this general section, we have the scroll of the order 217 in the form
