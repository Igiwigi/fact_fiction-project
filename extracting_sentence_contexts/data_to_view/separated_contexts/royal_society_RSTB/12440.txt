Then we reviewed the network architecture of the
brain, which supports that learning. We discussed similarities
and differences in constraints on network architectures in
these two systems. As is clear from the fact that the exposition
is peppered with questions, much work is still needed in empiri-
cal science and in philosophy separately. But perhaps the most
exciting prospects lie in interdigitating these two perspectives
to guide the field towards a united understanding of the individ-
ual and collective mind and its relation to individual and
collective knowledge. Data accessibility.
