Upon esterification using CO} as an activator, the carboxylate is converted into methy] ester with
complete recycling of coz". This reaction enables the synthesis of dimethylfurandicarboxylate
(dm FDCH) from furfural, a cheap, biomass-derived feedstock. But dm FDCA is a high-value
monomer for large-scale polymer syntheses.

(i) Use of algae to convert C02, water and sunlight to ethanol

Among the comments made by German Nobel Prize winner, Hartmut Michel [35], concerning the
production of biofuels, was the specific reference to the fact that biofuels constitute an extremely
inefficient use of land. As a consequence of this indisputable fact, many investigators have turned
their attention to the use of algae as a means of generating ethanol (and also of converting biomass
to hydrocarbons). A prime merit of doing so is the use of seawater (and seashores), rather than
arable land that is required to grow crops for foodstuffs.

lam grateful to Prof. R. R. Chance (2015, personal communication to J.M.T.) for providing me
with an opposite illustration (figure 4) of how CO) (from an industrial site in Florida) may be
combined in sunlight with H2O to yield ethanol:

2CO, + 3E)0  CoHsOH + 30.

The company of which Prof. Chance is a leading member, Algenol biofuels, has used ‘enhanced’
cyanobacteria, having screened 2300 strains of algae collected globally as candidates for
