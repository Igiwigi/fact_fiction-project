from the primitive knot, a primitive streak traversing an area of thickened ectoderm,
and a proliferating mesodermal sheet, were also present.

The surface examination of the blastoderm of both of these specimens was carried
out prior to the sectioning of either, and both were examined at a time when, as
already stated, we had no reason to expect special differentiation in a region distinct,
and even comparatively remote, from the quite obvious gastrula-knot. We are
conscious that it may be assumed, on this ground, that our original examination of
the remainder of the blastoderm away from the primitive knot must have been
somewhat perfunctory. We cannot admit this to have been the case. In the
instances of the two specimens, belonging to this same stage, next to be described,
we had the full experience of specimens D and DD to guide us. They did not, in
fact, come into our hands until after the publication of our previous paper. Yet the
difficulties of examination of these specimens in toto, with due regard to their
adequate preservation for sectioning, were such that it was only with the greatest
difficulty that we were able, on surface examination, to detect in one of them (Y) the

* It is worthy of note that this extrusion had occurred actually through the blastoporic opening itself,
as the serial sections subsequently proved, and had been effected by an actual evagination, or extroversion,
of the wall of the gastrula-cavity or archenteron, by the underlying yolk. The blastoporic lips were
completely everted around the protruding mass of yolk-spheres. The yolk-mass is, indeed, seen in section
to be surrounded by a definite line, almost as if a delicate cuticular lining of the archenterie cavity, or
derived from the underlying yolk-entoderm, had been evaginated along with the mass of yolk and
remained stretched over it as an extremely attenuated limiting membrane.
