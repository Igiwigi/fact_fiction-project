is consistent in showing a progressive movement to the westward of the spaces in the
Southern Pacific, characterized by certain magnetic peculiarities, which in Hatuey's
view indicated the proximity and predominance of the weaker system of forces. It
is worthy of notice that the rate of progression, deduced from the changes of position
8hown at the several epochs, differs much less from a uniform rate than might have
been anticipated from the nature of the evidence we possess, even supposing the
actual rate to have been uniform in nature ; whilst the magnitude of the whole
change which appears to have taken place since the phenomenon became the snbject
of observation, in round numbers 50? of longitude in two centuries and a half, can
scarcely fail to fix the attention. These are facts which, when the true physical causes
of the magnetism of the globe shall occupy the earnest attention of philosophers, will
probably attain an importance which at present perhaps we scarcely sufficiently esti-
mate. But an endeavour to place distinctly before our minds facts of which the
explanation mnst be deemed an essential condition of a satisfactory solution of this
great problem, may not be without its use even at the present time. It may be also
useful to call the attention of navigators to the value which may hereafter attach to
determinations which may be made with instruments which are on board every ship,
and in constant employ for the ordinary purposes of navigation. The position of the
lines separating the spaces which have been the snbject of discussion, has the advan-
tage of being eyen more easily determined by observations on board ship than that
of any particular declination line; in crossing them, the declination, if previously
decreasing, will then begin to increase, and if previously increasing will begin to
decrease ; the determination is therefore independent of compass error, which is
a much more prevalent source of error than is generally supposed ; and if the ship's
course be steady for some days together, which in the latitudes in question is very
