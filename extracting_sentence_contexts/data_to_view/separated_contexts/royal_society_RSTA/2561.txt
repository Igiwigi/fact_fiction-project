Later such similar doubts,
sometimes in even more exaggerated forms, were expressed in connection with all other
prominent results, whose proofs relied on extensive computer calculations and/or case
analysis, including the remarkable Hales’ solution of Kepler’s problem.

e Doubts as to the reliability of particularly long and complicated proofs. The most
notorious and disputed example of such a highly complex proof is of course the
Classification of Finite Simple Groups, whose published proof amounts, according to
the most conservative estimate, to some 15000 pages. It is essentially the proof of the
theorem itself, that further relies on scores of subsidiary facts on finite groups and their
representations, algebraic groups, finite geometries, etc. However, the same question
naturally arises in connection with any sufficiently advanced result, whose formidable
proof takes a few hundred pages of tough, tightly knit and highly specialized arguments,
that in turn rely on oodles of previous difficult results. In these circumstances, ignorant popularisers and journalists started to speak about ‘loss of
certainty’ and even ‘death of proof’.
