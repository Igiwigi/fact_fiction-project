serving to show the connexion of the two deposits,â€”from the uniformity of its compo-
sition, and from the local nature and angularity of its debris. It presents precisely
those characters which would result from fine deposition from turbid waters, with the
occasional presence of a few angular fragments of the adjacent rocks. As the waters
subsided, this silt would be left in sheltered positions, would be added to from year to
year, until, as the river wore a deeper channel, the first-formed sediment would be left
permanently dry, only to be disturbed by meteorological agencies, which would from
time to time carry down portions of it into the river, now at a lower level, there to be
re-deposited at such lower levels.

Another proof of its limited extent and of its not having at any time filled the valleys.
is that in the lower levels, when it abuts against the hill-sides, it always Slopes up
towards the hill, following in fact nearly the present shape of the ground, and does
not form horizontal beds cut off and truncated in the way which s0 generally occurs
with the higher-level grayels, or when sedimentary strata have been excavated.

On this view of the subject the difficulty otherwise experienced in conceiving floods
of a magnitude 8nch that the waters would rise to the brim of these deep valleys, or in
supposing these valleys to be filled up with silt and afterwards re-excavated, is ayoided,
for it would reduce the rise to be accounted for to limits more compatible with our
experience of certain existing rivers. It is possible also that variations in the extent of
elevation of the land may even cause the difference often to appear greater than it is.

There is one seeming difficulty to this hypothesis, which must occur to every field
geologist: it is, the apparently distinct separation of the Loess and the underlying
