W. RUCKER ON THE

electrically measured thicknesses is to be accounted for by the gradual substitt
of one black tint for the other. The line, as we have said, is difficult to see, —
quite probable that the white flecks which draw attention to it are more nume
on some occasions than on others, or may sometimes be altogether absent, and
the fact that no line has been seen does not prove that the black film was not
divided into the two parts of different thicknesses. It will be observed, ho
that we have so framed the proposition under discussion that the possible agency
other causes in bringing about changes in the electrically measured thickness is
denied. Proposition VI.—Whereas the specific conductivity of black films formed of solut
containing about 3 per cent. of KNO, is approximately the same as that o
liquid in mass, the specific conductivity of similar films formed of solutions ¢
taining no KNOs, but consisting of a solution of oleate of soda or oleate
potash in water is very different from that of the liquid in mass.
