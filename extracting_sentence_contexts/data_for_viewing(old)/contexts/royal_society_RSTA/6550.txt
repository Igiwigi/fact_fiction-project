i, INTRODUCTION.

a
Py the year 1786 Ertanp Samuet Brine, Professor at the University of Lund in
Sweden, showed how by an extension of the method of TscHiRNHAUSEN it was
PPssible to deprive the general algebraical equation of the 5th degree of three of its
terms without solving an equation higher than the 3rd degree. By a well-understood,
‘However singular, academical fiction, this discovery was ascribed by him to one of his
‘own pupils, a certain SVEN Gustar SomMe.tus, and embodied in a thesis humbly
Submitted to himself for approval by that pupil, as a preliminary to his obtaining his
‘degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the University.* The process for effecting this
Seduction seems to have been overlooked or forgotten, and was subsequently re-dis-
govered many years later by Mr. Jerrarp. In a report contained in the ‘ Proceedings
of the British Association’ for 1836, Sir Wrnt1Am Haminron showed that Mr. JerrarD
Has mistaken in supposing that the method was adequate to taking away more than
three terms of the equation of the 5th degree, but supplemented this somewhat
‘dannecessary refutation of a result, known & priori to be impossible, by an extremely
Baluable discussion of a question raised by Mr. Jerrarp as to the number of
Sariables required in order that any system of equations of given degrees in those
Zriables shall admit of being satisfied without solving any equation of a degree
