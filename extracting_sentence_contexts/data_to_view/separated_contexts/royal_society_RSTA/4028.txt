As can be seen in figure 4a,b, the bubbles remain
in their typical elongated morphology. Owing to the cross-linking process, however, aggregation
of the bubbles frequently occurs (figure 4b). The fact that these bubbles no longer disappear lends
further credence to the notion that structural defects in the interfacial film could be the underlying
cause of this effect. Substantially cross-linking the surface layer can effectively ‘patch over’ any
structural defects locking the structure in place. An overall question remains: why are elongated air bubbles coated in BslA unstable while oil
in water emulsions are stable?
