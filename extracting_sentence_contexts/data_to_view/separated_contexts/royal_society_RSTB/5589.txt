In the spermatocyte the
nucleolus is large, and the cytoplasm granulated. The beginning of the reduction
division is accompanied by the disappearance of the nucleolus, and the chromatin
collects at one side of the nuclear membrane, the so-called “ synzesis.” (Plate 21,
fig. 15.)

(e) Secondary Spermatocytes.—The secondary spermatocytes are of short duration,
and are smaller than the primary spermatocytes. The maximum size of the testis is
reached, however, during this phase of maturation, partly owing to the fact that Phase i,
the growth of the spermatocytes, does not occur synchronously, the maximum number
being present at the time when the earliest formed have just undergone division, and
partly owing to the development of the interstitial elements of the testis. The chromo-
somes are most clearly seen at this stage, but they are always minute. The diploid
number is estimated to be 36 to 38, a number typical of most Teleost fish (BRESSLAU
and Harniscu, 1927).

(f) Spermatids.—The cysts enclosing the germ-cells during maturation are consider-
ably less distinct in Gasterosteus aculeatus than in Pygosteus pungitius, but a number of
definite cases showed that these cysts disappear at the time of formation of the spermato-
zoon.
