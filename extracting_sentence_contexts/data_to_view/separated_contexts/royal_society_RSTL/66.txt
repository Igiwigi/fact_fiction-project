So by the third Experiment, I found that the Quanti-
ty of Matter, that was us'd to.compoſe one Veſſel more
than the other, ſignify'd nothing to the Aſcent of the
Water, which ſeem'd wholly to.depend. on the largeneſs,
or the ſmallneſs of their Cavities, as to the height-it
would ariſe in them ; and as their Cavities are leiſen'd,
 # the Diſproportions of their inward Surfaces to their

Cavities are increas'd. And as the Magnet, when ſeparated into the premen-
tioned number of ſmallParts,will attra& more thanwhen' . E united in one, and is no more than ſeparating or work-

. ing the prementiond thick Body of Glaſs iato a number
&E of ſmall Tubes, that is multiplying the Surfaces ; the
Water then would ariſe in each of them figgly, as it
would when all in one Body, its Cavity being the fame
with theothers ; by which means, the quantity of Wa-
ter aſcending in them is augmented from the ſame
Quantity of Matter.- |

To conclude : "There ſeems to be ſuch an agreeable-
nels of the Qualities or Diſpolitions of one with the 0-
- ther, that I ſee no reaſon why the Facts proceed not
** from one and the ſame Cauſe; for as the inward Surfa-
ces of the Tubes are made ſmaller and ſmaller, ſo the
Power of their Attraction (as is viſible by the higher

Aſcent of the Water in them) is greater and greater,
and is, moſt demonſtrable by the Experiments of rhs
Plancs ; for their inward Ares being always the lame,
{q char as they are placed nearer and nearer to each other,
the Cavity or Space- between them becomes leſs and
le6, and conſequently the Diſproportions are increaſed,
whereby the Power of their Attraction is augmented. EXPERIMEN T Iv. This Experiment T take to be very Analogous to thoſe
lately made on_ the ſeeming ſpontaneous Aſcent of
Water between Glaſs, Marble, and Braſs Planes, as al-
{o with thoſe madein Capillary*Tubes ; ſince it ſeems to
proceed from the fame Principle, and ſubject to the ſame
Laws, as appears by matter of Fact ; which take as fol-
lows.
