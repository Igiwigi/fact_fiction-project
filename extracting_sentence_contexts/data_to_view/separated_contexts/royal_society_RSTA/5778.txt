In this paper, we follow this pathway: borrowing ideas from kinetic theory [30,31], we combine
a classical compartmental approach for fake-news dissemination inspired by epidemiology
[15,16] with a kinetic description of the effects of competence [32,33]. We refer also to the recent
work [34] concerning evolutionary models for knowledge. In fact, governments, international
organizations and social media companies have turned their attention to digital news consumers,
and particularly children and young adults. It is therefore of paramount importance to build
models capable of describing the interplay between the dissemination of fake news and the


creation of competence among the population. To this end, the approach we have followed
in this paper falls within the recent socio-economic modelling described by kinetic equations
(see [31] for a recent monograph on the subject).
