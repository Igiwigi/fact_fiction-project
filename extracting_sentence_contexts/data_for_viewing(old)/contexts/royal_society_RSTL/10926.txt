ON THE RELATIVE ACTION OF ALKALIES AND ALKALINE EARTHS ON MUSCLE.

We cannot enter here into a full consideration of the antagonism which certain
members of these groups show with regard to the action of other members, but we
may briefly state a few of the most striking facts. Thus potassium shortens the.
lengthened curves of veratria, barium (Plate 10, fig. 43), calcium, 8trontium, of large
doses of sodium and of lithium (Plate 10, fig. 44), and reduces the contracture which -
they have caused. Sodium, which we have shown in large doses to cause a
lengthened curve with increased contraction, adds to the length of calcium and
strontium when applied in strong solutions. Barium, when it has produced its
lengthened veratria-like curve, is, however, counteracted by almost all the substances
which tend to produce a shorter curve. Thus calcium and potassium both of them
lessen its altitude, and abolish its contracture. A remarkable antagonism, however,
is that existing between rubidium and barium. The veratria-like curve which the
former has been shown to cause when in strong solution is completely reduced by
the application of a solution of barium, of such a strength as would, if applied by
itself in the firs instance, have caused a similar, though more extensively varied,
