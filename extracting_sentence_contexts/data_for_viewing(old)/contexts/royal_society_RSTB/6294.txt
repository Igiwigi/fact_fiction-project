A study was made (Gates and Goopwin, 1931) of meiotic stages in O. blandina
and O. purpurata, two derivative forms of Oenothera having 7 free pairs of chromosomes,
and a rather meagre amount of evidence was obtained which was interpreted in
favour of parasynaptic pairing. The prophase thread was recognized as double,
with the two portions twisted about each other in the loop stage. The nature of
this doubleness will be considered later. From a large number of nuclei studied,
the chromosome pairs all formed complete rings at diakinesis. The only direct
evidence which could be interpreted as terminalization of chiasmata was one metaphase
plate with 7 pairs of rod chromosomes (fig. 35, Plate 18), a single one of which showed
a pair of granules on the connecting strands. It is important to remember that in
Oenothera free or uncatenated pairs of chromosomes normally form rings, i.e., they
are connected only at the ends. There is, moreover, a marked tendency for the
ring pairs to be interlinked with each other, which evidently results from the fact
that the chromosomes pair mainly at or near their ends. These conditions were
clearly illustrated in the paper mentioned and it was pointed out that, so far as
the middle portions of the chromosomes are concerned, the term asynapsis applied
to them, 2.e., these portions were, for the most part, not paired at any stage of their
development. CatTcHEsmpe (1931) was successful in obtaining more evidence of
chiasma formation in a study of a derivative of O. pallescens having a ring of 6
chromosomes and 4 ring bivalents. At that time it seemed not unreasonable to
