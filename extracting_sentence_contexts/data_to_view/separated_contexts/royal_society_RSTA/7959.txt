where all the coefficients conform to (119) except that

tet = 0: (125)
When (n+ p) is large the coefficients may be calculated from asymptotic formule
identical with those given for the previous set of coefficients. We have, in fact,

n (p+ 1) (n+ p— Ul ln,

pF Fly 1 (p — 1)!

Tr ~ Brn V(p — 2)! Of the values given in Tables XI to XIV, those for which » +- p > 22 have been
calculated from (126). For the others the general formule (119), (121) and (123) have
been used.
