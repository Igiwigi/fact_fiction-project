It is natural, perhaps, to ask whether there is a quantity related to orbital angular momentum
as helicity is related to spin [61]. It appears, however, that it is not possible to construct a
non-vanishing quantity of this sort. This may be appreciated by noting that the integrand of
L is perpendicular to the wavevector k at each point in reciprocal space [57,77,78] so that the
component of this integrand along k is zero, which is reminiscent of the fact that the projection
of a particle’s orbital angular momentum parallel to the particle’s direction of motion is zero, as
(rx 4) -r=0.

(c) Boost angular momenta

Our attention has been focused thus far on the familiar concept that rotations (of the usual,
circular character) in space are connected to the conservation of angular momenta. Somewhat
less familiar but equally important is the fact that light also carries angular momenta for which
the conservation is associated instead with ‘rotations’ of hyperbolic character in space-time.

The boost angular momentum

k= |[exp-re-E+B-m]av (2.14)

sits on equal footing with J in as much as the two appear together as parts of a more basic object:
the angular momentum tensor [36,79]. The conservation of boost angular momentum implies
that the centre of energy of the electromagnetic field moves with constant velocity [57,79] and
is associated with a boost rotational symmetry transformation which in infinitesimal form is [79]
