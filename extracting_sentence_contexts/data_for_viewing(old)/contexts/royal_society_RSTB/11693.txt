1. Introduction

In essence, all morphogenetic processes are the result of one or more self-
organized events governed by physical principles. This is illustrated by the
fact that a properly proportioned and physiologically active embryo, with all
its organs, can be generated from an externally fertilized egg. Identifying the
key features and understanding the underlying principles that guide specific
morphogenetic processes constitutes one of the major challenges in biology.
The discovery of oscillations in simple chemical systems and the formal descrip-
tion of reaction—diffusion processes paved the way for the understanding of the
physical principles governing many sub-cellular processes (reviewed in [1]).
The celebrated and highly influential theoretical work of Turing [2], who pre-
dicted the emergence of stable patterns via reaction—diffusion mechanisms,
has been the conceptual basis of much of the work on biological modelling.
This has been applied initially to describe signalling and patterning cues
[3-5], and more recently to the emergence of tissue and organ level structures
[6-8]. However, it is clear that other conceptual frameworks can also reach
