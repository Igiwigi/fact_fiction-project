It is almost as if different points of view have developed different languages. As a result, one may find it difficult to understand the ideas, as one often has to learn ‘the other
language’ used to discuss the same problem. This is further complicated by the fact that all of these
languages use essentially the same words, but charged with very different meanings. Concepts
like ‘existence’, ‘reality’ or ‘state’ are good examples. The aim of this section is to acknowledge this problem and to deal with it to the extent possible
within the framework of a brief guide.
