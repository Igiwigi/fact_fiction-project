ing each other, thus separating communication from
the very stimuli that normally drive it. In this way,
previous generations can influence later generations
far into the future.

But even immortalized communication is not
enough to explain cultural evolution. We can also
count on altruistic cooperation (Moll & Tomasello
2007) with the spectacular results produced by stable
social structures, such as cities, markets, temples,
courts of law, prisons, universities, satellite trans-

science fiction to imagine this proliferation even on
your new planet. Now, in human societies, we know

as the Ultimatum game and the Prisoner’s Dilemma.
