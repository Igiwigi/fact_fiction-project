Miss Gibbs also states (1912, p. 539) that in P. spicatus the apex of the strobilus is
always distinguishable beyond the last fertile bract.

A similar pushing aside of a primary apex by an enlarging seed has been well
known in Zaxus since Van TrecuEm discovered it in 1869 (loc. cit., p. 303, and
Plate 16, fig, 91; see also SrRASBURGER’s well-known figure, 1872, Plate 1, fig. 5).

The unripe seed is an almost perfect sphere, sessile on the apex of the receptacle,
with its axis inclined to that of the receptacle at an angle of about 45°. It thus
presents a strong contrast to the condition in Podocarpus, but approaches that in
some species of Daecrydium.

The seeds figured by Pricer (1902, p. 117) are all very nearly erect ; this fact may
quite possibly be due to his material being slightly older than that examined by me,
and may suggest that the young ovule is horizontal or even further inclined, as in some
species of Dacrydiuwm. However, in the absence of younger material. these remarks
ean only be taken as conjectures. (See also p. 285, below.) It is worth mentioning
that the seeds here described were collected in March, 1914, on Mount Mou.

The surface of the drupaceous seed is covered with bloom and is smooth except for
a slight ridge passing obliquely round the base of the seed, but not forming a
complete circle. If the seed is viewed from the ventral side (Plate 11, fig. 23), the
ridge is hardly visible.

The micropyle is distinctly two-lipped, the upper lip adpressed, the lower projecting
