248 SIR CHARLES BELL ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.

to remark, that between the opinions taught in the schools, and the inferences to be
deduced from the distribution of these nerves, there was no correspondence. Why do
six nerves pass into the orbit? Why should two nerves descend into the nose ? Why
should three nerves penetrate the coats of the eye? Why should some of these nerves
have ganglions on them and others none? If it be correct, that the brain is the offi-
cina spirituum, and gives out a common influence through the nerves, what is the
meaning of this intricacy in the distribution of the nerves? I then held the following
argument. Common occurrences, and the symptoms of disease, correspond with the
anatomical facts, while they are adverse to the received opinions.

1. A catarrhal inflammation of the membrane of the nose is attended with the loss
of the sense of smelling, and the increase of the sensibility to common irritation.
Does not this imply a difference in the functions of the first and of the fifth nerve ?
and that their offices are not transferable *

2. In performing the operation of couching the cataract, as the needle touches the
surface of the eye, it pricks it, and the patient feels a pain similar to what he would
do were the skin pricked ; but as the needle passes through the retina, he has a flash
of fire. * Does not this imply a difference of sensibility from the same injury, or the
same impulse? Do we not perceive that there is a nerve of vision, and a nerve appro-
priated to the external surface ?
