reducing the analytical results to numbers, and it may suffice to say that the task
proved to bea very laborious one.

The harmonic terms included in the computation were those of degree 2 and ranks
0 and 2, of degree 4 and ranks 0, 2, 4, and of degree 6 and ranks 0, 2, 4. The sixth
sectorial harmonic was omitted because its contribution would certainly prove
negligible.

The expression for Sw? was found in the form of a fraction, of which the denominator
is determinate and the numerator consists of the sum of an infinite series. Nine
terms of this series were computed, namely, a constant term and the contribution of
the eight harmonic terms specified above. I found, in fact, that it would only change
the numerator by about one-twentieth part of itself, if all the harmonics excepting
the zonal ones of degrees 2, 4, 6 had been dropped.

The result shows that the square of the angular velocity of the pear is less than
that of the critical Jacobian ellipsoid in about the proportion to 1 â€” $e? to1. On
the other hand the angular momentum of the pear is greater than that of the
ellipsoid in about the proportion of 1+ se? to 1. If this last result were based
on a rigorous summation of the infinite series, it would, in accordance with the
principle explained above, absolutely prove the stability of the pear. The inclusion
of the uncomputed residue of the series would undoubtedly tend in the direction
of reducing the coefficient given in round numbers as 3/5, and if it were to reduce it
to a negative quantity, we should conclude that the pear was unstable after all,
