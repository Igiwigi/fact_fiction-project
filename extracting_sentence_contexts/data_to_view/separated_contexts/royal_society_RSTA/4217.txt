d,, these leave over a finite
number of complementary intervals, say d’;, d’,...d’,,, and we can so choose 7 that

the sum of these latter intervals d’, is less than , while the contribution to our

ae
2M
summation over the remaining intervals d,,,, d,,»... is numerically less than $e.

If now we form the summation in RreMann’s way over the finite number of
intervals d,, d,... d,, d';, d’,... d’,, and compare it with the corresponding summation
over the set of intervals d,, d.... ad inf:, we see that the difference between the two
summations is less than e. Since ¢ is at our disposal, and we can insure that both
the intervals d, and d’, are less than any assigned norm, this proves the statement
embodied again in the following theorem :—

* I take this first opportunity of emphasising the fact that, though it is convenient, indeed necessary,
in forming the sum of an infinite number of terms to arrange them in some sort of order, in doing so here
we do not introduce the idea of order into the concept of integration. Indeed, from the definitions it is
evident that the concept of integration no more of itself involves the idea of order than do the concepts of
length, area, and volume. ‘The distinction of the two notions has, perhaps, not always been present to
the miud of some writers.
