Imagine starting many cell cultures in separate Petri dishes and watching their biomasses evolve
according to equation (2.1) for time T. Assume the dishes are large enough and T is short enough
that growth does not slow for want of agar. Equation (2.4) says that the observed growth rates
would be normally distributed around jz — 07/2, with time-decaying variance o?/T.

The negative term —o?/2 may be surprising, given that the multiplicative changes in equation
(2.1) are distributed symmetrically about jdt. It is, however, a well-known property, usually
derived using It6 calculus as in [22]. In simple terms, it reflects the fact that the product of the
symmetric perturbations of a number is less than its square, e.g. (1 + €)(1 — €) =1— <1.

The ensemble average (or expectation value) of resources is defined as

a LS
(xO) = lim 5 Do xi). (2.5)
i=l

Its evolution is computed by applying this operation to equation (2.1) to get
d(x(#)) =u (x(t) dé, (2.6)

since (dW;(t)) =0. With initial condition x;(0)=1 for all i, this describes exponential growth,
