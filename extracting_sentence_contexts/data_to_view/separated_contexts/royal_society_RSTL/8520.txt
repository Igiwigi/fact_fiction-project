'The mere fact of reaction to a stimulus is no proof of the existence
of sensation. The entire absence of reaction, however, observed in some of the preceding experi-
ments, where the hippocampal region was completely destroyed, is a strong proof of the
abolition of sensation, when it is considered that reaction was lively and marked on the
opposite side of the body at the same time. But the loss of tactile sensation is eyen more conclusively indicated by the fact that
monkeys in whom the hippocampal region was destroyed ceased to use the opposite
limbs for the purposes of prehension or the exercise of the faculty of touch. To react to tactile stimuli may signify reflex action or tactile sensation, or both ; to
touch necessarily, implies the possession of the power of tactile perception,

The condition of the limbs in these cases was such as to simulate motor paralysis; and
it is well known that Sir CuarLes BELL mistook the immobility of the side of the face
resulting. from anzesthesia caused by division of sensory branches of the fifth for real
motor paralysis.
