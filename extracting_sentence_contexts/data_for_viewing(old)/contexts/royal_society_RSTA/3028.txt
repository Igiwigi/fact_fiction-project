Theorem 1.2 generalized. In the main text, we did not explicitly include entropy associated with
infallen matter. Figure 4 shows the most general scenario. Subsystem I denotes the matter that
falls into the region surrounding the black hole where radiation is produced. Thus, we suppose
that late epoch radiation can, in principle, come from the joint subsystem (N, I). In this figure, we
also include subsystem Dearly denoting matter that has fallen into the region surrounding the black
hole at an earlier epoch or indeed matter that may have collapsed to form the black hole in the
first place.

As in the main text we apply strong subadditivity:

I(R’ | R) <I(C,N’, R’:R) =I(N, 1: R) =I(N: R). (A 12)

Here, we used the fact that joint subsystems (C, N’, R’) and (N,1) are unitarily related. Finally,
the most natural assumption is that the infallen matter I is independent of the quantum state of


the black hole, (B, N), or its early epoch radiation R. The original inequality of equation (A 1) for
pure-state black holes is thus found to still hold in the presence of mixed infallen matter.

From the summary above of generic radiation production including infallen matter we have
enough to generalize theorem 1.2. As in the main text, we take R to be all the early epoch radiation
until the PT (for this theorem we may take any generalized PT), and we let R’ denote all the
radiation generated from the PT onward until the black hole has shrunk to a size much smaller
than the original black hole (say roughly ¢/2 of its original area), but still much larger than the
Planck scale. In this case, instead of equation (A 4), we have
