The variableness of the first set of
results arises, I believe, from the uncertainty of the quantity
of ammonia decomposed. For if the smallest portion of mois-
ture remain in the tube, a little ammoniacal gas will be ab-
sorbed, and will be slowly given -out again as the electriza-
tion goes on, thus rendering the actual quantity submitted to
experiment greater than appears. It is probable, also, from a
fact which I shall afterwards state, that mercury itself, unless
when heated, may absorb a small portion of alkaline gas. The proportion of the hydrogen and nitrogen gases to each
other in the products of ammonia decomposed by electricity,
I am satisfied, by recent experiments (June, 1809) is as
nearly as possible what you have determined, viz. 74 mea-
ures of hydrogen gas to 26 of nitrogen.
