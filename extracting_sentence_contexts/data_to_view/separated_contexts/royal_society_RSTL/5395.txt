On the other hand, the indulgence of
an extravagant Pyrrhoniſm may prove equally
detrimental in every.endeavour to extend the bounds
of ſcience, It may prevent the giving due weight to
matters of real information, and hinder their being
made uſeful. For my own part, I ſhould think it
an indignity offered to the Royal Society, to lay be-
fore you any extraordinary phenomenon, which is
ſupported only by a flight degree of evidence. On
the contrary, when a number of concurrent circum-
ſtances tend to eſtabliſh a fact, we ought not in a
certain degree to refuſe our aſſent to it, though ſome-
what out of the common courſe. 'Thus in the caſe
before us; when an unuſual diſeaſe of ſeveral months
continuance, and when the patient was ſuppoſed to
be reduced to the laſt extremity; when medicines
and applications of every kind, celebrated by the
ableſt writers and practitioners both antient and mo-
dern, :had been tried with little - or no effe&, at leaſt
-with -regard to the rigidity; when during a courſe
. of eleftriſing no medicines or applications of any kind
«were made ule of; when likewiſe, during this
.courſe, the. patient voided no worms, had no purg-
-ings, eruptions on the ſkin, or kindly impoſtuma-
tions, which might have been conſidered as critical
diſcharges, and to have brought about the cure;
when, I fay, none of theſe things happened, and

the patient under electrifing only, and that at a very

ſevere ſeaſon of the year, has been reſtored to perfect

health, I cannot refuſe my aſſent in believing it

effected by the power of electricity.
