Therefore, a crucial step is to develop
methods for measuring and interpreting uncertainty in estimates of social mobility. The Glicko-rating, randomized Elo-
rating and percolation and conductance (PERC) methods incorporate approaches for quantifying uncertainty around inferred
dominance ranks or scores [45,49,58], but no study has yet used these uncertainty estimates when inferring hierarchy
dynamics.

when instead they will eventually enjoy dominant status, and more tolerant of despotism by dominants [64]. Subordinate
