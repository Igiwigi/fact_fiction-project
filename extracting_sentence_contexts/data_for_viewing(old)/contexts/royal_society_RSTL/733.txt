The pulmonary veins were four in number; but neither the
area of these veins, nor that of the vessel which acted as the
pulmonary artery, exceeded half the common dimensions.

This child, when alive, came under the observation of Dr.
Comsr, who did not perceive that its respiration, temperature,
or muscular action, were materially affected. In the records
of malformation of the heart, the present case is extraordinary,
resembling in organization the amphibious animals, rather than
the mammalia. That an infant should have existed so long,
under such circumstances, carrying on all the vital functions,
appears a physiological fact of s0me importance, especially as
the dependence of life on respiration, and the changes pro-
duced in the vascular system, are s0 imperfectly understood.
