This proposition exactly corresponds with the proposition in section 17 of Chapter I.
36. Assuming now the axes of coordinates to be rectangular, we know, from formulze
(I.) in section 24 of Chapter IT., that det (Q, Q) has for its components
q.-7,—04,7. parallel to Oz,
4:7.—4:7, parallel to Oy,
9,7,—4., parallel to Oz. Therefore it follows from the preceding section, that the components of D, (Q) are

age

a F121
F/

+ qo9:—41:7o
dq:

at +9,7:—0:7y

These formulz are in fact simply the analytical expression of the fundamental propo-
sition in the preceding section, and correspond exactly to the formule in section 18 of

Chapter I.
37. Let us now apply the above formulz to dynamics, and first to the velocity of a

particle. Suppose, then, a particle to move in space in any manner whatsoever, and swpp'
inates revolve about a line Q at time # with angular velocity

the rectangular axes of coord om :
