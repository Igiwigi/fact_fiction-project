If, then, the object-glass be not accurately achromatised the one reflector may
be focussed accurately for blue rays and the other for red rays. Thus we should have
one star intrinsically redder than the other. In consequence of these considerations,
we used, whenever we noticed a difference in colour, to mention the fact, in order that
this cause of inaccuracy in the observation might be taken account of, We did not
take particular notice which star was red and which blue, though we sometimes noted
the fact. We had no idea that any information might be gained by always noticing
which star was red and which one blue. On different days the distinetness and steadiness of the stars varied enormously.
e days when the stars were steady and distinet were the days on which we got
best observations, and felt most certainty about the exact speeds which produced
eguality in the two stars, except that it was often on these days that the difference in
our troubled us most.
= 0n the 11th February, 1881, we were making the regular observations for determin-
ing the speed of revolution of the toothed wheel required to give the 12th, 13th, and
14th equalities, corresponding to speeds of about 410, 450, and 490 revolutions a
