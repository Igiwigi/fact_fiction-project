Thus it appears that the great inferiority of heat developed by the mining as
compared with the Spanish powder is compensated, or at least approximately 80, by
the great superiority in volume of permanent gases produced. A similar relation
is observed in respect to the other powders, and it may indeed be noted that the
products of the figures given in columns 2 and 3 in Table VIII, do not differ greatly
from a constant value; thus pointing towards the conclusion that the pressures at
any given density and the capacity for performing work of the various powders are
not very materially different. This fact has been entirely verified for the whole of the Waltham Abbey powders,
and in a less degree for the three other powders also. Thus at the points where the Spanish, mining, and CurTIs and Harvey's No. 6
powders have been compared with the standard pressure curves determined from

and pressure specified, is equivalent to the assertion that the permanent gases occupy 2783 times the 8pace
which the powder occupied in its unexploded tate, the grayimetric density of the powder being assumed
to be unity.
