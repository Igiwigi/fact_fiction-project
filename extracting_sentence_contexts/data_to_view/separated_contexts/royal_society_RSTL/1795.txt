if,
the respiration being suspended, an animal appeared to be dying, the heat
of the heart and the signs of life were speedily restored, on performing arti-
ficial respiration, or even by forcing air through the trachea, bronchia, and
pulmonary air-cells and allowing it to escape through incisions made through
the pleura. It was, in the next place, clearly shown by GoopwyN, in one of the most
beautiful specimens of physiological inquiry in any language+, that in sus-
pended respiration, it is the left side of the heart which first ceases to contract,
the right side still continuing its function for several minutes, antil the snp-
ply of blood may be supposed to fail. The facts detailed by Harvey had shown that the left side of the heart was
endued with less irritability than the right ; the experiment of Hook, that re-
spiration restored the action of the heart, if it had previously ceased ; that of
Goopwvyn, that this cessation and restoration of functions were observed in
the left side of the heart. It was obvious, on the other hand, that the re-
spiration belongs, as it were, to the left side of the heart. It appears plainly deducible from these facts, that in circumstances and
structures the most similar, the respiration is accurately inyersely as the irri-
tability.
