THE STRUCTURE OF HAIR, WOOL, AND RELATED FIBRES. 97

repetition along the fibre axis—what we have called above the “ pseudo-translation ”—
is 5-15 A.U., a length which is now recognised as that of a glucose residue, a hexagonal
ring built up of five carbon atoms and an oxygen atom, with another oxygen atom acting
as a “ bridge ” to the next hexagonal ring, thus :—

We wish to suggest here that the basis of the unstretched fibrous keratins is a series of
hexagonal ring systems linked along the fibre axis by“ bridge atoms,” in a manner analogous
to what is generally accepted for the cellulose and related structures. In point of fact,
there is a considerable body of evidence in favour of such a hypothesis. The keratins
are remarkably resistant to chemical reagents, and they are not attacked by pepsin,
trypsin, or bacterial tryptases. An open peptide chain seems quite out of the question
in the «-form of hair.
