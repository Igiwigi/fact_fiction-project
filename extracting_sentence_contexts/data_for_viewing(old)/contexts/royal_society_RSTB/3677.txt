a freehand sketch of live individuals. The junction seems superficially to be
extraordinarily close, suggesting fusion even under a high-power lens, nevertheless
the specimens have always come apart again, the longest period of apposition
observed being 35 minutes. Usually the individuals are quite similar to one
another ; on one occasion, however, in the case of a 3rd day fly, they showed a slight
amount of differentiation, one being rather more slender than the other. The
“male” type (fig. 43), discussed earlier in the paper, was not involved in any of these
cases, in all of which the trypanosomes were of the blood type.

This is the sum of the direct evidence from live observation that I have been able
to obtain in the course of more than a year’s search, and it is obviously inadequate.
The trypanosomes do not live long enough under the cover-slip to give satisfactory
opportunities for this kind of observation. The fact that the divisions are so very
characteristic and so constant in type would admit of valuable deductions being made
from the stained material, were it not that the multiple degeneration and involution
forms obviously rob these of all their value. It must also be considered whether
conjugation might not take place in the salivary gland. Direct evidence there is
none, and live observations are even more hopeless here, as the trypanosomes from
the glands are extraordinarily sensitive to the unfavourable conditions of the slide.
