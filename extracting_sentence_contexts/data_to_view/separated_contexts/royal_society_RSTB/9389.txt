It would also
allow forensic institutes to develop powerful forensic intelli-
gence tools to reveal potential case and _ evidence
connections, to better understand criminal activities, to moni-
tor and optimize policing, to improve the efficiency of
forensic investigations and to assist in crime prevention and
disruption [11-14]. The design, implementation and conse-
quences of integrated forensic platforms will be discussed
in more detail in §3.

technologies

The first hours of a crime scene investigation, the so-called
‘golden hours’, are often of crucial importance for the
police to get more information about the identity of potential
suspects and to obtain relevant facts and data. Especially in
high profile cases, the criminal justice system has a strong
need for immediate information to focus the investigation
and formulate plausible scenarios. In the forensic setting,
the time from when the crime scene sample is secured to
when the results are reported in the forensic testimony
is defined as the turnaround time.
