2nd and 3rd, where either the positive or negative terminal can be made either
to oxidate or reduce, according to the nature of the chemical medium present, while
these experiments are entirely in accordance with, and the results of them flow as a
necessary consequence of, the view first advanced. The other theory which may be
advanced is, that by dielectric induction the gases may be bodily separated, a layer,
not molecular, but corporeal or yoluminous, if I may be allowed these expressions, of
oxygen being developed on the side next the anode, and one of hydrogen next the
cathode, the gas intervening between the terminals being thus divided, as it were,
into two halves: this would certainly be a most curious phenomenon, but I believe
it to be 80 inconsistent with the vast mass of accumulated facts in electrical science,
and likely to have produced in cosmical phenomena 80 many results which, if exist-
ing, must long ere this have been detected, that I will not do more than advert
to it. I have adopted the views which I have first stated as being the least removed from
ordinary theories or modes of regarding electrical phenomena, and because in the
present instance I can present the phenomena in no other way which is in the least
degree satisfactory to my own mind, while this view to me well accounts for them.
