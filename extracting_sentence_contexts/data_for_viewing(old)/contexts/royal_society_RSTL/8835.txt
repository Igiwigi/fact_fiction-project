The Connective-tis8ue Reticulum among the Columnar Fpithelium.

This reticulum is, in its character, exactly like that which has been already described
among the epithelium of the intestine, and can be best seen among the epithelium of the
ducts (se fig. 35, Plate 43). It is much harder to demonstrate its occurrence among the
epithelium of the surface of the plicz villos ; and though it does exist even among that
epithelium, it is very fine and delicate, and does not appear to reach the surface. There
is, however, an intercellular 8ubstance uniting the upper surfaces of the epithelial cells,
which differs very materially from the connective-tissue reticulum, in the fact that it
does not stain at all in hematoxylin,
