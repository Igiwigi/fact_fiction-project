which, (though fully aware of the weight of those arguments
you lately urged in conversation, as unfavourable to the pro-
bability of their high antiquity) I am still led to consider as
not altogether uninteresting to the geologist. The neglect of
the more recent formations of rocks was one principal cause
that the nature and origin of the older had been 80 strangely

osseous relics of a later period are more particularly calculated
to furnish data for the future construction of a philosophical
