Received November 26, 1873,—Read January 8, 1874*,

WiepEMAxN has experimentally examinedf the influence of magnetism upon the mecha-
nical torsion of iron wire, and has shown that an iron wire hung in the centre of a
helix and twisted is more or less untwisted when a current trayerses the helix. But
as the torsion in his experiments was produced by the combined influence of a yoltaic
current and previous mechanical twist, and is quite a distinct phenomenon from that
produced by the combined influence of electric currents only, which forms the snbject
of this communication, and as no one appears to haye discovered the particular class
of phenomena which are treated of in this investigation, I take an opportunity of
making known my experiments and the new facts TI have found.

[Since the publication of the abstract of this paper in the © Proceedings of the Royal
Society,” vol, xxii. p. 57, January 8, 1874, Professor WiEDEMANN (to whom I had sent
a copy of that abstract) has kindly written to me as follows :—* You have found inde-
pendently some resnlts which I had already published in the year 1862 in Pogces-
= DoRee's © Annalen,” yol. cxvii. p. 208. A short abstract of these experiments is also
given in my © Treatise on Galvanism, &c.” (1st edition, vol. ii. p. 445 ; 2nd edition, vol. ii.
ÞP- 965), where you will find my complete theory of the relations between magnetism
> and torsion.”]
