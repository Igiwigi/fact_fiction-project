The renewed interest in angular momentum (AM) of
radiation fields that started 25 years ago did not arise
from the discovery that optical AM exists. In fact, in
the very first sentences of [1], it is stated that this is a
well-known result of Maxwellâ€™s theory, and explained
in textbooks on electrodynamics. The novelty of this
work consists of the explicit expressions for the density
of orbital AM of Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) light beams. It was argued that these beams possess a well-defined
component of orbital AM along the beam axis.
