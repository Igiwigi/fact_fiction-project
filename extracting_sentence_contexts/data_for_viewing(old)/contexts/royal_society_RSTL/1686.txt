of water and oxygene; for cuprane, I have found, though appa-
rently not in the least acted on by dry oxygene gas, is quickly
changed when moistened with water and confined in a jar of
this gas, and there is a rapid absorption of oxygene,*

I have not examined all the specimens obtained by these
different methods minutely, though sufficiently, I conceive, to

that of the native, in a finely divided state, When heated,
they all afford water, oxygene gas, and a mixture of cuprane
and brown oxide of copper.

I have analysed only the submuriat, precipitated from a
