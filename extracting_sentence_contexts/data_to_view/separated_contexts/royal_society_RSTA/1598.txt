Can light sheet microscopy and SIM, with multiple pattern orientations,
be properly combined? As noted in §8, light sheet and SIM appear to be a perfect match: light sheet microscopy is limited
in resolution due to the relatively low numerical aperture objectives used, but generates very little
out-of-focus light—the bane of SIM. However, traditional light sheet SIM (LSFM-SIM) suffers
from the relatively coarse illumination pattern that can be provided by the excitation objective
in LSFM systems and the fact that only one orientation of the pattern is present. As such, while
improvements in axial resolution can be made, very little useful enhancement of lateral resolution
is possible. In an attempt to counter these issues, Manton & Rees proposed an LSFM-SIM system featuring
three mutually orthogonal objectives [103].
