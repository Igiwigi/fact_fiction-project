The meeting
of the exoccipitals across the middle line is cited by Grecory* as occurring in
Cynodonts, and as one of their primitive reptilian characters. The more anterior suture lies between the basioccipital and the basisphenoid in the
neighbourhood of the sagittal plane (text-fig. 4, Section 77); in the more lateral
sections, where the pro-otic rests on the basioccipital, the suture lies between the
basisphenoid on the one side and the basioccipital, plus the pro-otic, on the other
(text-fig. 4, Sections 85 to 93), The course of the suture as seen in a vertical section
is oblique. The basioccipital is deeply grooved on the ventral surface, or to express
the same fact otherwise, its ventral surface is produced downwards on each side to
form a pair of prominences (the hypapophyses of Owrn and others) which
constitute the wall of the lower and inner part of the bony capsule surrounding
the enormous vestibule of the ear, recently described by Broom.+ The basisphenoid
contributes to the anterior wall of this prominence, but it does not extend on to
the parotic processes, as Broom seems to suppose when he says: “The basisphenoid
sends two large plates backwards to clasp the large paroccipital processes.”

The dorsal surface of the basioccipital at its anterior end is overlaid, except for a
very narrow band in the median line, by the pro-otic, and this is raised in front
into a pair of pointed ascending processes to which the basisphenoid also contributes. The basisphenoid is also grooved ventrally for a short distance in its posterior
region, a pair of lateral ridges on its ventral surface being the portions just mentioned
which are applied to the ventral ridges of the basioccipital. A canal (Plate 17, tig. 1, immediately below the letters B.S.) traverses the basi-
sphenoid in the middle ee vertically : it is apparently the internal carotid canal{
which Sretey described as forked.
