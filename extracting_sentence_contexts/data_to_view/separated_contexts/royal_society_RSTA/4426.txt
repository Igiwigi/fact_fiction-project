Indeed, the deviation from
the five classicality conditions we have identified is surprisingly independent of the specific
exemplar that is considered, nor does it depend on the specific pair of concepts that are
measured. In other words, the numerical value of, say, I, is the same when different exemplars
are considered, and it is not affected by the specific pair of concepts that are measured. In
addition, I, and Ig, and also I and Ip, have approximately the same numerical value, and the


slight deviation between their values can be attributed to the fact that a positive or a negative
concept is considered. As a consequence, this deviation of classicality cannot be attributed
to an underlying non-classical mechanism of conceptual combination, because the numerical
value of the functions I4, Ig, etc. would then depend on whether ‘A and B’, ‘A and B”, ‘A’
and B’ or ‘A’ and B” is considered—in I4 more negative concepts appear than in I,4. This
is why, we think, this deeper phenomenon could not have been detected in a less symmetric
experimental setting only, aiming at detecting overextension, as we have explained in §1.
