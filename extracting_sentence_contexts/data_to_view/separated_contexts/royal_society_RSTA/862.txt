Let A be the value of this product, then

AIL [«, +h—7]!=[3]!4,

where ¢ is an integral function of z.
Let ¥ (z) be an integral function of z with integral coeflicients, then if

y (2) ra 0,
when z is any root of z*=1, 4 (z) has a factor z* — 1. Now ¢ is zero when
a,—r= a,—#, and a, —r, «,— 1 only appear as indices of z, thus ¢ is zero

whenever z7"~' = zt‘, i.e, ¢ has a factor

ji gar t-r

Thus ¢ is a function which contains all the factors of

Il fe, —«, +? —7],

rt
In view of the fact that %,, %, ....%, may be looked on at present as arbitrary

h
numbers, the only necessarily repeated factor in this is (1 — 2),
Now when z approaches the value 1, we may take 1 — z = ¢ a small quantity. Then when Z is small

[A] = AC; and

A 8 tp oh

\(a,—r-+s)!
