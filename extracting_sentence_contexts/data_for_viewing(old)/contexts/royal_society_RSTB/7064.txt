reasons, they concluded that the inhibition of water excretion by short-lived exercise was
due to the emotional accompaniment of that exercise. Emotional stress alone produced
a similar type of inhibition, an inhibition which was independent of the endogenous release
of adrenaline and yet humorally determined; and its course was accurately matched by
a similar dose of post-pituitary extract. The evidence, therefore, was strongly in favour of
a pituitary mechanism underlying the reaction. Rydin & Verney also pointed out that if
such was the case, there could be little doubt that the supraoptico-hypophysial tract was
the nervous pathway by which the pituitary was activated. The correctness of this inference
was shown by O’Connor & Verney (1942) by the demonstration that the inhibition of a
water diuresis by emotional stress in the dog was largely reduced by the removal of the
infundibular lobe of the hypophysis. The operative approach to the pituitary was by
Aschner’s diasphenoid route, and the fact that the infundibular stem and median eminence
were left intact probably accounted for the fact that the post-operative urinary output was
within normal limits, and also for the slight inhibitory response that could still be evoked
by an emotional stimulus. The evidence, then, for the pituitary hypothesis so far as the
emotional inhibition of a water diuresis is concerned is very strong, and it seems likely that
the same mechanism underlies, at least in part, the response to muscular exercise.

Another type of stimulus, an afferent nerve stimulus, has also been shown to inhibit a
water diuresis, and there is much evidence that the response is mediated through the
pituitary gland also. It was first shown by Theobald (1934), whilst repeating some experi-
