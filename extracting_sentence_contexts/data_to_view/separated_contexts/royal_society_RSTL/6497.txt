Therefore, if L, M, N be the moments of the forces about the axes, we have, as before,

L=%*+h,o,—hw,
M= = +h,,—ha,

N=" +1,o,—ha,

If, on the other hand, the axes of Os, Oy, Oz are not fixed in the body, but rotate with

an angular velocity whose components are ,, 7,, 7, then we have, in a similar manner,
L=*+h,z,—hz, &c. The above equations are somewhat more general than those given by LrouvILam in
his Journal of 1858, and are, as we haye just seen, at once obtained by applying the
fundamental formulze of section 36. ;

moving about a fixed point without assuming the principle of virtual velocities, and is in
fact a very simple deduction from D'ALEMBERT'S principle. + Ss

Let O# be the instantaneous axis, about which the body is rotating n
at time # with an angular velocity s. Let be a particle of the body, |= -
let its mass be m, its distance from O 7, r, and its velocity v in the
