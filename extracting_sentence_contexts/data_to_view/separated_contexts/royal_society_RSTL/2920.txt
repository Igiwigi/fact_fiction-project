But in these comparisons we must
observe that the activity of respiration is equal in the individuals which are compared. Thus although the respiratory organs are larger in the pupa than in the larya, the phy-
8lological condition of the insect is lower, its respiration is inactive. These facts, it
will be een, are all in strict accordance with each other, and point to the chemical
changes in the air during respiration as the immediate source of animal heat. But it
may be matter of inquiry how it is that the heat evolved within the body of the insect,
during respiration, becomes evident 80 rapidly. This, it may be urged, tends to show
that it results from the influence of the neryous system.
