and 1 millim. pressure. The facts can, however, be explained in another way. During the action of the
SPRENGEL pump sufficient electricity is 80metimes generated to render the fall tubes
Inminous in the dark (52). Tt is conceivable that under 8uch electrical influence
the falling mercury may be able to decompose aqueous vapour at these high exhaustions,
with formation of oxide of mercury and liberation of hydrogen.
