For instance, in such closely allied species as Onoclea sensibilis, L., and
Onoclea struthiopteris, Sw., the one has a creeping, the other an upright stock. But
though many instances might be quoted as showing the instability of the characters
of the axis, even within the limits of the genus, still in certain tribes there is a
constancy which cannot be ignored. The creeping axis is characteristic of the
Gleicheniacese, Lygodium, Matonia, Loxsoma, most Hymenophyllacee, Dennstedtia,
Microlepia, and Davallia ; in fact, it is the prevalent form in those Ferns which
illustrate the probable transition from Simplices to Gradatze and Mixte. It has been
suggested to me that, under circumstances of stress, the creeping stem would be more
likely to survive than the upright, or arborescent. The Lycopodinez are a good
example of this; the aborescent forms are extinct, and the creeping or epiphytic
species of Lycopodium and Selaginella survive.
