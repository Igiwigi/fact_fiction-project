Fig. 22, Plate 7, is a photograph of the comparator, with one
of the end mirror holders removed, arranged for the comparison of the X-gauge with
the composite gauge. In brief, then, the method of comparing a wave-length of light with one of the
present fundamental standards of length consists of a minimum of seven operations :—

(a) Determination of the number of waves of a monochromatic radiation contained
in a Fabry-Perot étalon approaching 10 cm. in length ;

(b) Optical comparison of the first étalon with a second of intermediate length by
the use of BRewsTEr’s fringes in white light ;

(c) Optical comparison of the second étalon with a third, of length somewhat greater
than the fundamental unit of length, by the same method as in () ;

(d) Direct determination of the difference between the lengths of the third étalon
and an end-gauge of length nominally equal to one of the fundamental units,
in terms of the same monochromatic radiation as used in (a) ;

(e) Direct optical comparison of the end-gauge mentioned in (d) with a composite
gauge of special construction, in terms of the same monochromatic radiation ;

(f) Comparison of the composite gauge, in a line-standard comparator, with a reference
line-standard which has been compared with the Prototype ;

(g) Comparison of the reference standard with the Prototype in a line-standard
comparator. With regard to the last two operations, the introduction of the reference line-
standard, or Prototype copy, is rendered necessary by the fact that the use of the

Prototypes is legally restricted to comparisons with their copies at certain prescribed
times, and that it is the copies which serve as the bases of comparison during inter-
mediate periods,

For the provisional measurements of the Metre, the results of which are quoted

later in this paper, two further stages were involved between (f) and (g). The inter-
mediate line-standard employed for comparison with the composite end-bar was the
nickel bar which constitutes the reference standard of the Laboratory. This bar has
been compared with the working standards of the Bureau International both directly
and through the agency of the British National Copy of the Metre.
