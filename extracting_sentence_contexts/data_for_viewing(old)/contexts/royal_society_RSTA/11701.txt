nearly steady. A was then opened and B shut off, so that the final readings were
taken with the pure gas from A passing through the apparatus. The process could
be repeated until A was empty, by which time B was half empty. A was then
replaced by a full bottle, and B was used for supplying the gas while the measurements
were being taken, and so on.

This method enables one to make use of all the gas from the bottles, and yet to use
only pure CO, when taking the actual measurements. As a matter of fact, the
presence of a small quantity of air in the CO, only produces a very small effect on the
measured value of the specific heat. The volumes of air and CO, which flow through
the fine tubes for a given pressure difference between their ends are practically the
same as may be seen from the calibration tables; further, the thermal capacities of
equal volumes of air and CO, are in the ratio 1 to 0°77. Hence, if as much as
1 per cent. of CO, were replaced by an equal volume of air, which would leave the
apparent value of Q unchanged, the thermal capacity would only be reduced by
0°23 per cent. It is probable that in no case was there more than 0°4 per cent. of air
in the CO, when the measurements were taken, as the bottles had always been
running for some time before the temperature conditions had become steady, so that
the effect of the presence of air in the CO, never probably amounted to more than
one or two parts per thousand on the energy supplied in any experiment.
