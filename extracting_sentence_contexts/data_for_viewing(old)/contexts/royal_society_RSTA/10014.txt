These agree well with those obtained from Set A, and testify to the fact that the lines
of Group III., when reversed, fall approximately in Group II.

The ratio of the displacements of the unreversed to those of the reversed lines of
Group III. is for Set A 1°6, and for Set B 1-7, if the general directions of the curves
be considered. From individual values at the pressures at which actual readings
have been made, the ratio is very much higher, but the uncertain region, 15 to 30
atmospheres, has then an undue influence.

Diagram VIII. emphasizes the possibility of subdividing Group I.
