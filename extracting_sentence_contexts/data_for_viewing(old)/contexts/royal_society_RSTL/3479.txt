If a temperature be applied to this salt sufficiently high to expel the water, it be-
comes partly decomposed, and was hence analysed only in this hydrated condition.
If when in this state it is boiled with water it becomes completely decolorized, and
the tin is changed into the form of peroxide, a grayish white compound is produced,
which rapidly absorbs oxygen, and generates, thereby, a red compound of regenerated
azolitmine with peroxide of tin. The exact nature of the reaction to which this effect
is due, will be examined in detail hereafter.

This azolitmine, which is the only constituent of litmus containing azote, appears
by the analytical results just given to be connected in a most simple and remarkable
manner with the principles of archil, alphaorceine and betaorceine. In fact, the pro-
portion of carbon, of hydrogen, and of azote being the same in these bodies, they
differ only in the quantity of oxygen they contain, their formula: being

Alphaorceine . . . C,, Hy, NO,.
Betaorceine. . . . C,, Hy, NO,.
Azolitmine . . . . C,, Hy NO,

As in this portion of the paper I wish to confine myself to experimental results, T
shall not enter now into any consideration of their theoretical nature, further than
to notice, that as in the series of erythrolein and erythrolitmine, although these bo-
dies are simply produced by the continued action of oxygen, yet when once formed
they cannot be looked upon as oxides of the same compound radical, but are s8ub-
