Nalbandian et al. [57] have investigated La,_,SryMO3 (M = Mn, Fe; x = 0-1)
perovskites for thermochemical syngas production using CH4 and H20 as reactants at 1273 K. Notably, the addition of 5% NiO on Laj_,SryFeO3 is reported to produce maximum Hy [58]. Beside the fact of lowering the reaction temperature, use of CH4 and H2O as reactants suffers from
significant coke formation. The Laj_,Sr;MnQO3 (LSM) family of perovskites has been successfully
applied for reduction of CO2 and H2O by using the two-step process. In LSM, replacement of trivalent La by divalent Sr creates holes located at the Mn sites,
creating Mn>+ /Mnâ€˜** pairs.
