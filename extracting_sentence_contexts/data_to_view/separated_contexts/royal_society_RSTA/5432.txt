It follows that the main physical effects of a are those that were considered in
dealing with the Haut effect. E. Contact Electromotive Force. 99, Our knowledge of this is not very accurate, but, besides the fact that contact-
force certainly exists, and that it has been in numerous individual cases measured
with fair accuracy, the following seems to stand out with considerable certainty. If the (apparent) electromotive force from one material, a, to another, b, when they
are in contact be denoted by a | b, then the equation

@[b+blefoja=O «©. eee ere (1)
is true if all three materials are conductors, but is not true if they are not all
conductors.
