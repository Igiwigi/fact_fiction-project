For instance, in Lepot et al. [12], we report a scaling
exponent y ~ 0.55 for the scaling-law Nu ~ RaY at Pr =7. Assuming that the flow becomes fully


turbulent at large driving amplitude, the slight departure of the measured exponent from 1/2
must be attributed to finite-Reynolds-number effects. As a matter of fact, we showed in Lepot
et al. using DNS that the scaling exponent y is indeed much closer to 1/2 for Pr=1 than for
Pr=7, the former corresponding to reduced viscous effects. The upper bounds (2.28) and (2.34)
are also fully compatible with the scaling predictions that we put forward in [14,15] with regard
to the dependence of the Nusselt number on Ra, Pr and the dimensionless absorption length Â¢. By contrast, the upper bounds challenge some scaling predictions recently put forward in [39] for
CISS: out of the five scaling regimes proposed in [39], three correspond to a scaling exponent y > 1
and are thus discarded by the general upper bound (2.34).
