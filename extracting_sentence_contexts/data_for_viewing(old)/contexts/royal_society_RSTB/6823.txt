size and complex structure, and to be infectious in dilutions of 10-8 to 10-!°. There
seems to be good reason for identifying them with the virus itself.

Bernal and Fankuchen claim that these protein molecules won from the different
strains or mutations of common tobacco mosaic so far examined can be recognized by
differences of structure as exhibited by X-ray examination; these differences one
presumes are based on changes affecting certain groups or radicles in the virus mole-
cule itself. The various strains of the X virus here recorded may all be regarded as of
this nature.

Protective inoculation demonstrates that a non-virulent strain affords complete
protection against the most virulent, and that such protection is specific. If such
protection is due, as is suggested, to the fact that the prior attachment of the virus
molecule to the plant protein prevents the subsequent attachment of a second related
strain, then the radicle by which such attachment is attained must be distinct from
that producing virulence. We may designate this as “A” in the X virus molecule.

Strains X¥, X°, X, and X¢ of the X virus produce either no visible symptoms under
the Cambridge conditions, as in the case of X”, or various types of mottle, as in the
case of the others; but none of the four strains induce necroses local or systemic. The
strains X° and X” produce both necrotic local and systemic lesions. Here then is a
definite differentiation between the two groups which makes itself very apparent not
only when they are the only infective agents present but also when either of these two
groups of strains are in association with unrelated viruses such as that of tobacco
mosaic.
