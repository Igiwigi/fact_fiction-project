TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN, APRIL 16, 1893. 603

The “ Reversing Layer.”

As a result of solar spectroscopic observations, combined with laboratory work,
Dr. Frankianpd and myself came to the conclusion, in 1869, that at least in one
particular Krrcunorr’s theory of the solar constitution required modification. In
that year we wrote as follows * :—* May not these facts indicate that the absorption
to which the reversal of the spectrum and the Fraunhofer lines are due takes place
in the photosphere itself, or extremely near to it, instead of in an extensive outer
absorbing atmosphere ?”

In an early observation of a prominence on April 17, 1870, I found hundreds of
the Fraunhofer lines bright at the base, and remarked that ‘a more convincing
proof of the theory of the solar constitution put forward by Dr. Frankianp and
myself could scarcely have been furnished.” +

During the eclipse of 1870, at the moment of disappearance of the sun, a similar
reversal of lines was noticed ; we had, to quote Professor Young, “ a sudden reversal
into brightness and colour of the countless dark lines of the spectrum at the com-
