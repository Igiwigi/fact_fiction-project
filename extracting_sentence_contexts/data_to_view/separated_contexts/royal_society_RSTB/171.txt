The face-area, although we have so called it for convenience sake, actually gives
rise to movements not only of the facial muscles, but also of the whole of the upper
part of the alimentary tube (mouth, throat, and larynx). It comprises the whole of
the ascending parietal and frontal convolutions below the arm-area, extending down
to the fissure of Synv1us, and including the external surface of the operculum. It is
physiologically remarkable from the fact that many of the movements which result
from its excitation are apt to be executed bilaterally, which is only exceptionally the
case with excitation of the other areas (except that for the head and eyes). Excitation of the upper third or half of the area causes winking, or closure of the
eyelids, elevation of the ala of the nose, and retraction and elevation of the angle
of the mouth. This may be termed the wpper fuce-centre.
