in any of the preceding seven generations either. In the six generations covered by
the polyclonal population, however, eight out of the 62 clones produced one or more
males, No sexual females were observed at all during the experiment. The first
males to appear were in Generation 2, therefore among the grandchildren of the
original ex-ephippio ancestors.

Preparation of the Data for Statistical Treatment.

The methods and units of measurement have already been detailed. So also have
the precautions taken to insure the conditions being similar for all individuals. On
coming to work out the results, however, it was found that either the conditions had
fluctuated more than had seemed likely at the time or that S. exspinosus was more
sensitive to changes than had been realised. This was shown by the following facts
concerning the monoclonal population.

The 70 original ancestors of this population were all born within a period of about
20 hours. As the generations succeeded one another, however, the interval between
the birth of the first and last members of each generation lengthened out, so that in
Generation 5 this interval had reached the length of four days. It soon became
obvious that this was too long a period for the conditions to remain constant enough
to avoid serious disturbances. This was shown by the parental correlation coefticients,
which for the birth measurements fluctuated round zero but ranged from +0°303 to
—0°356. It became quite clear that this was due to conditions changing in the
interval between the births of the first and last members of each generation. When
two generations happened both to be born at a period of improving or deteriorating
