ventricle by muscular transmission. Such simultaneity or approximate simultaneity
can, we think, only be effected by nervous channels, and that conduction by nervous
channels plays a part in the simultaneous and co-ordinated action constituting a beat
is supported by other considerations, by measurements of the rate of conduction, for
instance, such as we have given above, and still more strongly, we think, by the
electrometer sequence repeatedly observed by us when the heart is dying and its
parts becoming evidently asynchronous in their action, viz., negativity of auricle,
followed by negativity of apex, followed by negativity of base. This can consist
only with the existence of nervous channels along which excitatory impulses have
passed from auricle to the apex. (Photo. 7.)

Usually it is not till several minutes have elapsed after excision that the diphasic
variation is seen. It doubtless depends on the fact that with the slowness of action
asynchronism of acting parts becomes manifest, but whether we have to do with a

much retarded transmission from part to part along nerves or with muscular conduc-
tion is difficult to say with certainty ; the entire similarity of the wave with a muscular
wave is, however, sufficiently obvious. Finally, when transmission can no longer be
effected, the heart responds to local excitation by a monophasic variation which may
be temporary—indicative of local discharge of action,—or permanent—indicative of
injury of tissue.
