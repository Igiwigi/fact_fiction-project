Interestingly, this objective function depends only on the marginal densities of the estimated 1S
independent components w/ 2(£). This is quite advantageous because it means we do not 13
need to estimate any dependencies between the components, which would be computationally : S
very complicated. :@

Another interesting feature of the objective function in (2.6) is that each term }°, Gi(w} 2(t))
can be interpreted as a measure of non-Gaussianity of the estimated component w/z. In fact, this
is an estimate of the negative differential entropy of the components, and differential entropy can
be shown to be maximized for a Gaussian variable (for fixed variance). Thus, ICA estimation is
essentially performed by finding uncorrelated components that maximize non-Gaussianity (see
Hyvarinen & Oja [2] and Hyvarinen et al. [3] for more details). Such objective functions are then optimized by a suitable optimization method, the most
popular ones being FastICA [11] and natural gradient methods [12].
