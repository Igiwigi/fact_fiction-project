It can be easily shown that system (3.5) possesses two integrals of motion. The
first integral reads

Ierol? + |e2o|? = N?. (3.6)

Using (3.6), it is convenient to introduce angular coordinates:

¢10(t2) = N cos @(t2) exp(id1 (t2)) 7)
and ¢29(t2) = N sin © (12) exp(id2(t)). :
Angular representation of (3.7) allows for the reduction to the following planar system:

A
fou (-1)" cos
2NV1+sin Asin20 (3.8)
-1)" 20 sinA ,
and sin2@ A’ =20N? sin2@ cos20 — Cy ——) ,
N \V1+sinAsin20

where o = 3aN°/16, A = 51 — 59. It can be also shown that system (3.8) possesses an additional
integral of motion,

H=o(cos*@ + sin*@) + (-1)"V1+ sin20 sin A. (3.9)

In fact, system (3.8) depicts the slow evolution on the plane for stable and unstable branches
of SIM. Further study of the system dynamics will be fully concentrated on the non-stationary
regimes of (3.8) for both cases, i.e. 11—even, odd. In figure 2(a,b), we illustrate the series of phase
portraits of (3.8) for two distinct values of m, namely 1 =0 and m=1, respectively.
