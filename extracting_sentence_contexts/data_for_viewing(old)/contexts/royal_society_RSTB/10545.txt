Gomez & Gerken [2]. Although the two laboratories investigated different
aspects of SL, sequential probabilities as a source of information for extracting
words from running speech in the first case, and extraction and generalization
of frequent sequential patterns in an artificial grammar or artificial grammar

now many such presentations at the BUCLD and many
important publications of SL in children and adults.

Yet, the rapid SL observed in laboratory studies stands in
