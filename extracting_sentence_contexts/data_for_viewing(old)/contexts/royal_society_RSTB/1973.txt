the latter and that of the process a well-marked line of junction, which ran almost
transversely, was visible. This contrast was due to the smaller size and slightly
different contents of the sporophyte tissue.


OF SPORANGIA UPON FERN PROTHALLI. 209

The condition of things above described existed in this culture in August, 1896.
When it was again examined five months later the appearance presented was wholly
different. Most of the prothalli had an embryo attached to the under surface, and
these and the young plants in the culture were all of normal structure and mode of
origin. No further apogamous developments had occurred. The change in the
behaviour of the prothalli was explained by the fact that, previous to August, 1896,
the culture had not been watered from above. To this the large size of the prothalli
and the cases of apogamy stood in direct relation, Shortly after the date mentioned
the prothalli were regularly watered: as a result fertilisation ensued, and the
development of the young plants checked the growth of the prothalli and their
tendency to the apogamous production of buds.

The three varieties, coronatwm, cruciato-cristatum and percristatum, of this species
were sown. Normal embryos were borne on a large number of the prothalli, an
occurrence which reduced the number subjected to long cultivation, and accounts for
the comparatively few examples of apogamy. Those prothalli which had remained
