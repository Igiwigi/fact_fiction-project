In addition, where spacers targeted
MGEs that carry ABR, a concurrent reduction in ABR genes
was seen. These results have promising implications for the
delivery of novel technologies to combat ABR such as
phage therapy and CRISPR-Cas antimicrobials, which rely
on bypassing bacterial immune systems to kill cells. In fact,
they may be ideal for this purpose, if the most multidrug-
resistant strains are also the most immunocompromised. Data accessibility. The Snakemake pipeline used to calculate genome
lengths and detect CRISPR-Cas systems, ABR genes, intl1, ICEs

evidence strongly suggests CRISPR-Cas is an important and plasmid replicons, as well as R scripts used for producing
barrier to vectors of ABR, thereby blocking the acquisition trees and statistical analysis for this work are available at https://
of ABR genes themselves.
