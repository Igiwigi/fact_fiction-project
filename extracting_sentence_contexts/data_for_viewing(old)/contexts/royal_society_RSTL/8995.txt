Now suppose the charge exploded in the chamber to be increased. In this case, not
only is the density of the permanent gases increased on account of a larger quantity being
generated, but the density is still further added to, from the gases being confined in a
smaller space; the liquid residue CD H G being increased in a like proportion with the
