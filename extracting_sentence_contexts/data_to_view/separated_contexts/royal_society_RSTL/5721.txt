Within twenty-three seconds of this time the trough was again
filled with cold water: now, however, the epithelium was in many parts beginning to
exfoliate, swelling up by endosmose in obedience to the ordinary laws of chemical
affinity, and 0 indicating that it was losing its vitality. T also lost sight of the precise
8pot which I had been observing, but noticed that ciliary action was again going on pretty
quickly in some places. There can be no doubt, although there was no opportunity for
observing the fact, that the first immersion in hot water caused cessation of the ciliary
action; and that being admitted, we have in this case suspension of function and recovery
four times repeated in the same fragment of tissue in consequence of as many applications
and withdrawals of the irritant. It is a curious cireumstance that each recovery, except
the final one, brought up the action of the cilia for a time to a better state than they
had just before the last introduction of warm water. But the discussion of this and
other circumstances in this case will be best reserved till after the mention of another
et of experiments.
