accuracy profiles has never been applied. For the furocoumarins, the initial LC-MS/MS method
published in 2004 [67] was reworked by IFRA by using LC-QQQ and was a fully validated
approach (figure 6), but was not published. A variant based on HPLC-exact mass MS also meets
the present recommendations [68].

5. Conclusion

The development of a quantification method should combine good MS quantification practices
with appropriate validation. Both parts form a whole to ensure reliable results. Whatever the
sophistication of the analytical technique and the quality of the resulting validation, however,
the measurements only deliver a given probability of being within a given concentration interval.
This means that one can never be sure whether some results fall outside the acceptance level: only
a majority of them will fall within these limits. From a regulatory viewpoint, this is not a fact that
is clearly understood by all routine users of methods and, furthermore, by legislators.

The present article illustrates how fast the quantitative use of MS hyphenated to
chromatography has evolved over the past 15 years, leading to good new quantification practices,
largely inspired from the work conducted by the pharmaceutical industry. There is no doubt
that these practices will continue to be improved to face the increasing complexity of regulatory
constraints in the F&F domain.
