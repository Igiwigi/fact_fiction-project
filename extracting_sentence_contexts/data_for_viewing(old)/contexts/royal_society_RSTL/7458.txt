S The portion of the work which was assigned to me was the connexion of the triangu-

S in France, they not only consented to allow this, but at the same time yolunteered to

join in the labour and expense of the work itself.

It would obyiously have been wrong to mix up observations made with different kinds
of instruments and on different principles, and therefore it was agreed that the work
Should, in fact, be made in duplicate, both the French and English geometricians using
the exact same stations.

The results obtained by the French geometricians is published in the Supplement to
vol. ix. of the © Memorial du Depot General de la Guerre,” 1865, and the agreement
with the results obtained by the English is truly surprising.

But however accurately the trigonometrical observations might be performed, it is
obvious that, without a precise knowledge of the relative lengths of the standards used
