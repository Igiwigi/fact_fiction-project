or we now have capacity expressed as an integral of (@) and measurable in micro-.
farads, and it appears that the capacity is a function of the time of charge increasing
as the time increases. Experiments have been made for testing this point in

the case of light flint glass, showing that the capacity was the same for 1/20000
second and for ordinary durations of time (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ 1881, p. 356), doubtless

because {. ; wW(@) do is small compared with pam Vi(w)da. Now | w (w) dw, when ¢

is indefinitely diminished, may be zero, have a finite value, or be infinite ; in fact it

has a finite value. The value of y(@) when @ is extremely small can hardly be
observed ; but [.¥(e) dw, when ¢ is small, can be observed. It is therefore con-
venient to treat that part of the expression separately, even though we may
conceive it to be quite coutinuous with the other parts of the expression. {, ws (w) do,

when ¢ is less than the shortest, time at which we can make observations of  (),
is the instantaneous capacity of the condenser. Call it K and suppose the form of

yw to be so modified that for all observed times it has the observed values, but 80
that [. (o) do = 0, when ¢ is small enough.
Then y, = Ka, + Fae {us (o) + 8}do. Here the first term represents capacity,
