However, STOCH_UNCPL
shows a clear increase in Arctic sea ice volume when compared to REF (figure 1, (i)). The first 20-—
30 years can be seen as a transient phase during which Arctic sea ice volume builds up slowly. It is
worth pointing out that the year-to-year increase in the sea ice volume is rather small during the
transient phase; the fact that the quasi-equilibrium response in the Arctic owing to the stochastic
sea ice scheme amounts to 10-20% after the first three decades of the integration can be explained
through accumulation.

Figure 1. (a) Northern Hemisphere total (i) sea ice volume (103 km?) and (ii) sea ice area (10° km?) for REF (red), STOCH_CPL
(blue) and STOCH_UNCPL (green); results are shown for March (upper curves) and September (lower curves). (b) Monthly mean
difference in Northern Hemisphere (i) sea ice volume (10° km’) and (ii) sea ice area (10° km’) between STOCH_CPLand REF (blue)
as well as STOCH_UNCPL and REF (green). Coloured horizontal lines show respective mean values. 95% confidence intervals—
using a t-test with consideration of the reduction of effective sample size owing to a lag-1 autocorrelation [44]—are given as
vertical bars.
