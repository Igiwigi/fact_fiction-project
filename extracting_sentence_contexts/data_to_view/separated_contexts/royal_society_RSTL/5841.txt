It is an
irregularly looped organ, destitute of a vascular tuft, and wnciliated. In another parti-
cular it is remarkable: the ova in the female are retained within the proper limits of
the membranous walls of the organ itself, after the type of the ovarian segmental organs
of the Hirudinei. This fact the author has proved repeatedly by direct observation ;
but it may also be established negatively. The branchize are capacious hollow processes,
communicating in the most open manner with the perigastric-cavity. The fluid of the
latter circulates freely in the former.
