A very important supposition has to be made, however, before either of these methods
can be applied. That is, that the true focus is either at the surface or so near the surface
that a small correction can be made for it. If, however, the focus is at a considerable

and unknown depth both methods fail, as is obvious from the consideration that, since
all the rays we can observe must have passed out from the focus, we have no data for
the comparatively large range of distance AB on the surface for which brachistochronic
rays would not penetrate as deep as does the observed seismic ray. In fact, another
unknown element enters into the connexion between the observed time curve and the
variation of speed with depth.

A finite depth of focus implies a minimum angle of emergence at some point on the
earth’s surface and a point of inflexion on the time curve, and vice versa. Now, in
considering ZépprRitz’s accepted time curve for P, we recognize that up to 4 = 1000 km.
the curve is probably hypothetical, but from 1000 km. to 13,000 km. there is no indication
of a point of inflexion. It is not until we come to consider Gaxrrzin’s direct measure-
ments of the angle of emergence that we are confronted with a most marked minimum
angle of emergence near 4 = 4000 km., implying a point of inflexion on the time curve
and a very considerable depth of focus. As Ga.irzqn’s observations form the whole
basis of this paper, they are reproduced here (although published elsewhere), as the
