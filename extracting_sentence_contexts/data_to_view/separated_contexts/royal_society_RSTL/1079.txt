Baron Supported the idea of the probability of
alumine being a metallic substance, see Annales de Chemie, vol. x. p. 257,--Lavors12n
extended these notions, by supposing the other earths metallic oxides, Elements, 24
edit, KerR's translation, p. 217. The general enquiry was closed by the assertion of
Toxp1 and Ruvsccar, that the earths might be reduced by charcoal ; and the accu-
rate researches of KLayRoOTH and SavaREs1, who proved by the most decisive ex-
periments, that the metals taken for the bases of the earths were phosphurets of iron,
obtained from the bone ashes and other materials employed in the experiment, Annales
de Chemie, vol. viii p. 18, and vol. x. p. 257, 275. Amidst all these hypotheses, potash
and soda were never considered as metallic in their nature; LavoisteR supposed them
to contain azote ; nor at that time were there any analogies to lead that acute phila-
50pher to a happier conjecture.


the Decomposition of the Farths, &c. 335

I delayed for some time laying an account of many of the
principal results which I obtained before the Society, in the
hopes of being able to render them more distinct and satisfac-
tory; but finding that for this end a more powerful battery,
and more perfect apparatus than I have a prospect of seeing
very 800n constructed, will be required, I have ventured to
bring forwards the investigation in its present imperfect state ;
and I shall prefer the imputation of having published unfinished
labours, to that of having concealed any new facts from the
scientific world, which may tend to assist the progress of che-
mical knowledge.

2. Methods employed for decomposing the alkaline Earths. Barytes, strontites, and lime, slightly moistened, were elec-
trified by iron wires under naphtha, by the same methods, and
with the same powers as those employed for the decompo-
sition * of the fixed alkalies.
