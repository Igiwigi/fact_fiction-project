geological facts regarding the nature of the catastrophe. From Dr. C. W. Braxcu,
Dr. Dunpar Hueues, and Dr. Austin, of St. Vincent, and from Major Wits,
R.A.M.C., and Dr. Hursoy, of Barbados, we obtained most of the information on

many survivors who had passed the afternoon and night of May 7th in the Carib
Country.
