flows. Since then, the explosion of computational methods and tools in fluid mechanics seems
to have rendered analytical methods and the key role of modelling almost redundant, but an
analytical path [40,41] based on Rivlin’s approach surely needs reviving.

The connection between non-Newtonian fluids and turbulent flows has generated a long
discussion with origins tracing back to the early papers of Rivlin in 1947. However, even
the more recent nonlinearly dispersive Navier-Stokes-alpha (NS-a) model of incompressible
fluid turbulence (also called the viscous Camassa—Holm equations) makes a link [42] with the
second-grade fluid theory of Rivlin and co-workers.

The starting point of secondary flow studies is a paper by Fosdick et al. [43], showing that
secondary flows are necessary in general situations for fluids. A parallel effort can be found in
elasticity [44] and in turbulent flows [45]. In fact, secondary motions are more ubiquitous than was
envisaged. The semi-inverse method championed by Rivlin to find analytical solutions to the field
equations of continuum mechanics gives rise to many compatibility problems and opens the door
to many perturbative schemes connected with the appearance of the secondary deformations or
motions.

Here, Gomez-Constante & Rajagopal [46] study the flow of a certain type of non-Newtonian
fluids in tubes of elliptic and other non-circular cross-sections. They set out to determine the
velocity field and the stresses generated at the tube’s boundary. They also provide a critical
appraisal of Rivlin’s work in this area.
