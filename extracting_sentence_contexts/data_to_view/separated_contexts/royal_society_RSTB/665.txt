Finally, i
the Mammalian salivary gland, there would appear to be a definite connection between
the nature of the nerve fibres stimulated and that of the electrical change. In experiments upon excitation of the skin of the Eel it is unfortunately impossible —
to make use of indirect stimulation by cutaneous nerves. ‘This fact is occasioned by
the absence of a large subcutaneous lymph space, such as exists in the case of the
Frog and Toad, so that a ‘‘ nerve-skin preparation” is not feasible. It is, therefore,
necessary to resort to direct stimulation, which may be electrical, thermic, or
mechanical, In the circuit represented in fig.
