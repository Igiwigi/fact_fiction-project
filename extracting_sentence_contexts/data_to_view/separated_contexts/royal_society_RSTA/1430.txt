For example, few in the
community seem aware that key elements of FOSS emerged in a culture of openness and collective
effort, in keeping with long-established academic principles of knowledge-sharing. Fewer still
seem to realize that FOSS provides the technical backbone of the infrastructure that enables their
effortless access to literature, data, and software (e.g. high-speed networks, responsive search
engines). In fact, today there is often even confusion among researchers as to what FOSS actually is. A case in point is the common interpretation of ‘open source’ as ‘open code’—that is, software
for which the human-readable form of the code, or source code, is openly available, with
unrestricted access by all. Misled perhaps by similarity in the name (think, for example, of open
access in academic publishing), advocates of open science have turned their attention to the
software that generates findings reported in scientific papers.
