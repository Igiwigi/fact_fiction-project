Indeed,
the non-adiabatic couplings that are neglected in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation can
become arbitrarily large close to a CI [2-4] and break the Bornâ€”-Oppenheimer approximation. In this case, one may believe that including the missing couplings should be sufficient to recover
the exact description, but this is not completely true. A first difficulty comes from the fact that the
non-adiabatic couplings diverge at the CIs. Hence, all the non-adiabatic coupling terms may not
be integrable over the chosen basis and can lead to numerical instabilities. Another difficulty is
that an extra geometric phase (GP) attached to the adiabatic states appears upon encircling the
Cls [5-8].
