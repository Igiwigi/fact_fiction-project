could account for the fact that many parasites can infect more by host-parasite associations: in a host-parasite network with

sites. ParaFitGlobal computes a ‘fourth corner’ statistic [24] that interact mainly with one another, and not with other clusters
based on the product of matrices describing (i) the presence/ of hosts and parasites. Modules are computed using the cluster_
absence of each host-parasite association; (ii) the parasite phylo- walktrap function in the R package igraph [37].
