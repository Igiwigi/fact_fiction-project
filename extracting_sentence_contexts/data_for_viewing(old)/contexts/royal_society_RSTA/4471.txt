above, this means finding four jointly distributed random variables (A,B, X,Y) such that, in
reference to (1.1),

(A,B)~ RO and (X,Y) ~ RT), (1.2)

~ standing for ‘is distributed as’. The quadruple (A,B,X,Y) is then called a coupling for the
bunches R'94) and R41), The ‘well-chosen constraints’ is a key notion in the formulation above.
In our example, these constraints should apply to A and X, the coupling counterparts of Ra
and Roa ) measuring (answering) the same question q in two different contexts.

Intuitively, ‘non-contextuality’ means ‘independence of context’, and because of this it is
tempting to say that the system of two bunches in (1.1) is non-contextual if we can consider Ra
and Ro ) as ‘one and the same’ random variable, Rj. This may appear simple, but in fact it is

logically impossible: since Rw and Rw are stochastically unrelated, they cannot be ‘the same’.

A random variable cannot be stochastically unrelated to itself. The precise meaning here comes
from considering couplings (A,B, X, Y) for the two bunches. Clearly, in every such coupling A ~

RWA ) and X~ ROA )_ We can say that the measurement of q in the system is context-independent


if among all possible couplings (A,B, X,Y) there is at least one in which Pr[A # X] = 0. In this
particular example, due to its simplicity (only three random variables involved in two contexts), it
can be shown that such a coupling does exist, provided RvA yn Rv ” tna more complex system,
