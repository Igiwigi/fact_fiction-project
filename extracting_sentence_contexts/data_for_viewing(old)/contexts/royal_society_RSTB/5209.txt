which he studied.

The nature and homologies of the hyomandibular cartilage in the different groups
of fishes has been for many years the subject of much investigation, and one about
which there is a great difference of opinion. The question of its homologies has been
discussed at great length by ALLIs (1915, 1918), and has also been dealt with recently
by ScHMALHAUSEN (1923) and Dr Brrr (19245).

Commencing with the Selachians, there is little doubt that the hyomandibular of the
Sharks (Pleurotremata) represents the epal element of the hyoid arch. This conclusion,
which is based on a number of facts concerning the relations of the hyomandibular to
the neurocranium, and to the associated muscles, nerves and blood-vessels, is further
supported by the fact that an independent pharyngohyal cartilage has been observed in
the embryonic or adult stages of Stegostoma, Galeus, Mustelus and other genera (LUTHER,
1909, p. 18*; Sewerrzorr, 1923). ALLis (1915), while he agrees with this conclusion,
regards the hyomandibular of the Rays (Hypotremata) as the pharyngeal element.
These fishes, however, present a number of features which show that they are clearly
modified and specialized Sharks, and it is scarcely conceivable that the articulation of
the hyoid arch with the cranium should be through a different element in the two groups.
Further, the presence of a rudimentary pharyngohyal in Trygon and Torpedo
(SrwEerTzorF, 1923) suggests that in the Rays the hyomandibular is also the epal element,
and is strictly homologous with the hyomandibular of the Sharks.

The presence of an independent pharyngohyal in Chimera (Srwerrzorr, 1923) and
Callorhynchus (SCHAUINSLAND, 1903) makes it clear that the hyomandibular is a true
