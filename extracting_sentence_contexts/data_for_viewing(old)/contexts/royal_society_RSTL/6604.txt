The above equations are somewhat more general than those given by LrouvILam in
his Journal of 1858, and are, as we haye just seen, at once obtained by applying the
fundamental formulze of section 36. ;

moving about a fixed point without assuming the principle of virtual velocities, and is in
fact a very simple deduction from D'ALEMBERT'S principle. + Ss

Let O# be the instantaneous axis, about which the body is rotating n
at time # with an angular velocity s. Let be a particle of the body, |= -
let its mass be m, its distance from O 7, r, and its velocity v in the
direction 17.

Suppose now a force P to act at m. Then, since mn is perpendicular on the plane
Om, it is clear from statics that the moment of P about O# is the moment of the
resolyed part of P along mn. Tt is therefore, if @ be the angle which the direction of P

makes with 1.7, equal to 7P cos ©, or Z P cos ©.
Suppose then P to be the moving force of the particle m. Then its resolved part
