Mathematically, the technique required for this treatment is very similar to that intro-
duced by Sommerfeld (1897) in his classic discussion of the diffraction of electromagnetic
waves at a semi-infinite perfectly conducting obstacle, and later simplified and developed
by various authors, including Lamb and Carslaw. In particular, our method of the succes-
sive introduction of new waves at D, F, etc., is very similar to the approximate method
employed by Schwarzschild (1902) for the solution of the problem of diffraction at a slit of
monochromatic electromagnetic radiation. In fact, the method is much better adapted for
our problem than for Schwarzschild’s, for in his case the complete infinite series was required
for a solution, and its convergence is sometimes slow, whereas in our case each term of the
series gives an exact solution for an aerofoil with chord extended by a further distance. In this discussion of these problems it may aid description if one of the more picturesque
physical analogies is considered in parallel with the aerofoil problem. For this purpose
the long-wave case is chosen—the analogous problem being the discussion of the wave system
produced by a semi-infinite plank moved normal to itself in a shallow sheet of water.
