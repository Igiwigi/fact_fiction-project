Judging from the large size of the paraseptal
g cartilages in Monotremes, Marsupials, and Insectivora, this region was well developed
3 sin ancestral mammals. 3 This view of the mode of development of the mammalian vomer is supported by

a the fact that in Echidna and Mus (Gaver) and the Guinea-pig (PARKER) the
a mammalian vomer is developed as a paired bone. The alternative view of the homology of the mammalian vomer is that of
Bianp-Surron as developed by Broom. According to this theory the mammalian
yomer is not homologous with the prevomers of reptiles, but is developed from the
reptilian parasphenoid, J

Tn specimen 8 of Ornithorhynchus the paraseptal cartilages are well developed, as
shown in the model which Prof. Wrrtson has already described.
