The aforementioned will suffice to show that irreversibility of a mechanical work has intimate
connections with processes happening at finite speed. The surprising result of this paper is that
the amount of mechanical work we loose irreversibly per single degree of freedom, i.e. AWjrrev,
within the time period t satisfies the following time-energy uncertainty relation

AWirreyT 2 Mprocess- (1.1)

The total work lost irreversibly would then be AWirrey = Nf AWirrey, where N is the number of
particles and f the number of particle degrees of freedom, and Mprocess > 0 is a process-dependent
constant that has the dimension of an action. The value of the constant Itprocess depends on the
physical scale of the process. As will be shown, Nprocess is essentially bounded from below by
Planckâ€™s constant, which makes a surprising parallel to the Heisenberg time-energy uncertainty
relation, despite the fact that both uncertainty relations have very different conceptual origins. It
should perhaps be noted that in our reasoning we do not use any quantum mechanical but purely
classical mechanical considerations.

Aforementioned uncertainty relation allows one to regain an intuition that seems to have
vanished from classical equilibrium thermodynamics. Loosely speaking equation (1.1) can be
interpreted as follows: to run a process faster we inevitably loose more energy irreversibly,
meaning that we cannot recover this energy by running the process in reversed direction.
Consequently, faster-turning heat engines become less efficient. So, to perform work faster makes
it inevitably less efficient. One particularly important implication for heat engines that follows
from equation (1.1) is the existence of an upper bound for its rate of change, the so-called idle
speed, which is reached when the process runs so fast that its efficiency becomes zero.
