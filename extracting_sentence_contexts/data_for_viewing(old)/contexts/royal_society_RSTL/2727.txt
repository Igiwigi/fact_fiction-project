and presented to it ; and the means of supply, namely, the power of the heart and
arteries, as well as that of the capillary yessels themselves, being, as we have seen,
under the immediate influence of the same power which effects the chemical changes+,
the supply is proportioned to the demand under the various conditions of the ever-
changing functions ; and under the same influence are the means of removal, whether
of secreted fluids or solid parts become unfit for the purposes of life. Such are the
cireumstances above referred to, which render it necessary that the muscles, whether
directly or indirectly, employed in these functions should be subjected to the same
power on which depend the functions of secretion and assimilation, namely, all muscles
of involuntary propulsion, that is, with a very few exceptions, all muscles of inyo-
luntary motion.

It appears from some lately ascertained facts that the secreted fluids are formed
from the blood while still in its vessels, and not in the act of their separation by the
secreting organs, That such must necessarily be the case appears from what has been
said. The act of separation must be posterior to the changes effected by the chemical
powers of the neryous influence. Tt is only while the blood is $till in its vessels that
it can be exposed to their operation ; and we have reason to believe that it is only as
the due changes have been effected, that is, only as the secreted fluid has acquired
its due properties, that it applies the due stimulus to the vessels by which it is dis-
charged: on the same principle that the due action of the intestines, by which they
discharge their contents, is not excited if these contents have not acquired their due
properties by the chemical processes which take place in the stomach and duodenum.

Such are the nature and functions of the nervous power, and its relations to the
