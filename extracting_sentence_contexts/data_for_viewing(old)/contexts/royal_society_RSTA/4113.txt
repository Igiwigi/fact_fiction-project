been used. The principle of biological hierarchically structured superhydrophobic and anti-
adhesive surfaces was first described in 1977 for a system of usually two to three ‘superimposed
sculptural levels’ to reach mechanically stable extreme non-wettability, and low adhesion for self-
cleaning abilities [8] and for drag reduction [15,25,26]. The self-cleaning, later called the ‘lotus
effect’ [10,11], was discovered in the leaves of Indian cress (Tropaeolum), cabbage (Brassica), reed
(Phragmites) and others. Lotus leaves (Nelumbo) were only analysed after 1985; they are still
considered to be the ultimate biological role model [27,28].

The publication on The purity of sacred lotus [11] was rejected for publication by five renowned
journals; the reviewers were not ready for a change in paradigms in surface technologies. In
2016, the lotus effect (Barthlott and Neinhuis [11]) had gained almost 4000 citations according
to Google Scholar (compare figure 7). Indian and Chinese co-workers and students drew
our attention to the fact that the remarkable properties of the lotus were mentioned in the
ancient texts of the Bhagavad-Gita and in Chinese writings. The properties of the lotus were
traditional knowledge in Hinduism and Buddhism; in contrast, there was a complete omission
the general western knowledge at the time. The usage of the term ‘lotus effect’, closely followed
by ‘superhydrophobic’, shows the remarkable increase (figure 7) starting in 1990, based on the
data supplied by the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI). A general search machine such as
‘Google’ provides (May 2016) around 600000 hits for ‘lotus effect’ and about 520000 hits for
‘superhydrophobic’.
