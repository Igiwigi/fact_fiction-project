ON THE THICKNESS AND SURFACE TENSION OF LIQUID FILMS, 629

eir surface tensions were identical, the curvature of each would be the same. Van
per MENSBRUGGHE, however, considers that a zone of liquid in the upper bubble
- would in descending increase its gurface, while in the lower bubble the surface of the
* descending mass would diminish. Hence the upper bubble would become cooled,
while the temperature of the lower one would be raised, and this would be indicated
by a difference of curvature, due to the fact that the surface tensions were not the
ame. Observation showed that snch a difference of curvature existed. In one
experiment the sagittz of the spherical segments differed by 1:15 mm., which
diminished after 45‚Äù to 0'1 mm.
