S the N being equivalent to the H,, which appears simultaneously at the negative
& electrode.

No reduction of the nitrate to a less oxidized alt takes place at the negative elec-
trode. This is a fact of so0me interest, because it is opposed to the hypothesis that a
nascent body possesses a chemical activity not belonging to it in its ordinary free con-
dition ; for here is. basylous hydrogen, at the -moment of its liberation, exerting no
action on the nitrate, although zinc and other metals x0 readily reduce it under various

conditions, including that of its solution in ammonia®.

* Ammonium amalgam als» appears to have during its decomposition no reducing action upon a nitrate,
a fact, however, which may be due to the amalgam not being really a compound of ammonium.



376 ON THE UNION OF AMMONIA NITRATE WITH AMMONIA /

When the positive electrode is formed of platinum, or iron, it is unacted upon during
the electrolysis; but when it is formed of 8#lver, mercury, lead, copper, zinc, or mag-
nesium, it is corroded, and no nitrogen is evolved. The silver, lead, and copper elec-
trodes readily dissolve as nitrates, the copper one s00n becoming coated with an azure-
blue deposit. Mercury dissolves only slightly, but its surface becomes covered with a
grey deposit. Zine and magnesium dissolve as nitrates, but somewhat more slowly
than the other metals mentioned, a fact probably to be accounted for by their tendency
