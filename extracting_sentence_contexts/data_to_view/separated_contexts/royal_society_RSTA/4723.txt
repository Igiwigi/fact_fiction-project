In [8], it was shown that there is a distinguished family of subpresheaves (the presheaf
analogues of subsets of a set) of the spectral presheaf 2, called clopen subobjects.? These
subobjects form a complete Heyting algebra Sub,|Z, and there is a systematic way, called
daseinization, of mapping propositions about the physical world to clopen subobjects. The
fact that we arrive at a Heyting algebra rather than at a Boolean algebra signifies the shift
from classical, two-valued Boolean logic to a form of intuitionistic logic, which turns out
to be multi-valued. The logical aspects of the topos formalism for quantum theory arise

2A subobject $ of ¥ is called clopen if every component $y, V € V(N), is a clopen subset of Dy.


from the internal logic of the topos of presheaves over the context category; for details
see [8,13,14,16,18]. We will not be concerned with this part of the theory here.

— When representing pure states, a difference between classical physics and quantum
physics in the topos formulation shows up.
