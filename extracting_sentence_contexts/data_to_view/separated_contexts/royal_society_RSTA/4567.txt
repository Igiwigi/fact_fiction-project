Thus, while it is exceedingly improbable that the
mean values of 8, and f, differ much from their observed values, it is very possible
that the true mean value of the criterion is zero and not — 0°04495.* The compara-
tively large and opposite values of the criterion at Markree Castle and Stonyhurst
must, of course, be duly regarded, and a longer series of observations at these two
stations may some day serve to indicate how far their barometric conditions are
peculiar to local conditions of climate or of observation. As a matter of fact, the curves corresponding to equations (iv.) or (v.) above were
originally calculated for all the stations, and drawn upon the diagrams as well as those
corresponding to (ii.), but the mean percentage error in frequency, when tested by a
planimeter, showed no very sensible improvement. An examination of Plates 9-17,
giving the graphical representationt of the observed frequency by the theoretical
distribution (the negative direction of # being towards high barometer)

Y = Y (1 + w/a)? e™,

amply demonstrates that this limit to the skew binomial suffices to satisfactorily
describe barometric frequency.
