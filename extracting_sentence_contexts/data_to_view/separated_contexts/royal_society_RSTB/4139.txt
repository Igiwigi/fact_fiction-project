From their figure it is clear that this case of
division has nothing to do with B. caudatus, because each of the daughter-individuals
is uninucleate and shows no sign of the binucleate condition, and if one thing is
certain, it is that in all binucleates the division of the kinetonucleus and of the
trophonucleus is quite independent, and each of these organelle is always present, as
such, from the start, in any newly-formed individual. I do not consider that
multiple division, inside a cyst, occurs in the true binucleate Bodos. The most important fact about B. caudatus, from the point of view of this paper,
is that, so far as can be ascertained, no process of syngamy occurs in its life-cycle. I
have carefully studied thriving cultures of this form in observation-preparations at
ditferent periods, both towards the end of the cycle, when cyst-formation is beginning
to occur and numerous individuals are seen which have ceased to displace themselves
and have become sluggish and are about to commence encystment, and also at the
beginning of the cycle, when numbers of individuals have been recently liberated from
their cysts. In no case have I ever been able to find any double individuals, 7e.,
with duplicated flagella or any other indication whatever of syngamy.
