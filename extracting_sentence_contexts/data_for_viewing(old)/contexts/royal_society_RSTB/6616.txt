I have not seen a satisfactory display of the outer surface of the jaw so that I cannot

say with certainty whether or no its lower margin was turned outward in the
manner commonly found in Elasmobranch Meckel’s cartilage, but I do not think that
it was.

The palato-quadrate bones of the disarticulated skeleton are perfectly preserved and
fortunately display both inner and outer surfaces. This bone is much shorter than the
lower jaw, an indication that the palato-quadrate, like Meckel’s cartilage, was
ossified from more than one centre. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that the
part of the palato-quadrate preserved corresponds quite accurately in length to the
posterior portion of the lower jaw. The palato-quadrate bone so far as it is shown
consists of a very deep post-orbital ramus formed of a thin film of bone which stood
vertically in the whole skull, and an exceedingly short abruptly truncated palatal portion
lying quite horizontally and very thin dorso-ventrally. The posterior part of the bone to-
ward its anterior end bears at its lower margin a ridge projecting labially which is the
palatal ramus, this subsides on to the outer surface of the ventral plate so as to leave space
for masticatory muscles. The hinder margin of the bone turns out, the lower border of
the everted portion being thickened to form the quadrate articular surface. From the
quadrate forward the upper part of the bone forms part of a circle until it ends at a
nearly vertical but somewhat irregular anterior border, which passes down to the
palatal part of the bone. The tooth-bearing border of the palato-quadrate forms a
