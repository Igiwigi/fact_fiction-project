which produces both viscous drag due to the Newtonian wall stress and form drag due to the
pressure distribution, acting as sinks of momentum.

1We do not follow the fashion of referring to Onsager’s result on energy conservation for Hélder exponent h > 1/3 as the
‘Onsager conjecture’, and we shall instead refer to it as the ‘Onsager theorem’. Onsager did not state this result in his
published 1949 paper [5] as a conjecture, but instead he claimed that ‘it is possible to show that’ and he had, in fact, the
outlines of a rigorous proof [6,7]. The idea further suggested by Onsager [5] that energy should be dissipated for some Euler
solutions with Hélder exponent h < 1/3 is, however, legitimately referred to as the ‘Onsager conjecture’. For a review of the
important recent progress on that latter problem by ‘convex integration’ methods, see [8,9].


In addition, however, a spatial cascade is required which transfers momentum via ideal
nonlinear interactions through an ‘inertial sublayer’ in order to maintain the necessary supply
from the flow interior, in close analogy with the cascade of kinetic energy through the ‘inertial
subrange’ in fluid turbulence away from walls [17]. The aim of the present short paper is to
discuss this momentum cascade in wall-bounded turbulence using the same methods which
have been previously applied to analyse anomalous dissipation of kinetic energy in such wall-
bounded flows [1-4]. To be concrete, we shall consider the specific example of pressure-driven
