exceeding 002, resembling, in this respect, some vessels which are scattered through
the medullary parenchyma. On examining the longitudinal section (fig. 14) of this
axial cylinder, we find that the vessels are of the usual barred type, and that the largest
of them occupy the central parts of each cluster—a fact als shown by fig. 13. But
the most remarkable feature of these vessels is further illustrated by figs. 15 & 16. In
fig. 15 the dark, strongly marked walls of the vessels enclose densely packed masses of
cells (7). The longitudinal section, made nearly through the centre of a single vessel
(fig. 16), shows it to be similarly crowded with 7ylose throughout its entire length.
The existence of this singular tissne in the vessels of recent plants has long been
known to botanists, and Professor W. 'T. TnisLEToN Dyer has described a similar tissue
existing in a fossil Tertiary exogenous wood from Herne Bay and the Isle of ThanetF;
but $0 far as I am aware this is the first recorded example of its appearance in a fossil
Cryptogam, and especially in one from these ancient Carboniferous deposits. The fact
of the existence of Zylose at this remote period affords a striking example of the
persistence of types of elementary tissne, additional to those which we already possess.

Bundle-sheath.—The axial vascular cylinder is enclosed in a somewhat irregular
sheath of cellular tissue seen at figs. 13, 9 & 14, 9. This consists of three or four rows
