The experiments are quite striking. These are the experiments they
did in iron-silicon alloys, in which they measured stress-strain curves
with and without hydrogen. The postulate that the damage was caused
by this superabundance of vacancies was demonstrated by the fact
that they could outgas the hydrogen from the specimen, and then see


the stress-strain curve would return to the hydrogen case, not to the
pure case. This was regarded as evidence that the hydrogen produces damage
and then, if you remove it from the specimen, you do not recover the
hydrogen-free mechanical properties. That's very startling and striking,
because it means hydrogen is not actually involved in the fracture
process or the damage process at all.
