Nothing is known of the early stages, and not much accurately of the histology of
the chorion, for of Orca, TURNER says, on p. 480, “not only had several days elapsed
after the death of the animal, but the chorion had soaked for some time in the warm
water during the process of injection,” and so he not unexpectedly failed to find any
epithelium in the villi. Although clearly in the later stages the cetacean placenta is of the plicate type,
still there is no evidence at present whether the trophoblast is ever heaped up or not. The fact of the presence of folds, and of villi forming parallel ridges, suggests a
folding tendency rather than a heaping, and no mention is made of any extravasated
blood lacunee,

202 MR. R. ASSHETON ON THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE UNGULATE PLACENTA, AND

Sirenia.—Turner’s description of the advanced stage of the dugong does not
suggest the occurrence of any heaping up. There are no lacunz of extravasated ~
blood, and the villi fit into crypts which are lined with an epithelium. In one-respect the dugong is unlike the majority of the plicate group in having
some much longer villi than others which appear to remain within the crypts at birth
and become absorbed.
