in the internal symmetry spaces such as the flavour or colour spaces.

Our focus is on self-sustained field theoretic states that have enhanced capacity of information-
storage. This implies that they can exist in a large number 1st of (nearly) degenerate microstates. In
such a case, a well-defined measure of the information storage capacity is the microstate entropy,
S=In(nst).

Generically, such a ‘device’ represents a macroscopic object with many elementary
constituents. We shall denote their number by N. Let the strength of the quantum coupling among
these constituents be w and the size of the object be R. For definiteness, we shall assume an
approximate spherical symmetry. Also, we shall ignore unimportant numerical factors.

The fact that the object is self-sustained implies that there is a certain balance among N and @ at
the scale R. If a characteristic wavelength of the constituents is R, the self-sustainability condition
reads

No =1. (1.1)

At large N, this is the case for many field theoretic object such as black holes, solitons or baryons.
In more general cases, there can exist several sorts of constituents with different couplings. The
bound formulated in terms of the Goldstone phenomenon is largely insensitive to this diversity.

In the limit of large N, the concept of spontaneous breaking is well defined. Correspondingly,
there exist gapless Goldstone modes. The decay constant of a Goldstone mode shall be denoted
by f. For a lump formed by N particles of wavelengths R, the decay constant of the Goldstone of
