Thus the forced tides for the law of depth in question will be
expressible by a finite series of terms terminating with a term involving P,. This general law does not hold when 7 = 2, owing to the presence of a term in the
right-hand member of the second equation. The fact that for these laws of depth the tide-heights could be expressed by finite
series, instead of by the infinite series usually required, was originally proved by
Laptace in the ‘ Mécanique Céleste.’*
