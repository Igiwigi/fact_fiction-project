Our investigations would lead us to a
far different eonclusion, nor can we, judging from our histological data, regard the
divisions mapped off from each other by fissures and primary sulci as other than
structurally distinct organs. In no case 1s this 80 palpable as in the various regions
of the great limbic lobe, for here both a superficial survey, 1.e., of the 8tructure of
the cortex and an investigation of the deep medullary connexions of these regions
conclusively confirm the statement now advanced. In the former memoir* I insisted
strongly upon the fact that certain sulei or fissures formed gharply-defined boundary

lines betwixt regions differing in the structure of their cortex : these were the crucial
and infra-parietal sulci, together with the fisxure of RoLaNDo. My later investigations
enable me till further to extend this lisb by others, viz.:
