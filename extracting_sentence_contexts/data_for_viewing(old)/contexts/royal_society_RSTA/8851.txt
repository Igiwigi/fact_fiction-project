produced by the eddy losses in the wires, and it is quite possible that the phase relations
may produce a rise in potential in phase with the current in part of a system. The
only condition that is essential is that the value of u, for the whole system shall be
positive. Curves A and B of fig. 6 (p. 79) show the distribution of proximity resistance
and of loss respectively for a 16-wire system.

(14) Single Layer Coils. Effect of radius of curvature of Coils.â€”A single layer circular
coil, whose width of winding is small compared with the radius of the coil, differs only
slightly from a straight parallel wire system, so that formula (53) will hold for a coil of
this kind as a first approximation. The slight differences which occur, due to helicity
of winding and owing to the fact that the wire (regarded as a cylinder under the
action of a transverse field) is curved, are probably too small to be measurable and
the mathematical difficulties too great to make a theoretical treatment possible.

A more important difference is the modification of the transverse field acting on the

individual wires. In a straight single layer system the field acting on one wire is per-
pendicular to the surface of the layer, but in a single layer coil not only is this normal
field modified but there also exists a component of the field acting along the surface of
the layer. The case where the number of wires in the coil is large will alone be
