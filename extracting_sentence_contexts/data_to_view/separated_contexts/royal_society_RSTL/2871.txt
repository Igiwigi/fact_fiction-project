Dr. BurmersTss, in his Manual,
recently translated by Mr. SHuckasD, has spoken of the temperature of insects, but
only of insects in society, and has referred to the observations of Jucn, ReauMuR,
&e., and although he believes in the existence of individual temperature in insects,
has given no observation of his own to prove the fact, while Dr. BerTHoLD, in the
work just noticed, (experiment 59,) made on a single insect, could not detect it, nor
could he do 80 in every species when the observation was made on a number of indi-
viduals collected together. It is evident, therefore, that although the existence of
individual temperature is inferred from experiments on insects collected together,
It yet remains to be proved that every individual insect in a state of activity invariably
maintains a certain amount of temperature, which is readily appreciable by the in-
struments we are enabled to employ.
