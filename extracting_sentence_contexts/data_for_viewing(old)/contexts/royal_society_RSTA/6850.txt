stability, also the relaxation technique which was based on that principle in Part VI
of this series (Pellew & Southwell 1940). For brevity, knowledge of Part VI will be

assumed here. Our purpose is to extend the same basic methods to systems of another
kind.

3. ‘Two classes of problems will be considered. The first relates to the elastic stability
of plane frameworks, consequently is concerned with systems of restricted freedom. The
second relates to the elastic stability of flat plating, i.e. of continuous systems.

Timoshenko (1936, §28) has given a number of references to investigations con-

cerned with the elastic stability of frameworks assumed to buckle in their own planes;*
but he exemplifies the problem of transverse buckling (i.e. out of the plane of the framework)
by one case only—the possible instability of the upper chord ofa low-truss bridge (§ 24) ;
and in this, to facilitate the calculations, he replaces the upper chord by a bar with
hinged ends which is compressed by forces distributed along its length, and the elastic
supports at intermediate (panel) points by an equivalent (continuous) elastic founda-
tion.t Using standard formulae for frameworks (Southwell 1940, Chaps. m and
Iv), it is now possible to treat frameworks whether plane or three-dimensional,} and
