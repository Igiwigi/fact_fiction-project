In the whale tribe, they are not properly fins, (although
they cannot deserve any other name) as they contain the same
series of bones as in the 8eal ; and yet no reason can be given
why that is the case. In the Proteosaurus, which partakes
more of the fish than of the whale tribe, there is probably a
greater degree of nicety'of adjustment of motion wanted
than in the whale, and consequently a greater subdivision of
parts, to compensate for the unyielding materials of which
these parts are composed ; and in this instance there are more
than two hundred bones, which must greatly exceed 'the
number of cartilages met with in the fins of the shark. The facts shown in this specimen, it will be admitted, are
of considerable importance, in making us more intimately ac-
quainted with the skeleton of this most extraordinary animal,
The second figure contained in the same Plate,(Pl. XV:)isof a
less interesting nature, because the parts have been repeatedly
shown upon former occasions ; and although there is suffi-
cient resemblance of parts to give the idea of this figure
belonging to the same skull as the other, on which the facts
that have been detailed have their dependance, if that is
admitted, much intervening substance must have been lost. In this figure, the teeth are better seen than in any other
that I have examined; they are distinctly grooved on their
surface up to their points, and are firmly fixed in the jaw,
80 that they are all preserved in their proper place;
