Introduction

The ground-breaking work by Allen et al. [1] was indeed a profound development which led
physicists to a new understanding of the physics of light. The main premise of the work
reported in 1992 was that light modes can be generated, endowed with the property of quantized
orbital angular momentum (OAM). As a concept, OAM was in fact discussed earlier by several
authors, including Belinfante [2] and Humblet [3]. A more recent suggestion about modes with
vortex characteristics analogous to superfluid vortices by Coullet et al. [4] did not recognize
the significance of the quantization of the OAM of light and the possibility of their generation
as constituting a major breakthrough. Research on light carrying OAM swiftly followed the
paper by Allen ef al. [1] and continued apace over the last quarter of a century, leading not
only to fundamental developments in the field of optics but also to a number of significant :
applications [5-7].
