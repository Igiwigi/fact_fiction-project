It is
found that certain properties (the so-called “ conjugate relations ”) which are ordinarily
possessed by “normal” solutions are here no longer satisfied, with the result that
we can no longer show that the time factors are always negative, or even that they are
necessarily real. Again, it is found that the method of expansion employed in the
special case, to express an arbitrary disturbance as a series of disturbances of “ normal”
type, also ceases to apply. This last result suggests the question, whether stability
would in fact be demonstrated if we could prove that all “normal” disturbances (te,

solutions characterised by simple exponential time factors) inevitably decay. We
state our reasons for believing that the proof would be sufficient as regards stability
for infinitesimal disturbances. This appears to be the view of most workers on the
subject.
