becomes finely granular. The evyer-varying appearance called the nucleolus, I appre-
hend to arise from the refraction of light; the degree of which, and the particular situ-
ation in which it occurs, depend chiefly on two circumstances, namely, the condition of
the granular substance by which the pellucid fluid is immediately surrounded, and the
quantity of this fluid which is present. ScnrLEmen considered the presence of #0
(or more) nucleoli as exceptions. I am disposed to regard them as constant at a cer-
tain period ; and as denoting the origin of the two (or more) essential cells.

the elementary structure of Animals and Plants—were referred to on a former occa-
sion||, as being among the most important that had ever resnlted from microscopic
observation . That excellent observer, however, did not attempt to conceal the
fact, that he had met with certain difficulties, and was obliged to leave them for future
explanation. For instance, with reference to the objects he considered hollow and
pellucid nuclei, —differing as he found these to do in their appearance from the ordi-
nary © eytoblast,” —he remarks: © Observation on the transition-steps from the
characteristic form of the nuclei of cells, must furnish the required explanation of

authors on the cells of animal tisxues, VaLevTIy, having given an abstract of the work of Scuwaxy on Cells,

also als Grundschema der ersten Bildung der Gewebtheile in der Thierwelt heraus, dass in einer Fliissigkeit,
