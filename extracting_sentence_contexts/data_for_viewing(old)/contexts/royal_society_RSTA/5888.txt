Here, B is a constant that depends on a and d, but not on 6.

Remark 2.3. With minor modifications to the proof one can ensure that the velocity field u in
proposition 2.2 is in fact smooth, and satisfies ||1(-, t)||cx < C(a,d,k) for all t > 0.

The proof of proposition 2.2 consists of two steps. The first step involves pulling back the shear
flow on the torus from lemma 2.1 to a compactly supported flow in R’. We do this in lemma 2.4,
below. Once this is established, we simply iterate this procedure to obtain exponential growth at
integer times. Since the norm of u is controlled uniformly in time, the H! norm at non-integer
times can be estimated by giving up a small factor.

Lemma 2.4. Let 6 € HER), d>2,and fix T > 0, a’ > 1. There exists a divergence-free vector field u
on R4 x [0, 00) (depending on @, a’ and T) such that the following hold:

(i) The vector field u is piecewise constant in time, is supported on the cube 29 = (—3,4)4, and
satisfies
