consider that the occurrence of an organ of respiration intermediate between the
tracheze of Myriapods and the lungs of Spiders, in an undoubted Myriapod, quite
disposes of the view that the trachez of some Spiders are but modifications of the
pulmonary organs found in others of the group, unless we are prepared to admit that
the highly specialised Myriapod Scutigera is of a more primitive type than
Chilognatha, the other Chilopoda, and Peripatus. My own opinion is, that we have a
series from the simple trachev found in Peripatus up to the complete lungs of Spiders,
which is incapable of explanation in the present state of our knowledge, except
as representing the stages of development of trachew into the pulmonary organ of
Spiders. I consider that the results I have obtained confirm Leuck art's views (8) as
to the way in which the development took place.

Let us now consider what bearing the facts recorded in this paper have on
Lankester’s views. His theory, as already stated, is that the appendages of a
common ancestor of Limulus and Scorpio have developed into the gills of Limulus on
the one hand, and the lungs of Scorpio on the other. Of course it is possible that the
Scorpion’s lung may have a different origin from that of the Spiders. If this is the
case, however, it seems to me that the differences between Spiders and Scorpions
must be much more essential than is at present supposed by most naturalists ; more
so than is, in my opinion, warranted by what is known of their anatomy and
embryology. If the lungs of Scorpions are derived from those of Spiders, and those of
Spiders from trachez, then an important argument in Lanxesrer’s “ Limulus an
Arachnid” falls through.

I must now say a few words on Sepe@wicx’s “ Origin of Metameric Segmentation ”
