T have stated that by means of alcohol this substance may be procured of
a melting-point of 72%. If this substance of 72* melting-point be repeatedly dissolved
and crystallized out of a large quantity, not of alcohol, but of ether, the melting-point
can be raised to 78, in which state the substance is highly crystalline, and has all
the appearance of the acid as procured by other means.

Both the melting-point and the analysis perfectly agree with the melting-point and
analysis of cerotic acid, which have been already given, and with its formula. It is certainly a strange fact that the presence of this body in the wax should s0
long have escaped the notice of chemists. The wax however is a complex substance,
and the cerotic acid to be obtained in purity has to be separated from many other
bodies which disguise its nature and reactions. Should any chemist be induced to verify the results which I have given, I must
beg him als rigidly to observe the methods I have laid down for the preparation and
purification of the substances, for errors which are slight in the analysis of the sub-
Stance and which neither the analysis nor melting-point detect, become of great im-
portance when the transformations of the substance are investigated, and its atomic
weight is to be determined.
