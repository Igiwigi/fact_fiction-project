He found
that small orifices discharged less water in proportion than great ones, on
account of friction ; that the vena contracta, and consequent expenditure,
diminished with the height of the reservoir: he pointed out the law by which
the discharge diminishes according to the inclination and number of bends in
a pipe, and the influence of friction in retarding the velocity of waters moving
in canals and pipes, in which he made the square of the velocity to be in the
inverse ratio of the length of the pipe : he determined the co-efficients by expe-
riment, and thus obtained a formula expressive of the conditions of the uniform
motion of water in open canals. The greater part of these hypotheses may be
said to have been removed by the more extensive researches of Dupuar, His
great hydraulic work, published in 1779 and 1786, contains a series of the most
valuable obseryations, whose results accord very nearly with the new formula
of the motion of water in pipes and open conduits ; and his experiments, with
pipes inclined in various angles from the 40,000th part of a right angle to 90
degrees, and in channels which yaried from a line and a half in diameter to
areas of seyen or eight square toises, seem to comprehend every case of in-
clination ; 80 that by collecting a prodigious number of facts, both with com-
pressible and incompressible fluids, he obtained a general expression for all
cases relative to the friction and cohesion of fluids : but a logarithmic function
which he introduces in it, by a sort of approximation, gives it a character of
uncertainty, which restrains its use, and shows the necessity of fresh researches. Vexrurr, in 1798, © Sur la Communication.lat6rale du Mouvements dans les

the expenditure of differently shaped orifices and tubes, but particularly on the
lateral communication of motion by the cohesion of fluids. CovLoms first
approximated to the solution of the question, by a yery ingenious apparatus,
consisting of discs of different sizes, fixed by their centres to the lower extre-
mity of a brass wire, and made to oscillate in fluids by the force of torsion
only; he concluded that the resistance was a function, composed of two terms,
one proportional to the first, the other to the second powers of the'resistance:
again, that it was not sensibly increased by increasing the height of the fluid,
but simply by the cohesion of the particles of the fluid which presented greater
or less resistance, in proportion to the viscidity of the fluid, oil being to water
in the ratio of 17.5 to 1. But whatever might be the conclusions of CouLous,
it is obvious that both the s8ize and construction of his apparatus were ill cal-
culated to produce results whereon to found a satisfactory theory; and accord-
ingly both Messrs.
