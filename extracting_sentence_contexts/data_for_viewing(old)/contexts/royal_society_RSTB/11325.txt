favour of monogamous marriage [44]. The Great Leap For-
ward (1958-1962) resulted in widespread famine and
depressed fertility all over China (e.g. [65]) that may have
had effects on the timing of ALB in our sample of Mosuo
women. Notably, these policies regulated fertility, marriage
and subsistence. We know of no specific sanctions against con-
tinued reproduction at advanced ages among the Mosuo, so
the specific mechanisms of social transmission remain obscure.
Nonetheless, the regional scale at which we see village-level
differences in ALB suggests that cultural norms associated
with matri- or patrilineal institutions may play a role in repro-
ductive timing. While the patrilineal area is in more rugged
terrain, the fact that ALB has dropped so dramatically as con-
ditions improved in the later twentieth century suggests that
people are ceasing to reproduce earlier than physiological con-
straints influenced by a difficult working environment would
mandate. It is thus unlikely that genetic differences or simple
ecological differences with physiological knock-on effects can
account for the variation in reproductive timing documented
here.

The pattern of declining ALB alongside fertility restriction
is consistent with behavioural ecological models that envi-
sage benefits to earlier reproduction [5]. While front-loading
strategies might be transmitted via cultural learning mechan-
