In contrast to that,
in differentiated cells LIN28a is not expressed [42,164]. In its
absence, TUT4/7 add prevalently just a single uridine to the
3’ end of the pre-let-7 RNAs. In fact, miRNA precursors fall
into two families regarding their 3! end: it is either a 2-nucleo-
tide 3’ overhang (group I of prototypical pre-miRNA) or just a
single nucleotide 3’ overhang (group II). Since DICER requires
a 2-nucleotide 3’ overhang for processing of the pre-miRNA
into mature miRNA, group II pre-miRNA comprising a
majority of let-7 family RNAs cannot be processed [42]. How-
ever, once monouridylated, the group II pre-miRNAs are
conveyed to the later steps of their maturation [42,43].
