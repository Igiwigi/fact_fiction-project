Questions about the origins of modern human diversity, the diversity observed
among living people and their unique ancestors, are as old as the discipline
of Anthropology. Early evolutionary models sought answers in the regional differ-
ences in Pleistocene hominin morphology to account for contemporary differences
among human groups [1,2]. These multiregional models suffered from an over-
emphasis on differences, positing independent or partially independent deep
evolutionary trajectories of human populations in different parts of the world. How-
ever, morphological and genetic research since the late 1980s established that all
humans are more closely related to each other than to any Late Quaternary hominin
group. This showed that humans share an ancestor who lived after other hominin
lineages had diverged [3-8], confirmed through palaeogenomic studies [9,10].
These and subsequent studies have also shown that the people of Africa are more
diverse than all other human populations [11], and together with the fact that the
earliest anatomically modern human fossils are found in Ethiopia [12-14], point
to sub-Saharan Africa as the place of origin of the species around 200000 years
ago (200 ka), consistent with genetic results [15].
