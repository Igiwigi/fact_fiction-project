Attempts have been begun to demonstrate the inducing capacity of mesoderm by
making grafts of notochord from older embryos into younger blastoderms. Three
grafts have been made from a 50-hour embryo into a 20-hour blastoderm, but, although
the notochord lived and probably developed normally, no induction occurred, The
number of experiments is, of course, insufficient to prove a negative, and even if further
work gives the same result, that negative will apply in the first instance only to a later
stage than that of the grafts of primitive streak. |

If it is granted that the induction obtained with pieces of primitive streak is, at
least in part, due to the mesoderm which is developed, important differences between
this induction and induction by the roof of the primitive gut in Amphibia immediately
demand notice. In the Amphibian case, all the material which is invaginated through
the blastopore appears to be capable of functioning as an organiser, and in fact probably
does so in normal development. In the present case, on the other hand, only the last
invaginated mesoderm, that is, the most axial parts, can possibly act as an organisation
centre in normal development. The invagination goes on approximately perpendicularly
to the length of the future neural tube. For the same reason, the induced neural plates
in these experiments do not usually extend much beyond the pieces of tissue by which
they have been induced. (They do, indeed, extend beyond the pieces of neural tissue
derived from the grafts, but this, it is urged, is to be taken as evidence that the induction
is partly caused by the mesoderm, beyond which they do not extend.)

3. Repair and Regeneration in the Primitive Streak.

If pieces of the primitive streak are removed and cultivated separately, as grafts,
