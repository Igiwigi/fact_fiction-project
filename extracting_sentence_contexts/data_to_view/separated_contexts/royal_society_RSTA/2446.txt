approach. Some small differences between the tails of two CIRs are observed. This is due to the
fact that our light source is a commercial light source and does not behave exactly as a Lambertian
source ( figure 7b) unlike the ideal source assumed in [49]. In an effort to have a better understanding of the impact of higher order reflections, figure 12
presents the channel DC gain and RMS delay spread with respect to reflection numbers. It is
observed that there is no notable change for values larger than k=4 in an empty room under
consideration.
