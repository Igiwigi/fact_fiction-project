The EDGE and HEDGE scores were calculated for all
species with IUCN values in our molecular phylogeny
(figure 4). Calculations of EDGE ranged from 35.54 to 0.36,
while calculations for HEDGE ranged from 34.91 to 0.12. Fall-

all species. The 10 species with the highest EDGE and HEDGE
scores include species that are critically endangered and
