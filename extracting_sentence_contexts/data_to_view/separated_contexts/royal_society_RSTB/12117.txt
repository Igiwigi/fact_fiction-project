For high-throughput separation of
single cells, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) systems
have been the most widely used instruments, both in model
systems and for studies concerning microbial ecology and
diversity in the environment [37]. In scRNA-seq applications,
FACS is used to select specific populations of interest and col-
lect single-cells in 96- or 384-well plates [38]. FACS can
simultaneously record multiple parameters for each sorted
cell and these metadata can be used together with single-
cell gene expression. FACS-enabled scRNA-seq offers

The last few years have seen tremendous development of
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies and a
rapid increase in the number of studies using this method. Most of these studies sampled vertebrate cells, but the same
procedures have also been successfully applied to other
eukaryotes [18-22].
