For the ambulacral characters of the Palszeozoic Echinoids, I have relied almost
entirely on JacKson’s “ Phylogeny of the Echini” (1912). The account of these
structures in the other Regular orders has been gathered from a very large number
of sources.

The classification adopted for the post-Palzeozoic forms is that given by Grecory
(1900). Although the more recent taxonomic system of JACKSON (1912) is available,
and in some respects preferable, it has proved more satisfactory to treat of the
morphology of the ambulacra in association with the older scheme. This is doubtless
due to the close accord between Grecory’s classification and that of Duncan (1889) ;
the latter was based mainly on ambulacral characters. The section was originally
written out on JAcKson’s system, but the result abounded in repetition and failed
to bring out the morphogenetic facts clearly. Whether this was due to defects in
the classification, or to the existence of numerous lines of parallel development, is a
matter that cannot profitably be considered here. Systematic discussion is out of
place in a paper devoted to purely morphological topics; especially since reference
to non-Holectypoid orders is merely incidental to the main purpose of the work.

(b) Bothriocidaris.

Bothriocidaris is not merely the oldest Echinoid known but morphologically it
approximates remarkably to the theoretical phylembryo of the class. Tt is necessary,
therefore, that the ambulacral characters of this interesting form should be understood,
before their subsequent modifications can be co-ordinated. Thanks largely to the work
of Jackson, such knowledge is now available. The descriptions and figures given by
