Had the plants in both cases been the same, I see no
reason for doubting that when distilled they would have yielded identical bases. Formation of Organic Bases from the nitrogenous Principles of Vegetables and Animals
otherwise than by destructive Distillation.

1. By treating them with alkaline lyes. â€”From the facts which haye been previously
stated, I think we are warranted to conclude, that when ammonia is produced in
large quantities by the destructive distillation of either vegetable or animal s8ub-
stances, it is always accompanied by the formation of organic bases. Now as am-
monia is known to be procurable from these substances by several other methods, it
seemed by no means improbable that on these occasions organic bases would also be
produced. It has long been known that ammonia is largely generated when the
nitrogenous portions of either plants or animals are boiled with strong alkaline lyes.
