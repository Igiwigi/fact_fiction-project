The largest eggs in which I found Purkinjean vesicles were from 3335ths to z3Igths
of an inch in diameter, the vesicle being about one-third of that size.

The mature eggs from the cavity of the ovary were about 55gths in diameter, and
nearly spherical in shape. They contained the usual yelk-masses, of which the larger
ones were xx5;75ths of an inch in diameter, and under pressure split at the sides like
those of Tulus. They contained no Purkinjean vesicle.

IT was for some time much puzzled by finding among the ordinary eggs certain spindle-
shaped bodies, some of which were very narrow, while others were 80 broad as scarcely
to differ from the spherical eggs, except by having one side flattened. They were
$urrounded by a layer of epithelial cells, contained ordinary yelk, with generally a
Purkinjean vesicle, and in fact possessed all the characteristics of true eggs. For some
time I believed that, besides the spherical eggs, other more or less spindle-shaped ones
were produced in the ovary of Lithobius, so that, as in Daphnia, the same ovary gave rise
to two sorts of reproductive bodies. At length, however, it occurred to me to cut off
part of a young egg; and I then at once found that the larger portion of the wounded
egg was one of my spindle-shaped bodies, which therefore were nothing more nor less
than the ova which had been accidentally cut through in the dissection of the ovary.
If, however, the eggs are too large, they simply burst when cut, and the contents escape.
The most suitable ones are those which contain granules and have not yet developed
any large oil-globules. "This observation would be scarcely worth mentioning, were it
not that the cut surface of the yelk presents an outline which is as well defined as

the other parts, and shows no trace of the wound. It is of course evident that this part
