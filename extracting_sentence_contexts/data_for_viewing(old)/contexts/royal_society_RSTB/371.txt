These pup are certainly darker, as a whole, than the unblinded ones, but the
difference is not great enough to suggest the blinding as a necessary cause, while
other experiments (to follow) clearly show that it cannot have been effective in this
way.

This concludes the experiments conducted upon the larvee of Series IL., kindly sent
me by Mr. Popz, The great mortality was due to the fact that the larvee were sent
very young, and were thus brought up for nearly the whole period of larval life in
unnatural conditions. In the following experiments I made use of larvae which were
fuund in various localities near Oxford, and which were allowed to remain upon the
nettle-bed until they were nearly mature. In this way I secured a very high
percentage of pup. Nevertheless, in the experiments just recorded (II.), that
insight into the colour sensitiveness of the species was gained which rendered all the
following experiments possible and suggested the various modifications and details.

III.—A company of mature larvee was found August 15 beside the towing-path of
the “ Upper River,” near Oxford. In the press of other work they were in some cases
temporarily placed in short, wide, glass cylinders, covered with sheets of glass, until the
night of August 16, when they were counted and to some extent re-arranged, but in
