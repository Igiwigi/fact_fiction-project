tures but solutions of one metal in the other, may be deduced from the fact of their
fusing-points being generally lower than the mean of that of the volumes taken.

Secondly. To what is the rapid decrement of the conducting power due ?

The only answer which I can at present give to this question, is that most of the
other physical properties of the metal are altered in a like manner; for on looking at
the alloys made with the metals of Class A. with one another, we see that most of their
other physical properties are not at all altered ; for amongst them, for instance, we find
no brittle ones; they appear, in fact, to take an equal share of the properties of the
metals composing them. But now let us examine the alloys of the second class, and
we immediately discover great differences ; alloy gold, the most ductile of all metals,
with small per-centages of tin, lead, or zinc, and it becomes as brittle as glass. Again,
alloy silver with small per-centages of the above metals, and its properties are much
altered. Silver, which, when pure, is one of the easiest metals to draw, when alloyed
with more than 3 per cent. of tin and 2 per cent, of lead, becomes s0 brittle, and its
tenacity 80 much impaired, that it cannot be drawn. I do nob mean to say it is impos-
8Ible to do 80, but it was tried several times without success. On the other hand, we
do not find any marked differences in the ductility, hardness, &ec. of tin or lead when
alloyed with silver; we may add 10, nay even 20 per cent. of silver to them, and they
remain ductile, and may be pressed into wire without any trouble. Of course, with lead
and tin alloyed with s8mall quantities of gold, the case is s0mewhat different, as we have
