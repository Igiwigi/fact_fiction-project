I want, however, direct observations in sufficient number, and
Shall here only mention an obseryation from the Caribbean Sea, where surface-water
contained 19:936 chlorine, and water from a depth of 1170 feet contained 19:823 per
1000 chlorine. This difference in which the deeper water is less saline may be another
instance of the effect of hot winds, like the water from the Mediterranean between
Africa and the Island of Candia. Going on now to the main section of the ocean, we will begin with the Atlantic,
about which we have the best information, and which seems to show the most interesting
facts. I will state the results of my investigations in moving from Baffin's Bay towards
the south, In Baffin's Bay itself the water of the surface contains the same quantity of
salt as that of the depth, but as s0on as we pass the southernmost point of Greenland, the
water of the surface contains more alt than that from the depth. 'This difference
increases in going towards the Equator, and is indeed very considerable near that line. About the Equator, and a little to the south of it, many irregularities appear, as, for
instance, in one case where the strongest water was found between two weaker portions
above and below.
