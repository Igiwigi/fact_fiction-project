time should have been multiplied by some fraction lying between 1—K,(1—X,)* and
1—K(1-XY.

Now at the beginning of the first period K,='0364 and M,=0365, and ab the end
K=-0865 and A=0346.

Whence K,(1—X,)*=-034, K(1—X)*=:080.

Hence it follows that the time, in the first period of the integration of Section 15,
may have been over-estimated by some percentage less than some number lying
between 3 and 8.

In fact, I have corrected the first period of that integration by a rather more tedious
process than that here exhibited, and I found that the time was over-estimated by a
little less than 3 per cent. And it was found that we ought to subtract from the
46,300,000 years comprised within the first period about 1,300,000 years. I also found
that the error in the final value of the obliquity could hardly amount to more than 1'or 2”.

In the later periods of integration the error in the time would no doubt be a little
larger fraction of the time comprised within each period, but as it is not interesting to
find the time in anything but round numbers, it is not worth while to find the
corrections.

There is another point worth noticing. It might be suspected that when we
