Miss Grrry’s article
(1910) referred to in Section 4b deals with the occurrence of the bars of Sanio in the
different groups of the Conifers, but does not attempt a regional study of an individual
to gain the phylogenetic evidence from this source. 1 have. examined the cone axis,
root and stem wood of the adult and seedling of various forms of the Abietinee, etc.,
and find that the thickening of the primary wall described by Santo is always found
in the primitive regions of the plant in intimate association with the pit. It is very
small in these regions as compared with its condition in later root and stem wood. In fact, where the pits are multi-seriate, as in young root wood, there may not be a
trace of the bar of Sanio (fig. 36a, Plate 4). Ina stage toward the adult condition
these bars connect horizontally, extending beyond the pits themselves and connecting
between the series of pits by mere traces at first (fig. 36¢, Plate 4), which later become
as thick or even thicker than the original parts. Finally, the bars may become quite
separated from the pits, as is the typical condition for the adult wood.
