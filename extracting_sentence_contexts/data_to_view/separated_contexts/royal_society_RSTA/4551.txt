instead of 1370°C.,

about three divisions instead of twelve, so that pumping out the gas had
apparently increased the leak. This paradoxical result is probably caused by the fact
that the above method of reckoning over-corrects for the effect of loss by spluttering. A calculation from the numbers in the last table but one shows that the wire had lost
