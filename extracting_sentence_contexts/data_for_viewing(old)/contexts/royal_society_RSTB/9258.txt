function, such as stress, intonation or timbre cues may be modi-
fied to direct attention towards elements with important
syntactic functions (e.g. stability or marking departures at con-
stituent or phrase boundaries; further empirical research is,
however, required to examine such connections). Altogether
vector grammars may constitute a well-suited formalism to
capture the use of noisy, non-tonal and complex sounds in
music across cultures that may be challenging for traditional
symbolic models.

One interesting feature of vector grammars is that they are
computationally more expressive than their symbolic
counterpartsâ€”in fact, they result in an entirely different


class of complexity that is not comparable with the models of
the CH from which the models originated (this is due to the
large amounts of information that the large real-valued vec-
tors may carry). For instance, Rodriguez [157] demonstrated
that a right-branching vector grammar (or, in fact, its special
case, the Elman network [150]) can generate several context-
free languages, even though it is well-known that right-
branching symbolic grammars are finite-state. The reason is,
Rodriquez argues, that small displacements in a continuous
vector space can be used to implement a counter. We may
