Dhe manure, and that almost the whole of the increase is due to the comparatively

lamrooking Lathyrus. Tt is, however, worthy of note that the partial separations

of the second crops indicate a lower proportion, and scarcely any more actual produce,

Sof the mixed leguminous herbage with the manure than without manure ; and ib is

also significant that, in these second crops, the 7yfoliums bear @ much larger propor-

-2 tion to the Lathyrus than in the first. An exanination of the samples of the partial

3 8eparations leads to the conelusion that, this is explained by the fact that, owing to the

S habit and conformation of the plants, new and stronger shoots are more freely pro-

E duced from the thick-branched stock of the Trefoils which remain after cutting, than

Efrom the comparatively thinner and less branching stock of the Zathyrus, in which

EZ the relatively few shoots that are produced after cutting are of very slender and feeble

Z character.
