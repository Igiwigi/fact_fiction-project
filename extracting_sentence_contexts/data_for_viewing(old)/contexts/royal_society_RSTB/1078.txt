At 9 A.M., on March 23, the plate was photographed, with the result showr
A very faint* circular image of each window was becoming visible, and in ty

After a further day’s incubation the five circular areas were each perfectly
shown in fig. 19, and differences were still more observable. After yet anot
the plate was at its best, or, strictly speaking, a little past its best, as seen in

On comparing the figures we notice that the relative sharpness depend ,
far each circular area is cleared of spores capable of germinating. As a ma k
all five areas on the third day had some spores still living on them,
evident that the two top ones, A and B, had fewer than the two bo
D and E, and even than the centre one C—facts brought out more cleadil
photographs than in the reproductions. ;

If each area had an equal number of spores on it to begin with, we should exy
the order of clearness, 7.e., the sharpness of the figure, to be in the order of 4
exposure, C was exposed 6 hours, D only 5 hours, whence C should be es
than D. Nowin the figure this is not the case. But it was the case the day h
and the only reason that C is not now the clearer is because a large number of or
have germinated on the area C, and are rendering it somewhat obscure. j

As a matter of fact, the order of clearness of the areas was just what we show
expect in Stage I.
