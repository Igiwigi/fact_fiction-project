example, on the specimen shown in transverse section in fig. 7. They are most
conspicuous, however, on the cupule of the young seed or ovule (U. C. L., R. 13)
represented in fig. 34, where they occur in abundance on a long lobe of the cupule,
forming a conspicuous tuft at its extremity (/). On the older cupules they are but
sparsely present ; probably they belonged to the young condition of the organ, and
were shed as it advanced in age. The hairs are cylindrical structures (fig. 8),
consisting of a single row of three or four cells, or perhaps more, for they are rarely
seen complete. The cells are about 20 in diameter, and range in length from about
30-60p.

Summary of Cupule.

The chief facts with regard to the cupule of Lagenostoma Lomaxt may be briefly
summed up as follows :â€”

The young seed was enclosed in a cupule or envelope exceeding the seed in length.
Mature seeds are sometimes found still within the cupule, but are more often free.

The cupule was borne terminally on a pedicel ; it formed a continuous ribbed cup
below, and divided above into a number of lobes or segments.

The pedicel contained a single vascular bundle, which, before entering the chalaza,
gave off numerous branches into the cupule, traversing it throughout its length and
extending into the segments.
