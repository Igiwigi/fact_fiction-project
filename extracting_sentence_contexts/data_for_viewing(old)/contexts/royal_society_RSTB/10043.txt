The covariation between innovative propensity and life his-
tory could reflect the fact that both attributes have evolved
together (either through correlated evolution or shared mechan-
isms) or that one is the cause of the other. Although our results do
not allow us to really establish causalities, our path analyses
suggest that all three scenarios are plausible. First, correlated
selection may have favoured enhanced behavioural plasticity
and low brood values (derived from long lives) in species con-
stantly challenged by new problems such as ecological
generalists. Second, large brains needed to innovate require
longer developmental periods, and this may have constrained
the evolution of innovativeness in species with a fast pace-of-
life. Finally, a future returns strategy may have further selected
