than 90°, even though z may exceed 90°; also it exceeds z,, given by sin z, =
rsin z/(r +94). When k = 1, 3 or 2, the integration in J, can be performed as before (after
substituting for c, and making the usual approximation to /), but only over the
range m= (0 to m= m,; the fact that ¢, is a function of y, and therefore of m,
complicates the corresponding integration over the rest of the range. The first
part of J, is
