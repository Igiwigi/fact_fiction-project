It is perhaps following upon this that subdivision of the dilatator has occurred in the
more specialized species of Rana. The apical cartilage is a structure probably of equal
interest from functional and phylogenetic points of view, for its reliability in classi-
fication is considerable.

The function of the cartilago basalis is more difficult to suggest. In a well-developed
form, it was thought to be confined to the Hylide, but it is now seen to be typically
present also in Pseudopaludicola falcipes. That it is related to voice production may
be conjectured from its presence in the male alone. It is unreliable as an aid to
classification.

From the phylogenetic point of view the differentiation of the laryngeal muscles
is perhaps the most interesting feature here revealed. The main facts were known
before, but the range of their application is first seen now. The Discoglossidw and
Tiopelma may be said figuratively to be in an experimental stage as regards the con-
strictor musculature. In other Phaneroglossa a constrictor externus is always present.

The remainder of the constrictor is differentiated in all except Bufo, Dendrophryniscus
Atelopus, and Oreophrynella, into anterior and posterior parts. The posterior becomes
attached to the ends of the vocal chords, with the intermediacy of the pulvinaria
vocalia, and is thus specialized as a tensor chordarum. The anterior remains a ring-
muscle in some members of each group, but shows a tendency to become attached to
