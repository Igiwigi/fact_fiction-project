As noted in the Introduction, several studies of the T, of S/F bilayers as a function of F-layer
thickness were carried out in the mid-1990s. More interesting, however, is the study of T, of
F/S/F’ or S/F’/F trilayers as a function of the relative direction of the magnetizations of the two
ferromagnetic layers. This idea dates back to a suggestion by de Gennes in 1966 [55], followed by
an experiment by Deutscher & Meunier in 1969 [56]. The idea then lay dormant for nearly three
decades until Oh et al. [57], Tagirov [58] and Buzdin et al. [59] independently discovered different
versions of the idea in the late 1990s and Tagirov named it a ‘spin switch’. In 2002, the idea was
realized experimentally by Gu et al. [60], who measured the T, of a thin Nb film sandwiched
between two CuNi films, and found a slight difference in T; between the configurations when
the two magnetizations were parallel or antiparallel. We followed that up by replacing CuNi with
pure Ni, and found a somewhat larger, but still rather small, T, difference [61]. Since then, many
groups have contributed to this area, using both F/S/F’ and S/F’/F configurations. There was
some controversy over the fact that either the parallel or antiparallel configuration can have a
larger Tc, which depends partly on the relative importance of exchange physics and stray field
effects. We will not discuss here the many papers addressing that topic. The culmination of this
work is the observation of complete switching between the normal-state resistance and zero
resistance by changing from the parallel to the antiparallel magnetization state, which has been
achieved in an S/F’/F system by a Russian—German collaboration [62], and in a FI/S/FI system
(where FI = ferromagnetic insulator) by Moodera’s group at MIT [63].

Keeping the two magnetizations in an F/S/F’ or S/F’ /F structure either parallel or antiparallel
limits the proximity effect to the short-range components only, i.e. the spin singlet and m; =0
spin triplet. If the two magnetizations are non-collinear, however, then spin-triplet components
should be generated. It was predicted theoretically that, in that case, one should observe a T; that
is lower in the non-collinear configuration than in either the parallel or antiparallel configurations
