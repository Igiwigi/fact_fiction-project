Before filtering for the G*E association, the dataset included 46
999 947 SNPs. SnpEff (v. 4.3; [60]) was used to annotate genetic
variants based on H. melpomene reference genome annotation. Our reference genome Hmel2 turned out to contain an
assembly error: a 45853 bp contig considered to be on the
chromosome 7 was in fact on chromosome 15 within the super-
gene. This explains the peak of association on chromosome 7
(figure 2). The misplacement of the scaffold on chromosome 7
was determined by mapping this scaffold with BLAST on the
NCBI database and by aligning this scaffold on an improved

H. melpomene genome published after the performance of the
analyses presented here ([61]; electronic supplementary material,
figure S14).
