* to ingesta, in which both substances are mingled impartially. Further,
‘quite usual in vigorous polypes to get a replacement of one set of ingesta by
rs of unlike nature, when the suspended particles proper to each group are made
nderate successively outside the animal. And in experimenting thus, I have
Mbeen able to note any clearly selective ingestion; coagulated proteid may
aZ carmine or bacteria, and may be ousted in turn by Indian ink or milk ;
Be quantity or distribution of matter that determines its entrance rather than
ilability for subsequent digestion. Even after enclosure, the onward movement
eression is characteristic, and, the phase of quiescence being ended (usually)
 Bypical movement of aggregation, retrogression follows. Finally, after a pause
iB “area of solution,” discharge takes place from the anal ridge. Only in
‘uration of these several events, and in the really important details, the
ppings to this bare thread of movement, can we trace the fact that innutritious
#gr does not stimulate the cell substance of Carchesium so effectually as does
gible food.
tothe first place, the time of enclosure is short. I will not anticipate the more
ed statement on this point which is to follow, but will only say that this
iBution does not affect the first periods I have distinguished. The time taken up
pRogression and quiescence is, on the whole, very slightly longer than when true
stufis form the ingesta. But sojourn in the area of solution and the area
discharge is shortened, and 40 to 60 minutes after the first enclosure, ejection
ve been even considerable.
ib the second place, it is noticeable that very many non-nutrient ingesta are
rged without that re-formation of vacuole which marks the actual solution
Ggestible matter. Deprived of fluid after the movement of retrogression is over,
