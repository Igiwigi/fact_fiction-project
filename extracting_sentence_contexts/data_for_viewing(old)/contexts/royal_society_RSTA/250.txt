uncertainties remain, give people choices whenever possible (e.g. label GM food).

This relatively simple list of precepts was set out in the Protocols for Science
Advice in Policy Making issued by John Major’s Government in 1996. They have
subsequently been reviewed and reaffirmed by Tony Blair’s Government in 1997
and 2000 and by Gordon Brown’s Government in 2006 (at each iteration they
have grown bulkier, but their essentials remain unchanged). Independent support
for such rules also has been provided (with acknowledgement of the originating
1996 document) by the Phillips Inquiry into BSE in 2000 and the House of Lords
Science & Technology Select Committee in 2000 (the Jenkins Report).

Enunciating an ideal process is one thing. Embedding it as standard operating
procedure is another. Eloquent testimony to this sad fact is provided by the recent
episode of Professor Nutt’s dismissal from the Chair of the Advisory Committee
on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD). Indeed, given the apparent need to reincarnate
such protocols for science advice in policy making at regular intervals, I suspect
similar rules were enunciated prior to 1996 and that I am guilty of being unaware
of them!

Quite apart from this ‘embedding’ issue, there are other major problems in
implementing such guidelines for good practice.

For one thing, the scientific facts are simply not relevant for many individuals
and groups whose views are determined by fixed, unquestioning ideologies
(religious beliefs, political doctrines, and so on). For such individuals, no observed
