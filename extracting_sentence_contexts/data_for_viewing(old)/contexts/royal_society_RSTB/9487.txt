work environments. These particles were identified as dried
paint droplets of a DuPont high-end specialty product
known as Imron. This product had been used at the truck
plant where the defendant was employed, and the paint evi-
dence was the basis for charging him with four additional


counts of homicide. However, the original association
between the defendant and some of the victims had to be
achieved through DNA first. Although considered crucial to
associate additional victims with the defendant and securing
a guilty plea, unsurprisingly, paint evidence could not lead
the investigation despite the fact the information was poten-
tially available on the victims’ clothing. It is not difficult to
imagine the value of this information for the case resolution
and more broadly crime prevention (given the serial nature
of these cases) if such dried droplets could have been quickly
detected, recognized and identified to a type of paint used by
a truck plant in the area of the murders employing an individ-
ual who had been previously identified as a person of interest
for the investigation through traditional police methods. It is
worth exploring the topic beyond these anecdotal examples
in the next paragraphs.
