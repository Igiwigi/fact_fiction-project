tacles and polypite were exceedingly relaxed, which is an interesting fact, as being the
converse of that which occurs in water containing too small a proportion of salt.
Lastly, to give the density hypothesis a still more complete trial, I dissolved various
neutral salts and other substances, such as sugar &c., in fresh water till it was of the
density of sea-water ; but in all cases, on immersing Sars/@ in such solutions, death was
as rapid as that which followed their immersion in fresh water.

VII. GENERAL SUMMARY.

The © fundamental experiment” of paralyzing nectocalyces by removing their margin
has this year been repeated a vast number of times on various species of naked-eyed
Medusz, and always with the same result. In the case of the covered-eyed Medux, I
have confirmed 8uch of my previous observations as required confirmation, from the fact
of their having been at variance with those of Dr. E1xer. I have continued to find that
the lithocysts are the exclusive seats of spontaneity, s0 ſar as the © primary movements ”
are concerned, I have failed to detect the slightest evidence of spontaneity on the part
of the contractile zones. T am $till unable to say that the * secondary contractions *”
appear to me either more * feeble,” © inefficient,” or © local ” than the primary ones;
neither can I modify my previous statements as to the time during which these
