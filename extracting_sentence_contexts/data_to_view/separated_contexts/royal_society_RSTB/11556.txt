The second way to probe
this potential dissociation between the experience of (and
ability to discriminate) the elements and their relation is to
limit perception on the basis of a data-driven manipulation
(e.g. masking). While this test is not a critical one for the
non-Overflow interpretation, note that it is critical for the
Overflow one. If we find under masking that observers can
report a relation better than they can report the elements
that constitute that relation, this would pose a problem to
the Overflow position, which posits that relations are com-
puted based on (transiently) conscious representations of
elements and that ‘relations without relata’ are, as a matter
of fact, phenomenologically impossible.’

We also chose to probe the simplest relation between just
two elements: same versus different. Note that the CD dis-
crimination (especially in Exp. 3 of Bronfman ef al.) is
probing if the elements are similar/dissimilar, and thus this
is the true analogue of this type of CD for a reduced set of
two elements. Specifically, we asked if it is possible to dis-
criminate that two simple visual elements (letters such as X,
O, T) are same or different, without being able to identify
them.
