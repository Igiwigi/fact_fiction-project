The


MR. T. T. GROOM ON THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF CIRRIPEDIA. 127

It may therefore be regarded as firmly established that the ova arising, as described
by Kroun, Kossmann, MUNTER and Bucunotz, Hoek, and others, in the branched
ovary, pass along the oviduct to the base of the first pair of cirri, and are ejected
thence into the mantle cavity, where, cemented together, they form the ovigerous
lamella. As to the method of fertilization, Darwrv (10), Fritz MÃ©tirr (55), and Spence
Bare (21) have given facts showing that cross fertilization must take place in some
cases. When cross fertilization fails the position of the penis seems eminently suited
for self-fertilization, as inferred by Martin Saunt ANGE (54). As to exactly at what moment fertilization takes place I have little fresh evidence.
