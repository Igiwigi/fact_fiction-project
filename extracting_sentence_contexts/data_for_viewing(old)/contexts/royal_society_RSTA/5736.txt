eddy viscosity term goes as t~7/4, soon or later buoyancy dominates (i.e. its decay is slower) over
the eddy viscosity. This happens provided that t > ty = u9/(BgTo). For t > ty, the acceleration on
the left-hand side of the Navier-Stokes equations now balances the buoyancy term: uy /t ~~ u2 /L~

Let us now move to analyse the two-point statistics and assume that the bulk quantities, we
have identified serve as large-scale properties of the flow, below which a cascade process may
originate according to a generalized Kolmogorov—Obukhov picture. The idea is that, despite the
fact that the problem at hand is not stationary, and thus very far from the classical playground of
the Kolmogorov theory, small-scale turbulent fluctuations can rapidly relax to the slower large-
scale dynamics. This is the essence of the adiabaticity hypothesis leading to a generalization of
the classical Kolmogorov theory for a turbulent puff. We refer to [8] for the phenomenological
theory when the buoyancy is negligible. Here, we focus our attention on the sole regime where
buoyancy dominates and the bulk puff properties are ruled by the scaling laws (3.1). The starting
point is to assume the existence of an inertial range of scales characterized by a constant flux of
energy given by e(f) ~ up/L ~ (6,u)°/r. Exploiting the scaling behaviours (3.1) one immediately
gets €(#) ~ €0(to/tp)!/7(t/to)* and
