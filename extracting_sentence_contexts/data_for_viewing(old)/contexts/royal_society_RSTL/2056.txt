into the Laws of the Vital Functions.

instead of being only one of many agents, is the only one capable of ex-
citing the muscular fibre ; and consequently that all others act through it, s0

through which they influence it.

64 DR. PHILIP ON THE NERVOUS AND MUSCULAR SYSTEMS

It is true that as mechanical impulse affecting a nerve of yoluntary motion
is capable, after its separation from the brain and spinal marrow, of exciting,
through it, the muscle in which it terminates, and we cannot be assured that
we have separated from the muscular fibre the whole of the neryes with which
