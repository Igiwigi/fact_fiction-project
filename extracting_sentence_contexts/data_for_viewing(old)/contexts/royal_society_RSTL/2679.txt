period +. It is therefore not until we present a neutral conducting body to an insu-
lated charged body that we begin to disturb the electrical distribution, which may
have been previously uniform.

50. In the course of this and the preceding communication I have ventured occa-
slonally to scrutinize the prevailing theories of electricity, and advert to the opinions
entertained by many profound inquirers in this department of science. I would not,
however, be thought insensible to their claims on our confidence. The researches
of many distinguished philosophers on the Continent, together with those which have
reflected 80 much honour on the science of our own country, must necessarily receive
from every impartial mind the warmest admiration. 1t must not, therefore, be for-
gotten, that whilst detailing a series of facts carefully deduced by induction and ex-

periment, I have no undue bias in favour of peculiar views of my own ; my only object
being, by new physical researches, to improve our acquaintance with one of the most
subtle and powerful agencies in nature.
