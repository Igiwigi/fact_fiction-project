— B-browse metadata supports understanding the context of data and choosing
between similar datasets. This concept is further described below in §2a.

— C-character metadata includes citations of the data itself, and post-fact
assertions as to the quality of the data. Typically, such metadata does not always
exist packaged with the data itself, but may exist in third party repositories (e.g.
journal archives), etc. (Note that C-metadata itself may be discoverable by
D-metadata.

— D-discovery metadata is a subset of the browse and archive metadata, which
is selected to aid finding data for evaluation or visualization and/or other
uses. Typically discovery metadata is harvested and/or submitted to other
organizations to aid data discovery.

— E-extra metadata is the core discipline- or instrument-specific metadata, which
may be strongly typed (i.e. conforms to schema such as SensorML*) or consist
of arbitrary documents.
