When the anatomist shall find both the portio dura of the
seventh and the fifth going to the integuments of the head
and face, he may naturally ask, why are there two nerves to
the surface? and he will probably reflect, that although the
principal office of the nerves of the skin is to convey impres-
sion to the sensorium, yet the influence of the mind is con-
veyed to the surface. The condition of the mind in passion,
for example, is as forcibly communicated to the skin- as to
the muscles themselves; and therefore if a branch of the fifth
be necessary to convey sensation from the surface to the
sensorium, the seventh is necessary to the change of vascular
action, and to the condition of the pores when affected by a
cause proceeding from within, outwards. I feel a hesitation when I reason upon any other ground
than on the facts of anatomy, Experiments are more apt to
be misinterpreted ; and the very circumstance of a motor and


the voluntary muscles with the brain. 173

sensitive nerve being generally combined together, affords a
pregnant source of error. It is natural to suppose that the galvanic influence might
be brought to bear on this subject ; but I may be permitted
to suggest to any one who pursues it in this way, that it will
be necessary to distinguish the effects produced by the nerve
as a mere conductor, and when performing its living functions. The nerve, dead or alive, may convey the galvanic power
like a wet cord; but if the nerve be in possession of its living
property, a great. deal will depend on the direction in which
the galvanic fluid is transmitted.
