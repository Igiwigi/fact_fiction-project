force to the expansion of its vapour. The sudden vaporization
of a part of the mercury, seems to me a principal cause of this
immense yet limited force; because its limitation may then be
explained, as it is well known that mercury easily parts with -
caloric, and requires a temperature of 600 degrees of FAURENHEIT, .
to be maintained in the vaporous state. "That the mercury is
really converted into vapour, by ignition of the powder, may be
inferred from the thin coat of divided quicksilver, which, after
the explosion in the glass globe, covered its interior surface; |
and likewise from the quicksilver with which a tallow candle,

or a piece of gold, may be evenly coated, by being held at a |
small distance from the inflamed powder. These facts certainly
render it more than probable, although they do not demonstrate, |
that the mercury is volatilized; because it is not unlikely that |
many mercurial particles are mechanically impelled against the

surface of the glass, the gold, and the tallow.

As to the force of dilated mercury, Mr. BauME' relates a
remarkable instance of it, as follows.
