Instead of this, the slide was taken to a place where it could be
illuminated by strong daylight, and the exposure given to the sensitive photographic
plate was of course correspondingly increased. Zine templates of the shapes required
were made, and by placing the template on the wax, the outline was cut with a
sharp knife, and the particular well thus formed. In cases where the flow in the
well was very slow, air bubbles became imprisoned, and could only be removed after
great difficulty ; in fact, in one or two cases—as will be seen in the photographs, figs,
31 and 32 (Plate 19)—they could not be removed at all. Secrron IT. (a)
