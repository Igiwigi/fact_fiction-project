The following Table includes species collected by Mr. Honrrum and myself in 1921,
and some of HErER’s species which I have examined. Herr’s records are given only for
species which I have seen at Copenhagen or Stockholm. Under Upernivik Island are included all the places where we obtained specimens :
such observations as we made did not enable us to discover any facts in favour of a
geological separation of the plant-bearing beds. Heer allocates all the plants from
Upernivik Island to his Atane, or middle, series. The plant beds on the North coast of the Nigssuak peninsula are assigned by HEER
to his Kome series, the lowest member of his Greenland group.
