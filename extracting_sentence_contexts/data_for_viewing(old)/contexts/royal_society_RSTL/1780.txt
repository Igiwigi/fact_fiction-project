and leave it until early in the morning. At 7 o'clock a.m. the beat of both
sides of the heart still continued. They till continued to move at 10 a.m.,
each auricle and each ventricle contracting quite distinctly. At half after
11 a.M. all were equally motionless ; yet all equally contracted on being sti-
mulated by the point of a penknife. At noon the two ventricles were alike
unmoyed on being irritated as before ; but both auricles contracted. Both
auricles and ventricles were shortly afterwards inirritable.

This experiment is the most extraordinary of those which have been per-
formed upon the mammalia. It proyes several interesting and important
points : 1. That the irritability of the heart is augmented in continued lethargy
in an extraordinary degree. 2. That the irritability of the left side of the
heart is then little, if at all, less irritable than the right, â€”that it is, in fact,
veno-contractile. 3. That, in this condition of the animal system, the action

of the heart continues for a considerable period independently of the brain
and spinal marrow.

On April the 20th, at six o'clock in the evening, the temperature of the atmo-
sphere being 53?, a comparative experiment was made upon a hedgehog in its
state of activity : the spinal marrow was simply divided at the occiput ; the
beat of the right ventricle continued upwards of two hours, that of the left
