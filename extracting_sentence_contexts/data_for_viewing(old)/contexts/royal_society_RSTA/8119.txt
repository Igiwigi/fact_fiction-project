iD (i a a -p)
and it will be seen that this quantity, other things being equal, increases with decreases
in T and in p. The experimentally derived value of 8, assuming the law of direct
proportionality to hold, is known in closed vessel observations to increase with increase
of propellant size and with decrease in the density of loading, in both of which cases the
mean value of T decreases.

The occurrence of the term (T, —T,) in the denominator of B is in accordance with

the known fact that the rate of burning increases with T,}; if T,, closely approaches
T, a small amount of incident energy only is required to cause breakdown.t It will

be shown later that & increases more rapidly than would be indicated by a law of
direct proportionality with T,.

Ifl.—Analysis of Closed Vessel Pressure-Time Curves.

The analytical scheme for obtaining numerical values from pressure-time curves
under closed vessel conditions rests basically on equations (5), (7) and (8).

* The consequences of this form as regards the theory of burning in the gun have been investigated by
Cremmow, ‘ Phil. Trans,,” A, vol. 227, pp. 345-382 (1928).
