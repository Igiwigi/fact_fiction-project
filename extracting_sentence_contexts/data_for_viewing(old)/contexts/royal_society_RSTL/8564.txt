a similar effect. It cannot be reasonably argued that a ray of light, filtered through
Plates of glass and alum (109), can instantly vaporize a film of moisture or condensable
gas from a surface on which it is caused to shine, or that it can produce air-currents in
the almost perfect yacuum surrounding the surface shone upon, or that it will produce
electrical excitement on such a surface.

124. Facts tested and verified by numerous experiments, but scarcely more than
touched upon in the present paper, are, I think, gradually shaping themselyes in order,
in my mind, and will, 1 hope, aid me in evolving a theory which will account for all the
phenomena. But I wish to avoid giving any theory on the subject until T have accu-
mulated a sufficient number of these facts. The facts will then tell their own tale ; the
conditions under which they invariably occur will give the laws; and the theory will
follow without much difficulty. In the eloquent words of Sir Huxeary Davy, © When
I consider the yariety of theories which may be formed on the slender foundation of
one or two facts, I am convinced that it is the business of the true philosopher to avoid
them altogether. It is more laborious to accumulate facts than to reason concerning

them; but one good experiment is of more yalue than the ingenuity of a brain like
Newrox's.”
