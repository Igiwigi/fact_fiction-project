Fi (S) still drops out of (2.14) because Cw, ¢) Must remain bounded on the jet axis. By considering
the conditions across the surface r = 0 in the i= ¢ component of equation (2.72) and using V.i ~
DoGs = O(e) in the adjoint energy equation, equation (2.7b), it is easy to show that Giro) =O at
lowest order in equation (2.7) [see Afsar et al. [13], for more details]. The final simplification to the analysis comes as a consequence of using Gg =0 in the i=¢
component of (2.7), which recovers the fact that the solution to (2.14) is independent of azimuthal
angle ¢. In other words, the Fourier transform of i(Y, U,¢|X, ®; @) in the difference, (© — ), is
given by

where 6(e) is the Dirac delta function of argument (e). Using (2.6), the solution, »(Y, U), is therefore
