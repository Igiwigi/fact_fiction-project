In R. circularis, on the other hand,
alveoli are never developed ; at the most a few short blunt processes (figs. 3 and 4, p,)
are thrown out from the outer surface of the cortex, more especially around the base
of the stem. It is, however, conceivable that in some other species the outer, or
cortical, layer of the cups may develop long complex processes similar to those of Rt.
batis. The gelatinous layer, as already indicated, is comparatively unimportant; it
surrounds the cups (c.t., fig, 5), and fills up the spaces between the stems; it, in fact,
forms a matrix in which the cups are embedded, and in which the blood vessels freely
ramify. One of the capillaries is represented in fig. 5 (c.p.). The capillaries form an
irregular network between and around the cups; but they never appear either to
enter the cups with the nerves or penetrate into the substance of the striated layer
through the cortex.
