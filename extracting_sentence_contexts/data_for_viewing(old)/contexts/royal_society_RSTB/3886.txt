In two of the experiments in which the central segments were the musculo-
cutaneous, median, and ulnar, the preliminary contractions of the muscles were
noted at 96 and 93 days respectively, so that a marked correspondence in these two
experiments was manifested. Also the further course of events showed corre-
spondence, as at 126 and 123 days respectively these animals were able to use the
leg in walking. In the other experiments, in which the musculo-spiral was the
central segment left to supply the entire limb, an earlier appearance of recovery took
place, aninieby, at 81 and 59 days respectively.

From comparison of experiments on nerve crossing with the present series it
has been shown that there is a difference in the dates of recovery in favour of the
former. This is what might be expected in consideration of the fact that it is only
necessary in the case of the former experiments for substitution of one cerebral
centre to be made for another, while in the latter one central segment is removed
altogether, and both sets of muscles supplied through the single central trunk.
There is thus not only a new connection with the centres to be established, but there
is also a reduction of the total volume of the nerves supplying the entire musculature
of the limb. In the nerve crossing series the total volume of nerve supply remained
