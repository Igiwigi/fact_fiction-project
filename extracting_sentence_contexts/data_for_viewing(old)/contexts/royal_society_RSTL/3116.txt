as by connection with a Leyden jar, and examined by a carrier ball, readily gaye elec-
tricity at the lowest part of their concavity if in a room ; but I was in hopes of finding
that, cireumstanced as before stated, they would give little or none at the same spot,
if the atmosphere above really terminated in a vacuum. I was disappointed in the
conclusion, for I obtained as much electricity there as before; but on discovering
the action of induction in curved lines (1231.), found a full and satisfactory explana-
tion of the result.

1615. My theory, as far as I have yentured it, does not pretend to decide upon the
consequences of a vacuum. It is not at present limited sufficiently, or rendered pre-
cise enough, either by experiments relating to spaces yoid of matter, or those of other
kinds, to indicate what would happen in the vacuum case. I have only as yet en-
deavoured to establish, what all the facts seem to prove, that when electrical phe-
nomena, as those of induction, conduction, insulation and discharge occur, they de-
pend on, and are produced by the action of contiguous particles of matter, the next
existing particle being considered as the contiguous one; and [I have further assumed,
that these particles are polarized ; that each exhibits the two forces, or the force in
two directions (1295. 1298.) ; and that they act at a distance only by acting on the
contiguous and intermediate particles.

1616. But assuming that a perfect vacuum were to intervene in the course of the
lines of inductive action (1304.), it does not follow from this theory, that the particles
on opposite sides of such a vacuum could not act on each other. Suppose it possible
for a positively electrified particle to be in the centre of a yacuum an inch in diameter,
nothing in my present views forbids that the particle should act at the distance of half
