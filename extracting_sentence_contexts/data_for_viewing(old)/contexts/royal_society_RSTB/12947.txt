candidate proteins, it is possible that haem is involved in
transcription through transcription factors, RNA metabolism
through RBDHs and nucleoporins, and epigenetic histone
modification through HDAs in A. thaliana and Cy. merolae.

For transcriptional regulation, haem is known to bind
the transcription factor HAP1 in yeast to mediate oxidative
stress [44]. In mammals, haem also binds to the basic leucine
zipper protein Bach1, which represses genes such as haem oxyge-
nase 1 [45]. Haem also coordinates regulation of metabolism with
the circadian clock via the Rev-erb haem sensors [46]. For haem
binding, a haem-regulatory motif (HRM) is found in bacteria
and eukaryotic systems [47]. In fact, HAP1 and Bach] contain 7
and 6 HRMs, respectively, while Rev-erb binds to haem with
non-classical HRM. In bHLH110 and BOA, we could not detect
any classic HRM, so haem may bind to distinct domains if they
really bind to haem. It is interesting to note that in mammalian
cells, haem biosynthesis is circadian-regulated and several
components including Rev-erb bind haem [46]. In tobacco, the
FC activity is inversely regulated with that of Mg-chelatase
during cyclic photoperiods [48], but the involvement of haem
in circadian regulation is totally unknown in plants and algae.

For RNA metabolism, haem is known to bind the haem-
binding protein DGCR8 (DiGeorge critical region-8), which is
