292 DR. MARIA M. OGILVIE ON THE MICROSCOPIC AND

A comparison of the septal pairs with the “ embryonic pairs ” of mesenteries drawn
in diagrams A and B shows very clearly that there were types (and they were very
numerously represented) still existing in Jurassic seas, in which the slow, paired
mode of septal development was adhered to (cf. pp. 280-283). The same types counted
usually eight, ten, or twelve septa in their so-called primary cycle; if eight, the
arrangement was bilateral ; if ten or twelve, it might still be bilateral, but showed a
tendency to be practically radial. From these facts, together with the known facts
of embryology, it will be admitted to be pretty well proved that the sub-orders
Tetracoralla and Hexacoralla are based on a feature which became gradually in the
course of time removed backward in the life-history of the individual until now it is
presented only in embryonic stages. The diagram of the recent polyp Seriatopora
shows twelve septa bilaterally arranged, correlated with the retention of the primi-
tive feature of a pair of fossule, I have entered the numerals against the mesen-
teries in diagram E according to the same system followed in diagrams A to D, for
the purpose of demonstrating the upholding of the significance of the ‘‘ embryonic
pairs ” in this Recent coral.
