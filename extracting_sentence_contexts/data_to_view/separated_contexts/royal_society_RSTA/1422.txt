The ideal, most favourable, situation in which the full system’s state is
observed in the reduced space with no error is referred to as the ‘perfect observation’ case: yx = xx. For convenience, we further assume that observations are available regularly at multiples of the
model time step such that At = ty, — tk = N;ét, Nc € N*. This also accounts for the fact that, in
general, the observation sampling period is longer than the integration time step of the numerical
model.

3. Method

(a) Loss function approximation

Let us assume that an estimation of x, (k € {0,...,K}) is available at observation times, every At =
N,ét, so that

Xpp1 = IT o MN (24, 58), (3.1)

where M2) is the composition of the model N, times, and similarly for the truncated model,
Xiu = MWS) (xp, St). Since observations are not available at each time step (Nc > 1), the model
error €™ is not known at each time step either, and the loss function equation (2.7) cannot be
exactly computed.
