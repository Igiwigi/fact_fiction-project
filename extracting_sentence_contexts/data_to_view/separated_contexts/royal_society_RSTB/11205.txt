However, further research complicates this picture. One
issue is that few such effects are strongly automatic, in the
sense of occurring when participants engage in a simple
reading or a lexical decision task. In fact, in order to find
valence-space congruency effects, participants must usually
be focused on processing valence [75]. One exception is
words referring to emotions that are experientially tied to
spatially specific body postures (e.g. happiness goes with
an upright posture, whereas sadness tends to go with a
slouched posture). Consistent with this idea, relevant
emotion words seem to automatically activate vertical space
(happy — up; sad — down), even in a shallow task that
does not require valence judgement, (e.g. responding to ink
colour with an up versus downwards directed movement)
[76].
