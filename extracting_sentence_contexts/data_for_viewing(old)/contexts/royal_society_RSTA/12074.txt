rapidity with which the changes takes place it is highly important to catch the exact
moment when the blast should be turned off. The colour and brightness of the
stream of gas issuing from the converter when observed by an experienced eye,
generally give a sufficient indication, but when pig iron of a highly manganiferous
character is used, this determination is very difficult ; even those who had had much
experience made frequent mistakes, and found it impossible to produce the same
quality of metal at every operation.

Mr. Rowan, of the Atlas Works, Sheffield, made use of coloured glasses, two of
ultramarine blue and one of dark yellow, by which the eye was greatly assisted and
the termination of the process rendered unmistakeable.

Though Lrexxae first recognised the fact that the spectrum of the Bessemer flame
was not the spectrum of carbon, nor entirely that of carbonic oxide, which gives a
continuous spectrum, it was Brunner in 1868 who first expressed the view that the

spectroscope cannot be considered as a practical indicator of the decarburization in the
Bessemer process, because the lines of the Bessemer spectrum do not belong to
carbonic oxide or to carbon, but to manganese and other elements in the pig-iron
