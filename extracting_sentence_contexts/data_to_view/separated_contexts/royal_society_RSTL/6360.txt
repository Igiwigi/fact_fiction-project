Matter in the following words, that when the particles of crystalline solids* © con-
solidate under-the-influence of heat in motion, their crystals arrange and group them-
.selves with their principal axes in lines perpendicular to the cooling or heating surfaces
of the solid—that is, in the lines of direction of the heat-wave in motion, which is the
direction of least pressure within the mass.”

1t is scarcely necessary to add that there is no resemblance in this molecular arrange-
ment to that of a 8mall speculum cooled instantaneously. Enough has now been 8aid to enable a skilful founder to follow the course which we
pursued in casting -specula of 6-feet aperture. The principles are, in fact, the same

which he must have had in view in executing works of unusnal difficulty in cast iron :
with speculum-metal, however, the difficulties are far greater, and therefore every part
of the operation must be more rigorously governed by sound principles. The photograph of the speculum on its supporting levers (Plate XXIV. fig. 1) will
give perhaps all the information which may be required as to the general nature of tho
arrangement. "The ring in-which the speculum is suspended was removed, as also some
of the apparatus connected with the levers, to prevent confusion. The diagram fig. 2
represents in -plan the -arrangement of the levers.
