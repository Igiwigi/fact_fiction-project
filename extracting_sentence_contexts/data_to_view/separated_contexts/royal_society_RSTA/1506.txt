Various explanations might be given of this clearly-established
parallelism. hus, if the systematic errors were greater than the casual errors, both
formule would show a run of predominantly positive or predominantly negative errors. But in the “ quartz ” series, where the casual errors were much larger than in the “ glass ”
series, this explanation could not be maintained, in view of the fact that the sign of these
concordant errors often showed an abrupt reversal. On further investigation, this
reversal was traced in some instances to the presence of recorded satellites, positive errors
being shown by lines with a satellite of shorter wave-length and conversely. ‘This
discovery affords a possible explanation of the very baflling fact that the differences
between the observed and calculated rotations were often much larger than the probable
error of the rotations, or than any conceivable error of the wave-lengths.
