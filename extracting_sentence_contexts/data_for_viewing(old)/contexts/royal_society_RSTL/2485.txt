be regarded as the perfect type to which all the others are to be referred (fig. 5.).

In the whole of this tribe of the Cirripedes, the ova, after expulsion from the ova-
rium, appear to be conveyed by the ovipositor into the cellular texture of the pedicle,
just beneath the body of the animal, which they fill to the distance of about an
