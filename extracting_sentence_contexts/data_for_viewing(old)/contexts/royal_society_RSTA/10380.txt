Tv seems likely to be of interest at the present time to consider rather at length a
fairly full mathematical theory of the pure gamete. We do not venture to call this
theory a generalised Mendelian theory of inheritance, partly because it is not even the
most general theory of the pure gamete conceivable, partly because MeNDEL’s original
theory of heredity was perfectly clear and perfectly simple, and is not the theory here
developed. The pure and simple Mendelian theory seems to have been discarded in
the light of recent experimental results by more than one Mendelian, both in this
country and abroad, The original Mendelian theory has been replaced by what are
termed ‘‘ Mendelian Principles.” In this aspect of investigation the fundamental
principles propounded by MENDEL are given up, and for each individual case a pure
gamete formula of one kind or another is suggested as describing the facts.t This
formula is then emphasised, modified or discarded, according as it fits well, badly, or
not at all with the growing mass of experimental data.

It is quite clear that it is impossible while this process is going on to term
anything whatever Mendelian as far as theory is concerned, The present investigation
is therefore not a generalised Mendelian theory of heredity : we speak of it merely
as a generalised theory of alternative inheritance, and it is based on the conception
that the gamete remains pure, and that the gametes of two groups, while they may
link up to form a complete zygote, do not thereby absolutely fuse and lose their

of the simpler special cases and who placed his results entirely at my disposal.
