AWjrrev,
within the time period t satisfies the following time-energy uncertainty relation

AWirreyT 2 Mprocess- (1.1)

The total work lost irreversibly would then be AWirrey = Nf AWirrey, where N is the number of
particles and f the number of particle degrees of freedom, and Mprocess > 0 is a process-dependent
constant that has the dimension of an action. The value of the constant Itprocess depends on the
physical scale of the process. As will be shown, Nprocess is essentially bounded from below by
Planckâ€™s constant, which makes a surprising parallel to the Heisenberg time-energy uncertainty
relation, despite the fact that both uncertainty relations have very different conceptual origins. It
should perhaps be noted that in our reasoning we do not use any quantum mechanical but purely
classical mechanical considerations. Aforementioned uncertainty relation allows one to regain an intuition that seems to have
vanished from classical equilibrium thermodynamics.
