system or global civilization, are known to be prone to surprises, such as unexpectedly large
effects of small changes to seemingly insignificant variables on system behaviour. The potential
for future surprise is particularly large in systems in which surprises have arisen in the past. Both
the climate system (e.g. Dansgaard—Oeschger events revealing profound instability in the climate
of the Last Glacial period [36]) and civilizations [25] are complex systems that are known for
their history of surprises. Finally, the risk of surprises increases if complex systems are driven
outside the conditions in which they have been operating in the past. As Bentley & O’Brien
[27] showed, current civilizations are changing more rapidly than ever before. Current climate
change is putting the Earth system outside the parameters of the last two millennia (e.g. [37]). Two
mutually interacting complex systems are driven beyond their traditional operating parameters.

The risk of discovering some of the unknown unknowns in those complex systems therefore
cannot be ignored—and the fact that we can recognize that risk attests to the fact that even
unknown unknowns need not be entirely unknowable.

In summary, the articles by Freeman et al., Kennett & Marwan, Bentley & O’Brien and
Parker & Risbey show how various forms of uncertainty can nonetheless provide constraints on



recommended future actions—and hence how actionable knowledge can arise from uncertainty. ls |
We find it particularly notable that a more compelling case for climate mitigation can be made
based on an increase in uncertainty (Freeman et al.), and even based on the recognition of “3
unknown unknowns (Parker & Risbey). :
Two other articles provide a detailed quantitative analysis of the implications of uncertainty
