The septum lucidum was uninjured.

The rest of the brain was intact.

An analysis of these three experiments elicits, with individual differences, certain
common and fundamental facts. They show conclusively that an animal deprived of
its frontal lobes retains all its powers of voluntary motion unimpaired, and that it con-
tinnes to see, hear, smell, and taste, and to perceive and localize tactile impressions as
before. It retains its instincts of self-preservation, retains its appetites, and continues
to seek its food. Tt is also capable of exhibiting various emotions. The result, therefore,
is almost negative, and the removal of a part of the brain which gives no external response
to electric stimulation exercises no striking positive effect; and yet the facts seem to
warrant the conclusion that a decided change is produced in the animal's character and
disposition. For this operation I elected the most active, lively, and intelligent animals
which I could obtain. 'To one seeing the animals after the removal of their frontal
lobes little effect might be perceptible, and beyond some dulness and inactivity they
might seem fairly up to the average of monkey intelligence. They seemed to me, after
having studied their character carefully before and after the operation, to have under-
gone a great change. While conscious of sensory impressions, and retaining voluntary
power, they, instead of being actively interested in their surroundings, ceased to exhibit
