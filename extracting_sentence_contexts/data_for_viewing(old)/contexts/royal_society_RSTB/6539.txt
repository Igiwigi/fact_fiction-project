significance of this intimate association of the spiracular diverticula with the gonadal
mesoderm has been discussed by LEHMANN (1925) and RippER (1931). They
homologize this condition with the development of the nephromixis (vide GoopricH,

1895) in Peripatus (KENNEL, 1885 ; GLEN, 1919), the only difference being that in
insects no actual connexion obtains between the cavity of the gonads and the
ectodermal diverticulum. The condition obtaining in Locusta supports this view.
However, it is important to point out here that the mere fact of the spiracular
invagination touching the mesoderm is by itself of no importance since, by the very
nature of its position, the ectodermal invagination is bound to come in contact with '
the mesoderm, as happens not only in the anterior abdominal but also in the thoracic
segments. Therefore, the conclusions of LEHMANN (1925), based on the condition
in Carausius, were perhaps premature and indeed unjustified. But when we now
view them in the light of the condition in Locusta, where a truly intimate association
obtains between the spiracular invagination and the mesoderm, they become
significant.
