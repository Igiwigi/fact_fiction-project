The structure may in these cases be so minute, that
fluid wax cannot be forced into the grooves or depressions ;
and we have an approach to this delicacy of conformation in
some specimens of mother of pearl, where the grooves cannot
be seen by the most powerful microscopes. 4+ Since a particular structure of surſace is always accompa-
nied with a new repulsive force, residing nearer the body
than the common repulsive force which produces ordinary
reflection, may there not reside also, near the surface of all
crystallisxed bodies, a new refractive force which produces
double refraction? And is not this supposition countenanced by
the fact, that the extraordinary pencil formed by Iceland spar
suffers the ordinary as well as the extraordinary refraction ? I shall now conclude this section with a few remarks on
the crimson and green light which always accompanies the
primary coloured image. This mass of light is never pro-
duced by the wax, and as it appears, even when the rays are
