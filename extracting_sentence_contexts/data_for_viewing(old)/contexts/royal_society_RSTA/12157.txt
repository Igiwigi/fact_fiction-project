80. But these conditions are not sufficient to insure that the elasticity shall
be purely rotational, and in no wise distortional. For example, as may be seen
from the above, the elasticities of Lord Ketviy’s labile elastic-solid sether and of
Green’s incompressible zether satisfy them. What is required is that for any dis-
ement of a given portion of the medium, the total work done by both the bodily
forcive and the surface tractions shall be expressible in terms of the rotations of its
elementary parts alone. In the particular case in which the medium is in internal
equilibrium in a state of strain, the part of this work which is due to bodily forcive is
” course null; so that the surface-tractions are then all-important.

81. Now let us examine a form of Wg, the dispersional part of the energy, which
Shas been put forward by MacCunxaan solely in order to explain the fact that the
Peharacter of the crystalline wave-surface is not altered by the dispersional energy.

He assumes that W, is a function of (f, g, h) and of its vorticity or curl, and of
the curl of that curl, say its curl squared, and so on; and he observes that if this
‘quadratic function only involve squares and products of the respective components of
pal powers of the curl, FREsNEL’s wave-surface is unaltered, while if even powers
Scome in, the surface is modified in a simple and definite manner ;* it will be clear on
Bonsideration that if an odd power of the operator is combined with an even power,
gin any term, rotational quality of the medium must be introduced. It will be

Asufficient for practical applications to attend to the dispersional terms of lowest order.
