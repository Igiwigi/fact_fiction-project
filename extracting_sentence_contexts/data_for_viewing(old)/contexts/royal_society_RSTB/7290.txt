elucidating the fundamental laws governing the behaviour of tissue transplants and con-
tributing to the ultimate solution of the clinical problem of obtaining functioning homo-
transplants of endocrine tissues for the treatment of such diseases as myxoedema, Addisonâ€™s
disease, and diabetes mellitus. It was, therefore, decided to work with transplants of an
endocrine tissue despite the increased complexity which this would entail. As a result two
groups of factors have had to be kept in mind, namely, immunological factors concerned
with the behaviour of homotransplants in general and endocrinological factors concerned
with the behaviour of transplants of endocrine tissue, whether auto-transplants or
homo-transplants.

In planning new experiments it has been considered desirable to take account of the
literature relating to the transplantation of embryonic and neoplastic as well as normal
tissues. The relevant facts which have so far been established may be summarized as
follows:

1. Autotransplants

Autotransplants (i.e. transplants to a new site in the same individual) of a wide variety
of tissues commonly survive, and in many instances function.

Jaffe & Plavska (1926) obtained functioning subfascial autotransplants of suprarenal
cortical tissue in rats and guinea-pigs, Loeb (1930) demonstrated that autotransplants of
