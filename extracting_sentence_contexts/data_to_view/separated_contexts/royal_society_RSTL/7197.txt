under a layer of paraffin at 100* C. Much chloride of methyl is given off, and a thick
oily mass separates out on cooling, and when no further quantity is formed the reaction
may be considered finished®.
'The reaction which takes place may be written thus—
C,, Hz, N O;+2H Cl=C,, Hz, N O,+2CH, Cl. ; To purify the chloride, and to obtain the base from. it, advantage is taken of the fact
that it is comparatively insoluble in dilute hydrochloric acid, whereas in strong hydro-
chloric acid as well as in pure water it dissolves readily. After the reaction is finighed
the contents of the flask are allowed to. cool..
