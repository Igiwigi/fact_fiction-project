The remaining Ferns, including the Schizeacez,
Gleicheniacese, Osmundacex, Marattiacese, and Ophioglossaceze, he grouped under
the name ‘“ Osmundales,” and notes (/oc. cit., p. 5) that in them no receptacle is
present. He remarks further on (Joc. cit., p. 14), “I cannot simply recognise in this
organ the expression of a perfect arrangement to meet physiological ends; if this
were the case, one would expect a certain relation to the number or size of the
sporangia in a single sorus ; one could not then see why the large sori of the Marat-
tiacewe are without this organ, while the small sori of many species of Microlepia or of
Nephrodium have this organ, These facts indicate conclusively that this receptacle
is a peculiarity of the Pteridales. I must assume that its absepce in a large number
of Polypodiacese is due to its being abortive in them; I am impelled to this view by
the circumstance that those Polypodiaceze which have a receptacle are in all points
directly allied with the Cyatheaces.” After limiting his use of the term receptacle
to those cases where there is a special development of tracheides, he continues that
such a receptacle occurs in the genera Dennstedtia, Microlepia, Leptolepia, and
Hypolepis, which were grouped as Microlepiex by Kuny, and also in Saccoloma,
Aspidium, Oleandra, Nephrolepis, Nephrodium, Onoclea, Woodsia, Acrophorus,
Cystopteris, and Athyrium.
