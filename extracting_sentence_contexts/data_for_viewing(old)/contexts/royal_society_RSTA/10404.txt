of particle, as determined from the 6th and 8th or from the 7th and 9th columns of
that table, is smaller than for the glasses F, G, H, which show the regular pink
colour. For the glasses A to E this number is greatest for the glasses Ce and E, of
which the former and parts of the latter do show the regular pink colour.

Even glasses which do not satisfy the condition of many particles to a wave-length,
and which consequently do not exhibit the “regular” (pink) colour of gold glass,
have many of their properties co-ordinated by the results we have obtained for
regular glasses.

Take, for instance, the glasses A and B (Table II.). Comparison of the gold
content j with the size of the observed particles shows that those particles at any
rate are so far apart as not to satisfy our condition. The fact that glass A is
colourless shows that if there are also minute spheres present which escaped
observation, they also lie so far apart as not to be many to a wave-length. On the
other hand the pink colour of glass B suggests the presence of minute unobserved
spheres which are sufficiently close together to satisfy our condition, the absorption
of the glass being proportional to that small part of the gold content (4) which is
associated with the minute spheres.

In both glasses the large particles reflect much more light than is emitted by the
minute spheres. The colour of this reflected light is the usual yellow-red metallic
reflection from gold. Therefore the colour of the cone of light should be gold-
yellow (i).
