The Gland-vesicles —The gland-vesicles (Driisenbl&schen, K6LKER) of the thyroid
gland are described as closed globular bodies, consisting of a very fine homogeneous
membrane (membrana propria) lined by a single layer of epithelial cells (Kors,
HexLs, Vers0N). Frey, on the contrary, does not believe in the presence of a mem-
brana propria. We thinks that the connective-tissue wall of denser texture, when
examined with imperfect methods of preparation, may have deceived earlier observers.
Authors differ in their description of the epithelial cells. HexLe describes them as a
single layer of flattened cells containing circular nuclei, and resembling a layer of
epithelium. According to K6LKER they are polygonal, finely granular, transparent
cells, each with a single nucleus. Frey, again, alludes to them as flattened, cylin-
Arical, nucleated cells. Finally, VeRsoxN, in opposition to HENLE, lays stress on the fact
that the cells in the fresh condition are always somewhat higher than broad. Accurate
measurements of the gland-vesicles and of the epithelial cells are given by the different
authors, into a consideration of which it is needless to enter here.

The cavity of the vesicle is described as occupied by a clear yiscid fluid (Korner
and Frey) slightly tinged with yellow, and containing much albumin (Ko11axes).
HexLE speaks of the contents as clear, and becoming converted by the action of alcohol
into a firm, somewhat shrunken coagulum.

These authors all allude to the occurrence of a colloid material in the vesicles, which
they consider a pathological condition. K6L11KER, however, found it in new-born
children, and VERS0N © at an adyanced age.”
