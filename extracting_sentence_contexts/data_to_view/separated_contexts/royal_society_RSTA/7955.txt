+ These curves have been drawn so as to lie evenly about the observational points. Theoretically, the
curves should be hyperbolas on the assumption of uniform movements of the clouds. They are in fact
very flat hyperbolas almost coinciding with the asymptotes,


ELECTRIC FIELD OF OVERHEAD THUNDERCLOUDS. 19

It will thus be clear that the thunder-lightning intervals generally support the con-
clusions made regarding the position and movements of the most active region of these
thunderclouds from a study of the electrograms, the charge records, and the pluviograms.

6. The quick-run records of changes in the electric field. As already explained, the changes in the electric field produced by lightning discharges
were obtained by an arrangement similar to that used in the photographic electrograph
except that the “radium collector” was replaced by a small metal sphere having a
diameter of about 8 cm., and a quick-run photographic arrangement was used, the driving
clock producing a movement of 0-5 cm. per minute or more in the photographic
paper, according to the needs of the case.
