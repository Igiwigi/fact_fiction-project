It
will be observed that for a change of character to be possible when the function passes through a phase of equal
roots, it is not enough that there shall exist a group of equal roots r, but there must be an eyen number of
guch roots in the group, and, furthermore, the equal roots must be real; when this last supposition is nob
satisfied, no change in the character of dr will affect the character of 7+dr: an instructive exemplification of
this remark will occur in the sequel.


l AND IMAGINARY ROOTS OF EQUATIONS. 633

(52) If, then, we insulate any portion of facultative space, and in the block 80 ingulated
it is possible to pass from one point to any other—that is to say, if we can draw a con-
tinuous curve of any sort from one point to another without passing out of the block, and
without cutting or touching the plane D=0, then by virtue of the principle Just laid
down, we see that all the points in such block have the same character, and the nature
of the roots will be the same in the infinite number of families, each containing an
infinite number of individuals which the points in that block severally represent. Now
imagine a block taken 80 extensive as to admit of no further augmentation, except
accompanied with a violation of the condition of the capability of free communication
between point and point without cutting or touching the surface D; such a block may
Q be termed a 7egion, and the whole of facultative pace will be capable of snbdivision
© Into a certain number of these regions. This being supposed effected, the character of
Z each region will be known when we know the character of a single point in it; that is
S to ay, every region will have a determinate character of positive, negative, or neuter.
© Tt will presently be shown that the number of such regions is only three(®) (the least
SZ number it could be to meet the three cases of four, two, or no imaginary roots), one
= masculine, one feminine, one neuter; and consequently there will be but three cases to
G Cconsider when the invariantive coordinates J, D, L are given; according as J, D, L
= belong to one or the other of these three regions, the equation to which they belong
S will haye all its roots real, or only one real, or three real and two imaginary. 'The
S origin, it need hardly be added, constitutes a region per 8, in which, 80 to say, the
& Characters of masculine and feminine are blended.
= (53) Let it be observed that we can see & priori that, were it not for the distinction
£ between facultative and non-facultative portions of space, it would be impossible for
= each point corresponding to a given system of invariants to possess an unequiyocal
S Character; for in such case there would necessarily be free continuous communication
— Posible between all the points on each side of D inter 8c, and consequently we should
S be landed in the absurdity of conceiving the general equation of the fifth degree not
£ to admit of division into cases of four, two, or no imaginary roots; D being negative,
S we know, would imply two roots, and not more than two, being imaginary ; and accord-
ingly D positive would imply either that four roots are imaginary or none—not sometimes
one and sometimes the other, but in all cases alike four imaginary, to the exclusion of the
8upposition of the roots being all real, or else of all the roots being real and never four
imaginary, Thus we see that the mere fact of a given system of invariants communi-
cating a definite character to the roots, implies the necessity of the invariants exercising
a restraining action over each other's limits, and that where this restraint does not exist
it is impossible that the character of the roots can be determined by the values of the
invariants.

(®) It is clear from the definition, that a region can only be bounded by G tho amphigenous surface, and D
the plane of the discriminant: and granted (as will be shown hereafter) that G and D touch each other in only
one continuons line, it becomes obvious & priori that there can be but two regions on one side of D and a single

region on the other.


634 PROFESSOR SYLVESTER ON THE REAL

(54) This is precisely what happens in biquadratic equations. In such we know the
fundamental invariants f, s, or, if we please, t, A (where A=&+27F"), are perfectly inde-
pendent and subject to no equation of condition ; 80 that if we consider t, A as the
coordinates of points in a plane, the whole of the plane will be made up of facultative
points. When A is negative, 7. e. for representative points lying on one side of the line
A, it is true we know that there is just one pair of imaginary roots constituting what
may be termed the neuter case ; but when the representative points lie on the other ide
of this plane, they cannot be said to be either masculine or feminine, but will every one
of them possess that epicene character which is peculiar to the origin alone in the cage
of quintic forms.
