ON AN EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION INTO THE FLOW OF MARBLE. 365

solution and redeposition of the minerals which make up the rock. The percolating
waters, it is held, tend to dissolve material at those points where the pressure is
greatest, and to redeposit it where the pressure is wholly or partially relieved ; tke
movements thus being accompanied by a more or less complete recrystallisation of the
whole rock. Moisture would thus be a necessary factor in all rock folding or
contortion, and recrystallisation the essential feature of the phenomenon. The
deformation of a body of dry rock would be impossible: The opinion that water is a
very important, if not an absolutely essential, factor in the folding of rocks was held
by MacCuntocr, Dr La Brcue, and a number of the earlier geologists; who based
their opinions on the fact that rocks are often much softer while they still contain
their quarry water than after they are thoroughly dry, a fact which has been
emphasised by tests of the relative strength of wet and dry rocks recently carried out
at the arsenal at Watertown, Mass.* It is a matter of great difficulty, and, in fact,
in most cases it is quite impossible to decide with certainty upon the relative merits
of these conflicting views from a study of the deformed rocks themselves. Had this
been possible, the controversy would long since have been brought to a close. Her,
however, in his great work on the ‘Mechanism of Mountain Making,’ published
some twenty years since, refers to the very valuable results which might be looked for
in elucidation of these questions from carefully conducted experiments upon the
deformation of rocks under conditions as nearly as possible approximating those which
obtain in the deeper parts of our earth’s crust. He expresses grave doubts, however,
as to the possibility of reproducing the conditions in question.t
