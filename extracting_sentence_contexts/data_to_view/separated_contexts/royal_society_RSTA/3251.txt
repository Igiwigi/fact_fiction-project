For the fit, we used the value of
505 K (sample KMG6-2) as the value for Tg 4. Figure 4 shows the residual plot of the fit. All
glass transition temperatures (Tg, fictive) can be fitted within + 6 K; the â€™ is 0.999. It is ACpB = 1.94 J/(gK) for amorphous water [42]. For the intensity of the glass transition
of the carbonate mixture, we determined AC, 4 = (0.60 + 0.06) J/(gK).
