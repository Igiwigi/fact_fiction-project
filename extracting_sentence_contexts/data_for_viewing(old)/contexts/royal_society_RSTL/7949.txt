dence that these are true intercellular canals (Plate XXTV. fig. 11, e) running from node

nate as cul-de-sacs. Their inner or medullary wall is almost invariably composed of very
narrow elongated cells (fig. 11, 6) with square extremities, being in fact elongated modi-
fications of the ordinary medullary cells. I have not succeeded in discovering any cells
in their peripheral wall; this appears to be composed of the innermost and first formed
barred vessels of the woody wedge (11, g), to which each canal belongs. Their diameter
yaries from -03 to -1 of an inch, their width being uniform throughout their entire
length, except at their extremities, where they rapidly contract until they disappear.

The Bark or Epidermis.—In a lecture delivered before the Royal Institution of Great
Britain (April 16, 1869), Mr. CarruraeRs incidentally mentions that the Calamitean
stem possessed © a thin cortical layer.” IT am not aware, however, that the true bark
has hitherto been either figured or described. 'The discovery by Mr. BuTrerworTn,
of the small stem represented in figures 9 & 10 removes much of the existing obscurity
on this subject. Of all the scores of microscopic sections of stems of which I have
