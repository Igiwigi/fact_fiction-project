gave the same deflection, whether introduced quickly or slowly ; and when the resi-
dual dominant magnet, an iron wire core, and the commutator in its position Â«, b
(2677.) were used, four journeys to and from produced the same effect at the galva-
nometer when the velocities were as 1:5 or even as 1:10.

2682. When a copper, silver, or gold core is employed in place of the iron, the effect
is very different. There is no reason to doubt, that, as regards the core itself, the
8me amount of electricity is thrown into the form of induced circulating currents
within it, by a journey to or from, whether that journey is performed quickly or
slowly : the above experiment (2681.) in fact confirms snch a conclusion. But the
effect which is produced upon the experimental helix is not proportionate to the
whole amount of these currents, but to the maximum intensities to which they rise.
When the core moves slowly, this intensity is small ; when it moves rapidly, it is
great, and necessarily 80, for the same current of electricity has to travel in the two
differing periods of time occupied by the journeys. Hence the quickly moving core
should produce a far higher effect on the experimental helix than the slowly moving
core; and this also I found to be the fact.

2683. The $hort copper core was adjusted to the apparatus, and the machine
worked with its average velocity until forty journeys to and from had been completed ;
the galvanometer needle passed 39? west. Then the machine was worked with a
greater rapidity, also for forty journeys, and the needle passed through 80* or more
