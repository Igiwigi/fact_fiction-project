In polishing large surfaces also there were great and
peculiar difficulties, all the defects having a tendeney to augment rapidly with the
size, and proportionately to impair the defining power. I thought, therefore, that were
it possible to discover means of securing, in the construction of large instruments, the
same excellence of material and accuracy of surface, which on a small scale was at-
tainable hy the processes already published, much would be gained; but even in the
construction of small instruments there was no reason to suppose that the utmost
limits of perfection had already been attained. On the contrary, the unequal per-
formance of specula wrought with the utmost skill by the same hand, and with the
same materials, was a fact which clearly proved that certainty of effect, the usual cha-
racteristic of a perfect mechanical operation, was still to be 8ought for. It was evi-
dent, therefore, that there was ample room for experiment with a prospect of some
suecess. With these views, the first experiments were undertaken : they were on a
small scale, the earliest as far back as 1827, and some account of them appeared at.
the time in Sir David BrxewsTER's Journal for July 1828.
