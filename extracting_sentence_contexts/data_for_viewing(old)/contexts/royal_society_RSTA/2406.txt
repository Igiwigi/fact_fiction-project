subsystem. The analysis we provide in this study focuses on such singular solutions. For the
extensions to small positive €, we refer to other work [59-61].

Remark 2.2. We analyse the dynamics of the network by constructing singular solutions. If
inh is not too large, then f(x,¥) — ginhS}(¥ — Xinh) =0 represents a cubic-shaped curve for each
sy € [0,1]. Let us denote this curve by Cs,; curves Co and C; are shown in figure 3a. The trajectory
for Ej lies on the left/right branches of one of these curves (ch 18) during the silent/active
phase, respectively. Fast jumps between different phases occur when an §; reaches the right
knee of its respective cubic or the effect of inhibition by the J-cell wears off. Similarly, J lies
on the cubic curve determined by its total synaptic input stot, denoted by %,,,, as shown
in figure 3b. Note in figure 3a that the s;=1 nullcline (C;) lies above the s;=0 nullcline
(Co), while in figure 3b, the stot =1 nullcline (7) lies below the sto¢=0 nullcline (J). These
relations result from the fact that the E; receive inhibition from J while J receives excitation
from the E;.

Figure 3. Plots of possible trajectories for (a) E-cells and (6) J-cell in black solid lines. The double arrows on the solid lines
indicate the fast jumps between the silent and active phases. The trajectories shown are for the situation when there is a delay
only in the inhibitory synapse. The points P; and Q; and the construction of this solution are discussed in §3a. (Online version in
