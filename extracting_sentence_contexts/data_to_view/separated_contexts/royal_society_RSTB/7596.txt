Only the River Sherbourne, flowing from
the north-west, lacks flint in its poorly developed terraces, and in this respect resembles
the River Tame to the west of the Warwickshire coalfield. Perhaps the most striking feature of the system of terraces is that their height distribution
is completely at variance with that of the Older Drifts. This arises from the fact (which will
be amplified later) that the Older Drifts fill a pre-glacial valley which slopes down to the
north-east, whereas all the terraces conform with the present Avon in falling in level to the
south-west. This has the effect that the long profile of a terrace such as No. 4 crosses the
plane of the base of the Older Drifts. In the Lower Avon mapped by Dr Tomlinson, No. 4
terrace is scores of feet below the older series, and even at Warwick its top is 40 ft. below
the base of the Baginton-Lillington gravels.
