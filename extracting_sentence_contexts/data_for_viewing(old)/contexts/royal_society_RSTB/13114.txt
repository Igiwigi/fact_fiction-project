in stake instead of being induced by fundamental differences
in the decision-making process [88]. This would be consistent
with Markowitz utility function which supposes risk seeking
for small stakes (peanuts effect) before converting to risk
aversion for higher stakes [112] and is supported by the find-
ing that increasing the relative amount of reward (by
reducing its frequency) decreases risk seeking down to risk
neutrality in monkeys [88,112]. However, risk aversion in
the gain domain (and a reverse pattern in the loss domain:
the reflection effect) has also been observed with small
stakes in description-based decisions in humans [67]. Thus,
available evidence suggests that differences in the size of the
stake cannot fully explain the fact that human description-
based preferences are hardly observed in monkeys.

Finally, another notable difference between human and
monkey experiments is represented by the amount and the
type of training required to perform the task (see figures 2
and 4). In human experiments, task training rarely takes
more than a few minutes (in some extreme cases of descrip-
tion-based paradigms, there is virtually no training: subjects
are just asked to reveal their preferences). On the other side,
monkey experiments require extensive training, in general
spanning several months (usually training takes longer than
the experiment itself). It can be, therefore, argued that their
