whatever of any force directly referable to radiation.

The motion in the light-mill is wholly due to the forces acting between the revolving
mill and its enclosure. It has not been the object of this investigation to find out what
these forces are ; and I must leave it therefore to Professor REyNoLDs to show in how far
the experiments agree with his thepry of the phenomenon. T ought, however, to mention
that on suggesting the experiments described above to him, he at once told me how the
reaction would make itself apparent according to his theory. His predictions haye been
fulfilled throughout. Tt was also through his courtesy that I was enabled to work with
the neat instrument made by Mr. Geis8LER, and T have had his valuable aid throughout
this investigation. |

It is evident that the experiments agree in detail with the fact that two internal
forces exist :—one, X,, independent of the velocity ; the other, —z, F(u), increasing as
the velocity increases and acting in a direction opposite to that of X;. The force acting
on the vessel is the reaction of the force which moyes the mill, and is therefore
expressed by

—X\+#,F(n).

. As long as z, f(t), which vanishes with u, increases, it has not yet arrived at the yalue
given by the equation
—X,+z,7(u)=0.

In that case X, is greater than z, (1) and the vessel will be impelled in the negative
