This fraction comes to be “74 for uni-con-
stant isotropy. If we assume what I have called Love's fixing condition, the shearing deflection
disappears entirely. The true solution shows us, therefore, that it is permissible in this case to use the
double cantilever as an artifice to obtain the solution, provided we adopt, at the
section of fictitious severance, a fixing condition intermediate between those of Love
and pE SAINT-VENANT, but nearer to the latter. In other words, a central isolated
load does actually introduce a sharp bend,

Supported.
