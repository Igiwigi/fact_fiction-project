The tidal currents have been measured at four points across the section in question,
The depths of course are well known and are marked on all charts. The height of the
range of the tide has only been measured at points at, and near the ends of, the
section. The fact that the tidal current moves backwards and forwards in a straight
line and that it is practically uniform across the section, is however a strong reason
for believing that the tidal range decreases uniformly from the Welsh to the Irish

shore. It is worth pointing out, however, that the mean rise and fall of tide across
the section is not a measured quantity; it is a deduction, based on dynamical con-
ceptions it is true, but still a deduction, from the measured amounts of the rise
and fall of tide at each end of the section, and the measured tidal currents across it. The ratio of the amplitudes of the in- and out-going tidal waves was found by this
method to be 20.
