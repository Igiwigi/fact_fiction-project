This is
frustration and there is no unique best choice. With a large number of students,
finding the best compromise is very difficult, indeed in general NP-complete®
(http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/). In fact, the Dean’s problem was first considered in the context of the magnetic
alloys mentioned earlier, as a minimalist model for a so-called ‘spin glass’
(Binder & Young 1986). The original spin glasses are substitutional metallic
alloys such as Auj—z)Fe,, where only the Fe ions carry magnetic moments (or
‘spins’) and, as a function of their separation, their pairwise interactions are a
mixture of ferromagnetic, trying to align the two spins, and antiferromagnetic,
trying to make them point in opposite directions. Experimentally (Mydosh 1995),
these materials were observed to exhibit a phase transition to an unusual state,
with frozen moments but no periodic order—hence, the appellation ‘glass’ by
analogy with amorphous window glass, slow to respond to changes in external
controls, accompanied by non-ergodicity, behaving differently depending on the
order in which external perturbations, such as magnetic field or temperature, are
applied.
