Now, the two organs of the body whose supply of oxygenated blood
cannot be interrupted, even temporarily, without danger to the system are the central
nervous system and the heart. The brain during asphyxia is enormously congested,*
while, by the action of the vagus nerve, the tissue waste of the heart, and, therefore,
the amount of oxygen which it requires, is reduced as low as is compatible with a
continuance of the circulation. This explanation of the changes in the heart and
circulation which take place during asphyxia is teleological, but seems to us so
obvious in view of the facts before us, that we have not hesitated to state it. It is possible that the indigestion and scanty urine in patients suffering from heart-
failure may be, in part, due to the constriction of the walls of the blood-vessels of the
kidneys and digestive tract-—which, as we have seen, takes place so surely in asphyxia
—although it is possible that these phenomena of heart-failure are due exclusively to
the fall of arterial and rise of venous pressures. CONCLUSION.
