The response is
very similar to that in DOO-PPV excited at E > 2Ey (figure 4a), which we interpreted above as
originating from HE-SF. We thus conclude that most triplet excitons in PDA are generated via SF,
and this explains the ultrafast PA triplet formation in this polymer [16]. As a matter of fact, it is
conceivable that the PA from an entangled TT pair is very similar to that of isolated triplet excitons
(S. Mazumdar 2014, personal communication). We therefore believe that the PA band in PDA film
that is formed in the sub-picosecond time domain originates from TT pairs, rather than from
isolated triplet excitons.
