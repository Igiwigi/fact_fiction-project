On boiling an apparently clear ruby fluid for some time, its colour
passed a little towards amethystine, and on boiling a like amethystine fluid, its tint
passed towards blue. The separation of the gold particles was also facilitated, for now
they would settle in three or four days from a fluid which, prior to this operation, would
not have deposited them in an equal degree for weeks. In the case of the ruby fluids
the colour often became more rosy and luminous, and by reflected light the fluid seemed
to have became more turbid, as if the particles had gained in reflective power ; in fact
the boiling often appeared to confer a sort of permanency on the particles in their new
state. When settled, they formed collections looking like little lenses of a deep ruby or
violet colour, at the bottom of the flasks containing the fluid; when all was shaken up
the original fluid was reproduced, and then, by rest, the gold re-settled. This effect could
be obtained repeatedly.
