GARDINER ON THE CONTINUITY OF THE

is insoluble in ammoniacal cupric oxide, and moreover it gives with Chlor. Zinc Tod. not
the customary blue but an intense red-brown coloration. Lastly, the result with
HorMayn's blue appears to point to a protoplasmic character, opposed to which con-
clusion is the fact that it dissolves in 8ulphuric acid. Thus the question appears to
be, whether it is related to protoplasm or to cellulose, or whether it consists of
a modified cellulose basis permeated by a protoplasmic strueture.* This, however,
minute study of development alone can decide, but the point I wish to bring forward
is the fact that it is coloured by dyes which especially stain the protoplasm. There is a curious parallelism in the action of callus towards HoEMANN's blue and
of pit, membrane towards methylene blue, after treatment with the same reagent
(viz. : sulphuric acid) which may perhaps be worth mention.
