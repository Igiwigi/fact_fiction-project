enhanced property. In the context of image denoising and edge preserving, we can cite the famous
Perona & Malik process, based on the so-called diffusion equation which rules the heat transfer
in its anisotropic form [42,43]. Histace & Rousseau have shown that including an optimal noise
intensity inside the function which provides anisotropy allows one to restore images with better
visual interest than those obtained with the classical Peronaâ€”Malik method [13,44]. Therefore, it
is not surprising that noise enhanced image processing goes on to be widely investigated.

(b) Image perception

Image perception is another interesting field which has attracted a considerable attention since
the early days of SR [6,45,46]. In their pioneering work, Simonotto et al. have reported that adding
an appropriate amount of noise to a subthreshold image can enhance its perception through a
simple threshold detector [6]. In fact, they have established that the perceptive contrast threshold
of different subjects can be significantly reduced for an optimal noise level and that shorter
noise correlation times provided the best enhancement. In their psychophysics experiments, noise


was spatially added to the subthreshold image and was not static but rather with temporal
variations. By including such spatio-temporal random contributions, a basic model of a retina,
which takes into account the random sampling by photoreceptors and the involuntary eye tremor
[47], was next introduced and characterized by Zozor et al. [48]. They suggested that before
encoding information in neurons, fluctuations may interfere in the first layer of the retina to
acquire information on the whole image scene while tremors could perform an ensemble average.
However, their study was restricted to the information acquisition by sensors and did not include
the contribution of fluctuations in the neural process to account for the role of saccades in the
