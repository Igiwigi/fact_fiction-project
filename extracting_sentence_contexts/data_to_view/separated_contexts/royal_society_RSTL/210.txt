If, upon that brown oxide, a sufficient quantity of dilute
sulphuric acid is poured, it yields a blue salt, but in a propor-
tion greater, by about 24, per cent. than if the green substance
had been employed. I imagine, therefore, that the first opera-
tion of this brown oxide is, to assume' the quantity of water
necessary to constitute a hydrate; and, that the combination of
sulphuric acid takes place, not between the oxide, but between
the hydrate and that acid, to form a salt, which, when cry-
sStallized, has taken another portion of water 'in the act of
crystallization. It is a well known fact, that there is a state of
concentration, when an aqueous solution of muriate of copper,
gently heated, will change from a bluish green to a beautiful
brown, which, upon cooling, or by the affusion of water, re-
sumes its former tinge. This brown liquor is probably a solu-
tion of muriate of copper; while the blue liquor, like every
green or blue solution of a cupreous salt, is a combination of
the acid and the hydrate, or (as we $hould say in this case)
a muriate of hydrate of copper. It is true, I have not been
able- to produce,  80- often” as I could wish, this change of
colour.
