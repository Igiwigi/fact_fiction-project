found to be considerable. It is to be observed, however, that the electric currents
producing the magnetic variations circulate only in the upper layers of the
atmosphere, where the pressure is too small to affect the barometer; the two

variations have their origin therefore in different layers, which may to some extent
oscillate independently. Though we shall find that the facts may be reconciled with
the simpler supposition of one united oscillation of the whole shell of air, there are
certain difficulties which are most easily explained by assuming possible differences
in phase and amplitude between the upper and lower layers. If the two oscillations
are quite independent, the conducting power depending on the now unknown
amplitude of the periodic motion cannot be calculated, but must still be large, unless
the amplitude reaches a higher order of magnitude than we have any reason to
assume.

The mathematical analysis is simple so long as we take the electric conductivity of
the air to be uniform and constant; but the great ionisation which the theory
demands requires some explanation, and solar radiation suggests itself as a possible
cause. Hence we might expect an increased conducting power in summer and in
