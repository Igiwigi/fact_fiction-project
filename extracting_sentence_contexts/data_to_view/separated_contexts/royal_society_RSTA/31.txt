ridge extraction. A second uses the fact that the STFT of a signal is fully characterized by its
zeros (and then the particular distribution of these zeros for Gaussian noise) to deduce an
algorithm to compute the mode domains. For both techniques, mode reconstruction is then
carried out by simply integrating the information inside these basins of attraction or domains.

]. Introduction

In the signal processing community, the meaning of frequency is well understood, and over
two centuries, we have developed a series of mathematical tools to enable us to analyse signals
in terms of the energy distribution in frequency.
