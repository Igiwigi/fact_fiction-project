I have repeated
this experiment in nearly a pint of the most explosive mixture
of the two gases; they burnt violently within the cylinder,
but, though the upper part became nearly white hot, yet no

explosion was communicated, and it was necessary to with-
draw the cylinder to prevent the brass 'wire from being
melted. These results are best explained by considering the nature of
the flame of combustible bodies, which, in all cases, must be con-
sidered as the combustion of an explosive mizture of inflammable
gas, or vapour and air; for it cannot be regarded as a mere
combustion at the surface of contact of the inflammable matter :
and the fact is proved by holding a taper or a piece of burning
phosphorus within a large flame made by the combustion of
alcohol, the flame of the-candle or of the phosphorus will

appear in the centre of the other flame, proving that there is
oxygene even in its interior part. The heat communicated by flame must depend upon its
mass; this is shown ,by the fact that the top of a slender
cylinder of wire-gauze hardly ever becomes dull red in the‚Äù
experiment on an explosive mixture, whilst in a larger cylin-
der, made of the same material, the central part of the top
800n becomes bright red. A large quantity of cold air thrown
upon a small flame, lowers its heat beyond the explosive
point, and in extinguishing a flame by blowing upon it, the
effect is probably principally produced by this cause, assisted
by a dilution of the explosive mixture. If a piece of wire-gauze sieve is held over a flame of a lamp
or of coal gas, it prevents the flame from passing it, and the
phenomenon is precisely similar to that exhibited by the wire-
gauze cylinders; the air passing through is found very hot,
for it will convert paper into charcoal ; and it is an explosive
mixture, for it will inflame if a lighted taper is presented to
It, but it 1s cooled below the explosive point by passing through
wires even red hot, and by being mixed with a considerable
quantity of air comparatively cold.
