If AB, fig. 3, be a section of the specimen of agate repre-
sented in fig. 1, and mn, op, the direction of the laminz inclined
23 to the surfaces of the plate, rays of light incident in the
direction RS parallel to mn are more copiously transmitted
than when they are incident in any other direction. When the
pencil of light falls in the direction TV, its lustre suffers a
great diminution : the: light gradually assumes a red colour,
and vanishes altogether when the obliquity is considerable.
But if the pencil is incident at the same angle on the opposite
side, as PQ, its lustre suffers very litle diminution, and its
colour is not sensibly altered.

These facts admit, to a certain extent, of an easy explana-
tion if we suppose that the plate of agate consists of lamine
m1, op imperfectly transparent, alternating with laminee ca, ef,
which are more pervious to light, a structure which is indicated
by the.existence of a bright and a nebulous image. In this
case the intensity of the light will obviously be a maximum


transmitted through crystallized Bodies. 195

when the ray RS is parallel to mz, and a ray PQ will, within
certain limits, suffer less' diminution of lustre than a ray TV
falling with the same angle of incidence on the other side
