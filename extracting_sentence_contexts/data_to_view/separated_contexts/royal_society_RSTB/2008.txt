All the elements are small, compared with those of the regular steles ;
the internal tracheides are often quite short, with square ends, and reticulated walls
The secondary wood has broad rays; cambium and phloem are sometimes fairly
preserved (Plate 12, fig. 18). The anomalous strands in Specimen I. (photograph 4) are
more irregular than that figured in detail from Specimen IL. ; thus on one side of the
ring in the former case the secondary wood is undeveloped for some distance, and is
here replaced by an excessive growth of phloem or secondary parenchyma. ,

Longitudinal sections of Specimen I., cut immediately below the transverse section
from which phot. 4 was taken, show that the anomalous strand fused, in the down-
ward direction, with the adjacent normal stele. This fact may have some relation to
the division of the latter about the same point. In other cases also accessory vascular tissues have been found, which sometimes
take the form of irregular bands, and not of closed rings. These anomalous vascular strands are probably best regarded as extrafascicular new
formations, comparable to the cortical bundles of Cyeas, which they much resemble,
or to the irregular strands which sometimes occur in the extrafascicular region of
Mucrozamia.*

We know, from the investigations of Weber and Srerzen, that some Medullose
(c.g., M. stellata, var. gigantea) formed successive extrafascicular zones of wood and
bast outside their stelar system, just as we find in Cycas, Macrozamia, and Encepha-
