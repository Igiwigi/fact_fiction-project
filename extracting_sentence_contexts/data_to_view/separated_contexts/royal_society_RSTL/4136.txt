Although these researches were not rewarded by the discovery of any good examples
of the muscular tunic, arms, &c. of the Cephalopoda, whose hard and durable relics
are scattered in profusion through the strata, there are in the collection my 80n
transmitted to me, a few specimens which present characters hitherto unobserved, or
at least unnoticed, by any author, and which appear to me of sufficient importance to
be placed on record, as interesting additions to our knowledge of the structure of
the animal of the Belemnite. In the following remarks I shall restrict myself to the description of the fossils,
of which accurate figures by Mr. Joseen DixkeL, executed under my immediate
inspection, are subjoined ; and the bearing of the facts described on the still mooted
question as to whether the Belemnotenthis and the Belemnite belong to the same
genus; in other words, whether the soft parts of Cephalopoda found in the Oxford
Clay of Wiltshire, and figured and described by Mr. CyanninG Pearce, Professor
Owex, and Mr. CunxincTon, belong to the Belemnites geologically associated with
them, but with which they have never yet been found in organic connection.
