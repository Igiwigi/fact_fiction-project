question as settled. His main point in favour of the ccelomic origin of the valve
apparatus was that it was continuous with and stained the same as the end sac wall.
But, as was indicated earlier in this discussion in connection with the antennal gland
valve, this is not proof that the valve cells are mesodermal in origin.

With regard to the purely ectodermal type of nephrostome, in those cases in which
the development has been studied, e.g., Polygordius, the nephrostome is formed from
cells forming the tip of an ectodermal ingrowth, the remainder of the ingrowth forming
the duct of the nephridium. In the maxillary gland of the Ostracod the valve cells
and the duct cells are both ectodermal in origin, and hence together might be compared
to the complete nephridium with its nephrostome. But the fact that the valve rudi-
ment arises separately from the rudiment of the duct cells shows clearly that this can-
not be the case. More definite evidence against this comparison is the fact that the
valve arises before the duct. In stage IV the valve rudiment is distinct while there
is still no sign of the rudiment of the duct cells. If then the valve did represent a
nephrostome, the Ostracods would present the anomalous case of the nephrostome
arising before the nephridial duct.

It has already been indicated that, in the opinion of the author, the valve system
should be considered as a specialised part of the endoskeletal system. The fact just
mentioned that the valve arises before the duct, fits in with such a view. Probably
originally the valve cells only supported the base of the end sac just as do those cells
that connect the end sac posteriorly to the endoskeletal plate or like those cells that
support the antennal gland end sac. Later, while retaining their supporting function,
they became incorporated into the excretory mechanism. Whether the junction of the
