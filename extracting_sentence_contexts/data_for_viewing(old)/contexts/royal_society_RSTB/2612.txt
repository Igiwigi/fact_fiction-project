in the interseptal loculi of Fungids and Lophoserids and forming a coalescence of the
adjacent granulate outgrowths. In Eupsammia the invagination does not continue
as in the case of the synapticular “bar” of Fungia in a definite vertical direction,
but ceases after the formation of a single synapticular growth. The next invagination
arises in any direction obliquely to, or rectangularly outwards from, the foregoing.

Certain points of similarity with the Turbinolide.

Curiously enough, another Madreporarian family, apparently remote from the
Eupsammide, has a very similar microscopic septal structure. In the Turbinolide,
the axes of calcification in the median plane of the septum are also very closely set
and the growth-lamelle very smoothly apposed. An important difference however
consists in the fact that a trabecular axis never bends out of the median plane in
Turbinolide. There are therefore no septal granulations into which the axes of
fascicular bundles of fibres bend. When a granulation forms on the septal surface, it
covers a number of small centres of calcification in the median plane, from which
practically parallel-placed fibres pass into the granulation, The fine structure of
smooth-septate Eusmilinge is essentially similar (antea p. 161).

The Turbinolide often resemble Eupsammia in another characteristic, the
coalescence of septa at their inner ends often building a symmetrical figure. The
genus Turbinolia itself shows this feature, and still more the genus Delfocyathus and
other genera belonging to the Trochocyathus group. Such local coalescence can only
be produced by the invagination of a part of the body-wall of the polyp, not in the
direct radial line of the septal invagination, and is therefore homologous with synap-
