the two essential surfaces, it has been proved, that a diminu-
tion of the prismatic angle, will gradually extend the visibility
of the rings, till, even before that angle comes to a vanishing
state, where the prism would be converted into a plain slip of
glass, the rings may be seen in every direction, and at any
elevation of the eye, in which they can be seen, through a slip
of glass such as the objection supposes. As this then has been
proved not only of rings, but of all other possible configura-
tions, that may be caused by the rays of the critically separated
colours, modified by reflection or radiation from curved sur-
faces, it is evident, that an objection which asserts that such
colours cannot be seen, contradicts the plainest and best
established facts.

With regard to the actual course of the rays from the very
moment of their critical separation into colours, till they pro-
duce the required effect, it cannot surely be expected that I
should trace them through a most intricate complication of
reflections from curve to curve, when it has been shown, in
the second part of my paper, that even with streaks, which
