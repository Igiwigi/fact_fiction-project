I lodged in the barracks of a ſenfible gentleman
of Mileto, Don Domenico Acquanetta, who 1s a principal pro-
prietor of this town. . He attended me the next day to the two
tenements, called the Macini and Vaticano, mentioned in the
former part of this letter, and which were ſaid to have changed
their ſituation by the earthquake. The faCt is true, and ecafily
accounted for. Theſe tenements were ſituated in a valley ſur-
rounded by high grounds, and the ſurface of the earth, which
has been remoyed, had been probably long undermined by,
little rivulets, which come from the mountains, and now are
in fall view on the bare ſpot the tenements had deſerted, Theſe
rivulets have a ſufficiently rapid courſe down the valley,
to prove its not- being a perfeCt level as was repreſented.
