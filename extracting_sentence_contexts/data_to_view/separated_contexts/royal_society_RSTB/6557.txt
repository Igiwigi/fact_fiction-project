It is perhaps an expression of the fact that in these cases the unfolding
of the occipital operculum has not progressed as far as it does in more highly developed
brains. It is the difficulty of giving exact definition to the term “* Affenspalte”’
suitable for all cases. The difficulty is lessened by realizing that names cannot
imply all that is involved in the changes which are taking place in this region, or,
in fact, in any region of the brain. (See Kooy, 1921, fig. 22.)

In S.2.R. the sulcus ‘y’ is confluent with the sulcus occipitalis transversus (17);

Q.2788.R. (Plate 30)—The sulcus lunatus is a slightly curved sulcus lying obliquely
across the occipital lobe. The lateral extremity does not recurve to the same
extent as in most of the other brains. The crescent-shaped sulcus is very similar
inform to the type depicted by Kooy in some of the Indonesian brains (his figs. 22,
23, and 31).
