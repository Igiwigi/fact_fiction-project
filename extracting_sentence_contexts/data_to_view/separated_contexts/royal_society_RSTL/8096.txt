e. the spectrum became dimmer, that is, exhibited a tendency to die out. When, however, baric fluoride was examined, a different state of things was observed. Instead of the spectrum becoming more complex it became simpler, exhibiting in fact
only the four longest lines of barium with any degree of distinctness, and these showing
but little brilliancy.

STRONTIUM and MAGNESIUM. Strontium behaved in this particular in the same way as barium did, the falling off of
the lines in the fluoride being very marked. In the case of magnesium (which, as regards
its chloride, bromide, and iodide, followed the behaviour of the alkali metals, to which I
shall immediately refer, rather than that of barium and strontium), the fluoride exhi-
bited the same stubborn resistance to the action of the spark.
