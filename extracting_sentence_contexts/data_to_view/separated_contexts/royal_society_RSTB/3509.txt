96, to extend so far laterally that its outer margin overlaps the inner
limit of the parietal or pericardial ccelom. (4) GENERAL PRESENTATION AND SumMARY oF Features or NEURAL ORGANISA-
TION IN THE “ NeURULAR” SvTaGe IN ORNITHORHYNCHUS. On the basis of the foregoing facts and observations, we believe that it may
be possible to frame the outline of a general conception of the neural organisation of
the cephalic region in Ornithorhynchus. In the stages above treated of, we have been dealing with a neural axis which long
preserves its primitive flattened condition as a neural plate, and is thus quite
uninfluenced by various factors which in other forms complicate the problem of early
brain-development. For not only does the mere transformation of a flattened plate
into a tube itself complicate the investigation of the early structural features, but,
associated with this process, there arise a series of mesodermal differentiations which
more or less directly modify and obscure the fundamental structural arrangements.
