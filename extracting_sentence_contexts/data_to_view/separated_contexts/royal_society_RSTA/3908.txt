On the one hand, modelling living
systems and diseases appears unrealistic; possibly, if we wait a century or two then we may
have assembled all the facts and observations [8]. This is a viewpoint not uncommon in the
life-science community in general and among medical doctors in particular. The idea being
that we need to have ‘all’ the experimental facts on the table before even embarking upon
such an ambitious modelling task. In short, this line of thinking could be one of the reasons
why mathematical modelling is not and has not (yet) become mainstream within medicine
and biology. At the other end of the spectrum, we find the view that modelling biological systems is
relatively speaking straightforward.
