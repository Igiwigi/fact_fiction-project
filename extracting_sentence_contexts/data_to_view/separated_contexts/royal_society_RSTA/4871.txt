Our neglect of the random Frobenius eigenvalues [8s
is also consistent with a commonly held philosophy in the study of moduli spaces, that no natural :3

geometric questions depend on the non-tautological classes (e.g. Vakil [24]). That this heuristic is sensible relies crucially on the fact that there are no random eigenvalues
of large weight, which is a deep fact about the cohomology of moduli spaces of curves conjectured
by Mumford and later proved using topological techniques (see §2 for references). The compactly
supported étale cohomology in high degrees (or equivalently by Poincaré duality and a Betti-
étale comparison isomorphism, the Betti cohomology in low degrees; see theorem 3.3) is spanned
by tautological classes, i.e. classes which arise from algebraic cycles produced by canonical
morphisms between moduli spaces. The prototypical example of such a class is the first Chern
class of the relative dualizing sheaf of the morphism Mg, > Mg,-1 obtained by forgetting one
marked point.
