But from the

range of pressure at the hill and plains' stations given in the Table aboye, it appears that this difference |
pressure at the height of 7000 feet is probably not more than half as great as at the ground surk ce
where the barometric gradient does not exceed 0-1 inch in 800 miles, or 0-012 in 100 miles (sco page
Take the probable error of þ,, then, as -006. Then increasing the yalue of 3, by that amount, the yalue
will be diminished by 0-001, and that of 4, increased by half as much, The error of the results in the mon
of July cannot therefore much exceed this. In January the mean moyement of the air is 80 low that the ern

I should expect that the differences of d, and d, are principally due to the real mean temperature of tho 1

column in most months being somewhat higher than the assumed temperature 5t5, A certain

error must arise also from the fact that tho adopted values of yapour-tension are probably in all cages low
than the real tensions ; but the effect of this cannot be yery great. MR. H.
