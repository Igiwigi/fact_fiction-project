procure a specimen of this mineral, and by the kindness of
my friend, Sir SaMvEL Youxs, (to whom I owe more than
one obligation of this nature) was favoured with one sufficiently
transparent for optical examination. From my observations
on this body, I think I shall be able to demonstrate satisfac-
torily, that the phenomena of the apophyllite depend on a
principle distinct from that which produces the chief part
of the deviation of tints in most crystals with two axes.

The course I propose to pursue is, first, to describe the
phenomena themselves. I shall then show how these phe-
nomena, complicated as they are in appearance, are all redu-
cible to one very simple and general fact; viz, that the axes

of double refraction differ in their position in the same crystal
for the differently coloured rays of the spectrum, being dis-
persed in one plane over an angle more or less considerable,
according to the nature of the substance. In many bodies,
the magnitude of this dispersion of the axes is compara-
tively trifling, while in some, not otherwise remarkable for
