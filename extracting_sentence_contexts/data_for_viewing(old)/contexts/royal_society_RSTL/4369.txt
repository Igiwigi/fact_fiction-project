A little consideration will show that «, represents the number of irreducible integrals
of the degree 7 less the number of linear relations or syzygies between the composite
or non-irreducible integrals of the same degree. In fact the asyzygetic integrals of

the degree 1 are necessarily irreducible, i. e. A,=%,, Represent for a moment the
irreducible integrals of the degree 1 by X, X', &e., then the composite integrals

X?, XX', &ec., the number of which is za(a+1), must be included among the asyzy-
getic integrals of the degree 2; and if the composite integrals in question were asyzy-
getic, there would remain A—Ja(a+1) for the number of irreducible integrals of
the degree 2; but if there exist syzygies between the composite integrals in question,

the number to be subtracted from A, will be A(6+1) less the number of these
