& We have next to consider any other necessary correction for the effect of radiation
= during an experiment. When the current was established at —9 bridge-wire reading,
& the oil had first to rise in temperature, then a gradient established from centre to
§ surface of block and, when the temperature began to rise, the thermometer would

Z undoubtedly lag behind the temperature of the surrounding walls.
2 For these reasons, the time of rising through the first bridge-wire division would

considerably exceed the times of passing over succeeding equal divisions.

It was found that when the temperature had reached the end of the first bridge-
wire division, the conditions had become practically steady, as shown by the fact that
in subsidiary experiments in which the current was switched off at the end of the
first bridge-wire division, the “rise above” was found to be very nearly the same as
when the experiments were completed in the customary manner.

We also investigated, with the smaller currents, the curve showing the rate of rise
of the thermometer throughout this first interval and it appeared that, during the
first half of the time of passing through the interval, the thermometer only rose from
—9 to —8'7 bridge-wire. Consequently, this reading —8°7 bridge-wire may be regarded
as approximately the mean temperature throughout the time of the first interval.
