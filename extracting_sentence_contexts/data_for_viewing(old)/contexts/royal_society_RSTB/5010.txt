in Photo. 20 the course of a uniseriate ray is depicted. They are not diverted to a
perceptible extent, and the only modification that they show is a local increase in the
thin-walled parenchyma. Though the tissues of the horizontal and vertical systems
remain histologically distinct there is certainly every possibility of anastomosis, and no
doubt, on wounding, the resin supply of the one supplements that of the other.
However, that there is normal anastomosis between the horizontal and vertical
systems in the spruce stem we have not been able to demonstrate. Though the material
we studied was carefully embedded in celloidin, the walls of the cells in the region of what
might be the junction point were so thin that they might be broken easily and certain
of the delicate cells pulled away in sectioning. This and the fact that we have
often found the two systems with their cavities separated have made us doubtful as to
the occurrence of normal anastomosis. For example, Photo. 18 (Plate 9) illustrates
a common condition. Here the small horizontal cavity, above, is separated from the
vertical by a long thin cell which is more or less broken towards the right. If natural
anastomosis ever does occur in the stem of the spruce, the habit is certainly not well
established. As will be noted later there is more evidence that it may be present in
the looser tissues of old root, where the cystose character of the canals is less marked.
Though the two systems of the wood seem so persistently distinct, they owe their
origin to a common stimulus, as we shall see later, and their association is not a matter
of chance. In Photos. 15, 16 and 17, three horizontal canals are seen arising from three
vertical, the first two in the first year wood and the third in the second. Not only do the
fusiform rays always originate from the vertical system, but many uniseriate rays also.
