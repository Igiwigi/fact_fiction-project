efficiency charts [1], this is still true given that epitaxially grown GaAs and monocrystalline
Si solar cells [2,3] have the highest efficiencies of all single junction solar cells as shown in
figure 1. What has changed is the ranking among the thin-film technologies that were dominated
by Cu(In,Ga)Se2 [7-9] and CdTe at least from the perspective of record efficiency on the lab
scale. Since 2018, the non-stabilized efficiency records for single junction thin-film solar cells
are held by lead-halide perovskite solar cells [5], despite the fact that these are solution-
processed semiconductors and do not even possess an optimal band gap for single junction
solar cells. The key requirement for achieving efficient photovoltaic power conversion is to combine high
absorption coefficients with long charge-carrier lifetime [10,11]. An obvious problem for assigning
a simple figure of merit to this insight is that the absorption coefficient is a function of energy, so
the magnitude and shape of the absorption coefficient matters.
