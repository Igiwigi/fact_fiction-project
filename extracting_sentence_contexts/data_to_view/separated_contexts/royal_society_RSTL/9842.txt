Is there a
trophic centre for the ventricle which is situated either in the auricles or venous sinus,
upon which both atropin and the vagus act? At present I do not see any absolute
necessity to draw such a conclusion from this action of atropin, and therefore prefer to
leave this question entirely undecided in the hope that further researches may enable
me to come to some definite conclusion upon the matter. In conclusion, I desire again to call attention to the fact that the action of the vagus
upon the muscular tissue of the heart is characterised by two different sets of effects. 1. Diminution of contraction force asgociated with a diminution in the excitability
and a diminution of the tonicity of the cardiac muscle.
