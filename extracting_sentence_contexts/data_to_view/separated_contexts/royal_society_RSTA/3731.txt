Let us now exemplify these four steps by considering the Rayleigh—Plateau instability in
the inviscid limit (Oh <1). Denoting by the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and by 9 its
density, the Ohnesorge number Oh = 1/(,/ py Ro) compares viscous effects and inertial effects. The
Ohnesorge number is in fact the inverse of a Reynolds number where the velocity scale \/y/(pRo)
would be capillary driven. Let us start from the depth-averaged equations governing slender jets
introduced by Eggers & Dupont [17], which express the conservation of mass and momentum in
the inviscid limit:

(1) Denoting R(x, t) the radius of the thread, U(x, t) the mean axial velocity, we write

dR dR 10U

and

in the inviscid limit Oh «1, where « is the total curvature. The domain extends from
—oo to +00 in the streamwise direction and periodic boundary conditions can be
applied.

(2) We outline R = Ro and U= Up as spatially and time-independent base state.
