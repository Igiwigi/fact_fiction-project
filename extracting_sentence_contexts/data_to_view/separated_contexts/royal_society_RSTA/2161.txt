My purpose in this lecture is to call attention to some of the most significant
experimental facts bearing on the nature of the processes resulting in the emission of
; X-rays—dwelling especially on the work I have been able to do in the last few
years. Some of this I indicated in short notices appearing in ‘ Nature ’* at the
beginning of last year, but the communications were too brief, perhaps, to be fully
intelligible. Although the war has naturally retarded the work since then, certain
facts have been established sufficiently conclusively, and, what is important, are
sufficiently simple in themselves, to justify a further and more complete announce-
ment. And though the theory put forward will provide subjects for investigation for
some years to come, much might be lost by waiting for more complete evidence. I therefore propose to give in outline the experimental basis for this theory.
