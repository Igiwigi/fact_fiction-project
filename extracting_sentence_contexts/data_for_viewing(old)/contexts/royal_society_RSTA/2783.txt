Freedom of speech and expression is a fundamental right under Indian constitutional law.* The
Supreme Court of India has repeatedly relied on it as an integral part of democracy, and has
also found that this freedom includes the right to know. Freedom of expression is profoundly
impacted by AI, given the increasing reliance on these systems for moderation of content online,
and increasing use of AI applications in everyday life, from smart assistants to autocorrect
technology on mobile devices [54].

Al is offered by both technology companies and governments as a panacea [61] to complex
problems like hate speech, violent extremism and misinformation online [62]. This is a dangerous
trend, given the limited competence of machine learning to understand tone and context.
Automated content removal risks over-broad censorship and take-down of legitimate speech,
and this risk is made even more pronounced by the fact that it occurs unilaterally by private
companies, sometimes acting on governmental instruction.

Surveillance driven by AI technologies, while having the obvious implications for privacy
discussed above, also impacts freedom of expression. By blurring the lines between the private
and the public, Al-driven surveillance has a chilling effect on expression, where self-censorship
is widely adopted by individuals who are unsure of the status and implications of their speech.
