In general, LI does not establish cause-and-effect relationships [28,35], although
rational reasoning about these relations should comply with the rules of LI. Furthermore,
a derivation of a quantum theoretical description from LI principles does not prohibit the
construction of cause-and-effect mechanisms that create the impression that these mechanisms
produce data that can be described by quantum theory [36,37]. In fact, there is a substantial body
of work demonstrating that it is indeed possible to construct simulation models which reproduce,
on an event-by-event basis, the results of interference/entanglement/uncertainty experiments
with single photons/neutrons [38-42]. This demonstration does not imply the reality of hidden
variables or something like that. The LI approach which we review here leads to the view that quantum theory is a
phenomenological theory which can be derived from a set of simple general principles, not
axioms, in a way that is independent of any (strictly speaking, unknown) ‘more microscopic’
level of description.
