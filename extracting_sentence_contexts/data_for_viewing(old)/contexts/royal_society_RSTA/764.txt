that have similar reflectance spectra as angrites are limited to bodies with radii of less than
34 km [75]; therefore the main parent body has not been observed or the APB is extremely small.
Accretion and melting models suggest that melting could occur in parent asteroids as small as
approximately 60 km in radius, if the APB accreted within the first approximately 2 Myr of Solar
System history [76]. Some have suggested that the APB was a major body in the early Solar
System based on the metamorphic history of plutonic angrites [77,78]. A quantitative estimate
of the minimum size of the APB can be inferred from the fact that gravity was strong enough
on the APB for basalts to be preserved and not lost to space during eruption and degassing
[44,79,80]. Previous studies of igneous meteorite groups that lack basalts, e.g. aubrites, ureilites
and acapulcolites, concluded that these were derived from parent bodies that probably had a
radius smaller than 100 km if the parental liquids of the basalts had at least hundreds of pg g~!
volatiles [44,79,80]. Following the same logic, the APB must have had a radius more than 100
km because basalts were present on its surface [44]. Furthermore, we can estimate the size of the
APB by using the solubility of H and C in basaltic melts. To obtain a conservative estimate of the
