but also of its communications with that of the septa, and of its relations with the two
principal spiral canals to be presently described,—is represented in Plate IV. fig. 12.
In this it is clearly seen how irregular is the disposition of the inosculating passages,
whilst there is not a trace of the spicular structure, which ought, if it existed, to be as
well brought into view in a section taken in this direction, as it is in the one shown in
fig. 13, which is taken in a plane at right angles to it. The © marginal cord ” is traversed
on its external surface by longitudinal furrows, which are sometimes very shallow (fig. 15),
but sometimes dip down deeply like those between the convolutions of the brain, as
shown in fig. 16. These furrows usually form a kind of network with fusiform interstices
(Plate V. fig. 5), whilst in other cases they run parallel to each other and inosculate
more rarely (fig. 4). From the correspondence between their arrangement and that of
the passages in the interior, I am inclined to think that they belong to the same system
with these, being, in fact, canals not covered in by shell-zubstance, that communicate

with the plexus within by inosculating branches, whose apertures may sometimes be
detected in the bottom of the furrows. This furrowed surface of the marginal band,
and the existence upon it of apertures communicating with & set of canals in its s8ub-
stance, were specially pointed out by me in Nummulites (loc. oit.), rig changes
produced by fossilization prevent the full extent of the * marginal plexus ” from being
traced out in that genus. The general relation of the marginal cord (a a) to the two
