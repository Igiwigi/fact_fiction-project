yapour which hugs the earth, and offering itself to space, must lose heat by the radiation
from its vapour, and in this act alone we should haye the necessity for condensation.
The © yapour plane” must also depend, to a greater or less extent, on the chilling effects
of radiation.

The action of mountains as condensers must, T think, be connected with these con-
8iderations. When a moist wind encounters a mountain-range it is tilted upwards, and
condensation is no doubt to some extent due to the work performed by the expanding
air; but the other cause cannot be neglected ; for the air not only performs work, but
it is lifted to a region where its yapour can freely lose its heat by radiation into space.
During the absence of wet winds the mountains themselvyes also lose their heat by radia-
tion, and are thus prepared for actual surface condensation. We must indeed take into
account the fact that this radiant quality of water is persistent throughout its three
states of aggregation. As vapour it loses its heat and promotes condensation ; as water
it loses its heat and promotes congelation ; as solid it loses its heat and renders the
gurfaces on which it rests more powerful refrigerators than they would otherwise be.
The formation of a cloud before the air which contains it touches a cold mountain, and
indeed the formation of a cloud anywhere over a cold tract of land, where the cloud is
caused by the cold of the tract, is due to the radiation from the aqueous vapour. 'The
uniformly diffused fogs which sometimes fill the atmosphere in still weather may be
due to cold generated by uniform radiation throughout the mass, and not to the mixture
of currents of different temperatures. The cloud by which the track of the Nile and
Ganges (and sometimes the rivers of our own country) may be followed on a clear morn-
ing is, I believe, due to the chilling of the saturated air aboye the riyer by radiation
from its vapour.
