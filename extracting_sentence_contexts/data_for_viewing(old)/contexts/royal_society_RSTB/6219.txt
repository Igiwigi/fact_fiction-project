one-third of what might be expected. The figures for Glossina submorsitans are not
essentially different, and one notes that Porrs, working with morsitans at Kikori,
Tanganyika, obtained birth-rates of two or a little over (Porrs, 1933, p. 294, para. a).
It must therefore be admitted that, though Glossina appears to survive well, the birth-
rate shows that cage conditions are not as good as they might be. It is possible that
exposure to stable conditions of temperature and humidity is unfavourable to
Glossina, and we need experimental data on that point. At the same time, it would
be well to investigate the effect of light.

But in spite of difficulties and limitations, we claim certain advantages and
successes for the experimental method. By it much that is new has been discovered H
for instance, the effect of season on the weight of flies, Tables VIII and IX 5. tne
fact that flies will die of inanition rather than feed at high humidities, Table VII,
fig. 3; the discovery that temperature in the field is close to the lethal, for adults,
Tables XXIII and XXV, and for puparia, Table XXVI; and the observations

that if adults are kept at 30Â° C the resulting puparia have a high mortality (p. 216).
Such knowledge, which is unobtainable in the field, contributes to our understanding
of the fly in its natural environment.

The experimental method has begun to explain and systematize the field work.
It has been observed in several parts of Africa that the proportion of female Glossina
