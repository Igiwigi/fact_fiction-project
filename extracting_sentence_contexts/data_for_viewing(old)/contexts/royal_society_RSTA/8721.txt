“A cube of saltpetre, suspended with the crystallographic axis horizontal, sets
itself between the poles with this axis equatorial. :

“A cube of topaz, suspended with the erystallographie axis horizontal, sets itself
with this axis from pole to pole.

“We have here a kind of complementary case to the former. Both these crystals
are diamagnetic. Saltpetre cleaves parallel to its axis; topaz perpendicular to its
axis. The planes of cleavage, therefore, stand in both cases equatorial, thus agreeing
with sulphate of zine and sulphate of magnesia. ~

“Where do these facts point? A moment’s speculation will perhaps be allowed us
here. May we not suppose these crystals to be composed of layers indefinitely thin,
laid side by side, within the range of cohesion, which holds them together, but yet not
in absolute contact? This seems to be no strained idea; for expansion and
contraction by heat and cold compel us to assume that the particles of matter in
general do not touch each other; that there are unfilled spaces between them. In
such crystals as we have described these spaces may be considered as alternating with
the plates which compose the erystal. From this point of view it seems very natural
that the magnetic laminz should set themselves axial, and the diamagnetic equatorial.

“ Our fundamental idea is, that crystals of one cleavage are made up of plates
indefinitely thin, separated by spaces indefinitely narrow. If, however, we suppose
two cleavages existing at right angles to each other, then we must relinquish the
