The
bean and allied crops are, however, very subject to disease, especially when grown too
frequently on the same land. It is, at least in part, owing to this circumstance, that
the average annual yield oyer the twelve years was 80 much less than would be. the
yield of the crop when grown in suitable alternation with others in a season of average
adaptation for its healthy development. In fact, s0 great was the deterioration in the
character and amount of produce in the experiments in question, due to the continuous
cropping, that whilst the average annual yield of Nitrogen over the first six of the
twelve years was 70 1bs., that over the concluding six years was only 26 Ibs. Nor did
the addition of nitrogenous manure in the form of ammonia-salts, together with liberal
mineral manuring, obviate this deterioration in any material degree more than did
mineral manures alone. Tn further illustration of the larger amount of Nitrogen obtained over a given area of
land in Leguminous crops than in Graminaceous ones, some remarkable results with
clover may be cited.
