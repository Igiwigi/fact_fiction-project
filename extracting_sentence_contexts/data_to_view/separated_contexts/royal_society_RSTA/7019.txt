Lead tetracthyl has a profound anti-knock effect in hydrogen (figure 49). This is directly
contrary to the result reported by Egerton et al. (1935). It seems likely that their failure to
detect the anti-knock effect of lead tetraethyl is due to the fact that they were not able
entirely to eliminate pre-ignition when running on hydrogen (Egerton & Moore 1949).
