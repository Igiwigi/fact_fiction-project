represents the section viewed as an opaque object, in which the white crystallized car-
bonate of lime with which the fistular pith is filled, and which has also occupied these
canals, causes them to stand out with remarkable clearness. In the example of Cala-
mopitus described in my previous memoir, I figured some sections of the vascular bundles
going off to the branches where the vascular tissues were s0 conspicuons and had 0
remarkable an arrangement as coneclusively to demonstrate their true character ; and
though in the specimen under consideration the similar structures (fig. 25, m) are not
80 highly developed, there is no question that in both examples their nature is the same.
These facts do away with the possibility of the canals in question having any direct
relationship with the branches.
& At the Meeting of the British Association at Liverpool, Mr. Carnumaers snggested
=that these organs were points from which roots had been given off. Such, however,
Zannot have been the case, since in the specimens in which they occur they exist
=throughout the entire length of the stem from its base to its summit. Moreover they
are located in the centre of the cellular tissue of the wpper part of each primary medul-
Yary ray, whilst, as I shall immediately demonstrate, there is abundant evidence proving
hat the roots were given off from the lower part of each internode. 'The position
Sf these canals in relation to each internode of the stem—their isolation, internally amid
the cellular tissue of the medulla, and externally in that of the primary medullary ray
2—the obvious mode of their formation, 1st, by the rupture, and, 2nd, by the absorption
Sf those cellular tiswes—the entire absence from every example yet examined of all
