woody tissues. In this hypertrophied wood more or less typical resin canals oceur.”

Kirscu,f on the other hand, has held that resin canals are formed in regions of
abundant food supply, not as reversions to ancestral habit, but to provide increased
translocation facilities for the elaborated food.

In considering these hypotheses, the difference between physiological conditions in
the wood and the bast are pertinent, since the relative availability of food supply might
reasonably be thought to exert a corresponding influence on the production of resin
canals in these two regions. Thus, one might expect the stimulus to the formation of
the canals, which acts on the cambium,{ to produce greater results on the side
where the food supply is ordinarily conceded to be greatest, that is, in the bast. The
facts, however, are the reverse. The stimulus produces a result only in the ray cells
of the bast, the sieve tube initials and other bast elements proper not being affected,

t It is just possible that the stimulus acts on the young products on the tracheary side of the cambium,
our reason for stating this being the fact that we have just recently found that formic acid when inserted
into a wound travels far up the tissues, evidently in the upward current in the wood, and results in
