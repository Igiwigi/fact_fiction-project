It is easy to find numerical examples of the distributions of Ri and Ri for which (4.8) is violated
(see example S.2 in electronic supplementary material, file S). As shown below, however, (4.8)
cannot be violated if a maximally connected coupling for the 1-2 system exists. It follows from
the fact that the statement of theorem 4.1 can be reversed: (4.4), (4.6) and (4.7) imply that D is
non-contextual. We establish this fact by first characterizing the distributions of R} and Rj for a
non-contextual 1-2 system (theorem 4.4 with corollary 4.5), and then showing that (4.8) always
holds for such distributions (theorem 4.6). Theorem 4.4.
