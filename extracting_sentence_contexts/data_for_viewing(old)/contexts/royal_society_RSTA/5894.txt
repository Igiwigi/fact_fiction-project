momentum and angular momentum of the nuclear subsystem. By evaluating the commutators in 2 |
the Heisenberg equations of motion, we found that a novel quantum mechanical force operator

appeared in all three identities. In terms of this force operator, all three identities could be put 3
in a form directly analogous to the classical equations of motion dE/dt=F-v, dP/dt=F and oS
dL/dt =R x F. 7s

One wrinkle in those results was the fact that the classical force-times-velocity form could only 12

be achieved for the rate of change of one part of the nuclear kinetic energy, namely the term
