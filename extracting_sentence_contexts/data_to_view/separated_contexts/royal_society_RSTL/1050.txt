with respect to turkeys ; and that even to a greater extent. There is certainly some difficulty in reconciling these facts to
impregnation by contact of semen ; but from the very obvious
difference between oviparous and viviparous animals, I shall not
press this argument farther. Indeed it should always be im-
pressed on the recollection of those who are labouring in the
pursuit of truth, that arguments drawn from analogies, unless
from those of the nearest relation, are better adapted to the
purpose of illustration than of proof: and though they fre-
quently find advocates in confident closet philosophers, they
are received with deserved distrust by the more cautious prac-
tical physiologists. Those who cannot admit the passage of semen by the tubes,
do not neglect to take the advantage of some difficulties which
their opponents have overlooked.
