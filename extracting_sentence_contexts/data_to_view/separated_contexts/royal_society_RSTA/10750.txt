A careful examination of this complex with a high
power proves it to be essentially the same in all alloys from Sn 6 to Sn 20. The
= photographs we give will, we think, justify this statement. The fact that the eutectic
& point CO of the LC alloys is a little higher than the eutectic point X of the CD alloys
3 is evident in the pyrometric curves of Roperts-AUSTEN and STANSFIELD, and we have
§ also verified it, as may be seen in our cooling curves. But Professor RoozEBoom
& suggests that the true eutectic angle for all alloys from 7 to D’ is at C’, and that the
‘© apparent depression of X is a retardation due to the difficulty experienced by the «
8 in erystallising without a nucleus of its own kind. Thus in the region XD,D’ the
Palloys are a complex of 8 (or y) and 8, while below XD, they form a complex of
op a and 6.
‘~The curves /C’XD’ record the equilibrium between the solids « and 6 and the solid
6 solution out of which they crystallise, and the method of examining chilled ingots has
S:enabled us to follow the whole process in a very satisfactory manner.
