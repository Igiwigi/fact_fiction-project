We leave the regression setting and turn to some other traditional areas
of multi-variate statistical analysis. We describe briefly two active areas of
development: investigation of the properties of classical methods when the number
of variables is large, and development of new, typically nonlinear variants of these
methods that respond to high dimension. In the first direction, it is a striking fact that most of the standard techniques
of classical multi-variate analysis—principal components analysis, canonical
correlation analysis, multi-variate analysis of variance, discriminant analysis
and so forth—are based on the eigenanalysis of sample covariance matrices. Under Gaussian assumptions for the distributions of the sampled data, and
under the symmetry assumptions characteristic of null hypotheses, the sampling
densities of the eigenvalues of these matrices have precisely the laws arising in
the classical orthogonal polynomial ensembles of random matrix theory. The
natural asymptotics in random matrix theory—reflecting its origins in the many-
particle models of statistical and nuclear physics—allow the number of variables
to become large.
