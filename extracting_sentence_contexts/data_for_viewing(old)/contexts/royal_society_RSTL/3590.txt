57. A $spectrum from a highly refractive and dispersive flint-glass prism, the com-
panion to the crown prism before mentioned, and, like it, the personal gift of Fraun-
HoFER, of faultless purity and perfect workmanship, was thrown on the same crown
lens as in the last experiment. This was purposely placed at once oblique to the in-
cident light, and out of the plane of dispersion of the prism, or that plane to which
its refracting edge is perpendicular, Moreover, it was 80 arranged that the spectrum
might fall on any part of the lens, above, below, or on either side of its centre, Under
these circumstances, it is easy to give excessive concentration to light of any given
degree of refrangibility, the rest being thrown aside into long, coloured caustics. In
fact, the image of the spectrum is thus bent and distorted into curvilinear forms, the
general type of which may be assimilated to the letter C lengthened and flattened,
with ends more or Jess unequal. And upon these curyes, 80 opened or contracted,

the colours may be made to occupy any spaces, by receiving the spectrum higher or
lower on the lens, and by inclining its axis more or less to the plane of incidence.
Without calling coloured figures to aid our description, we may conceive the matter
perhaps most readily by considering the spectrum as painted on a ring, or on some
oval curvilinear form, having the eye more or less elevated above its plane, and ca-
pable of being made to reyolve about its centre, the spectrum, including the che-
