Hence the thin laminar
extension of the perianth, which soon finds a new use from the standpoint of wind
dispersal ; and this, with consequent precocity of formation, usurps the place of all
other useless parts. There is no reason why these may not have once included
functionless stamens derived from a once hermaphrodite flower, although there is
no direct proof available at the present time. These correlations are not merely
fanciful: they afford a logical sequence for the deduction of the fact, sufficiently
obvious, though requiring to be â€˜established, that the ancestral cone was a more
elongated strobilus, in the axils of whose scales arose centric flowers and a centric
nucellus invested by centric envelopes, without lateral extensions. Furthermore, in
such a cone, the scales would at some time have been separated by internodal

extension, so that the pollen-grains fell between the scales directly on the nucellus ;
the micropyle being a mere collecting funnel to which a long tube was non-essential
and non-existent. That is to say, it is sufficiently clear that at one time (1) the cone
must have had an opening mechanism ; (2) it was originally essentially strobiloid
(even if we had not at hand the staminate cone, with about an equal number of less
reduced flowers, since less xerophytically adapted owing to its transitory existence) ;
(3) the outer envelope, originally centric, showed differentiation into at least internal
aqueous tissue and an external zone of fibrous wavy cells, now no longer sclerosed, but
originally affording a sclerosed investment to the seed, in the manner of a sclerotesta,
or even more suggestive of the interwoven fibres which constitute the drupe-stones
of such plants as Hedera and Ilex, The special peculiarity of the ovulate flower of
Welwitschia really owes its existence to the loss of the opening mechanism.
