and we may consequently connect with each pentagon the sign + or — ; there are, in
fact, six pentagons with the 8ign + and six with the sign — ; and to each positive
pentagon there corresponds a negative pentagon, which is derived from it by stellation,
viz. to the positive pentagon 12345 there corresponds the negative one 24135, and 80
EW the other positive pentagons. The above-mentioned system of equations

A fact exhibits the six positive pentagons, each accompanied by its stellated negative
Yentagon, and the formation of the system of equations is thus completely explained ;
He order of arrangement of the pairs inter se (or, what comes to the same thing, the
=#rder of arrangement of the suffixes of the 9's) is wholly immaterial.

= 10. The six pairs of pentagons, or, what is the same thing, the g's, correspond to each
ther in pairs in a fivefold manner, quoad the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively ; thus,
Buoad 5, the pairs are @, and @,, @, and @,, ©, and @, or 8ay 1 and 4, 2 and 5, 3 and 6.
She relation is best seen by means of the positive pentagons; thus, guoad 5, in the
Hentagons 12345 and 21435, the points adjacent to 5 in the one of them are the points
Z, 3, and in the other of them the complementary points 1, 4; and s0 in the other cases.
he fivefold correspondence is shown by the symbolical equations
