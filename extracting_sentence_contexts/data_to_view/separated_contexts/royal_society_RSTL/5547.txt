PALLAs has obseryed this phenomenon in Zuprepia casta ; BERNOULLI in Gastrophage
potatoria and Episema caruleocephala; BASLER in G. quercifolia ; SUCKOW in (7. pint ;
TRrevIiraxus in Sphing Tigustri, and NORDMANN in Smerinthus populi. These instances are
mentioned in BURMEIsTER's Manual, p. 312; and SreBoLDy has attempted to explain them
away, but m the present state of our knowledge the assertions are more probable than the
explanation. Moreover, S1EB0LD himself has observed parthenogenesis in Solenobia lichenella and
S. clathrella ||, in Psyche helix and in ApisT.

LacorpalRe** mentions the same fact as having occurred in Liparis dispar for three
SUCcessive generations. * Acad&mie des Sciences, 28th Sept. 1856. +
