discharge structure has been observed for atmospheric pressure at a small addition of
hydrocarbons corresponding to lean mixtures (CH4 at ER = 0.3 and C3Hg at ER = 0.8) [26]. This is
in correlation with experimental results of [27], where a multichannel discharge structure was
observed at C3Hg additions at the level of 2% (ER=0.52). This correspond to the following
densities of hydrocarbons: [CH,] ~ 7 x 10!” cm~$ and [C3Hg] *5 x 10!7 cm~%. For radiation at
the wavelength range 4 = 98-103 nm, this gives, taking into account the cross sections from [28],
the absorption coefficient 20-30 cm! atm™!. Another important issue is a decrease of ionizing UV
radiation because of quenching of the emitting states, No (b7 Dit) and No(b! IT,,). These factors are
very important for the problem of PAC by nanosecond discharges, as densities of hydrocarbons
and H20 molecules, absorbing UV-radiation efficiently, can be high in combustible mixtures.

Finally, the rate of electron attachment increases significantly with gas number density. This
fact is illustrated by figure 9, where a characteristic time of attachment to oxygen molecule in air
is plotted for 3 and 5 atm. With pressure increase, the characteristic time of electron attachment
becomes comparable with duration of a nanosecond pulse. So, higher E/N values are necessary
to keep a given electron density when pressure increases.

In surface discharges, the role of the volume photo-ionization can be relatively small. Electron
emission from the surface of dielectric under the action of UV radiation of streamer head can be
an important additional process sustaining the discharge propagation. So, the experimental study
of parameters and of a structure of the surface dielectric barrier discharge with a different fraction
of hydrocarbons or H2O molecules in the mixture at fixed HV pulse characteristic, pressure and
temperature is a topical task in the problem of PAC.
