Christmas-tree-like early rudiment of Drosophila may be compared with this scale (Lees &

ORIENTATION IN LEPIDOPTERAN SCALES i 15

On the basis of studies using polarizing microscope and electron microscope, Gentil
(1941, 1942) came to the conclusion that the ridge of the iridescent scales of Morpho is
a fibrillar structure—a Stdbchenmischkérper—but supposed that the ridge of the glass-clear
covering -scales was built up from a linear series of overlapping, half-conical lamellae.
Kinder & Siiffert (1943), however, point out that this latter suggestion is untenable, since
the ridge would then show much stronger light absorption along the line of its attachment
to the scale than at its free edge; this in fact is not observed.

Regarding the detailed interpretation of ridge structure, Kinder & Siiffert differ from
Anderson & Richards. The former suppose that each ridge is built up by the superposition
of ten lamellae (in the X, Y plane) (Morpho achilles), each of which is composed of two
parallel rods (lying side by side in the X, Y plane) which may or may not be united by
a membrane. Anderson & Richards, on the other hand, conclude from their photographs
that each ridge is built up from about five vertical vanes (in the X, Z plane) whose plane
is normal to the surface of the scale; each vane is composed of about twelve horizontal
mullions (lying in the X, Y plane) united by a thin membrane which is thickened at intervals
to form vertical mullions (in the X, Z plane). The horizontal mullions, lying side by side in
the ridge, form the reflecting planes, though not united laterally. Both sets of workers agree
that the ridges of the Morpho iridescent scales are composed of fibrils, parallel to the X axis,
