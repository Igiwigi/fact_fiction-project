261. If the motion of the metal be in the same direction, but the angular
velocity of its parts relative to the pole of the magnet different, then currents
exist. This is the case in Araco's experiment, and also in the wire subject to
the earth's induction (172.), when it was moved from west to east.

262. If the magnet moves not directly to or from the arrangement, but late-
rally, then the case is similar to the last.

263, If different parts move in opposite directions across the magnetic
curves, then the effect is a maximum for equal velocities.

264. All these in fact are variations of one simple condition, namely, that all
parts of the mass shall not move in the same direction across the curyes, and
with the same angular velocity. But they are forms of expression which being
retained in the mind, I have found useful when comparing the consistency of
particular phenomena with general results.
