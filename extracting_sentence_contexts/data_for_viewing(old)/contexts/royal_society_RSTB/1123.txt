In the Monkey, the average result for the left side is ‘016, that for the right -011,
It will be noticed that in each animal the sum of the two readings is slightly larger
than the average for the unsplit cord.

A further table (4) give the results of a similar splitting operation carried out on

. the upper end of the lower peripheral fragment of the divided cord in two Cats.

In one Cat (137) the left half of the split cord showed a resting difference of “007,
and the right ‘016; in the other Cat (143) the left half showed ‘021, and the right
‘013. The amounts are considerably below those just mentioned, one reason doubtless
being the fact that the portion of cord upon which the operation was carried out was
severed from the brain.

(c.) Cord previously operated upon.—It has already been pointed out that, while
severance from the brain seems to induce a condition in the separated cord in which
the amount of the resting difference is less than it otherwise would have been, further
operations upon this severed fragment do not seem to notably affect the difference,
provided they are made in such situations as to leave a part of the cord both intact
and in situ between their seat and the portion observed.

That is to say, the difference in the lower fragment of a cord severed from the brain
is not further diminished by exposing it again in its continuity and performing there
either section of one or of several columns.
