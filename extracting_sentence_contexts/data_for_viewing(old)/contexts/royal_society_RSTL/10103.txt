then, the olfactory bulbs of the Rabbit are thus brought into direct and decussating
connexion through an extensive course with the specialised cortex of the inner

marginal aspect of the brain in its anterior regions—a region proved by Ferrer to
have motor endowments. In the Rat, on the other hand, this fasciculus is brought
into relationship not 80 much with the motor cortex as with the cortex of the occipital
pole, with which it has most extensive connexions. No doubt need be entertained
upon these facts after a careful examination of horizontal and vertical sections of the
frozen brain of these animals, and by dissection and teasing ont of these structures.
In vertical sections I have repeatedly succeeded in tracing the posterior commissural
fasciculus upwards towards the projection 8ystem above, and have teased ont, by
means of a dissecting needle, the whole of its course from the anterior commissure
to the brush-like head, leaving it a compact band of fibres entirely separated from the
surrounding structures.

The olfactory lyre,—This is a structure which I have ventured to name by what
appears a very appropriate term when its configuration is thoroughly understood—it
has up to the present been entirely overlooked in descriptions of the olfactory apparabus.
Mevxerrt distinetly states, when describing the posterior extensians from the anterior
commissure in his classical work on the brain of Mammals,* that the fasciculus passes
