as a tract so placed as to lie on the side of the tube foot nearest the radial cord and
facing towards the circumoral nerve ring (figs. 9, 10, 11, 12, 16).

Because of the constant position of the longitudinal tract of the tube foot and of
the presence, in the radial nerve cord, of fibrillar tracts in which bipolar ganglion
cells, orientated along the length of the cord, are to be found, a polarization of the
nervous system is presumed, the circumoral nerve ring serving as the centre for the
coordination of impulses.

In its nervous organization the azygos tentacle differs from the other tube feet only
in the fact that the sensory elements and subepithelial plexus are more or less confined
to its oral surface—the surface which is normally in a position to receive stimuli
(figs. 17, 18).

The “ eye” is composed of numerous invaginations of the ectoderm of the optic
cushion, i.e., the swollen end of the radial nerve cord. Each invagination or optic
cup is provided with a lens, derived from the basal portions of the surrounding
epithelial cells, and over the lens there is a cuticular covering. Lining the cup are
pigmented cells, containing granules of an orange colour, and sensory cells. The
sensory elements consist.of an almost transparent optic vesicle projecting into the
cavity of the cup and a cell body drawn out into a central fibre, which latter merges
with the fibrillae of the underlying plexus (fig. 19).
