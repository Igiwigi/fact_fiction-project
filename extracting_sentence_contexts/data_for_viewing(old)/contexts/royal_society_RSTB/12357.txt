bones m™ of soil column, the time period over which the
soil was accumulated (42000 ka to 13000 ka in Duvanniy
Yar), and the average age of the animals at the time of death.
If we account for the average weight of adults for each species,
the system sustained approximately 10.5 Mg of herbivores
km”? [31]. We can expect heterogeneity in the above density
values across the vast expanses of the Pleistocene mammoth
steppe. However, commercial tusk collection data from
Yedoma in different regions suggest similar numbers for
mammoth [31], and multi-taxon herbivory values in Mamon-
tovy Khayata—another intensively exposure east of the Lena
River Delta, as well as in the New Siberian Islands, are roughly
similar to those in Duvanniy Yar [66]. In fact, data from
multiple sources suggest herbivore biomass values ranging
between 8.8 and 10.5Mg of herbivores km™, with even
greater values in Great Britain in last interglacial [35],
suggesting that herbivore density values might have been
even higher in past interglacials, because improved climatic
conditions would translate in higher productivity. These
values are within the range of present-day African savannah
game reserves, 0.9-19.1 Mg of herbivores km? [35].
