and even here the effect of foreshortening is very difficult to allow for. The available
evidence is, however, summarized in text-figs. 2-5, the measurements being indicated by
ruled lines. With the smallest possible allowance for foreshortening (an allowance based
on the diameter of the nucleolus) the length of the photographed specimen of early
pachytene (fig. 34, Plate 17; text-fig. 4) is markedly greater than that of the measured
early somatic prophase (text-fig. 2). And the same can be said of the longest piece of
unpaired chromosome so far seen at zygotene (text-fig. 5), both ends of which are lost
in the tangled mass. No room could be found in the plates for a photograph of this
specimen, but this is no great loss since it is incomplete. The most that can be said
about it is that it accords with the other evidence; it is not full confirmation.*

* The difference of 25% shown between text-figs. 5 and 2 (the measured somatic prophase) would of
course be quite effective confirmation of the fact of elongation if it were clear that the measurements
could be used at their face value. Caution in this is however necessary from the many sources of
uncertainty regarding the exact somatic length.

206 I. MANTON ON EVIDENCE ON SPIRAL STRUCTURE

While all emphasis is thus laid on the weakness of this part of the evidence it is
nevertheless true that such facts as there are cannot easily be swept aside, for the
single aceto-carmine specimen at leptotene (text-fig. 6) remains unrefuted. It is un-
fortunate that no comparable figures appear to exist for another plant. Leptotene
