altered state of the discus vitellinus in the unfecundated ovarian ovum. $0 far from
thinking that such is the case, I venture to believe that the whole substance of the
cicatricula in the laid egg of the Bird has its origin within the germinal vesicle in
the same manner as in the ovum of Mammalia+, and therefore that the cicatricula
in the Bird's laid egg may properly be called the germ +.

No fixed Relation between the Degree of Development of Ova and their Size, Locality,
or Age.

365. In my last memoir it was shown that at early periods the several parts of the
ovum do not necessarily keep pace with one another, and that there is no fixed relation
between the size of the entire oyum and the degree of development of its most essential
part. Of the latter fact, many figures in the present paper afford further proof, and
show that the statement is applicable to ova still within the ovaryh. The ovarian
ovum Plate XXII. fig. 162, measured 4", though it had not undergone fecunda-
tion||. That in Plate XXIIT. fig. 172, was certainly fecundated, but it measured
only #7". The oyum Plate XXV. fig. 196, measured F‚Äù, but was less advanced in the
essential part than that in fig. 198, which had less than balf its diameter. Several
other instances of this kind will be found on comparing the figures. The large size,
however, which oya in some instances attain without the germ being proportionably
developed, is referable mainly to the quantity of fluid imbibed by the chorion ; for
before the formation of this membrane the irregularity in question is not s0 great.
This will be seen on reference to the Table, par. 428, in which the measurements of
the chorion and membrane f in many ova haye been recorded}.
