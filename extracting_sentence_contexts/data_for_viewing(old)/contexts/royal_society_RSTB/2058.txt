102 DR. D, H. SCOTT ON THE STRUCTURE AND AFFINITIES

speaking of recent plants, but rather as a type of petiolar structure, common, no
doubt, to a certain group of the Medullosez.

M. Renavutr found reason to believe that Myelowylon Landrioti: represents the
petiole and rachis of leaves belonging to the form-genus Alethopteris. The organiza-
tion of the leaves of our Medullosa renders it highly probable that they too would
fall under the same category, The resemblance in structure to M. RENAULtâ€™s specimens
is, in fact, a very close one.* The identification of the leaf of Medullosa anglica cannot,
however, be finally settled without further investigation, on which I am now engaged.

8. The Roots.

Tt appears that the structure of the root has not been described as yet in any
species of Medullosa.

The material from Hough Hill contains a number of specimens of a very charac-
teristic root, of triarch structure, with well-marked secondary wood and bast, and a
conspicuous zone of periderm (see Plate 8, photograph 19, and Plate 13, fig. 20). The
larger roots attain a mean diameter of about half an inch (12 millims. or more), and
are accompanied by rootlets of various dimensions and similar structure.
