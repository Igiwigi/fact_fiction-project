in part, the emerging concept of an ‘enabling environment’ of interacting factors at household :
community and national/state levels that will tend to facilitate or obstruct the continued effective
delivery and use of desired services. Environmental and economic aspects of sustainability
require negotiation with water resources management and agricultural water users, respectively.

Transaction costs of work involving several domains of water security are not trivial.
Experience with integrated water management in recent decades has sometimes been very time-
intensive but with limited output. The optimal degree of cross-domain collaboration needs to be
assessed. The extent of complexity and relevance of water and sanitation to diverse domains is
illustrated by the fact that the number of UN entities engaged in water issues now exceeds 30.

5. Conclusion

The broad water security definition, combined with the human right to water and sanitation,
has the potential to provide a sound policy base for sustainable improvement of the human
condition ina fragile environment. Much detailed exploration of the implications of this approach
is required, and its implications for the way targets are set and monitored. It can support a
better view of the balance between new construction and maintenance than has been the case
in recent decades, and foster a better approach to downstream sanitation in which risks are more
carefully examined. It can point towards more longitudinal monitoring and sustainable water and
sanitation systems at all stages of economic development, but only if used as a driver of thorough
work and not merely as a new slogan or fashionable phrase.
