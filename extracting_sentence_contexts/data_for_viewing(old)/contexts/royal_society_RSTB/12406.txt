to increase their ability to adhere to a wide variety of under-
water surfaces. The occurrence of several protein isoforms
has been observed in other marine adhesives from mussel
[36] and sea urchin [37] and it has been hypothesized that
this may increase the types of interactions the adhesive can
mediate with different types of underwater surfaces. To date
it is unknown whether the remarkable ability of diatoms to
adhere to a wide range of surfaces is accomplished through
the secretion of an ‘all-for-one’ glue or whether they have
the ability to sense different types of surfaces and modify
the composition of their adhesive material.

The fact that all of the proteins identified in this study
were found associated within the greater than 400 kDa
HMW component suggests that they all assemble into
multi-protein complexes. This raises the interesting possi-
bility that the diatom adhesive strands are in fact much
more complex than previously thought. Instead of being a
homogeneous fibrous biopolymer that extends from the
plasma membrane to the substratum [2,38], the adhesive
strands may be composed of numerous distinct proteins
and/or domains. In contrast to a homopolymer, such multi-
protein complexes would be better suited to execute the
manifold tasks required to achieve adhesion and gliding: sub-
strate adhesion, cohesion of the strands, connecting the
