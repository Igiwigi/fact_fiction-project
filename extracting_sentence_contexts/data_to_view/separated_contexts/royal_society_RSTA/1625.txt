The change in behaviour around z = 0.4Mm can be understood by looking again at figure 3. We see here that the magnetic fields in the two models are quite similar in regions between the
average tr = 1 surface and average 6 = 1 surface which is around z = 0.5 Mm. We believe that the
similarity in both simulations in terms of wave propagation is due to the fact that the dynamics
of the waves below the plasma f = 1 surface is not dominated by the magnetic fields, but by the
thermodynamic properties of the atmosphere. The thermal properties of the atmosphere in the
near-surface layers are similar in the two cases of Sun-v100 and Sun-h100. In the low plasma Â£
layers, however, the waves see a different magnetic field orientation between the two magnetic
models as they propagate.
