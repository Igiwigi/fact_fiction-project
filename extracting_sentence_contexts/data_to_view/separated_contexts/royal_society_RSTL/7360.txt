b PROFESSOR CAYLEY'S EIGHTH MEMOIR ON QUANTICS. 545

this gives ny
«07—[3d,0,+y0;= oz v Adzxdp
(£d;—[d,0,+703)*(a, b, c, d, e, fx, y)*
=ADZ®(A, I,  'v,, ALX, Y)*
=120A(X+/#Y);

and thence

the left hand side is a linear coyariant, of the degree 5, it is consequently a mere nume-
rical multiple of Pz+Qy; and it is easy to verify that it is =120(Pz+Qy). (In fact
writing 6=d=e=0, the expression is (3%; —af ,d,)(aa*+10ca%y*+fy*), and the only
term which contains & is a*f* . 050; . 10ca%*=1200%f*.
