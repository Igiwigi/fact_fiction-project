mally when heated; neither can I detect any electricity when the plate e or f is under
the influence of radiation if I connect the wire g with a delicate electroscope. In
experimenting with this apparatus I have also completely immersed it in liquids, 8uch
as water, s0Jutions of metallic salts, ether, disulphide of carbon, &c. The heat has
been applied in these cases by introducing a glass bulb containing water at different
temperatures and a thermometer (28). Under all these varied circumstances the
movements took place in the regular manner, and no electrical action whateyer could
be detected.

122. I have already discussed Professxor O8B0RxNE REYNOLDS's theory of evaporation
and condensation somewhat fully in the already quoted Physical Society paper*. T
will, however, describe the following experiments, which I think prove that Professor
RevyNorps has not suggested a theory which accounts for all the facts of the case, and
therefore has not hit upon the true explanation.

A thick and strong bulb was blown at the end of a piece of very difficultly fusible
green glass, specially made for steam-boiler gauges. In it was supported a thin bar of
aluminium at the end of a long platinum wire. 'The upper end of the wire was passed
through the top of the tube and well sealed in, for electrical purposes (120). The
apparatus was sealed by fusion to the Sprengel pump, and exhaustion was kept going
on for two days, until an induction-spark refused to pass across the vacuum. During
this time the bulb and its contents were several times raised to a dull red heat. At
the end of two days' exhaustion the tube was found to behave in the same manner
