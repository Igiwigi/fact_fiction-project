These negative results were in contrast to
the findings for female Columbian ground squirrels, in a
study by Neuhaus [27], where a similar experimental ecto-
parasite removal experiment was conducted, and both body
mass and numbers of offspring were significantly elevated
by the ectoparasite removal. The different results on the
impact of ectoparasites between the sexes were rather surpris-
ing, especially as male-biased parasitism is well documented
in mammals [28-30]. This difference might be explained by
the fact that Neuhausâ€™ study [27] was conducted on a very
small scale (four treated and five control females) and
without measuring actual ectoparasites loads. To help clarify these different results, we conducted
another study with increased sample sizes and more par-
ameters to confirm the fitness costs of parasites for free-
ranging females in this species. Specifically, we re-examined
the costs of ectoparasites for wild female Columbian ground
squirrels, with an expanded sample from several ground squir-
rel colonies.
