Figure 1. Scatterplot relationship showing the behavioual correlates of reputations. (a) The number of CFADs ego assisted in the first 10-month time period and his
teputation for prosociality (y-axis on log scale). (b) The number of days ego was a CFAD in the first 10-month time period and his reputation for labour competency
(y-axis on log scale).
