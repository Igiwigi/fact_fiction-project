‘Biofilm’ sites correspond to small biofilm regions, such ammonium by the action of the enzyme GDH. In turn, we
that variable values would correspond to averages across mul- model GDH synthesis in its inactive form (h) and subsequent

observation that GDH overexpression in the periphery kills bio- The biofilm is assumed to expand proportionally to 5 |
