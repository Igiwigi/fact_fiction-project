semicircular in transverse section, with the nerve fibres confined to the flat ventral side
(Huxley & de Beer 1934, figure 180). This is very like the neurocord of Enteropneusta,
which has nothing corresponding to the notochord beneath it (the doubtfully homologous
stomochord being anterior to the collar), but which has instead a band of muscles, those
of the perihaemal cavities. Apparently both neural tube and neurocord assume a similar
form when developing under similar conditions.

The neurocord resembles the neural tube in having a lumen or residual lacunae,
bounded by epithelial cells resembling periventricular ependymal cells, amongst which
are gland cells like those in the neural tube of lampreys, sharks and teleosts (Kappers 1929).
In view of the other evidence placing the Enteropneusta in the phylum Chordata, the
neurocord is very probably homologous with the neural tube, and its presence as a mere
conducting tract suggests that the Enteropneusta are degenerate. The fact that large
unipolar ganglion cells are almost entirely confined to it, and to the dorsal nerve cord
immediately behind the collar, indicates that this region was once a nerve centre, but now
the nervous system is diffuse, with no centres.

It seems a reasonable hypothesis that the Enteropneusta arose from some group of more
generalized chordates, that possessed a ciliated larva with three pairs of coelomic pouches
and the rudiments ofa notochord and neural tube. After closure of the latter in the middle
somite its further development was arrested. Adaptive modifications connected with the
adoption of a burrowing habit supervened. In many forms the anterior somite elongated
as an organ of locomotion, in all the posterior somite elongated to house the long gut
necessary for dealing with bottom deposits, whilst the ventral nerve cord appeared as
a neomorph, to control the locomotory muscles and cilia. The middle somite underwent
