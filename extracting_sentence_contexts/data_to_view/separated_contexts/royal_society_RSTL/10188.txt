THE ABSOLUTE

1 mercury unit='9337 x 109 C.G.S.

differing nearly 1 per cent. from the value ('941) obtained by ourselves,

$2. Under the conviction that this method offers in some respects important,
advantages, and influenced also by the fact that the arrangements for producing and
measuring the uniform rotation necessary were ready to our hands, we determined to -
give it a trial, in the hope of obtaining confirmation of the results already arrived at
by ourselves and by GLAZEBROOK with other methods. Ad first the intention was to
follow LorgvTz in using for the resistance a glass tube full of mercury, with two
points of which contact would be made by platinum wires passing through the glass,
It appeared, however, that there would be difficulty in making the measurements
with the degree of accuracy aimed at. If the wires were sealed into the glass, the
section would probably be rendered irregular.
