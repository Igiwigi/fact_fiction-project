[30]. LptA does not interact directly with LptE [31].

These studies, although enabling a consensus about the val-
idity of the bridge model, opened many more questions. For
example, it is unknown how many LptA monomers are found
in a single bridge. Interestingly, although the structures of
LptA and LptC possess many conserved hydrophobic residues
in their core, in comparison with mammalian LPS-binding pro-
teins, they do not contain an obvious cavity deep enough to fit
the lipid A fatty acyl chains of LPS [8]. Tran et al. [24] demon-
strated in pull-down assays that LptA binds the lipid A core,
and Okuda et al. [11] demonstrated that residues in the grooves
of LptA and LptC can, in fact, cross-link to LPS, but it remains an
open question exactly how LPS interacts with the bridge. It is
also unclear whether it is transported as a stream of single mol-
ecules or as aggregates. More work is needed to understand
exactly how LPS makes its journey across the periplasm.

4. Assembly of the outer membrane translocon:

a plug in a barrel

The assembly of the LptDE OM translocon is a feat that
requires the coordination of several pathways. LptD is an
OM protein that contains two domains: a C-terminal trans-
