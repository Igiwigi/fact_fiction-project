THE OVUM IN THE AMPHIBIA. 207

But however satisfactory these experiments were with regard to that fact, they still
left the question of the immediate agency of the spermatozoa in impregnation in
doubt. I therefore repeated them with greater precision, and with that object only
in view, and took especial care to obtain as perfect a filtration and separation of the
spermatozoa from the fluid as possible. The results were far more interesting and
instructive than I had anticipated, as I found by repeated examination by the micro-
8cope that the filtered fluid was almost completely deprived of spermatozoa, one or
two only being occasionally detected in it, with a very few nuclei and spermatozoal
cells. One circumstance that tended to increase the value of this set of experiments,
and to prove the influence of the spermatozoa, was, that the ova employed were not
fully matured, and hence I had less expectation of a fayourable result. The quantity
of seminal fluid obtained was larger than usual, and this was mixed with twice its
quantity of water. This mixed fluid was divided, as before, into two portions, one of
