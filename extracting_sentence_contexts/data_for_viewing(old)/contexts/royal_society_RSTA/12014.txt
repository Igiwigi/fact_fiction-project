354 MR. K. PEARSON ON THE MATHEMATICAL THEORY OF EVOLUTION,

for the data given for Professor We pon’s Crab Measurements, No, 4, ‘ Phil. Trans.,’
A, vol. 185, p. 96.
jy = 7°6759, pay = BATS, py = 184°3039,
Hence,
B, = ps"/pa® = 0267022,
By = pulp? = 3°12807.

Thus 6 + 38, — 28, is positive, and accordingly no rational point-binomial is likely
to fit as well as the normal curve. As a matter of fact the fundamental cubic is now

176032) + 1:0453272* + *033773z — ‘0003709 = 0,

‘The two negative roots of this equation give imaginary value for p and g. The
small positive root gives p greater than unity and q negative, n is also negative.
Although I can give no interpretation to these results, it seemed well to complete in
the latter case the solution and test how near the resulting point-binomial fitted the
curves. I found

z= 00866, p= 1'19268, g= — 19268.
n= — 037685, c= 661662, d = 6°6645.
