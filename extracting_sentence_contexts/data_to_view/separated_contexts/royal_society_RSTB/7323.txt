Evans (1go1) for Eoperipatus states that ‘the mesoderm seems to be formed exclusively
from the primitive streak’, and ‘that the endodermal elements are derived from the lips of
the blastopore, with which the endodermal layer is continuous, and that they pass from that
position through the outer layer of yolk’. A similar general account is given by Sheldon
(1889 a) for Peripatoides novae-zealandiae. The supposed evidence of invagination from the
lips of the ‘blastopore’ (the mouth-anus) consists of (1) the continuity of the ectoderm and
endoderm at this point, and (2) the fact that the endodermal layer is not complete when
the first somite is formed and the mouth-anus is undivided. Both these features can be seen
in Peripatopsis and are no proof that endoderm arises in this way. Evidence has been given
above (p. 518) in support of the view that the mouth-anus is not concerned with endoderm
formation, a conclusion confirmed by abnormal embryos which lack a mouth-anus yet
possess a normal endodermal layer.
