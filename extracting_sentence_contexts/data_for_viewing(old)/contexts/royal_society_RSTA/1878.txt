Darwin’s contribution is overwhelmingly shaped by the scope of his ability to accommodate
diverse facts and disciplines. His synthesis spanned anatomy, embryology and systematics, which
comprised the bulk of the life sciences of his day, and united them under a single conceptual
framework. It then went further by incorporating biogeography, behaviour and palaeontology.
Darwin made predictions, but the role of prediction in the success of his theory was small by
comparison.

7. Fact versus theory

The different public receptions of the periodic table and Darwin’s theory can be attributed to one
running afoul of religious beliefs while the other does not, but there are other reasons as well. The
foundation of the periodic table is the elements and their properties. All elements are retrievable
and the assessments of their properties can be replicated.

The foundations of Darwin’s theory were less concrete. For example, Darwin presents his
argument for the palaeontological record as a history of life in two chapters, the first of
which is entitled ‘On the Imperfection of the Geological Record’. He describes the odds of an
organism ever being found as a fossil as improbably small because it may lack tissues, like
bones, that easily fossilize, and may not live in an environment conducive to fossilization. An
animal that dies in a moist forest will quickly decay without leaving a trace. One that dies
