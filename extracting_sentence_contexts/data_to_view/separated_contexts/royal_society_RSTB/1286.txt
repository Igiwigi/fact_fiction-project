* The actual state of the transpiration water is not, so far as we are aware, known; still, from #
fact that sap forced up by root-pressure contains some dissolved air, it may be inferred that the transp

Cordyline rubra showed that it contained a small quantity of dissolved gas. MR. H. H, DIXON AND DR. J. JOLY ON THE ASCENT OF SAP, 569
