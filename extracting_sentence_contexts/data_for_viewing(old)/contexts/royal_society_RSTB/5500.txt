The next section shows the extreme limit of a vertebra. On the dorsal side there is
the massive supradorsal with the cartilaginous dorsolateral. Below the supradorsal
in the middle region is a trace of the roof of connective tissue arch of the next vertebra.
Articulating with the post-zygapophyses are the pre-zygapophyses of the next vertebra.
On the two dorsolateral sides of the centrum there are fibrous connective tissue cells.
There are cartilaginous cells within the osseous ring of the intervertebral element, which
is the ball, and the outer ring is the socket (fig. 32).

The Adult Atlas (first) Vertebra. (Text-fig. 1.)

That the so-called odontoid process is the intervertebral element is certain, from the
fact that it is a projection of the vertebral body, on the two lateral aspects of which
there are the cups for the articulation with the occipital condyles. On the anterior
portion of the dorsal surface there is a median ridge-like structure, the neural spine,
whose posterior wall forms the supradorsal. There are two lateral shelf-like projections
of the neural arch, which are formed by the projections of the connective tissue arches.
There is a slight ventral outward projection, which is formed by the parapophysis,
which is almost at the middle line of the centrum. The posterior end of the centrum
has a cup for articulation with the ball of the next vertebra. :

An Adult Typical Trunk Vertebra. (Text-fig. 2.)

The neural arch has the neural spine from the beginning of the vertebra up to the
supradorsal element ; the latter structure forms the posterior boundary of it. There
