There was a fair amount of cloud
in the mornings, but the afternoons and nights were clear in the majority of cases. Mt. Meruoca, 2,700 feet high, about 6 miles to the N.W., was a collector of cloud, its
summit being frequently veiled in mist. In spite of its cooler climate, the summit
would thus not have been a suitable eclipse station, and, in fact, nothing of the total
phase of the eclipse was seen from it. 12. Although water was generally scarce, we were very fortunately situated as we
enjoyed an unlimited supply of good water laid on at the house.
