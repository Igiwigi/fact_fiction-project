Pain is often characterized by a motor response (e.g. parts and when these body parts are touched by a

facial expression of pain) and frequently has a clear q-tip (no pain). Moreover, activation of the somato-

somatic/sensory as well as an affective/motivational with pain intensity. In addition, region of interest
