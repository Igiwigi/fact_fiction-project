Stations E,, E,, E, and D, lie near the loop of fig. 5 and at ot = 0 their currents are
directed towards the English coast, thus agreeing with fig. 4. At of = 90° E, has a
strong southerly current, E, a weaker southerly current and E, practically zero current,
while D, has a small northerly current. These observational facts agree well with
fig. 7. Station Da, has a westerly current at of = 0 and a northerly current at ot = 90°,
which facts agree well with figs. 4 and 7 respectively. Station Da, has a flood parallel to the shore at ot = 75°, which is in good agreement
with fig. 11, and the behaviour of a progressive wave.
