We only mention the process as it affords such a rapid and easy means of
expansion. The results obtained by its use can always be obtained at a little greater
length by an elementary process of step-by-step substitution.

ยง 6. Before proceeding to the consideration of association and so forth, it seems
necessary to discuss somewhat fully the general relations subsisting between the
frequencies of different groups, and the number of independent frequencies of any
order. Suppose, for example, we are dealing with three attributes (A, B, C and
their contraries), Twelve second order and eight third order groups can be formed
from these. It might appear then that if the frequencies of the second order groups
were given, there would be a sufticient number of equations to determine the
frequencies of the third order groups. As a matter of fact this is not so; the twelve
second order frequencies do not form independent data, and the question arises, How
many are independent ? or, in general, how many independent frequencies or groups
are there in the mth order groups produced from n variables? i.e., how many of these

mth order frequencies must be given (nothing else being given) in order that the
remaining frequencies of the same order may be calculated? These questions are
considered in the next section (II.). In Section III. correlation or association and its
measurement are treated ; Section IV. deals with probable errors; and in Section V.
some arithmetical examples are given of the methods and results previously discussed.
