A reversal of position
between the appendage and somite on the one hand and the neuromere on the other
has enabled these appendages to retain their functional connection with the mouth. I
suggest, therefore, that all the elements necessary to form a complete segment are present
in the first segment of the head in Pieris, a pair of somites, a neuromere and a pair of
limbs. With regard to the epipharynx the facts that it arises as a paired structure, quite
as distinct as the premandibular appendages, and that it possesses a small double mass
of mesoderm which passes into it as it develops into the median lobe, may tempt one
to the conclusion that another segment is concerned here. It must be remembered,
however, that the mesoderm of the epipharynx is secondarily separated from the
