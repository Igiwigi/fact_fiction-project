With the following well authenticated instances of this
kind that have come under my own observation, I shall close
this Lecture. The mare that in the first instance had a foal by a quagga,
and afterwards three in succession by a Persian horse, all of
which were marked like the quagga, can in no other way be
explained than through the influence of the mother upon its
young. In proof of the fact, paintings from life of all the indi-
vidual animals have a place in the Royal College of Surgeons
in London. There is also an account of the occurrence stated
in the Philosophical Transactions, in which all the particulars
are detailed communicated by the Earl of Morton, to whom
in the first instance the mare belonged. A lady while pregnant with her tenth child, the former
nine being perfectly formed, was robbed in the dusk of the
evening near Woolwich by an artillery man who had a hare
lip the fright occasioned by the alarm was 80 great : that
she did not recover from it for several days ; when brought
to bed the child was found to have a hare-lip.
