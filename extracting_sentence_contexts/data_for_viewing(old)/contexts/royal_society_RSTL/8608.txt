sys the brain is placed in a cavity or lacuna, prolongations of which accompany the
viscera. He figures no regular water-yascular system apart from this. It is especially
to be remarked that, alnost invariably, obseryers who figure the nervous system of
Planarians distinetly, do not in the same animal give the vascular system, and vice versd.
Thus Oscar Scum (Zeitschrift fiir wiss. Zool. x. 1859, p. 29) speaks of secing in a

Planarians, and indeed all worms in which a special blood-system is not differentiated
off from the primitive vascular system or body-cavity, the nervous system lies within
the vascular canals and spaces ; and in Bipalivm, as will be een in the 8equel, what,
was believed to be the neryous system was found to occupy such a position.

It is an interesting fact, and I believe new to science, that there exist Planarians
which contain in their body-fluids hemoglobin, I detected this substance by means of
the spectroscope in a small Planarian, apparently a species of Derostomum (Scuanpa,
Neue wirb. Thiere, Band i. Hiilfte i. Taf. i. fig. 8), which I found infesting in considerable
abundance the surface of the integument of an echinoderm, one of the Clypeastride, Ag.,
which abounds at Suez. It is possible that the red colour of many other Planarians is
due to the presence of hemoglobin. A red tinge may be seen at the base of the eye of
