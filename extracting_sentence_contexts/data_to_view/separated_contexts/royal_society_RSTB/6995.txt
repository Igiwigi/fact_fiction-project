It seems likely, therefore, that a split into two Linnean species took place between the
horizons 16 ft. and 16 ft. 6 in. above the coal. This effect may be the result of evolution. In view, however, of the rapidity of the change and the fact that division into a large and
small shell group has been found as low as the Pot Clay Coal, at the base of the Lower Coal
Measures, the writer suggests that we may be dealing with the gradual migration of a cline
which split into species ‘up river’ or towards the shore.

(a) Small shells (figure 17)

The variation is comparatively limited. Nearly all the shells are referable to C. fallax
(figure 19L) or C. aff. fallax (figure 19K), while some approach C. cf. sulcata (figure 19 M, N). Typically, the lower border is gently curved, and a slight carina may be developed in the
more dorsally arched casts.
