Nusspaum
& supposed that the plane of separation (his first cleavage plane) is parallel to the
longer axis of the ovum, and later, rotates and becomes transverse. I carefully
investigated the earlier stages from this point of view, and convinced myself that no
rotation whatever occurs. In the position of the polar bodies my evidence is at
variance with the statements of NusspAum, and the facts are, I think, conclusive in
favour of my own view. The polar bodies, it is admitted on all hands, are formed at
the anterior pole; if rotation occurs the polar bodies which adhere closely to the
protoplasm, must, as Nusspaum assumes, share in the movement, and in the case of
ova with oblique basal planes should show an obliquely situated polar body. Fig. 48
