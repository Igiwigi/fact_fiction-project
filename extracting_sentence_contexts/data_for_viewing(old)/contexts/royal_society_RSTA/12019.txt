The percentage errors here are well within those usually passed by statisticians.
If they are slightly larger than what we have found in previous cases the source of
the error is not far to seek. We have combined both male and female cases, but the
distributions of enteric fever for both sexes are not the same. The fever curves for
either sex differ in some cases markedly, although less for enteric fever than for
diphtheria, for example. We have thus, in reality, a compound curve. I have found
for about 700 male cases only a percentage error of about 5.*

Another point needing notice is the question of antenatal cases, which may at first
strike the reader as absurd. The closest fitting curve of Type I. runs, as we have seen,
1°35 years about before birth, and gives three antenatal cases. Three antenatal cases
(or, indeed, 9 in the case of the curve of Type III.) is a very small percentage of
8689 cases, and not of importance from the statistician’s standpoint. But the fact
that a curve starting before birth gives a better fit than one starting at birth, is
significant, and there is every probability that a curve starting from about — ‘75 year
would give a still less percentage error than one from 1°35 year or from birth.t

In dealing with mortality curves for infancy I have found it impossible to get good
fitting theoretical curves, without carrying these curves backward to a limit of
something less than a year. 'The “ theoretical” statistics thus obtained of antenatal
deaths seem to be fairly well in accordance with the actual statistics of maternity
charities. In vital statistics therefore we must be prepared in most diseases for small
percentages of antenatal cases and antenatal deaths, and it is just possible that theory
in this matter will be able to indicate lines of profitable inquiry to the medical —
