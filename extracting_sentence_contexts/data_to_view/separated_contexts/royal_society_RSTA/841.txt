To the extent that it is becoming cheaper to pursue
more ambitious mitigation by substituting renewables, the mitigation gambles become pointless

undercut by technological developments with their own powerful momentum. A commitment to
poverty alleviation is no reason for less ambitious mitigation—in fact, quite the contrary—but a
reason for just international burden-sharing. Data accessibility. This article has no additional data.
