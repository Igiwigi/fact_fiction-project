It is almost superfluous to point out that the density of the water skin will be
subject to fluctuations ; it is, in fact, a variable dependent upon three others ; namely,
the pressure, temperature, and hygrometrie state of the adjacent air. The difticulties and uncertainties associated with the variations in the weight of a
water skin were, it is believed, successfully met and overcome by the simple device
which we now describe.

(6) B, Of the Methods used for the Removal of Water Skins—Some observers
may be considerably surprised to learn that anyone should attempt to weigh accurately
glass vessels without previously drying the air within the balance case in the usual
manner. This departure from a time-honoured, orthodox, and, as we shall try to show,
sometimes worse than useless custom, was, on our part, of deliberate design.
