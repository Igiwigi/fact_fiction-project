It is practically possible to
measure both the long and short columns to the same fraction of a degree, and an
error of ‘001° in a column of 20° is of much less relative importance than in a
column of 2°. In the case of the resistance box, on the other hand, the relative
accuracy of measurement is undoubtedly greater in the case of the smaller
resistances, A 10,000-ohm coil cannot be measured with the same order of accuracy
as one of 1000 ohms. This is partly due to difficulties of insulation in the winding
of the coils themselves, and partly to the fact that wire finer than 2 or 3 millims.
cannot be drawn and covered satisfactorily. As a consequence, high-resistance
galvanometers are necessarily less efficient than low-resistance instruments of similar
construction. The best high-resistance coils are constructed of a number of lower
resistance coils in series, as in the Thomson-Varley slide-box, which permits a higher
order of insulation than winding in a single coil.
