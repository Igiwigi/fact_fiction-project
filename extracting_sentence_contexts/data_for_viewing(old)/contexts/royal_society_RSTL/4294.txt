matter containing a good deal of resin. The syrup should then be introduced into
a flask, and treated with a large quantity of ether, which dissolves the orcin and most
of the colouring matter, leaving the pseudo-orcin undissolyed. A more economical
proceeding is to mix the syrup with three. times its bulk of alcohol. After standing
for a couple of days the pseudo-orcin crystallizes out in small shining erystals. These
crystals should be collected on a cloth filter, pressed, and washed with cold strong
spirits, which removes most of the colouring matter and any adhering orcin. On
being crystallized twice or thrice out of strong boiling spirits, the psendo-orein is
obtained in large shining colourless crystals. Pseudo-orcin may be obtained in still
finer erystals by crystallizing it out of water, in which liquid it is exceedingly soluble,
much more 80 than in spirits. I have obtained it from its aqueous solutions in
curiously truncated pyramids, nearly an inch broad, having a brilliant diamond
lustre. In fact, there are very few organic substances which form more splendid
erystals than psendo-orcin. I sent a quantity of these crystals to Professor MILLER
of Cambridge, who was 80 kind as to determine their measurements and optical pro-
perties. 'The following are the results of his examination :â€”
