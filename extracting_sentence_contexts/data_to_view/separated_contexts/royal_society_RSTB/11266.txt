Indeed, there is mounting
evidence for the involvement of sensorimotor systems in the processing of con-
crete words (e.g. [5,6]), and many theories of conceptual representation assume
a tight coupling between sensorimotor and conceptual systems (e.g. [7]; for a
review see [8]). It is much harder to make the case that processing of abstract
words such as truth is aided by these systems. In fact, abstract words are most
commonly characterized in the literature by the absence of physical or spatial
grounding: ‘Roughly speaking, an abstract concept refers to entities that are
neither purely physical nor spatially constrained’ [9, p. 129]. While challenging, it is important that we investigate representation and pro-
cessing of abstract words in order that we understand this essential characteristic
of human cognition. In our view, concreteness is a continuum ranging from
highly concrete concepts, which are typically external entities that can be per-
