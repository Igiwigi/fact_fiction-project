It is important to realize that = S
temporal organization of organisms to an ever changing the environmental variable the animals respond to (the cue)
environment. Such plasticity is enhanced by its mechanistic and the environmental variable that affects their fitness (the
complexity, whose many parts and multiple oscillators offer selective agent) do not need to be the same. In fact, very often
numerous ways of adjusting internal clock time, and thereby they are different as the phenotype is shaped at a different
