On the assumptions we have made the size of a genus is not an absolute measure of

its age, for chance enters largely into the matter, but it is an index to age. On an
average, within a homogeneous group, genera of 2 species are older than monotypes,
genera of 3 species older than genera of 2 species, and so on. It is therefore of importance
to determine the frequency distribution of ages for genera of a given size, i.e., to determine
what proportion of genera of species, with assigned values of Â¢ and z, are likely to possess
any assigned age. ;

We will first take the limiting case when time is infinite, since the
time is simply to truncate the frequency
at age v.

The required expressions for genera of 1 and 2 species have, in fact, already
been given under the integrals of equations (9) and (11) at the beginning of Section IT,
