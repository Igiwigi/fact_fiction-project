The revival of animals after complete desiccation was first observed amongst the
tifera by LEEUWENHOEK in 1701, and his observations were subsequently repeated by
y other naturalists during the next half century, the principal of whom were Hi,
KER, FONTANA, Gozf, Corrr, Orro MULLER, and the ABBf SPALLANZANI. The discovery,
y NEEDHAM, in 1743 of the young Anguillule in what appeared to be diseased grains of
eat*, added another animal to the list of those possessing this remarkable power of
wviscence after prolonged periods of desiccation ; and very shortly after this the number
s still further increased by SPALLANZANI discovering that, in addition to the Rotifera
ufts of moss, there were certain Anguillule and arachnidal animals (< Sloths”) found
the same situation, all of which were endowed with a similar tenacity of life.
—Dne of the most interesting facts that has yet been made known concerning the s0-
Bled Vibrio tritici was ascertained by Barter. He discovered that s8ome of these
mals contained in diseased wheat, given to him by NEzDHaM in 1744, till possessed
[2h power of resuming all their vital manifestations, after immersion in water, in 1771 ;
t is to 8ay, after a period of twenty-seven yearsf. This is the longest period on record,
several observers have failed to restore them after much shorter intervals.
