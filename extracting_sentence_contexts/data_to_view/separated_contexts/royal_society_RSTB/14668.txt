1. Introduction

Julian Huxley contended that there were ‘three major problems of Biology’ [1]:
causation, survival value and evolution [2]. Niko Tinbergen, in his famous ‘On
aims and methods of Ethology’ [1], replied to Huxley that there was in fact a
fourth: ontogeny, that is, the problem of how biological mechanisms change
over time. Tinbergen, however, admitted in the same essay that the ontogenetic
problem in the context of behaviour was somewhat difficult to circumscribe and
that its study had, as a result, a slow start in the then rapidly expanding and
maturing field of ethology. Since then, it is safe to say that the concerns of the 1973 Nobel Prize winner
have been answered.
