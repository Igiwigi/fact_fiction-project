the Standard Model, it is only the Higgs boson that has this problem of being sensitive to large
quantum corrections. All of the particles other than the Higgs boson are protected by various
symmetries: matter fields by the chiral symmetry of the model, and the force-carrying gauge
bosons are protected by the gauge symmetry upon which the model is built. We emphasize,
however, that there is technically no fine-tuning in the pure Standard Model Higgs boson mass
computation: there is no higher mass scale within the Standard Model, because it does not include
gravity or higher scales such as those derived from grand unified theories. However, we shall
proceed on the basis that the hierarchy problem is pointing us in an interesting direction if we
take it seriously as a problem, expecting that gravitational degrees of freedom will induce a huge
quantum correction to the Higgs boson mass.

If we examine the correction to the Higgs boson mass shown in figure 1, we note an interesting
fact: the large corrections have an different sign for the first contribution compared to the second.
In fact, this is a property of quantum field theory: fermions give a negative sign, whereas bosons
give a positive sign. Supersymmetry provides a mathematical reason for a large cancellation
between the two diagrams, by imposing a symmetry on the quantum field theory between bosons
and fermions. For every fermion degree of freedom, supersymmetry imposes that there must be
a corresponding bosonic one, with identical mass and couplings. Thus, for instance in figure 1,
supersymmetry imposes tp = iy and 2 =Ã© [3].

In fact, fermions in the Standard Model (the quarks and leptons), each have two degrees of
freedom (left and right handed, meaning that their spins are in the same direction or in opposite
direction to the motion of the particle). When we supersymmetrize the model, we end up with
two scalar bosons for each Standard Model fundamental fermion. The supersymmetric scalar
