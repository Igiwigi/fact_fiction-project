realised. They are based on the differences as found and consequently must contain
a considerable number of chance coincidences, although for the reason given above
(p. 863) the number will be less than that given by the probability formula. In the
present state of our knowledge there is little to decide where they occur. Ina few
cases the existence of a coincidence may be evident and be traced. For example, the
lines 15923, 19113, in the AuX linkage which differ by 3190°13, or apparently by a
modified a link, really belong to a doublet of the D type, referred to in more detail
later. They are respectively the D,, and D,, terms. The satellite D,, is 19738,
which gives the normal separation 3815°54 with 15923. They are in inverse order—or
their formula gives negative values. The satellite separation D,,—D,, = 625°41 and
as it chances 3815°54—625'41 = 3190°13. Thus the apparent a link is not really so,
it is a pure coincidence. It is further possible that links attached to these lines may
reproduce other examples of this pseudo link. As a fact 15923 has a separation
17243 to 33165°51 and 19113 a link e = 17254°40 to 36367, which suggests a spurious
link a = 8202°25 between 33165 and 36367.

In many cases it is easy to see that a spurious link must occur somewhere in a
certain region. For instance, if a linkage. starting from one series line runs on into
that of another by a certain sequence of links, one at least in that sequence must be a
chance coincidence. There are several cases of this, but astonishingly few when
regard is had to the enormous number of links which exist. One chief’ difficulty in
settling the true sequence in a case like this is due to the existence of the link
