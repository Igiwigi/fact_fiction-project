‘3 All these effects are found in practice. 8 Further deductions are that the steady change of resistance is proportional to the
‘Bintensity of the sound, while the periodic resistance change in (2) is proportional to the
amplitude. These conclusions are confirmed by experiment.
& A description is given of the effect to be observed when the microphone is tilted at
= various angles, and the observed facts are compared with what would be expected from
Sthe results of experiments with steady air-currents. gy Finally, an account is given of some experiments which exemplify the use of the
3 Hot-Wire Microphone for observing the intensity and distribution of sound. The work deseribed in this paper forms part of gn investigation commenced in the
A Munitions Inventions Department, and continued later at the Signals Experimental
Establishment, Woolwich.
