Tilting Towards the Operated Side—When the artificially postured frog is slowly
tilted towards its operated side, it may exhibit one or other of three different kinds
of movement.

A common type is one that we fell into the habit of calling “ body-lapse.” This
is a movement in which the musculature, especially of the shoulder-joints, yields to,
instead of reacting against, physical circumstance. It begins to occur only when
the angle of lateral inclination is moderately high. Suddenly the upheld fore-body,
not collapsing, but moving parallel to the table-top, may slip a little in the downhill
direction. Each little slip (as many as three or four may sometimes occur in the
course of one single extensive tilt) ends as abruptly as it began. As a cumulative
result the arms eventually become slightly askew with respect to the body. The
fact that these body-lapses are individual and isolated, and not part of one continuous,
plastically yielding motion, raised the question whether they are indicative of
corresponding, discontinuous, labyrinthine alterations. We finally concluded that
they are purely muscular events, having no necessary relation to happenings within
the labyrinth. One reason for so thinking is that they also occur in a fully
delabyrinthized animal.

Two features of body-lapse are worthy of passing mention. Its occurrence
provides additional proof that of themselves the muscle receptors of the frog are
insufficient to cause compensatory adjustments to gravity disturbance. In the
matter of their negative influence on the remaining labyrinth, the head displacements
associated with body-lapse resemble those associated with deep breathing or with
croaking (see footnote, p. 246). : ;
