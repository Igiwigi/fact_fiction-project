weight of a bar, an inch square, and of this height, would be
about go millions of pounds; so that if the weight be 10
pounds, and the line of bearing an inch long, the thickness at
the distance a must be one three millionth of an inch; and
supposing the angle a right one, a must be +3555; and
making a= 1, we have the whole compression of the edge
within the depth of an inch +3555 HL 4244001; and this
logarithm being 15.26, the correction becomes equal to the
360 thousandth of an inch. If the bearing were one tenth of .
an inch only, the compression for both the opposite edges
would become +3Zz5, Supposing that they retained their elas-
ticity, and underwent no permanent alteration of form. In
fact, however, the edge must be considered as a portion of a
minute cylinder, which will be still less compressible than an
angle contained by planes; and the happy property, demon-
strated by M. LarLace, will prevent any sensible inaccuracy
from this cause, however blunt the edges may be, supposing
that the $teel is of uniform hardness in both. Believe me, my dear Sir, very sincerely yours,
