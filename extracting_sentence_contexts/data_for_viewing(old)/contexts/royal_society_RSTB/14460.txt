How do people make causal judgements? Consider the diagram shown in
figure 1a. Ball A and ball B enter the scene from the right, collide with one
Tobias Gerstenberg another, and ball B goes through the gate. Did ball A cause ball B to go through
e-mail: gerstenberg@stanford.edu the gate? Intuitively, the answer is ‘yes’. But why?
Reaching causal verdicts about scenes like this one requires going beyond
what actually happened, and considering what would have happened in a
relevant counterfactual situation [1-3]. If ball A had not been present in the
scene then ball B would not have gone through the gate. The fact that this counter-
factual is true suggests that ball A caused ball B to go through the gate. By the
same logic, in figure 1b, ball A did not cause ball B to go through the gate.
Here, ball B would have gone through the gate even if ball A had not been present
in the scene. Gerstenberg et al. [4] show that a model based on counterfactual
simulation accurately captures people’s causal judgements about physical
events like this one (see also [3,5]). But are counterfactuals really necessary, or
might it be possible to explain causal judgements differently? One such possibility
is that another kind of cognitive operation may suffice: hypothetical simulation.
But what is the difference between counterfactual and hypothetical simulation?
A counterfactual simulation involves observing what actually happened,
mentally travelling back in time to imagine a change to what actually happened,
and then simulating how this alternative possibility would have played out. If the
