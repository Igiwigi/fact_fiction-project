(v) Fifth Section.—3116- 632 to 3485-345 A.U.

In this section only one series of rotations was available, since the extinctions on the
films of Series A could no longer be read ; but the wave-lengths had been established by
three or four independent observers, so that the intensities of the lines as well as their
wave-lengths could readily be checked. Large deviations between the observed and
calculated rotations could generally be traced to the fact that two or more lines were in
such close contiguity that they could not be read separately. The average differences
between the observed and calculated rotations in this section (which included three
completely unidentified readings) were as follows :—

Series B. 66 lines.

Casual errors ob eee = + 0-006°/mm.

Systematic error .. me = — 0-001,°/mm.

Series C. 18 lines.
