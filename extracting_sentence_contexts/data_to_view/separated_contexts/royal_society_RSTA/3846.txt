It is in every
way probable that these ridges saved the village, and a careful examination of the
difference in the appearances presented by the country to the north and to the south
side of each of them convinced us that they had intercepted the violence of the blast,
and protected the region behind them. The moving mass of sand and gases was too
heavy to rise freely in the air when it passed over Richmond, but clung to the surface
of the ground, and lost much of its energy and dropped most of its solid matter before
it could surmount an obstruction. The blast was, in fact, only the lighter and upper
portion of the avalanche of dust. The rampart of the Somma wall, which faces the crater on its northern side,
undoubtedly protected the country behind it, for the denser portion of the cloud was
too much loaded with dust to climb this ridge. Its main force poured over the lower
south lip of the crater with the avalanche of sand.
