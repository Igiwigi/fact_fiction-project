This is especially shown in
Experiments 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.

4. The action is slightly increased by blackening both cylinder and pillar.

5. The remarkable fact observed by M. Tuore that a fine fibre of silk brought
near the suspended cylinder produces rotation has been verified in Experiments 27
and 28, and with other fine fibres in Experiments 19 to 26.

6. That the rotation is produced by a reaction between the cylinder and pillar, and
not between the cylinder and the source of radiation, is shown in Experiments 54 to 75.
