Here, however,
in the infants, and especially in the younger of the two, this layer is much thinner
than in the cases of pronounced chronic insanity, on the other hand, in the first four
cases on the list, the same relation exists as that shown in Table III. (fig. 51). This is
probably to be explained by the non-development of the purely psychic regions of the
cortex in infants as, owing to the fact that the afferent tracts develop before the
efferent, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the psychic portion of the visuo-:

sensory cortex would develop earlier than the corresponding region in the neigh-
bouring purely psychic portion of the brain. In the cases of chronic insanity, on the
other hand, the same relation should, and does, exist as regards the respective depth
of the conjoined first two layers in both regions of the cortex. From the measure-
ments of layers 4 and 5 in Table IV.
