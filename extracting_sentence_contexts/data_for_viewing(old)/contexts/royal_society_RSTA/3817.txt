e-mail: tsirlin@sarc.botik.ru Development of applied thermodynamics stems princi-
pally from work of Sadi Carnot [1], which was associated
with the investigation of limiting possibilities of
thermodynamic systems. For years, these investigations
were focused on problems of maximum thermal
efficiency or the efficiency of energy exploitation in
heating and cooling machines, separation systems,
chemical processes, etc. In idealized modelling applied
in past years, maxima of efficiency have been achieved
in reversible processes in which fluxes of energy and
components in the system are sufficiently small (in
fact, infinitesimal) or when the coefficients of heat and
mass transfer (and, possibly, other transfer coefficients)

are sufficiently large. Needs of atomic energetics, in which investment costs are large whereas
the value of consumed fuel is small, resulted in searching for a cycle in a thermal machine which
would correspond to maximum power in this machine, for given coefficients of heat exchange
with thermal reservoirs.
