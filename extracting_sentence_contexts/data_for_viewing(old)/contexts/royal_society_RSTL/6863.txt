molecular velocity, as nitrogen and carbonic oxide do, an interchange of molecules also
takes place without any change in volume. With gases opposed of unequal density and
molecular velocity, the permeation ceases of course to be equal in both directions.

These observations are preliminary to the consideration of the passage through a
graphite plate, in one direction only, of gas under pressure, or under the influence of its
own elastic force. We are to 8uppose a vacuum to be maintained on one side of the
porous septum, and air or any other gas, under a constant pressure, to be in contact with
the other side. Now a gas may pass into a yacuum in three different modes, or in two
other modes besides that immediately before us.

this hypothesis in recent times and first applying it to the facts of gascous diffusion, is fairly due to Mr, Hurararn,

1. The gas may enter the vacuum by passing through a minute aperture in a thin
plate, such as a puncture in platinum foil made by a fine steel point. The rate of
passage of different gases is then regulated by their specific gravities, according to a
pneumatic law which was deduced by Professor Jon Ropison from TormcnLLs well-
known theorem of the yelocity of efflux of fluids. A gas rushes into a vacuum with the
velocity which a heavy body would acquire by falling from the height of an atmosphere
composed of the gas in question, and supposed to be of uniform density throughout.
