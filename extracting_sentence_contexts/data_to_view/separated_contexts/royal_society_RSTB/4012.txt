EXCITATORY PROCESS IN THE DOGâ€™S HEART. 217

The Endocardial Lining as a Whole. Two facts of chief importance seem to be established. (1) The lining of the
ventricular wall is always activated before the pericardial surface, and our results
show that the interval between the internal and external activity is controlled by
the thickness of muscle at the corresponding point. A simple muscular spread of the
excitation wave from within outwards, with uninterrupted penetration of the several
muscle layers accounts for the phenomena observed.
