This \
integral may be otherwise verified. 4

Tf the boundary L be enclosed within any outer convex boundary, let ds be the differ-
ential of the length of the latter, «, Þ the inclinations of ds to the tangents from it to L,
then we find in the same manner,

ſ(cos « + cos B)4s=2L,

the integral extending all round the outer curve. I mention this merely as an illustration ; it is in fact easy to show independently that
L=fcos «ds=\ cos Bds.
12. If an infinite number of random lines pass between two convex areas, the density
of their intersections will be (as in art. 9) at any point R in the Fig!
