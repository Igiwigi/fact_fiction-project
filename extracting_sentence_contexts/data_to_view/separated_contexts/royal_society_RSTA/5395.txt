As well as the tremendous
technical difficulties associated with experiments on these high-temperature
systems, one is also forced to confront the basic conceptual problem. Namely, in
systems at temperatures far above absolute zero, how can we distinguish between
a metal and a non-metal? And, are the different density-dependent behaviours
understandable in ‘simple’ models for the metal-non-metal transition, especially
in light of the high temperatures and of course recognizing the fact that these
are disordered liquids and vapours? In figure 7, we highlight the evolution of the density-induced non-metal
to metal transition for the high-temperature fluids of the chemical elements
hydrogen, oxygen, rubidium, caesium and mercury. The conductivity data as
