1. Introduction

According to traditional wisdom, calculation is, in right-handers, a left hemi-
sphere function, with a crucial role for the parietal lobe. ‘Primary acalculia’
e-mail: carlo.semenza@unipd.it was in fact, as described below, mostly observed in parietal lesions to the left
hemisphere; ‘secondary acalculia’ may instead be a consequence of either
language or visuo-spatial disorders following damage to the left or the right
hemisphere, respectively. Maths was indeed believed to be represented and
processed on the same side as language, even if the two functions are largely
independent of each other (this specific issue has been addressed previously
by clinical studies [1-3], and via neuroimaging [4]). Noticeably, when language
is represented on the right, as shown in the very infrequent case of right-handed
people with aphasia following a right hemisphere lesion (a condition known as
‘crossed aphasia’), calculation too seems to be represented on the right [5],
although less prominently than in people with left hemispheric specialization
for language [1].
