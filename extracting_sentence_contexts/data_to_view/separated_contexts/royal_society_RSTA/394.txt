In particular, if we consider in the latter case a detector
edge positioned at the centre of the beam, so that C} =0.5, the only difference between the two
formulae is a factor V2, ie. SNRangle peak =v2. SNRÂ¢I peak: This is explained by the fact that
two images, instead of one, are used in the calculation of the refraction angle map, thus doubling
the photon statistics and accordingly reducing the noise. We now turn our attention to the analysis of the edge positions optimizing the SNR of a
single EI image (see equation (3.4)). We consider, to this end, the set-up available at the ID17
beamline of the ESRF [18,19].
