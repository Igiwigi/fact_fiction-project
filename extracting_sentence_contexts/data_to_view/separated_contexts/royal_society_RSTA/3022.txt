It is not even realized in the relatively weaker
sense of considering a juxtaposition of all possible values relative to all possible systems. The
reason is that the very fact that a quantity has value with respect to some system is itself relative
to that system [12]. This weak realism of relational QM is in fact quite common in physics laboratories. Most
physicists would declare themselves ‘realists’, but not realists about y. As one of the two (very
good) referees of this paper put it: ‘In physicists’ circles, Schrédinger’s is mostly regarded as a
mere instrument’.
