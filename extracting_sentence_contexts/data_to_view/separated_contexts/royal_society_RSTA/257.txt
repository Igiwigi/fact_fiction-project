But a small travelling roadshow, including one Nobel Laureate, can
still be assembled to deny it. And there are many other examples: from MMR
vaccination in the UK to the essential reality of anthropogenic climate change
(albeit with remaining uncertainties about the timescales and magnitudes of some
nonlinear processes). Furthermore, it is often difficult to make an accurate assessment of risks,
and even when an accurate assessment can be made, many people’s subjective
assessment is very different from the objective facts. Such subjective attitudes
can create their own reality and impede effective policy actions. Even a policy of ‘label and let the consumer choose’ has its problems.
