Assume that S is integrally closed, R a v-Z.P.I. ring, and that the quotient field of
GS/q is separable over that of R/(qo KR), for every minimal prime ideal q of S. Then e = S:d. For any minimal prime ideal p of R, R, is a Z.P.I. ring, and the same is therefore true of
G,. (In fact, both are principal ideal rings.) By the theory of quotient rings (Grell (19274);
also in ยง13 of Grundy (1942)), every non-null prime ideal of S, has the form qG,, where q
is a minimal prime ideal of G such that qn R = p. It is also a standard result, formulated
more exactly in (4.4), that the structure of the quotient fields of R/p and G/q is the same as _
that of the fields R,/pR, and S,/qS,. Thus R, and G, satisfy the conditions of Lemma 1.
