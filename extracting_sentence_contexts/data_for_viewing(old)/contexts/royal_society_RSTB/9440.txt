while C57BL/6 mice carry the IGHJ1*03 gene.

After the determination of the apparent germline gene
repertoires of both strains, the VDJ rearrangements were
re-aligned against strain-specific germline gene sets, and the
rearrangement frequencies of each of the genes and putative
genes were determined. The IGHV gene rearrangement
frequencies are included in tables 1 and 2, the IGHD frequen-
cies are shown in table 3, and the IGH]J frequencies are shown
in table 4. The average lengths of IGHD genes within the VDJ
rearrangements were also determined, and are included in
table 3. Calculation of the average length of each gene
within VDJ rearrangements is complicated by the fact that
some rearrangements include very short IGHD genes. It is
impossible to be confident of any alignment of a human
IGHD gene that is shorter than 8 nt [34], and alignments of 8
or more nucleotides were therefore used to gauge the extent
of exonuclease activity within the mouse. Such IGHD align-
ments were seen in 63.2% of BALB/c and 62.7% of C57BL/6
VDJ. The average lengths of these IGHD genes within VDJ
rearrangements are also shown in table 3, and this shows that
the loss of 3 or 4 nt from each end of the IGHD gene is
common. The majority of IGHDs were found in all three RFs.
Although RFs were not equally used in the productive reper-
toires of C57BL/6 (RF1 15.4%, RF2 7.7%, RF3 76.9%) or
