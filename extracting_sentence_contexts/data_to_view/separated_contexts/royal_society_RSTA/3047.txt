The signal arrived at a time when the detectors were behaving well and the noise was
Gaussian. After matched filtering with the best-fitting template from a library of waveforms that
incorporate our best understanding of inspiral-and-merger physics [17], the combined amplitude
signal-to-noise ratio was 24. This is a 240 detection, by this measure, and the probability of a false
alarm is something like 10-°°, even allowing for the fact that millions of templates would have
been tested against the data in the search. But the abstract quotes our confidence at something
like 50. This much more conservative figure comes from the fact that the detector noise is not
always Gaussian, but is characterized by random ‘glitches’, which are bursts of interference that
originate mainly within the detector.
