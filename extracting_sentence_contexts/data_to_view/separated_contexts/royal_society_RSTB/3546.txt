Ill. Tae Grant Freres REGARDED AS NoN-NERVOUS ELEMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF
THEIR STAINING REACTIONS. The denial of the nervous nature of the giant fibres has depended, in at least three
cases, upon the fact that the methods usually adopted for staining ordinary nerve
cells and fibres failed to stain these peculiar fibres. According to Semper (1876, p. 202, footnote) Leydigâ€™s fibres are not true nerve
fibres, as is apparent by their reaction to stains; those of Nais* do not stain with
gold chloride and stain with carmine only with difficulty. Semper regarded these
tubes as containing an easily coagulable substance, which is not blood, because the
coagulated fluid reacts to stains quite differently to blood plasma and cells are never
seen in it.
