As this relation retains the same form whether referred to-fixed or to moving
space, it expresses the FarADAY-MAxwe-t law that under all circumstances the
electromotive force referred to a circuit, fixed or moving, is equal to the rate of
diminution of the magnetic induction through its aperture.

The expressions for the electric force thus determined are merely formule for the
kinetic reaction of the disturbed medium, which must be at each instant balanced by
the forces of the elastic strain which is the other aspect of the eflicient cause of
| t he phenomena. ‘Thus they do not imply any conclusion that in all material dielectiies,
whether vaseous or liquid or solid, the motion of the matter produces an electric effect
which is objectively the same for all; the equations referred to moving space apply in
fact quite as readily to the free ether itself as to a moving material medium, provided
currents as well as the electric force are referred to the moving space.

Tn any actual problem, the quantity p, which enters into the electric force, is made
determinate by means of the circuital condition to be satisfied by the currents
hroughout the dielectric : as a matter of convention we may if we please take to
nclude the electric potential of charges on the conductors which are the terminal
aspects of the elastic strain in the dielectric, but nothing essential is perhaps gained
y such a course, unless in the case of slow movements.

110. If however we were to adopt, on the lines of Hrtmuoutz’s theory of 1870, a
lifferent procedure and assume that the vector (F,G, H) is a physical entity as
d stinct from a mathematical expression, and so assign a definite physical formula for
