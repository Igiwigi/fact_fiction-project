We cannot yet distinguish between the two.

3. Climate proxies

The Earthâ€™s past climate is recorded at the finest temporal resolution in the deep ice cores of both
polar regions and interfacial and grain boundary premelting [41-43] plays an important role in
the state of the climate signal [4446]. This is due to the fact that meteoric ice (snow fall that
accumulates to form the ice sheets) is by definition polycrystalline. Hence, at the boundaries
between individual crystals (where two grains abut or at the veins and nodes where three and
four grains come together, respectively) soluble impurities segregate providing high-resolution,
long-term archives of climate proxies (e.g. an atmospheric trace-constituent). Major efforts by
international teams (e.g. [47]) remove kilometre scale ice cores to analyse for their record of
the state of past climates.
