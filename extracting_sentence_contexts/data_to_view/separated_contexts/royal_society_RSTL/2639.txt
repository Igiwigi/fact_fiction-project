It is here that in all
the extent of the Pyrenees, reckoning from the Atlantic, the granite first constitutes
the ridge or geographical azis of the chain, though it invariably forms (where visible)
the geological axis. From this group of granitic mountains the country slopes in
three directions, to the east, north, and south. It may, in fact, be viewed as the true
termination of the ridge, which gradually descends by subdivided ramifications to
the Mediterranean, the chain being split by the valleys of the Tet and Tech running
east and west, which are not to be viewed as longitudinal valleys, but as valleys ra-
diating from this the most easterly centre of elevation, just as the transverse valley
of the Arridge radiates to the north, and that of the Segre to the south-west. It is
important to keep this in view in examining the magnificent circuit of hot springs
which surrounds this granitic nucleus. The system of the Canigou, though perhaps
