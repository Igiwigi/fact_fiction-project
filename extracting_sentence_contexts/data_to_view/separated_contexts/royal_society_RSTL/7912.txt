The maximum shearing-force for
support at the middle is therefore 3825 tons, a little greater than in the previous poxi-
tion, and we have

Maximum hogging-moment=3825 tons x 54 ft. =206,500 foot-tons (in round numbers); or abont
=displacement x {5 of the length. This moment is considerably under two thirds of the maximum sagging-moment pre-
viously found for this ship ; and we have in this fact an illustration of the statement
made above respecting the difference existing between the exceptional hogging- and
$agging-strains in ships with concentrated weights amidships as compared with other
ships. In the * Victoria and Albert * we should expect to find a more striking illustra-
tion, and we really do s0. Her after body is heavier than the fore body, and its weight,
1330 tons, constitutes the maximum shearing-force, while the centre of gravity is 46
feet abaft the centre of gravity of the whole ship.
