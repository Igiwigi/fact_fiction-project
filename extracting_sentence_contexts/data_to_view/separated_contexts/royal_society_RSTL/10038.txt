The- researches
'S recorded in the preceding pages appear to us to demonstrate in a conelusive manner
'S that they are 80. Z The development of the hamal arches in the tail in these two groups is practically
A. identical ; they are formed in both as simple elongations of the primitive hemal
= processes, which meet below the caudal vein. In the adult there is an apparent
b= difference between them, arising from the fact that in Lepidosteus the peripheral parts
Z of the hzmal processes are only articulated with the bassl portions, and not, as in
-S Elasmobranchii, continuous with them. This difference does not, however, exist in
<= the early larva, since in the larval Lepidosteus the hamal arches of the tail are
E unsegmented cartilaginous arches, as they permanently are in Elasmobranchii. If,
A however, the homology between the hamal arches of the two types should still be
doubted, the fact that in both types the hemal arches are similarly modified to
* 8upport the fin-rays of the ventral lobe of the caudal fin, while in neither type are

they modified to support the anal fin, may be pointed out as a very strong argument
-in confirmation of their homology.
