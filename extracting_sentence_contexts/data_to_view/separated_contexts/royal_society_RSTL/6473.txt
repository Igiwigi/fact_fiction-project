Urea, grs. to each IÃž.......... 461 | 474 | 458 | 439 | 458 | 273 The foregoing facts prove that, whilst there is no average increase in the elimination
of urea during the period of actual treadwheel labour without food, there is a small
increase in the production on the whole day when ordinary food is taken ; but on some
occasions this increase is not eliminated on the day of labour, but on the following one
of rest. The proportion of urea to the weight of the body on the whole period of
labour and rest combined, is 59 per cent. greater than is observed in myself with much
greater weight, less food, and less labour.
