variations in the mean distance between adjacent molecules, and in no case are they
due to allotropic modifications of the molecules themselves.

13. Carry Lea’s “ Allotropic” Silver.
In the former communication|| it was suggested that Carry Lxa’s “allotropic”
silver was in reality only finely divided silver, the division being sufficiently fine to
admit of the films being optically continuous.1 He advances** two principal arguments

} Berry, loc. cit., p. 43. The difference in structure is shown by the fact that while mercury will
diffuse slowly and uniformly in the compact film, in the leaf thin streams of mercury may be seen shooting
rapidly in all directions.

§ Bey (loc. cit., pp. 48 et seq.) has shown that a layer of exceedingly flat spheroids is generally found
on the surface of a metal.

{| It is not necessary to suppose the microstructure of the finely divided silver to be granular, as was
done in the former paper. It may be in part granular and in part amorphous.
