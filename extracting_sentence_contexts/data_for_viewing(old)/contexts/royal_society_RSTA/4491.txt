— ifF CG, then P(F) < P(G), and
— ifG C —F, then P(F UG) =P(F) + P(G).


(v) The lattice (P,C,U,n, —,X, @) is orthomodular, that is it satisfies the following condition for all
F and G in P:
orthomodular law: ifF CG, then Fu(—F n G)=G.

A detailed proof of theorem 4.1 is given in §6. Statements (i)—(iii) of theorem 4.1 follow, with
some calculation, from the definitions of ‘determinable’ and ‘proposition’. Statement (iv) follows
from the facts that P is a probabilistic frame on 9(X) and P C g(X). Statement (v) is a consequence
of Statements (i)—(iv) and theorems of lattice theory that characterize the orthomodular law.

The following notation is useful. Let M= (P,C,U,n,—,X,@). M is called the between-subject
orthomodular lattice. As discussed previously, in terms of current terminology, M has the algebraic
structure of a ‘quantum logic’, which is an algebraic generalization of the ‘logic’ described by
Birkhoff & von Neumann [6] for quantum mechanics.

The approach to modelling experimental phenomena developed in this article is expressed in =
