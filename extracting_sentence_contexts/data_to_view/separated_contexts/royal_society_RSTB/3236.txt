A constant feature in all species
examined is the occurrence of two series of bundles, at least in the fertile seeds, and
in some cases both series are represented in the seedless scales. We do not regard
the upper inverted bundles as evidence favouring the axillary-bud theory of
CrLakovsky and other authors, but we follow Excuier in regarding the inverted
orientation of the bundles as a normal feature of vascular strands supplying an
appendage of a leaf, and we see no adequate grounds for designating the cone-scale
of the Avaucariez as other than a leaf. The Structure of the Ovule and Embryo,

Our knowledge of the female gametophyte and of the embryogeny of the Araucariez
is far from complete, and through lack of material we are at present unable to add
very much to facts already known. Since the publication of SrraspurGER’s great
work* on the Conifersee and Gnetacez little has been done towards a complete
investigation of the megaspore of the Araucariez. The chief facts recorded are—
(i) the extension of the nucellus as a stigma-like beak into the micropyle,t (ii) the
sunken position of the archegonia at the base of funnel-shaped depressions in the
prothallus, and (iii) the occurrence of a fan-shaped group of covering cells at the
apex of the proembryo.
