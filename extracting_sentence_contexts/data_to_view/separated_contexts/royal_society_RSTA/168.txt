The solution to this problem may be different depending on the choice of the
adaptive grid methodology, but it is worth referring to the papers by Hubbard &
Nikiforakis (2003) and Nikiforakis (2005), which successfully addressed this issue.

n those papers, ECMWF re-analysis data sets were used to run a three-
dimensional off-line hierarchical adaptive mesh refinement model. The model
refines anisotropically in all three dimensions and even though it is not dynamic,
he algorithm that initializes the data (and keeps forcing the model) would be
he same, irrespective of the equations that are solved. In fact, as the model
adapts in time as well as in space (i.e. every fine mesh patch is integrated
at its own optimal timestep, all meshes are synchronized at the end of every
iteration), the ECMWF data had to be manipulated in a rather involved manner. Nevertheless, the algorithm had a very small CPU-time overhead and the model
yerformed three-dimensional simulations of a stratosphere-troposphere exchange
event (initialized on 17 June 1996 and final output on 23 June 1996) at an effective
resolution of 12 million cells, over a few hours on a Sun Ultra 10 workstation. Finally, we remind the reader that an operational piece of software has to
adhere to additional considerations, if it is to be of practical use; for example,
it has to be amenable to implementation on modern computer architectures.
