Let’s consider these in the light of an experiment that IBH
advocates have mustered: the experiment by Auvray ef al.
[4], discussed above (cf. figure 1). In this study, participants
find each other’s sensors, even though they themselves
appear unaware of whether they are finding a sensor or a
shadow. One could quibble about various aspects of this
example as a good example of the IBH in action (it is not par-
ticularly ‘ecologically valid’; the fact that the subjects cannot
explicitly distinguish sensor from shadow does not show that
their brains are not representing this distinction, just uncon-
sciously; etc.), but let us take it as an example nonetheless. Now the question is: what exactly does this experiment
show? It shows that coupled causal interactions between
two people are required to explain something—what is
that?
