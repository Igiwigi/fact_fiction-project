Professor MARSHALL has made the following explanatory remarks. «1f the brain, in its natural state, filled the cranial cavity as completely as water will
afterwards, it would be easy, by taking the specific gravity of nervous substance as com-
- pared with water, to estimate the quantity of brain which once occupied any given skull ; | but the fact that this is not the case, especially in regard to the base of the brain, and
the difficulty in determining the weight of the membranes, the amount of blood which
the vessels may contain, and the quantity of cerebro-spinal fluid which fills the ventricles
and all otherwise unoccupied spaces, render it impossible thus to arrive at 80 definite an
estimate as in the other way,” 5. e. by weighing the encephalon*. The present may be regarded as the first attempt to deduce with accuracy the weight
of the brain from the capacity of the skull, on any commensurate scale.
