It must be admitted that the primordial germ-cells,
at some time in the history of the race, were of functional importance and gave rise to
definitive germ-cells, even if they are now functionless. The precocious oocytes of
the 6 weeks chick would, on this view, be vestigial structures, representing the
oogenesis of some ancestral form, which have been functionally replaced in the course
of evolution by the neo-formation of the definitive oocytes. From the fact that all the oocytes, in the ovaries of fowl from 3 weeks old and


THE OOGENESIS OF THE FOWL (GALLUS BANKIVA), 135

upwards which I have examined, have completed the extra-follicular growth period,
I can say that I have not observed any neo-formation of germ-cells, in these stages,
in any of my material. It must be remembered, however, that in cases of sex-reversal,
a neo-formation apparently occurs and has been described by Gatensy (10), but this
may constitute a later differentiation of primordial elements, already present in the
region of the gonad.

(2) The Golgi Apparatus. So far as I am aware I have described for the first time, in my letter to ‘ Nature ’ (2)
and in the present paper, the Golgi apparatus of the definitive oocytes of the bird.
