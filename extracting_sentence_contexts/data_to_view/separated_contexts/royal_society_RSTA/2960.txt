The agreement
breaks down at very large values of ¢ because of the difference between the ideal delta-function
and its regularized version used in the numerical calculations. Most of the unstable modes are =
destroyed by the blowup, which is typical for PT-symmetric systems, but at small values of : 3
é the symmetric and antisymmetric modes spontaneously transform, respectively, into weakly
oscillating breathers or stable symmetric GS. Unstable antisymmetric states also transform into mea)
weakly oscillating breathers in narrow regions near their existence boundary. :

A noteworthy finding is that the stability region at ¢ > 0 for the antisymmetric (first excited) [4
state is much larger than for the symmetric GS, which is explained by the fact that the splitting DN
potential favours antisymmetric configurations, and disfavours symmetric ones. The stability 2S
region of the symmetric states shrinks with the increase of y, while for the antisymmetric states it DS
originally expands, but eventually disappears at a critical value of y. As usual, the stability area .
of all the states shrinks with the increase of their total power.
