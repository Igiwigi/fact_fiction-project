The agreement between the torsion and cylinder tests will be seen to be very close. The flexure tests give only slightly lower values, and the impression is very strong that

shear stress is, in fact, the determining factor in failure. Itremains, however, to consider
why the above ratios are greater than unity, in other words why the shear stress at
failure should be greater when the stress distribution is not uniform. It has already been stated, in the introduction, that the idea of reinforcement by
understressed material is not convincing, as it involves an action, prior to elastic break-
down, inconsistent with the theory of elasticity.
