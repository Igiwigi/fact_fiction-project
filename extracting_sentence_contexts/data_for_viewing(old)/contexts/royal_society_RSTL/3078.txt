may be communicated to a distance by the action of the intervening particles, in a
manner having a relation to the way in which the inductive forces of static electricity
are transferred to a distance (1677.) ; the intervening particles assuming for the time
more or less of a peculiar condition, which (though with a very imperfect idea) I have
several times expressed by the term electro-fonic state (60. 242. 1114. 1661.). I hope
it will not be understood that I hold the settled opinion that such is the case, I would

rather in fact have proved the contrary, namely, that magnetic forces are quite inde-
pendent of the matter intervening between the inductric and the inducteous bodies ;
but I cannot get over the difficulty presented by such snbstances as copper, silyer,
lead, gold, carbon, and even aqueous s0lutions (201. 213.), which though they are
known to assume a peculiar state whilst intervening between the bodies acting and
acted upon (1727.), no more interfere with the final result than those which have as
yet had no peculiarity of condition discovered in them.

1730. A remark important to the whole of this investigation ought to be made
here. Although I think the galvanometer used as I have deseribed it (1711, 1720.)
is quite sufficient to prove that the final amount of action on each of the two coils or
the two cores A and B (1713. 1719.) is equal, yet there is an effect which may be con-
sequent on the difference of action of two interposed bodies which it would not
