As the magnetic curves approach to-
wards O, there will still be two tangents possible, the point of contact of one becoming
continually nearer to O in the angle P'"M Y, and the other in the angle RM P", till,
as before shown, they coalesce continuously in O. The branch lying in the angle
P'MY, therefore, has M O P" for a rectilinear asymptote, as the branch in the oppo-
sIte region had M P.

It would probably be difficult to establish, from any considerations furnished by
the properties of the magnetic curves, the utmost angular extent to which the infinite
branch lying in the angle O MQ extended from the asymptote M O P”. But recur-
ring to the fact furnished by equation (82.), that for every value of 8 which gives one
real value of » there is also a second real value; and as for all values of 0 comprised
between &«, and &,, or within the angular region 'T O U, we have shown that there is
one real value of 7; and, with the exception of the angular region M O W, (WO W'
being the tangent to the magnetic curve at O,) we have established two values ; it
follows, that for completing the whole series, and fulfilling the conditions of (82.),
there must be a second value of 7 for every direction which a line can take in the
angle P'OW'; or, which is the same thing, the infinite branch will touch the line
OW", but can never pass to the right of it ; that is, it lies wholly in the angle P'OW,
and never meets the line O W' again after it passes through O.

The course of each curve of verticity is thus fully made out : and it now appears
that each is confined within specific and peculiar angular regions referred to lines
drawn from O through the magnetic centres of force. Though in itself the diyergent
system is not required in the present physical problem, yet the separation of them as
constituents of the equation (76.) was essential to enable us to ascertain the separate
branches of the convergent one, which we have yet to discuss in its application to
that problem.
