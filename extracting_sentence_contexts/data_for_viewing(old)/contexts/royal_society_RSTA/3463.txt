We also have obtained late-time HST WFC3 observations in F275W and F336W of three other
SESNe in 2016: the SN IIb 2001ig, the SN Ic-bl 2002ap and the SN Ib/c 2010br. The results of this
programme (PI: O Fox) and their interpretation are still preliminary. We did not detect any source
at the positions of SNe 2002ap and 2010br. However, a UV-bright object is detected at the exact
position of SN 2001ig.

10. Conclusion

As previously pointed out, we are now quite confident that SNe II-P arise from (single) massive
RSGs. We have at least one example (SN 2013ej) of a possible SN II-L which may have resulted
from the explosion of a more massive RSG. Whether this trend continues requires detecting the
progenitors of other SNe II-L. In fact, the supposed ‘red supergiant problem’ [64,100] for SNe II-P
needs many more cases of RSG progenitors of whatever initial mass to determine if it is indeed
an issue. We really still have been dealing with relatively small-number statistics. At least some
SNe IIb emerge from warmer supergiants that are more ‘yellow’ than red (although, see the case
of the ‘compact’ SN IIb 2008ax [31,141]). A He star progenitor has been confirmed for one SN Ib
(iPTF13bvn) so far, with still no detection yet of an SN Ic progenitor. The SN IIn/LBV connection,
at least in our opinion, remains razor thin. We have attempted various searches for the surviving


companion of the progenitor system responsible for several SESNe. The results are by-and-large
non-detections. However, in the cases of three SNe IIb, 1993], 2011dh and 2001ig, a UV-bright
object is found years later at the SN site. It remains to be seen whether in all three examples the
excess late-time UV light is, at least partially, actually due to the old SN. We clearly need many
