Consequently it appears that bilateral phenomena are
more easily elicited by exciting the corona radiata than the cortex cerebri, provided
the same care is employed to avoid as far as possible in both cases errors due to
spread, &c. The explanation of this is not far to seek, and, if correct, throws more light on
bilaterality. It simply consists in the obvious fact that removal of the cortex Jays
bare a crowd of association fibres, the excitability of which is heightened by the
section removing the cortex, and that it is the spread of the excitatory effect along
these fibres to other central mechanisms in the encephalon, 7.Â¢., opposite cortex, cere-
bellum, &c., which produces the bilateral phenomenon. It is thus extremely likely
that bilateral tonus should occur after stimulation of but one corona radiata. In accordance with what we have said before respecting the influence of ether, this
reagent afforded an opportunity of testing the truth of the foregoing views, since the
influence of bilateral central mechanisms could be by this means in part excluded, and
it could therefore be seen whether or no there was a corresponding modification in the
bilateral character of the effect.
