Meyer, on p. 67 of his work, has only made a very reserved suggestion. And still this specimen has been used by others as a proof that fusion of the three pieces produce the
solid, stereospondylous, vertebrae of Mastodonsaurus and other Labyrinthodonta.

+ It is to be borne in mind that, although there is no doubt about the homologies of these four pieces
or elements, their relative positions are subject to much uncertainty. We know, as a fact, that in the
Amniota the so-called wedge-bones become attached to, and often fuse with, vertebre to which they do
not belong genetically ; we know, also, that the Odontoid forms one pbysiological unit with the second
vertebra, and we know that the first trochoid joint (see ‘ Aves,’ p. 45) is by no means always the same
morphological quantity. Ribs migrate not only on to other processes, but even on to the “
segments ; the dorsi-spinal muscles have carried these changes to the extreme. In short, the principle
of metamerism still prevails, but the primary particularistic feature of such skleral fractions as the ribs,
namely, to remain with their own particular skleromeres, with due regard also to the myomeres, is now

often suppressed by practical adaptation to new function and requirements.
