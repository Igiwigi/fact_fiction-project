A more fundamental limitation was Darwin’s repeated description of evolution as being too
slow to be visible in our lifetimes. If we cannot see evolution in action then we are hard pressed to
accept it as an explanation for the diversity of life. The invisibility barrier has in fact been breached
in diverse ways, including observations and experiments that demonstrate the act of evolution in
real time and quantify the rate of evolution [18,19] or the evolution of reproductive isolation, the
ultimate driver of speciation [20-23]. The other ‘proofs’ of evolution are as multifaceted as the
data cited to support the theory. The only missing ingredients for the general public are a broader
appreciation of these results and of what defines a scientific theory.
