whole instrument was floated in water, and one of the outer terminal wires was caused
to dip into a mereury cup at the bottom of the water, whilsb the other terminal dipped
into a ring-shaped trough of mercury surrounding the upper part of the bulb. Bat-
tery wires were connected with the two mercury cups, when the fly rotated rapidly.
On arresting the movement of the fly by means of a magnet, the bulb was seen
to rotate in the opposite direction. The movement, however, was feeble, and with
difficulty could be kept up for any length of time, owing to the friction of the
platinum wires in the mercury cups. Having demonstrated the fact of rotation,
further experiments seemed unnecessary.

Q decided manner, further experiments were tried in this direction, as it was thought
© that the results might throw further light on the theory of the movement.
