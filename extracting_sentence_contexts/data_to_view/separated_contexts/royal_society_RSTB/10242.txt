Consciousness is then seen as the results
of the ascription of such attentional states to the self. Conscious experience optimizes both information differ-
entiation and integration. Following Edelman it is a
deeply significant fact that each and every conscious
scene is both highly integrated and massively differen-
tiated [2]. Tononi has further formalized this idea
through a range of increasingly more complex complex-
ity measures culminating in Integrated Information
Theory (IIT) and its ‘consciousness index’ ®, expressed
in bits [18,62]. As a dynamical measure of network com-
plexity, © seeks to operationalize the intuition that
complexity of brain functions results from simultaneous
differentiation and integration of information by the
underlying neuronal circuits and signalling processes.
