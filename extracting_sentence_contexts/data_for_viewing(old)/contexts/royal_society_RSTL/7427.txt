the course of a few days leave only the chitinous integumentary sheath of the Nema-

The revival of animals after complete desiccation was first observed amongst the
tifera by LEEUWENHOEK in 1701, and his observations were subsequently repeated by
y other naturalists during the next half century, the principal of whom were Hi,
KER, FONTANA, Gozf, Corrr, Orro MULLER, and the ABBf SPALLANZANI. The discovery,
y NEEDHAM, in 1743 of the young Anguillule in what appeared to be diseased grains of
eat*, added another animal to the list of those possessing this remarkable power of
wviscence after prolonged periods of desiccation ; and very shortly after this the number
s still further increased by SPALLANZANI discovering that, in addition to the Rotifera
ufts of moss, there were certain Anguillule and arachnidal animals (< Sloths”) found
the same situation, all of which were endowed with a similar tenacity of life.
—Dne of the most interesting facts that has yet been made known concerning the s0-
Bled Vibrio tritici was ascertained by Barter. He discovered that s8ome of these
mals contained in diseased wheat, given to him by NEzDHaM in 1744, till possessed
[2h power of resuming all their vital manifestations, after immersion in water, in 1771 ;
t is to 8ay, after a period of twenty-seven yearsf. This is the longest period on record,
several observers have failed to restore them after much shorter intervals. Thus
7A wheat of a certain year's growth, Bavzr4 could not revive these animals after five
Sirs and eight months; whilst with that of another year he met with the same failure
Eer 8Ix years and one month. My friend Mr. W. H. Incz tells me that he has seen
Em revive from specimens of wheat which had been kept © about twenty years.” The
ing periods during which these Nematoids retain this power of reviviscence in all
;Pbability depends very much upon the manner in which the *galls” have been preserved
