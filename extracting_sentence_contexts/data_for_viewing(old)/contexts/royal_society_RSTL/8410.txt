grounds shall we imagine these imaginary lakes arranged beneath great curved lines on
the surface, as beneath the immense line of yolcanoes that girdles'the Pacific !

Why, if produced as residues of a frozen liquid nucleus, should they not rather be
scattered pretty evenly in a couche beneath the whole snrface of the earth ? But if they
be 80, then the greater part of them must be hermetically sealed up from water, or, by
hypothesis, we should have volcanoes dotted all over the earth ; and this last is equally
true as applicable to SCHALER'S liquid zone or a wriversad liquid nucleus.

220. Along such lines of volcanoes one vent or another may start into activity,
according as the crushing energy beneath supplies more heat and pulverized material
than another; and we find an explanation for the observed (or supposed to be obseryed)
fact without calling in the very crude notion that one volcanic vent relieves another, all
drawing from a. common fiery ocean or from lakes beneath. ,

221. We also see that it is but a partial view to say the volcano is a safety-valve to
the earthquake ; for the volcano is really the safety-valve for the relief from time to time
of the effects of contraction by cooling of our globe ; and there is perhaps no more
convincing consideration, indicating that the motive cause here assigned for vulcanicity
is the true one, than is found in the fact that the assigned mechanism is one of nature's
balancing adjustments, that the volcano's work is exactly proportionate to the crushing
energy of the contraction that brings it forth, and which is thus drained off, gradually
