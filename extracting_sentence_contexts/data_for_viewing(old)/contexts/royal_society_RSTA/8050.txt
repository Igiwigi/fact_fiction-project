basis of all such epidermal growths.

(2) The X-ray fibre photograph of stretched hair (8-keratin) is analogous to that of
natural silk (fibroin), whether stretched or unstretched. Stretched hair is therefore
built of extended polypeptide chains, while unstretched hair («-keratin) must consist of
the same chains in a folded state, so that the elastic mechanism is that of a reversible
intramolecular transformation.

(3) By means of “ quadrant photographs” it is shown that the molecular complex
of «-keratin stretches reversibly by about 2°% before the onset of the main transformation.

(4) The limiting elastic extensibility of all mammalian hairs is about 100° of their
initial, unstretched length. By combining this fact with the X-ray data exact quantita-
tive agreement is found by assigning to «-keratin intramolecular folds of the nature of
linked pseudo-diketopiperazine rings which open up on extension to produce the normal
zigzag protein chain.

(5) These folds (“secondary folds”) are transverse to the general direction of the
side-chains.

(6) The side-chains of §-keratin are roughly coplanar and serve to unite neighbouring
main-chains by a variety of cross-linkages, including both co-valent and electro-valent
bonds. ‘This leaves still another fold (the “ primary fold ”) in the main-chains even in’
the extended configuration and reduces the average length of an amino-acid residue to
rather less than is found in fibroin,
