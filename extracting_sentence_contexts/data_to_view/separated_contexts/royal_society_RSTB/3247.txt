(i) and (ii) We recognise the obvious agreement between the secondary xylem of
Cordaites and that of the Araucaries, but this may be expressed by the statement
that this particular type of tracheal tissue is known to be of common occurrence
among Palzozoic plants, and probably represents a more primitive design of
conducting tissue than that of the recent genera of Coniferales. In view of this
consideration, and more especially in face of the fact that the less plastic reproductive
organs of Cordaites are far removed from those of the Araucariez, we incline to the
view that PenHaLLow and others have over-estimated the significance of the

- anatomical similarity between the wood of the Paleozoic tree with that of the
Araucarie. (iii) The resemblance between the leaves of Cordaites to those of Agathis and,
it may be added, to a slightly less extent to certain species of Podocarpus (Sect. : NagetA) is fairly close as regards external form, but an anatomical comparison
reveals a much less close correspondence.
