this is termed apparent competition, because the negative
effect that two species have on each other (i.e. competition) is
not due to shared resource use, but due to a shared predator
[20]. Under classic apparent competition, increasing density
of one prey species promotes population growth of a shared
predator, thereby increasing predation on a second prey
species. In the case of parasites, the presence of one parasite
can stimulate the host immune system. If the immune response
is non-specific, it may cross-react with other co-infecting para-
site strains or species [2]. This immune-system mediated
competition thereby favours pathogens that can escape the
immune response by hiding from or being immune to its
effects. In fact, the ability to withstand a severe inflammatory
host response can favour the emergence of a parasite that pro-
vokes the immune response and subsequently benefits from
the clearing of less resistant competitors (figure 1e) [21].

How do the complex competitive interactions within the
host balance with among-host selection? Empirical work has
demonstrated that each of the mechanisms described above
can alter parasite within-host reproduction and transmission
success. However, how different mechanisms of within-host
competition affect each other and the full extent to which host
epidemiology influences parasite evolution is still an open ques-
tion [22]. Nevertheless, it is clear that the complex competitive
