cesophagus and uniting the nerve cords, The double ring is displaced so that it lies
¢ at a considerable angle with the horizontal plane of the body, this displacement
g being due to the very great hypertrophy of the upper lip and the continuation of the
= esophagus as a horizontal and posteriorly directed tube which ends posteriorly in the
g mouth. The double ring is especially developed posterior to the cesophagus, where
© it lies stretched as a double commissure between a ganglionic enlargement on
each nerve cord. In this, the commissural portion of the ring, the outer part runs
across from nerve cord to nerve cord, as a bundle of regularly arranged parallel
fibres, resembling the commissures of the typical ganglion. The fibres of the
commissural portion of the inner ring also run for the most part regularly, but
still a plexiform arrangement is very obvious. This inner ring is very closely con-
nected with the sensory surfaces of the mouth, and it also shades off into a plexus
of filaments connected with the epithelium lining the cesophagus. In point of fact,
it may be very accurately described as a local hypertrophy or condensation of this
cesophageal sensory nerve plexus, The outer ring, on the other hand, is connected

with the innervation of the well-developed muscles of this region, and may similarly
be described as a local development of a nerve-plexus connected with the musculature
of the cesophagus. Having thus established the fact that the inner ring is sensory
and the outer motor, can we proceed a step further and identify the two rings with
