This pit must once have been an exceedingly large working in the Lower Lias. The
worked area covers about 10 acres and its depth must have been considerable for, at the
north end, there is still over 20 ft. of face above deep flood water. There is, moreover,
a shaft presumably leading to underground workings in the White Lias, and the activity

was sufficient to justify the construction of more than half a mile of canal leading as an
arm from the Oxford Canal to a loading wharf. These facts indicate that it was by far the
largest of the now disused Lias pits of the district, and also suggest that its heyday of
activity was in pre-railway times. It lies in the parish of Kings Newnham, but the stream
which forms the eastern boundary of the pit and has broken into it, is the parish boundary.
It is thus actually 0-88 mile from Kings Newnham village, but only 0-39 mile from Little
Lawford, 1-08 miles from Long Lawford and 1-17 miles from Church Lawford. Workers
from Rugby would never touch Kings Newnham but would leave the road at Little
Lawford to take a path leading to the quarry. It is therefore not surprising that the locality
became spoken of as ‘Lawford’, and all the mammal remains in the Oxford geological
museum and most in Warwick Museum carry this label. Fortunately Buckland, in his
Reliquae diluvianae (1823), leaves no doubt about the origin of the actual specimens now at
Oxford, for although he on at least two occasions gives Lawford as the locality, his only
detailed reference runs as follows (p. 176): ‘At Newnham, in Warwickshire, near Church
