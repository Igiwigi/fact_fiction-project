To better detect and characterize avoided crossings for a given quantum level 1, we
better investigate the fidelity change [7], also known as fidelity susceptibility in condensed-matter
literature [12,13], defined by
1 — f(A, 5a)

(64)
For most of the spectra so far encountered in practice, as long as 54 « 1, S,, turned out to be largely
independent of 6, i.e. $,(A, 6A) © S,(A), and vanishingly small except in the vicinity of an avoided
level crossing. The independence of 6A follows in the limit 64 — 0 directly from perturbation
theory. The independence of 64 has a simple origin, namely that the first non-vanishing contribution
to fy in the perturbation expansion of the changed state |n(4 + 6A)) is of second order in 4A, a
well-known fact from quantum perturbation theory. The fidelity measure (2.1) and the fidelity

Su(, 5A) = (2.2)


susceptibility (2.2) have found a nice application in the characterization of ground states of
quantum many-body systems [12-18]. The fidelity susceptibility S,, detects qualitative changes
in the ground state very well, when they are connected to an avoided level crossing.
