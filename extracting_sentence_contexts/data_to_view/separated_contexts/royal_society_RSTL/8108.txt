D'un autre cots, de Vabsence des raies d'un m6tal dans le spectre solaire on ne
saurait conclure celle du m6tal lui-meme dans Vatmosphere du soleil ; il peut, en effet,
8y trouver des m6taux, le lithium, par exemple, qui y sont engages dans des combinaisons
qui ne donnent pas de spectre.” In the former communication I have given, I trust, the true explanation of the absence
of certain lines from the solar spectrum ; and I think in what has gone before there is
Snple evidence that the explanation advanced by MrTsCHERLICH is absolutely untenable ;
Hr at the temperature of the 8un, which is high enough to allow hydrogen and eyen

dium to exist uncombined and in a state of incandescence above the photosphere,
Mere would be heat enough to dissociate compounds, and therefore to cause the longest
Enes, at all events, of the metalloids to be visible even if they existed in combination as a
Tale, but former observers have recorded* no trace of any metalloids in the solar spectrum. 5 As further evidence that there is no chemical combination whatever in the photo-
-Zphere, the structure of the spectrum may be also instanced ; it certainly would be very
:gHifferent from what it is, did compounds exist in the solar atmosphere ; the least refran-

ible end of the spectrum would, I hold, be the more, instead of the less complex; and
on Professor YouxG has recently recorded in the spectrum of a snn-spot certain
Zppearances which might be imagined to fayour the idea of the existence of compounds
=n the comparatively cold downrush into a spot, the general facts, to say the least, seem
$0 point the other way, and in all my observations of sun-spots I have never seen any
Fhing approaching to the appearance put on by a compound spectrum.
& On this I would also remark that with our present knowledge it is not difficult to
gather from Father Seccnr's obseryations on stellar spectra, that if the atmosphere of a
Star contains compound molecules, they at once make themselves very obviously visible. Poveral stars, the spectra of which have been mapped by him, have undoubtedly, in my
Spinion, atmospheres containing compound molecules; and it may be that the pheno-
ena of variable stars may be connected with a delicate state of equilibrium in the
temperature, 80 that at one time we get the feeble line-absorption of the dissociated,
and at another the strong band-absorption of the associated elements in their atmo-
spheresF. Father SEccnr's idea that we have in 8uch stars a prevalence of spot-spectrum f,
will, T think, not hold; but this point, which is one of extreme interest, I propose
to dwell on at greater length in a future communication. In the mean time I may
remark that T am inclined to attribute spots more to an accumulation of absorbing
material at a greater pressure than to a similar accumulation at « lower temperature.
