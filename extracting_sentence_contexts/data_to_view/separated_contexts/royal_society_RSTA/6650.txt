A usual procedure is then to calculate the
a corresponding values of h, say h, and h,, from (3-1), and to obtain the value of ¢ for the given
& h by linear interpolation; the process being repeated, if necessary. A modification adopted
‘3 was as follows. Writing f = }sin 2($—8), and F = —hsin¢, where h is the value for which
4 ¢ is required, the values of f,, f2, F, and F, were calculated, and with f, = }sin 2(¢,—9),
2 F, =—hsin4,, etc., the following results are obtained, where differences are indicated by

Although this modification of the usual procedure is formally trivial, practically it effects
a considerable saving of time, particularly in view of the fact that the values of / are usually
1 or 2 figure numbers, and that the difference between ¢, and ¢, can usually be made, from
the first estimate, sufficiently small for the calculation of (3-2) to be made mentally. Numerical integration

For the calculation of the mean magnetization at a given value of h of an assembly of
ellipsoids orientated at random in the field (see table 6, § 4), the value of the integral in

(2:19) is required, namely

cos ¢ = {""cos¢ sin 0d. (3-3)
