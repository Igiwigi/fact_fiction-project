§ 12. Licur (PRELiMinary).

A great deal has been written on the opening and closure of the stomata
produced by light and darkness, but much remains to be done. For instance, but
little is known of the effect of heat as distinguished from light. Again, there is
much contradictory evidence as to whether or no the stomata of the majority
of plants close at night. There is similar divergence of opinion as to the mechanism
of the nocturnal closure, and an almost complete absence of evidence as to the
biological meaning of the phenomenon, Again, hardly anything is known as to the
diurnal course of the stomatal movements or as to its inherent periodicity. On some
of these points I hope to throw light.

The fact that stomata are widely open in bright sunshine is well known. The
following notes illustrate the difference between bright and less bright diffused light.

light (temperature 26°), One plant was shaded by being covered with thick netting
which diminished the light without affecting the other conditions,
