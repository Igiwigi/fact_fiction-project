Tab. 28) for D. stenophylla (Kunze), and by Martius (loc. cit., vol. 11). More
elaborate drawings, though perhaps less correct in detail, are those of Francis Bauer,
in Hooxer’s ‘ Genera Filicum,’ vol. 7 ; the description of them is, however, obscured
by the peculiar use of the term “indusium,”’ But the best drawings are those of
GRevILLE (Hooker and Grevitir, ‘Icones Filicum,’ vol. 1, p. 18) of D. alata,
which represent correctly the main points of structure of the mature sorus. From
these sources it is apparent that the sorus consists of two rows of confluent sporangia,
the loculi of which are separated from one another by complete septa, while they
dehisce by distinct pores upon the outer, free surface. Each sorus is inserted above
a single nerve, and between the sori, plates of tissue arise from the surface of the leat’;
these plates, which have been described as indusia, are enlarged upwards so as
partially to cover the sori (compare ‘Genera Filicum,’ Tab. 7, figs. 2, 4, 6). With
insufficient data such as these before us, and without any facts of development, we
must begin the investigation of the sori of Danaea.

The material used was of D. elliptica (SmirH), collected by Mr. Extiov, in St.
Vincent, and forwarded to me through Mr, Grorce Murray, and D, alata (Smrru),
sent to me by the late Dr. Trimen. ‘The characters of these species are well known ;
the sori were found to be essentially similar in the two species, except that the
number of loculi in D. alata is much smaller than in D, elliptica. If the sporophyll
of the latter species be cut so as to traverse the sori transversely, the outline appears
