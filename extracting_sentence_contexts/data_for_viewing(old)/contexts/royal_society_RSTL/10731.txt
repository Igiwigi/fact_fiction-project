A strip of zinc-foil of nearly the game dimensions as the strips of iron and tin last
used was tested with loads varying from 50 to 100 kilogs. A stress of 50 kilogs.

a decrease of *02 per unit, and with 100 kilogs. the foil was partly pulled away from
the clamps ; before this, however, the temporary decrease of resistance produced by
50 kilogs. was ascertained to be 028 per unit. After the accident the foil was
securely reclamped, and now three trials with 50 kilogs. gave alteration of temporary
resistance amounting to *010, 017 and 010 respectively, the load in the second of
the three trials having been allowed to remain for a longer period on the foil than was
the case in the other two trials. It was then evident that tho time during which the
load was allowed to remain on the foil largely influenced the temporary alteration
of reistance, and accordingly several experiments were made with a view to verify
this fact, which was eventually abundantly established. In one of these experiments
a load of 70 kilogs., aſter having been put on and taken off several times, was allowed

to remain on for 10 minutes, when a decrease of 0428 per unit was measured ; after
20 minutes the decrease amounted to *0557 per unit, part of the decrease produced
aſter the first 10 minutes was permanent, but a considerable part was temporary.

The foil was now tested with loads of 12 and 20 kilogs., the latter causing a decrease
of resistance represented by 300 divisions of the platino-iridium wire, and the former
180, that is, the decrease was exactly proportional to the load. From these regults it
