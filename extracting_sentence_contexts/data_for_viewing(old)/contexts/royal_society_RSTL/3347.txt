It is evident, therefore, that, except for the discovery of very faint nebulz, an object,
perhaps, of but little interest, nothing would be effected by constructing a telescope
of the greatest dimensions, unless it was at the same time proportionately perfect ;
that a mere light grasper would do nothing.

This instrument acts very powerfully on the lunar surface, and, as might be sup-
posed, shows everywhere a yariety of details not marked in the heautiful map of Ber

* In describing the appearance of these bodies, I am anxious to guard myself from being supposed to con-

and Meprer. A much higher magnifying power can also be used with decided ad-
vantage than they say has hitherto been practicable, viz. 300*: with a power of 600,
and sometimes with a power of 900, many details are brought out, not visible with
lower powers.

Were it practicable to construct a rectangular prism, reflecting as accurately as a
flat metal, notwithstanding the thickness of the glass, there should, I think, be a con-
siderable saying of light: I have not as yet had time to try the experiment, but I
