side, as is proved by the surface shelving down to form an acute edge on its
inner side.

A similar absorption may be observed in the inner whorls of the Harpa ar-
ticulata ; but it is in this case confined to the central part of the septa, and all
the coats are partially dissolved, 80 as to leave a slit between the cavities of the
different whorls. An absorption of the upper septum also takes place in some
of the Neritine, as the Neritina fluviatilis; and it was on a character. derived
from this circumstance that DE MonTrort established the latter shell as a
genus under the name of Theodozus.

These facts distinctly show, that as the animal enlarges the mouth of its
shell, it absorbs in a greater or less degree the substance of the inner whorls.
'This process of absorption, besides furnishing the animal with calcareous matter
towards the enlargement of its shell, gives more space for the lodgement of the
body, and renders the shell far lighter to carry; and these advantages are
gained without in the slightest degree detracting from its strength, as the
outer whorl and spire, which are alone exposed in shells of this form, remain
at least as thick as in most other shells.

In many other univalves, the animal, before depositing the laminz which form
the inner part of the mouth, absorbs the outer layer of the penultimate whorl,
as is evidenced by the ridge with which that part is often surrounded. This is
particularly the case in the various species of Turbines, as in Turbo coronatus,
