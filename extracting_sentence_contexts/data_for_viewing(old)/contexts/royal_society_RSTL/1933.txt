OF THE MEDULLA OBLONGATA AND SPINALIS. 637

- It was a 8ingular mistake to imagine that the 8ame conelusion could be Just

mal deprived of its encephalon. 'The facts are these: in the entire animal,
sensation and voluntary motion, functions of the cerebrum, combine with the
functions of the medulla oblongata and medulla spinalis, and may therefore
render it difficult or impossible to determine those which are peculiar to each;

limbs connected with and detached from the spinal marrow.

The operation of all these various causes of muscular contraction may be

parts of the nervous system. But there is another function the phenomena of
