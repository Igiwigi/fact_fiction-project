So great a development of the trophoblast maternal circulation with so complete an
absence of fetal villi and of foetal mesoblastic tissue in connection therewith is more
akin to the condition in the Rodents (though in them the area of the greatly
thickened trophoblast is restricted to a cap), and in Erinaceus and man which it
resembles in being formed over the whole surface, though in them there is an early
penetration of the allantois. In the human ovum (Peters (78)), there is at a much
earlier stage a similar vascularisation of the trophoblast, but here already the
mesoblast of the foetus has penetrated, carrying within it foetal blood vessels.

I should like to emphasise the following facts: (i) the extreme tenuity of the
trophoblast, where it separates the maternal blood supply from the allantois and yolk
sac vessels; and (ii) the apparent absence of all protoplasmic continuity between
trophoblast and somatopleur; and (iii) the fact that a layer of trophoblast and
trophospongia completely surrounds the embryo, thereby entirely cutting off any
secretion that might be produced by the uterine glands. All these tend to show
that at this stage the whole of the nourishment received by the foetus is received
direct from the blood of the mother.

There is a definite pigment (iron free) along the advancing edge of the trophoblast,
and in some of the adjoining stroma cells, just as occurs in the corresponding position in
the placenta of rabbit or hedgehog. I have not been able to find either glycogen or fat.
