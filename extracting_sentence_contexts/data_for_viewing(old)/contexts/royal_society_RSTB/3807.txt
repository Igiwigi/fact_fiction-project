resin canals, but I have also found resin tracheids in the root of Pinus and in the
seedling and cone axes of this genus, not connected with the resin canals. They
show the same morphological and chemical forms of the deposit in these regions as
in the Araucarines, and I consider their presence here a retention of the primitive
condition which is found in the Araucarineze and the Cordaites.

The vertical resin canals of the pine alliance are in intimate association with the
medullary rays, these canals forming an anastomosing system with those which occur
in the latter. Their intimate association with the rays is a very natural one when it
is considered that the ray is the source of the preservative in the ancestral forms
which are devoid of ligneous resin tissue in their secondary wood. This is indicated
also by the close association of the resinous tracheids with the medullary ray in the
Araucarinez and Cordaiteze and by the fact that when a parenchyma cell replaces all
or a portion of a septated tracheid the parenchyma is always in very intimate
association with vertical series of medullary rays, a feature which is very noticeable
in studying tangential sections. Krrscu (1911) has recently propounded an
ingenious theory to explain the intimate association between the parenchyma of the
ligneous resin tissue and that of the medullary rays. He studied the pines chiefly,
and considers that the tissue of the vertical resin canals has been proliferated from
that of the rays. There is no doubt that the ray has had a great modifying influence
on the production of the vertical resin tissue, and perhaps even in the most highly
organised forms it does give of its cells to the building up of this tissue. It is not
conceivable, however, that in the Cupressineze, for instance, the vertical series of the
resin cells replacing a tracheid could have been proliferated from different uniseriate
medullary rays and been so concentrated on one tracheary element as to wholly
