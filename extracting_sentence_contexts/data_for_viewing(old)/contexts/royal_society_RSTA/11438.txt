These are errors much beyond those of the determinations, which have probable
errors of about ‘17 to ‘18 centim. Rawon, since he is using MANOUVRIER’S method
must: be supposed to be measuring the tibia in the same manner as Rowet, e., with
the malleolus and without the spine. But even supposing he had included the spine,

it could not make this great difference.* That there is some substantial error is
evidenced by the fact that tibias of these dimensions would give a reconstructed
stature for French males of 168°2 centims. instead of 165 centims., and for French
females of 158°9 centims. instead of 152°3 centims. Anon himself, on the basis of
Manovuvrter’s method, forms the estimates of 166°8 centims. and 159°5 centims,
respectively,—the latter, at any rate, a quite impossible height for the French female
population.

(10.) We are now in a position to write down the reconstruction formule for
living stature from dry long bones ; they are the following :—
