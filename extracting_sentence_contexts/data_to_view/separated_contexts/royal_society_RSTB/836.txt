4 and 5, int. dorsal cells), the cells of which give off processes to the anterior
commissure, and are also connected by a dorsal series of arcuate fibres with a third
group of cells on the outer dorsal edge of the anterior ganglionic swelling (iid., ext.
dorsal cells). These external dorsal cells, though abutting on the external cells of the
ventral sense plate, yet differ from them in size and in the fact that from them a bundle
of fibres passes through the ganglionic plexus to form the anterior part of the anterior
commissure (fig. 4). The posterior part of the anterior commissure is composed of
fibres which traverse the ganglionic plexus and pass directly out as part of the out-
going nerve bundle (fig. 5). These decussating fibres thus divide the plexus of each
anterior swelling into dorsal and ventral portions, of which the latter is finer and
denser in character.
