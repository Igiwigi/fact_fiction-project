The breadth of the whole of this phosphorescent area is
| that it 8ubtends a very considerable finite angle at the patch of tinfoil, the semi-
<Svertical angle of the cone of rays being from 20* to 30%, Now in this case the patch
pf tinfoil is 80 small that it may in considering the direction of the resulting molecular
ms be taken to be a point, and thus we see that the molecular streams from a
:>mall elemental axea would, if unaffected by any other circumstances than those
= sarily present in a tube, pass off in all directions comprised within a solid angle
Sof finite 8ize (depending probably upon the degree of the exhaust and the violence of
e discharge), swrrounding the normal in an approximately symmetrical way, 2.e.,
>Zforming a right cone of which it is the axis.* We are not able to speak definitely as
to the intensity of the streams in the different directions. Those that proceed strictly
ally are probably the most intense either from the greater density of the streams
or the greater velocity of the particles, for we find that there is a very bright patch in
-Sthe centre. But this may be partly due, as we shall see, to the fact that the patch of
tinfoil has a finite though small area. A more difficult matter to account for is the
[apparently sharp limit which bounds the phosphorescent area on its outer side. Tt is
difficult to imagine that there can be an abrupt limit to the angular extent of these
Â© molecular discharges.
