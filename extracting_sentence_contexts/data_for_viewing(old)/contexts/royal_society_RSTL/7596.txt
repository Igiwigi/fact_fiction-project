z sufficed to deyelope symptoms of decomposition in this gun-cotton.

= The behaviour of this specimen led to an examination of seyeral samples of Stow-
& market gun-cotton, portions of which had been employed in the heat-experiments
= described in Table IIL. of this Memoir, and which have since been exposed to diffused
£ daylight, in loosely stoppered bottles, for about 24 years. Three among them which,
2 when first examined, were found to undergo decomposition after exposure for a few
S minutes to 100*C., were elected for re-examination, and they all perfectly resisted
AQ decomposition upon long-continued exposure to that temperature.

It thus appears definitely established that the stability of gun-cotton is importantly
increased by long-continued exposure to diffused daylight. An examination into the
cause of this interesting fact is now being prosecuted, and the results promise import-
antly to strengthen the confidence which is already placed in the permanence of gun-
cotton.—June 1867.
