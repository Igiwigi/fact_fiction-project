was not sufficiently great to induce bleeding into the cavity.

According to my observations, the severity of the procestrous process tends to
diminish with each successive dicestrous cycle in the rutting season. Sometimes in a
late procestrum it would appear probable that Period (3) is not reached at all, but

that the congested vessels subside without any rupture. But the matter is compli-
cated by the undoubted fact that in one part of the uterus a more advanced stage
may be reached than in another part of the same uterus. Bleeding into the uterine
cavity, so far as I have seen, is more frequent through the cotyledons than between
them, and is commoner in the case of large cotyledons than with smaller ones.

I have never seen any denudation of stroma during the sheep’s procestrum. The
lumina of the glands during this period tend to become still wider, while the glandular
secretion may increase in quantity.

(4.) Period of Recuperation and Pigment Formation.—The characteristics of this
period (as indicated in sections through the mucosa) depend upon the severity of the
changes that have occurred in the preceding period, not only in the uterus as a whole,
but in the particular part of it under consideration. Where bleeding into the uterine
