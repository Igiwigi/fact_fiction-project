Now, it will be seen on referring to my tables, that for these values of þ the
differences there recorded are small. Nothing is said in NEUMANN's paper as to the
method adopted to determine the values of þ' and þ”, the angles of refraction of the
ordinary and extraordinary rays. In fact, they are both indeterminate, seeing that the
experiment, was made with white light. These are the only other experiments made
to test the theory 80 far as it concerns the refraction of light. The same paper of NEUMANN's contains a series of experiments on the position of
the plane of polarization of light reflected from the surface of the crystal under various
circumstances, the results of which are compared with theory.
