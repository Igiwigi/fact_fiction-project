Observed local temperature
enhancements of 5% in the chromosphere were reported and thought to be evidence of dissipation
of mode-converted Alfvén waves driven by upwardly propagating magneto-acoustic oscillations. Alfvén shocks are predicted to form in regions with high negative Alfvén speed gradients [38]. In
this case of the nearly horizontal outer umbral fields, the volume expansion of the magnetic fields
and the fact that the density does not drop off steeply means a negative gradient in the Alfvén
speed can exist. The study by [37] motivated us to search for oscillatory signatures in highly
inclined magnetic field geometries, even though our choice of feature being a polarity inversion
line is a very different environment that of the outer umbral field, we have an opportunity to
characterize the transverse velocity oscillations. The purpose of this paper is twofold.
