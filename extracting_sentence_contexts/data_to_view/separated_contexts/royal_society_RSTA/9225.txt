The curve on the left hand of fig. 2 represents the humidity of the atmosphere at
different heights. It is reproduced here for two reasons, firstly, the extreme dryness of
the air at 1100 metres (the humidity being only 20 per cent.) shows that the air really
had blown off the land as is shown on the chart in fig. 1; and, secondly, because it
shows that changes in the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere are propagated
upwards in the same way as changes in temperature. Bends in the humidity curve
occur at the same heights as bends in the temperature curve. ‘This is in fact to be
expected, for it is evident that the reasoning which was used to deduce the lang

of water vapour into the atmosphere. Temperature-height curves, similar to that shown in fig. 2, were traced for all the
kite ascents which were made from the “ Scotia,’ and most of them did have bends in
them. In all cases in which it was possible to trace the air’s path a bend in the curve
was found to correspond, either to a change from heating to cooling (or vice versd) of
the surface air as it moved along its path, or to a sudden change in the rate of cooling
when the air crossed the sharply defined edge of the Gulf Stream.
