The
whirling speed may, in fact, be taken as that resulting from the combined effects
of the heavier pulley and the shaft. On this assumption, the calculated whirling
speeds in the above four experiments would be (see § 44, Experiments 110, 109) 3056,
3056, 2600 and 2600 respectively, and the percentage errors would be + 5, + 6°2,
+7, and + 3°4, instead of + 4°4, + 8°7, + 4°7, and + 6°4,

46. The discrepancies between the observed and calculated results are accounted
for by the fact that the empirical formula—viz., N,N./,/(N,? + N,°)—upon which the
resulting calculated speeds are based, is not strictly accurate. In the case, however,
of two or more equal spans with pulleys on each span, that formula gives calculated
results Jess than the observed results and, therefore, erring on the right side. This
is apparent from Experiment 130-140, but it might also be proved by considering the
case of two equal spans with a pulley placed in the centre of each span.
