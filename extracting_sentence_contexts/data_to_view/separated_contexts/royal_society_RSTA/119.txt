In the beginning of the simulation, the average interaction force is largest for : S
stiffer particles, causing a faster relaxation towards an ordered packing. In agreement with the : Ss
observations made so far, the standard deviation of the interaction force indeed increases when : S
the particles become stiffer, where the perfectly rigid particles have the largest standard deviation. 1S

At the end of our simulations, the ratio of the standard deviation and the mean of the
interaction force is lower for softer particles. This fact confirms the picture that in the rigid particle
system narrow chains with a relatively high interaction force span the whole system, while the
particles in between these chains have a relatively low interaction force. Adding softness to the
particles allows them to dissipate more efficiently such strong forces, as suggested by their smaller
standard deviation. When comparing figures 5 and 3, it becomes apparent that these force chains are located
mainly in between the regions with hexagonally packed particles.
