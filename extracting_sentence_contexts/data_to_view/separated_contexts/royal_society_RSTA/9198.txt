Whatever may be the
constitution of the keratins as a class, we are justified by the experimental results now
before us in assuming as a sound working hypothesis that keratin fibres, like cellulose
fibres, owe many of their properties to the repetition along the fibre of comparatively
simple units to form molecular chains. The molecular chains of cellulose and chitin* are believed to be based on the formule
(a) and (b), respectively. But we have an additional purpose in quoting these two par-
ticular chains, and that is, to draw attention to the fact that, in both, the length of the
