There exist two principal cleavages, the one easy and rather neat parallel to the plane
of symmetry g', the other less easy parallel to the base p.

The plane of the optic axes and their acute positive bisectrix are perpendicular to the
plane of symmetry. The disposition of the coloured rings in plates normal to the two
bisectrices had heretofore induced me to look on the mean optic axes as situated exactly
in the plane bisecting the angle pA; but I have since assured myself that this was not
altogether true. In fact the results from a great number of obseryations made at 15* C.
by means of two Nicol prisms crossed at right angles in the direction in which the maxi-
mum of extinction takes place in two neighbouring sectors, taken from many plates of
Morvenite parallel to the plane of symmetry, may be stated as—

First. That the plane of the axes corresponding to red rays makes angles of about

25* 42' with a normal to p,
29? 28' with a normal to FW.
Second. That the plane of the axes corresponding with the blue rays makes an angle

of about
25? 5' with a normal to p,
