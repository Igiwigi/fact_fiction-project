Tron alloyed with Four Main Elements :—

Class 1. Iron, Chromium, Nickel, Silicon, and Tungsten.—3731 steel may be said to
show the low-temperature properties to be anticipated from a plain austenitic and
non-transformable nickel steel of similar nickel content, 27-394, but to a somewhat
enhanced degree. 3450 steel, in fact, with the advantage of rather higher nickel,
35-80%, suffers a reduction in ductility, while that of 3731 steel is unchanged. The
additional elements, chromium, 14-60%, tungsten, 3-54, and silicon, 1-62%, collec-
tively have therefore effected an improvement. Group V. Non-Ferrous Metals and Alloys :—

The behaviour of the metals in this group as regards their ductility, has already
been discussed individually, and little more remains to be said, but they may be summed
up as follows :—

Nickel.
