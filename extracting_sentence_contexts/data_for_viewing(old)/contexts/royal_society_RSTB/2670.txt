Lacaze Dutuiers described the appearance of the early pairs of mesenteries
as taking place at intervals of unequal duration. The first two pairs appear soon
after one another, then there is a longer pause before the third pair appears. The

and sixth then appear almost simultaneously. The general facts which LacazE
Duruters observed in the development of the mesenteries are, as has already been

Diagram A,—Insortion of a pair of septa after each pair of mesenteries (hypothetic) would result in
the eclocelic and entoowlic position of septa (primary cycle 12).

Durarrs) would result in the entocelic position only of the septa (primary cycle 6), m. main
