any residual methane as it would the methyl alcohol formed in passing through B.
This consideration is of importance in connection with the course of events when
methane is exploded with considerably less than its own volume of oxygen.

Any theory must, however, be capable of accounting for the following outstanding
facts, namely (1) the ultimate formation of large quantities of both carbon and steam
in the explosion of the mixture 2CH,+0,; (2) the disappearance of carbon from the
products when the proportion of oxygen in the mixtures exploded exceeds 40 per cent.;
and (3) the occurrence of oxides of carbon and steam in the products of all the
mixtures fired.

There is no difficulty in explaining, on the lines of the hydroxylation theory, the
facts comprised under (1) and (3), especially in view of the strong tendency there
would always be for a non-stop passage from CH, to CH,(OH),, without any breaking
down at the intermediate CH;.OH stage.

In the case of the equimolecular mixture, CH,+0,, the primary oxidation may thus
be represented as a single transaction,

CH,+0, = [H,:C:(OH),] = H,:C:0+H,0
ip â€”;
CO+H,,

involving the formation of steam but no separation of carbon. The facts observed
with the mixture 2CH,+0,, may also be explained on the supposition that in the
