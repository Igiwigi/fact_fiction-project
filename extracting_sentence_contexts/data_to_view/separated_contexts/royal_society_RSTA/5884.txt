For large values of the initial
enstrophy &, the asymmetric branch dominates in the sense that the corresponding Navier—
Stokes flows achieve higher values of Er(to,¢,,r) than the flows with initial data on the symmetric
branch for the same values of £9 and T. The time evolution of the enstrophy €(u(t)) in the extreme
flows with the asymmetric initial conditions tig,¢,,7 obtained for a fixed €) =200 and different
time windows T is shown in figure 3a, where we see that in these flows a much larger growth
of enstrophy is achieved than in the flow with the instantaneously optimal initial condition Ug,
obtained by solving Problem 4.1 for the same value of €. Interestingly, we note that for some
values of T the enstrophy €(u(t)) is in fact decreasing at early times before it starts to grow. A typical asymmetric initial condition to,¢,7 is shown in figure 4 where it is evident that it
has the form of three perpendicular pairs of antiparallel vortex tubes. The evolution of the flow
corresponding to this initial condition is visualized in the electronic supplementary material,
movie S2.
