These models are special for COS5BOLD simulation runs because of the rather unfavourably large
aspect ratio of their computational cells of Ax, y/Az=4 in the atmosphere. They correspond to
model d3t57g45v50gv of [29], which reports on the slowly growing p-mode amplitude of this
model.

(c) MANCHA3D

The MANCHASD [17-19] model used here is from a local dynamo simulation with a mean
magnetic field in the range of typical quiet Sun values [30,31]: (Bz) =0G, (|Bz|) *67G, (|B|) ~
110G and Brus © 140G at z=0km. While these fields should not have a significant influence
on the dynamics, the wave speeds may be modified slightly and there might be additional
dissipation. The most significant difference between the MANCHA3D model and the other
models lies in the fact that the MANCHA3D model includes ambipolar diffusion, which
causes extra dissipation of high frequency waves (v > 10mHz) in the upper photosphere and
chromosphere above 0.5Mm [17]. The MANCHA3D model studied here uses a open bottom
boundary condition with mass and entropy controls that ensure the model produces the correct
solar radiative flux. The top boundary is closed for mass flows, with symmetric boundary
conditions (zero gradient) for internal energy and density. The temperature is computed through
the equation of state (EOS).
