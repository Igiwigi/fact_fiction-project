©,9,U &c., the symbols ©,, ©,, d. contained in ©, and Dd, operate only on U. and
on the variable quantities A, B, C, &c. contained in ®, and D,.
8. If now we treat ©, as an operand, that is, perform the differentiations on the
iable quantities A, B, C which enter into ©,, we obtain

9,.99U=(33+20,2,)U,
©,.07U=(9;+3d79,)U.

At i is, in fact, upon these principles that Hresse's values of ©?U, ©%U &c. were obtained.
