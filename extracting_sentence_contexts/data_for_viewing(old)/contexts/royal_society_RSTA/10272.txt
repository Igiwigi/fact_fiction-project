the silver in question differed from those of normal silver, or, in other words, the
silver was in an allotropic form. We are now, however, familiar with the fact that
particles of normal silver, as of many other metals, are able, in consequence of mutual
electrostatic repulsions,* to keep themselves in suspension in quite pure water.
Again, we have seen that, when a silver solution is prepared by Brepie’s method, its
refractive index is that which is possessed by a suspension of small spheres, but not
of molecules, of silver in water,t and in the same case there is a strong absorption
band at exactly that point of the spectrum at which small spheres, but not molecules,
of silver in water would produce a maximum ;{ so that in this case the greater part
of the silver is certainly present in the form of small spheres. Further, if, when
prepared by deflagration, silver in suspension in water takes the small sphere form, it
is primd facie probable that it does the same when obtained by Carry Lxa’s
method,§ and this probability is increased by the fact that Cargzy Lxa’s silver
suspensions exhibited the same red, yellowish-red, and yellow colours which are
shown by Brepie’s suspensions of different densities.

We conclude that Carry LxEa’s “solutions of allotropic silver” consisted of small
spheres of normal silver in suspension.||

We should therefore expect that the films obtained by Carry Lz would be
similar in constitution and behaviour to Brripy’s “gold paint” films! and to
Farapay’s phosphorous films.** This leads us to Canny Lea’s second argument for
the allotropy of his silver ; he states :—

“The brittleness of the substances B and C [blue and gold coloured respectively, by reflected light], the
