inally, we thought the monkeys would use the opportunity to
see the action of their neighbour to choose the correct response,
but the results showed that fora majority the introduction of the
opaque partition had limited effect or no effect at all. We
decided to question the necessity of having visual access to
establish a convention by introducing five new black and
white stimuli and performing the same experiment but with
an opaque partition from the start. Visual inspection of figure 4
did not reveal qualitative differences between the experiment
with a transparent or an opaque partition (figure 4; electronic
supplementary material). We noticed that the average score
was lower and the evolution of the dominance less noisy in
the opaque condition; this is consistent with the fact that mon-
keys sometime rely on visual access, but it could also be due to
differences in the stimuli we presented since we used different
stimuli for the two experiments. Nonetheless, it appeared
that individuals could rapidly establish a convention with or
without visual access to their partner’s responses.
