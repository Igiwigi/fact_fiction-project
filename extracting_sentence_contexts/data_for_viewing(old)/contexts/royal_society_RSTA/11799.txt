Hence we can isolate that portion of the generating function which contains only
powers of ax’, It is

1+ ({)aer + (?3 ‘) (ax?) + ei" *) (acer)? + speerers :
or
al =

This fact leads as before to an expansion theorem.

Putting
(1 = aar)p : ve: ey — ayer 2
1l-—z.l—-a.. -1—aae eed ene, Lt qari + Vp (x),
& then of course
A 1 ii i
ts -l—av....1—age et — ax?)P = 1 V, (2),

=
2 and we find in succession

V, (2) =
