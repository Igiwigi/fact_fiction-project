Since the publication of the first part of my paper on Scandium,t G. Enermarp,} of
the Astrophysical Observatory, Potsdam, reasoning from the fact that the strongest
lines of the scandium spectrum are observed in the spectra of stars in diverse stages
of development, has come to the conclusion that scandium must be universally
distributed on the earth. Investigating the are spectra of 366 minerals and rocks, he
obtained the remarkable result that scandium in small quantities is actually one of
the most widely distributed earth elements. He shows that it occurs most frequently
in zirconium minerals—in beryls, titanates, columbites, and titanocolumbites of the
rare earths—also in micas; and, finally, that specimens of wolframite and tinstone
from Saxony and Bohemia contain scandium in sufficient quantity to make its
extraction advantageous.

These results of EserHarp were quickly verified by Prof. R. J. Meyver,§ Berlin
University, who, in a preliminary paper, has described experiments on extracting
