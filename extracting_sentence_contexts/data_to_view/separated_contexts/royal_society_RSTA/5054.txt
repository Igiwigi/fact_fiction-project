The Cr(II) intermediate and corresponding
bond lengths suggest the Crâ€”-N is deprotonated in the process. Again, as for the Mo systems, for this Cr system, at the high Al:Cr ratios measured, no
evidence for directly bonded Cr-Cr or halide-bridged dimers is obtained. The Cr(II) intermediate
as proposed here is in fact similar to an isolated species [Cr(CI-AIEtCl)){R-SN(H)S}]AIEtCls 5 as
reported in the literature [17]. However, this is the first time that the activated Cr species has been
measured in situ, at the relevant time scales, at the relevant Cr: Al ratios, and supports a Cr(II)-led
reaction mechanism. Further experiments, to provide further insights into the high trimerization
selectivity as displayed by this catalyst, including ethene, are now underway.

(d) Conclusions: oligomerization and time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy

The different stopped-flow procedures, i.e. time-resolved and freeze-quench, have been shown
to provide unprecedented insights in the formation of activated catalytic intermediates at real
conditions and time scales and thereby new insights into their mechanisms.
