But the weight of this objection is more appa-
rent than real, for in a physiological point of view, the contractions of tetanus differ
from those properly termed yoluntary, only in being uncontrollable by the will and
excessive in amount and duration. In violent tetanic spasm, I have myself ascer-
tained that the peculiar sound of yoluntary contraction is audible in the part, and
identical with the normal sound; and the appearance and feel of a muscle thus rigidly
convulsed, can be perfectly sijmulated for a short period by an act of volition*. I therefore conclude, from the whole of the preceding remarks, combined with the
facts and arguments advanced in my former paper, that the contraction of voluntary
muscle is not a sustained act of the whole congeries of contractile elements composing it ;
but a rapid series of partial acts, in which all duly share, becoming by turns contracted
and relaxed. King's College, London,

others, from the complexus musele, where it was ecchymosed and had lost in a great
measure its fibrous appearance.
