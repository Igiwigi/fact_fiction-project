"atifrons than in Phase. platyrhinus and Phase. vombatus, and are, relatively, still
maller i in Phasc. gigas, with a distinctive shape. But the characters of the lower pair
Sf i incisors are better shown in another mandibular specimen of the present large species.
= 'The section or transyerse fracture of the hollow base of the right incisor is shown in
late XXXVIL. fig. 2,4; the length and curvature of the implanted part of the second
"Jnolar (44) are seen in the same figure, in which ee indicates the anterior terminal line
af the outer enamel. The hinder fracture of the left ramus of the same jaw (ib. fig. 3)
-Shows the length and curye of the penultimate molar (m2 »), and the posterior terminal

Of the aboye-described instructive specimen of Phascolomys gigas little more than an
Sock of the diastemal part of the jaw is preserved (Plate XXX VI. figs. 1 & 2, 7). Fortu
Ruately, the first specimen which made known to me the fact of 80 large a Wombat having

formerly existed in Australia included 2 inches 8 lines of the diastemal part of the jaw,
which contracts rapidly to the terminal outlets of the incisive alveoli (Plate XXXIX.
figs. 1 & 2); whence I conclude that but little had been broken away from that end of
the mandible.

* Should any successor deem the differential characters of the giant Wombat of generic or subgeneric value,
as the minor differences of Phascolomys tatifrons have been by Dr. Mun (Proc. Zool. Soc. 1867, p. $15), they
may, perhaps, accept the name * Phascolonus,” having reference to the 8ize of this species, which equalled that,
of the Wild Ass.
