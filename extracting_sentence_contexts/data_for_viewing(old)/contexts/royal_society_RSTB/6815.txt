tobacco mosaic No. 6 (aucuba) protected against the yellow. Price (1935) demon-
strated a similar relation between common cucumber mosaic and a necrotic strain of
the virus. Whilst most of the work on the protective reaction of one strain against
another has been carried out on Nicotiana or some closely allied species, Kunkel (1936)
has shown that a similar relation exists between Little Peach and Peach Yellows in
peach trees. Salaman (1936, 1937@) has shown that a protection against the potato
virus Y may be obtained by prior infection with an attenuated stock of the
same.

The conclusions here presented on protective inoculation have been derived from
experiments in which many thousands of plants have been used and in which each
observation has been repeated scores of times. This superfluity of experimentation is to
be explained by the fact that as soon as the principle was firmly established, the writer
and his colleagues made use of the phenomenon as a routine method for testing for the
presence of non-virulent X strains in the potato or other plant under investigation, as
well as for replacing a severe strain by a mild one in any given mixture of viruses which
can be communicated by sap inoculation or graft. A further use was made in Cam-
bridge of the reaction as a criterion for the assignment of any given virus to the X
group. In all these respects it has proved of very real value.

As several workers in the same and other fields of virus research have recorded results
in full accord with those of the writer, it has seemed more desirable to epitomize the
results whilst enlarging on any deviations from the normal, rather than to present a
long list of protocols of the various experiments performed.
