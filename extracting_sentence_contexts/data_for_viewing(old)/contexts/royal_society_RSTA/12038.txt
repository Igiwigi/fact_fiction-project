inaccurate at higher densities. It is needful to define the initial temperature, seeing
that the results of the observations recorded in Part III. show that at densities lying
even much below 0°150 the rate of variation of the specific heat with change of
density is dependent upon the range of temperature obtaining.

It is convenient to indicate these results upon the plate. Accordingly, a dotted
line below the full curve conveys the specific heat over the range 35° to 100°, and
one below this the specific heat between 56° and 100°. A third range of tempera-
ture is dealt with in Part IIL, but its data are insufficient for plotting upon the
plate; the results for this range, 78° to 100°, would appear to lie still lower.

It is to be observed that the curvature almost dies out for the higher ranges of
temperature. In fact, the gas behaves then more nearly as a perfect gas. ‘Thus,
from 35° to 100°, the specific heat is given, closely, by

Cy = 0°1650 + 0°2300p.
