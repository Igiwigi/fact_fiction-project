Participants were not made aware of the fictional
nature of the report (nor was it explicitly labelled as real), but
were simply asked to read it carefully. After a 1 min distractor
task (a word puzzle), the test questionnaire was administered,
before participants completed the party-preference scale. Finally,
participants were asked if they had put ina reasonable effort or if
their data should be discarded, and were then debriefed; this
included a clarification that the report was fictitious.

(a) Coding of responses

Responses to the party-preference scale items were averaged
and transformed onto a continuous 0-1 scale, with greater
scores indicating preference for the Democratic Party. Responses to the memory items were awarded a score of
either 0 or 1;a mean memory score was calculated for each par-
ticipant.
