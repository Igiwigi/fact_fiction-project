BS The substance appears to be a dimethoxy-hydroxy-phthalic acid. RS That it is a true phthalic acid derivative and not an iso- or tere-phthalic acid derivative
& seems to be indicated by the following fact: A small amount of the dimethoxy-
=I hydroxy-phthalic acid was heated in an open test tube in a castor oil bath, the tempera-

é ture of which was maintained at 180°-200° C. Water was given off, as evidenced
3 by the condensation of moisture on the cool parts of the tube. A substance sublimed

g needles some of which were half a centimetre long.
