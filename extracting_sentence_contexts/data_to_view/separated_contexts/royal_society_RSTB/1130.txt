Impulses are conducted thraygh the ganglion jn either direction (pu Bots-
ReyMonD), and apparently without any modification in their time relations (Exner)
if we may suppose that this is due to the fact that, apart from the few fibres which
appear not to come into relation with cells at all, the relationship of the majority of
fibres to the ganglion cells is of the T-piece kind, as shown by Ranvier, in which
case the cell does not interrupt the continuity of the connected fibre. There is no
reason why some such sort of bypath (Gota1) may not be the basis of the con-
nection of the fibres with the corpuscular elements in the spinal cord, as it is in
certain parts of the cerebrum (FLECHSIG). There are, therefore, no anatomical data which are necessarily implied in the term
indirect as applied to these fibres, beyond the fact that such fibres come into
