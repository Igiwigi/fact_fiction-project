air-dried above-ground produce; but he has since published, in conjunction with
Dr. C. Kreuzuace, a long paper, giving a great deal of analytical detail.* It is
there explained that, for the experiments in wooden boxes (A.), and in zinc vessels
(B.), fresh washed river-sand was put in each year; but that, for those in the
cement vessels (C.), the unwashed river-sand first put in was not renewed.

72 SIR J. B. LAWES AND PROFESSOR J. H. GILBERT ON THE

As to the results, WourF called attention to the fact that with the oats and the
potatoes comparatively little increase was obtained by the use of mineral manure
without nitrogen, but that where nitrogenous manure was added the increase bore a
direct relation to the amount of nitric-nitrogen supplied. The behaviour of the
Leguminosee was, however, quite different. With these plants, the mineral manures
as a rule gave considerable increase, whilst the addition of the nitrate generally gave
little or no further increase. He remarks that these results are consistent with those
obtained in ordinary agriculture; and that it is a question whether the so-called
“nitrogen collectors” obtain all their nitrogen by means of their widely and deeply
penetrating roots, or whether they draw some of it from the air; and if so, whether
they can only take it as combined nitrogen, or also as free nitrogen? He considers
that the results of Bousstncauur and ourselves are against the supposition that they
assimilate free nitrogen. At the same time he thinks the results of Herirmecer
