Larger doses, whilst at first producing these effects, afterwards cause a condition in
which neither systole nor diastole are fully developed, the excitability declines, and
finally a feeble vermicular movement of the ventricular wall takes the place of a
co-ordinate systole. Neither calcium nor potassium are found to materially improve
the latter condition of the organ, but atropine partially relieves it. Dose for dose, pseudaconitine is no more energetic in its action upon the frog's
heart than aconitine, in fact it appears to be somewhat feebler, but exact contrast is
impossible as different organs must be used. Vagus and Venous Sinus Stinvulation. Numerous experiments, confirmed by others made by Dr, Esstemont, have shown
that the heart poisoned by pseudaconitine is, in its reaction to vagus and sinus
stimulation, altogether similar to that under the influence of aconitine (â€˜ Phil.
