This is consistent with what is known
for other insects (see Buxton, 1932, p. 297). The general explanation is that at
high temperatures, water of metabolism is produced rapidly and accumulates
in the tissues unless the evaporative power of the air is considerable ; but at low
temperatures the rate of metabolism, and therefore of production of water, is less
so that insects can live normally over a much greater range of relative humidity. But there is no evidence that this water-logging occurs in Glossina, and the facts in
Table XIII appear to show that it does not occur in unfed flies. The possibility,
however, remains that water accumulates in some organ or tissue with unfavourable
effects on the whole fly. It is also difficult to explain the unfavourable effect of very
low humidity upon the fliesâ€™ appetite, length of life, and birth-rate.
