But what would be the properties
of a universe created from a fluctuation of the vacuum? A finitely born universe would have
all possible shapes, and the Einstein equations only relate the local properties of space-time
to the overall matter density. The issue of topology of the universe relates to global properties,
possibly observable and in fact something like this could alter the images of observed galaxies
by producing multiple, fainter copies of their images. Sokolov & Shvartsman [123] and Gott [124] gave lower bounds on the size of a finite universe. Also Zeldovich & Starobinski [125] studied a flat, finite, universe as a quantum fluctuation and
concluded that it must have an approximate spherical shape to avoid a singularity.
