A detailed proof of theorem 4.1 is given in §6. Statements (i)—(iii) of theorem 4.1 follow, with
some calculation, from the definitions of ‘determinable’ and ‘proposition’. Statement (iv) follows
from the facts that P is a probabilistic frame on 9(X) and P C g(X). Statement (v) is a consequence
of Statements (i)—(iv) and theorems of lattice theory that characterize the orthomodular law.

The following notation is useful. Let M= (P,C,U,n,—,X,@). M is called the between-subject
orthomodular lattice. As discussed previously, in terms of current terminology, M has the algebraic
structure of a ‘quantum logic’, which is an algebraic generalization of the ‘logic’ described by
Birkhoff & von Neumann [6] for quantum mechanics.

The approach to modelling experimental phenomena developed in this article is expressed in =
theorem 4.1 and the fact that the lattice M differs from that of Birkhoff & von Neumann in the : 3S
following manners:

— this article’s approach is designed for behavioural modelling while Birkhoff’s & von :
Neumann’s approach was designed for modelling quantum mechanics; [4
— the lattice M has set-theoretic complementation as its complementation operation, DN
whereas the Hilbert space modelling uses an orthocomplementation operation that is [GS
not set-theoretic complementation, except for the degenerate case of a one-dimensional Ss
space; .
— for ortholattices, Birkhoff & von Neumann generalized the distributive law,

An(BUC)=(AnB)u(AnQ),
to the modular law,
