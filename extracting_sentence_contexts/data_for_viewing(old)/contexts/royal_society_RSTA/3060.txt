5. Applications

In the previous sections, we have shown how to derive a notion of locality within a global
theory starting from a primitive notion of individual agents, and their observed secrecy and
commutation relations.

The operational approach laid out here has the advantage of carrying very few assumptions
about the underlying physical theory. For example, it goes to a higher level of abstraction than
generalized probability theories by not taking for granted that all agents express their knowledge
in terms of reliable (classical) statistics about the outcomes of measurements.

Our notion of effective state spaces captures the concept of beables of a theory: aspects (or
classes) of states that can in fact be physically observed and distinguished [3,16]. Our approach


highlights that beables are observer-dependent: for example, what appears to be a gauge may
turn out to be only a local gauge [3], and the same applies to ‘global’ phases of quantum states
or yet-to-be-discovered microscopic details of some structure. We can never rule out the existence
of a more refined underlying theory, but with effective state spaces we can tailor the descriptions
used ina theory to the level of detail needed for a particular application. This goes in the direction
of the work of Colbeck & Renner [17], who showed that quantum theory is complete for the task
of guessing measurement outcomes, and further refinements would be irrelevant.

As presented here, our framework simplifies the modelling of agents for the pedagogical
purpose of highlighting the advantages of this general direction. In appendix C, we show how
