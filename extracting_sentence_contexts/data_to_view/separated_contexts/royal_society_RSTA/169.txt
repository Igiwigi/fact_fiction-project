imited to the ‘small p, large n’ scenario. This scenario also naturally reflected
he contemporary limitations of computers (the term meant people prior to 1950)
and graphical display. A natural mode for asymptotic approximation therefore imagines that n— co
while p remains of smaller order than n, in fact usually fixed. Among the most
amiliar theoretical results of this type are the Laws of Large Numbers and the
Central Limit Theorems. The former says that the sample mean of a random
sample of size n from a population has as a limit, in a well-defined sense, the
population mean, as n tends to oo.
