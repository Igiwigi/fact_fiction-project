rence of a natural pause of adequate duration. It is almost needless to state that, as this effect of the xummation
of stimuli had not been obseryed at the time when Dr, Encz published his paper, he is not to be accused of any
inaccuracy in his obseryations because he described the © secondary contractions ” as © feeble and inefficient.”

+ [As the present communication was originally accepted by the Royal Society, there here followed a
lengthy 8ubsection on © Artificial Rhythm.” A condensed epitome of the main facts which were detailed in
that subsection may be found in the already published abstract of this paper in the Proceedings of the Royal
Society, But as the new theory of ganglionic action which it is the main object of this passage to disclose
appears to mo a theory of sufficient importance to demand its final publication in as complete a form as possible,
1 have sought and obtained the permission of the Royal Society to withdraw this subsection from the proof.
And, as a further reason for postponing publication of the passage on © Artificial Rhythm,” I may state that, as
this paper is of undue length, it seemed to me desirable, if possible, to relegate a portion of it to my next paper ;
and I find that this subsection is the most suitable part temporarily to suppress, because the facts of which it
treats form in themselyes a connected body distinct from all the other facts which are detailed in the rest of
this communication ; s0 that while their omission from the present paper does not entail any further modifiea-
tion of the latter, they will admit of being introduced en masse in my next paper. When, therefore, I shall
have completed the further experiments which in this connexion I haye devised, I shall hope to communicate

to the Royal Society, in a single connected serics, all the facts and inferences which bear upon this subject—
