The first equation in (5.13)
conveys the north pole structure of the capsid (i.e. the neck) into the bulk, and the second one
expresses the symmetry of the whole configuration with respect to the equatorial plane. Equations
(5.14) and (5.15) express the requirement that the director field be tangent to each, the outer and
the inner boundary. These conditions reflect the fact that proteins in the capsid tend to enforce
tangentiality of the DNA on the capsid boundary. We now set up the admissible set for the
minimization of the energy. Let us fix 0 <¢ arbitrarily small, and define the admissible sets for
the relaxed and constraint problems, respectively,

A= {@.2) eH! (0, 5) x H1(Q):e <p <1-—e and (5.13) — —(6.15) hold} (5.16)

and

Al ={(p,9)€ Ae: V-n=0=n-V x nin Q}. (5.17)

We point out that both sets are non-empty.
