Here the male nucleus is easily distinguished by its cytoplasmic sheath, its
constantly large nucleolus and, very frequently, by its elongated form. More
serious difliculty is occasioned by the resemblance between some forms of the
tube-nucleus and the female gametes. In view of the fact that fertilisation occurs
within the male cytoplasm, it becomes especially important to distinguish the one
from the other. In well-fixed material the female nucleus is approximately spherical
in form and its nucleolus is almost invariably smaller than that of the tube-nucleus. More important, however, is the fact that before contact between the two tubes is
elfected the tube-nucleus is either already absorbed or at least shows very distinct
signs of deterioration.
