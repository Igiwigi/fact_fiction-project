(a) Metabolic interactions in the ocean microbiome

Oceanic microbial planktons, which we define as comprising viruses,
archaea, bacteria, unicellular eukaryotes (protists, fungi and algae) and small
metazoans, form a vital component of the planet as we know it. They
dominate life in the world’s oceans in terms of biomass, organism abundance
and diversity [1-3], compose the core of marine trophic networks [4,5] and
have major impacts on multiple biogeochemical cycles. The critical roles of
these organisms are mainly explained by the fact that a large fraction of them
are photosynthetic primary producers. Photosynthetic plankton organisms,
or phytoplankton, consist of unicellular organisms of diverse evolutionary
history and ecology and they lock up almost as much atmospheric carbon
(COz) as plants do on land [6,7]. While it is now generally accepted that
