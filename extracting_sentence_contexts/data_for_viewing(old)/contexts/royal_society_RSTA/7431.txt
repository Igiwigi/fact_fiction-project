ness of shape. If fins are dispensed with it may be possible to achieve stability by imparting
a sufficient amount of axial spin by some means. This is not, however, always so simple,
since, owing to the necessity of providing a combustion chamber, the length-diameter ratio
of the rocket is generally fairly high and the spin required, which depends upon this ratio,
may not be realizable in practice, or may produce stresses which are great enough to deform
the projectile. For this reason some compromise between ‘fin’ and ‘spin’ stability may be
unavoidable.

+ The assumption is made here that the jet malalinement is not appreciably affected by rotation; no
information is available on this point. Some of the tolerances connected with the gas flow produce deviations
which increase with the spin, so that the dispersion associated with irregularities in the gas flow cannot be

reduced indefinitely by increasing the spin. It is, in fact, possible that for certain projectiles rotation may
have no beneficial effect upon this dispersion.


OF THE MOTION OF ROTATED AND UNROTATED ROCKETS 569

10-6. ConcLusIon

In the preceding sections the mathematical theory of the motion of a rocket has been
worked out in detail. By means of this theory it is possible to determine not only the trajectory
during the burning period—i.e. the path of the centre of gravity—but also the yawing motion
of the projectile about its centre of gravity.
