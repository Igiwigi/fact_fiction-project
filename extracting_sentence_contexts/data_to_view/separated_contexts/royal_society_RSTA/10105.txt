et ABEL ont soumis au jugement de l’Académie, on peut voir que malgré certaines
critiques auxquelles nul travail humain ne saurait échapper, l'ensemble de leurs
recherches n’en constitue pas moins une ceuvre capitale, propre 4 jeter un grand
jour sur toutes les questions qui se rattachent aux effets des poudres.”

A paper by M. Berrneror in the same No. of the ‘Comptes Rendus’ draws
attention to the chief point upon which that eminent chemist differed from ourselves. A study of the variations in the products when the decomposition of gunpowder
was conducted under pressures widely different, varying in fact between 1 ton per
sq. inch and 35 to 40 tons per sq. inch, led my lamented friend Sir F, ABex and
myself to state that, according to our view, “any attempt to express even in a
complicated chemical equation the nature of the metamorphosis which a gunpowder
of average composition may be considered to undergo, would only be calculated to
convey an erroneous impression as to the simplicity or definite nature of the
chemical results, and their uniformity under different conditions, while possessing no
important bearing upon an elucidation of the theory of the explosion of gunpowder.”
