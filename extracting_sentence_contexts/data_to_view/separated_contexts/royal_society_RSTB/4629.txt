A section from the
central green part (Plate 1, fig. 3a) shows a periodic structure of the typical sort,
except that the chitin plates, @, are very thin and close together, their centres being
about 0°6 » apart, If the air film is a half wave-length thick, two half wave-lengths
remain for each of the plates, provided they are not double. A section from the peripheral blue area (Plate 1, fig. 3b) shows a very striking
contrast. The chitin pillars, a, instead of being over 2 in height, are less than 1 p,
becoming, in fact, merely bosses of chitin at the extreme edge of the blue border. The change of colour is no doubt correlated with this variation in height, for it is
