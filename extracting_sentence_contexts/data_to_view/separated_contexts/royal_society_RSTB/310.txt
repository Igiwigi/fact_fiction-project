This latter necessity is demonstrated by the
fuct. that, as the vascular ring increased in diameter, enclosing at the same time a

the known facts; but, should further investigations fail to support this conclusion,
which I scarcely conceive to be possible, we must then fall back upon the second
hypothesis. In doing this we must conclude that all the vessels or tracheids seen in
fig. 8 were doomed to undergo absorption, and thus make room for the young medulla
