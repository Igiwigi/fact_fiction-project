Now if we consider the surface forces produced by 8wch a
deformation in a homogeneous sphere, we find of course that there is an unbalanced
resultant force acting on the whole sphere in the direction diametrically opposed to
that of the equivalent displacement of the whole sphere. | The fact that in the homogeneous sphere such an unbalanced force exists shows that
in this case the problem is meaningless ; it is in fact merely equivalent to a mischoice
in the origin for the coordinates. But in the case of the earth snch an inequality does
exist, and the force referred to must of course be counterbalanced gomehow. The
balance can only be maintained by inequalities of density, which are necessarily
unknown.
