These relations between the viscosity of air and its pressure and temperature are the
more to be depended on, since they agree with the results deduced by Mr. Granan from
experiments on the transpiration of gases through tubes of small diameter. The con-
stancy of the viscosity for all changes of density when the temperature is constant is a
result of the Dynamical Theory of Gases *, whatever hypothesis we adopt as to the
mode of action between the molecules when they come near one another. The rela-
tion between viscosity and temperature, howeyer, requires us to make a particular
assumption with respect to the force acting between the molecules. If the molecules
act on one another only at a determinate distance by a kind of impact, the viscosity will
be as the square root of the absolute temperature. This, however, is certainly not the
actual law. If, as the experiments of Granaw and those of this paper show, the visco-
sity is as the first power of the absolute temperature, then in the dynamical theory,
which is framed to explain the facts, we must as8ume that the force between two mole-
cules is proportional inversely to the fifth power of the distance between them. The
present, paper, however, does not profess to give any explanation of the cause of the
viscosity of air, but only to determine its value in different cases.

Experiments were made on a few other gases besides dry air.

Damp air, over water at 70*F. and 4 inches pressure, was found by the mean of three
experiments to be about one-sixtieth part less viscous than dry air at the same tempe-

 rature.

Dry hydrogen was found to be much less viscous than air, the ratio of its viscosity to
