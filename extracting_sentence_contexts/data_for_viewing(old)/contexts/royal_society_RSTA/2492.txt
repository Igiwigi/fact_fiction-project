(Fokker—Planck) equation estimates the rate of change of the energy distribution n(W, t) of the
accelerated particles. In order to simplify the diffusion equation, spatial diffusion was dropped,
since it was assumed that it is not important inside the acceleration region,

The main disadvantage of the stochastic acceleration of particles through low-amplitude :23
MHD linear waves is the fact that nobody so far has proved that there is a link with the well- : S
known energy release processes during explosive solar events (e.g. magnetic reconnection in the : S
spontaneously formed current sheets). Petrosian [4] and others used the cartoon of the ‘standard’ 1p
flare model (figure 1) to link the reconnecting current sheet with the weak turbulence needed to [2
accelerate the particles. As we will see below, fully developed turbulence will naturally provide a [3
link between energy release processes and particle acceleration during impulsive events. |

The highly twisted magnetic topologies born out from the current simulations mentioned in the
previous section, lead to a different regime of turbulence with remarkably more complex mixing
