the elimination of many fictitious points, at least one of which is more than one mesh length
distant from the boundary.

Ficure 14

Fox & Southwell (1941) therefore proposed to satisfy the differential equation only at
those internal points, marked with a cross in figure 14, which involve only those fictitious
points, marked with an open circle, less than one mesh length outside the boundary. The
other internal points, marked with a closed circle, would be obtained by means of the
boundary conditions; they might then by analogy be called internal fictitious points.

The finite-difference equation at the point Pin figure 14, for example, involves the internal
fictitious points 7, Q and V, the external fictitious points S and R, and the known boundary
value B. Points 7’ and S are obtained from formulae of interpolation, for both function and
derivative, where the line ‘7... cuts the boundary; S and Q are obtained similarly from the
line SQ... and V (and U) from the line UV.... It will be noted that there are two values at 5.
This is not remarkable, since the differential equation involves the terms 04/0x? dy? + 04/dy? dx?,
and this introduces the point S' with a factor 2; the sum of the two values will therefore be
taken.

The relevant interpolation formulae are, again, the Gregory-Newton equation and its
derivative. With reference to figure 15, interpolation for the known value at B gives the

uason Wy = Wy +xAh+C,Ag+..., (B. 9)
