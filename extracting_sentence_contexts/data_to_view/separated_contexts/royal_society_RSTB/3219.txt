The apparent pumping action is merely due to the stem acting as an osmometer. Water is drawn in by the osmotic suction of the sap in the vessels through the cut
end and scraped surface more rapidly than it diffuses backwards through the nearly
completely blocked vessels at the lower end, so that ultimately a small positive
pressure is produced. The experiment in fact differs from Prrraâ€™s on the exudation
pressure of cut branches simply in the fact that the blocking at the cut surface
is natural instead of artificial, and all the exudations observed by Pirra can be
explained as being the direct result of an osmotic absorption of water by the stem or
branch. In any case the action is a slow and feeble one, and none is shown so long
as the vessels are fully open, or when the stem is immersed in a 5-per-cent. solution
of potassium nitrate.
