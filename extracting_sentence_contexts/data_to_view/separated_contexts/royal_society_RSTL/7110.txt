98 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON TSCHIRNHAUSEN'S TRANSFORMATION. The expression for the quadrinvariant was, as already mentioned, given in the former
memoir: I find that the two invariants are in fact the invariants of a certain linear
function of U, H; viz. the linear function is =VU'U+ZO'H; so that, denoting by I*,
J*, the quadrinvariant and the cubinyariant respectively of the form

I*=T(U'U +4@'H),
1*=J(U'U+40'H),

we have

where T, J signity the functional operations of forming the two invariants respectively. The function (1, 0, C, D, E'Ly, 1)', obtained by the application of TscnmNnavsrx's
transformation to the equation

(a, 6, e, d, 6X, 1)'=0,
has thus the same invariants with the function
U'U+40'H=U'(a, 6, c, d, eXz, 1)*+4&(ac—t?, ad—be, ae+2bd— 3, be—erd, ce da,

and it is consequently a linear transformation of the last-mentioned function ; 80 that
the application of 'TscnIRNHAusEN's transformation to the equation U=0 gives an
equation linearly transformable into, and thus virtually equivalent to, the equation
U'U+49'H=0,
!
which is an equation involving the single parameter =; this appears to me a result of
considerable interest. It is to be remarked that TscnIRnuatsen's transformation,
wherein y is put equal to a rational and integral function of the order 2—1 (if a be the
order of the equation in @), is not really less general than the transformation wherein

7 is put equal to any rational function xy Whatever of 7; 8ch rational function may, in

fact, by means of the given equation in &, be reduced to a rational and integral function
of the order n—1; hence in the present case, taking V, W to be respectively of the

order 2—1, =3, it follows that the equation in y obtained by the elimination of & from
the equations

(a, b, e, d, eXwx, 1)'=0,
—(@,Þ,y, Ye, 1)

(ﬆ, 8, YON, 1)®
is a mere linear transformation of the equation AU+BH=0, where A, B are functions
(not as yet calculated) of (@, 6, c, d, e, «a, B, y.3, «&,Þ,y,F).
