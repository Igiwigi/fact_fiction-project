Much of the reconstruction of retroviral lineages has centred on the well-

Additionally, conserved motifs allow easy alignment of even distantly related
proteins, demonstrating, for example, the common ancestry of retroviruses and
the many RT-containing elements found among various kingdoms of life [10].
Jamie E. Henzy Early RT-based analyses revealed the surprising fact that proviruses representing

more harbour recognizable features of extant retroviruses, despite their notori-
ously high substitution rate [11-13]. While this situation leads evolutionists to
ponder the ‘molecular clock’ conundrum [14], the fidelity of features over deep
evolutionary time also gives us a set of data that can be analysed using phylogen-
etic methods, revealing evolutionary dynamics of retrovirus—host interactions.
Phylogenetic analysis of ERV RT sequences also reveals that ERVs cluster
closely with genera of extant retroviruses. Phylogenetic trees combining RT
sequences from both endogenous and exogenous retroviruses suggest that all
known retroviruses can be grouped into three broad classes [4,15]: class I consists
of gammaretroviruses, epsilonretroviruses and the ERVs that cluster along with
them. Class II comprises the beta- and alpharetroviruses, and the lentiviruses,
