Further, the passage of the gas would increase the radiation loss from the pipe, since
it would increase its mean temperature. Both of these effects tend in the same
direction, but the second is probably small. The form of connecting pipe used by
ReG@Nnavutr would tend to minimise the above effects, but it is impossible to say by
how much,

It is probable that the true value of A lies somewhere between zero and the value
found by Reenauct. If we take A equal to zero, ReGNautt’s experiments give
0°248 for the specific heat. If we take for A the mean between the two extreme
values, zero and ReGNautt’s value, the specific heat works out to 0°242, which is in
close agreement with my own value, 0°2422. The above criticism applies not only to
the work of RreGNnautt, but also to most of the more recent measurements of the
specific heats of gases at constant pressure, and it is possibly owing to this fact that
these measurements give values for the specific heats which are so much lower than
my own values and the theoretical values.

(24) The Specific Heat of Carbon Diowide.—The carbon dioxide was supplied by
the manufacturers in iron bottles, each bottle containing about 20 Ib. of liquid CO,.
A preliminary test showed that the gas contained about 0°5 to 0°7 per cent. of air and
about 0°5 to 0°7 per cent. of water vapour. It was consequently necessary to pass it
through the drying apparatus used in the experiments on_air, the KOH tower was,
however, replaced by a tower containing crystals of cale. spar, which served to collect
any acid fumes from the sulphuric acid rocker, without introducing any gas other
than carbon dioxide. The iron bottles when supplying the gas were fitted with an
automatic pressure reducer, which prevented the pressure in any part of the apparatus
