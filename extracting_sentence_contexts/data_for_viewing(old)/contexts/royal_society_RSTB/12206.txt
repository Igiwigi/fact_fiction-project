Prediction by classification is by far the simplest approach,
with only a few design decisions to make. Ina set of N stimuli,
a classifier is trained to predict, using a brain image, which of
the N stimuli (or N stimuli classes, or N conditions) is being
experienced by the participant. There are a few constraints on
this system, the largest being that every one of the N stimuli
that appear in the test data must also appear in the training
data. This requires that more trials per stimuli be collected
(at least two) and even more if the trials are to be averaged
before analysis. It also assumes no difference in similarity
amongst the stimuli. That is, if the stimuli consist of animals
and tools, the classifier is unaware of the fact that animals
are more similar to other animals than to tools. There are If the correlation of properly matched vectors is greater, the
many classification algorithms; support vector machine 2 versus 2 test is said to have passed. There is one test per

cos (i, vi) + cos (Gj, Uj) > cos Gi, Vj) + COs (Gj, Vi). (2.1)
