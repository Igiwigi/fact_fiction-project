This value must be less than that of the criterion for similar circumstances. How much less it is impossible to determine theoretically without effecting a general
solution of the equations ; and, as far as T am aware, no experiments have been made
in a flat tube. Nor can the experimental value 1900, which I obtained for the round
tube, be taken as indicative of the value for a flat tube, except that, both theoretically
and practically, the critical value of U,, is found to vary inversely as the hydraulic
mean depth, which would indicate that, as the hydraulic mean depth in a flat tube is
double that for a round tube, the criterion would be half the value, in which case the
limit found for K, would be about 0°61 K. This is sufficient is show that the

absolute theoretical limit found is of the same order of magnitude as the experimental

of the observed facts. The State of Steady Mean-motion above the Critical Value.

38. In order to arrive at the limit for the criterion it has been necessary to consider
the smallest values of w’, v’, w’, and the terms in the discriminating equation of the
fourth degree have been neglected.
