Subsequently, the total trading volume keeps a quite constant and low level
around 1.5GW until 2h after gate opening. Thus, liquidity of 15-min contracts is high close to gate opening and drops substantially during
the first 12 trading minutes. This behaviour may be explained by the fact that market participants
initialize their positions. In the sequel, little volume is traded and thereby only minor adjustments
are made to the open positions. Generally, liquidity remains poor until the last trading hour prior
to gate closure as the forecasts of fundamentals are still relatively inaccurate.
