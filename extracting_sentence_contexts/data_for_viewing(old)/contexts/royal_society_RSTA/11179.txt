distinguish between the components ¢, and ¢,. For this purpose the direction of the
axis, rather than the plane of the equator, seems the more suitable for experiment.
For in this direction the magnetic induction and the transverse electric component
wave disappear, and we have the axial component electric wave only to deal with,
a.¢., I. only, I. and III. being not extant.

Further, the numerous theoretical singular points to which we have referred seem
to deserve, if possible, physical investigation. To do this we require to emphasise as
much as possible their distance from the oscillator. But this means that we must
get from a small oscillator a long wave-length, if the rate of damping (y) be fixed,
or, if the wave-length be fixed, we require very rapid damping. Neither of these
conditions seem easy of physical realisation. Still something might be done by way
of striking a balance, and, at any rate, we must not disregard the fact that a con-
siderable portion of Herrz’s experiments were made inside that portion of the field
where the influence of these singular points and of the damping should at least
theoretically make themselves felt.

(14.) Conclusions—We may draw the following general conclusions :—

(i.) The effect of damping makes itself very sensible in modifying the form of the
wave-surface as propagated into space from a theoretical oscillator. The typical
Hertzian wave-diagrams require to be replaced by the fuller series accompanying this
memoir.

(ii.) Three waves of electro-magnetic force may be considered as sent out from the
