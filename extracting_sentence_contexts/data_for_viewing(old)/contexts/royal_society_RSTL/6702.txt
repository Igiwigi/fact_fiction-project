With the transparent elementary gases it is impossible to measnre directly the absorp-
tion of 0:1 of an inch; but assuming, as before, that up to an absorption of 1 the effect
is proportional to the quantity of gas present, the absorption of each of the elementary
gases, at a tension of 0-1 of an inch, would be about 00033; hence the absorption of
boracic ether of 0:1 of an inch tension is to that of air at the same tension as

620 : 00033,
which would give to the ether an energy 186,000 times that of air.

I have already spoken of the blackness of ammonia at 30 inches tension. Referring
to Table I., its absorption is found to be 1195. In the last Table the vapour of acetic
ether, possessing only one-thirtieth of the tension of the ammonia, produces apparently
the same effect; its absorption is also 1195. Such facts give one entirely new ideas
of the capabilities of matter, and our wonder will not be diminished by the results to be
recorded further on.

With both gases and vapours we find that it does not follow that a gas which produces
a larger effect than another at one tension should surpass that other at all tensions.
Some gases start from a lower level than others, but finally attain an equa), or even a
greater elevation. If their absorptions were represented by, curyes plotted from the
same datum-line, these curves would in some cases approach, and in s0me Cases Cross
each other. At a tension of 1 inch, for example, carbonic acid has more than double
the absorptive power of carbonic oxide, whereas at a tension of 30 inches they are
equal; indeed some of my experiments show carbonic oxide to have the advantage. On
the 22nd of October, for example, I found the deflection produced by 2 inches of car-
