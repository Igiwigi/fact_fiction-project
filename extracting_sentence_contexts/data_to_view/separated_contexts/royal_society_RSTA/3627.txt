The three main stakeholder groups of figure 3, expanded into layers of increasing size, and with illustrative
relationships among them, each of which could be influenced by either party. (Online version in colour.)

determines the flow of money, energy and materials in the economy. Each occurs in a context
of increasing scale and influence, but with slower rates of change. The figure illustrates the
fact that at every level of scale, each grouping within any one of the three stakeholders has
some relationship with each level of the other two. A simple answer to the question ‘who can
do what to whom’ is therefore that either party in every one of the relationships in figure 13
could choose to act to influence the other towards reducing material demand. For example,
communities developing a shared sense of values about material consumption could act as a
lobby to influence national and international policy processes or, in reverse, policy could influence
the choices open to the community.
