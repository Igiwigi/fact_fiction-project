to the usually accepted biological criteria, the characters of the ancestral type among
the Termitidse are exhibited, in their least modified form, in the winged males and
females. â€˜The soldiers betray obvious specialisations on the one hand, and indications
of degeneration on the other. For this reason it is probable that the primitive
Termites consisted solely of winged males and females, and exhibited at first no
manifestations of a communal life. The prototype of the worker can be explained as
having arisen as a mutation of the nymph stage, and characterised by the absence of
wing rudiments, and the possession of a markedly larger head and jaws than those of
the race from which it sprang, Natural selection would then come into play and
favour the increased development of useful characters, and the degeneration of
certain others, along lines already suggested by WrIsMANN (loc. cit.). It is probable
that the soldier caste similarly arose by a further mutation or series of mutations.
The fact that transitional forms, intermediate in character between the soldier,
worker, and winged castes, are practically unknown argues in favour of these
mutations being inherited according to the laws of Mendelian segregation. I hope
to show in this essay that such an interpretation appears to offer a more consistent
explanation of the varied phenomena associated with Termite polymorphism than any
hypothesis hitherto put forward.

The presence of worker-like individuals in Archotermopsis has a direct bianiny upon
the origin of the worker castes among Termites. Eleven examples of these forms
were dissected, and they were found to closely resemble the nymphs in most of their
anatomical characters. The chief difference was to be observed in the gonads, which
are larger in size, probably owing to the fact that the worker-like forms are nearer
sexual maturity. Many of the ova are also in a more advanced stage in develop-
