I may add, that without accurate calculation
E it is generally possible to tell which body has to bear the greatest strain, by simply ob-
5 8erving at which end the excess of weight is greater. For example, in the * Victoria and
Albert” the excess of weight over buoyancy is greater at the bow than at the stern, and
the section of absolute maximum bending-strain falls in the fore body ; had the reverse
been true, the section would have fallen in the after body, as it does in the cases of the
© Bellerophon” and © Audacious.” Professor RaxKIxE, while recognizing the existence of
these sections of maximum hogging-moment, does not seem to have noticed the fact that
the strains at them would generally be more severe than those at the section of maximum

8agging-moment. With respect to the actual amounts of the bending-moments experienced by the typical

ships I have chosen, when floating in still water, but few remarks are necessary, since
these moments are much less 8evere than those experienced by the same ships when at
sea, or when placed in exceptional positions ashore.
