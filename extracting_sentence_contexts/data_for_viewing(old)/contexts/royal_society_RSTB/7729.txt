Conclusions. It will be as well to recapitulate the tentative conclusions now reached
concerning the complex matter of wind and migratory behaviour, with special reference to
the optomotor theory and the hypothesis elaborated from it. The conclusions will be given
under the headings of taking-off and settling, speed of flight, height of flight, and direction
of flight, but these aspects of behaviour are in practice integrated, in such a way as to create
a strong presumption that migrant locusts have both a preferred retinal velocity and
a preferred air speed.

Taking-off and settling. Strong wind has a suppressive effect on taking-off and on flight
near the ground, but less effect on flight well above the ground. Fliers near the ground are
caused to settle by gusts, while taking-off occurs in lulls, so that gusty winds may
produce a resultant down-wind movement. These facts are consistent with the optomotor
theory.

Speed of flight. The cruising air speed of Schistocerca is in the region of 3 m./sec., but when
flying close to the ground against a wind of varying speed the locusts seem to stabilize their
ground speed by varying their air speed which may then reach 5 m./sec. or more for short
periods at least. Farther away from the ground, air speed seems less influenced by wind
speed, and at sufficient height is presumed to be entirely uninfluenced, unless temporarily
in very turbulent air. These conclusions are also consistent with the optomotor theory, but
there is an urgent need for further measurements of air speeds in known conditions.

Height of flight, among low-fliers, depends on the wind speed in much the same way as
taking-off and settling; locusts ascend somewhat in lulls and descend in gusts. This accords
