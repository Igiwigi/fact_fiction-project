therefore, that hydrolysed dehydrated “ A” is a substance having the same empirical
formula as Substance “ A,” but containing three carboxyl groups and on heating above
100° C, it reverts by loss of 1 mol. of water to dehydrated “ A.”

The presence of solvent of crystallisation, as indicated by the difference between the
total loss in weight on heating (0-0379 gm.) and the gain in weight of the CaCl, tubes
(0-0264 gm.), together with the extreme instability of hydrolysed dehydrated “ A 4

even at room temperature, have rendered it impossible to obtain satisfactory combustion
results. The instability of the material is indicated by the fact that, while a freshly
prepared sample has a melting point of 87° C., this had fallen to 82° C. after standing
for three days at room temperature and to 42°-43° C. after standing for three weeks at
the same temperature.

ALKYLATION Propucts.

It was hoped by studying the alkylation products of Substance “ A” and hydrolysed
Substance “ A” to obtain confirmation of the observation already made (see p. 313)
that hydrolysed “A” contains one hydroxyl group. The alkylation products were,
however, disappointing, and it was found impossible to alkylate the hydroxyl group
by any method tried, although the three carboxyl groups were relatively easily
esterified. Further, all the products obtained were oily liquids which refused to
