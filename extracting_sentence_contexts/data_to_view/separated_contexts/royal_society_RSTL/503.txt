To ascertain this point, the fol-
lowing experiment was made :

6 Mr. Home's Lecture

The posterior half of a cat's eye, while in a very recent state,
was immersed in a bason of water, and examined, "The tapetum
appeared very bright, the retina not having acquired sufficient
opacity to become visible : the-entrance of the optic nerve was
a very white spot, which seemed to be opaque; but, when
small pieces of coloured paper were alternately placed between
the outside of the eye and the bottom of the bason, their colour
was distinctly seen in the cavity of the eye, through the sub-
stance of the optic nerve; so that, at this part, the internal
structure of the nerve has a degree of transparency. This appeared to be a newly-discovered fact; and, to ascer-
tain whether it was really s0, the works of several physiologi-
cal writers were consulted, but nothing was found which gave
an idea that their authors had the smallest knowledge of it. This semi-transparent state of-the internal parts of the optic
nerve, while recent, led naturally to the examination of its
substance, by means of magnifying glasses; and, notwithstand-
ing the failure of s0 many men of superior abilities, in this in-
tricate inquiry, it held out the hope of meeting with some guc-
cesS.

The principal theories which have been formed respecting
the structure of nerves, have been taken notice of by FoxTana :
as they all differ from the observations which will be stated in
the present Paper, it may not be improper to mention the
heads of each of them, s0 as to bring into one point of view, all
the knowledge that has been acquired on the subject. Tor: found the medullary substance of the brain, spinal
marrow, and nerves, to be a mass' of transparent globules,
swimming in a transparent fluid.
