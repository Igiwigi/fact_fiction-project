Ranunculus acrs,
Centaurea nigra, Veronica Chamedrys, and Cerastium triviale, though in smaller
amounts, alsÂ» showed tendency to increase. Conopodium denudatum, on the other
hand, gradually diminished. The tendency of change under the influence of the
decreasing available residue of the dung was, in fact, to decrease the unusual promin-
ence of Rumer, and to bring a larger number of species into position in the struggle. Comparing the actual yield of the different groups and species of plants on plot 2
with their amounts without manure, ib is seen that in the firs separation-year there
5 was a very considerable excess of total Graminew, a deficiency of total Leguminos,
and a large excess of total Miscellanee, under the influence of the dung. Among the
grasses, Poa trivialis and Bromus mollis were in very large excess.
