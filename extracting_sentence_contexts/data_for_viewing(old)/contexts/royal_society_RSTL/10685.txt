greensand varies from a light pellucid to a dark brown tinb ; it is readily translucent;
in thin sections. Tt is highly brittle, and sufficiently hard to geratch glass. Tt shows
no reaction in nitric acid, and may thus be assumed to be free from calcite. Thin
microscopic sections exhibit a nearly transparent ground-mass of chalzedonie—some-
times partially also of erystalline—silica, in which are numerous sponge-spicules, and
also occasionally entire and fragmentary foraminifera and fragments of echinoderm
structure. In some cases also grains of quartz-sand and glauconite are present. The
chalcedoniec silica forming the ground-mass can be seen in many cases to have been
deposited in concentric layers over the enclosed siliceous and calcareous organie
remains; it also, when partially crystalline, exhibits a radiate fibrous structure
(Plate 40, fig. 3).

Throughout the chert, sponge-spicules are present, but owing to the fact that, the
spicules are usually of chalcedony, like the ground-mass of the chert in which they
are enclosed, their outlines are very indistinct. But even when the spicules them-
selves cannot for this reason be recognised, their former presence 1s indicated by the
s0lidified canals, which being of glauconite, or of silica of a different tint to that of
the matrix, are distinctly shown (Plate 40, fig. 3.). In some cases the spicules have
been dissolved after the chert has formed round them, leaving empty moulds.

Intimately allied to the chert is the yellowish-gray porous rock which frequently
forms an exterior crusb to the chert, but sometimes also forms independent beds.
The rock is principally of chalcedonic silica, with which very frequently calcite is
intermingled. The main difference between this rock and chert consists in its porous
nature, arising from the fact that the spicules in it are but as empty casts, and the
