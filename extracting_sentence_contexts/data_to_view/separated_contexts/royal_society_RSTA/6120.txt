For instance, the visible
universe today—our own bubble—comprised a huge number of causally disconnected regions
at Planck time (and also at the time of inflation). But during inflation one of these regions was
inflated to encompass all others, allowing thus a restored type of causal communication between
them and leading to today’s observed uniformity. In fact, it is a most important property of the resulting inflationary picture of the early universe,
also improved and generalized by various later modifications or extensions, that by the same
mechanism it also explains other additional properties: the temperature and energy-density
fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background radiation as a result of the quantum phase
during the inflationary stage, namely, the quantum fluctuations of the scalar field driving inflation
(see [5] for background in the theory of cosmological fluctuations, [6] for an early review of the
inflationary approach to this problem, [7] for the situation in the early 1990s and [8] for a modern
review of this idea). Today the development of the inflationary picture of the early universe continues. There
are practically hundreds of model-dependent implementations of inflation in different theories,
for instance in relativity, modified gravity, supergravity, superstring cosmology, M-theoretic
cosmology, etc., but there are two issues of importance related to the inflationary scenario that
require attention, and which show that inflation is certainly not the last word about the structure
of the early universe.
