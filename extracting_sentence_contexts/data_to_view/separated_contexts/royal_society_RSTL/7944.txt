The reciprocal of the first of these is
o=a—n+#—Y —3x—20'—4B'—3';
viz. writing a=n(n—1)—2b—3c, and z=3n(n—2)—6b—8c, this is
o=dn(n—2)—8b—11c—2j —3x —2C'—4B'—3s';

and it thus appears that the order o' of the spinode curve is reduced by 3 for each off-

4. As to the other two equations, writing for g, their values, these become

J+6t+8i+58 +67 =d(2n—4)—29,
2x+3u+4i+188+5y=ec(bn—12)—6r+30,

equations which admit of a geometrical interpretation. In fact, when there is only a
nodal curve, the first equation is

J+6t=b(2—4)— 2g,

which we may verify when the nodal curve is a complete intersection, P=0, Q=0 ; for
if the equation of the surface is (A, B, CFP, Q)*=0, where the degrees of A, B, C, P.Q
are n—2f, n—f—g, n—29, f, g respectively, then the pinch-points are given by the
equations P=0, Q=0, AC—B*=0, and the number j of pinch-points is thus

=fg(2m—2f—2g)=(2Mm—A4fg—2Yu(F+9—2);
but for the curve P=0, Q=0 we have #=0, and its order and class are 6=fq.
a=f9(f+9—2), or the formula is thus verified. Similarly, when there is only a cuspidal curve, the second equation is

2x+39=c(5n—12)—6r+39,

which may be verified when the cuspidal curve is a complete intersection, P=0, Q=0;
the equation of the surface is here (A, B, OYP, QY=0, where AC—B*=MP+NQ,
and the points x, @ are given as the intersections of the curve with the surtace
(A, B, CYN, —M)*=0. Now AC—B? yanishing for P=0, Q=0 we must have A=4As?+A', B=AuS+B'.
