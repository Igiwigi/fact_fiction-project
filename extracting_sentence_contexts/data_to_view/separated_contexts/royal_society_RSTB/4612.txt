Geol. Soc. Amer.,’ 28, December, 1917, p. 984:—‘‘ The mode of origin
of the mammalian vomer is much more like that of the reptilian parasphenoid than that of the reptilian
vomer.” Also Watson, 34, p. 365, No. 39 :—‘“ The vomer of Ornithorhynchus has a very similar position
to the rostral part of the parasphenoid of reptiles”; and (p. 385) :—‘“ These facts seem to me to establish
a case, too strong to be lightly set aside, for the homology of the os paradoxum [of Ornithorhynchus] with
the reptilian prevomers, and of the mammalian vomer with the rostral part of the parasphenoid of
reptiles ;” and (p. 360):—* In the ‘ Therocephalian’ Lycosaurus there is a large parasphenoid appearing
on the palate in the exact region oceupied by the mammalian vomer of Cynognathids ;” and (p. 360) :—
“The whole of this evidence taken together seems to me to support Broom’s view of the homology
of the mammalian vomer, although it is not yet quite conclusive.”
