According to this view the anterior limit of the primitive knot of the gastrular
stage should correspond approximately, in its position in the blastoderm, with the
anterior limit of the archenteric plate in the postgastrular stage. In any case we are bound to admit that the “primitive” or “ archenteric ” knot
of the earlier stage is morphologically equivalent to much more than that posterior
intact portion of the archenteron in the later (postgastrular) stage, to which we
have quite frequently applied the like designation of “ primitive knot.” The latter
is identical with ‘ HensEn’s knot,” and not this only, but the whole of the lengthy
“archenteric plate” (head-process) as well, are to be regarded as the derivatives of
the original “ primitive knot” of the gastrular stage. The facts set forth in the paper seem to indicate that the differentiation of the
archenteric plate proceeds from before backwards, and that therefore the oldest part
of the plate is its anterior extremity.*

It is true that, in the instances above cited, the distance in Specimen Q, measured
from the fore end of the knot to the hinder end of the primitive streak, falls short,
by approximately 2 millims., of the full extent of the axial differentiation in the
subsequent postgastrular stage as represented by Specimen P. But it must be
borne in mind that, during the transition from the earlier to the later stage, the
dimensions of the blastodermic vesicle have increased from about 9 or 10 to about
12°5 millims. in diameter. It is therefore reasonable to suppose that interstitial
growth would in large degree affect the longitudinal extent of the area in question.
