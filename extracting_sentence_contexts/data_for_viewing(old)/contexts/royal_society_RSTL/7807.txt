scope was now again brought into operation on the minute image horizontally.

Result —Exquisite picture brilliantly lit up ; even the foliage glittering in the s8un-
light was sharp, clear, and decisive, s0 that the details of the garden picture were mar-
vellously displayed.

The difference appeared truly surprising as regards the two methods of obtaining the
same magnifying-power, especially the increased light with diminished aperture.

In both these cases the greatest pains were taken to properly adjust the index collars
of the objectives for the finest possible definition of an uncoyered object.

A new fact had appeared highly suggestive of further inquiry. Accordingly, distribu-
tion of power was now varied by employing differently constructed eye-lenses, especially
© crossed lenses” *, and inserting, midway between the objective and eyepiece, conver lenses
of great variety. It was now seen that these lenses, intermediately placed, developed
an entirely new aberration of a negative kind. Tt became important to decide

* Crossed lenses, well known to give a minimum aberration having the radii of their curved surfaces
as 6:1,

+ It is convenient to define the aberration to be positive or negative, or the lens to be over- or undereorrected,
by the simple fact that a conyex lens causes the excentrical rays to cross the axis at a point nearer the
centre of the lens than the centrical rays, in which case, and in all analogous cases, it may he said that the
lens is undercorrected and afflicted with a negative aberration. English objectives are now constructed on
