The duct cell of the labral gland may be taken as corresponding to the proximal
duct cell of the antennal gland. The two gland cells would then correspond to the
two distal duct cells of the antennal gland. Such a comparison is supported by the
fact that fluid of some sort does accumulate between the two distal duct cells, just as
the secretion of the labral gland accumulates in a reservoir between its two gland cells. Further, the cytoplasm of the labral gland cells is filled with dark-staining rodlike
bodies, just as are the distal duct cells of the antennal gland, although in the former
case they are not arranged in any special manner as they are in the latter. If it is allowed that this morphological similarity may have some homological
significance, it appears to the writer possible to suggest a rational explanation of the
two distinct types of excretory glands that occur in Estheria and in Crustacea generally.
