either as the unsaturated residues of dehydrogenation}, or more likely as molecules
nearly dissociated which at that moment are attacked by oxygen giving a complex
> (temporary peroxide) which immediately provides an aldehyde and water. The
@ aldehyde is presumably active and goes through a series of reactionst propagating
= the chain, and presumably one of the chain carriers, R — C = O, or whatever it
may be, activates a further hydrocarbon molecule. As pointed out before, the
process is autocatalytic.§

Owing to the marked effect of inhibitors on the aldehyde oxidation, one would
expect firstly that this would be the stage at which the chain would be broken, and
ES secondly that the knock would be due to a product (such as peroxide) of this part
of the combustion process. But this has yet to be reconciled with the facts which
’ have been set out in this discussion and with the further facts, that hydrocarbons
such as heptene (or even alcohols), although they give rise to aldehydes, do not
readily knock, and that the concentration of aldehydes at t.d.c. for hexane which
knocks and cyclohexane which does not knock were found to be very much the
same. Perhaps this may be due to a difference in the activity of the aldehyde
molecules which have to propagate the chain, but it is possible that the “ knock ” may
be due to disruption of a peroxide of the ethyl hydrogen type stabilized from the
earliest stage of combustion and which can, like the aldehyde products, be destroyed
by “ anti-knocks,” and in that case it is likely enough to be that which has been found.
