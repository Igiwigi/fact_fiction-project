As the RCPs do not impose
a single set point, activity patterns are not unlearned when
a certain input is kept active (inactive) for extended periods
of time (compare figure 5d with 5¢,h). As a result, neuron 2 shown in figure 5h shows ‘no learn-
ing’ which seems undesirable at first. However, it is in fact
useful for such a stable equilibrium to exist when learning
is considered as a network phenomenon. Other neurons
(neuron 1 in our case) already are selective and code for a
given stimulus. Analogously, neuron 2 might in fact code
for a different stimulus which is not active at the moment,
in which case we would like to perturb it as little as possible
while other neurons ‘learn’ (figure 5/).
