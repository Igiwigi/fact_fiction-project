By a trigonometrical calculation, I have ascertained that the
sun rose centrally eclipsed to the inhabitants of Great Buc-
charia in N. lat, 4o* 17', and E. long. 61* gz: and the moon's
umbra then proceeded in a south-easterly direction across
Thibet and China. Consequently this eclipse (which, more-
over, was an annular one) could not possibly be central in any
part of Asia lying to the west of the Caspian Sea: and M.
VorLNey ought to have taken some 5teps towards ascertaining
this fact, before he ventured to set up his own opinion in op-
position to all preceding chronologists.

I have thus shown, from the most correct evidence which
the present state of astronomical science affords, that not one
of the eclipses, mentioned by either of the authors above al-
luded to, could possibly be that which is recorded in s0 singular
a manner by HreropoTvs. In order, however, that I might
not leave the subject in the same degree of doubt in which I
found it, I have taken the pains to calculate all the solar eclipses
that were likely to have been visible in Asia Minor, from the
year 6zo B. C. to 580 B. C.: but, out of this period of seventy
years, I have found only one that was central in, or near, any
