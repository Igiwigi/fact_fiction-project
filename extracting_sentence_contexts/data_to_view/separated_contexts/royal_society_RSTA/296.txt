At the second RSDM on
H}, Oka cautiously noted that it seemed like the results from ion storage ring
experiments and theoretical calculations were converging [30]. In the proceedings of the Chicago meeting, one can note some optimism in the
contribution by Larsson et al. [22], who are even (concerning preliminary results
rom June 2001) talking about ‘... a breakthrough in the experimental study
of the DR [dissociative recombination] Hj...’ (p. 90). In fact, the CRYRING
eam was on the wrong track and it was not until it joined forces with the
Saykally group at UC Berkeley that the breakthrough would emerge [31-33]. A supersonic expansion ion source was built and characterized at Berkeley,
shipped to Stockholm and CRYRING for preliminary tests, shipped back to
Berkeley for modifications and finally shipped back to Stockholm for experiments. The characterization of the rotational temperature of the Hy ions extracted
‘rom the ion source by means of cavity-ring-down spectroscopy showed that the
ions were rotationally cold.
