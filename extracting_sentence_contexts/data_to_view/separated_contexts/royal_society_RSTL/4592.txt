Hence it may be remoyed from within the brackets and the equation

as the symbol © and the function © are both independent of the variable v. And this
would in fact be the best form if we could effect generally the integration in the second
member. For the applications to which we shall proceed (3.), is, however, the form to
be preferred. We may express the results which have been arrived at in the following general
theorem.
