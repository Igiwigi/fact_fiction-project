Norton Sound the dissipation is probably small, for it is mostly north of St. Lawrence
Island, and the tide is diurnal. The Gulf of Anadir probably contributes about as
much as Bristol Bay; for though its area is twice as great, its more northerly
situation must reduce the current somewhat. In all, then, the average rate of
dissipation in Bering Sea is about 1°5x 10" ergs per second. ‘This estimate is of
course subject to considerable error, for it depends wholly on a few observations,
which may not give quite a fair sample of the whole of the sea. The depths around
the localities considered are fairly typical of the sea as a whole, so that great error on
this ground is not to be anticipated; but errors in observing the velocities may be
greater, and both kinds of error are magnified in importance by the fact that the
velocity must be cubed when the dissipation is caleulated, so that if the true mean
velocity were only 2 knots instead of 25 knots the dissipation would be almost halved.
It does not appear that the velocity increases much towards the coast ; in fact the

velocities near the Alaskan coast seem to be rather smaller than those near the
islands. Thus an underestimate on this ground is not probable.
