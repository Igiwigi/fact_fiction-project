Indeed, in the theory of the transition temperature
for phase transitions, the finite rigidity and existence of phonons that distort the polyhedra is
seen to be the key factor: the transition temperature is found to be proportional to the stiffness
[24]. What the RUM picture is doing is identifying some fixed points in reciprocal space where
there is an inherent flexibility of the network as the origin of the low-energy dynamics, thereby
helping us to understand phenomena like phase transitions, NTE, and cage flexing in porous
structures. Having remarked that the bending force constants are likely to be somewhat lower than the
bond-stretching force constants, we immediately realize that there is in fact a spectrum of values
across the range of materials, assuming that the bonds themselves are quite rigid. We will explore
this point next.

(b) Actual rigidity in ceramic network structures

It is easy to take the impression that the polyhedra in any network structure are rigid, but actually
that is not necessarily so. It is certainly the case that in SiO we can argue that the force constants
for deformations of the tetrahedra are much stronger than all other force constants in the structure.
