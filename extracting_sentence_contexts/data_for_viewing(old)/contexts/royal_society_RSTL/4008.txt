the muscular current is in the muscle endued with a certain degree of vitality. The
experiments referred to, making the pile act in vacuum, in hydrogen, in oxygen,
and in carbonic acid, prove with full evidence that it is not the action of the gas
upon the inner surface of the muscle which occasions the current. To remove
all possible doubt, I have taken the precaution of preparing the half thighs of frogs
with gilded scissors or with pieces of glass made sharp at the edges ; the mus-
cular current was the same, as in fact it ought to have been, as indeed it should have
been.

It might be said, reasoning according to a theory the value of which is well-appre-
ciated at the present day, that the cause of the muscular current resides in the con-
tact between the inner and the outer part of the muscle, or in other words, of two
heterogeneous bodies. Let this then be the simplest interpretation of all the facts
discovered by myself ; it is 8ufficient for me to have well-established that this contact
of heterogeneous parts of the muscle generates electricity in the conditions discovered,
and such as they are described in the results referred to above.

With regard to my own opinion, it appears more satisfactory to say that the deve-
lopment of electricity takes place in the muscle during life from the chemical action
between the arterial blood and the muscular fibre ; that the two electric states eyolved
in the muscle neutralize each other, at the same points from which they are evolved,
in the natural conditions of the musele ; and that in the muscular pile imagined by
myself, a portion of this electricity is put in circulation just as it would be in a pile
composed of acid and alkali, separated from each other by a simply conducting body.
