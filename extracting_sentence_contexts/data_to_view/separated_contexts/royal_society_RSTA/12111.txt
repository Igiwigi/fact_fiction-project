Watching the beams of a revolving lighthouse, tracking their way to a dista
and brandished rapidly round, it is not at once quite evident whether the shape
those beams is not a spiral of enormous pitch (see below). We see, however, thi
on the corpuscular view the paths will be straight, though hot radiating from
precise centre; for instance, the rays from the Sun, whose peripheral velocity
nearly 5000 miles an hour, would if regarded as projectiles, be inclined to their ra
at an angle of sws2ssee radian, or about 14 seconds of are; and the Sun’s cen’
would be, apparently displaced through a fraction of this angle, equal to Sun
radius/Sun’s distance ; 7.e., through about the ;}oth part of a second.

11. But now, proceeding to look at the matter from the point of view of way
there are many differences; principally depending on the fact that there is no qu
tion of initial velocity of projection about a wave: it crawls through the mediu

* As these projectile examples are only used for illustration, I simplify matters artificially
omitting all curvatures of path. The subject of aberration in general is illustrated more fully
