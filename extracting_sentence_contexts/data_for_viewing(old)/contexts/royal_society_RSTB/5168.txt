recorded as intrusive into the Rhetic. The general list resembles that of the rocks
which we refer to the Minchia Series, but if M. Leaenprnâ€™s field evidence be correct
the rhyolite cannot be earlier than Jurassic.

As the well-established Devonian sequence in eastern Yunnan includes no evidence
of igneous activity, the reference to the Minchia Series of a very varied series of igneous
rocks may suggest doubt as to its age. The porphyry, spilite, and rhyolite clearly
belong to the Minchia Series, for they are associated from Li-kiang to A-tun-tze. The
granites are intrusive into the older grits, but we could not at first find clear evidence
of their intrusion into the Minchia Series ; it was possible that they might be pre-Minchia
in age, and the metamorphism of the Minchia beds might be due to the porphyries ;
but later field evidence left no doubt that the granites are intrusive into the Minchia
Series. This fact does not, however, prove the post-Minchia age of the igneous rocks ;

for the volcanic rocks of the upper part of the Minchia Series, including the trachyte
tufts and trachytes of A-tun-tze and Li-kiang, are doubtless superficial representatives
of the granodiorites and porphyries.

The Minchia igneous series is predominantly sub-acid, whereas the Carboniferous
igneous rocks are basic. The absence of the Minchia type in 8.E. Yunnan is an indica-
tion that during the volcanic activity in N.W. Yunnan the 8.E. part of the province
was covered by the sea and undergoing quiet sedimentation.
