could be seen in these forms was noticed in specimen F. This is the second specimen
that was described in 1933 when the presence of seven teeth in the left side was
noted and the suggestion made that the extra tooth was actually the fourth.
Comparison cf the two sides shows that the anterior three teeth are almost identical
with their fellows in the opposite side, as are the last three. The distance occupied

is the same in both maxillae but in the right side there is a very marked gap in the
middle of the series. The interpretation now suggested is that the real fourth tooth
is missing from the right side, and that the true seventh is present in both maxillae.
This is strongly supported by the fact that in every specimen examined—including
a large number in various museums in South Africa—the fifth tooth is always
relatively large, as in the left side, and is not of the small size of the actual fifth in the
right maxilla. A similar condition may have been present in specimen A. Here
the right maxilla is separate and has been cleaned in palatal view. The tip of the
replacing canine, visible in its socket, and the root of the second post-canine tooth
are all that is preserved, but it is seen that the alveoli of the three anterior post-canine
teeth are confluent as are the last three, while the two series are separated by a
distinct bridge of bone, fig. 5A. The left maxilla has the second, third and fifth
teeth in place but there is no indication of a similar gap between the third tooth and
the alveolus of the fourth. It is not possible to say whether or not a seventh tooth
was present in this side. The explanation of the absence of the true fourth tooth
in specimen F is not at all clear, but it is important to recognize that the teeth which
