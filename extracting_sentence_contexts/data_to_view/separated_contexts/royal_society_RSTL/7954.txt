there are here 10 composite covyariants, but only 5 irreducible coyariants ; there should
therefore be 10—5, =5 syzygies; we have in fact the 6 derived syzygies

designated by 6E'; these must therefore be connected by 1 identical relation (desig-
nated by o), viz. this is the equation 0=0 obtained by adding the several syzygies,
each multiplied by the proper numerical factor as shown Table No. 89. 345.
