The phloem-groups are evidently placed between the angles of the xylem, so that the
structure is typically that of a root. The thin-walled, tabular cells of the phellogen
lie so close to the phloem as to leave no doubt that the periderm arose in deep-seated
tissue, and probably in the pericycle. Direct proof of this fact is afforded by a still smaller rootlet (with a mean diameter
of scarcely a millimetre), shown in transverse section in Plate 12, fig. 19. This rootlet
retains its primary cortex, while the formation of periderm has already begun. The
xylem, though slightly deformed, is evidently triarch, and agrees well with that of
the other specimens, but in this case no secondary growth had yet taken place.
