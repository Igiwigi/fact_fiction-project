We have established that if (c) in the convergence theorem fails to hold (but the remaining two
are satisfied), the limit lim,_,1— T;(#)x exists and is uniform for f in compact subsets of R* only for
x in the subspace Xq of the original Banach space. Outside of Xo, the limit usually does not exist.

In the theory of singular perturbations it often happens, though, that the limit exists even if
x ¢ Xo; of course, this limit must then not be uniform as described above. It may be shown that in


such a case it is uniform for f in compact subsets of the open right half-axis (0,00). For singular
perturbation theorists, the reason for that is clear: there are initial (and possibly other) layers
involved here, and the convergence simply cannot be uniform around f = 0.

In fact, quite often singular perturbation theorems have the form

Jim T,(t)x =T(t)Px, t>0,xeEX, (5.1)
ro1-

where {T(t), t = 0} is a strongly continuous semigroup on a subspace Xq of X and P is a projection
onto Xo (in the sense that P* = P and Px = x,x € Xo). To repeat, in this case, the classical theory
does not work and, in particular, condition

lim (A—A,)-1x=(4-B)-!Px, = xeX, (5.2)
rol

(where B is the generator of {T(f), t > 0}) for all (some) 4 > 0 is necessary but not sufficient for (5.1).
