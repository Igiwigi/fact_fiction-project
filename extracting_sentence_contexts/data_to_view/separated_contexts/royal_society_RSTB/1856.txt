Butside this osteodentine comes a layer about 3 millims. in thickness which is
Blourless, of glassy transparency, and which has a higher refractive index than the
Hjacent dentine (Plate 17, fig. 1). = This difference in colour, which is of very frequent occurrence in fossil teeth, as well
a the great transparency of the enamel layer, renders conspicuous the fact that the line
£f junction between the two tissues is not straight, but that extensions of the brown

entine matrix run out for some distance into the enamel, becoming smaller as they
o, and also less defined, until they are finally lost sight of after having traversed
Peahothing less than one-third of the thickness of the enamel. § In each of these processes of dentine matrix one, two, or more dentinal tubes may

traced. & These have had their origin from some of the larger canals of the osteodentine, and
they do not cease with the fading out of the brown matrix, but run on through the
whole thickness of the enamel.
