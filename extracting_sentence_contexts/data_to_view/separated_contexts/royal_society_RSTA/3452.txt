Better observational constraints on winds before the
1960s will help to yield more robust simulations of oxygen changes during the 50 years between
1960 and 2010. Information contained, for example, in ship logbooks, re-analyses combining
historical pressure data and dynamical models, and proxy information may all help to improve
the historical wind products. The fact that current models do not seem to be able to reproduce
the patterns of thermocline oxygen changes that have been identified by decades of high-quality
oxygen observations is a scientific challenge that has to be resolved in order to raise confidence
in our modelsâ€™ reliability when it comes to simulating the response, and possible feedbacks, of
biogeochemical cycles to expected future environmental change. Data accessibility. CMIP5 model data have been obtained from the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) CMIP5 as)

repository (e.g. http://cmip-pemdi-lInl.gov /cmip5/data_portal.html) and have been accessed in February =
