They are
willing to bet that each year the past 30-year mean will exceed the previous one. They note that
those who believe there is no basis for the ongoing warming ought to take up the bet, and that
those who reject greenhouse climate change presumably must believe that global temperatures
must soon stabilize or fall. The fact that so few bets have actually been taken against greenhouse
warming implies that the level of actual resistance to greenhouse theory by climate contrarians is
not as strong as claimed. The analysis of betting strategies here shows that contrarians are rational
insofar as they are not betting against greenhouse warming.

2. Climate variability across temporal scales

Any bet on temperature changes over the next decade and a half will depend on natural variations
on this time scale as well as any greenhouse forced response on this time scale.
