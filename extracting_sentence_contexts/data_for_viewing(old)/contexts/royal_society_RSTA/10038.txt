Physik, 1902, p. 745) that for a glass containing between 60 and 70 per cent. of
EbO the stress-optical coefficient changes sign, and an experiment made by him with
such a glass pointed to the fact that the stress-optical coefficient did not vanish
multaneously for all colours, a result which has been independently confirmed by
e present author from considerations of curves showing C and AC/AX plotted to
ercentage of lead (see ‘Camb. Phil. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. XXI., p. 335). Now if the law
AY = C,/(1—)/A) held universally, the vanishing of C, would imply the vanishing of C
for every wave-length.
Moreover, it seems impossible to find theoretical justification for such a formula.
It is well known (see Drunpe's ‘ Theory of Optics,’ cap. V., pp. 388, 389)* that the
index of refraction p is given by the formula p*? = 1+3A,/{1—(A,/d)*}, where
A, = wave-length in vacuo of light belonging to one of the natural periods of the glass.
