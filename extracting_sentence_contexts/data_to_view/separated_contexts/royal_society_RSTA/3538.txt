direct proof in the unburnt gases
left on cooling. t

Liverne and Dewar} showed in 1884 that the flame of an explosion of gases in a

_ glass vessel exhibited with marked brightness the lines of sodium and of calcium. When the explosion ot electrolytic gas was made to pass along an iron tube about
3 feet long, closed at one end by a plate of quartz, a spectroscope placed in a line
with the axis of the tube revealed the fact that the light was largely due to iron
lines. When metallic salts in the form of powder were introduced into the explosion
tube, the corresponding lines were visible in the spectroscope. These experiments
showed how quickly the ignited gases could detach and volatilise solid matter from
the side of the tube.
