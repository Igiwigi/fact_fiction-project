The X group of lines in the solar spectrum and that of the groups already mentioned
appears to one of us to remain of constant intensity ab any elevation of the sun or in
any state of the intermediate atmosphere. It may therefore be necessary to refer them
to s8ome absorbing medium lying at the wn itself, or beyond the usually accepted
limits of our atmosphere. Be it where it may, the fact remains that, in 6wo instances
at least, a 8tudy of the absorption spectra of organic bodies has to some extent thrown
a glimmering of meaning on some of the absorption lines of the solar spectrum,

The value of a study of the absorption spectra of liquids (not including in this term
solids in solution) in order to gain an insight into their molecular constitution has
been demonstrated by Professors HARTLEY and HUNTINGDON, and by their organized
attack they have thrown much light on the subject ; but we venture to think that
the results we have obtained will prove that in these absorptions a still greater insight
into the molecular constitutions of such bodies may be given. We may be too sanguine,
but we believe not. Tt seems to us that the spectra leave as definite characters to
read as are to be found in hieroglyphics, and we venture to think that we have given
a clue to enable them to be deciphered.
