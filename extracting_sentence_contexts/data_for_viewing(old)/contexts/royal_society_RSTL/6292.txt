the argument of artificial make is the strongest. Even if some natural cause did tend to
produce deceptive forms, it would be, as before mentioned, according to some one given
simple type, such as the flint knives or single flakes; but in these implements we find
three principal typesf,—one, lance-shaped (fig. 8); a second, almond-shaped (fig. 5);
and a third smaller form, a flattened ovoid (fig. 1), (Plate XII. to XIV.). In length they
vary from 2 to 11 inches, a medium size being the most general. These forms are con-
stant, and each type presents a nearly constant relation between the length and breadth
of the specimens. In A there is a sharp point, with a central, and often high, midrib
on either 8ide; in B we find a rounded cutting end, the sides flatter, and the midrib is
less marked. In both forms one end is generally large and blunt, and the side-edges
sharp; and advantage is taken, at the blunt end, of the original outer surface and form

+ Or as the gun-flint makers obserye, © flint has no grain,” Tt has not in fact the slightest cleavage.

+ Where they have undergone wear in the gravel, they, like the ordinary flints, have their edges blunted
and ars irregularly broken, and they are not unfrequently truncated at the point.
