_ The marvellously subdivided structure of the wood finds full explanation in the
existence of a stressed liquid within it. Rupture of the sap-current never can be
complete; but each chance rupture is confined to the minute dimensions of the
tracheal element in which it is formed by the fact that the woody walls, though
freely pervious to water, are impervious to undissolved gas. The endeavour of the
tree will be to develop, so far as this circumstance alone is considered, a tissue as
â€˜minute and at the same time as porous as possible. The provision of the bordered
pits appears to be directed to this end.
