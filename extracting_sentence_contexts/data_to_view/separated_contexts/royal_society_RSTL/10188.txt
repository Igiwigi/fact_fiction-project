The equipotential s8urfaces will probably then

be somewhat as sketched in fig. 3,* all the surfaces starting from where the acid comes
in contact with the zine, some of the highest potential passing through the acid, others

5 If this be the actual arrangement, then it is seen that the current which travels round

Sthe circuit from zine through acid to copper, is in opposition to the E.M.1. between the

Sine and acid, while the M.1. is related to the current in the ordinary way. The energy

Swill therefore pass outwards from there along the level surfaces. In fact, the medium

Sbetween the zinc and acid behaves like the medium between the plates of the condenser

Ain case No. (2), and it seems possible that the chemical action produces continually
«

fresh © electric displacement ” from acid towards zinc which yields as rapidly as it is

formed, the energy of the displacement moving out sideways.

dielectric through the presence of conductors, electrified matter, and 80 on.
