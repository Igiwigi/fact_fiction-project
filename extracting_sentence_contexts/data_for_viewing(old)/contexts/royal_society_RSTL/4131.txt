have examined the manuscript observations of that station in 1841 and 1842, which
are at the Royal Society : the observations appear to have been taken in those years
at every second hour only, consequently the diurnal variation derivable from them is
less complete than from an hourly record, but is quite sufficient to show that in
general characters it corresponds with that of St. Helena and the Cape of Good
Hope: the movement of the north end of the magnet in the months of May, June,
July and August, is to the east until 7 or 8 a.m., followed by an immediate return to
the west; and in November, December, January and February, to the west until
8 4.m., followed by an immediate return to the east : the last-named months have
also an easterly extreme about 2 p.m., which has no similar or opposite feature in
May, June, July and August.

From the facts here brought forward, it may be inferred that the line which has
been 8upposed to exist by the eminent authorities referred to in the commencement
of this paper, and which should be characterized by the absence of a diurnal variation
of the declination, will not be found upon the globe.
