In actively growing ferns the incipient vascular tissue at the apex is conspicuous in
suitably stained preparations. In many seed plants, on the other hand, such a tissue is not
easily demonstrated, if it is indeed present. In fact, the vascular system in flowering plants
is regarded by some investigators as being entirely of foliar origin. But there are some
flowering plants, e.g. Primula, where a prestelar ring can be observed close behind the
tip of the shoot; a small acropetal extrapolation of this ring would indicate the region of its
inception to be just below the meristematic cells of the tunica at the extreme summit of the
shoot.
