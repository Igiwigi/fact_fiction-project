380 Dr. Urz's new experimental researches

Square of their temperature, is totally inapplicable to mercury,
the inference relative to the thermometric mean between 92%
and 212* cannot be allowed. But let us examine, on their
own merits, the preceding arguments against Dr. Crawrorn
and Dx Lvuc's verification of the mean temperature between
that of freezing and boiling water.

The reasoning derives its sole force from the assumption,
that the capacity of water for heat, increases as its tempera-
ture is raised. There is adduced, however, no fact in the least
decisive on this main point. What analogy is there between
the entire change of form and constitution suffered by an incon-
densible liquid, on becoming an elastic vapour, and the pro-
gressive heating of the liquid itself? Or, although dilute
sulphuric acid and other liquids should increase in their
Specific caloric on being heated, which however has not been
satisfactorily demonstrated, are we to assert that water must
do 80 too? Itis a matter of surprize to me, that a philosopher
of Mr. Darrton's judgement and acuteness should have
pressed such inconclusive analogies into his service. He
knew well that water is endowed with some curious peculia-
rities, when compared with other liquids, or anomalies, as we
