or equivalently {I,}, {La}, and where material points can be associated with a three-dimensional
Lie group G. Using properties of right invariant fields, I motivate the assertion that the relevant
structures are discrete subgroups of G. (Note the analogous result in the case S =0—the only : =
discrete subgroups of R°, viewed as a Lie group with addition as group operations, are the 3
perfect lattices [16]). I summarize the procedure for a particular S and recall results which relate
symmetries of discrete subgroups D so obtained with symmetries of the ambient Lie group G. nee)

In §7, I explore the case where VS ¥ 0. To simplify matters a little, I consider the case where the :
crystal state corresponds to the prescription of just two lattice vector fields defined on a region a]
2 CR?, and I continue to require that the crystal state allows neutral deformations. Recall that, in DN
the case VS ¥ 0, the relevant Lie group is of a dimension greater than that of the number of linearly [o
independent lattice vector fields—I make a particular choice of lattice vectors such that the lattice fo
algebra has dimension 3, in fact I make a choice such that the corresponding three-dimensional ,
Lie group is isomorphic to a group used in §6, whose discrete subgroups are described in that
section. I show how this ‘three-dimensional’ discrete structure projects to the lower dimensional
‘base’, R?, via a certain group action 4:G x R? > R?.

Finally, I summarize the work and indicate how it may be extended and improved.

3. Measures of defectiveness, elastic invariants

In [11-14], Davini, Parry and Silhavy searched for ‘invariant integrals’ in the context of the above
kinematical model of defective crystals. These are circuit, closed surface or volume integrals (they
are to mimic atomistic procedures: counting point defects in a given volume; counting edge
dislocations crossing a given surface, for example) with integrands depending on the lattice vector
