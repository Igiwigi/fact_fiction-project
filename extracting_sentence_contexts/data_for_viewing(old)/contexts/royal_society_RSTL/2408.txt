188 DR. PHILIP ON THE NATURE OF DEATH.

is evident, equally, though not s0 immediately, depends on the agents which excite the
latter. Hence the harmony which exists between the living powers of the animal body
and the powers of inanimate nature. There is nothing in common in the nature of
these powers; but the organs of the former, being composed of the same materials
with the world which surrounds us, can be excited by no means but the agents which
operate in that world ; and on what principle could we expect any other result ?

These organs themselyes are a part of inanimate nature. Deprived of their vital
powers, they may still, as far as we see, be perfect in all their parts. On what their
vital powers depend, we know not. In the study of these powers, and the relation they
bear to the other powers of nature, we must be satisfied to take the facts as we find
them. And what other knowledge havye we of the inanimate powers themselves? Do
we know more of the nature of gravitation or electricity than of life ? It is the pro-
perties, not the essences, of things which are the objects of our senses. Our nature
must be changed before the latter can be made a subject of inquiry. Life is a certain
train of phenomena, depending on the peculiar state of its organs, produced by the
action of the same agents, which operate in other parts of nature, on the material
organs of our frame. We may arrange these phenomena in the way that best assists
the memory, and best shows their relation to each other and the other phenomena of
nature ; but no task can be more hopeless than the attempt to proceed one step further,
either with respect to the living powers or any other principle of action. Such an
attempt is beyond not merely the limits, but the nature, of our minds. It is the blind
attempting a knowledge of colours.
