DR. MARTIN BARRY ON THE CHORDA DORSALIS. 197

the 80-called © primitive trace,” by the formation of fresh substance in the interior
(compare with my fig. 122.). If 80, the formation of Bar's incipient chorda is not
simultaneous with, but snbsequent to, that of his © laminz dorsales.” (The © laminze
dorsales” of Barr correspond to RzicuerrT's © central nervous system.”)

Vox Bazr describes the chorda as © the axis, around which the first parts of the
fetus form.” The dark pin-like object we have been considering in the mammi-
ferons oyum, presents merely one of the many layers of incipient cells into which a
nucleus becomes resolved.

Notwithstanding these differences, however, facts mentioned by authors regarding
the chorda dorsalis at later periods I think afford evidence of the identity of the two
objects in question, as will be seen by what follows.

Rarvaks states that in osseous fishes the chorda dorsalis is inclosed in a membra-
nous sheath ; and that from this sheath there grow in pairs a great number of minute
filaments, which are the incipient crura of the arches of the vertebrae. The founda-
tions of the bodies of the vertebra appear, from the description given by this author,
_ to consist, of minute tables or traces, which proceed out of the vertebral arches; and
he adds, that © the thickening and ossification of the vertebra take place at the ex-
pense of the inclosed nucleus of the chorda{#.”
