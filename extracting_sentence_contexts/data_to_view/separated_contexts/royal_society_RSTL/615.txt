With regard to all these surrounding bodies, (excepting the
disks A and B,) as they are at the same temperature as the ball
of the thermoscope, (that of 72?,) they will give continually to
that instrument, just as much radiant caloric as they receive
from it; and no change of temperature will result from these
equal interchanges,

But, in respect to the disk A, as that is colder than the ball
of the thermoscope, it returns to it a smaller quantity of radiant
caloric than it receives from it ; consequently, the thermoscope
receives continually less than it gives: it would of course be
gradually exhausted of caloric, and become colder, were it not

for the compensation it receives for this loss, from the disk B,
This disk, being hotter than the thermoscope, gives to it con-
tinually, more radiant caloric than it receives from it; and,
were it not for the simultaneous loss of caloric which the instru-
ment sustains, in its interchanges with the cold disk A, its
quantity of caloric would be augmented, and it would become
hotter. Now, as the temperature of the ball of the thermoscope is an
arithmetical mean between that of the disk A and that of the
disk B, it is reasonable to suppose, that the thermoscope receives
just as much more caloric from B than it gives to it, as it gives
to A more than it receives from it; and, if that be the case in
fact, it is evident, that the simultaneous actions of the two disks
on the ball of the thermoscope (or the traffic which they carry
on with it in caloric) can neither tend to increase, nor to di-
minish, the original stock of that substance belonging to that
instrument ; consequently, the instrument will neither be heated,
nor cooled, by these interchanges, but will continue invariably
at the same constant temperature. This explanation is plausible; but, before the hypothesis on
which it is founded can be admitted, we must see if it will agree
with the results of other experiments; for the greatest care
ought always to be used in the admission of hypotheses in phy-
sical researches ; and, in no case can it be more indispensably
necessary, than where an hypothesis has evidently been con-
trived for the sole purpose of explaining a single experiment, or
elucidating a new fact. When the surface of the metallic disk B was blackened, by
holding it over the flame of a candle, the intensity of its radiation,

at the given temperature, (that of 112%) was found to be
very considerably increased; and when (being 80 blackened) it
was again presented to the ball of the thermoscope, at the same
distance as in the last-mentioned experiment, and the cold disk
A (at the temperature of g2*) was placed opposite to it, at an
equal distance, as represented in Fig. 5, the thermoscope, in-
stead of continuing to retain its original Trporanury, (that of
72*,) was now gradually heated. There is nothing, it is true, in that event, which appears-diffi-
cult to explain on the assumed principles; for, if the quantity of
radiant caloric emitted by the disk B, be increased by blackening
its surface; the quantity received from it by the ball of the ther-
moscope must be increased also; and that additional quantity
must of course tend to raise the temperature of the instrument,
But here is an experiment which cannot be explained on those
principles.
