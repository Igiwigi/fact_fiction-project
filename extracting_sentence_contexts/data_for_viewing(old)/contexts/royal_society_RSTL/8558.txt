Although I give the number of divisions shown by the luminous index, I attach
little importance to them as quantitative measurements. They are only single obser-
vations, and were taken before T had succeeded in getting any thing like the same
sensitiveness I can now attain in the apparatus. As illustrations of the fact, however,
that the more refrangible rays of the spectrum act as well as the lower rays, they may
be taken as trustworthy*®.

112. In my former paper on this subject I have already mentioned in detail that at
a certain point of rarefaction there is neither attraction nor repulsion when radiation
falls on the movable index (30, 43, 47, 66). I have long tried to ascertain the law
governing the position of this neutral point. My results are not yet ready for publi-
cation; but they are shaping themselves in order, and will, I trust, lead to a true
explanation of the cause of these phenomena.

'The barometric position of the neutral point dividing attraction from repulsion varies
according to cireumstances; among these may be mentioned the density of the sub-
