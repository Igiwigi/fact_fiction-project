pea, which possessed the remarkable property of shrivelling ex-
cessively when ripe; and, in the second year, 1 obtained white
seeds, from the gray ones above mentioned, perfectly similar to
it. I am strongly disposed to believe, that the seeds were here
of common parentage; but-I do not conceive myself to be. in
possession of facts sufficient-to enable? me to-speak with decision
on this question. If, however, the' female afford the first tau atom,-and
the farina act-only as'a stimulus, it appears to'me by no-means
impossible, that the explosion of two vesicles of farina, at the

I must believe this to have happened. Another” species of superfeetation-(if 1 have wo Nod
