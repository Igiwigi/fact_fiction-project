BY MEANS OF QUADRICS, AND THE REVERSE TRANSFORMATIONS. 343

surface is contained in the rule that ‘Y-primals have rational or elliptic plane sections
according as the prime sections of -surfaces are rational or elliptic.

As to the various other types of base elements which can occur in H-systems of primals,
we find that they are either such that by the special nature of quadric transformations
they cannot occur at all in ¥’, or they are such that when they do occur their existence
can easily be detected—usually from a consideration of base elements which we know
already. For example, since any three ¥-primals must intersect in a residual conic
only, primals of ¥" cannot have an isolated base point of contact, nor can they even
touch a fixed plane at an isolated base point of the plane. Also, if all ‘Y-primals had
a surface of contact, its existence could be detected by the fact that any two ‘Y-primals
must intersect in a residual surface of known order ; and a curve of contact would also
be noticed in a similar way. In practice, such special types of base element are difficult
to deal with ; but as they mostly occur only in special limiting cases of more general
quadric transformations, we shall not have much to do with them in this paper.

with each.

4.1. The Surface 1—The first type of ®-surface to be considered is the surface of
intersection of two general quadrics, and this surface we shall call I. It is well known that
I can be projected bi-rationally from a line / of itself into a plane w and that its prime
sections are represented on w by the system of cubic curves through five fundamental
