leaves; (3) certain moderately similar but more branched fructifications associated with
Baiera gracilis (see Black 1929); (4) similar fructifications associated with Baiera muen-
steriana (see Florin 1949, p. 95); and finally (5) Trichopitys heteromorpha Sap. recently
described and discussed by Florin (1949). This remarkable plant bears axillary female
‘trusses’ which seem to be very like the more richly branched type of female organ found
in Gingko biloba. Microscopic details are lacking, but the appearance of the ‘seeds’ strongly
suggests that they are true seeds and not little seed-bearing capsules like those of Leptostrobus.

My imagination can only bridge the gap between any of these Ginkgoales and Lepto-
strobus by going right back to a Psilophytalean type of organization of telomes and phyllomes.
This is another way of saying they seem unrelated.

Leptostrobus (with Czekanowskia) has in fact the same sort of relation to the Ginkgoales as
Taxus has to the conifers. Taxus and its immediate allies agree perfectly with the conifers
in their vegetative organs, but the organization of the female organs is so different as to
make any relationship too obscure to be profitable to follow at the present time.

Leptostrobus requires a new major group to accommodate it, but for reasons given below
this group is not yet proposed.

(1) It seems very likely that a fresh study of really good material, such as that originally
described by Heer, would greatly enrich and perhaps materially alter any characterization
at present possible. In particular, it is desirable to know more about the organization of
the seed. It is unfortunate also that male organs are lacking.
