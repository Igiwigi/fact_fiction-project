naturally arises, “ Is it Heemocyanin”? To answer this question it would be necessary
to discuss the prevalent views as to the nature and functions of Hxemocyanin. We
propose to leave this discussion for the present and to content ourselves here with
recording several facts. In the first place the blue colour of nocturnes (Macromysis)
is not discharged by carbon dioxide, so that, if the discharge of colour by this gas is a
decisive test for Heemocyanin, we must conclude that the blue substance of Macromysis
is a different body. In the second place, the blood of M. nigra, which is constantly
alkaline, exhibits variations of colour. It is colourless in some, and blue in other
animals. This blueness we may add in conclusion counts (except in certain green
colour-forms) for nothing in diurnal coloration, for then it is masked by the closely
woven cloak of diurnal colour.

Though the facts which we have set forth in this section do not warrant a complete
or confident hypothesis, we claim that they show :—

1. That the blue substance, to which the characteristic nocturnal colour of Hippolyte
varians is due, differs physically and physiologically from the red and yellow
diurnal pigments.

2. That the nocturnal blue pigment of Hippolyte, and a similar diurnal blue
substance of Palamon, is produced at the expense of the red and yellow ones ;
that it exudes from the chromatophores, permeates the tissues, and
subsequently disappears.

3. That its production in JHippolyte is contemporaneous with the appearance of
