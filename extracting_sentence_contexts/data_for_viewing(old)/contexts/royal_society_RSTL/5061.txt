£by the physical philosopher to conclusions deduced from experiments of the following
nature, he has naturally felt some hesitation in presenting the following communica-
Stion to the Society. As no attempt, that he is aware of, has been made to refute the
former conclusions by experimental evidence, it only remains for him to state that he
S has treated the subject more as a physiologist, and for physiologists, than for physicists ;
that he has not considered himself called upon to refute every objection the physical
| palocopher might be supposed to raise; and that he has endeayoured at the same
E time to avoid every thing of a controversial character.
5 Precautions. —Instead of entering fully into all the precautions necessary to be
aoary: in researches of the following description, we shall refer to the works of
SFarapay®, Marrevccarf and BecquertLt. We must however bear in mind that it
& is not the mere fact of getting an effect upon the needle of the galvanometer that is
& to satisfy us; that can be readily obtained : we have to point out to what class of phe-
6 nomena the effects may be referred,
3 As it appeared desirable to condense the experiments as much as possible, we
S hall make a few general remarks as to the mode in which the experiments were
a performed. The whole arrangement was ascertained to be in a good working con-
dition previous to each set of experiments. As an objection might be started to the
use of the former electrodes, two others were procured of platinum wire, No. 16 gauge,
each a foot in length, and from the same piece of wire. Smaller wooden mercurial
cups were also used, and it was at these cups that the making and breaking of con-
tacts were made. The extremities of the electrodes were well cleaned after and pre-
vious to the formation of each circuit; moreover, the electrodes were held lightly in
the hand, not squeezed.
