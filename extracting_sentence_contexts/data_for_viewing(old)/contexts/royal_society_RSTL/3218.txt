appear necessary to establish the object I have in view, and it is hoped the
want, of noyelty will be compensated by the importance of the subject under
consideration.

That a ship's compass is subject to a deviation from its true direction in
consequence of the attraction of the iron used in the construction and appoint-
ments of the vessel, is now too generally admitted to require any argument,
although I believe there may be still some few officers who are sceptical on this
point ; I have at least been seriously assnred by one of rank and long standing,
that there certainly was no local attraction when he was at sea.‚Äù Now there
is really more in this observation than one would imagine, for there can be no
question that forty years back the error arising from this disturbing force was
very inconsiderable to what it is at present ; every year in fact increasing
the amount, and rendering a correction of the error more and more necessary.
This increase is occasioned by the immense quantity of iron now employed in
the construction of a ship of war and its appointments. At the period above

alluded to, iron ballast and iron tanks were perhaps scarcely known ; now we
have, besides these, iron knees, iron cables, and above all iron capstans, besides
various other articles of the same material, which together form such an
attracting mass, that if we cannot allow that there was no local attraction
