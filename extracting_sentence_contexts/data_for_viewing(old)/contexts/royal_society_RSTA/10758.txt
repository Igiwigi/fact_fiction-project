The ammonium chloride serves, by its solvent action, to keep the surface of the
metallic particles free from this cuprous chloride, which would otherwise delay
dissolution.

Zine placed in the solution precipitates finely divided copper from the cupric
chloride, and this copper is rapidly re-dissolved, as explained above.

The solution was found to dissolve the alloys rapidly unless the percentage of
copper was greater than 60, and, owing to this circumstance, the experiments were
not continued beyond the alloy containing 62°2 per cent. of copper.

This difficulty arose from the fact that it was impossible to obtain those alloys
which are rich in copper in a sufficiently comminuted state.

Specific Heat of the Solution.
This was found in a manner similar to that previously described.
In three successive experiments the following values were obtained :—
(i.) 8102 (ii.) +8102 (iii) *812.
Mean value = °8108.

In the experiments which follow, the calorimeter always contained 520 grammes

of the solution, and the water equivalent was
(520 x *8108) + 16 = 437°6 grammes.
