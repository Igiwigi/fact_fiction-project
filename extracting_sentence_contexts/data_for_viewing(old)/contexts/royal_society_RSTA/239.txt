4.3). Notice that, in figure 4b, the equilibria are located along the horizontal
axis where the amplitudes of velocity oscillations are zero. We remark that the
reaction time makes h4! (hH?) slightly smaller (larger) than the non-delayed case.

As explained in the previous section, by analysing the linearized model (5.1),
one may conclude that travelling waves of the form (5.3) emerge (with k=1),
but it is not possible to determine the amplitude v*™? and stability of the small-
amplitude oscillations that appear. By including nonlinearities up to third order
in the modelling equations (3.10), (3.12), (6.1), one may perform normal form
calculations and conclude that these waves are unstable (the Hopf bifurcation is
subcritical) and derive the amplitudes v°™? ~ /hl! — h* and vam? ~ J/h* — h¥? in
the vicinity of the Hopf points (Orosz & Stépan 2006). This robustly subcritical
behaviour is primarily attributed to the fact that the driver reaction time is
finite—for zero reaction time, one needs to carefully tune other parameters
to obtain such behaviour. When performing such analytical calculations, the
nonlinearities of V are only approximated well close to the Hopf points, so
one needs to use numerical techniques to track the unstable solutions for larger
|h* — h®"|, e.g. numerical continuation techniques need to be applied (Roose &
Szalai 2007; Orosz et al. 2009).

In figure 4b, the thin curve shows the oscillation amplitude v’™P. One
may observe that further away from the Hopf points the amplitude increases
approximately linearly with |h* — h¥"| until reaching h* ~ h~ or h* ~ h*, where
the branch folds back (a fold bifurcation occurs) and a stable section connecting
the two fold points is created. The fold points are marked by blue crosses
