rapidly to changing climate but also because there are multiple aerosol compositions, they
have complex radiative properties and they affect clouds in several ways, thus making accurate
knowledge of their glacial—interglacial changes inaccessible.

The temporal variation of the GHG plus surface albedo climate forcing closely mimics the
temporal variation of either the deep ocean temperature (figure 6) or Antarctic temperature [5,31]
for the entire 800000 years of polar ice core data. However, the temperature change must be
converted to the global mean to allow inference of climate sensitivity. The required scale factor
is commonly extracted from an estimated LGM-—Holocene global temperature change, which,
however, is very uncertain, with estimates ranging from approximately 3°C to approximately
6°C. Thus, for example, the climate sensitivity (1.7-2.6°C for 2 x COz) estimated by Schmittner
et al. [94] is due largely to their assumed approximately 3°C cooling in the LGM, and in lesser part
to the fact that they defined some aerosol changes (dust) to be a climate forcing.

Climate sensitivity extracted from Pleistocene climate change is thus inherently partly
subjective as it depends on how much weight is given to mutually inconsistent estimates
of glacial-to-interglacial global temperature change. Our initial assessment is a fast-feedback


sensitivity of 3+1°C for 2 x CO2, corresponding to an LGM cooling of 4.5°C, similar to the
2.2-4.8°C estimate of PALAEOSENS [99]. This sensitivity is higher than estimated by Schmittner
et al. [94], partly because they included natural aerosol changes as a forcing. In addition, we
note that their proxies for LGM sea surface cooling exclude planktic foraminifera data, which
suggest larger cooling [126], and, as noted by Schneider von Deimling et al. [95], regions
that are not sampled tend to be ones where the largest cooling is expected. It should be
