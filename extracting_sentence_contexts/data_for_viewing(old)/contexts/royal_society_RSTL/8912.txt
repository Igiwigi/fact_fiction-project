ring continued, of course, to contract, and this at firs more rapidly than uaual. On
the other hand, all spontaneity ceased in the other part of the animal after an interval
of three hours. Dr. Fixer then suwbmitted this open ring to a series of interdigi-
tating cuts. He found that in no one of its parts was the physiological continuity of
the tissue destroyed by the sections, although it seemed to him that the SOFGTEX forms
of 8uch section tended partially to obstruct the passage of the contractile influence
from one division to anotherâ€”that the thinner the connecting link of tissue, the

greater was the resistance which it offered to such passage. Therefore, in view
of the fact "that the physiological connexions only appear to be certain 80 long as the
connecting portions of tissue are not narrowed down below a certain point, Dr. EiMeR
concludes in favour of a neryous plexus peryading the contractile tissues rather than
in favour of the functional homogeneity of these tissues. He observes, however, very
Justly, that if such a plexus is present, its fibres must be capable in a high degree of
vicarious action. Dr. Engr states further, that the amount of tissue which proves
sufficient to maintain physiological continuity between any two almost severed parts
differs in different portions of the umbrella.

The paper concludes with several theories as to other possible functions which the
lithocysts may have to subserve as well as that of locomotion, e. g. respiration and
nutrition ; but as these theories are not supported by any observations or experiments,
it seems unnecessary to adduce them here. It therefore only remains to state that
