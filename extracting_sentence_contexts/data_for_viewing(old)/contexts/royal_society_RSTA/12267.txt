£ (/) That the generality of the effects of the properties on which the action of trans-

@formation depends is proved by the fact that resistance, other than proportional to

the velocity, is caused by the relative (eddying) mean-motion.

existence of the criterion, the dependence of which on circumstances which limit the

“Zmagnitudes of the periods of relative mean-motion, as compared with the heat-motion,
