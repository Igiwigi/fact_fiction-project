A. MAC MUNN ON THE CHROMATOLOGY OF ACTINLA. 649

zolution filtered through asbestos ; in this solution the acid haematoporphyrin
trum was plainly seen, much more plainly than in the case of other Actini,
"80 that readings could be easily taken, the firss band extended from X 613 to
A 596'5, and the second from X 566 to X 551 ; here a third feeble shading from X 524-5
to A 501 was also een. On comparing these readings with those got in former cases
the agreement is tolerably close, especially when we take into consideration the fact
that in the case of Actinia mesembryanthemum the bands of a 8olution diluted with
rectified spirit were measured, while here the pigment was dissolved in pure 8ulIphuric
acid. In the latter case the pigment could also be converted into alkaline hzmato-
& porphyrin. Q If a Bunodes crassicornis be taken whose tentacles show the actiniohzematin band,
vandif the tentacles be extracted with glycerin, the s0lution shows a much broader band
Z between D and E than that of Actiniochrome ; then on adding caustic soda the band
Sis made fainter, and on adding sulphide of ammonium the hzmochromogen bands
Bare seen with distinctness, but if those tentacles which show Professor MosELEY's
ZActiniochrome are treated in the same way a negative result is obtained.
