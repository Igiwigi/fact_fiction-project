130 Mr. Cnrxevix on the Action, &c.

saying that he will return to the subject. From the labours of
such persons some great and important fact must issue, and I
hope that the present subject will not be excluded from their
consideration. The facts contained in this Paper cannot be
submitted to too severe a scrutiny ; and no judge can be more
rigid or more competent than the very person who was the
first to doubt my former experiments. But it is necessary to
be observed by whoever $hall think them worth the trouble of
verifying, that even these experiments are liable to fail unless
proper precautions are used: that I have never operated upon
less than one hundred grains; and that the results, which 1
have stated, however simple they may appear, have been the
constant labour of s0me weeks.
