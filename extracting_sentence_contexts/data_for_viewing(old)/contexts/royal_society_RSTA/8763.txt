The magnification of the various photographs was not completely identical in all
cases. On the original plate, the distance between the lines \\6678, 3888, was
44°95 mm. If this distance be measured on any individual photograph, its
magnification m is deduced by simple division. On photographs I.—V. inclusive, we
found m = 3°181, and on photographs VI.—VIIL., m = 3°159.

Some of the Helium bands appear on the intermediate photographs, though absent
very close to the cathode, and again at some distance from it. They are, in fact, only
shown on the photographs [V.—VIL., according to the details set forthin Table II. The
wave-lengths are only rough values serving to identify the individual bands, and the
values of d, are obtained as before from the calibration curve of the wedge. We
merely record in the table some of the more conspicuous examples of these bands, as
an illustration of their behaviour. We do not propose to discuss them, for they are

in reality band heads consisting of a large number of nearly overlapping lines, and
