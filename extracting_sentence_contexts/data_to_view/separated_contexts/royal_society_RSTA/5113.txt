The well-known spark spectra of these elements are spectra of the 2nd Order. Lecog bE BoisBaupRAN has’ observed a beautiful spectrum of aluminium of the

Ist Order, obtained by means of an uncondensed spark. That this metal at so high
a temperature yields such a spectrum is undoubtedly due to the fact that it is
almost, if not absolutely, impossible to vaporize it with the oxy-hydrogen flame. Livernc and Dewar have recently obtained a band spectrum by the combustian
of nickel tetracarbonyl which is also accompanied by lines (‘ Roy. Soc, Proc., vol. 52,
p. 117).
