However,
outputs from AOGCMs have highlighted a clear disconnection between the proxy data, which
are representative of a time slab, and relatively short model integrations that predict a climate
state based on constant external forcing [17]. The motivation for defining a new time slice is the
hypothesis that a component of this model-data inconsistency is related to the time slab nature
of the proxy data. While there have been a number of attempts to evaluate AOGCMs against the PRISM dataset,
the fact that data and models are not reproducing the same objective, ie. a discrete moment in
time during the mPWP, makes the identification of any true model bias impossible [14,16,17,30]. In reality, a climate model simulation run for 1000 integrated years, using only a single realization :
of orbit, CO2 and other forcings, cannot reproduce a reconstruction of average warm climate as
conditions that is a product of multiple and changing/interacting forcing mechanisms. i

What does this imply for previous mid-Pliocene-based estimates of Earth system sensitivity? 23
Changes in the Earth’s orbit are not relevant to calculations of either climate or Earth system :s
sensitivity. If reconstructed changes in global ice volume or vegetation distribution are largely =
or even partly a function of orbital variability rather than CO2, then the utility of the mPWP for al
understanding the sensitivity of climate in the context of future climate change is diminished. :g
Transient mid-Pliocene climate simulations using an Earth system model of intermediate :&
complexity are becoming available.
