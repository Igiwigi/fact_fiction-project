starch
solution for 1 hour 40 minutes. After titration, the weights of cupric oxide were,
A, 0398 grm., B, 0218 grm., C (standard) â€˜0438. There was a destruction in B of
50 per cent., but in A of only 9 per cent., so that the alcohol was a very effective
screen, Further experiments and observations with the spectroscope led to the
conclusion that this reagent is like glass in its opacity to the ultra-violet rays, The
protection it affords is not perfect, which is probably attributable to the fact that it
allows all the blue and violet rays to pass, for, as we have seen, these are most likely
deleterious, though to a less extent than those of the ultra-violet region. The impossibility at present of preparing an extract of chlorophyll which can be
used as a satisfactory screen to a diastasic solution during illumination, renders the
proof of its possible protective power very difficult. Various considerations, however,
that will be discussed more fully later, point very strongly to such a conclusion,
