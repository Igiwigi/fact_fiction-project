ences in methods and models as well as the selection of
model predictors, and the extent to which the assumptions
made about a species’ biology are appropriate [19,20].
Recent advances to predict future habitat suitability
include mechanistic SDMs that explicitly integrate physi-
ology, demographics, dispersal and biotic interactions
[12,13]. Mechanistic SDMs simulate processes hypothesized
via rules or equations that have biologically meaningful par-
ameters to represent the fundamental niche of a species [13].
While mechanistic SDMs are considered by some authors to
be more robust and theoretically defensible than correlative
SDMs for predicting species’ responses to global change,
extensive application is currently precluded by the fact that
they require detailed data that are lacking for most species
[14]. The main sources of uncertainty in mechanistic SDMs
relate to model parameters, and to combining data collected
at different spatial resolution [12,13]. Mechanistic SDMs, for
example, can overcome traditional correlative SDM limit-
ations for species that have naturally restricted distributions
[21] and when making predictions under novel climates [22].
