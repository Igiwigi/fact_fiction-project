To suppose that the upper part of the uninsulated ball B, should in some way
be retained in an electrified state by that portion of the surface which is in sight of
the sbell-lac, would be in opposition to what we know already of the subject. Elec-
tricity is retained upon the surface of conductors only by induction (1178.); and
though some persons may not be prepared as yet to admit this with respect to in-
sulated conductors, all will as regards uninsulated conductors like the ball B; and
to decide the matter we have only to place the carrier ball at e (fig. 4.), s0 that it shall
not come in contact with B, uninsulate it by a metallic rod descending perpendicu-
larly, insulate it, remove it, and examine its state ; it will be found charged with the
same kind of electricity as, and even to a higher degree (1224.) than, if it had been in
contact with the summit of B.

1221. To suppose, again, that induction acts in s0me way through or across the
metal of the ball, is negatived by the simplest considerations ; but a fact in proof
will be better. If instead of the ball B a small disc of metal be used, the carrier may
be charged at, or aboye the middle of its upper surface : but if the plate be enlarged

to about 14 or 2 inches in diameter, C (fig. 5.), then no charge will be given to the
carrier at f, though when applied nearer to the edge at g, or even above the middle at
h, a charge will be obtained ; and this is true though the plate may be a mere thin
film of gold leaf. Hence it is clear that the induction is not through the metal, but
through the air or dielectric, and that in curved lines.
