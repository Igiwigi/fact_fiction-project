* No one had supposed,” says he, © before Dr. Wes, that terrestrial substances, ex-
cepting in the case of a very rapid evaporation, may acquire during the night a dif-
ferent temperature from that of the surrounding air. This important fact is now well
ascertained. On placing little masses of cotton down, &c. in the open air, it is fre-
quently observed that they acquire a temperature 6?, 7*®, or even 8? centigr. below
that of the surrounding atmosphere..... These differences of temperature between
solid bodies and the atmosphere only rise to 6?, 7*, or 8? of the centesimal scale, when
the sky is perfectly clear.
