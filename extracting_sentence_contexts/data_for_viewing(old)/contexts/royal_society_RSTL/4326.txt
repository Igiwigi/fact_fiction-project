on the tides; one, containing the time and rise of the tide at a great numher of places,
the other containing some general remarks, to which I have already referred. Cap-
tain FirzzRoy notices the features in the tides of the Pacific partly as Admiral Du
Perir-Trovars does. Thus he says (p. 281),—

«It is high water at Cape Pillar and at Chiloe, including the intermediate coast,
almost at one time: from Valdivia to the Bay of Mexillones (differing eighteen de-
grees in latitude) there is not an hour's difference in the time of high water: from
Arica to Payta the times vary gradually as the coast trends westward : from Panama
to California, the times also change gradually as the coast trends westward : and
from forty to sixty north, high water takes place at one time.”

Captain FirzRoy combines these and many other facts respecting the tides into a
hypothetical general view of the movement of the ocean, which may be of service in
provoking further inquiry, though it can hardly be considered tenable in detail, as
perhaps the present memoir may serve to show.

28. In the Philosophical Transactions for 1840*, I mentioned and discussed certain
remarkable tide observations made at Petropaulofsk in Kamtschatka, which I had
received from Admiral Lurks. That officer has since combined several tide obser-
vations of his own and others, in a © Notice sur les Mar6es Periodiques dans le Grand
Ocean Boreal et dans la Mer Glaciale,” and has, in a chart of the North Pacific
attached to this notice, drawn the cotidal lines belonging to that ocean. I will place
here an extract from this Notice, pointing out the grounds on which he proceeds, and
the difficulty in which he finds himself involved.
