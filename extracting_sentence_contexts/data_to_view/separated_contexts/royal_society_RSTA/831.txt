Secondly,
for simplicity, we are going to make the assumption that V, is indeed the restriction of an actual
connection V. This will allow us to speak more freely of geometric concepts such as the contorsion


tensor. In fact this assumption is not critical; if the Poisson tensor in these coordinates is w”, then | 10 |
we are in most formulae making use only of the combination V“ := w“V,, rather than the full

covariant derivatives V,, themselves. It means that our data have redundant ‘auxiliary modes’ “a
that do not affect the quantum differential structure at order 4, a situation not unfamiliar from [a
other situations such as gauge theory. There is also the matter of extending from 2! to forms of is

all degrees but this turns out [27] to impose no further conditions.
