Be) As a plant of unique vegetative habit, producing flowers also unique among
3B existing Gymnosperms, Welwitschia requires no introduction to the botanical student ;
> and, since the time of its original description by Hooker (1864), numerous observers
S have given an account of its special features, chiefly from anatomical or cytological
g points of view, the most important of these being Pranson’s last contribution to
g the study of the process of fertilisation (Puarson, ‘ Phil. Trans.,’ B, 1908).

¢ Similar material has been more recently exhaustively examined by SyKzs (1910),
3 and Lrenter and Tison (1912); so that, though little more new information may be
3S obtainable, it may be of general interest to consider the details from a new standpoint,
i and a concise revision of the facts of observation may be useful at this stage. The
a literature of the subject has been recently so fully catalogued by Lienrer and Tison
(‘ Ann. Sci. Nat.,’ Bot., 1912, p. 180) that further references, except to classical well-
known papers, are really uncalled for.

As the number of investigators of Welwitschia increases, so the amount of
theoretical speculation also grows, and it becomes increasingly important to dis-
tinguish between actual details and facts which may be observed, and the often
extremely erroneous conceptions which may have been founded on them, and to
distinguish clearly the nature of the evidence, on which elaborate, and possibly very
far fetched, hypotheses have been based.

It was from the outset intended that a special feature should be made of suitable
