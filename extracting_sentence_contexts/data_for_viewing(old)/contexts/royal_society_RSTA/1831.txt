The state of the theory could hardly be more different. The standard prediction of A from
quantum field theory deviates from the observed value by 120 orders of magnitude [6]. This state
of affairs is reflected in the contemporary scientific term for A: dark energy.! The term conjures up
a picture of some dark force filling the universe, while in reality it just says that current theoretical
physics is unable to shed light on what ‘dark energy’ really is. While there are many attempts [6,9]
to derive the cosmological term, none has been fully convincing—in the following sense. Physical

'n this paper, dark energy and the cosmological constant are taken as synonyms. One may also adopt a broader point of
view and call all sources of repulsive gravity ‘dark energy’.


theories do not just give quantitative explanations of measured facts, but they connect the facts
across several different areas of empirical investigation. The larger the range of explanation the
more valuable is the theory and the more likely it is that the theory captures a portion of the truth.
The attempts of deriving the cosmological constant from theory seem to fall into two categories:
either they are off by many orders of magnitude, if they originate from other known physics,
or they are highly specialized and therefore highly speculative. Yet a physically well-motivated
explanation [10] was put forward more than half a century ago.

Zel'dovich [10] suggested in 1968 that Einstein’s cosmological term [1] comes from the physics
of the quantum vacuum [11,12]. The quantum vacuum is the ground state of the physical fields—
the electromagnetic field and the fields of weak and strong interaction. Fields are thought of
as being collections of harmonic oscillators, one for each field mode, and the ground state of
a harmonic oscillator is known to carry a zero-pointy energy and to appear with a fluctuating
