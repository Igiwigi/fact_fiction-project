framework that (i) allows us to analyse the data, but

(ii) is also computationally feasible. The fact that

genetic processes such as mutation and recombination

do not occur uniformly along the DNA sequence has

led to a flurry of activity aimed at describing and

interpreting this variation. The authors present a novel

approach at doing just this aimed at detecting hotspots

of recombination. Understanding patterns of recombi-
