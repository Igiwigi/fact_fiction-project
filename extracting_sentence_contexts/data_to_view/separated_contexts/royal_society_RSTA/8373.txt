As it was
necessary to shut off from the air the space in
which the crystal was suspended and which also
contained the liquefied gas and its vapour, a
fairly complicated cryogenic apparatus had to be
employed. This is shown in section in fig. 8. It consists principally of three tubular portions Fig. 8.

* The apparatus is, in fact, the one referred to “ depending on the use of couples b, apparatus for crystals
(to be constructed) ” in‘ Leiden Comm.,’ No. 139A, p. 6, in which the programme of the laboratory as regards
magnetic researches is outlined. VOL, COXXIV.—-A,. E
