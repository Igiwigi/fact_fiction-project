We are accordingly retaining the use of the terms lux (or metre-candle) and
kilolux for the presentation of our results, but would like to emphasize that they
are used to measure the response of the cell and not the visual effect of the radiation
on the eye. Similarly, where the term “ luminous efficiency ” is used it must be
understood to mean the “ light” as measured by the cell divided by the energy of
the radiation as measured by a sensitive thermopile. With the cells used and the
methods of standardization already described* the discrepancies between the scales
are unlikely to be comparable to the very large variations that occur—sometimes
with great rapidity—in daylight.

Apart from the above considerations we must evidently define what we mean by
the illumination at a given point. The problem is complicated by the fact that we
have to deal with light travelling in many different directions, the angular distribution
varying greatly at different times. Thus with a uniform cloudy sky the light may be
approximately uniform over one hemisphere. In addition to this direct skylight
there will be some light reflected off the ground, possibly snow covered, or the water.

Several definitions of illumination are possible. Thus we may define it as the
vertical illumination in lux (metre-candles) falling on a horizontal surface. This is
what is actually measured by photometers, set with opal receiving surface horizontal,
when certain small corrections have been applied for reflexion losses at the opal
surface, and is denoted throughout by the letter V.

Another definition, which is very useful in photometric measurements in woods,
