Some Ornithorhynchus sections which I have examined
confirm that there is no corpus trapezoideum, and that the auditory decussations
resemble those in the Sauropsida where there is likewise no corpus trapezoideum. CEREBELLUM OF ECHIDNA ACULEATA 29 This is to be expected in view of the fact that the labyrinth in Ornithorhynchus shows
little or no advance upon that of reptiles and birds. In the Sauropsida the chief
auditory crossing is the intermediate decussation of HELD, as can be seen in the papers
by Scnepman (1918), Kappers (1921), WinKLER (1918), and Huser and Crossy
(1926). Hep (1893) demonstrated that it myelinates at an earlier stage than the
others and is to be regarded as phylogenetically older.
