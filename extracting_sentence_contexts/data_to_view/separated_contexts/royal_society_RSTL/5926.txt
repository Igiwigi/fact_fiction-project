The grey substance is
at length reduced to a mere border-or fringe (fig. 25), from the edges of which a series
of tapering processes (a, a) extend through the white snbstance to the pia mater at the

and when hardened with chromic acid, that STiLL1x6's denial of the fact seems to me unaccountable. MR. J.
