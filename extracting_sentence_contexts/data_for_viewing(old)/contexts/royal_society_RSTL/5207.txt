an exceedingly delicate transparent pellicle may be traced in continuity with it over

tentacula,

It is certain that the cavity of the polypary increases in diameter, up to a certain
point, with the growth of the animal, a fact which we can reconcile with the account
Just given of its formation, only by attributing to it a capacity of distension 8uhse-
quently to its original deposition.

2. The Endoderm and its Cavity.

The endoderm (fig. 3, d, 4) constitutes a very distinctly cellular layer; it is in
contact throughout with the ectoderm, but is nevertheless distinguishable from it by
a very decided boundary, and can only be considered as directly continnous with it
at the mouths of the polypes. It forms the walls of an uninterrupted cavity, which,
extending through the axis of the entire zoophyte, opens externally at the polype-
mouths. This cavity may be divided into four distinct regions, namely, the post-buccal
cavity, the sfomach, the tentacular canals, and the canal of the eenosarc, a division
