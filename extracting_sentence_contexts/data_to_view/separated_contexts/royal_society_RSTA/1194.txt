Electrification of the particles being suspected, the tube was silvered
and polished inside, and the silver coating earthed. It is doubtful whether real
clectrification effects were present in the unsilvered tube, the irregularities being
afterwards traced to other causes. Since the spacing in the cylindrical tube is clearly influenced by the fact that there
are very few particles in the extreme ridges, experiments were then carried out with
wax spheres in a square tube. Very uniform particles graded with the slit, of diameter
about 0-29 mm., were used in these experiments. Ridges are formed across the
tube, but with the wax spheres they are not quite so straight as they are with the cork
particles.
