3 Results obtained by Muhly (1943) indicate that the general problem of finding workable
onditions sufficient for GS to have an n-term #-basis is too difficult to be tackled at present.
aPhe corresponding local problem{—conditions for GS, to have an n-term R,,-basis—is
robably much simpler; but of course Theorems | and 2 cannot be regarded as a solution.
‘it would be natural to include the following among the postulates: (i) R = R, a unique
factorization domain, (ii) S = G, integrally closed. Assuming (i), it would be enough to
find conditions sufficient for D to be a v-ideal§ of R. Since Theorem 3 shows that under
“certain circumstances e is a v-ideal of G, it seems that (3.13) may be relevant; a solution of
