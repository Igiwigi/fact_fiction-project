derived from the Abietinew; even normal resin canals might quite logically be
expected here, whereas neither traumatic nor normal are present, at least neither
have been described. JEFFREY makes the traumatic revival of resin canals, as has
been stated above, the crucial point in determining whether the other transitional
features, pitting, medullary ray structure, etc., shall be interpreted as indicative
of the derivation of Araucarines from the Abietiness or the reverse. The facts
presented above make it impossible to consider the resin canals of Araucariopitys
as of the revival type.

Another feature which Prof. Jerrrey emphasises in his transitional forms is
the presence of a spur shoot. This he considers “a primitive attribute of the
coniferous stock,” which “has persisted, at least in a vestigial form, in connection
with the reproductive apparatus long after it has disappeared, or almost disappeared,
in the vegetative axis of the living Conifers, with the exception of the very ancient
genus Pinus” (19104, p. 331). In his extensive monograph on the Abietinez he
(1905) has marshalled the evidence in favour of the brachyblast theory of the
ovuliferous scale, citing the vegetative parallel in the leaves of Sciadopitys, the
teratological occurrence of vegetative shoots in place of the ovuliferous scale (p. 29),
