To allow for such a stable period-1 carrier waveform, the band-pass character for h(t)
is necessary (stable period-1 pattern have been analysed e.g. in [77]), since the low-pass one is
known to lead to unstable period-1 pattern, as was reported in [25] about the ‘coarsening’ of any
forced initial pattern in the virtual spatial domain. Last but not least, one could also mention
that with a fixed t,, the impulse response with ty (band-pass) necessarily exhibits a broader
width than without the presence of ty (low-pass). This remark is in line with the known fact that
chimera states are favoured when the coupling range is extended (i.e. beyond the classical case of
nearest-neighbour coupling only, which does not allow for chimera states). There are also specific requirements on the nonlinear coupling function F(x) for obtaining
chimera solutions. This is illustrated in figure 9, where both the nonlinear function profile is
represented, and next to it, with the same vertical scaling, the temporal chimera waveform.
