AND THE ORGANISMS COMPOSING IT. 155

the true “ Ginger-beer” Schizomycete ; or, the latter organism does really lose its
sheaths, and live and multiply as a free moving bacillus-like form, until certain
changes in the environment compel it once more to assume the sheathed state.

The latter seemed the more likely alternative, because the very fact of the suc-
cessful cultures containing so many of the free rodlets during the early stages would
seem to disprove the former; nevertheless, of course it does not do to lay too much
stress on such evidence where bacteria are concerned.

Such was the state of affairs at which [ took up the re-investigation of the particular
form referred to.

A considerable step forward was made in December, 1890, when I found the case
recorded in fig. 7, Plate 13. Specimens of both yeasts and rodlets of a clean culture
of the Ginger-beer plant were growing together in a hanging-drop of ginger-
gelatine. My attention at the time was being more particularly directed to the
yeast. After two days, however, it became evident that the rodlets among the yeasts
