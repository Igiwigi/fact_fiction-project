'= of any part of the organism modify the rhythm of the marginal ganglia most profoundly.
S That this modification does not proceed from shock, would seem to be indicated
g by the facts that the first effect of the mutilation is to quicken the rhythm, that
s there is a sort of general proportion to be observed between the amount of tissue
2 abstracted and the degree of slowing of the rhythm produced, and that the slowing effects
= continue for 80 long a time. All these facts seem to show that we haye here something
'3 other than mere shock to deal with. A strong suspicion, therefore, arises that the cause
<4 of the slowing of the rhythm which results from removing the polypite, or a part of the
> general contractile tissue of the bell, consists in the destruction of some influence of an
= afferent character which had preyiously emanated from the parts of the organizm which
& have been removed; and that the normal rhythm before the operation was partly due
<= to a continuous reception, on the part of the ganglia, of this afferent or stimulating
S influence. In support of this view are the facts that the first effect of 8uch an operation
â€” as we are considering is greatly to accelerate the rhythm, and that this acceleration then
V gradually declines through a period of about a quarter of an hour, 'These facts tend to
= support this view, because, if it is correct, they are what we might anticipate. If the
Z polypite, for instance, while i 8, is continually supplying a gentle stimulus to the
A marginal ganglia, when it is suddenly cut off, the nerve-tracts through which this
stimulating influence had previously been conveyed must be cut through ; and as it is
well known hoy irritable nerve-fibres are at their points of section, it is to be expected
that the irritation caused by cutting these nerve-tracts, and probably also the action of
the sea-water on their cut extremities, would cause them to stimulate the ganglia more
powerfully than they did before their mutilation. And here I may state that on several
occasions, with vigorous specimens, I have observed a sudden removal of the polypite to
be followed, not merely with a quickening of the rhythm on the part of the bell, but
