Anterior and antero-
Rteral columnar fibres on opposite side. On the other hand, the more extensive the
Bsion transversely, the more bi-lateral was the degeneration. I never found any
@sproportion between the size of the lesion and the resulting change, a fact which
ved the accuracy of the Marchi method.
= The severity of the symptoms, it will also be observed, is related both to the
@ndition of the wound and the resulting degenerative changes. In those cases
Mhere the recovery of the paralysis on the right side was not good, there was exten-
five degeneration of the anterior and antero-lateral columnar fibres. But, as the
ey in these columns is only a measure of the severity of the wound, the
ost useful comparison is that between the condition of the wound and the
Symptoms.
