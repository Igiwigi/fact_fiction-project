only form mentioned by Mr. WtRNER) appears to me not to
exist. To this species belongs that Tn in Mr, KLaproTH's
analysis, afforded him 2; of copper, 5; of iron, and 22; of
sulphur; and which Mr. WERNER makes His second sub-species
of vitreous copper, under the denomination of lamellated vitreous
$opper ; but it is in fact a variety of the Buntkupfererz, not of
the vitreous copper. It is true indeed, that this latter sometimes
contains a portion of iron, but always a very inconsiderable
one, within its substance; and, when that happens, the iron
is totally foreign to its composition. Among the analyses of
the various combinations of copper with sulphur, which Mr.
CHENEvVIX was $0 good as to make at my request, (the speci-
mens for that purpose having been furnished by me,) one was
that of a very pure sulphuret of copper, which came from
Cornwall, and was in crystals of a perfectly determinate form.
