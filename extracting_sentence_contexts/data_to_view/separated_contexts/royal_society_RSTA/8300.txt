Con-

would have to be made for all other constituents, and not for those of the same species
only.

10.2. Such in essence is BOrGENâ€™s method, but the daily multipliers are replaced
by +1, and so the principles of the Least Square Rule are still further ignored. There
is probably no real objection to this simplification, and, in fact, the author has supplied
the Hydrographer with a method of analysis of tidal observations extending over 29
days, in which the multipliers for both daily and hourly processes are +1.

10.3. The instructions by Dr. Hessen,* however, imply that only one out of the
two possible sets of 24 hourly sums is evaluated except when known conjugate con-
stituents with equal and opposite values of 9 necessitate both.
