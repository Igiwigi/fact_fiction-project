counterclockwise. Though this idea is straightforward in principle, great care must be taken in
choosing a suitable path C so that the integral can be closely estimated. To determine a ‘good’
path, one must first consider the location of the poles of P(q). Again, this is furnished by Euler’s
product formula (1.1), which shows that the poles lie exactly at the roots of unity. This justifies
the earlier claim that we may take any path which does not cross this wall of singularities, and
gives a first indication of how to estimate this integral. We would like to split this up into a ‘main
term’ and an error term, and so it is important to study where most of the contribution of the
integral will come from. If we choose a path which approaches roots of unity quite closely, then
the majority of the integral will come from the parts of the path near these poles. However, not all
poles will contribute equally to the size of the integral. An analysis of the generating function P(q)
shows that ‘near’ primitive jth order roots of unity, the size is much smaller the larger j is. Thus,
the main contribution is from the pole at q = 1, secondary terms come from the pole at q = —1 and
the third order of contribution comes from the third order roots of unity. In fact, the explanation
of the terms in the expansion (1.2) is that the function Ej(1) is an approximation of the behaviour
of a suitable Cauchy integral near the primitive jth order roots of unity. As an illustration of this
numerical phenomenon, table 2 contains values of P(q) near roots of unity, where the columns
correspond to the different roots of unity ¢, and where the values of f in the rows correspond to
evaluating |P(¢ - e~')|.

The exact description of P(q) near roots of unity is afforded by the modular transformation
properties of the Dedekind-eta function, for which
