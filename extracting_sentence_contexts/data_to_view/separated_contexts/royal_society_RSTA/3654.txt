However, in other scenarios, the behaviour of the system changes qualitatively beyond DN
onset. For example, attempts to determine the location of wrinkles based on determining where [a
compression would occur ordinarily under-predict the wrinkle extent dramatically [14,16,17]. It 1&8
is now well known that to correctly predict the location of wrinkles it is necessary to account .
for the fact that wrinkling relaxes the compressive stress that caused instability in the first place
[18,19]—what is usually referred to as tension-field theory [20] or the relaxed energy approach
[21]. However, an understanding of how this stress relaxation affects the wrinkle wavelength has
only come more recently [15,22,23]. In particular, Cerda & Mahadevan [15] showed that tension
along the direction of the wrinkles gives rise to an effective ‘tensional’ stiffness, Ktens, that may be
substituted into (1.1) in place of K.
