(b) The quantum probabilistic approach

In the analogy between geometry and probability, quantum probability can be compared to non-

Euclidean geometries with the difference, however, that while in the case of geometry it was clear : =
since the beginning which of the Euclidean axioms were modified in the new models (basically : a
the parallel axiom), in the case of probability the new mathematical model has preceded the : 2
recognition of which of the axioms of classical probability is violated by it. The first step of the aes
quantum probabilistic approach has been to individuate this hidden axiom in the elementary 22
definition of conditional probability in terms of joint probabilities (Bayes formula). The term [4
hidden axiom is justified by the fact that in usual textbooks on probability Bayes formula is used as : *
the definition of conditional probability. However, if one tries to deduce this formula from model- : =
independent probabilistic assumptions (axioms) one realizes that it is equivalent to five different : S

axioms (see [18]) some of which are far from being self-evident.

In physics conditional probabilities have a model-independent meaning in the sense that the
conditioning event corresponds to preparation of the experiment and the conditioned event to
effective measurement. This is true also for incompatible events because preparations precede
measurement. However, for incompatible events joint probabilities have no meaning, so we
cannot use Bayes formula to define conditional probabilities. For two events it is always possible
to invert the procedure and use Bayes formula to define joint probabilities in terms of conditional
and marginals. But for three or more events, mathematical constraints arise. The same argument
