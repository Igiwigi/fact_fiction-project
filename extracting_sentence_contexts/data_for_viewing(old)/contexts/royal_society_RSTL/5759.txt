Taz essential oil procured by distillation of the rue plant with water, has already been
examined by several chemists. It was analysed many years ago by W1LL*, who deduced
Strom his analyses the expression C* 1 O*. But at that time far too little was known
eabout the oxygenated essential oils to permit of their accurate investigation. A more
innate series of experiments, made by GERHARDT in 1848F, led him to conclude that
Sil of rue consisted principally of the capric aldehyde, contaminated by a small quantity
©Sof some hydrocarbon. This view was considered to be confirmed by the production of
Scapric acid when the oil underwent oxidation by means of nitric acid. But the pro-
Bquction of an acid containing C® merely rendered it probable that the rue oil did not
Zcontain less than 20 equivalents of carbon ; it was no proof that it did not contain more.
S In fact, the action of nitric acid varies with its concentration.

5 Guided by ideas which need not now be detailed, 1 made in 1853 some experiments,
E with the intention of obtaining from oil of rue certain bodies of the capric series, but
they only served to convince me that the views then entertained regarding the consti-
= tution of the oil were erroneous. Some curious reactions were observed, but the expe-
& riments diverging into other channels have not, as yet, been renewed. Previous to
E recommencing them, it has been thought necessary to make a fresh examination of the
E oil; the results form the subject of this communication.
Z On examination of Gernanrpr's numbers, it will be found that, while two of his
2 analyses agree exactly with the formula C® H® O?, the vapour-density (5:83) excee >ds the
© theoretical number (5:398) to a degree much greater than can be accounted for by an
error of experiment; the number obtained being almost the correct value for the
