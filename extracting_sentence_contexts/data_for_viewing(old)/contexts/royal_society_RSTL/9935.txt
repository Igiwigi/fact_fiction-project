It will be seen that in the history of 80 many of what may be called natural rota-


EXPERIMENTS ON THE MIXED HERBAGE OF PERMANENT MEADOW, 293

tions, we can hardly fail to learn nob only much that is of interest in reference to the
growth of the mixed herbage of permanent grass land, but alsv something of the
relative positions of the different plants that are grown separately, in alternation with
one another, in the artificial rotations adopted on arable land.

The botanical results are, moreover, of much independent interest, both by the facts
which they already contribute, and by the incentive and direction they may give to
future research.

Lastly, the chemistry of the subject will be found to offer many points of interest,
in regardâ€”to the variation in the percentage composition of the produce according to the
manure applied, to the description of plants developed, and to the character of their
development ; to the availableness of the constituents artificially supplied, and to the
amount and limit of the natural resources of the s0il, both actually and compared with
the results obtained when individual species are grown in arable culture.

Tt will be readily understood that the record, and the discussion, of the agricultural,
the botanical, and the chemical history of about 20 plots, in 20 different seasons, mus
