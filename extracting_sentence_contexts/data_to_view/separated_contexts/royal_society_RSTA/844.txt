With the cells used and the
methods of standardization already described* the discrepancies between the scales
are unlikely to be comparable to the very large variations that occur—sometimes
with great rapidity—in daylight. Apart from the above considerations we must evidently define what we mean by
the illumination at a given point. The problem is complicated by the fact that we
have to deal with light travelling in many different directions, the angular distribution
varying greatly at different times. Thus with a uniform cloudy sky the light may be
approximately uniform over one hemisphere. In addition to this direct skylight
there will be some light reflected off the ground, possibly snow covered, or the water.
