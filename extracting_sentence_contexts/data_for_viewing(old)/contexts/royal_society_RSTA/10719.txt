where dv denotes the element of the normal to dS drawn outwards (7.e., into the
region of space where O is situated), and the expressions in square brackets [ ] are to
be formed, for each point of the surface, at the time ¢— 7/c, 7 being the distance of
the point of the surface from the point O,

This theorem was obtained by Kircnuorr* by an application of GREEN’s theoremt
to the function ¢ and an auxiliary function V, which satisties the equation (1) at all
points except O, and has the form
