This of course means that R becomes small outside the limits +s. The width of
the spectrum line will be of order s. Now the two integrals just quoted will give
irregularly sinuous time-curves, the average extent of a sinuosity being of order 1/s,
Thus, the varying simple vibration

will have entirely changed in amplitude and phase after a time of order 1/s. It
will therefore be impossible to produce sensible interference with time-differences of
more than 1/s. This is another aspect of the fact that for lines of width s (measured
in frequency), the maximum path-difference for interference is of order 1/s.

§ 62. We can look at the same matter from yet another point of view. We may
go back to the composition of the radiation from a gas. This we have seen to be
built up of finite trains of waves. For the moment, let us omit the Doppler effect
and take all the trains to be of the same period. In an interval during which only a
small proportion of molecules collide, the amplitude and phase of the composite
vibrations is but little altered. But after an interval comparable with the mean free
time of molecules, most of the molecules will have obtained new and independent
vibrations ; the composite motion will be entirely altered in amplitude and phase.
For the discharge tubes used by MicHE.son this time is of order 10° periods.
