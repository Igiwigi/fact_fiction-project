The WUI categorization scheme situates four community archetypes on a con-
tinuum that recognizes dynamic change in human community functioning.
We use results from the WUI classification scheme to outline key characteris-
tics associated with each archetype and results from recent case studies to
demonstrate the diversity across WUI communities. Differences among key
