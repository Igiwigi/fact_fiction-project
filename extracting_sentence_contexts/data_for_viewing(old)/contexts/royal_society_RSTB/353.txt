axis, the transverse section of which is a triangle with each of the three angles more
or less prolonged in equal measures. But in my fructification of Bowmanites the
transverse section of this axis is very broadly robust, instead of being drawn out into
three very long and slender radii. Not only so, but the extremity of each short arm is
very broadly truncated ; a form that hitherto has only been seen in my Bowmanites
Dawsoni. In fig. 19 the central triangle a is composed of a cluster of trachex
grouped in no special order, except that the central ones are larger than those
occupying the periphery of the triangle. In my fructification this central truncated
triangle constitutes the sole vascular axis, a fact easy of explanation. Referring
to my Memoir V., Plate 1, I have shown that in the very young twig of my Astero-
phyllites, fig. 1, this triangle constituted the only trachezal bundle, but as the vege-
tative twig grew in age and size, it developed exogenously zones of tracheze which
were successively added, investing the triangular centre, as in figs, 2, 3, and 4, resulting
in the conditions seen in Plate 2, figs. 9, 10, and 11 of the same memoir. The present
figure 19 is as nearly as possible in the condition of the figure 9 just referred to. Its
exogenously added trachez are arranged in equally regular radial and concentric lines;
the sizes of the individual trachez enlarging as they were successively superimposed
upon those previously developed. Portions of a layer of a cork-like cortex, ¢, are still
preserved. A similar layer is seen, not in the young twigs of my Asterophyllites 1 and 2,
but in the older ones 9, 10, and 11. It also appears in the middle of the cortex,
enclosed, between an inner and an outer parenchymatous zone in M. Renavtt’s
