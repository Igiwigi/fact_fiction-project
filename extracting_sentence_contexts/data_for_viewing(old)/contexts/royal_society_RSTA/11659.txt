secondary tin is much larger, while it has segregated into masses which compare in
size with the primary tin in the same section; it would seem, in fact, that in this
case a considerable proportion of the secondary tin had formed around the primary
tin present, or had coalesced with it. In this alloy, as in the 16 per cent. alloy, it
thus appears that the transformation which takes place at 149° C. involves the
rejection of tin from the solid solution.

In view of these facts, and of the data supplied by the cooling-curves, the nature of
the transformation in question may be considered, Three alternative explanations
suggest themselves, viz. :—

(a) That the recalescence is due to the formation—on cooling—of a compound
which only gradually dissociates on heating ;

(b) That the recalescence arises from the decomposition of a compound which exists
at higher temperatures, but which is only slowly formed on heating ; and

(c) That the transformation is a change in the solid solution from a 8 to an «
modification, the latter possessing a smaller solubility for tin than the
former.
