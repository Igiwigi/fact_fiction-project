And although there was realization of what we could
learn by comparing different protein folds, the suggestion that we could aspire to know nearly all of
these, through the success of the various genome sequencing projects and advances in structural techni-
ques and structure prediction algorithms, was yet to emerge as a potentially realistic goal. Perhaps the most remarkable fact, however, in the context of the 2000 meeting is that even a fairly
detailed examination of the proceedings of the 1994 meeting has revealed only a few scattered references
to the idea that ‘misfolding’ was a potentially important aspect of the process of protein folding. In addi-
tion, we found only one direct reference to the fact that diseases could be associated with aberrant
folding. The latter was in the paper presented by Oleg Ptitsyn, a true visionary in the field of protein
structure, whose death since the last meeting we also note with great sadness. These omissions to some
extent reflect the fact that issues such as these had not yet been described in the molecular detail we
required for the topics we selected for the 1994 meeting.
