One can say that, with ig
the birth of quantum theory, Hilbert’s sixth problem was split into three different questions:

(i) Axiomatize classical probability. 3
(ii) Axiomatize the new (quantum) probability. a
(iii) Clarify the connections between the two. Moreover, in the term ‘axiomatization’, used in the statement of the above-mentioned problems, =
one should distinguish two different meanings: a2)

(i) Description of the mathematical models. : s
(ii) Deduction of these models from physically meaningful axioms. [8

(a) Some historical preliminaries

It is a curious historical fact that the description of the mathematical model of the new (quantum)
probability achieved a satisfactory setting before the same was achieved by classical probability. In fact the first paper I know on the former problem is due to the physicist Jordan [4] and is almost
simultaneous with a joint paper of Hilbert himself, together with von Neumann and Nordheim
[5], which collected the notes of a Géttingen seminar (held in 1926) devoted to the description of
the mathematical structure of quantum theory. Dirac’s (1930) book [6] is the first one to describe the quantum mechanical formalism, but it
uses the language of distributions—a theory that at that time had not yet been mathematically
systematized and therefore created some diffidence in the mathematical community. Shortly
after it was followed by von Neumann’s (1932) monograph [7] which used the more established
language of Hilbert spaces and spectral theory and concentrated on the mathematical aspects,
leaving aside the more concrete physical applications.
