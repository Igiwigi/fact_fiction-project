without taking food, to prepare for this change,â€”the third period of its embryo life.
It is then to prepare for this last change that it now lies perfectly quiet, absolute rest,
being necessary to its proper evolution, which may probably be retarded by the
slightest disturbance.

The lower portion of the alimentary canal is now distinetly visible through the new
segments. When examined by transmitted light, it exhibits a corrugated or folded
appearance, being folded to allow of its 8udden extension at the period of throwing off
the skin, and elongation of the segments. The colon is of a very dark colour, and ex-
hibits its thickened peculiar structure, with its longitudinal muscular bands. Around
its posterior part I observed an aggregation of what appeared to be globular cells.
They seemed to be part of the organs of generation in the course of development. At.
first I regarded them as hepatic vessels, but this could hardly be the case, from the fact
that each of these organs directly enters the canal as a straight vessel ; but they might
be vessels folded up to be unfolded suddenly, as in the case of the alimentary canal.

On the twenty-second day (fig. 15.) but little further advance is made in the deve-
lopment of the animal, save only that the original segments more distinetly exhibit
the appearance of the segments of the perfect Myriapod. This appearance was more
distinet than on the previous day, and consisted of transverse markings that divided
each segment into two parts, the posterior of which was now impressed with longitn-
dinal strizz. From the length of the posterior portion of each segment being slightly
$horter than the anterior, it is evident that the segments had not yet acquired their
fullest development, although they were more advanced than on the previous day.
The dark patch of colour on the sides of the seventh segment, which first began to
