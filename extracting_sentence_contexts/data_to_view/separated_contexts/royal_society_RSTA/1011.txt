If we
exclude the local non-equilibrium effect of the relaxation of the gradient flow, ie. tg > 0 and
Vg > 00 in equations (4.7) and (4.8), the square root will yield unity in equation (4.5) and we get
the velocity as plotted by the dotted line in figure 4. More specifically, it is shown in the insert of
figure 4 how the predicted velocity lies far from the experimental data if the local non-equilibrium
effect in the phase field dynamics is not taken into account. The necessity to introduce the gradient flow of the phase field as an additional thermodynamic
variable (see appendix B) lies in the fact that with the increase of undercooling in glass-forming
alloy one can find a transition from single atoms and single clusters to chains of connected clusters
(see data of molecular dynamics simulations in [64]). Such chains represent long molecules
