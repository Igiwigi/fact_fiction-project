to assume that eigensubspaces have equal dimension. The operator © is represented with the .
aid of the projectors onto eigensubspaces corresponding to its eigenvalues: © = @wiwEwiw +
@nwiwEnwiw: Then the probability of the event water invasion into the oil well is given by the
formula

Pwiw = jim pwiw(t) = jim Tr o(t)Ewiw.

Of course, an expert has to finish estimation of the probability of the event WIW in finite time.
She cannot wait until all fluctuations die. Therefore the approximation for sufficiently large T is
used: pwiw © pwiw(T).

Such T is determined from the condition of diminishing fluctuations of the matrix elements (in
fact, fluctuations of the probability pwiw(t). We remark that figures 3-6 represent only the rough
picture of the behaviour of matrix elements. By using a finer time scale, we would see a variety of
small spikes on the basic curves of these figures).

6. Conclusion

We presented a model of dynamical PRA for the exploration and management of hydrocarbon
reservoirs based on the theory of open quantum systems. This model can serve as the theoretical
base for the creation of an automatic system for decision-making. We set the conceptual
foundations for the development of such a system for the continuous update of the belief state
of an expert. Of course, its concrete realization is a complex problem (derivation of the proper
quantum master equations).
