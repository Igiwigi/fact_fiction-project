As judged by BFs, only one fossil exhibited strong evi-
dence (i.e. log BF <— 3.0) that the phylogenetic estimate of
fossil age was inconsistent with the geological age range. The log BF for Paraptenodytes antarcticus was —3.4. In fact,

Figure 2. The Bayesian phylogenetic estimate of fossil age (median of marginal posterior) for each of the 36 penguin fossils plotted against their palaeontological
age estimates, under two alternative site and molecular clock models. The palaeontological age estimates are represented by the mid-point of the range and the
upper and lower limits.
