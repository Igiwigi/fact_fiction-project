It is well known that the Newlands-Mendeleev classification of the elements was preceded
by the discoveries of certain numerical relations between the atomic weights of allied
elements due to Débereiner, Dumas and others; but what has been almost completely
ignored is the immense advance made by M.A. E. Béguyer de Chancourtois, a French
geologist of note... [12, p. 186]

Hartog went on to give a detailed translation of numerous passages from de Chancourtois’
articles and concluded by saying

It will be well to point out immediately that M. de Chancourtois’s system assigns numerical
characteristics of the elements a general formula of the form (n+ 16n’) where n’ is
necessarily an integer; and his table thus brings out the fact that the differences between
the atomic weights of allied bodies approximate in many cases to multiples of 16. Thus we
get the parallel series of which our author speaks —

Li Na K Mn Rb
7... 7+16=23 ... 74+216=39 ... 7+3.16=55 ... 7+5.16=87
oO S Se Te

16... 164+16=32 ... 164+416=80 ... 16+7.16=128

2De Chancourtois did not cite Cannizzaro by name and some of his atomic weights were slightly different. For a detailed
comparison of the atomic weights used by Cannizzaro and De Chancourtois see Van Spronsen [19].
