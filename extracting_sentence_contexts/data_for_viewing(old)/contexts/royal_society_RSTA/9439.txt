(With Messrs. Hammron Davies and H. H. Gray.)

The observations made during the preceding experiments that there is no
deposition whatever of carbon when mixtures of composition intermediate between
3CH,+20, and CH,+0, are exploded under pressure, opened up the possibility of
comparing the relative affinities of methane and hydrogen for oxygen under the
conditions of homogeneous flame combustion, in the manner hereinafter to be
described.

The theoretical importance of such a comparison is enhanced by the fact that it
provides not only a basis for the discussion of the question whether or not the known
rates of flame propagation through explosive mixtures of different combustible gases
are governed by their relative affinities for oxygen, but also affords decisive evidence
as to the mode of combustion of hydrogen in explosions.

Ever since Sir Humpurey Davy’s
hydrogen has been considered superior
not only is the ignition tem
than that of methane (650°

experiments on flame, the combustibility of
to that of methane, and, as a matter of fact,
