passage of solutes or periplasmic proteins. In its active form, the translocation pore transits from
an elongated kidney shape to a more round conformation (figure 3) and the plug domain swings
out of the pore lumen into the periplasm close to the NTD to allow translocation of the pilus
subunits. This transition from an closed/inactive to an open/active state of the usher is triggered
by the recruitment of the first chaperone-subunit complex to the usher (the chaperone-adhesin
complexes FimC-FimH in type 1 pili and PapD-PapG in P pili) [43]. Exactly how this recruitment
induces pore opening or other conformational changes affecting the various usher domains is
still unclear.

(a) The N-terminal domainâ€™s role: subunit recruitment

The usher N-terminal domain (NTD) is the initial recruitment site of chaperone-subunit
complexes, a fact confirmed when it was observed that a bulky molecule reacted to the NTD
could inhibit pilus elongation in vitro [43-45]. In addition, the NTD alone has by far the highest
affinity for chaperone-subunit complexes [40,46,47], consistent with the NTD being the initial
recruitment site.

Previously, only chaperone-subunit complexes were found to bind to the usher, not the free
chaperone [48,49]. Because the usher almost exclusively interacts with the chaperone of the
chaperone-subunit complex [45,50], recruitment of solely a chaperone without its subunit cargo
is avoided by a so-called proline lock within the usher binding surface (UBS) of the chaperone:
the structure of a chaperone without cargo shows a pair of conserved proline residues at the
beginning of the subunit-binding F;G; loop that occlude the usher-binding surface and prevent
the usher from binding. In a chaperone-subunit complex, the proline lock rotates away from the
usher-binding surface, allowing the usher-chaperone-subunit complex to form [34].
