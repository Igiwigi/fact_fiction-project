istence of a relation in the transpirability of different gases, of an equally simple
nature as that which is recognised among the specific gravities of gases, or even as
the still more simple ratios of their combining volumes. Compared with solids and
liquids, matter in the form of gas is susceptible of small variation in physical pro-
perties, and exhibits only a few grand features. 'These differences of property which
are preserved amidst the prevailing uniformity of gases, may well be supposed to be
among the most deep-seated and fundamental in their nature with which matter is
endowed. It was under such impressions that I have devoted an amount of time
and attention to the determination of this class of numerical constants, which might
otherwise appear disproportionate to their value and the importance of the subject.
As the results, too, were entirely novel, and wholly unprovided for in the received
view of the gaseous constitution, of which indeed they prove the incompleteness, it
was the more necessary to verify eyery fact with the greatest care.

Perhaps the most general and simple result which I can offer is, that the transpira-
tion velocity of hydrogen is exactly double that of nitrogen. These gases it will be
remembered have a less simple relation in density, namely 1 to 14. This was the
conclusion respecting the transpiration of these gases in my former paper, and I have
obtained since much new evidence in its favour. The transpirability of carbonic
oxide, like the specific gravity of that gas, appears also to be identical with that of
nitrogen.

The result which I would place next in point of accuracy and importance is, that the
transpiration velocity of oxygen is related to that of nitrogen in the inverse ratio of
the densities of these gases, that is as 14 to 16. In equal times it is not equal volumes
