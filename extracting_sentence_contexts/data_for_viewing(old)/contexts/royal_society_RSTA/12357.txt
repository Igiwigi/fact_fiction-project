Istria, and there are large accumulations of red drift and loam filling cavities in the
neighbourhood of Trieste ; but without further details it is not possible to judge with
certainty of the exact relations of these deposits. So far as known to me, the
explanation I have suggested in the other cases might possibly apply to these
districts, but the great height of the ground, and the peculiar local conditions, render
further investigation necessary.

Dalmatia.—The travels of ALBERTO Forts in Dalmatia* furnish some incidental
notices of the ossiferous breccia on the Adriatic coast, and especially on the islands of ~
Charso and Ossero, which consist of ranges of limestone hills of some height either
bare or covered by red earth. The cliffs on the coast are traversed by numerous
fissures filled with breccia, and containing, Forris says, an extraordinary abundance
of bones, but beyond these facts there is no reliable statement as to the character and
nature of the bones or breccia.

Dr. F. Lanza,t who visited this coast long subsequently, adds little to our informa-
tion, except that some of the bones belong to a species of Deer, and that the breccia
contains land, but no marine, shells. These instances, however, help to show the
generality and common characters of the phenomena over all this area.

Ionian Islands.—Except a few incidental notices by ANsTED{ and SrrRIcKLAND,§
such as that the valley of Signies in Cephalonia is covered by an alluvium full of
angular flints, I can find no mention of anything referable to a Rubble-drift.

Tam unable to extend this inquiry through central and south-eastern Europe, as
