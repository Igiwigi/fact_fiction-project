Undeterred, Joule ploughed on. This time he investigated the changes in temperature

produced by the expansion and compression of air. The experiments were carried out with two : 8
cylinders joined via a stopcock. One side was pressurized and the cylinders were placed in a Dos
water bath. When the valve was opened there was no change in the water temperature (because :=
no overall work was done and the internal energy of the air remained the same) but further : Sy
measurements showed that the cylinder subject to the expansion was cooled while that subject 2
to the compression was heated by almost exactly the same amount. The experiments gave values aed
for J of 820, 814 and 760 foot-pounds per Btu. 22
The paper [10] ended with the following bold statement: : xs
The principles I have adopted lead to a theory of the steam-engine very different from 72

the one generally received, but at the same time much more accordant with facts. It is : 8

the opinion of many philosophers that the mechanical power of the steam-engine arises
simply from the passage of heat from a hot to a cold body, no heat being necessarily lost
during the transfer. This view has been adopted by Mr. E. Clapeyron.... This philosopher
agrees with Mr. Carnot in referring the power to vis viva developed by the caloric contained
by the vapour, in its passage from the temperature of the boiler to that of the condenser.
I conceive that this theory, however ingenious, is opposed to the recognised principles
of philosophy, because it leads to the conclusion that vis viva may be destroyed by an
improper disposition of the apparatus. ... Believing that the power to destroy belongs to
the Creator alone I entirely coincide with Roget and Faraday in the opinion that any theory
