In
advocated here to suggest that it meant that every order to help with the endeavour of creating a
individual organism in an ecosystem needed to be modern systems ecology, there are techniques and
included in a model of that ecosystem in order to approaches that already exist in other fields and
make useful predictions about it. Not only would which can be applied to ecological systems [46]. If
such a naive exercise be extremely difficult to construct we wish to consider the creation of an ecological par-

and parametrize, but also it would be almost imposs- allel to bioinformatics, then we will need to create
ible to comprehend and would probably exceed the new tools and approaches to allow us to cope with
ability of even modern computers to run the compu- the fact that ecology has different constraints and

tations [10]. One challenge for a modern formulation advantages to molecular systems biology [48]. Further
of systems ecology will be to create models of the developing systems ecology to a point where it can
‘appropriate’ complexity.
