Thus, in
the masterly experiment of Mr. TENNANT, phosphorus, which
attracts oxygen less strongly than charcoal, by the intermedia-
tion of lime decomposes the, carbonic acid. Yet, led by the
analogy of this fact, its discoverer found that a similar artifice
did not succeed in decomposing the muriatic acid, * As vital
© air,” he observes, © is attracted by a compound of phosphorus
© and calcareous earth, more powerfully than by charcoal, I was
« desirous of trying their efficacy upon those acids which may
* from analogy be supposed to contain vital air, but which are
* not affected by the application of charcoal, With this intention,
* I made phosphorus pass/ through a compound of marine acid

« and calcareous earth, and also of fluor acid and calcareous
« earth, but without producing in either of them any alteration.
« Since the strong attraction which these acids have for calca-
« reous earth tends to prevent their decomposition, it might be
« thought, that in this manner they were not more disposed' to
« part with. vital air- than by the attraction of charcoal : but
« this, however, does: not appear to be the fact. I have found,
« that phosphorus cannot be obtained by passing marine acid
« through a compound of bones and charcoal when red-hot.
« The attraction, therefore, of phosphorus and lime for vital
« air, exceeds the attraction of charcoal, by a greater force than
« that arising from the attraction of marine acid for lime,” *

By means similar to those employed in attempting the
analysis of the muriatic acid, I tried to effect that of the fluoric
acid, When electrified alone, in a glass tube coated internally
with wax, it sustained a. diminution of bulk, and there remained
a. portion of hydrogenous gas.
