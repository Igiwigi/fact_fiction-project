uptake in oligotrophic regions have generally failed to identify rates that could lead to the order
of magnitude of O2 accumulation observed and export estimates reported.

There are several potential explanations for the disagreement between direct measurements
of photosynthetic rate and indirect estimates of seasonal new or export production rates in
permanently stratified oligotrophic regions. Firstly, direct measurement of photosynthesis is
made on small samples taken at discrete depths. Usually the depth/depths for determining
photosynthesis rates are selected from surface waters and taken at fixed depths or levels of light
penetration. Such sampling strategies do not necessarily include sampling at the depth of the
deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) which is consistently found in the deepest part of the euphotic
zone, i.e. at depths below 100 m, in the Sargasso and other oligotrophic ocean areas.

Despite the fact that these DCM are found at the base of the euphotic zone and thus experience
low ambient light intensities, there have been reports that photosynthesis at the DCM can
contribute substantially to water column production in the Sargasso Sea [5,11]. °N and isotope
analyses in surface waters in the Sargasso Sea suggest that nitrogen fixation (diazotrophy) is

‘New production [6,7] is defined as photosynthesis based on an allochthanous nitrogen source. Only new production can lead
to a net increase in organic material in the system and an accumulation of Oz, The f-ratio [7] refers to the percentage of
new production occurring, i.e. new/total PP. Most new production will ultimately be exported from the system in which
it is generated, i.e. Export production and Export ratio (e-ratio) represents export/total PP. At steady state, then, e-ratio
becomes f-ratio.
