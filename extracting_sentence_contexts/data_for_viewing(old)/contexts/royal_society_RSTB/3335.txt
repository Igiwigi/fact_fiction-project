RatHKeE also describes a pair of blood-vessels corresponding in position to the
sinus cavernosi of man and extending from the optic foramina to the internal carotid
foramina. I have found no such vessels or sinuses in Sphenodon.

We may summarise the results of our comparison of the cerebral arteries and veins
of Sphenodon with those of other reptiles as follows: On the whole the arrangement
agrees with that of the Lacertilia, so far as these have been investigated, but there
is an important difference in the fact that the vena cephalica posterior leaves the
cranial cavity through the foramen jugulare and not through the foramen magnum,
while a slightly more primitive condition is shown in the less completely united
condition of the basilar artery. Sphenodon makes some approach to the condition ot
the Chelonia in this latter respect, but differs conspicuously from this group in the
fact that the circle of Willis is not completed anteriorly, as well as in the fact that
no branch of the posterior cephalic vein leaves the cranial cavity through the
foramen magnum. A very characteristic feature of Sphenodon is the development
of large transverse sinuses resembling those of the crocodile, but these communicate
with the extracranial vascular system in quite a different manner from that described
by Ratuke in the latter animal.
