If we turn now to the method of physiological experiment, there is hardly any
subject in the whole realm of physiology upon which such divergence of experimental

result and interpretation exists as that of the relations between the columns of the
cord and the passage of afferent impulses. The contradictory facts set forth in the various papers on this subject are sufficient
to justify the belief that many of the experiments made must have involved the

. presence of some factor of capricious character and uncertain action, common to most

of them, and that the conclusions which the various experimentalists have drawn from
their results are all vitiated by its presence. When such a fundamental matter as that of the extent to which the afferent path
lies on one or the other side of the cord is answered so differently that, according to

A one set of investigators (BRowNn-SiquaRp, Ferrier, &c.), it is wholly crossed ;

according to others chiefly crossed (WoroscHILoFF, MiEscHER, &c.); equally uncrossed

and crossed (vAN DrzEn, Stitiine, &c.); chiefly uncrossed (von Brzoip, Mort); wholly

uncrossed (CHAUVEAU); it is plain that the method adopted is at fault and is quite

A inefficient for the purpose of determining the extent to which particular tracts in the _

cord are concerned with the passage of impulses.
