of interradial plates in Asterina developed round the right body-cavity at first forms
a horseshoe-shaped curve, open towards the preoral lobe, just like the basals of
Antedon, to which they correspond.

It might have been expected that the change in the orientation of the Crinoid larva
would seriously affect the question of homologies of the plates of the Crinoidal calyx ;
but, as a matter of fact, owing to Gérrn’s somewhat fortunate mistake, this is not the
case, and P, H. Carpenter’s arguments derived from the development of the basals
and orals round the right and left body-cavities respectively remain unaltered (7).


294 MR. H. BURY ON THE EARLY STAGES IN THE .
The only new piece of evidence which my observations afford on this point is the fact .
that at the time of its earliest development the water-pore has no connection with
any of the skeletal plates ; so that in this point too Antedon resembles other Echino- —
derms. In fact it seems probable that this and the other external openings (mouth
and anus) of the Echinoderms opened primitively in or near the median line, along
which ran the mesentery separating the right and left body-cavities ; and that at the
time the different groups of Echinoderms separated from one another the mouth
alone had departed from this position, and had taken up a definite station in the
centre of the left side. The water-pore, which may have been from the first slightly
on the left side, subsequently worked its way, in some groups (Crinoids and Ophiurids)
on to the oral, in others (Echinids and Asterids) on to the aboral, side; so |
that, although its interradius probably remains the same, its position with regard
to the calcareous plates is secondary. The anus, on the other hand, had already
