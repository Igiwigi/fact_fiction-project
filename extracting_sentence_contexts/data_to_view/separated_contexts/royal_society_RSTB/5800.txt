Plates 38 and 39 show some of them. There are several striking points in these
photographs. On the convexity the following facts may be noted In the brachycephalic brains the
angle between the Sylvia and the lateral horizontal (Sylvian angle) is larger than in
dolicho- or meso-cephalic brains. This is correlated with a greater depth of the temporal
lobe and this again with a somewhat more pronounced tendency of the superior temporal
convolution to be curved and to protrude in front of the Sylvian line. Furthermore, the
fissurets representing the inferior temporal show a prevailing transverse arrangement.
