Before I go farther, T muſt ſpeak one 'word more of
that particular quality of conduCting bodies, by which
they receive, with a kind of reluftance, either /ſtate of
electricity; and, after having received it, part with the
fame with as much ſeeming difficulty. This quality, not
unknown to attentive electricians, who muſt /have ob=
ſerved it, has commonly appeared ſomewhat extraordi-
nary and difficult to be believed by many ele&tricians, to

whoml have happened to explain my theory of the elec«
trophore. As this quality is the foundation of this theory,

I conceive it will not'be amiſs'to demonſtrate jt by facts,
The firſt part of this inherent quality of non-con-
dufting bodies, receiving a fſtate'of electricity with more
difficulty than conduting bodies, is eaſily ſhewn by the
following ſimple experiment; apiece of dry glaſs, held

near a prime conductor, will receive no eleQricity, or al-
moſt none, at the ſame diſtance as that at which a piece of
metal or another condufting ſubſtance will have received
a conſiderable degree of electricity, or even a full ſpark. The ſecond part of this inherent quality may be thus
demonſtrated: a piece of metal inſulated, as, for inſtance,
the mietal plate of an electrophore; placed upon the cake
of reſin excited with a conſiderable degree of electricity,
will not receive any eledricity at all, or only a faint one,
when it is ſeparated from the cake without having been
touched when it was in conta&t with the cake, or in the
ſphere of action of the cake, though it was really in a
ſtate of anal electricity all the time it was upon the
plate. Now, if the cake of reſin did part as eaſily with
its ſtate of electricity as the metal plate, it would leave
a-confiderable degree of elecricity upon the metal plate;
