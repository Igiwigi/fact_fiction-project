the 2013/2014 breeding season. First, the summer was unu-
sually warm leading to periods of rain that, combined with
subsequent snow-melt, posed significant thermal challenges
to drenched young chicks adapted to the typically cold and
dry conditions of the region. Compounding these increased
thermal challenges, uncharacteristically low wind speeds at
the colony failed to disperse sea-ice cover, which increased
the distance parents had to travel to forage at sea dramatically.
This decrease in resource availability ultimately led to less
chick provisioning. The combined result of these two events
was complete reproductive failure of the colonyâ€”which may
have significant future consequences for the population as
well as the local ecosystem [28]. This case highlights the fact
that to us, seemingly positive environmental changes such as
increased temperature and decreased wind speed may in com-
bination constitute an extreme event for a species adapted to a
polar environment. Further, it illustrates the need to integrate
climatic and biological definitions when assessing whether

an extreme event has occurred. 8. A new take on the biological-based approach
