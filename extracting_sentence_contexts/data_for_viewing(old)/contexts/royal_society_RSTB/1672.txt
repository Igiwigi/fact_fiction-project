small inspirations, usually at long intervals. Very often these inspirations were of a
sighing character, and consequently the tracings frequently exhibited two or three
apices on each respiratory movement. The movements gradually deepened in extent
and increased in frequency.

If the recovery took place during the execution of artificial respiration, the natural
respiratory movements occurred between the artificial ones.

Very commonly at the commencement of the recovery, and occasionally also as the
respiratory centre died, the phenomenon of shallow respirations alternating with deep
ones was observed.

After the fact of variability in depth, alteration in regularity of the rhythm is
the next most important factor. This was well exemplified in Experiments 9, 22, 32,
where it was seen that both the recovery and failure of the respiratory centre was
accompanied by great irregularity in the rhythm of its discharge.

That the recovery of the respiratory centre is complete under the circumstances
just detailed, was tested by us in two ways, (1) by inducing asphyxia, (2) by dividing
the vagi.

(1.) Upon clamping the trachea the expiratory convulsive respiratory movements
which followed were in every respect characteristic of the usual disturbance of the
respiratory centre effected by asphyxia.
