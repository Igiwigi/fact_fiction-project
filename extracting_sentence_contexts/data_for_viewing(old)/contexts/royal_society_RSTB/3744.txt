There are two very distinct sutures traversing the cranial axis (text-figs. 4 and 5,
and Plate 17, fig. 1), and at first sight it would, perhaps, be natural to suppose
that these sutures divide the basioccipital from the basisphenoid and the basisphenoid

from the presphenoid, but on examining the relations of the bones more closely it
becomes clear that the more posterior suture lies between the basioccipital in front
and below, and the exoccipital behind and above, and that, in fact, the two
exoccipital bones meet each other in the middle line, and form the dorsal and
larger part of the condyle, while the basioccipital forms the lower part. The meeting
of the exoccipitals across the middle line is cited by Grecory* as occurring in
Cynodonts, and as one of their primitive reptilian characters.

The more anterior suture lies between the basioccipital and the basisphenoid in the
neighbourhood of the sagittal plane (text-fig. 4, Section 77); in the more lateral
sections, where the pro-otic rests on the basioccipital, the suture lies between the
basisphenoid on the one side and the basioccipital, plus the pro-otic, on the other
(text-fig. 4, Sections 85 to 93), The course of the suture as seen in a vertical section
is oblique. The basioccipital is deeply grooved on the ventral surface, or to express
the same fact otherwise, its ventral surface is produced downwards on each side to
