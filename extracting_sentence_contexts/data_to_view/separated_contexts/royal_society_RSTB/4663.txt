B, Squatina squatina, ripe embryo,
264 mm. long, caudal vertebra, from region of first dorsal fin, x 14. (For explanation of the lettering,
see p. 404.)

It has already been pointed out that in young specimens of Cetorhinus the calcified
lamellz in the intermedialia are concentric. Hass shows this in the caudal vertebrae
(15, D, Plate 32, figs. 3 and 4); in fig. 13, A, above, it is demonstrated in a trunk
vertebra. Allusion has also been made (p. 316) to the fact that for indicating
taxonomic relationship the hind caudal vertebre of the adult are in this genus more
reliable than the trunk and anterior caudal vertebrae of the young; fig. 14, C, is
recognisable as Lamnoid in character, but fig. 13, A, is peculiar. It will be noticed,
further, how, in passing backward from the root of the caudal fin (fig. 14, A, B, C),
the concentric laminze dwindle and the radially disposed parts become relatively more
important. The wedge-faces, usually the first parts to undergo calcification, here calcify late.
