'This new
erosion passed through both the basalt and subjacent tuff, with or without the inter-
vention of the ancient river-bed, according as the new water-course corresponded with or
deviated from the older one. Lastly, the lava of the year 1284, called the © Sciara di
ſemina morta,” flowed, as will be seen by the Map, Plate XLIX, from the Val del Boye
west of Milo, and then north of Ballo to La Macchia, entering the modern channel of
the torrent below that town, and is now in its turn cut through by the torrent, as I saw
when 1 revisited the section in 1858. From this last fact I infer, that as this medizeyal
lava came down to this point from the Val del Bove, s0 many of the antecedent floods
of melted matter, and among them the basaltic current above alluded to, was derived
from that region. 'They would naturally all follow the lowest levels of the then existing
surface of the country, just as the waters draining the eastern slopes of Etna have done. For this reason the older lava filled the old river-bed, and afterwards the newer lava of
1284 reached the existing river-channel.
