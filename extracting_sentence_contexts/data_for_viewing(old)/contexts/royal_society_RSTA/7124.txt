Thus it can be seen that of all the stable intermediate products of reaction formed in the
‘end-gas’ of the engine prior to knock organic peroxides (and hydrogen peroxide) are the
only ones which have a strong pro-knock action. Their effect implies that auto-catalysis,
due to peroxide formation, of the reactions concerned in knock occurs.


‘KNOCK’ IN THE SPARK-IGNITION ENGINE 483

Of the various products known to be formed in the ‘end-gas’ of an engine, formaldehyde
is the only one which, in small quantities, has an appreciable anti-knock action. Olefins
and inert gases are known to have anti-knock effects, but only when added in comparatively
large quantities. The effect of formaldehyde means that a considerable selfinhibition of
the reactions leading to knock occurs and, together with the facts concerning organic
peroxides, shows that the two products whose actions particularly yield keys to an under-
standing of knock reactions are formaldehyde and organic peroxides. It is for this reason
that the sampling investigation has been largely concentrated on their estimation.

The cylinder charge consists of carburetted fuel/air mixture plus a variable amount of
unscavenged exhaust gas. This latter will be responsible for the presence of CO, CO,;
NO, NO,; H,O, SO,, SO, (if the fuel contains sulphur, as it usually does); and, in some
cases, HCHO and H,. Of these gases only NO, and SO, would be expected to affect
