The two values rarely differed by more
than 0-003 mm., and their mean was adopted in subsequent reduction. In all,
twelve settings were made on each line, except in the case of some of the faintest lines
which were not visible on all the plates; these exceptions have been noted in the
tables given. The reduction of micrometer readings to wave-lengths was simplified by the fact that
the dispersion was almost exactly 10 A per millimetre. In the region 16560-24860
the readings were reduced to approximate wave-lengths by the addition of a constant,
and the final adjustment was made from an error curve drawn either by means of the
iron standards or the Hydrogen standards prepared from them. In the blue and ultra-
violet regions a preliminary linear correction was applied so as to reduce the slope of
the error curve.
