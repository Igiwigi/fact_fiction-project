So, assuming the initial monopole mass to be around 1 TeV, we may conclude that the universe
needs to consume only a tiny fraction (about 0.025%) of the total energy to produce the
monopoles. This ensures that the electroweak monopole production does not alter the standard
cosmology.

In fact, we can say that even (9.5) is an overestimation. The reason is that, as we will see soon,
the monopole-antimonopole capture radius becomes much bigger the correlation length &;, so
that most of the monopoles annihilate with the antimonopoles as soon as they are produced.

10. Cosmic evolution of electroweak monopole

After they are produced the monopoles can not decay because they are topologically stable.
But there are two factors which change the initial monopole density, the Hubble expansion
and the annihilation of monopoleâ€”-antimonopole pairs. So the change of monopole density 1
is determined by the Boltzmann equation [38,40]
