In particular, in the absence of the nonlinear terms, the quadratic potential
yields all average market prices to be zero and is clearly quite useless for analysing market prices. We show below that the values of the nonlinear terms are 10 times greater than the error
terms, clearly showing that the value of the nonlinear terms is a defining feature of market prices. To check the consistency of the evaluation of the nonlinear terms using Feynman diagrams, a
numerical simulation has been carried out in [2] to confirm that the range of the nonlinear terms
obtained from the market data can in fact be obtained using the Feynman perturbation expansion. The action is written in terms of the scaled variable y(t) and we obtain
