thing approaching a precise expression of the chemical changes which gunpowder of
average composition undergoes when exploded in a confined space, we feel warranted
by the results of our experiments in stating, with confidence, that the chemical theory
of the decomposition of gunpowder, as based upon the results of BuxsEx and Scuscn-
KOFF, and accepted in recent text-books, is certainly as far from correctly representing
the general metamorphosis of gunpowder as was. the old and long-accepted theory,
according to which the primary products were simply potassium sulphide, carbonic
anhydride, and nitrogen.

Moreover the following broad facts regarding the products furnished by the explo-

X sion of gunpowder appear to us to haye been establighed by the analytical results
S given in this paper.

E which the saltpetre and charcoal exist in proportions calculated, according to the old
= theory, to produce carbonic anhydride only, is much more considerable than hitherto
