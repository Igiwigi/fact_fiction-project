Part XI.â€”On citromycetin, a new yellow colouring matter produced from glucose by species
of Citromyces.

By Arruur CLEMENT HETHERINGTON and Haroitp RalstTRIcK.

The genus Citromyces WEHMER comprises a number of species which were considered
by Weumer to be unique in the fact that they produce considerable quantities of citric
acid by the fermentation of sugar. Because of this, WEHMER gave to the genus the
name of Citromyces. The genus is closely related to Penicillium and Aspergillus, and
has in fact been dropped by THom in his recent book on the genus Penicillium (1929).
Txom prefers to regard all species previously regarded as Citromyces, as species of
Penicillium (see Part IV).

Physiologically the genus Citromyces was considered to be distinguished from other
genera by the production of citric acid, but more recent work has shown that not only
is the production of citric acid a fairly common characteristic of other genera, particularly
of Aspergillus and Penicillium, but that, quantitatively, certain species which are not
Citromyces give much larger yields of citric acid.
