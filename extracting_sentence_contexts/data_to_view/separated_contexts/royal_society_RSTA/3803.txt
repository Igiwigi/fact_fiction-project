It is usually more convenient to define the Poincaré sphere using the Stokes parameters:

So=l |Exl? + |Eyl” E*.o9-E,
$1 =Ip: — 1902 =|Exl*—|Eyl? = E*-03-E, eo.)
2.1
S2 = las: — ligase = EXEy + ExEy E*-o1-E
and $3 =IRH — In = —i(E{Ey — ExEy) =E*-02-E. The first column of equalities indicates how the Stokes parameters can be found by intensity
measurements, with polarizer at the angle given in the subscript (0°, 90°, 45°, 135° and RH, LH
circular polarizations). The second column gives the Stokes parameters in terms of components
of E, which in fact are complex inner products of E with the Pauli spin matrices o9 =(}9),
o1=(9)), o2= (? me) and o3=() °,); the subscripts on the $; agree with the subscripts on
a; in the circular basis. They satisfy S} + $3 + $3 =$}, so we can define the normalized Stokes
vector s = (s1,$,83), where s; = S;/So, i=1,2,3, and all possible choices of s define a unit sphere. Multiplying E by a complex phase factor (representing, for instance, the evolution of time) does
not change s.
