B. POULTON ON THE COLOUR-RELATION BETWEEN EXPOSED

space between the larva and the perforation in the lower disc, but this was largely
blocked by the larval bristles. The different sizes of the openings through which the
compartments were illuminated corresponded to the fact that the light which came
down from the window into the upper compartment was far stronger than that which
was veflected up into the lower chamber (the glass sheet with the tubes adhering
being placed a short distance above an ordinary plain deal table), In order to apply
the tubes, the larvae were induced to suspend themselves from sheets of glass. A
number of strips of glass were cut of various lengths, and equal, but narrow, widths
(about 4 centimetres), and these were placed together so as to form a number of
separate rectangular frames, the angles being secured with gummed paper, a sheet of
glass being placed as a roof over the top of each. In this way a number of glass boxes
were obtained, having very low sides (4 centimetres), and very large covers.
