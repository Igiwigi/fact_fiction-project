The effect of stirring up dust is to increase the ratio. The bacteria are increased,
while the moulds are little affected. Thus, in the High School the micro-organisms were
determined just before and just after the boys had raised a cloud of dust by stamping
on the floor. Before stamping, 10 bacteria and 1 mould were found ; after stamping,
150 bacteria and 0 moulds. Again, - one of the wards in the Infirmary, where the
beds had just been made, te ratio was 44, while the next highest ratio observed in
any of the other wards was 3. No dust ‘Wad been raised in any of the latter wards,
except what was due to es movements about the wards,

Relative lightness of moulds and bacteria.—The ratio of bacteria to moulds is
considerably affected if the air remains quiet for any length of time, as the bacteria
(or rather the particles to which they are attached), as a rule, settle out much more
rapidly than moulds. In fact, the moulds settle out so slowly that we have never
noticed the effects of their subsidence in the course of our observations.

The relative lightness of moulds as compared with the particles to which bacteria are
attached has already been observed by Hesse (‘Mitth. a. d. K. Gesundheitsamte,’ vol. 2,
p. 186), who found that moulds, as a rule, penetrate much further into the tubes
before settling down on the jelly than bacteria do. He gives many measurements of

their actual distance. Our own observations are in accordance with his on this point.
He has also made a number of very interesting observations in this connexion on the
