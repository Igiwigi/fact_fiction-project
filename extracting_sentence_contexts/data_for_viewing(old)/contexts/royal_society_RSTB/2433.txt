rupture being somewhat irregular (compare fig. 4 of Gi. circinata). Now, in the
sporangium of Hymenophyllum dilatatum, the similarity of which as regards form
and orientation of the sporangium and output of spores to GJ. cireinata has already
been remarked, the structure leads to a lateral rupture. It appears a reasonable
suggestion that there has been a shifting of the position of the thin-walled region
which determined dehiscence ; that while the annulus itself maintained its oblique
position, certain of the cells of the wall in a lateral position were not indurated, and
the lateral dehiscence followed. The case of Loxsoma strengthens this suggestion,
for in it we see that cells which are typically indurated may remain thin-walled, or
even isolated cells of the part usually thin may be thick-walled. This shows a want Â©
of constancy of the induration in an individual case. Again, in Thyrsopteris, the
large sporangium has an irregular annulus, oblique in position, of which the induration
is incomplete on one side, and it is an interesting fact in this connection that the
actual point of dehiscence is not uniform in this case. Matonia, again, though it
maintains characters of the sorus and sporangium which suggest comparison with
Glvichenia, has a lateral dehiscence determined in position by the incomplete annulus.

It is to be noted that in these cases there is no highly specialised stomium, such as is
found in many Leptosporangiate Ferns. They appear to illustrate just such non-
specialised dehiscence as might be expected in cases where there has been a shifting
of the line of dehiscence from the median to a lateral position. Though the facts
noted do not in any way demonstrate that such a shifting has taken place along any
