Though naturally it is not possible to
establish an exact numerical proportion of spore-output to other morphological
characters, still the figures above given so far follow parallel to other structural
details, such as size and thickness of stalk, that the spore-enumerations may be taken
as a fair indication of them, The several families may be laid out on these grounds
as probable sequences, and we may see in those with larger spore-output a suggestion
for a nearer affinity to the more massive types, while those with smaller output from
smaller sporangia will be recognised as more remote. An extreme case is that of
Gleichenia flabellata, which shows a higher numerical output per sporangium than
any other Leptosporangiate Fern, and approaches in this respect most nearly to the
Marattiacexe. The fact that its sorus is of the very same type—with a radiate
uniseriate arrangement of sporangia, simultaneously produced, and with median
dehiscence—is in itself a strong justification of the method of comparison on the
basis of spore-enumerations,

BroLocy or THE Sorvus. In contemplating the sorus from the biological point of view, its modifications may
be traced as fitting it to attain three ends :—

(1) The production and nutrition of numerous effective spores.
(2) Their adequate protection till maturity.
(3) The proper mechanical facilities for their dissemination when mature. It is to be noted at the outset that (2) and (3) are conflicting factors, for the more
completely the young sporangia are enveloped for purposes of protection, the
more elaborate will need to be the mechanical arrangements for the successful
shedding of the mature spores.
