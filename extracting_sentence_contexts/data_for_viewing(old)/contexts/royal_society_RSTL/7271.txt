whence a more extensive prospect may be obtained.

Before proceeding to take a survey of the new field thus opened up, it is necessa
first to call special attention to a negative or chlorous organic radical intimately coz
nected with the compounds above described.

The Radical Oratyl.

An inspection of the above and following formulee for acids of the lactic series 8ho
that, through all the changes of the lactic acid type giving rise to the various species 0!
acids mentioned below, the group CO Ho remains unaltered. Woe have also show
that the same group maintains its individuality unimpaired throughout the acetic and
acrylic series of acids; in fact it is the presence of this group which impresses upon an
organic compound the acid character. We believe, therefore, that its claims to be con»
sidered a compound radical are at least equal to those of any other group of elements
to which that term has been applied.

We propose for this radical the name ozaty!*—a word recalling at the same time it:
