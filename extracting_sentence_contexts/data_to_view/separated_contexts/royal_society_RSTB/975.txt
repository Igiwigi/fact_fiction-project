east off, and many have come to the conclusion that, although Wriit1ams (78,

; not seem to be improbable that the extent of the denudation normally

severe menstrual denudation at different times. This variation, in the

y of the process, may possibly account for much of the difference of opinion

1 amongst gynecologists on this matter; but a more probable cause of the

‘views held appears to me to be the fact, that a sufficient number of specimens
xn menstruating uteri, in good preservation, are rarely obtainable by any one
digator. For instance, it is not unfrequently stated that uteri at the height of
menstrual period, and filled with blood, are found to be possessed of uterine
lium intact, and such evidence is considered sufficient to prove that neither the

ium nor the underlying stroma is cast off during the process. The evidence I

brought forward in this paper, however, shows that, although it is quite true

,Bterus may be filled with blood while the epithelium is apparently intact—the

off being derived from the lacune through minute ruptures in the epithelial
g—examinations of later stages do show denudation, and prove that the

YReight of the menstrual cycle is not reached when the blood first flows into the

ane cavity.
