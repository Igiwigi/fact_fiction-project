these forms may have evolved from the smaller distomids, the absence of such
structures may not have much significance. The loss associated with dwarfness
might readily be permanent. As in the distomids, the septum of the stolonic vessel

is mesenchymatous and arises at the base of the pericardium. This is so in both
blastozooid and oozooid of Clavelina, and nowhere does it arise from the epicardium
as stated, though not figured, by VAN BeNEDEN and Juin (1886) (cf. BERRILL,
1935, b). There is, in fact, no evidence at all that the stolonic septum is any way
associated with the epicardium, and the epicardium cannot be said to be an organ
primarily concerned with budding, except in certain highly specialized forms.

One of such forms is Diplosoma (and the family to which it belongs, the Didemnidae).
The gut-loop and heart is similar to that of Distaplia or Colella, although the ventral
stolonic vessel has disappeared.

In this genus the epicardia or perivisceral sacs are so small that they of necessity
remain separate from one another, and they undoubtedly function primarily as
