tubercles are clearly seen to make up most of the lateral shell masses.

Brady states that the species has ‘obvious affinities to Trochammina’, perhaps in
the sense that Trochammina was used in 1864. In 1884 (p. 66) he placed it in the
Lituolidae, subfamily Endothyrinae. One must disagree with this on the ground that
Problematina liassica is calcareous, practically symmetrical in vertical section, and with
the body tube non-septate.

While Bornemann had specimens of P. liassica available for study from the Lower
Lias of Wadenberg, near Eisenach, Germany, he appears to have relied on Terquem’s
descriptions and figures for his views on the other species assigned by that author to
Involutina. Bornemann confirmed the calcareous nature of the test of Problematina
liassica (which was in fact so described by Terquem for his Jnvolutina jonesi and I. des-
longchampsi), and found a very small residue of sand grains after solution of the test, the
origin of which he considered doubtful. He also described and figured (plate 19,
figure 7) a section of a portion of the wall of the test, which showed many pores, now
interpreted as superficial pits. Since Terquem’s descriptions and figures of his Involu-
lina species are generally inadequate to define them, and, I believe, sometimes incorrect
and misleading, such a revision as Bornemann’s is liable to grave errors. Before the
group can be adequately revised it will be essential to study Terquem’s types, if they
are still extant, and probably topotype material for sectioning.

Terquem claims (1862, 2FL, Introduction, p. 426) that, on solution of a specimen of
I. jonesi in hydrochloric acid, he found a yellow residue which had filled the interior of
the shell. This cast showed that the test had numerous chambers separated by partial
