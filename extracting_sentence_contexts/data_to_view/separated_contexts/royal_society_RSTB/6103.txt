Table XVII shows the results of these experiments on both species. In nearly
every instance the upper temperature limit is sharply defined. Two significant
facts are observed : (a) that in both species the thermal death point of puparia
exposed on the 15th day is higher by 2° C (3-6° F) than that of those on the Ist day ;
and (6) that on both the Ist and 15th days the thermal death point of Glossina

submorsitans is 1° C higher than that of tachinoides. Results of exposures on the Ist
and 15th days are not comparable with those on the 22nd—27th, since in the latter
emergences are recorded, and those which failed to emerge may have survived the
experiment but died subsequently. The thermal death point of submorsitans puparia
exposed on the 15th day is the same as that found by Nasu for puparia exposed
for a day on the surface of the soil (Nasu, 1933a, p. 181).
