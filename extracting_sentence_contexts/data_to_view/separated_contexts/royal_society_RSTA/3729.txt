The conclusions valid for a periodic distribution of graphene ribbons also hold in the two-
dimensional case. To illustrate this, we calculated the linear and nonlinear optical response of a
two-dimensional array of square graphene patches with side length, W. This particular choice
of the shape of graphene patches was guided by the fact that numerical simulations converge
much faster in the case of square patches when compared to discs. From the results presented
in figure 8, it can also be seen that in the two-dimensional case there are certain values of W for


which a graphene plasmon mode exists at the FF and TH wavelengths. To be more specific, for
W =84nm, the graphene diffraction grating supports a (fundamental) plasmon mode at the FF
corresponding to App = 9.69 1m and a third-order plasmon mode at ATy = Agp/3 =3.23 pm.
