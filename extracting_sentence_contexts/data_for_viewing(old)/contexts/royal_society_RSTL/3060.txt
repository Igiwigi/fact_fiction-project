the spring : then moving the arm gently forward with the right hand, the point
will slide along the end of the index till it drops into a small cavity (z) formed
for its reception, and which exactly coincides with the axis of the metallic bar
in the register, and the centre of motion of the compasses'on the brass rule.
The minute of the degree must then be noted, which the nonius indicates upon
the arc. A 8imilar observation must be made after the register has been ex-

posed to an increased temperature and again cooled; and the number of
degrees or minutes which the nonius will then mark will, by a simple calcula-
tion from the known length of the radii and angle, give the length of the chord
comprised between the original position of the compasses and the point to
which they have moved, or the distance which the index has been forced for-
ward. Such an operation appears complex in the description, but is in fact
extremely simple after a little practice, and does not require-more than a Å¿ew
Seconds for its performance. The scale of this pyrometer being completely

detached from the part which is exposed to the fire, obviates one important
objection which has always been made to other contrivances of the same
nature, from the uncertain degree of heat and expansion to which they are
liable ; while the simplicity of that part of the arrangement. which alone is 8ub-
jected to great heats, renders it little liable to injury ; and together with the
cheapness of the materials of which it is constructed, occasions but a very
