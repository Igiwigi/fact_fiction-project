Original size.

= Cat, under the influence of nicotine. 2°5 cub. centims. of a 0°1 per cent. solution of neurine were

2 injected. The result is a fall of blood-pressure without any secondary rise.

& 4. Local Flushing with a Solution of Neurine.—These conclusions are confirmed
é. by the effect of the local application of neurine solution ; there is some preliminary
constriction of the vessels, but the most marked effect is flushing of the intestines
g and a corresponding rise of the oncometer lever. It was a little difficult to be quite
sure in these cases that one had to deal merely with a local effect, for such small
3 doses of the alkaloid are efficacious that the absorption of even a small amount of it
= would produce general effects. The tracings we obtained show, in fact, that the drug
5 was absorbed in sufficient amount to produce a general effect on the arterial pressure.
2 We have, therefore, considered it hardly worth while to reproduce any of these

tracings.
8. EXPERIMENTS ON NERVES.

We have stated that the effect of choline is upon the neuro-muscular mechanism
of the blood vessels. The question still remains whether the alkaloid acts on the
muscular fibres, or the nerves that supply them.

We know of no method which will enable us to distinguish between activity of
