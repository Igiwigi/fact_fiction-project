The existence of the small amount of laughter in the No
Adult Talk and Adult to Adult Talk sessions may be due to
the fact that parents occasionally violated recording protocol
and attended to infants briefly. Note that the scales are differ-

visualize the differences in the low laugh rates across ages. Regardless of circumstances or age, protophones (figure 2c)
were >14 times more frequent than laughs in the laboratory
at every age and every circumstance.
