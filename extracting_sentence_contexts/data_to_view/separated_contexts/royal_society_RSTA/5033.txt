Metals are thus magnificent conductors of
electricity and ultimately this is what distinguishes them from non-metals; the broadest, modern
definition of metals and the metallic state is therefore of a substance transmitting electricity by
electron transfer [3]. Even armed with room-temperature electrical conductivity data (as shown in figure 1), one
can fairly easily identify elements of the periodic table for which the designation ‘metal’ or ‘non-
metal’ is clearly appropriate. The difference in electrical conductivities between a metallic element
and a non-metallic element (under ambient conditions) is itself a striking fact; between the most
conductive elements (copper and silver) and the most resistive (sulfur, for example) it amounts to
23 orders of magnitude [5]. This range of over 10+? in electrical conductivity (or rather its inverse,
resistivity, the quantity customarily used in the application of Ohm’s law) has been cited as one
of the most widely ranging of all physical properties [5,6]. Furthermore—and remarkably—this
range in the elements’ electrical property is even larger at low temperatures; the temperature
dependence of the electrical resistivity of non-metals is in every way in direct contrast to that of
metals [7].
