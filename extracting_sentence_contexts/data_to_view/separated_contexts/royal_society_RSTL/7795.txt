As the illuminated portion of the solar disk gradually increased
after totality, the clouds rapidly disappeared, the estimated amount falling from 9 (over-
cast=10) to 3 in about fifteen minutes. 'The observations were then regularly continued
to within a few minutes of last contact. Although the disk and by far the greater portion of the heavens were completelyobscured
by clouds during the period of totality, rendering any determination of the photochemical
action perfectly valueless in view of our special object, it was yet thought worth while
to attempt to estimate the chemical intensity of the feebly diffused light at this time,
That it has a certain degree of actinism is of course evident from the fact that photo-
graphs can be taken during totality. Immediately, therefore, after the supposed com-
mencement of totality the slit was opened, and the sensitive paper exposed for ninety-five
seconds; as the end of totality was very plainly indicated about two or three seconds
after the slit had been again closed, it was clear that the paper had been exposed only
during the period of totality. Not the slightest action, however, could be detected on
the paper; on comparing them in the dark room it appeared considerably lighter than
the extreme light end of the graduated strip.
