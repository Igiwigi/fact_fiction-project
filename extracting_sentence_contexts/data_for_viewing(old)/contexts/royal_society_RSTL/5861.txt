of both ball and ring, struck me as the most noticeable point; for even with a power of
500, I could not fancy anything more clear at its edges than they were.

These observations were repeated on Saturn during several mornings, and are all the
more noteworthy, since that is about the time when telescopic definition in most obser-
vatories becomes exceedingly bad. On the mountain the swn was seldom well defined,
and his excessive radiation seemed to disturb the air, and in a manner that often lasted
in the western regions long after he had set; but night usually succeeded in quieting
the commotion.

Thus far the facts of observation have been stated ; and the main explanation of them
is evidently the other fact, that when looking at the stars on the mountain, we were
not looking through those grosser and denser strata of the lower regions of the atmo-
sphere through which ordinary observers must look. On the mountain we found another
cireumstance operating, whose existence is not generally suspected: this is the prevar-
lence of excessive drought. Had there been any actual formation of dew, there would
have been difficulty in keeping the glasses free; and with the smallest portion forming
on them, adieu to all delicacy of vision. But in a region where the average depression
of the dew-point was, as we found it, the unheard of quantity of 40?, and where it was
not unfrequently above 50?, the formation of dew was physically impossible.

Hence some of our best observing nights were on occasions that in a moister atmo-
