Though the Ni
sulfide complex identified by Landing & Lewis [65] was not specifically modelled by Fujii et al.
[62], they do find A Ninj2+-Ni(HS)* = +0.66%0 at 25Â°C. Such a fractionation is at least consistent
with the data array beneath 300 m in the water column of the Black Sea, with the exception of a
single datapoint (figure 6b). As noted by Little et al. [48], one initially puzzling aspect of Black Sea sediment data for Ni
is that euxinic sediments are significantly enriched despite the fact that deep Ni concentrations
are not significantly lower than at the surface. The solution to this conundrum suggested by
these authors is that there is significant addition of Ni to the deep Black Sea via a benthic Fe/Mn
redox shuttle. The transport of Fe and Mn from the shelf to the open basin may occur via nano-
particulate oxides [53], which will carry sorbed trace metals.
