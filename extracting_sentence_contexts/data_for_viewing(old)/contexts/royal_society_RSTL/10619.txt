S This fraction is tolerably small, but I had expected to find it smaller still. It seems
Â£ probable that the incompleteness of compensation is due to a small difference (o059)
5 in the mean diameter of the windings in the two cases. To throw light upon this
T took careful measures of the resistances of the two wires, Although they had
originally formed one length, their resistances differed by as much as th part, that
of the wire which had shown itself Teast effective being 7:075 B.A., and of the other
6965. Tf, as it seems plausible to do, we attribute the difference of resistance to
difference of diameter, this actual difference must amount to 5255 inch. The mean
diameter of the windings is about three inches ; and if the two wires were wound upon
a 8mooth cylinder of this diameter, the difference in the diameter of the windings
would be z7257 of the whole. As this estimate would be inereased were we to take
into account the fact that each winding really sits upon two windings of the layer
underneath, and that these cannot be practically in actual contact, we may perhaps
