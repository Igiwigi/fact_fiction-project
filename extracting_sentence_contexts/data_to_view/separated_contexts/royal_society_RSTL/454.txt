S. Read February 25, 1802. Tux concordance of a variety of facts seems to render it most
indisputable, that certain stony and metalline substances have,
at different periods, fallen on the earth. Whence their origin,
or whence they came, is yet, in my judgment, involved in
complete obscurity. The accounts of these peculiar substances, in the early annals,
even of the Royal Society, have unfortunately been blended with
relations which we now consider as fabulous; and the more
ancient histories of stones fallen from Heaven, from Jupiter, or
from the clouds, have evidently confounded such substances
with what have been termed Ceraunia, Butilia, Ombria, Brontia,
&c. names altogether unappropriate to suhstances fallen on our
globe.
