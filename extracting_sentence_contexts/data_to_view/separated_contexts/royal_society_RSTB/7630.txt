This is
shown by considering what is required to do well in an intelligence test: for one type of problem one must
identify a pattern or structure in a series of items, and the solution is obtained by continuing that pattern;
the solution to other problems results from having applied this paradigm in one’s everyday experience. The second insight is that structure or redundancy (in the information theory sense) constitutes knowl-
edge (Barlow 1996). This follows directly from the fact that both of them define some way in which a set of
messages deviates from complete randomness. These insights from information theory tell one that intelligence is the process of identifying redun-
dancy, and that knowledge is the store of identified redundancy that this process builds up. This resolves
the paradox, pointed to by Gregory (1987), that one thinks of knowledgeable people as being intelligent,
yet the more knowledge one has, the less intelligence is likely to be needed for solving a problem; he
names these ‘kinetic intelligence’ and ‘potential intelligence’ by analogy with creating and storing
energy, though information is actually related to entropy, not energy.
