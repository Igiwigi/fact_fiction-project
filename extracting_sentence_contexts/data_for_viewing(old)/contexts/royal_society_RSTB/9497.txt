(b) Improving transparency

This is a call for greater candour in case files, report writing
and the presentation of findings in court: to be able to articu-
late the weight to be assigned to each feature considered
without resorting to comfort statements such as ‘friction
ridge skin impressions are unique’,* ‘all three levels of fea-
tures have been used in conjunction’, or ‘it is my opinion
based on my training and experience’.

Is it just an opinion? Yes, it is, and, at the moment, it does
not offer a lot to the fact finder to assess its quality. I agree
with Cole [77], there is a risk in ‘opinionization’ because it
can range from respectful informed opinions to mere
opinions. But more crucially, an opinion of say ‘identification’
between a mark and a print cannot be critically assessed.
Indeed there is an impossibility to articulate what comes
from the context and the cost-benefit analysis and what
comes from the forensic findings, i.e. the comparison itself.
I cannot see any other way out than to concentrate the testi-
mony of the expert only on the comparison alone and
refrain from any consideration of context or valuation of
consequences given by correct and false decisions.
