Figure 1. Translating LOFAR’s angular and spectral resolution into k , and k,. (a) The shaded regions represent the values of k ,
which can be reached by the Dutch core (purple), Dutch remote (blue) and international (green) stations. The gap in between
them arises from the fact that there is a large geographical distance between the outermost Dutch stations and the closest
international stations. The grey shaded region on the left shows the horizon limit. (6) The grey lines show the limits on k;, based
on the total bandwidth (48 MHz) and the smallest frequency resolution possible in a standard observing mode (0.76 kHz). The
frequency spacing will be channelized, and the colour scale runs from wider channels (blue), which means more infrequent
coverage in kj space, to narrower channels (orange), which means more frequent coverage in ky, space. This is plotted as a
continuous shaded region, but in practice will be discrete. (Online version in colour.)

waves pass through the atmosphere (which would not be a problem for a lunar array), the
foregrounds consist of Galactic emission and extragalactic sources. The Galactic foreground,
in particular, has a steep power-law spectrum, with S, «v2. Extragalactic sources are also
contaminants, and can range in shape and size from compact galaxies up to bright radio relics
in galaxy clusters. Modelling and subtracting these forergrounds is perhaps the most obvious
approach, but in practice this becomes extremely complex and difficult to do with high accuracy.
