The constrained variational problem, known as double obstacle problem, is given by

Note that in the particular case of W2=+00, the problem reduces to the classical obstacle
problem which is more or less a closed chapter [2,3]. Notwithstanding this, a huge number of
interesting applications in diverse areas in analysis have arisen in recent years; among them are
the theory of quadrature domains, and related problems such as Laplacian growth, algebraic
droplets of Coulomb gas ensembles, potential theoretic equilibrium measure and its random
matrix models [15].

The double obstacle case, however, is much less studied; this depends on less developed
appropriate technical tools, and (probably) on the fact that it has been considered as an ‘easy’
generalization of the one-sided obstacle problem. This is of course the case if one considers the
problem at points away from the part of the free boundary that is ‘sandwiched’ between both
obstacles.

Here, we want to show how it is possible to restate this problem in a form that allows us to
deduce regularity of solutions as a corollary of general results for unconstrained problems. As we
shall see, it is actually possible to replace the Laplacian by a fully nonlinear operator and still get
optimal regularity.

2Note that if 1,12 € C1(B1) and 1 = 15 in the complement of @, then their gradients agree there and we are saying that 11
and us are functions solving some nice equation inside @ and satisfy both 1 = 12 and Viy = Vuln on 82 N By.
