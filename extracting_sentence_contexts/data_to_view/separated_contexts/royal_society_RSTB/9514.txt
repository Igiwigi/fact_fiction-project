To the best of our knowledge, no systematic
comparisons of stone-knapping and nut-cracking have been
undertaken. Such a comparison is the purpose of this paper. Whereas much prior interest has been placed on the
mental operations necessary in these tasks (coordination,
symbolic representation, planning and comprehension of
cause-effect relationships), such comparisons are limited by
the fact that each activity is technically distinct, defined by
a different chaine opératoire [36]. Here, focus will be placed
on the elementary actions themselves—the use of a stone
hammer to crack a nutshell and retrieve the nut inside,
and the use of the (same) stone hammer to remove a
sharp-edged flake from a flint core. It is necessary at this point to describe the two tasks under
study.
