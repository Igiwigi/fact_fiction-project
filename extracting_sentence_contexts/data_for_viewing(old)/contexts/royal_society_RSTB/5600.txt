of the anterior commissure, passes over it, sending loose fibres into the septum in the
region of the medial nucleus, turns ventralward, contributing fibres to the area
sub-commissuralis and probably to its nucleus, and passes on into the hypothalamus.

The infracommissural bundle (infracom.b., figs. 37 and 40) turns ventro-caudal just
dorsal to the anterior commissure. Some of the fibres pass into the hypothalamus
(str.t.hypoth., figs. 36 and 37) and others into the lateral part of the area subcommis-
suralis.

The longitudinal bundle (.b., figs. 23, 24, 42, 51 and 66) appears as a distinct fibre
bundle in the caudal limit of the endorhinal fissure. It passes dorso-laterally so that
its fibres penetrate the medial, the basal and the cortical amygdaloid nuclei. The
writer has been unable to circumscribe definitely its origin. The fact that it appears
as a definite bundle at about the transverse level of the nucleus olfactorius lateralis
with a few fibres anterior, suggests that it may connect the lateral subcortical olfactory
areas with the amygdaloid complex. In all probability fibres from the pyriform lobe
enter it and are distributed caudally to amygdaloid nuclei.

Connections between the nuclei of the corpus striatum (nuc.c.str., figs. 19 and 45) and
the amygdaloid are made by two distinct fibre bundles, traceable in either longitudinal
or transverse series from the two nuclei in question, forming an arc of a great circle
about the ventro-lateral part of the corpus striatum and passing into the nuclei
amygdale basalis and lateralis.
