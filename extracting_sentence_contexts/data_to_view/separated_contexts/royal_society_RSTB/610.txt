To cells in the cord.
2. To cells in the medulla.

1. There are two long afferent or centripetal tracts in the cord which arise from
cells, and pass upwards to the brain.

(a.) Fibres of direct cerebellar tract which arise from CuarKke’s column; it is an
uncrossed path between the fibres of the posterior root and the cerebellum. “The
fact that it degenerates upwards indicates that we are to look uponit as a centripetal
conducting system. A portion of the lateral cerebellar tract is supposed not to enter
the corpus restiforme, but to go on brainwards as far as the corpora quadrigemina,
and then near the fillet to turn backwards, and so lying near the surface of the brachium
to stream into the cerebellum.”* According to Becutsrew,t it conveys impulses in
connection with localization in space, although it is possible that it may convey tactile
impressions.

(b.) Fibres of antero-lateral.—These are considered to arise from cells of the posterior
horn, and are supposed to decussate either in the anterior or posterior commissures, or
both. I think it possible that these may arise from cells of the grey matter of the
same side.
