From what we have said, there is hence no doubt that our formula B = W'/k holds
good for the blood volume of rabbits within the range of our experiments. That is,
as we have said above, that the blood volume of the rabbit is a function of the
surface,

At the same time, it will be seen from our experiments that it is absolutely
unjustifiable to consider the blood volume as a function of the weight of the animal,
since the body weight divided by the blood volume is never a constant for animals of
different weights. The importance of this is seen from the fact that, while a rabbit of 1340 grammes
contains 5째7 per cent. of blood, that is 1/17째7 of its body weight, a rabbit of
3039 grammes only contains 4째5 per cent. of blood, or 1/22째4 of its body weight.
