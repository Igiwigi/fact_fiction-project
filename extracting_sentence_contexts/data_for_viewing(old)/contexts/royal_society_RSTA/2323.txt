It is easy to see that the ¢;’s agree locally. Indeed, both 0 and 1 are valid assignments for a single
variable, which is the most two valuations can have in common. On the other hand, the fact that
the liar cycle gives rise to a paradox means that the valuations do not agree globally. Indeed, a
global assignment of truth values to each s1,...,S; consistent with formulae (3.3) is impossible,
as they collectively yield s1 <> -s1.

4. Non-locality and contextuality

We shall now expose a surprising connection between the valuation algebraic theory of
disagreement with a completely different topic, namely the study of non-locality and
contextuality in quantum foundations. This will show that all of the examples of local agreement
versus global disagreement we have just presented are in fact mathematically equivalent to
contextuality. We will adopt the sheaf-theoretic description of contextuality developed in [3]. We
will now review the main definition, assuming basic knowledge of sheaf theory and category
