The results in figure 6 assume a uniform rainfall across both rural and urban catchments.
Given the flashiness of the urban response, this assumption has a large bearing on the extent
of subsequent surcharging of the drainage network. Differing storm tracks will alter the relative
timing of the two responses, potentially creating wider (or reduced) surface flooding. Evaluation
over a wider range of storm scenarios would provide a more detailed understanding of the
mitigating effects of the selected NFM interventions.

All of these findings must be tempered by significant sources of error in the modelling.
Uncertainty in distributed hydrological modelling generally has been extensively discussed in
the literature [57-60]. In addition, although the calibration procedure produced a reasonable fit
with observed flows and has academic precedent, it is a highly idealized approach. Another
significant source of uncertainty comes from the fact the evidence behind the impact of physical
NFM remains inconclusive. Any numerical replication of intervention impact is therefore subject
to significant error (in terms of both magnitude and parameterization). Although representation
of the interventions used in this study has been informed by the literature (table 1), extrapolation
of their impact within the Asker catchment introduces further uncertainty.

Further study would benefit from sensitivity analyses of these numerical permutations
to improve confidence in their downstream impact. Another source of error is the loose-
coupling mechanisms between the three constituent models: dynamic TOPMODEL, HEC-RAS
and Infoworks ICM, which prevents any feedback between systems. Inputs into the river channel
model from the hydrological model are independent of the level in the receiving watercourse.
The 2D HEC-RAS model itself has been based on a 5m DEM (in the absence of sufficient river
section data) and while this has enabled representation of woody debris across the catchment,
