Cognitive dissonance describes a state
of conflict that arises when two or more competing beliefs
are simultaneously held, and cognitive dissonance theory
states that humans are motivated to reduce this conflict by
altering one of these beliefs [71]. This effect is also observed
in humans when behaviour contradicts belief. In a forced
compliance study, subjects completed an exceptionally mono-
tonous experiment, after which a subset were instructed to tell
new participants who were arriving for the study that it was in
fact ‘a very interesting and enjoyable experience’. They found
that those subjects who were induced to give a positive
report to new participants gave more favourable ratings of
their own experience in the study on a subsequent question-
naire [72]. This study convincingly demonstrates that in
situations of cognitive dissonance, when behaviour contradicts
belief, humans alter their beliefs to match their behaviour.
