S vessels.
5 The constriction of the arteries, which resulted in this case from irritation of the
A posterior half of the cord isolated from the rest, and the permanent dilatation which
ensued on removal of the same part, prove that this portion of the cerebro-spinal axis cer-
tainly contains a nervous centre for regulating-the contractions of the arteries of the feet.
The frequently alternating contractions and dilatations which occurred in this animal, as
well as in the last, after irritation of the posterior half of the cord, are curious, and may
perhaps be considered analogous to rapid action of the heart under the influence of
Stimulus. The fact that the arterial contractions 80 constantly observed to result from
irritation of the anterior part of the cord, while it retains its connexion through the rest
of the cord with the roots of the nerves of the hind legs, fail to occur after removal of
the posterior two-thirds of the cord, has been confirmed by subsequent experiments
upon other frogs. It appears to imply that if the brain and anterior part of the cord
discharge the functions of a nervous centre for the arteries of the feet, they do not exert
