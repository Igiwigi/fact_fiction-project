K275. The direction in which the scattered wave vanishes will be given by

(5°32) $ = 42, cos @ = A,/C, = 2F (x,a)/{3—F («,a)},

the final formula being simplified by remembering that K is large. I am not aware that there is any experimental evidence showing traces of this phenomenon ; in fact all
the evidence shows that ¢ = 0, = 47 is not far from the truth. Thus the circumstances in actual
experiments cannot have been such as to introduce the reversal of magnitude between A, and C,.
