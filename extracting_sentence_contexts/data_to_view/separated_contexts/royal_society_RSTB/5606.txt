Again no immediate effect follows this
rearrangement of the factors ; the F, brood is entirely dextral instead of a 3 : 1 mixture
of dextrals and sinistrals ; each egg has been dextrally determined, prior to gameto-
genesis, by the dextral-determining factor introduced by the sperm at the original
cross. But the rearrangement of the factors that took place at the fertilisation of the
F, eggs becomes apparent in the F; broods; thus of the resulting F, dextral snails
three in every four produce dextral broods and one produces a sinistral brood. Again
this result depends upon the fact that the final determination of the twist of the eggs
of a snail takes place prior to gametogenesis, and the type of coil exhibited by its young
depends on the presence or absence of a dominant dextral determining factor in its
nucleus. That this delay is not due to any general abnormality in the behaviour of the chromo-
somes is practically certain, from the normal behaviour of albinism in the same snails ;
and that the nuclear changes qua twist are also normal is further supported by back-
crossing, which gives this result :—*
