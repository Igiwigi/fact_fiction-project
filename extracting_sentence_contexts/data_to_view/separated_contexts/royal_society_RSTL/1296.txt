The kidneys were altered considerably in their texture, and
their pelvis much enlarged, the left was pressed up higher
than natural, and adhered firmly to the spleen. The right
was attached to the ascending colon, and general adhesion
had obtained between all the surrounding parts. The ureters
were much increased in their dimensions and thickness, and
were capable of containing a considerable quantity of fluid ;
they were in fact supplemental bladders, the real bladder
having become nothing more than a painful and difficult con-
ductor of urine, which trickled down in furrows formed by it
on the superior surface of the stone. This clearly explained
the cause which obliged the patient, when compelled to eva-
cuate urine, to put himself in that posture which made the
upper part of the bladder become the lower, by which means
a relaxation or separation was allowed to take place between
the bladder and the stone, so that the ureters had an oppor-
tunity of discharging their contents ; when the body was erect,
their mouths, or valvular openings, must of course have been
closed, by the pressure of the abdominal viscera on the bladder
against the stone. His difficulty of voiding urine, appears to have gradually
increased as the bladder became more and more filled with the
stony matter, and the extremity.
