the same liquid had not been subjected to any electrical action until the tran!
current used in the measurement was employed. It might possibly be urge
answer to this that we have no evidence that the thickness of the black was the
in each case—that we may have been dealing with f, in the one case and ; in
other. If this were so the equality of the throws could only be explained by
hypothesis that the product of the thickness and specific conductivity is the same
f, and 8, and this is inconsistent with the large change in resistance which
substitution of one for the other has been proved above to produce,


THICKNESS AND ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE OF THIN LIQUID FILMS, 517

Tn fact the observations are perhaps open to criticism of a precisely opposite kind,
yiz., that in view of the irregularities in the value of B obtained by our ordinary
method of measurement, it is strange that on this occasion we should have obtained
the same result in the case of two consecutive films. Such coincidences were not
uncommon ; but the objection is, perhaps, best answered indirectly by comparing the
throws in the case of salted and unsalted solutions, and thus determining whether
the ratio of the computed apparent thicknesses is about the same when transient and
continuous currents are used. This experiment we have performed. With a solution
containing 3 per cent. of KNO, the throw was 19 divisions of the scale. With an
Wnsalted solution when the black had descended to the same level the throw was
35 divisions. The specific resistances of the two liquids were 36 and 890 ohms per
@ibic centim. respectively. If 7, and ¢, are the resistance and calculated thickness of
ihe unsalted film, and p, is the specitic resistance of the liquid of which it is formed ;
