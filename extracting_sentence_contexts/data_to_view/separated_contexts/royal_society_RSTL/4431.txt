Thus the
action proceeds by a continual oxidation and reduction of the substance, the phenomena being very similar to
the oxidation of the chromic acid by the peroxide of hydrogen and the spontaneous decomposition of the com-
pound formed, By mixing the chlorate of potash with oxide of copper, the formation of the perchlorate is en-
tirely prevented, and the action converted into one of spontaneous decomposition. ,

+ The idea of polarity has been applied to the explanation of chemical phenomena by other chemists as well
as myself, I may refer especially to L5w1c's Introduction to his Organic Chemistry (vol. i. p. 1, Edition 1845). Granan also has given, in the last edition of his Treatise on Chemistry, a chapter on Chemical Polarity, It
would be out of place to enter here on any criticizm of their views or comparison of them with my own, but I
give the reference for those who may be desirous to see the way in which others have treated this subject.

772 MR. BRODIE ON THE CONDITION OP CERTAIN ELEMENTS

1818, no new fact of the slightest importance has been added to its history. The
properties however of which I speak, can all be obseryed with the solution of the
peroxide of barium, in hydrochloric or acetic acid, which can be readily prepared. The properties of this solution are different according as it is alkaline or acid.
