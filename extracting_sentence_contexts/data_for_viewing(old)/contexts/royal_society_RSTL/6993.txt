3rd. The double entrance of the fibres at the apex, and their exit in two sets from
the left auriculo-ventricular opening.

4th. The manner in which the apex is opened into, and enlarged, by the remoyal of
8UCCesSIVe layers.

5th. The gradual increase in the thickness of the layers when the dissection is con-
ducted from without inwards. This is in all probability owing to the more internal or
deeper layers being the firs formed. Thus the seventh or deepest internal layer, which I
am inclined to think is developed before the sixth, goes on increasing part passt with
it; while the seventh and sixth increase equally with the fifth, which is a later forma-
tion; and 80 on until the firs, which is the thinnest layer, is reached. That this
explanation has its foundation in truth, is probable from the fact that, in imitating the
process by which I believe the left ventricle is formed, the seyenth or most internal
layer supplies a basis of support for the more superficial layersâ€”just in the same way
that the smaller and more central turns of a shell form the basis of support for the
peripheral or more superficial turns*.

External layers of the left ventricle of the Mammal.

Superficial or first external layer. On looking at the left auriculo-ventricular opening
of the sheep and calf posteriorly (Plate XII. fig. 1, b, and Plate XV. fig. 46, b), when
the serous membrane, fat, vessels, and neryes have been remoyed, the fibres are seen to
is8ue from it in fascicular bundles, and to curve over its margin all round (d, f).
