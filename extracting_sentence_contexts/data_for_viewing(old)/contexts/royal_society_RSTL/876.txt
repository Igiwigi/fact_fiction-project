begun, to exa:aine, by experiments made expressly for the pur-
pose, every assertion respecting the effect of alloys, this long
established opinion would not here have been questioned.

Indeed, considering how easy it was to ascertain whether
or not gold could be rendered brittle by the addition of iron,
it is a matter of astonishment, when we read in the works of
many celebrated chemists, and when we hear intelligent and
judicious artists assert, that iron, even in minute proportions,
injures or destroys the ductility of gold.*

It is not necessary here to inquire how this erroneous idea
first originated ; but, that the fact is absolutely the reverse, the
following experiments will sufficiently prove.

Experiment 1.

To eleven ounces one pennyweight and three grains of gold,
23 car. g7 fine, eighteen pennyweights and twenty-one grains
of clean iron wire were added.

The iron was s0on melted, and was. well mixed with the gold,
after which, the whole was poured into a greased mould of iron.
