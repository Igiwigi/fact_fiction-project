This is a contradiction to the circularity of X. The converse follows with similar arguments.

Clearly, the above result also gives a handy criterion for the C> property of trinucleotide codes,
namely by the fact that a code is CÂ° if and only if the graph of X as well as the graphs of the two
circularly permuted sets of trinucleotides of X are acyclic. Recently, C? codes played an important
role in the theory of error detection in genetic information. In particular, the maximal trinucleotide
circular code X observed in genes of bacteria, eukaryotes, plasmids and viruses [12,15] initiated a
renewed interest and had another interesting property, namely self-complementarity. Recall that
an n-nucleotide code X C B" is self-complementary if for each n-nucleotide from X the reversed
complemented n-nucleotide is in X (see [30] for more details on C3 codes). As an illustration we
give the graph associated with the maximal self-complementary C? code found in [12,15].

Example 2.7. There are 12 964 440 maximal circular codes of 20 trinucleotides [12]. The maximal
trinucleotide circular code X observed in genes of bacteria, eukaryotes, plasmids and viruses
[12,15] has the following 20 trinucleotides:
