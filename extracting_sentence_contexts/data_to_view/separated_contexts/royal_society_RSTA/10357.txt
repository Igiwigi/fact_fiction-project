The evidence so far obtained is, it is true, against any marked changes occurring. I have compared the spectrum obtained by SHAcKLETON in 1896 with those herein
discussed and with others obtained in 1898 and 1901, but without detecting any
certain changes in the intensities of the lines. The flash appears, in fact, to be of as
constant and unchanging a character as is the Fraunhofer spectrum, which is only
what would naturally be expected, seeing that it appears to be in the main the
reversal of that spectrum. Summary of Conclusions. In a general way the conclusions arrived at from the discussion of the spectra
obtained in 1898 are amply confirmed and extended by the present results.
