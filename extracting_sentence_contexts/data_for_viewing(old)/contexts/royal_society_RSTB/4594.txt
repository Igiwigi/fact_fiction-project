(d) The Nymphal Stages.—Among eight first stage nymphs which were dissected,
the ovaries (Plate 8, fig. 49) varied in length from 1:2 to 0°3 mm, This wide range
of variation appears to be due, to some extent, to the age of the individual. The
developing egg-cells, however, did not in any of these examples attain a greater size
than 0°2 x 0°07 mm., and were thus smaller than the largest ova found either in the
winged females or the soldiers. In the second stage nymphs, the gonads and egg-cells
had attained slightly larger dimensions.

(e) Worker-like Forms.—Eleven worker-like females were dissected with special
reference to the gonads. The latter (Plate 8, fig. 47) do not differ from those of the
winged female, except that in several specimens they were considerably larger, owing
probably to the fact that the individuals dissected were nearer sexual maturity than
the latter. In length each ovary varied from 2°5 to 5 mm., the oviduct averaged
1 mm., and the number of ovarioles varied from about 32 to 48. Eggs attaining a
length of 0°05 mm., and over, in most cases had their follicles evident; in several
instances the longest eggs attained a measurement 10-48 mm., thus exceeding in
size any found in the winged females. I may add that these examples contained
abundant intestinal Protozoa.

(f) Larve.—In the larve the gonads (fig. 48) are markedly smaller in
size than in the adults. The tubuli of the colleterial glands are shorter, and the
spermatheca is smaller and more difficult to detect. A good deal of variation in the
size of the sexual organs was observed in larvae of apparently nearly the same age.
Furthermore, it was found that in larvee of the winged forms, the reproductive organs
