tissues of the higher animals, and this whether the current be passed in the direction
of the length or in that of the thickness of the muscular fibres.

Waves of contraction in the excitable tissues of Aurelia, when started by a very weak
stimulus, may be 80 feeble as to be barely perceptible. This fact in itself raises the pre-
sumption that the 80-called waves of stimulation, which were described in my former
paper, may really be but wayes of contraction which are too feeble to be perceptible
at all; and hence that the phenomena, of reflex action, &e., as they occur in the *
Medusme may be due, not to nerve, but to muscle. This presumption, however, is
excluded by the additional fact that very often severe section of the excitable tissues
has the effect of completely blocking even the strongest waves of contraction while
still allowing the waves of stimulation to pass freely, as shown by tentacular waves,
reflex action of the lithocyst, and writhing response of the polypite continuing to assert
themselves beyond the region in which the contractile waves have been blocked by
section,
