The energy required to remove an ethyl radical from the tin tetraethyl molecule has
been estimated thermochemically to be in the neighbourhood of 77-3 kcal. (table 11). In view of the fact that methyl radicals are usually more tightly bound than ethyl radicals,
and that the pyrolysis experiments refer to a higher temperature, agreement with the
figure 82-4 kcal. obtained from the rates of pyrolysis of tin tetramethyl is not far short of
perfect, and well inside the limits of error. In conclusion, the values obtained thermochemically for the dissociation energies of
metal-carbon bonds are in general agreement with the rather meagre evidence from other
