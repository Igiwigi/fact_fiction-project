observations, diverges considerably from the observational result, namely (see fig. 4),
in the defect of carapaces about 45. This defect largely contributes to the
asymmetrical appearance of the curve. I felt very confident that by neglecting
the eccentric group of “ giants” I could find two components, whose resultant would
fit the curve of observation as closely as the resultant-curves found for the similar
case of the forehead of Crabs. I was peculiarly interested, however, in ascertaining
whether the method of resolution by aid of the nonic would pay more attention to
the outlying giants or to the less improbable defect of individuals about 45. I even
imagined that out of the nine possible solutions some might be solutions for the
giants and some for the 45 defect. As a matter of fact, the two solutions which
have any meaning are entirely taken up with the very improbable outlying eccen-
tricities of the observations. These eccentricities must first be removed from the
observations before the method will be of service in resolving the asymmetry of the
bulk of the observation-curve.

The method in which the nonic deals with the abnormalities is very characteristic,
and I venture to think highly suggestive.

Tn fig. 4 the normal curve excluding the two giants is given. It fits the observa-
tion-curve, as far as appearances go, slightly better than the true normal curve.
But the first solution of the nonic tells us not to absolutely reject the giants. It
gives us two components, the first of which fits the observations slightly better than
