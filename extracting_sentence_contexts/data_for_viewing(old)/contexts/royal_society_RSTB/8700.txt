parameters, suggesting that the conclusion was relatively
robust. Importantly, we also found that for a given synaptic
architecture, there is a certain combination of changes in
AMPAR (and NMDAR) density and numbers that could provide
the ‘most economical’, in terms of the relative structural change,
path to the required level of synaptic potentiation or depression.

Notwithstanding the lack at present of direct experimental
evidence supporting the hypothesis of use-dependent AMPAR
nanoscale clustering, there are several factors, in addition to
being by far the most parsimonious explanation, which make
this hypothesis intellectually attractive. Firstly, this mechanism
is readily consistent with the fact that LTP reflects an increased
number of activated postsynaptic AMPARs. Because AMPARs
are normally far from saturation at the synapses under study
[22,37—-39], the expression of LTP might, in principle, reflect
either activation of newly inserted AMPARs or a higher acti-
vation level of the existing AMPARs, or perhaps both.
Secondly, because AMPAR clustering does not require an
increase in the total receptor numbers expressed within the
PSD, the involvement of complex cellular machineries engaged
in use-dependent AMPAR trafficking might not necessarily be
