bones show a condition which Mr. Busx considers to be the result of exposure to the
8wn and air on the surface of the ground. But if we follow out what may have been
the consequenee of the state of things we have suggested, both these effects would in all
probability have resulted therefrom ; for it is not conceivable but that, under favourable

REPORT ON THE EXPLORATION OF BRIXHAM CAVE. 559

nditions, the water dripping from the roof of the cave must at all times have tended to
the formation of stalagmite *; and, in fact, Mr. PeExGeLLY has shown that under such
conditions (probably sheltered places) stalagmite did form alternately with the cave-earth.
It would therefore follow that those bones which, from time to time, were exposed on
the surface of the floor of the cave to the drip from the roof would receive an incrusta-
tion of carbonate of lime of thickness proportionate to the time between their being
left by the predatory animals on the floor of the cave, and their being covered up by
8ilt (the cave-earth) from some subsequent inundation. We know also that stalagmite
did not form in all parts of the caye; and where such was the case, or where the bones
were more out of the reach of the inundating waters, some of them must have been
osed to the long-continued action of currents of air in the cave, and swch action
pwbably produced the drying and weathering effects referred by Mr. Busk to atmo-
Eh action outside the cave. It was only when the cave was no longer subject to the
rSurrence of inundations that the formation of stalagmite became uninterrupted, and
