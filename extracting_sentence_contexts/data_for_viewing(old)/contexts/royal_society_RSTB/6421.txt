band of intermediate cells in the base of the feather, and unlike the condition on
the 14th day, the cylinder cell layer is here quite distinct.

The musculature between the feather follicles is very definite, strands running
from the top of one follicle to the base of the next. Traces seem to pass between both
preplumulae and prepennae, but never so distinctly as between two prepennae.

28 days—The dead specimen of a Chinese gosling opened on the 28th day is
covered with fully formed feathers, similar in structure to those described for the
25th day, but completely cornified (except for points of fusion), and with a longer
calamus. The latter has the same crescentic base in transverse section as a duckling
protoptile, but with the convexity facing the side, instead of towards the surface of
the skin. This may be associated with the fact that the follicle of a goose protoptile
is much deeper and correspondingly more oblique than that of a fowl. Pulp is still
present, although withdrawn towards the centre in the tip of the feather.

The most striking feature of this gosling is the clearly defined blood system ; the
course of the single central blood vessel surrounded by a circle of anastomosing
capillaries is easily followed. In the definitive feather, the central vessel is clearly
seen to be an arteriole, and the anastomosing vessels in the periphery are venules.

6 days—Feather papillae appear on the 6th day of incubation in the chick, when
sections of the skin of the spinal and femoral regions show similar concentrations
