earlier recovery, and the improvement appears rather to have been in the perfection
of recovery.

Comparison may also be made with experiments (6) in which the sciatic nerves
in dogs were divided high up in the thigh, and suture made after axial

rotation of the distal segment through a semicircle. As a result of this
section the musculature below the knee became paralysed. The date on which
recovery was apparent is recorded very early, namely, from 14 to 21 days, and
the ground on which the recovery was judged was the fact that the animal was
placing the paw on the ground plantar surface down. The recovery here then
was judged on the same ground as in the animals experimented on by KiLvineron,
but appeared to have commenced at an earlier date.

(3) Superiority of the Fore-limb over the Hind-limb for Deciding the Questions ut
Tssue.

In dogs in which the hind-limb has been paralysed below the knee, the limb is still
able to be used as a support in walking despite the paralysis of the muscles, the
knee joint being supported by ligaments and tendons so as to give a rigid support.
Thus the only apparent defect is the turning over of the paw so that the animal
treads on the dorsal surface of the foot and scrapes this along until the surface is
