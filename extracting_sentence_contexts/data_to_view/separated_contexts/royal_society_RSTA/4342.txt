Much effort has been reed
focused recently on sustainable communication approaches, for instance using renewable energy .
resources to power up network equipment. Increase in energy usage translates to a larger thermal
load. In fact, in recent years, optical equipment has become constrained by thermal density limits
in central offices, in the case of air cooling [4]. Similar to electronic systems, a new generation of
devices based on optical technology must fit within the same electrical power budget per shelf
allotted to the equipment it replaces. The alternative is to increase footprint, which adds to cost.
