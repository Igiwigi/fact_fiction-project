sensibly the same for all lengths. The main interest both of Carman and of
Srewarr* was confined to tubes in excess of this limit, experiments on which may
fairly be compared with the theoretical formula (80); their results showed that this
formula gives a satisfactory estimate of the strength of very thin brass and steel
tubes, but must not be taken as a basis for design throughout the whole range of
dimensions employed in practice.

The experiments of FarrparrN,f on the other hand, were restricted to tubes of
such relatively small length that he failed to realize the existence of a definite
minimum below which the strength of a tube, however long, will not fall. He also
neglected the possibility of discontinuities in the curve of collapsing pressure at points
where there is a change in the form of the distorted cross-section. In the light of
these facts, figs. 3 and 4 help to explain his well-known formula, by which the
collapsing pressure is given as inversely proportional to the length of the flue; for a
curve of hyperbolic form will represent as well as any other single curve the scattered
points of fig. 4, and trial shows that the hyperbola

is very closely an envelope of the discontinuous curve CBAE in fig. 3, in each case
down to the point of least collapsing pressure.

Validity of Investigation by the Theory of Thin Shells.

One important result of our investigation, which is apparently new, is shown by
