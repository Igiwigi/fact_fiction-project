The facts qui ocular movements as ascertained from this experiment indicate :â€”

1. That both frontal lobes may be removed without any impairment in the
movements of the eyeballs other than a temporary inability to turn them
to the side away from the lesion ;

2. That in addition to the frontal lobes the angular gyri may be removed without
any further impairment in the movements of the eyes or of the eyelids.

The influence of the lesion upon vision will be considered after the experiment
of destroying the pulvinar thalami has been described.

Some further facts upon the symptoms following removal of the frontal lobes are
given in the section devoted to the frontal and pre-frontal systems (Series E).

Destruction of the Pulvinar and Adjacent Portions of the Optic Thalamus.

In this case the operation was performed by removing a considerable portion
of the skull upon the left side; the left cerebral hemisphere was carefully retracted
so as to reveal the corpus callosum ; the posterior half of this structure was divided,
and the lateral ventricle opened, so as to expose the dorsal portion of the optic
thalamus and pulvinar. These were destroyed by the galvano-cautery. That this
