rod R to admit free movement. The only method of escape for the inert gas was thus
diffusion against gravity through this narrow opening. The stress-glide curve for these
conditions is shown in figure 18, compared to that in air at 350° C, and the single point
in figure 15 shows the critical shear stress, which is below that at 17° C, whereas for a

crystal tested in air at 400° C it was much higher. It is possible that a little oxygen
contamination reached the wire and that the point for a clean surface should be even
lower, but the effect of oxygen is clearly established.

The fact that the stress-strain curves for certain of the silver crystals show an increased
slope in the region just below the critical shear stress, a feature which gold crystals never
show, can probably be attributed to oxide-layer effects.

mixture (curve 1), compared with that of a like crystal at 350° C in air (curve 2).

Since the film that produced such considerable mechanical effects was invisible it
seemed possible that, although the crystals were prepared in vacuo, a sufficient oxide layer
might be formed by the action of the atmosphere at room temperature. To test this point
