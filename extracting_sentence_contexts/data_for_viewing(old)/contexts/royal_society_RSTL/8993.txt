view that, even during the exceedingly brief period within which chemical activity
continues, other changes may occur (in addition to the most simple, which follow im-
mediately upon the ignition of the powder) when explosions take place at pressures
such as are developed under practical conditions.

The tendency to incompleteness of metamorphosis, and also to the development of
secondary reactions under fayonrable conditions, appears to be fairly demonstrated by
the results obtained in exploding the different powders in spaces ten times that which
the charges occupied (experiments 8, 1, and 16). It appears, however, that, even
under apparently the most favourable conditions to uniformity of metamorphosis
(namely in explosions produced under high pressures), accidental circumstances may
operate detrimentally to the simplicity and completeness of the reactions. But the
fact, indisputably demonstrated in the course of these researches, that 8uch accidental
yariations in the nature of the changes resulting from the explosion do not, even when }
very considerable, affect the force exerted by fired gunpowder, as demonstrated by the
recorded pressures, &c., indicates that a minute examination into the nature of the pro-
ducts of explosion of powder does not necessarily contribute directly to a comprehen-
s1on of the causes which may operate in modifying the action of fired gunpowder.

G. VOLUME OF THE PERMANENT GASES,

The results of the experiments made to determine the quantity of permanent gases
generated by the explosion of the three service-powders which we have employed are
given in Nos. 53 to 62 and 64.
