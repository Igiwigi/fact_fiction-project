distance above the insertion of the inner covering (Dia. XVIII); the two points
being now at a considerable distance from each other. In none of the stages which I have been able to examine is the seed fully ripe ;
consequently most of the structures which I have to describe are immature. In

portion enclosing the ovule, and two mem-
