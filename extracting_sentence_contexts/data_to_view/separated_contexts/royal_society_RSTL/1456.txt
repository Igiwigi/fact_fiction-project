EXPERIMENT 1,

Two equal wax-candles, well trimmed, and which were
found by a previous experiment to burn with exactly the same
degree of brightness, were placed {ogether, on one side, before
the photometer, and their united light was counterbalanced by
the light of an ArGanD's lamp, well trimmed, and burning
very equally, placed on the other side over against them. The Jamp was placed at the distance of 100 inches from the
field of the photometer, and it was found that the two burn-
ing candles (which were placed as near together as possible,
without their flames affecting each other by the currents of
air they produced), were just able to counterbalance the light
of the lamp at the field of the photometer, when they were
placed at the distance of 60,8 inches from that field. One of
the candles being now taken away and extinguished, the other
was brought nearer to the field of the instrument, till its light
was found to be just able, singly, to counterbalance- the light
of the lamp ; and this was found to happen when it had
arrived at the distance of 43,4 inches.


measuring the comparative Intensities of Light. 87

In this experiment, as the candles burnt with equal bright-
ness, it is evident that the intensities of their united and sIngle
lights were as 2 to 1, and in tliat proportion ought, according
to the assumed theory, the squares of the distances, 60,8 and

' 43-4 to be; and in fact, bo,8 = g696,64 is to 254 = 1889,56
as 2 is to 1 very nearly,

Again, in another experiment, (No. 2.) the distances were,

with two candles = 54 inches. Square = 2916.

with one candle = 58,6. - = 1489,96
Upon another trial (experiment No. g.)

with two candles = 34,6 inches. Square = 281,16

with one candle = 39,7. - = 1576,09
And in the 4th experiment

with two candles = 38,4 inches.
