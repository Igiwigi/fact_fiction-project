respiration had not been applied, in from one-half hour to three hours after the venom
was injected intravenously. When given subcutaneously, death occurred after
1-24 hours, according to the dose employed. In about 10 per cent. of the fatalities
from snake-bite in man, death follows within an hour, and in about 50 per cent.
within seven hours of the bite (WALL).

In all my experiments, as in those of previous writers on cobra poisoning, death
was obviously due to failure of the respiration, for though the heart was very slow
and much dilated, it recovered immediately when artificial inflation was begun.
Special attention was, therefore, directed to the respiration throughout the
experiment. Several investigators have stated that in the beginning the respiration
is accelerated, and have assumed that the centre is stimulated. But this is not a
regular phenomenon, and is in fact exceptional in intravenous poisoning. I have seen
it occasionally after subcutaneous injection, but in view of the local irritation induced
by the poison and also of the increased secretion along the air passages, it is impossible

to state that it arises from direct action on the centre. Far more probably it is a
reflex from the subcutaneous tissues or the result of imperfect a√©ration due to the
partial obstruction of the trachea. In any case it is of small importance.

The first striking change in the respiration observed is the diminution in the depth.
The movement of the abdomen on inspiration becomes less marked and soon is
