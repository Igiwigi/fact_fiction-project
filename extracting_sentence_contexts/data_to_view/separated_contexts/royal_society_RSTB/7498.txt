This assumption was called the ‘linearity assumption’
because it permitted the replacement of the general reaction rate functions by linear ones. This linearity assumption is a serious one. Its justification lies in the fact that the patterns
produced in the early stages when it is valid may be expected to have strong qualitative
similarity to those prevailing in the later stages when it is not. Other, less important, assump-
tions were also made at the beginning of the mathematical theory, but the detailed effects
of these were mostly considered in § 9, and were qualitatively unimportant. The conclusions reached were as follows.
