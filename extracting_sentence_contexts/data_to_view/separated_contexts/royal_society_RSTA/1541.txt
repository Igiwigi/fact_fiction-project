The curves presented for the three threshold values show that the more the image is
far from the threshold, the less the perception of the image is of good quality. Moreover, in the
same time, a greater noise level is required to optimize the system. This fact can be visually confirmed if we compare the images perceived through the detector
for each optimal noise intensity y* corresponding to each of the three considered thresholds,
namely y* =0.4 for Vth=1.05, y* =0.5 for Vth=1.2 and y* =0.65 for Vth =1.4. These images
are reported in figure 5b-d. It is clear that the best perception is achieved for the weakest threshold
and that the quality of the perceived image decreases as the initial image is far from the threshold
detector.
