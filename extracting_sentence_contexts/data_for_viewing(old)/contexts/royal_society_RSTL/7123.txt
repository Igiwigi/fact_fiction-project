724 ON THE INFLUENCE OF PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL AGENTS UPON BLOOD.

In concluding this paper, it was my intention to make 8ome remarks on the reciprocal
action of hematin and atmospheric air; for, as stated in a communication on the con-
dition of ox gen absorbed into the blood during respiration*, which T had the honour
of making to the Royal Society some years ago, the colouring-matter of the blood
appears to pos8ess a more powerful effect in altering the composition of atmospheric air
than any other individual constituent of that liquid. The recent researches of Professor
STokrs, however, cause me to pause before again publishing my views on animal colour-
ing-matters. For the interesting results obtained by that gentleman with the prism,
although in accordance with my facts, may nevertheless induce me to modify my theory ;
not regarding the action, but regarding the nature of these substances. I have hitherto
held the view that all the animal pigments spring from one colourless radical, and that
the difference in tint between hematin, urohematin, and biliverdin was simply due to
the different stages of oxidation of the radical. It would appear, however, from the-
researches of Professor STOKES, that all these substances, although closely allied, are
nevertheless chemically distinct. I consequently prefer reinvestigating the 8ubject
before communicating to the Society the data which are at present before me.
