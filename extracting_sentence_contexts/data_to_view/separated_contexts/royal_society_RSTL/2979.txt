Nothing, for
instance, can be farther removed from the symmetrical form,
and from the dimensions' of the pelvis in the Caucasian 'or
European race, than the same. part in the Negro or Ethi-
opian race. | Of this fact, I shall be able to convince such of
the Fellows of this Society, as are not conversant in these
matters, by exhibiting the most perfect pelvis of a well grown
Negro girl, which I prepared some years ago, in contrast
with that of our mummy, which I likewise carefully dissected,
and - caused to be represented by the same accurate artist
in Plate XX. When subjected to this comparative: test,
the pelvis of our female mummy. will be found to come
nearer to the. beau 7deal of the Caucasian structure, than does
that of women of Europe in. general, and to equal in depth,
amplitude, and rotundity of outlines, the Circassian form.
