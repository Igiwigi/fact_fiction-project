appears to be —

The former (I.) is of very secondary importance to the latter, and the difference
between the iodides, and chlorides, and sulphates is magnified by the fact that in the
case of the iodides alone were the tetra compounds employed.

Inregard to rapidity of action, we find (1) tetramethyl-ammonium-iodide (5 c.c.="5 gr.)
fatal in 5; (2) triethyl-ammonium s8ulphate (20 c.c.) in 17", and tetraethyl-ammonium-
iodide (5 e.c.) in 30”. No 8ymptom of pain occurred in any case after the injection,
nor of physical change in animal. There appeared occasionally a slight loss of co-
ordination, but this may have been, in some cages, due to paralysis. The pupil was
markedly affected in the case of trimethyl-ammonium chloride and tetramethyl-
ammonium-jodide.
