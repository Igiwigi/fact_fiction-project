In fact, in many instances—including with climate change—the reverse is true: mathematical nee)
analyses of the risk associated with climate change have revealed that as uncertainty increases, :
so often does the risk [5,6]. Similarly, potential surprises are more likely to be calamitous than [4

This issue of Philosophical Transactions is dedicated to examining the role of uncertainty in ,
climate change. Given the inherent nature of uncertainty in climate science and especially in the
probabilistic forecasting of future climate change (e.g. temperature, rainfall or sea-level change),
this topic has received much attention and in fact is deeply embedded in the existing literature
in multiple disciplines, from climate science to economics to cognitive science (e.g. [7-10]). This
issue of Philosophical Transactions does not review that embedded literature, but instead explores
the relationship between uncertainty and actionable knowledge. As we show later, the articles in
this issue draw a wide arc that touch on many aspects of this complex question, from physical,
economic and social perspectives.

The notion that uncertainty might be a source of actionable knowledge may appear
counterintuitive. Consider the prediction of floods or other extreme events. Much that is known
about the statistical properties of extreme values, such as floods, is based on the extreme values
for a distribution of water levels over time. Based on knowledge of extreme-value statistics, we
can compute return times of specific flood levels, thereby identifying an event as a ‘1 in 1000 years’
or ‘once ina century’ flood. This provides an indication of future risks, and insurance companies
