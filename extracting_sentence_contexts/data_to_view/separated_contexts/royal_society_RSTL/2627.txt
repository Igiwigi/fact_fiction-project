23, be placed on a conducting
plate c, whose diameter is about half that of the glass; place a similar plate upon
its upper surface, immediately opposite the conducting plate c below, s0 as to give
the glass two moveable coatings ; charge this system by communicating electricity
to the upper plate ; remove the coatings, and place the glass on an insulating support;
if the charged side be now touched with the proof plane, electricity will be freely
taken up. 33. We have here a direct experimental fact, showing that the neutral state of the
proof plate is by no means evidence of the non-existence of electricity upon the in-
terior surface of a charged sphere, and therefore no influence of this kind can be
logically deduced from the experiment in question (21.). Moreover, the theory itself
aszumes, upon certain principles in the 12th section of Newrox, that the action of a
spherical stratum of electricity upon any point placed within it is equal to zero : should
electricity therefore really exist, upon the interior surface of the sphere, it conld not,
if the theory be true, be imparted to a body placed wholly within it. The experi-
ment therefore is in this point of view irrelevant ; but if we take the experiment as a
mere fact abstracted from hypotheses, it must necessarily be considered in connexion
with other facts, such as those above stated (31.)
