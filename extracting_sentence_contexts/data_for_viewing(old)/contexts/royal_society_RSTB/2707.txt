MR. G. MASSEE ON THE ORIGIN OF PARASITISM IN FUNGI. 19

saprophytic fungus into a true parasite was twelve weeks, and the number of
generations of the fungus amounted to sixteen. The host-plant during the experi-
ments was growing in a house where the day temperature ranged between 70° and
80° F., falling during the night to 60° F.

The actual proofs that the Trichothecium had become a true parasite on the
Begonia, consisted in the presence of a copious development of mycelium in inter-
cellular spaces of the leaf, and the occurrence of numerous short, special branches
or haustoria in the cell cavities; and also the fact that specialised branches or
sporophores, originating from the intercellular mycelium, passed through the stomata
and produced fruit in the air. The portions of the leaf infested with the fungus
eventually sunk below the general level of the surface, became brown, and the cells
collapsed.

The check sowings of spores on Begonia leaves not injected, always ended without
showing any appearance of parasitism, and never produced fruit; neither could I
discover any traces of mycelium in the tissues of the leaf at these points where the
spores were sown.

Returning to the results of the experiments made with the spores of Stachybotrywm
lobulatum and Torula herbarum. No signs of injury to the host-plant followed
