improper. As it is therefore ſuppoſed uſeful to at-
tend to the proportions of theſe parts in many diſ-
orders, and even to take indications of cure from
them, it has been an obje& with thoſe who have
made experiments on the blood, to determine the
circumſtances on which its more perfect ſeparation
into theſe two parts depends ; it being obvious, that
till this be done, our inferences from their propor-
tions will be liable to conſiderable fallacies. Two of
the lateſt writers on this ſubje& agree, that if the
blood, after being taken from a vein, be ſet in a
cold place, it will not eaſily ſeparate, and that a
moderate warmth is neceſſary : this is a fact that is
evinced by daily experience. They likewiſe fay,
that the heat ſhould be leſs than that of the animal,
or than 98* of Fahrenheit's thermometer; and that
if freſh blood be received into a cup, and that cup
put into water heated to 98*, it will not ſeparate ;
nay, they even fay, that it will not coagulate ; but
this, I am perſuaded from experiments, is ill-founded.
