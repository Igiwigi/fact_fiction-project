electric currents. As, however, our analytical equations for an extended mediun
involve (u, v, w), the current according to a volume specification, while the mole
currents are minute whirls not involving continuous flow in any direction, it i
necessary to determine the volume specification of currents that shall be their equi-
valent when the element of volume is so great as to contain a large number of whirl
of which the average effect only is required. Such a specification is clearly possible;
and when we bear in mind that the volumes occupied by the cores of the whirling
electrons form only an excessively small part of the total space, it is also clear that
the type of magnetic force which represents the velocity of the incompressible wther
must be a circuital one, that is, the magnetic induction of Maxwet. There is
difficulty in verifying by direct analysis that the magnetic force at a point due to a
system of molecular currents is the same as the magnetic induction due to the equi
valent magnet ; in fact it is shown (previous paper, § 120) that the said force is equal
to the curl of a vector potential

| (Bd/dz — Cdjdy, Cd/da — Ad/dz, Adjdy — Ba/dee) r=? dr,

the same vector potential from which the magnetic induction of the equivalent magnet
is derived. ;
Now let us consider the projections of the molecular circuits parallel to the plane of
xy : let these projections swell out in area until they come into contact filling up the
whole plane, the currents round them being reduced in the same ratio as their areas —
are increased. Along each edge common to two circuits there will be a differential
current flowing, and by making the enlarged circuits rectangular of the form da 8y, i
becomes clear that the aggregate of these differential currents make up a volume
