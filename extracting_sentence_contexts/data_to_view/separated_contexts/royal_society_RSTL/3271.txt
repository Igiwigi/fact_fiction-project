The experiment was tried repeatedly upon a small scale, and the difficulties which
presented themselves successively surmounted, till at length a speculum of three feet
aperture was completed, which bears distinctly a high power. The evil most to be apprehended in this construction, was unequal contraction and
expansion in the different changes of atmospheric temperature ; that, however, seems
to have been sufficiently guarded against, as I have never succeeded in detecting the
slightest change of figure. It is therefore highly probable, that specula very much
larger may be constructed upon this plan, and that, in fact, by repeating a number
of operations, each on a scale perfectly manageable, we may obtain a reflecting surface
the most brilliant, and at the same time as large as can eyer be usefully employed in
astronomical researches. I will now proceed with the details of the construction of
the three-feet speculum. I bad previously ascertained that an alloy consisting of
about 2:75 of copper to 1 of zinc, gave the same contractions and expansions as spe-
culum metal ; it was necessary, however, to repeat the measurement with care, using
the identical materials which were to be employed in the construction of the specu-
lum.
