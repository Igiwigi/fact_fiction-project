Tt weighed, before it was
cut for the purpose of determining its mineralogical nature, a little oyer 1% oz,
It is brown, somewhat rough, heavy, and hard. Tk is hardly, however, to be
called * flat on one side,” as Leguat describes those he had the opportunity of
observing. In connexion with this fact, however, it may be remarked that the
bird with whose remains it was associated appears to have heen young.*

We have to thank Professor Bonney, M.A., F.R.S., for the following report on
the microscopic structure and mineralogical composition of the stone ;—

« This rock externally presents considerable resemblance to a dolerite. Such it
is proved to be on microscopic examination; the slide shewing a erystalline
mixture of plagioclase felspar, augite, olivine, and a peroxide of iron (? hematite),
The plagioclase is well preseryed ; the sections are commonly about six times as
long as wide, and exhibit the characteristic twinning ; probably it is labradorite,
Enclosures of opacite, augite (?), and other microliths, with minute gas-cavities, are
frequent in 8ome erystals, rare in others; colours with polarizing apparatus fairly
bright. The augite in the sections is of a pale puce-brown colour, rather rough in
texture, and with the nicols fairly rich coloured.
