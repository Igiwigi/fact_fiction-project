discharge, which had previously served to convey the influence of the lithocyst to the
undivided parts of the gonocalyx. Nevertheless we must bear in mind that this
deduction is 8upported by no histological evidence, and that it is, moreover, very difficult
to reconcile with the fact that some specimens of Aurelia aurita endure 80 enormous
an amount of the most severe forms of section without suffering loss of physiological
continuity between any of their parts.

The deduction also appears difficult to reconcile with another fact, viz. that in 8ome
cases (which, however, are greatly in the minority) the blocking of contractile waves
in spiral strips admits, after a time, of being overcome, the contractile wayes again passing
from the strip into the gonocalyx as freely as they did before the section reached the
point at which the blocking occurred, and this occasionally two or three times in suc-
cession. I think, however, that there is a theory by which all these paradoxical facts
may be reconciled; and s0 at, the present stage of my inquiries I provisionally accept
the hypothesis of there being present in the locomotor system of Aurelia aurits more
or less definitely integrated lines of discharge. But, in making this statement, it is
almost needless to add that I wish a marked distinction to be drawn between the certainty
' of the hypothesis and that of the facts from which it is deduced.

Blocking of contractile waves in strips may also be caused by making a system of
