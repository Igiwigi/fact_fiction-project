coupled atmosphere-ocean model forced by boundary conditions appropriate for
the last glacial period. In this study, a small sinusoidal freshwater perturbation
with a period of 1470 years was applied to the North Atlantic, along with
stochastic freshwater fluxes (with amplitudes comparable to present-day
interannual variability). In response, the simulated AMOC displayed SR,
alternating between stadial and interstadial circulation states with a distribution
of transition times that compared favourably with those of DO events in the
GRIP ice core. Stochastic resonance could be achieved with realistic noise levels
yecause the modelled interstadial state is easily excited from the stadial state by
freshwater perturbations to the North Atlantic (Ganopolski & Rahmstorf 2001;
Schmittner et al. 2002). In Ganopolski & Rahmstorf (2002), the 1470-year
periodic forcing was some external perturbation of unknown provenance; using
he same model, Braun et al. (2005) suggested that the forcing may in fact arise
hrough the superposition of 87- and 210-year Gleissberg and DeVries solar
cycles. When forced by a linear combination of North Atlantic freshwater
forcings with these periodicities (or a more realistic modulation of the 11-year
solar cycle by the Gleissberg cycle), the model responds with a 1470-year almost-
periodic alternation between stadial and interstadial states (for certain forcing
parameter ranges). That the modelled AMOC should respond on millennial
ime scales to this shorter time-scale forcing was attributed to a combination
of strongly nonlinear dynamics and the long intrinsic AMOC adjustment
ime scales.

Using an idealized coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea-ice model, Timmermann
et al. (2003) suggested a variation on the SR mechanism for driving cycles of DO
