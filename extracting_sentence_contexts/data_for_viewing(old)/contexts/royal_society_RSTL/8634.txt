= From these Tables we learn a fact of high importance, viz. that of the whole annual
= oscillation of the atmospheric pressure over the Gangetic plain, which may be taken as
x the measure of the forces that produce the alternating monsoons of India (up to the
S equator, where the pressure is nearly inyariable), nearly one half is due to an alteration
= of the density of that stratum of the atmosphere which lies between 400 and 5000 feet
Z (Goalpara and Shillong), more than two thirds to that, of the stratum between 400 and
Q 7000 feet (Goalpara and Darjeeling), and nearly two thirds to that between 800 and
7000 feet in the North-western Provinces (Roorkee and Simla). If for the actual
annual barometric range at Goalpara and Roorkee we substitute their equivalents at
8ea-leyel, as given in Table VIIL., viz. 0:445 inch at Goalpara and 0-595 at Roorkee, and
increase the range of the yalues of b,â€”b, by a corresponding amount, then the oscillation
below Shillong becomes more than one half, and that below Darjeeling and Simla nearly
8even tenths of the whole.
