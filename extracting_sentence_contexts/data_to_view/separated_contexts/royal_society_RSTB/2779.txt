Within the living Psilotacese, however, the higher possibilities
have not been realised in the form of permanently increased complexity; such
branchings of sporophylls, and formation of extra sporangiophores as those described
by Tromas, do not appear normally perpetuated in any known race of plants. The
family may be regarded as having in these respects unrealised morphological
possibilities of further amplification, rather than reminiscences of a more extensive
development in the past. The fact that such variations as those above discussed exist in the spore-bearing
organs of the Psilotacew, throws a fresh interest over the variability of number of
sporangiophores and sporangia borne by the Sphenophyllee. One of the most
remarkable features of these fossils is the difference in number and character of the
spore-bearing organs inserted on the apparently superposed leaf-verticils. *

The Psilotaceee and Sphenophyllee resemble one another in certain anatomical
features.
