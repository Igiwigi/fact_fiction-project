which is satisfied by u=y7" and by u=y7', but, as is evident from its unhomogeneous
form, not by u=C,y7'+C,y77%. In this case, in fact, the condition y7"+y7"=0 not
being fulfilled, the primary differential equation (TI) suffers no change in the form of its
general solution. Mr. Harrer's reults are in effect transformations of (10) and (11). Since wy,
