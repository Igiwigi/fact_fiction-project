in the thorite, but that it had been gradually carried down mechanically or by mass-
action rather than chemically, by the numerous operations it had undergone before
getting ib to the final stage. Therefore a fresh quantity of thorite was extracted with
hydrochloric acid. The solution was precipitated with potassic sulphate, taking the
usual precautions to secure complete precipitation. A bulky precipitate ensned, which
contained the thorina and cerium earths. These were separated and tested, and
found to give only a faint citron band.

35. The s0lution of earthy sulphates soluble in potassic sulphate was precipitated
with ammonie oxalate. The precipitate ignited with sulphuric acid, and tested in
a radiant matter tube, gave the citron spectrum with great brilliancy (25, 33).

Chemical facts connected with the citron body.

36. Certain chemical facts concerning the behaviour of the sought-for element
which came out, during the course of the tentative trials already described had
considerably narrowed the list amongsb which it might probably be found. All the
evidence tended to show that it belongs to the group of earthy metals, consisting of
aluminium, beryllium, thorium, zirconium, cerium, lanthanum, didymium, and the
yttrium family, together with titanium, tantalum, and niobium. The sought-for earth
is insoluble in excess of potash (25) ; this excludes aluminium and beryllium. It is
not precipitated by continued boiling with sodic thiosulphate (17, 27) ; this excludes
aluminium, thorium, and zirconium. Fused with acid potassic sulphate, the resulting
compound is readily soluble in cold water ; this excludes tantalum and niobium.
