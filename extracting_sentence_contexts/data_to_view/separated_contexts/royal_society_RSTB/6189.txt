That he associated the hernia
with crest cannot be doubted. It is important that he particularly emphasized
the great differences in the deformation of the skull to be found in different breeds. â€œFrom the foregoing facts we see in how astonishing a manner some of the
bones of the skull vary in Crested fowls. The protuberance may certainly
be called in one sense a monstrosity, as being wholly unlike anything observed
in nature ; but as in ordinary cases it is not injurious to the bird, and as
it is strictly inherited, it can hardly in another sense be called a mon-
strosity. A series may be formed.commencing with the black-boned Silk
fowl, which has a very small crest with the skull beneath penetrated only
by a few minute orifices, but with no other change in its structure ; and from
