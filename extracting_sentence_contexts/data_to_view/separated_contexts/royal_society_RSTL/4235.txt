WHEWELL ON THE 'TIDES OF THE PACIFIC,

probably be the case in other instances where the cotidal lines affect the same con-
verging form, and where the tide in the central part of the sea vanishes. Materials for a Tide Map of the Pacific.

24. The materials which I formerly employed in my © Es8ay towards a First Ap-
proximation to a Map of Cotidal Lines,” were principally the following :—the collec-
tion of the facts then known, given in the fourth yolume of Laranvs's Astronomy ;
Books of Astronomy and Navigation, and Sailing Directions, as Norte's Epitome of
Navigation, Purpy's Memoir on the Atlantic Ocean, his Memoir on the Ethiopic or
South Atlantic, and his Columbian Navigator : Nautical Surveys, as the Surveys
of the Australian coasts by Captains FLixnvers and Kixs, and of Patagonia by the
latter officer; and the Survey of the Pacific by Captain Bezcney; also foreign
materials of the same kind, as MaLaseina's Voyage, and RovssNn's Survey of Brazil :
to which may be added the © Remark Books” of various ships, which I was allowed
to consult at the Admiralty, Memoirs relative to particular places, and other miscel-
laneous sources of information.

25, I have more recently collected other materials of the same kind, which I will
briefly describe. They are partly gathered from books : for instance,—

1818, 1819, 1820, par M. L. ps FreycixneT.
