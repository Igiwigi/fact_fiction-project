[In the most usual problems W is of the form T-+U, where T

the earth, as affected by the earth's rotation \]

Let us now suppose that the system (E.) is to be tr:

ansformed by the introduction
of the m independent coordinates & &,, +. Â£,, and of the new conjugate variables

And let it be required to investigate a theorem by
means of which the transformation may be effected without recur
