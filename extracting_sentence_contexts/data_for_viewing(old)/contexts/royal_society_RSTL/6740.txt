months. At the end of this period small spots of cryptogamic vegetation were visible
Zo the surface of the sand; but the whole yielded only 0-74 milligramme of Nitrogen.
FI Again, Borss1xGaurLT found that unless the ashes used as manure were burnt until
Enearly all apparent traces of carbon were destroyed, they were liable to retain more or
Hess and sometimes material amounts of Nitrogen. In some imperfectly burnt ashes
Eeyanides, and in some, ferrocyanides were found ; in others the Nitrogen scemed to exist
neither of these conditions.
£2 With regard to the much larger gain of Nitrogen indicated in his early experiments
free air (1837 and 1838) than in those made more recently, Bovss1NGAULT remarks
Athat the result may be partly due to the comparatively defective methods of analysis at
the early date, and partly also to the distilled water used for watering the plants con-
taining some ammonia. For, at the time of his first experiments, he was not aware of
the fact, since learned in his analyses of rain and other waters, that water distilled
from that which contained minute quantities of ammonia did not come over free from
It until about two-fifths of the whole had been drawn off.

It will be observed that, in most of the experiments of BoussINGAULT thus far passed
in review, he limited the supply of Nitrogen to the plants to that contained in the seed
own, and to that which they could obtain from the atmosphere, either washed or un-
