sporangia, and in the number of spores produced from each. Meanwhile, the length
of receptacle and number of sporangia increases, so that, as we shall see later, the
total output of spores is approximately maintained, but their maturing may be
spread over a longer time in accordance with the powers of the less efficient assimi-
lating apparatus.

Taking the facts thus acquired from Ferns with simultaneous or basipetal sori, and
mostly with oblique annulus, they show that within circles of near affinity there may
be a wide margin of variation in the number of sporangia in the sorus, and succession
of their production, in the size of the sporangia, thickness of stalk, and in output of
spores per sporangium,

But these are among the very characters by which the Marattiaceze are dis-
tinguished from Leptosporangiate Ferns. Though naturally it is not possible to
establish an exact numerical proportion of spore-output to other morphological
characters, still the figures above given so far follow parallel to other structural
details, such as size and thickness of stalk, that the spore-enumerations may be taken
as a fair indication of them, The several families may be laid out on these grounds
as probable sequences, and we may see in those with larger spore-output a suggestion
