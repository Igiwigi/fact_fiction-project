EWART ON THE ASCENT OF WATER IN TREES.

is almost constantly of the kind indicated, and produces an apparent temporary fall
of osmotic pressure, though not a tangible and measurable one. It is more correct therefore to use the term “ plasmolysing concentration” for
results obtained in this manner, and a series of observations on the plasmolytic
concentrations for leaf cells of species of Acacia, Eucalyptus, and Grrevillea taken
from 1-12 metres height show that the concentration may vary from 2-6 per cent. KNO, in one and the same plant, that the variations between leaves at the same
level is at first as great as between leaves at different levels, and that the size
of the cell and the age of the leaf appear to influence the plasmolytic concen-
tration more than any other factors apart from food storage and assimilation.*
Hence this promising line of investigation into the problem of the ascent of sap
must be abandoned as inaccurate and misleading,

In criticising the conclusions based upon the experimental results in my former
paper, Professor LArMort suggests that the main part of the ascent of sap may be by
a chain of osmotic actions from vessel to vessel, and that the weight of liquid in
each vessel may rest on the base of the vessel, so that no summation to a high total
pressure occurs, That no high total pressure or tension appears at any point in a
tall tree is certain, but the explanation given by Professor Larmor does not coincide
with the facts. In involves three assumptions:—(1) That the sap increases in
concentration upwards; (2) that the vessels contain semi-permeable membranes ;
(3) that the weight of the separate columns can be supported on the permeable
bases of the vessels without being transmitted through them. The last-named
could only be the case if the membranes were impermeable, when all upward flow
would cease, and any decrease of their permeability simply increases the resistance to
flow, and hence also the pressure required to produce a given rate of flow upwards or
downwards.
