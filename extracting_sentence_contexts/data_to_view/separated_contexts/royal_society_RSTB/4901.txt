in the “blood volume.” While therefore the results of other methods are less reliable in Experiment 2 than in
Experiment 1, those of the Hartridge method are more so. (8) There was no evidence of increased formation of red blood cells as evidenced by
the reticulated counts, a fact which may have to do with the fall in blood volume on
the third day. (4) On the third day there was a drop in the ‘“ blood volume.” It was then by the
Hartridge method (the only one which gave concordant results) about 1 litre in excess
of that at the commencement of the experiment.
