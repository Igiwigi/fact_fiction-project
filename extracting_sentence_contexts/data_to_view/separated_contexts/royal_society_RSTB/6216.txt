The
shape of the leaves and their manner of arrangement on the shoot are practically
the only criteria which have been used in distinguishing one species from another. As a result some of the species are exceedingly ill defined and the nomenclature
and synonymy of the species in the genus are very involved. A good deal of confusion
is due to the fact that in the fossil Equisetales as in the fossil Lycopodiales the leaves
on the different orders of branches on one and the same plant may show considerable
differences. The leaves on the main axis or large branches of Annularia spheno-
phylloides ZENKER are quite different in size and shape from those found on the
ultimate branches. The best account of the genus Annularia and the systematic
relations of its species is given by Joncmans (1911 and 1914, pp. 5, 235).
