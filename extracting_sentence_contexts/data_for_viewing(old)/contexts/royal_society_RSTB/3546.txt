to be also a ganglionic plate, connected with the deeper part of the lateral edge ot
the medullary plate, from which it extends outwards under cover of the ectoderm of
the head. It is, in fact, the acustico-facial ganglionic Anlage.

Caudally to the last-mentioned ganglion-rudiment, we also find, in both of the
specimens (figs. 73 and 74), a narrow arcuate band, or strip, distinguished by its
opacity. In fig. 74 this appears as if directly connected with the edge of the
medullary plate, a short distance behind the acustico-facial ganglion ; whilst, behind,
it appears to merge itself in the paraxial zone, in the region of the most anterior
somite. This appearance is, however, illusory. The strand in question is ganglionic
and its connection with the lateral edge of the medullary plate is far more extensive
and continuous than fig. 74 would lead one to suppose. In point of fact, the narrow
opaque curved strand there visible, is only the somewhat thicker convex outer edge
of an elongated ganglionic plate, which is the representative of the glossopharyngeus-
vagus ganglion-complex. The more mesial portion of this elongated ganglionic plate
is not wholly lacking, but consists of much looser and thinner cell-material, which
therefore offers no increase of opacity when viewed by transmitted light.

When the ganglionic rudiments above enumerated are viewed as a series it will
© appear that they may be regarded as differentiations of, or outgrowths from, a
“neural crest,” which may presumably have been originally continuous, from the
anterior limit of the Trigeminus ganglion-plate, backwards into the spinal region.
Here, in the cephalic region, it is definitely discontinuous at two points. There is
a marked hiatus between the Trigeminus and Acustico-facialis, and a lesser one
