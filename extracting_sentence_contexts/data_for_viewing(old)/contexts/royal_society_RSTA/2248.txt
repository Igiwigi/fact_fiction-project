3. Shaping the development of mathematics

The Fields Medals, with an age limit of 40 for the winners, were instituted with two lofty goals in
mind: (i) to recognize pioneering work by brilliant young mathematicians and (ii) to encourage
these young researchers to continue to influence the growth of mathematics. The Fields Medallists
have lived up to these great expectations. The SASTRA Ramanujan Prize has a more stringent age
limit of 32, and so has recognized brilliant mathematicians even earlier in their careers.

It is no exaggeration to say that the winners of the SASTRA Ramanujan Prizes have also shaped
the development of mainstream mathematics and will continue to do so in the years ahead. The
fact that the SASTRA laureates have subsequently won major prizes with a hallowed tradition


is a testimony to this; for instance, Fields Medal Winners Manjul Bhargava (2014), Peter Scholze 0 |
(2018) and Akshay Venkatesh (2018) were all earlier SASTRA Prize Winners.
