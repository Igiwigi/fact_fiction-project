369 The later stages of the Welwitschia embryo and the details of the whole
development of the pro-embryo of Gnetum must be investigated before any close
comparison between the embryonic stages of the three genera can be instituted. But
in so far as the facts are known, they indicate a closer degree of affinity between
Welwitschia and Gnetum than between either of these genera and Ephedra. In Ephedra, the oospore-nucleus undergoes three series of divisions, and each of the
eight resulting nuclei may organise a cell which gives rise to a pro-embryo. In some
species of Gnetum, the oospore is said to behave in a somewhat similar manner.*
