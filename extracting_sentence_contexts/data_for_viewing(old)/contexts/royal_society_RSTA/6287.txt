classification theorems of their earlier work [11] to the realm of mi. There, the authors defined the
ordinal 03(T) as the least ordinal w such that D(q) is illfounded for some pre-dilator D such that
TE DIL(D).

Accordingly, Ok(T) is defined as the collection of all dilators D such that P(D) is well-founded
for every T-ptyx P, i.e. every recursive (2-)pre-ptyx P such that T+ PTYX2(P). Thus, Ok(T) serves


as a measure of how close T is to being [1}-sound: the larger O}(T) is, the harder one needs to
search to find a counterexample to the /1}-soundness of T.

The authors begin by recalling various concepts and results from the theory of ptykes. While
these facts were already explicitly or implicitly covered in the work of Girard [61] and Girard-
Ressayre [62], proofs are included for convenience. Seven classification theorems are proved, all
recasting various soundness properties of T in terms of whether certain dilators D belong to O}(T).
As mentioned in the article, these results all extend to the other classes 1} without much trouble.

The last section of the article has a more exploratory nature and raises the question of
characterizing the sets of dilators of the form Ok(T) for some recursively enumerable extension
T of ACAy. Partial progress is made by characterizing the sets of the form O1(T) at for some
recursively enumerable extension T of ACAg, but the problem is open otherwise. Unlike the results
of the earlier sections, this argument relies on the work of the authors [63] on mi} proof-theoretic
analysis, and thus, the corresponding questions for o} 44(T) and ol n)ya AY are open. The
