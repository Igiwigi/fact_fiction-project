Transcranial random noise stimulation (Â¢RNS) of the
cortex has then been introduced as a convenient solution to take into account such level of neural
processing [50]. By performing a visual detection task to different subjects, it has been shown that
exciting the visual cortex with tRNS enhances the detection of a specific stimuli, more precisely
a sinusoidal luminance pattern within a Gaussian envelope in a circular aperture. In fact, the
psychophysics experiments carried out by Van der Groen et al. consisted in finding in which
of two separated sequences of images this specific visual stimuli had appeared. To analyse the
influence of noise, they have estimated the percentage of correct responses in the cases where
noise was directly added to the visual stimuli and when tRNS was used. Moreover, two different
stimulations hypothesis were considered: subthreshold and suprathreshold stimuli.
