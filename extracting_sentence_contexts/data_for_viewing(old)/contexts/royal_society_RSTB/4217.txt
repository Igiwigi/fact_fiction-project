intermediate form to those of the babies. The eyes of the mother are in form and

pigmentation absolutely uniform and similar to the four baby-eyes, dark brown.
There is no facial asymmetry. The shape of the ears is the same as in baby B but
the lobules are adherent as in baby A.

Owing to the whirl-point of the hair being different-sided in the babies, the mother
astonished us by the fact that in her case it was quite in the middle of the scalp.
The use of combing did not leave a nice whirl as it was found in the twins, a main
line, quite on the sagittal suture, going straight on backwards, dividing into two
secondary lines; the left of these takes a direction to the lateral side lower down than
the other going on the right. The lines and furrows in the hands are like those of
the children. The feet are normally formed, without any pathological condition.

The conclusion is that the male twins under examination are very similar to each
other and also to their mother. No essential differences were to be found.
