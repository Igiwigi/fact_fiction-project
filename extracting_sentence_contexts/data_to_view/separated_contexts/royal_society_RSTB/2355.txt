At the proximal end, as shown in tangential section in phot. 14, the whole “seed”
is narrower than elsewhere, and the sporangium smaller, compared with the sporophyll
and integument. The micropyle extends to this extremity, but the attachment
between sporangium and sporophyll is missed. The facts already detailed show that the integument of Lepidocarpon Lomaxi was
a wall of tissue which grew up on either side of the sporangium from the upper part

of the sporophyll-pedicel. Along the greater part of the length of the pedicel the
insertion of the integument was approximately marginal, but towards the distal
extremity this was not the case, the margin of the sporophyll projecting far beyond
the base of the integument. We have also found that the micropylar opening
between the upper edges of the integument had the form of a long crevice, extending
practically the whole length of the seed, in the radial direction.
