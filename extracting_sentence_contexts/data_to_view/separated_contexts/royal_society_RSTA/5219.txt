The combustion of each layer produces both heat and at the same time the
work necessary to compress the following layer——that is to say, the layer loses on this
score just as much heat as it gained by its own compression. ‘The whole proceeds, as
far as the elevation of temperature is concerned, precisely as if we had operated under
constant pressure.” On the facts of the case there is no dispute. The gas is exploded
in a closed vessel. Each layer is compressed before being fired; after firing it
compresses the layer beyond it.
