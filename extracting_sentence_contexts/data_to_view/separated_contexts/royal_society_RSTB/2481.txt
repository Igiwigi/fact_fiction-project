IX. PHystoLocicaL CoNsIDERATIONS. It is obviously beyond the scope of this paper to attempt any theory of vision or of
colour perception, or even to see to what extent the facts which we have recorded
can be brought into harmony with existing views. It will not be possible to do more
than call attention, and that only in a very cursory manner, to some few among many
points which have specially impressed me in the course of this work. In referring to a number of our text-books I have been struck with the difference
between the explanation given for the ophthalmoscopic appearance and the descrip-
tions of the eye which underlie the theories of vision.
