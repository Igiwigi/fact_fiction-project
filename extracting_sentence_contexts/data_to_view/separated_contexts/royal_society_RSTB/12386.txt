In Jansson
[8], | argued that we can provide a solution to the problem of
directionality when it comes to law-based explanations by
focusing on the lawâ€™s conditions of application. This solution
does not, however, cover the types of non-causal explanations
that we seem to find in network explanations where topologi-
cal properties are doing the explanatory work. To start to cover
such network explanations, I need to say a little more about the
schematic structure of explanatory models of physical facts that
Iam working with. I take the process of giving a model expla-
nation to have as a target a dependence external to the model
(type 4) and to have three steps that are of interest when captur-
ing the directionality of network explanations (dependence of
types 1-3) (figure ps

First, we can ask how features of the model selected vary
with features of the explanatory target (type 1). Here, the
model's conditions of application are crucial.
