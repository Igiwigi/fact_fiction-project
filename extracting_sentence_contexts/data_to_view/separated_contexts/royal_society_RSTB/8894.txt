This imposes a strong correlation among the pixel intensities,
which can be used to determine the snapshot orientations, and
thus determine the three-dimensional structure [16,18,30,31]. Specifically, a snapshot consisting of p pixels can be represented
as a p-dimensional vector, with each component representing
the intensity value at a pixel. The fact that the intensities are a
function of only three parameters means that the p-dimensional
vector tips all lie on a three-dimensional hypersurface
(‘manifold’) in the p-dimensional space of intensities
(figure 1). This manifold is an expression of the correlated
way in which the pixel intensities change with the particle
orientation. In fact, each point on the manifold represents a
snapshot from a specific object orientation.
