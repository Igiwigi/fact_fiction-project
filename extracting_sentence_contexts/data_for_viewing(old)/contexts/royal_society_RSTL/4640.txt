while Ligpic's view would characterize them as

H,N+Y,
X denoting generally an organic compound containing carbon, hydrogen, and pos
sibly nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur, while Y expresses an organic oxide, chloride, &c.,
minus 1 equiv. of oxygen, chlorine, &c.

Objections have been raised against either theory, and the opinions of chemists
have remained divided. Li1gB16 has not returned any more to the subject, but Bzr-
ZELIUs took frequent occasion, both in his *Annual Report and in the several editions
of his © Trait6,” to defend his notion by the skilful interpretation of every new fact
which was elaborated by the progress of the science. The weight of his authority
bas not been without influence, for it cannot be denied that Bzrzeirvs's view has
become more and more generally accepted, especially since a series of comparative
researches, conducted of late upon the derivatives of the salts of ammonia and of
organic bases, appeared to give fresh support to this theory. These experiments
pointed out that the elimination of hydrogen from organic bases and ammonia is by
no means confined to one equivalent; oxalate of ammonia, which by the loss of 2 equiys.
of water is converted into oxamide, when deprived of the whole of its hydrogen in
