on this insect in its second skin, I am doubtful whether the rate of pulsation be not
in reality greatest, during the earlier life of the larya, before it has thrown off its first
skin, because this was really the case in all the obseryations, if we except only two
which were made on the afternoon of the same day, when the larya was at about the
age of two hundred and seventeen hours. These obseryations being excepted, it will
be seen from Table IX. that the rate of pulsation is gradually diminished from the
earliest period of the larya state until the insect has changed into a pupa,â€”that while
the rate of pulsation within a few hours after the insect has left the egg varies from
seventy-five to ninety, and in its second skin, or at an average age of about two hun-
dred and forty hours, it is but very little lower, it becomes in its third reduced to an
average of seyenty-five, in its fourth to less than sixty, in the middle period of its
fifth to a maximum of fifty-five, and the latter period of the same to scarcely more
than thirty-two pulsations per minute. These are interesting facts as connected with
the power which the inseet possesses of generating heat. It is, as before stated, at
about the middle period of its fifth state or condition as a larva, when it is feeding
most voraciously, that the insect is able to generate the greatest amount of heat.

Although it will be seen from the additional facts about to be stated that both during
Sleeping and activity, when most vigorous as a larya, as also when passing into the
enfeebled condition of a pupa, there is a coincident and correspondent activity or
diminution in the rate of pulsation with the increase of motion, respiration, or diges-
tion; yet the primary source of the development of heat is not dependent upon the
velocity or rapidity of the circulation, since the period in which there is the greatest
rapidity of circulation is that in which the larya is least able to generate and maintain
its greatest amount of temperature. Another circumstance which tends greatly to
