distance above the insertion of the inner covering (Dia. XVIII); the two points
being now at a considerable distance from each other.

In none of the stages which I have been able to examine is the seed fully ripe ;
consequently most of the structures which I have to describe are immature. In
particular, there was much difficulty involved in
the investigation of the course of the vascular
bundles, owing to their xylem being not yet
lignified : in fact, many of them consist only of
thin-walled cells arranged in radial rows. The
following description applies to the oldest stages
examined.

The outer covering is composed of a thicker

branous wings (fig. 6, Plate 17).

The thicker portion consists of several layers
of isodiametric cells with thick walls, inter-

the outer side by a thick-walled, small-celled,
