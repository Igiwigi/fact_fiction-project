It is therefore possible that the outcome-uncertain projections were more difficult for
respondents to comprehend. Lack of comprehension may therefore be an alternative explanation
for respondents having weaker responses to outcome-uncertain projections. However, differences
in comprehension between the two conditions should be limited by the fact that the graphs
presented to respondents were identical across conditions (except for the blue line expressing the
uncertainty). Furthermore, all respondents successfully completed comprehension items prior to
starting the survey. As this study is the first to have demonstrated a beneficial effect of time-uncertain presentation
(to our knowledge), and in the light of the limitations addressed above, future work should seek


to replicate the finding.
