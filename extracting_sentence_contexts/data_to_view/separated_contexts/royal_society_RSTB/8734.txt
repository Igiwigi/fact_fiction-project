The problem stems from that rather neglected aspect
of language, syntagmatic contrast—one which has always
been a fly in the ointment of attempts to impose on the analysis
of speech the kind of cyclicity or rhythmicity of other activities
such as walking or chewing [33]. Spoken English is akin to traf-
fic flow, where we might expect, at any observation point and
moment, an effectively random sequence of lorry-car-car-lorry-
lorry-car-van-lorry-van-car-car-car rather than a rhythmically
alternating lorry-car-lorry-car-lorry-car. This is despite the
fact that a very straightforward way, in addition to developing
strong stress, exists for a language to achieve the putative goal
of contrastive rhythm, namely to incorporate the following into
its phonology: a constraint on stressed syllables all to have the
same structure, e.g. CVV (one consonant plus a long vowel); a
constraint on unstressed syllables all to have the same structure
as each other, e.g. CV (one consonant and a short vowel); and a
constraint on the foot (the domain of a stressed syllable plus
any following unstressed syllables) to be disyllabic.
