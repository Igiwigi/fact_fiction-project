It is now fully establisghed that Stygmaria ficoides, to which these rootlets belong, is
the root of Sigillaria, as well as of Lepidodendron. The structure of these rootlets
therefore adds an additional link to the long chain of evidence, indicating the close
affinity of the Sigillarie with the Lycopods. But there is yet another feature in these exogenous Lepidodendroid stems which
may prove to have some bearing upon the problem of evolution : this is, the presence
of numerous barred cells in the medullary rays, to which fact T have already made a
slight reference. In my memoir, Part II. (Plate 27, fig. 23, a, p. 236), I called atten-
tion to the existence of snch cells in the triangular spaces that appear to project out-
wards from the medullary sheath, and are intercalated between the inner extremities
of the vascular wedges of the exogenous zone ; and in the same memoir (p. 238)
