At first sight it looks as though such a muscle would function by pulling
the terga together. But supposing these two plates were kept apart by some rigid fulcrum
above the muscle, then the latter, while pulling the lower ends of the plates together,
would at the same time pull outwards the upper parts. That this is what in fact occurs soon
became evident from the study of sections transverse to the terga and longitudinal to the

peduncle (figure 2). A fulcrum occurs which is formed by the carina and a modification
of the body wall.


OF THE PEDUNCULATE BARNACLE LITHOTRYA 93 The outer covering of the peduncle consists of a relatively thick, laminated chitin layer
covered on the outside by a thin cuticular layer.*
