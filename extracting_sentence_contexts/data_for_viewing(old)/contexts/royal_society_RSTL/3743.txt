sessed a line of minimum magnetization, have been placed in those moulds and
pressed closely together in the direction of the said line: the approximation of the
particles thus effected has converted the direction spoken of from one of minimum
into one of maximum magnetization, It would be difficult for me to say how many
diamagnetic bodies I have submitted to compression, some massive, some in a state
of powder, but in no single instance haye I discovered an exception to the law that
the line of compression of purely diamagnetic bodies is the line of strongest diamag-
netization. The approximation of diamagnetic particles is therefore accompanied
by an augmentation of their power, instead of a diminution of it, as supposed by the
theory of M. WeBER.

Any bypothesis which involves the idea of the diminution of the diamagnetic action
of a body by the approximation of its particles, is, I believe, opposed to facts. Such
a hypothesis must, I imagine, form the basis of the following remark of Professor
W. 'Txomsoxn :—referring to © a thin bar or needle of a diamagnetic substance,” he
s8ays, *such a needle has no tendency to arrange itself across the lines of magnetic
force; but, as will be shown in a future paper, if it be very small compared with the
dimensions and distance of the magnet, the direction it will assume, when allowed to
turn freely round its centre of gravity, will be that of the lines of force*.” I have
not found in any of the subsequent numbers of the Philosophical Magazine the proof
here promised-. But I doubt not the conelusion involves the assumption that the
mutual action of diamagnetic particles is to weaken each other, and hence to pro-
duce a more feeble magnetization along a thin diamagnetic bar than across it—an
assumption which, as already shown, is contradicted by experiment.
