Unfortunately it was impossible to discover the cause of the enormous growth in
length of the Ditylum in subculture 4A. It might have been an infection of the watch-
glass culture with some bacteria which had no effect on the division rate but had an
effect on cell growth.

In later subcultures of line C the length of the cells did not differ much (fig. 28).
The values obtained in August compared with those of April show on the whole a

slight decrease in length.

* In all lines the D cells appeared to be considerably smaller than the double length of H cells. This
is due to the fact that only those D cells could stand the pipetting and transferring on glass slides (for
measurement) which had the original hypotheca well overlapped by the epitheca. D cells with the
daughter cells being far advanced in separation broke apart during that procedure and arrived as two
H cells on the glass slide.

There is also no definite correlation between the length of narrow cells and that
of broad cells derived from auxospores. Among the cells developed from auxospores
of line A there were from the beginning some longer and some shorter than the cells
by which the auxospores had been formed (fig. 28, December). The Axp.-line showed
in April an average length of cells of 147 (D cells) and 93-5, (H cells) respectively,
