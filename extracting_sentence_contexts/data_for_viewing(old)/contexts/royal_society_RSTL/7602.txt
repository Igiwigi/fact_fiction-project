Maxy drawings of the Great Nebula in Orion have already been published by different
astronomers; $till as the present drawing was made with the advantage of instrumental
power far exceeding that at the disposal of previous observers, and as great, care has
been taken to make it accurate, in fact every available hour during the winter months of
seven seasons having been employed upon it, perhaps it may be of some interest to the
Royal Society. :

Several drawings of this wonderful object were published previous to the year 1825,
but they were made with instruments of little power ; however, in 1825, Sir J. HERscnEL
published a drawing made with his celebrated 18-inch reflector (Memoirs of the Astro-
nomical Society, 1826). Sir J. Herscner's second drawing with the same instrument,
but under more favourable circumstances, together with a description and a catalogue of
stars, was published in 1847 * (Cape of Good Hope Obseryations). That was succeeded
in 1848 by Mr. Boxy's drawing, also with a description and catalogue of stars (Memoirs
of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1848).
