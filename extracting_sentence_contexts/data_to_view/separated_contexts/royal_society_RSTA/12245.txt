Thus the position of the rider throughout each experiment
is recorded on a diminished scale. The Standard of Electromotive Force. The standard of E.M.F. to which all the measurements were ultimately referred
was a Clark’s cell, made up according to the directions given by Lord Rayurtau.*
The form adopted was a U-shape, the limb containing the mercury being of a greater
diameter than that of the limb containing the zine pole; in fact, the cell was made
of a disused pipette, one end of which was cut off and the delivery tube bent round. It was supported by passing the limbs through a cork fitted with a wide-mouthed
bottle, and this was filled with water’in which a thermometer was immersed. It
was thought that the temperature of the cell could thus be more easily ascertained
and would be less liable to variation.
