The main question here is whether
there are regular solutions that satisfy a number of plausible physical criteria (finite Planck mass,
energy conditions, etc.). In these braneworld models, ‘everything depends on the extra transverse
Y-coordinate’, grossly violating the cylinder condition met in the original Kaluza—Klein universes. On the other hand, a particularly interesting feature of these models is the fact that a Wick-type of
exchange between the time and the transverse spatial coordinates leads to cosmological models
with many features having brane-theoretic origins. The last brane model we discuss is ambient cosmology. This is an attempt to relate holographic
techniques [115] in a braneworld setting with methods of conformal geometry to motivate the
idea that the brane representing ‘our world’ has moved to the conformal infinity of the bulk, the
‘ambient space’.
