The unit p is clearly a component of the complement

of a, b, c, 4.... k, I. Tt is obvious that if we started with the component
a, b,c,d....k, p we should arrive at the unit 7, and generally any other unit of
a, b, c, d.... k, Tl, y would be arrived at from the res. In fact the whole collection
a, b,e, d....k,1t, p is isolated, and each unit is thus a residual of the remainder,

the only one that there is.

340. The process of the preceding section may be applied to any component
whatever of 8, with this modification in the case of non-prineipal components, viz.,
that where the residual of any pair is included in the component 80 that we cannot
add it to the latter in substitution for the pair, in 8weh case the whole triad must be
removed from the component. This amounts to removing any isolated 7-ad which is
contained in the component.
