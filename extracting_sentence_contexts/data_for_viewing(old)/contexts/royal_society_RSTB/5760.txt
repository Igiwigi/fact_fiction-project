was then removed in the ether vapour by evaporation and the resultant pale yellow
oil was dried over sulphuric acid. ZEIsEL estimations on this material gave the following
results :—0-1356 gm. and 0-1284 gm. respectively gave 0-2197 gm. and 0-2073 gm.
of silver iodide, corresponding to 31-08 per cent. and 30-96 per cent. OCH; (theoretical
for Cy,H g0; (OC,H;)2 = 22-39 per cent. and C,,H,,0, (OC,H;)s = 31-39 per cent.).
The ethylation product is thus either a triethyl ester or a monoethyl ether of a diethyl
ester.

It was shown that the product does not contain an ethoxyl group, by hydrolysing a
quantity of it with boiling alcoholic sodium hydroxide. The regenerated acid melted
at 132° C., gave an equivalent of 121-2, and was unchanged hydrolysed Substance
“A.” Hence, this ethylation product is the triethyl ester of hydrolysed Substance
“A.” This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that this product is insoluble in sodium
hydroxide.

4. Attempted methylation of the triethyl ester of hydrolysed “ A” with methyl iodide
and silver owide.

An attempt was made to methylate the triethyl ester of hydrolysed Substance “ A ”
by the method of Purpre and Irvine (1903). 1 gm. of the triethyl ester was treated
with 2-18 gm. of methyl iodide and 1-79 gm. of silver oxide in 7 gm. of methyl alcohol.
After refluxing for two hours the ester was recovered. It still gave a ZEISEL value of
31-18 per cent. OC,H;, and on hydrolysis by heating with alcoholic sodium hydroxide,
unchanged hydrolysed “A” was obtained. Methylation, therefore, did not appear to
have taken place. It is interesting to note that a similar difficulty was experienced
