It by no means follows, however, that Palseospondylus is a larval form; it would
have been surprising if no change in the relative dimensions of parts had taken place
during growth, from a length of 14 millims. up to a length of 52 millims., that of
Dr. Dranâ€™s largest specimen. On the other hand, the absence of any important structural changes, which might
have been expected to distinguish our smallest from our largest specimens, is a
remarkable fact, and suggests that the characters of the adult were attained at a very
early age. Regarding Paleeospondylus as an adult form, we next pass to a discussion of its
relations to other Vertebrates. Its claims to alliance with the Marsipobranchs have been ably urged by
