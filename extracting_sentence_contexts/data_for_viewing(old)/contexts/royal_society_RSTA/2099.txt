There are also some conceptual consequences. First of all, it is a unification. Our evolution : =
generator extremum principle, the selection rule for the laws of Nature, is not independent 8
any more; it is of thermodynamic origin. Thermodynamic, but not statistical; the axioms are : o
related to the stability structure, the existence of a concave and increasing potential. Is the 1
second law elevated to a first principle level, or are the first principles better understood as : §
emergent? We prefer the first interpretation: the rule is to select the stable materials with :3
1 eo

the entropy as a Lyapunov functional of the equilibrium. Stability is clearly a selection rule;
unstable materials survive only under special conditions. The second interpretation denies the
existence of first principles, e.g. for theories like gravitation [72,73]. If everything is emergent,
then processes without dissipation are exceptional. Then energy does not leak towards the ever
existing microlevel, it is somehow insulated. The fact that the two interpretations are practically
the same is a disturbing consequence. It may be reasonable to postpone the decision until more
is known about the performance of this possible unification, e.g. until electrodynamics is derived
from nonequilibrium thermodynamics.

If everything were to be dissipative, non-dissipative evolution arises as a particular limit.
However, in most of the fundamental theories, it is definitely not an approximation. We believe
that it is an inherent property of physical phenomena; we consider the corresponding equations
identically fulfilled. Let us recall, for example, gravitation. As far as we know, gravitation is not
dissipative. That is true, but that is not a contradiction.

— First, this is always an experimental question. There are more and more precise
experiments that measure the validity of equivalence principles of inertial and
