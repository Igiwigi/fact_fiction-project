coagulability, death due to circulatory failure can be readily produced without the
occurrence of any intravascular clotting. The blood in such cases will remain fluid
or clot only very feebly after death when placed in test-tubes. There is evidently,
then, some important lethal action other than the intravascular clotting of the blood
to be considered.

2. Hemolytic Action.—In all of the four Viperine venoms dealt with there is
evidence of fairly well-marked hemolytic action, for if the fluid blood be allowed to
stand in a test-tube for 24 hours the red corpuscles will settle, and the uppers layers
will consist of heemoglobin-stained serum. Lamp (12) has recently studied this effect
and concludes that the hemolytic action of Daboia venom is more marked in vivo than
in vitro, while in the-ease of Cobra venom the reverse holds good. He regards the
fact that the blood-stained discharges in Daboia poisoning contain few red corpuscles
as evidence of marked hzemolytic action, but this must be largely due to the effusion
of serum brought about by the vaso-motor paralysis, which I have found to be the
most essential and constant action of Viperine poisons, and to their effect in dissolving
the walls of the small vessels, which we have next to discuss.

3. Hemorrhagic Effects.—In the records of the experiments recorded in this
paper we have repeatedly come across marked petechial hemorrhages, especially in
the mesentery and omentum, and in the peri- and endo-cardium, as well as less
frequently in the pleura. Here, again, we find great differences in degree in the case
of the several Viperine poisons examined. Thus the greatest haemorrhagic effects are
undoubtedly produced by the Rattlesnake poison, for in Experiment IV., although the
experiment only lasted 15 minutes, yet there were marked haemorrhages at the end of
