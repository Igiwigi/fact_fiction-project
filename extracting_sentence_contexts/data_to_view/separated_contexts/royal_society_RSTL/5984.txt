But when a force of tension is applied, the case is wholly different. That intestine
mobility which characterizes a truly viscous body, and enables one molecule to moye
round another while clinging to it, or one particle to advance while another slides in
laterally to supply its place, being absent, the only way in which such a body can meet
the requirements of a strain is by breaking, the fissures widening as the strain con-
tinues. ;

Thus, I think, we take account of all the facts adduced in proof of viscosity, and also
furnish a satisfactory explanation of the other set of facts on which the opponents of the
viscous theory havye hitherto based their arguments. Royal Institution, May 1858. *
