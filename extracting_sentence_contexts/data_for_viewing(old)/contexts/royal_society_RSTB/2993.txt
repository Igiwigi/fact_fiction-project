Not because plants and animals are in any way exempt from the operation of
physical and chemical laws, but rather because unexpected factors may enter into
play, or even because living organisms may regularly utilise physical and chemical
properties which have yet to be discovered. In the present case it is necessary to
determine by experiment whether the flow of water through the vessels of the wood

takes place in accordance with Porseurnirâ€™s formula for the flow through rigid
circular tubes with smooth walls, or whether any peculiarities are shown.*

The trachee are relatively rigid, and the fact that their internal walls are not
smooth should be expected to increase the resistance to flow. Arteries on the other
hand are distensible, but elastic, factors which tend to decrease the resistance to flow
through them. The sap contains few or no suspended particles, and can be regarded
as a very dilute saline solution with a viscosity approximately equal in most cases
to that of water. Contrary to the statement generally accepted in animal
physiology, the presence of an abundance of suspended particles in a liquid (diatom
ooze and Plewrococcus in water, blood corpuscles in serum) does considerably increase
the resistance to flow through narrow tubes, and the effect is pronounced even when
the diameter of the capillary is from three to four times that of the suspended
particles. Hence, in the smallest blood capillaries the corpuscles must considerably
increase the resistance to flow, and the same effect will be produced by the passage
of solid particles through an open vessel. Hence, also, when testing cut stems, water
