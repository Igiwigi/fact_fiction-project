as shown in these three concluding columns, it will be interesting to consider the

, the first of the three concluding columns (Table VI.), headed « By Addition,” the

pay separate items or parts, the details of which are given in Table V. The percentages 80
© obtained, are, in fact, the result of duplicate nitrogen determinations made on each of four
- geparate parts or mixed samples, for each animal. The next column, headed—*+ By direct

series of parts only. The last column, on the other hand, is obtained entirely by caleu-
A lation, as a check upon the percentages of nitrogen made by direct experimental deter-
8 mination. The method of calculation is as follows :—From the percentage of the crude
b= dry substance, remaining after the removal of most of the fat by melting and expression,
J the fat afterwards extracted by ether is deducted. From the result 80 obtained, is
= next deducted the amount of the mineral matter. The remainder—the water, the fat,
> and the mineral matter, being thus all excluded—consists, of course, of nitrogenous
S compounds of some kind or other. With the view of founding an estimate as to
