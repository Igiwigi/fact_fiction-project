we saw to have been dissolved in equal parts of blood
and normal salt solution, and that, therefore, no contracture was evidenced. The
nerve ceased to convey stimuli in 19 minutes. Now, comparing this result with that
of other experiments in which solutions of isobutylaldoxime of similar strength were

Stused in the absence of blood, the fact is brought out that the loss of irritability in
Sthe nervous path in the one case corresponds in time with the relaxation of contracture
Bnd return of the base-line to the abscissa in the other case. This comparison
Suggests cause and effect. We have seen that the nervous loss of irritability cannot
che due to the action of the drug on the nerve-trunks ; it must, therefore, be referred
Bo the end-plates.
