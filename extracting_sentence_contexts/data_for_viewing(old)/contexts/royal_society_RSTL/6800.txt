suring at different times the same photograph, and depend somewhat on the judgment
exercised in causing the images of the position-wires to be bisected exactly by the wire
of the microscope.

Photographs of the various phases of the partial eclipse, either previous to or after
totality, exhibit a very curious phenomenon. The concaye edge of the 8un in immediate
contiguity with the moon's limb, appears brighter than the other neighbouring parts of
the crescent, while the convex limb of the wn bordered by the dark background of the
sy, does not appear at all brighter than its proximate parts. This brightening of that
part of the swm's disk which borders on the moon's limb, extends only for the space of a
narrow line beyond the latter, but is remarkably conspicuous. As it cannot be accounted
for by assuming the existence of a lunar atmosphere, it naturally excited a desire to
trace out its cause. The Astronomer Royal, to whom I pointed out the fact, ascribed it
to the effect of contrast, and I have subjected this hypothesis to the test of experiment
in the following manner :â€”Having made some photographic prints of the sun's erescent

on paper, which showed the appearance in a striking manner, I cut out about half of
the crescent with sharp scissors, in such a way that the visible surface of the 8un might
be lifted up like a tongue, and replaced in its normal position within the background at
pleasure; on 8moothing the part so cut out, and causing it to occupy its original place,


the bright line was apparent, but it disappeared when the crescent was lifted up, and a
sheet of white paper was interposed between it and the dark ground of the photograph.
These phenomena occurred when the photograph was examined with the naked eye,
