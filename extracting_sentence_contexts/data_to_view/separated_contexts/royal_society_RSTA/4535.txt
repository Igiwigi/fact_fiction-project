To describe the processes that result in the formation of craters and tsunami waves, meteorite
impacts are often compared to the detonation of explosives. It might not be intuitively clear why

Figure 1. Snapshot series of (left, a) a deep-water and (right, b) a shallow-water impact with L/h = 0.22 and L/h = 0.6. Blue (grey) indicates the water column, orange (light grey) indicates a thin layer (250 m) of water-saturated sediments (right-
hand column only) and red (dark grey) indicates the basement.
