Dr. B6rson* in a dissertation read at Tubingen has denied the fact (briefly
announced by me in 1880) that the absence of steam prevents the combination of
carbonie oxide and oxygen by the spark. He states that he has repeated the experi-
ment, and the mixture exploded, © eyen when dried by phosphoric oxide.” He found
that by sufficiently reducing the pressure he could prevent the propagation of the
explosion, both in the wet and dry gases. He snggests as an explanation of my regults
that the dry gases were tested under a less pressure than the wet gases. From the
detailed account I have given above, it is evident that Dr. Borson's explanation does
not account for the facts observed. I conclude that he failed to obtain the same result
by nob leaving the mixture long enough in contact with dry phosphoric oxide. I may
add that during the last two years, several of my pupils have repeated the experiment
in the Balliol College laboratory, so that the fact of the non-inflammability of the dry
gases when submitted to an electric spark under ordinary pressure and temperature,
may fairly be considered beyond the possibility of doubt.

Experiments have already been described in which the addition of water to a non-
explosive mixture of carbonic oxide and oxygen has rendered it explosive. Into one
: of the explosion tubes above described a piece of potash (previously fused and heated
to redness in a silver boat, and allowed to cool in a desiccator) was introduced. It
was fuged to the glass at the top of the tube above the platinum wires. The phos-
phoric oxide was then introduced, the tube was drawn out to a capillary end
in the blowpipe and charged with the mixture. It was then sealed up in the flame
and allowed to stand. After two days the gases were tested with a succession of
gparks without exploding. The potash was then gently warmed by applying a
