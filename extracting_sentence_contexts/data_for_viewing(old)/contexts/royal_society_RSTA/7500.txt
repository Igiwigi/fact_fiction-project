from explicit formulas. In addition, Hartree & Hartree (1948) have found small errors in
this previous calculation but do not give a corrected energy. In view of these uncertainties
it is difficult to estimate which digits of the Fock-Petraschen result of —161-8 are really
established by their calculation, although it appears that the present result of —161-88
is established to all these digits. The use of this previous result as a guide in the various trials
reported above should be considered as a best expedient in the absence of other data, and
it is the opinion of the authors that the results do suggest that the true energy for the Fock-
Petraschen calculation should be somewhat higher in the absolute sense. On the other hand,
these trials should not be considered just as attempts to improve the particular energies
and wave functions concerned, they have provided very valuable experience in the
organization of such converging calculations, and would make any repetition or extension
much briefer. This is probably of more permanent value than the particular data. In view
of the above considerations and the fact that the present calculations for the first time
include electronic correlation for Na*, Ne, F~, it appears that the wave functions given in
table 2 are the most accurate available for these ions.

The wave functions obtained correspond to a variational calculation with a finite number
of terms, but the process used is such that it can be extended without any fresh type of analysis
to any number of terms when it will converge to the accurate solution of the many electron
Schrédinger equation.
