of the system are not themselves harmonic or even exactly periodic; it is only when
they are analyzed by the mathematical processes suitable to vibrations, or by a
physical instrument such as a spectroscope which yields the same results, that the
lines of the spectrum come into existence. The radiation traverses the free zether asa
homogeneous whole which is a function only of the coordinates of the vibrating
molecule ; it is only under the influence of dispersion or diffraction by material bodies:
that it is broken up into harmonic constituents, which are not independent elements
of it in case they exceed in number the internal coordinates of the molecule.

* In this connection a suggestive result has recently been obtained by Mr. H. C. Pocktinaroy, ‘ Roy. Soe.
Proe.,’ May, 1895, As the energy associated with a simple vortex ring in perfect fluid increases, its velocity
diminishes, so that a theory of gases in which the molecules are simple vortex rings fails to represent the
facts. In the previous paper (§ 87), a theory of simple vortex atoms in a rotational ether, with the appro-
priate molecular electric charges, was noticed. It is now found that the effect of the electrification may be
to reverse the above peculiarity, and, in particular, when the ring has nearly the configuration of minimum
energy for its given vorticity and given charge, the total energy varies very nearly as the square of its
velocity, that is as the temperature. But this configuration is precisely the one into which such a ring ‘
would settle down under the influence of radiation. Similar statements apply in a general way to the —
effective vortex made up of a system of revolving electrons, which is considered in the text, and whieh
is not subject to the instability and the other difficulties that would beset an ordinary electrified vortex
with hollow core.
