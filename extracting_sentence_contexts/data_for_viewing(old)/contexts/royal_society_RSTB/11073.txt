framework

As has been done previously in studies comparing recom-
bination rates across experimental treatments [133,134], we
recommend a more robust and comprehensive statistical
framework be employed when analysing results on recombina-
tion rate plasticity. In the guidelines we discuss above, the
experimental designs become quite complex, and independent
comparisons of day and region do not properly account for
multiple testing. Additionally, these studies typically include
many crosses to get large sample sizes, which use multiple
replicate females. However, most studies do not account for
this source of variation. In fact, most studies report sample
size in reference to the number of progeny rather than the
number of F; parents. Based on the guidelines of experimental
design we suggest above, the experimental analysis needs to
be equally adjusted to account for the sources of variation
appropriately. We do not recommend using simple summary
statistics, or independent tests (e.g. xâ€™). To appropriately
account for non-independence of day and region, we suggest
the use of mixed models. With regards to experimental design,
we suggest being mindful that increased experimental complex-
ity necessitates increased sample size for power to detect
treatment differences (as mentioned in Guideline 2 (section 4b)
above). While we suggest using mixed models to correctly
