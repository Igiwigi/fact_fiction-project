And who can be ignorant of the high level of the

Channel, when they know that the ports in the Channel are

some feet deeper in strong westerly winds, than at ordinary

times? Although the following remarks do not apply to the Scilly,
or Thwart current, yet as relating to currents, that at all times
affect the navigation around the British Islands ; it is hoped
that the utility of inserting them, may atone for their being
out of place. n
It is proper to state, that the facts here set forth, are assumed,
on the ground of detached notices, and not from a connected
chain of observation. Indeed it could hardly have been ex-
pected. And it is also proper to be stated, that the currents
here intended, only form a portion of the ordinary stream of
tide, along the coast.
