Occasional noisy images appear
throughout the history of MODIS. When clouds do not obscure the pixels, viewing angles can perturb the signal. Although the MOD09 product is resampled at 500 m resolution, in fact, the pixels
are elongated in both the along-track and cross-track directions at off-nadir views. At the edge of the scan, the pixel is approximately 10 times as large as at nadir,
elongated by factors of 2 and 5 in the along-track and cross-track directions,
respectively. Therefore, the putative values of the MOD09 reflectance, and thereby
the derived snow cover, incorporate values in neighbouring pixels.
