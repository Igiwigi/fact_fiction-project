478 MR. J. BARCROFT AND OTHERS: OBSERVATIONS UPON THE EFFECT OF

APPENDIX VI. (See p. 434.)

EFFECT OF MUSCULAR CONTRACTION ON OXYGEN IN BLOOD.

The following figures extracted from Report No. 14, p. 19, of the Chemical Warfare
Medical Committee, published in October, 1918, by the Medical Research Council,
illustrate the fact that muscular contraction produces unsaturation of the arterial
blood in rabbits which are suffering from bronchopneumonia caused by inhalation
of sub-lethal doses of phosgene gas, whilst muscular contraction does not produce
unsaturation in normal rabbits.

In each case the rabbits were anzesthetised with luminal, and the muscular contrac-
tion was induced in the lower part of the body by passing electrie shocks into the
skin. Rabbits 19 and 20, ungassed, lungs sound. Rabbits 21 and 22, gassed,
bronchopneumonia, presumably with low diffusion coefficient,

Analyses of arterial blood were made :—

Period 1.—Before muscular contracts.
