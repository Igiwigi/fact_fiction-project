This may of course be explained by the greater familiarity of weather forecasts. Research
examining information preferences for hurricane path forecasts [36] and long-term climate change
projections [35] has found a tendency for people to prefer familiar formats to novel ones. Likewise, the fact that many weather forecasts are deterministic rather than probabilistic may
render them easier to interpret. It is also possible that thinking about the next few days to
weeks is easier than the next few months to years. Nonetheless, the disparity in perceived
understandability between weather forecasts and seasonal and interannual forecasts suggests that
the user-friendliness of forecasts tends to diminish with increasing forecast lead time.
