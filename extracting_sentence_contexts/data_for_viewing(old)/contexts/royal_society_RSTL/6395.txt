XXII. On the Great Magnetic Disturbance which extended from August 28 to September T,
1859, as recorded by Photography at the Kew Observatory. By BALFour STewART, A. I.

Received June 28,—Read November 21, 1861.

Durx6 the latter part of August, and the beginning of September, 1859, auroral dis-
Splays of almost unprecedented magnificence were observed very widely throughout our
aglobe, accompanied (as is invariably the case) with excessive disturbances of the magnetic
needle.

SZ The interest attached to these appearances is, if possible, enhanced by the fact, that
=at the time of their occurrence a very large spot might have been observed on the disc of
Jour luminary—a celestial phenomenon which we have grounds for supposing to be inti-
Smately connected with auroral exhibitions and magnetic storms.
2 The auroral displays above mentioned were very attentively observed throughout
ZLurope, America, and Australia., Tn many places these were of the most gorgeous
"character, while other places were visited by this meteor where its appearance was an
Zvyent of very rare occurrence. Even from as low a latitude as Cuba we have a
Blescription of it by the Director of the Havannah Observatory, accompanied with the
Sremark that only four previous displays had been recorded in the traditions of the
gisland. In not a few instances telegraphic communication was interrupted, owing to
Ahe current produced in the wires; and in some cases this proved 80 powerful that it
Swas used instead of the ordinary current, the batteries being cut off and the wires simply
