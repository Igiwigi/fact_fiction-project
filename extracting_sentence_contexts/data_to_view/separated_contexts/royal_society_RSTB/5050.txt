The rapid production of plates in the modified anterior “ petal” forms a striking
contrast to the relative paucity of coronal plates. There can be no doubt that this is a
secondary complexity associated with the prehensile function of the tube-feet in this
region (MacBripr, ‘Cambridge Natural History,’ vol. 1, “ Echinodermata,” p. 552). In many Spatangoids (e.g., Spatangus) the anterior “ petal’’ is “ morphologically and
functionally degenerate ” (HawxKuns, 1920, p. 417), owing to the fact that the tube-feet
in this region have lost their respiratory function. In a young Hchinocardium cordatum
(fig. 14) the anterior “ petal ” is relatively simple, and recalls that of Spatangus purpureus. Later on the plating becomes complex, but there is no hint of combination into, e.g.,
triads.
