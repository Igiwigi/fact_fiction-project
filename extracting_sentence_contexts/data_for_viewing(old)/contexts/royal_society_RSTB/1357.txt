ion was made from a cat which lived thirteen days. Comparing the crusta on both
the contrast is marked. The degenerate crusta is composed entirely of degenerate
e fibres stained black by the osmic acid; it is flattened and atrophied, and this
“atrophy extends to the subjacent substantia nigra and, in fact, slightly to the whole
* the tegmentum of that side. In the opposite crusta there is not one degenerate
fibre. There is no degeneration of the fillet, nor, indeed, marked atrophy. The
wound is seen to extend towards the grey matter of the aqueduct of Sylvius
and to involve the position of the commencement of the descending root of the Vth
nerve (Z). From about the same region conspicuously degenerate fibres arch round
Re grey matter, to cross the raphé to the opposite side, where some turn down in the

res, extend forwards and outwards and come to a position (B), behind the inner
I@rder of the normal crusta and close to the mesial and dorsal aspect of the lemniscus.
ese anterior decussating fibres will have in their course passed to the mesial and
Sntral aspect of the red nucleus, or even partly through the anterior part of the
Bicleus and of the superior cerebellar peduncle which runs down from it. In fact,
