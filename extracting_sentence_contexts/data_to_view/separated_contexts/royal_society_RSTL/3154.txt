gated in the conductor equally in all directions, thus exhibiting in a remarkable way
one of the primary laws of fluids. 13. Since these facts furnish some evidence in fayour of the conclusion that elec-
trical phenomena result from certain changes in the distribution of a subtle kind
of matter associated with the particles of bodies, it may not be unimportant to ex-
amine the laws of these changes in the cases of induction and attraction above men-
tioned. It must be apparent by experiments 4, 5, 6, figs. 3, 4, that in the ordinary attract-
ive force between a body positively charged with electricity, and a neutral body N in
a free state, three actions arise claiming particular notice, viz.
