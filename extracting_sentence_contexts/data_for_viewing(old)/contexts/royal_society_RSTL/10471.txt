5 leaf which had not yet formed any pinnze, I was able to see clearly the relation of the
massive wings at the base of the leaf to the apical cell; the limits between the rows of
= the segments could be traced as zig-zag lines down to the wings, thus showing that they
are derived partly from the ventral, partly from the lateral segments (Plate 37, fig. 6).
S Tn this species also the apical part of certain of the leaves becomes abortive, the
.5 basal part remaining as a permanent scale, as described by PRANTL for O. regalis.

'Z Tt was in this plant that the three-sided apical cell in the leaf was first found : since
2 the O8mundacee differ from the other Leptosporangiate Ferns in various characters both
Z external and anatomical, it was thought that an examination of the development of
Z the leaf might bring interesting facts to light. The three-sided apical cell has the
Z same orientation as in the two species of Osmunda described above, but its position

= does not appear to be maintained 80 exactly as in these plants, nor are the walls of
Â£& 8egmentation 80 accurately parallel to the sides of the apical cell, Further, the s8nb-
5 divisions of the segments present more frequent irregularities (Plate 37, fig. 7). In
E the absence of distinct marginal sevies of cells in the early stages of the firsb formed
5 pinne, and in the phyllopodium itself, while 8uch marginal series are to be found
S in the later formed pinne, and in later stages of the earlier formed pinnze, Todea
8uperba corresponds to the above 8pecies of Osmunda. A peculiarity of structure of
the wings on the higher ramifications of the leaf in this species cannot be passed over
without remark. Transverse sections of the wings in these parts show that they
consist of two, or at the margin of but one layer of cells ; the corresponding parts of
