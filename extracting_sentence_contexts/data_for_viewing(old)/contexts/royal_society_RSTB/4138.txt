obtained an increased oxidation as the result of stimulation of the nerve, this
increase did not always take place till after the stimulus had ceased ; indeed, in
several cases, VERZAR got a decreased coefficient of oxidation whilst the muscle
was actually in contraction. It should be observed that VerzAr’s stimulus was
usually a faradic current of short duration; in his figure (p. 250) it is given as
lasting 6 seconds ; in some cases he used single induction shocks as a stimulus.

The Coefficient of Oxidation in Active Muscle—The following Tables will show
that we never obtained a decreased coefficient of contraction as the result of activity
of the muscle. The difference between our experiments and VerzAr’s in this
respect was no doubt due to the nature and duration of the stimulus which we
employed. The reduction in the coefficient of oxidation which he observed was no
doubt due to the fact that at times he got almost complete venous stasis (see fig. 6,
also p. 251). Our samples collected after the muscle had settled down into its
condition of activity always came more quickly during activity than during rest.

Having obtained the qualitative result that the coefficient of oxidation rises with
activity, it is difficult to pass from that to any quantitative statement as to how
much the oxygen consumption of the muscle increases for a given degree of activity.
At present we can only point out some of the difficulties which must be overcome
before any such calculation can be made. Perhaps the most fundamental of these
centres about the coefficient of oxidation of resting muscles.

In order to estimate the effect of functional activity upon oxidation, two obvious
courses present themselves—
