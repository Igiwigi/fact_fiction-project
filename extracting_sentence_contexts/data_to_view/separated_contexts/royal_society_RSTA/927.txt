The magnetocrystalline anisotropy orients the magnetic moments along a (001) 22
direction, which lowers the space group symmetry to 14/mm'mâ€™'; the resulting site symmetry of Fe, [4
which is on Wyckoff position 2a, is 4/mm'm'. The presence of inversion symmetry at the atomic : *
site forbids the presence of magnetoelectric multipoles. Our first-principles calculations in this : =
setting confirm this fact. [&

On introduction of a surface, or an interface to a dielectric material, the inversion symmetry
is broken and the system becomes insulating in the normal direction. These two properties
combine to allow the linear magnetoelectric effect, which has been demonstrated for slabs of
other ferromagnetic metals both computationally [9,10] and experimentally [32,33]. Our first model system is a ferromagnetic Fe slab, represented by a superlattice containing
16 (001)-oriented layers of bcc-structure Fe separated by 102 A-thick vacuum layers (figure 1b,
upper panel).
