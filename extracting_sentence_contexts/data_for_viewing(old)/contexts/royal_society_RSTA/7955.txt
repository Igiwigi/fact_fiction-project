tested in this research except copper, which showed greater elongation. It is, however,
only 2°5% in excess of its normal ductility of 36%. Copper, therefore, although
having similar characteristics to nickel as regards improved ductility at low tempera-
tures, would seem to have a somewhat unfavourable influence on this latter metal
when alloyed with it.

In phosphor bronze, specimen 6073A, the additions of tin 10-0%, and zinc 1-61%,
to copper have had a distinctly unfavourable influence on the latter metal, causing

” it to deteriorate appreciably, instead of improving, at low temperature.

Duralumin, specimen 6074/2, retains its ductility of 18% almost unimpaired even
in liquid hydrogen, a fact which is specially reassuring in view of the use of this alloy
in aircraft.

Reduction of Area at Fractwre.—In the earlier research at liquid air temperature it
was noted that in those metals and alloys whose ductility, as measured by their
percentage elongation, was either increased or practically unaltered in liquid air, .
the reduction in area was lower. The present results have been examined in the same
respect.
