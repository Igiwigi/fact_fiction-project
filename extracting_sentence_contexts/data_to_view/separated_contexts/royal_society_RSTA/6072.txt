An
ad-hoc introduction of electromagnetic fields on the brane would explain neither why they are
confined to it nor how they might be considered fluctuations of it, but supersymmetry provides
the means to make this ‘electromagnetism on the brane’ natural because it allows scalar fields
to be connected by a symmetry to electromagnetic fields. This possibility is not realized by brane
solitons of Minkowski space field theories, which all have an effective description involving fields
of spins <3 [8,9]. A closely related fact is that soliton solutions of a maximally supersymmetric
field theory preserve at most half of the supersymmetry, which implies that a 3-brane solution
of a Minkowski space field theory can have at most N = 2 four-dimensional supersymmetry (an
N=1 example was studied in [10]). So we must look to (super)gravity. Of most relevance here are the maximal 10-dimensional supergravity theories (IIA and
IIB); these have planar static black brane solutions that are asymptotically flat in transverse
directions [11,12].
