I believe, of great importance, because of its bearing on the mechanism of nuées
ardentes.

Anderson and Flett were the first to suggest that these avalanches to a considerable
extent generated fresh supplies of gas during their descent. In St Vincent they seem
to have pictured the gases as being liberated during the solidification of discrete
droplets of molten magma (Anderson and Flett 1903, p. 508).

Lacroix, from his experience of the dome formation that accompanied the nuées
ardentes of Mt Pelé in 1902, emphasized the fact that the nuées there consisted of an
emulsion of solidified rock fragments (and detached crystals), in water vapour and gas
at high temperature. As far as Martinique was concerned he denied the generation
of gas caused by solidification of molten material during the descent of the avalanches
(Lacroix 1904, chap. vm).

In the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, in Alaska, where the great eruptive “‘sand-
flow” of 1912 presented many points of similarity to nuées ardentes, Fenner postulated
continuous evolution of gas during the flowage. The solid particles of the sand were
in this case pumice and fragmental glass (Fenner 1923, pp. 60 et seq.).

Shepherd and Merwin, following up Fenner’s idea, reached the conclusion that
fragments in the nuées ardentes of Mt Pelé (in 1902) had intumesced more or less
