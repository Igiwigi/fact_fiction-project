ON THE THICKNESS AND SURFACE TENSION OF LIQUID FILMS, 629

eir surface tensions were identical, the curvature of each would be the same. Van
per MENSBRUGGHE, however, considers that a zone of liquid in the upper bubble
- would in descending increase its gurface, while in the lower bubble the surface of the
* descending mass would diminish. Hence the upper bubble would become cooled,
while the temperature of the lower one would be raised, and this would be indicated
by a difference of curvature, due to the fact that the surface tensions were not the
ame. Observation showed that snch a difference of curvature existed. In one
experiment the sagittz of the spherical segments differed by 1:15 mm., which
diminished after 45” to 0'1 mm. When the system had apparently reached a
rmanent state the plate was reversed, the upper and lower bubbles exchanged
laces, and the fact that the measurements were to within the error of experiment
& same as before was taken as evidence that the phenomenon observed was not due
any inequality produced directly by the weight of the films.
S The investigations of these observers have not left the question of the relation
Setween the surface tension and the thickness of a liquid film in a satisfactory state.
'D We have already pointed out* that the experiment of PLaTeau, who observed a
Ebble formed of liquide glycerique which lasted for three days, and was enclosed in a
:Zex5el containing sticks of caustic potash to dry the air, offers no guarantee that the
