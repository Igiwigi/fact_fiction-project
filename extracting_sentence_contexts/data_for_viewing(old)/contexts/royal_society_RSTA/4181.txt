X10 = X31 = X52 == 5. (4.10)

For open curves no special simplifications are visible.
Going beyond the flat band case is a more involved story. We first ask for what value of T we
have a node occurring after exactly one turn. This means that we have to solve the equation

Qn

cos(A(T))=0, A(T)=3 I, dk g(1 — x(k, T)). (4.11)
This is a straightforward Mathematica calculation, and the result is reported in figure 5a. The
resulting curve is in fact a cross-section of any one out of the three two-dimensional figures given
by Viyuela et al. [3] (their fig. 2, which is considerably more beautiful than ours). They interpret
the resulting values of T—less than half of the band gap at m=0—as an m-dependent critical
temperature at which something dramatic happens to the Kitaev chain. We can, however, easily
complicate matters by asking for the value of T for which we have a node occurring after exactly
two turns, or three turns and so on. Following this logic, we conclude that there is some change in
the Kitaev chain at finite temperature also for values of i which exceed 1 (figure 5b). It is therefore
necessary to reexamine the physical logic behind the Uhlmann phase, and we do so in §6.

5. The interferometric geometric phase

In [12,13], a different geometric phase for mixed quantum states was introduced in the context
of interferometry. Its general definition is fairly involved, but for mixed states having non-
