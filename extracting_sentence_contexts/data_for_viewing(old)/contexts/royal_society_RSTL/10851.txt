careful examination not only continuity between the results obtained before and after
stretching, but an essential similarity.
| At the same time, experiments both with this and with other specimens of iron
have shown that, when loaded and unloaded until the action becomes eyclie, a piece
which has not been strained beyond its elastic limit since annealing behaves after the
type of curve No. 1 below, and one which has received permanent seb behaves after
the type of No. 2.

This difference of behaviour appears, in fact, to form a criterion by which we!
without fail distinguish a strained from an annealed piece.

No. 1. No. 2.

$ 80. To illustrate the 8ubject of F 78 the following experiments may be cited.
The wire of $ 76, now 076 mm. in diameter, was re-annealed in the vertical
position three times over. When it had become cool, the magnetometer reading was
found to be 159 (from the zero of magnetism). Then 1 kilo. was applied, and the
reading jumped up to 220. Removal of the weight brought it to 218. The same
weight was reapplied and removed several times, each time with the resulb that on
gave rise and off gave fall of magnetism, while the snccessive operations gradually
increased the magnetism. Then the range of loading was extended. Thus ;â€”
