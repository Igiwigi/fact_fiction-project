J. F. MILLER ON THE METEOROLOGY OF THE LAKE

The Mountain Gauges —The phenomena exhibited by the mountain gauges in the
year 1850, do not seem to call for any particular comment, as the results are yery
generally in accordance with the deductions embodied in former papers which have
appeared in the Transactions of the Royal Society ; and at the present time I am
more anxious to eliminate new facts and to accumulate a mass of accurate observa-
tions and well-digested results made and obtained both in normal and abnormal
seasons and under various modifying cireumstances, than to theorize npon or draw
from them inferences or conclusions which extended experience may modify, con-
tradict or destroy. The following Table shows the excess or deficiency per cent. of
the principal mountain gauges over or under the quantity of rain received by the
adjacent valley of Wastdale, both in the summer and winter months, in each year
since the instruments were erected in 1846. The positive sign signifies that the quantity is greater, and the negative sign that
it is less than the fall in the valley in the same period.
