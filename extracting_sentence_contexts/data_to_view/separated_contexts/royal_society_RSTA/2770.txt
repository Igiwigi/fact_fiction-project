It is worth noting that the morphology of mantle plumes on a single-plate planet can
differ from that of plumes on a plate tectonic planet [50,51]. As such, one should not expect
surface signatures of plumes on a single-plate planet to correlate in a one-to-one manner with
plume signatures from the geologically modern Earth. This goes beyond the fact that on a single-
plate planet hot spot tracks will not be generatedâ€”the dimensions and temperature anomalies of
plumes themselves can differ on single-plate planets relative to plate tectonic planets. Recycling of mantle lithosphere and crust remains possible in a single-plate mode with several
recycling mechanisms having been put forward [52-55]. Figure 5 shows several non-plate tectonic
modes of recycling.
