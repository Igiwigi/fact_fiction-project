Such would be the diſtance of the Earth's and

Moon's centers, were the Earth immoveable: but it

. is ſomewhat increaſed by their revolution round their
common centre of gravity. Writing x 41 for that diſtance, divided by the
centre of gravity in the ratio. of x to 1; imagine a
ſphere of the ſame dimenſions as our earth, placed
at that centre, to exert the ſame attra&tive force on
the Moon as our Earth a&tually does, the periodic
time remaining unaltered : then muſt the denſity of

this ſphere be diminiſhed in the ratio of x* to x+ 1],
that its nearer diſtance from the Moon may be com-
penſated by the defe&t of denſity and attraQive force. If now an inhabitant of the fictitious earth were ſup-
poſed to compute its diſtance from the Moon, in
the manner juft now ſhewn; the quantities V and
D would be the fame as.in the former calculation';
but his / would be.to our. F, as: x* to. x+ 17, and

thence, his x would be' to'our X as x® to x17,

Sir Iſaac Newton, from the phenomena of the tides,
eſtimated the ratio of x-- 1 to x to be that of
40.788 to 39.788, In that caſe, the cubic root of
— will have for its logarithm 0.003 5934 ; which
added to 1.7787954, the logarithm of X computed
for an immoveable earth, gives 1.7823888, the lo-
garithm of 60.5883 ſemidiameters of the equator. And the Moon's horizontal parallax, for this diſtance,

is 56' 44,07.
