Microbial eukaryotes, also known as protists, display an astonishing variety of

life cycles, cell morphology and structures, metabolism, and ecological strat-

majority of eukaryotic clades and lineages [1,2], and environmental sampling
continues to reveal hidden eukaryotic diversity that remains uncharacterized
[3]. Microbial eukaryotes are invisible to the naked eye, but they are present
almost everywhere—from human guts and the soils we stand on to acidic
hot springs and Arctic ice shelves—and they play major roles in these diverse
environments. For example, about half of carbon dioxide fixed globally is attrib-
uted to photosynthetic microbial eukaryotes [4].
