Carboniferous, As regards the Cretaceous period, we are to-day in an even less
advantageous position than were the writers on the Carboniferous thirty years ago,
and are in reality only laying foundations of a building the form of which does not
yet appear.

Of the majority of the plants described in this paper we have only a single part,
and where two or more parts, such as stem and leaves, or stem and roots, are known
from the same plant, we must think ourselves very fortunate. This makes it
difficult, indeed, to bring the fossils into relation with the plant families as a whole,
and even where their position in the natural system can seem assured, they do not all
at this stage appear to add very much to the sum of purely botanical knowledge.
We trust that the fragments will fit into their places later on, and till then do not
wish to add to the already too numerous theories which have inadequate facts as
their foundation.

As this is a first and, we hope, not a final paper, the conclusions will not be
elaborated at length, but will be confined to the main features of interest in the new
field which this work opens up.

The first and most obvious result of the present work is the addition of the
