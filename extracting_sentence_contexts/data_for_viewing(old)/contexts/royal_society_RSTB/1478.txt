Wiesner gives his reader the impression that the normal exchange of gases through
stomata takes place by effusion (cf. p. 7 of ‘Sep. Ab.’); and further, he has defin
effusion, p. 3, as including “den Ausgleich zweier verschiedener Gase” through a fi
opening, as well as the passage of one gas into a vacuum through such an opening
In reality, however, the interdiffusion of two different gases through an opening is
slow process of pure diffusion without a septum, which we have called “ open diffi
sion,” and quite different from the hundred times faster process of effusion, althoug
in each case different gases move at the same relative velocities. Effusion in nati
only comes into play when the manometric pressure within a leaf is greater or le
than that of the external atmosphere.

We have no evidence that during life such differences of pressure do occur to any
extent within the leaf, which seems, in fact, peculiarly adapted by its structure to
equalize such differences. Such assimilatory or respiratory exchange, as we shall
decide does take place through stomata, takes place, then, by “ open diffusion.”

No further papers bearing directly on this subject appeared till 1887, when
Manan published two summary notes (26), (27), and then followed them up in 1888
by a detailed paper (28) of careful experiments on diffusion through cuticle.

The fundamental object of this paper is the determination, firstly, of
quantity of gas that might diffuse under given conditions across the isolated cuticle 5
and secondly, of the quantity of this gas absorbed or exhaled by the organ to which
the cuticle belongs, in full activity. If the former is less than the latter, stomata mu
come into use, but if the former is the greater, then osmosis may be sufficient t
