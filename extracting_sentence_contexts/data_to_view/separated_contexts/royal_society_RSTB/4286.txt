They noticed the absence of a vacuity, but in their identification of the constituent
bones they mistook the surangulare for the coronoid, which they do not seem to have
observed. In a subsequent paper ConyBrare (Joc. cit.) gives better figures of
transverse sections, but does not correct his original mistake ; he introduces, however,
a new element which he styles the “ crescent-shaped bone.” This is, in fact, the true
coronoid or rather goniale, and is faithfully represented in its relation to the splenial
and other bones in his figures; indeed the lateral view which he gives of this region is

jaw, is of course excellent, all the bones are represented and correctly named, but the
