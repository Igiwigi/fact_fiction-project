Starting from the point A, we find the shearing-force at R' R' (fig. 11) to be 175 tons,
hile that at the corresponding station in fig. 12 is 160 tons. On account of this in-
= wal in the shearing-force, the foremost section of water-borne division (@ a) falls 8ome-
Frhat nearer to the water-borne or balanced section R* R? in fig. 12 than it does in fig. 11,
and the shearing-force at R* is only 5 tons instead of 20 tons. The next section of water-
borne division (64 in fig. 12) also falls closer to R? than it did before; in fact the small
loop of the curye V V between Â« a and 67 in fig. 11 almost disappears in fig. 12. After
crossing the axis at, 6 the curye V V has continually increasing negative values up to the
balanced section R* R*, where the shearing-force is 150 tons instead of 135 tons as in
fig. 11; and this causes the next, section of water-borne division (ec c) to lie nearer the
balanced section R* R* than it did before. Up to this point, therefore, the curves V V
for the two cases have very similar characteristics, although they differ in some respects;
