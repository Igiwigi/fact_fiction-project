Cor. 1. For a polygon of 7 sides, these expressions must
be multiplied by 272 as usual; and when m is greater than g,
A =enſaTp (a,m, T,rT), if in this we make 7 infinitely
great and r infinitely small, it ought to enter into the general
case of the attraction of a circle given in Cor, 1, to the first
part of the lemma: and in fact we get
