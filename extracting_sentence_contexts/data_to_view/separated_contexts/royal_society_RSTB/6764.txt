SUMMARY

I. From observations on the chromosomes of Osmunda regalis by three different
technical methods (sections, aceto-carmine squashes and ammoniated smears), the
following facts among others have been elucidated:

(1) The haploid complement is 22 chromosomes, closely similar in length and with
terminal or subterminal (but not median) attachment constrictions.

(2) The number of coils made visible by the ammonia technique is 4 for the first
meiotic division; 8, of smaller diameter, for the second meiotic division; and ca. 14
(i.e. 12-16) for a cell of the tapetum.

(3) The numbers of coils visible at early prophase of the archesporium and of the
second meiotic division are in accord with the direct evidence from the ammonia
method. In both divisions they indicate that uncoiling cannot have occurred at the
previous telophase but is confined to prophase.

(4) Evidence is quoted to show that no torsional strain is associated with the spiral
shape at any stage other than prophase. The spiral configuration is an equilibrium
position, of the chromosome thread to which it will spontaneously return if forcibly
straightened.
