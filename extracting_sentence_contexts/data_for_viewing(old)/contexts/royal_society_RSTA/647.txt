(c) the necessity of using all of them at different moments for a comprehensive account of Ss
the totality of phenomena that we must consider. .

Parts (b) and (c) of this definition are just as important as part (a), and to miss them, as is
often done, is to miss much of the import of Bohr’s concept. Arguably, the most significant
among complementary situations are those of position and momentum measurements, and
of space-time coordination and the application of momentum or energy conservation laws,
which are correlative to Heisenberg’s uncertainty relations and establish Bohr’s interpretation
of them. In Bohr’s interpretation, one only deals with complementary phenomena manifested in
observable parts of measuring instruments, under the impact of quantum objects, and the classical
properties of these observable parts, to which and only to which, rather than quantum objects,
the uncertainty relations now apply. Non-realism could in fact be inferred from complementarity,
because the latter prevents us from ascertaining the complete composition of the ‘whole from
parts’, to the degree that the latter concept applies, because the complementary parts never add
up to a whole in the way they do in classical physics or relativity.

I would like to close this section by noting a more general long-term impact of Heisenberg’s
approach on twentieth-century and then twenty-first-century physics. This thinking not only
introduced a new type of mathematical model in physics, which is an epochal achievement
already, but, by the same token, also established a new way of doing theoretical physics. In fact,
it also redefined the practice of experimental physics in quantum regimes, at least as this practice
appears from the non-realist perspective adopted here.

The practice of experimental physics no longer consists, as in classical physics, in tracking
