the ‘ether’ of emergent electromagnetism and its long-wavelength Coulomb field is discussed:
disorder can nucleate gauge-charged defects, the interactions between which lead to new
collective disorder physics. We conclude with an outlook in §4.

The material in this article has been selected rather idiosyncratically in order to provide a
flavour of this field to the interested outsider; it is neither comprehensive in its choice of topics nor
a complete historical account. For a more detailed pedagogical introduction, we mention review
articles on geometrically frustrated magnets [2] and their Coulomb phase [3] and spin ice [4].

2. Emergent gauge fields

Antiferromagnets present an impressive variety of possible ground state configurations, crucially
depending on the geometry of the lattice where the spins reside. This is related to the fact
that interactions are frustrated once the lattice contains odd length loops and the ground state
configurations become highly degenerate. This high degeneracy can usually be traced back to an
underconstraint in the system of equations found by minimizing the Hamiltonian [5]. This idea,
amusingly enough, can also be traced back to Maxwell [6].

The intricate structure of correlations within the degenerate set of ground states will give the
excitations special properties.

For some systems the ground state correlations can be interpreted as arising from constraints
defining emerging conservation laws, which are then resolved by a gauge field. This mapping
from the original spin variables to the emergent gauge field leads not only to an understanding
of the correlations within the set of ground state configurations, but also allows prediction of the
