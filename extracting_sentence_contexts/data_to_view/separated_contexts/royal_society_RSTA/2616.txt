With a good supply of
petrol on the edges of the dises there was practically no deflection when the brushes
were in good condition. When the brushes were somewhat worn—usually after
6 runs—it was not possible to take good observations, and rather than waste time in
making indifferent measurements we preferred to wait until new brushes had been
inserted. Careful tests of the brushes were regularly made, and it is no doubt due to

this fact that we are able to record the result of every completed measurement. At
times the thermo-electric and speed variation effects were a little troublesome, but we

never considered them sutticiently serious to justify us in discarding the results. It is
true that in two experiments we were not able to calculate the resistance ; in the first
of these, the apparatus for recording the speed was not put in gear and so no record
was made; in the second, an interference with the battery connected to the motor
produced a change of speed beyond our control and we had to abandon the experiment.
