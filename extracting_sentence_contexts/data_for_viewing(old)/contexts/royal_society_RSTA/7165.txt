energy and nearly all the viscous dissipation (figures 4 and 5). Thus two parameters in addition
to v are sufficient to determine a very large part of the initial period spectrum. Â¢, the dissipa-
tion, is enough to define the similarity spectrum, but the quasi-equilibrium self-preserving
part of the spectrum depends also on another parameter which varies with R,, but not with
x/M. A suitable parameter is R, = J(u?) A/v, which is virtually constant during the initial
period (Batchelor & Townsend 19482).

The fact that the initial period decay law is the same as would be expected if the
whole spectrum were self-preserving leads one to conclude that the quasi-equilibrium
range that is self-preserving plays a dominant role in the initial period behaviour. It
appears that once this quasi-equilibrium state is set up the energy drawn from the small
wave-numbers is kept just sufficient to maintain it, in spite of the fact that as the decay time
increases the distribution of energy in the small wave-numbers changes so that relatively
more and more is found at larger wave-numbers (figure 10). On the other hand the
particular values of the two parameters that determine the quasi-equilibrium must be
determined originally by the distribution of energy in the large eddies. Thus the particular
kind of quasi-equilibrium that is set up is determined by the initial conditions in the small
wave-numbers, but once set up it appears to have an internal stability that makes it very
insensitive to changes in these larger scales of motion.

The initial period of decay cannot continue indefinitely, however, for with increasing
decay time the non-self-preserving large eddies encroach more and more on the quasi-
equilibrium range. One of two effects may bring the period to a close. Either the viscous
dissipation of the large eddies will become significant relative to the dissipation in the quasi-
