adrenaline may be the agent causing pallor is supported by a similar experiment in
which “ after the removal of the adrenal glands no contraction of the melanophore pigment
resulted, although the mouth was stimulated in the same way for twenty minutes.” [Author's
italics.] Clearly, only one of these two observations is true. EHpinephrectomy either
does or does not abolish the response to faradic stimulation of the mouth. RerpFIELD’s
data lend equal support to either of these alternatives.

These considerations, when viewed in relation to the recent investigations of HogBen
and Mirvisu, justify the statement that to-day no positive evidence exists that the
adrenal organs are in any way concerned in the colour responses of reptiles. If, then,
the whole gamut of pigmentary responses is co-ordinated through the nervous system,
the mechanism of this nervous control must be exceedingly intricate. In order to gain
some insight into the nature of this mechanism the following facts must be considered :

(a) Denervated melanophores expand, and can only be caused to contract by heat,
electrical stimulation, pharmacological agents experimentally applied (e.g.,
adrenaline), and possibly certain combinations of electrolytes. This expansion
occurs when the skin is separated from the underlying tissues, or when the
spinal nerves are cut (e.g., dorso-lateral preparation) or when the sympathetic
chain is removed, or when the spinal cord is destroyed by pithing.

(b) Electrical stimulation of the central nervous system causes generalized pallor.
When the spinal cord is transected pallor occurs only on that side of the cut
which is stimulated (HocBen and Mrrvisu). Electrical stimulation of
individual spinal nerves causes a localized response in the corresponding area
