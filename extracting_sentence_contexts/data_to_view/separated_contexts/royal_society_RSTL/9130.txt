A. SCHUSTER ON THE SPECTRA OF METALLOIDE. Continuous spectra.â€”During the first years of spectrum analysis 16 was generally
supposed that a continuous spectrum was characteristic either of a 80lid or of a liquid
body ; but as our experimental knowledge gradually increased, it was found that the
fact of a body being in its solid, liquid, or gaseous state only indirectly influenced the
order of the spectrum. It was believed at firs that a chemical compound always
showed the spectrum of its individual molecules ; in other words, that the vibrations
of the molecules were made up of the vibration of the component atoms. If we accept
this theory, then, of course, we have only one explanation of the different orders of
spectra, viz., the influence of one molecule on another.
