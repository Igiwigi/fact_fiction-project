© That, nevertheless, a dietary containing a due proportion of animal food, is, for some
reason or other, better adapted to meet the collective requirements of the human
- organism, at least under many conditions, than an exclusively Bread, or other vegetable
one, the testimony of common experience may be accepted as sufficient evidence. Tnde-
pendently of any difference in the physical, and perhaps even chemical relations of the
A 3upposed flesh-forming nitrogenous compounds in animal food, which may render them,
Sat least in limited quantity, more easily available to the purposes of the system than the
E asumed analogous vegetable products, it is at any rate clear, that the main and charac-
'& teristic distinction between a Bread—and a mired Bread and Meat diet—consists, not
Sonly in the quantitatively higher relation of the respiratory and fat-forming capacity to
pa given amount of assumed flesh-forming material in the latter, but in the fact, that the
-Znon-flesh-forming constituents in the animal portions of the food, are in the form of
'Efat itse/—and not as in Bread, of mainly 8tarch.
= In fat. we have the most concentrated respiratory—and of course fat-storing material

2Slar as the supply of constituents is concerned, of a given weight and bulk of Fat com-
Spared with Starch and the other snbstances of its class—would it not seem probable, that
Sthe tax upon the system would be less, at least for Fat-storing, if not in a degree for
Erespiration also, in the case of the ready-formed Fat, than in that of the Starch from
ewhich it may be formed !
EZ Again, it has been shown that Fat subserves important purposes in aiding the
Eligestion, and preparation for assimilation, of the matters ingested with it. And
Seertainly the natural distribution and blending of the Fat with the nitrogenons com-
