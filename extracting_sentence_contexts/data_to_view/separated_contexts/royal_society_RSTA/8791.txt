On the contrary, magnesium, which
apparently has no term 1d, has only a relatively weak series, 2d—mf. By analogy, as
the term 1d has not been found in manganese, only a series 2d—m/f is to be expected. As a matter of fact in all spectra the terms 3f and 4f (1f and 2/ never appear) have values
close to 6950 and 4420 respectively. In manganese it is therefore to be expected that
the lines 2d —3f and 2d —4f will be not far from 2d —6950 = 16279 and 2d —4420 = 18809. In the infra-red the lines nearest to »6279 are 6550-0, 6262-0, and 5767-0, but neither
