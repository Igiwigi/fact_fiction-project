It will be quite superfluous to enter into a minute detail of the structure of this
Megalope, further than may be collected by a reference to the figure and its accom-
panying explanation.

It must certainly be considered surprising that 80 many curious facts should have
remained until the present time undiscovered ; but still more, that from the first
announcement of metamorphosis no person has attempted to follow it up; s0 that I
have not only the honour of the discoyery, but also the entire merit of having ren-
dered this interesting part of the natural history of the Crustacea nearly complete,
as the announcements in the previous part of this memoir testify, and my subsequent,
memoirs will prove.

The facts connected with the metamorphosis in the Crustacea and the Cirripedes
are indeed s0 much at variance with our previous knowledge, with the dicta of some
of our leading naturalists, and of s0 very extraordinary a nature, that the scepticism
which till exists with regard to them may admit of some excuse. 'The approaching
summer TI hope will put it in my power to remove all doubts upon the subject, by
submitting such of them as offer themselves to the scrutiny of other observers, a cir-
cumstance which never occurred to me as necessary beyond the circle of my own
family; had there been any zoologists in my neighbourhood the case would have
been different, but in respect of this branch of science I here unfortunately stand
alone.

Whatever indifference may be charged to our own zoologists in regard to these
important discoveries, we must do our scientific neighbours the French the justice of
