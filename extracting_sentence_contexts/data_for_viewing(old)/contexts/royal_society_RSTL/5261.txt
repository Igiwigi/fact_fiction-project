motion of the ſun in longitude, its diſtance from the
firſt point of Aries (meaning hereby the mean equi-
nox) being always equal to the mean longitude of
the ſun: and as apparent noon is the inſtant of the
true ſun's coming to the meridian, ſo mean noon is
the inſtant at which this fictitious planet would come
to the meridian. The interval between its coming to
the meridian on any two ſucceflive days is a mean
ſolar day, which is divided into hours, minutes, &c.
of mean ſolar time; all which it is manifeſt will pre-
ſerve the ſame length at all times of the year,
The equation of time, at the inſtant of apparent
noon, or of the ſun's paſſing the meridian, being
equal to the difference between mean time and -12
hours, is alſo equal to the interval between the mean
and true ſun's paſſing the meridian expreſſed in mean
ſolar time: to find which, we have the diſtance of
the mean ſun from the meridian, at the inſtant of
