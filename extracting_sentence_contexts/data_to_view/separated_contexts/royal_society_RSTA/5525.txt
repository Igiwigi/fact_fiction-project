This is a collective result derived from putting the two models
together. Nevertheless, to a physicist it is highly suggestive that Navier-Stokes singularities are
prohibited.

5. Conclusion

The power of the multifractal method lies in the fact that a spread of values of the parameter /1 are
employed. Whereas the discussion so far has been restricted to the lower bounds on ht and C(h),
now we wish to discuss the physical manifestations of these bounds. In its original formulation,
there exists a fractal dimension D(h) for each value of h [1,3].
