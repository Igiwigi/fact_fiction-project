The fact that he does not mention any
reaction in F;, and only occasionally a persistence in F,, does not therefore show that
these were not present in the degree described in my own experiments, which could
only have been detected by measurements on a large scale. It is not necessary,
however, to suppose that the characters and methods employed by Wotrrereck must
have given similar results to my own. The fact that individuals can acquire the tall crest ontogenetically when placed in
the rich culture makes this a case of parallel induction. KamMeERER'â€™S remarkable series of experiments on the inheritance of impressed
characters is well known. Some of these are clearly referable to parallel induction
His experiment most similar to those described here was carried out on Lacerta
muralis.
