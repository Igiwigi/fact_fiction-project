If there be any number of necks for which the values of & are C,, C,, C4, -+ ++, and no
two of which are near enough to interfere, the same method is applicable, and gives

n=2z\/2utgt =, TITS (4)

when there are two similar necks &,=c,, and

n=v/2 x <3 y

The note is accordingly higher than if there were only one neck in the ratio of 4/2: 1,
a fact observed by SoNDHAUSS and proved theoretically by HeamonTz for the case of
openings which are mere holes in the sides of the reseryoir.
