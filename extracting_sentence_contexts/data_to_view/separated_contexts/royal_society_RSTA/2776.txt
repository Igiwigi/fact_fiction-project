In the stagnant lid regime, the surface exists as a single plate with mantle
convection taking place beneath this plate, and there is no global network of subduction zones
and mid-ocean ridges, or large-scale differential movement between different regions of the
lithosphere (e.g. [15,16]). Stagnant lid planets or satellites can still display volcanism and active
tectonics, as seen on Mars (e.g. [17,18]), Mercury (e.g. [19]) or Io (e.g. [20,21]). In fact, Venus even
shows evidence for limited subduction in some regions, possibly due to burial of the lithosphere
by volcanism, and subsequent ‘peeling’ away and sinking of this buried lithosphere (e.g. [22,23]),
a process called ‘plume-induced’ subduction [24]. However, all of these planets and satellites
clearly lack the global system of mobile plates and plate boundaries that characterizes plate
tectonics on the Earth. Plate tectonics is also thought to play an important role in Earth’s ability to maintain a surface
environment suitable for life (e.g. [25,26]).
