DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MAGNETIC AND THE NATURAL ROTATION. 17

has not passed on into currents, though the acting force and every other circumstance
and condition are the same as those which do produce currents in iron, nickel, cobalt,
and snch other matters as are fitted to receive them. Hence the idea that there ex-
ists in diamagnetics, under such circumstances, a tendency to currents, is consistent
with all the phenomena as yet described, and is further strengthened by the fact,
that, leaving the loadstone or the electric current, which by inductive action is render-
ing a piece of iron, nickel, or cobalt magnetic, perfectly unchanged, a mere change of
temperature will take from these bodies their extra power, and make them pass into
the common class of diamagnetics.

2230. The present is, I believe, the first time that the molecular condition of a body,
required to produce the circular polarization of light, has been artificially given ; and
it is therefore very interesting to consider this known state and condition of the
body, comparing it with the relatively unknown $tate of those which possess the
power naturally : especially as some of the latter rotate to the right-hand and others
to the left; and, as in the cases of quartz and oil of turpentine, the same body chemi-
cally speaking, being in the latter instance a liquid with particles free to move, pre-
sents different specimens, some rotating one way and some the other. 2231.
