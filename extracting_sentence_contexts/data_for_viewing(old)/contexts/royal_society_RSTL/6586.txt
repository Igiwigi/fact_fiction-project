same method of simultaneous observation, the spectrum of each of these electric flames,
as they may be termed, was compared with the corresponding chemical flames, that is,
with the spectra of the oxyhydro- and oxynitro-carbon jets of gas burning in air. The
characteristic lines were present in every case. Lastly, by similar interobservation, a
few other lines in the electric spectrum of the hydrocarbon were proved to be due to
the presence of hydrogen, and several others in the electric spectrum of the nitrocarbon
to be caused by the presence of nitrogen.

The electric discharge through cyanogen rapidly causes decomposition. 'The charac-
teristic spectrum s00n disappears, a black deposit is formed on the sides of the tube,
and the spectrum of nitrogen alone remains. Olefiant gas is similarly affected, but not
to the same extent. The glass tube is much blackened, but the spectrum is constant.
BgrTHeLoT has, in fact, already shown that olefiant gas is decomposed by the electric
current, acetylene being at the same time produced. Indeed, as acetylene may, accord-
ing to BerTHELOT, be formed from its elements under the influence of the electric dis-
charge, it is inconceivable that a hydrocarbon gas could be perfectly decomposed in
such a tube as I have described.

The spectrum under investigation having then been obtained in one case when only
carbon and hydrogen were present, and in another when all elements but carbon and
nitrogen were absent, furnishes, to my mind, sufficient evidence that the spectrum is
that of carbon.

But an interesting confirmation of the conclusion just stated is found in the fact, that
the same spectrum is obtained when no other elements but carbon and oxygen are
