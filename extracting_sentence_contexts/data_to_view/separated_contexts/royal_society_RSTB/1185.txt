Upon this subject
we have accumulated a number of facts and experiments from several points of view,
and as these are in mutual agreement we can answer the question unhesitatingly in
the affirmative. Many of the facts which establish the conclusion that a spinal nerve centre can and
does discharge energy down the posterior as well as the anterior roots when it is
stimulated into activity have more important bearings on other questions raised in the
present paper, and consequently have been referred to in Chapters VIII. and X. We
will, therefore, simply enumerate the facts, and refer the reader to these chapters in
which they are described, detailing only those which have not been already treated.
