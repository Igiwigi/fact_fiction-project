His Account of every Thing is written in ſuch an
intelligible manner, that the inquiſitive Reader is capa-
ble ot underſtanding it, without being puzzled with
perplex'd Calculations and complex Experiments ;

all Doubr, ſeveral Truths mention'd in Sir Jſaac

with thoſe Facts and Experiments upon which Sir
Iſaac Newton bad built thole Queries,

But not to detain my Reader too long in general
Remarks, I proceed to give a ſhort Account of each

Chapter of our ingenious and indefatigable Philoſo-
pher's Book. ;
