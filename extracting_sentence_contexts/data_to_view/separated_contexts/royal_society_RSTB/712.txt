It is, nevertheless, sufficiently important to be
recorded and described as far as possible, and particularly interesting because I have
succeeded in eliciting some new discoveries concerning it, and its probable systematic
position. The yeast of the pink patches was easily isolated and examined, and was found to
be a form very variable in size, shape, and other characters, (Plate 12, figs. 7 and 8.)

Many of the cells were merely ellipsoidal and regular, but others were provided
with short, sharp spine-like processes, while others again were drawn out here and
there into thin hypha-like arms, simple or branched, and presented a striking simi-
lavity to germinating spores. The rosy-pink colour is totally invisible in the thin layers used under the micro-
scope, the delicate cells appearing peculiarly hyaline and watery, partly owing to the
extreme tenuity of the cell-walls, and partly to the large vacuoles and very watery
protoplasm: the cells are, in fact, so delicate that they seem almost transparent
(Plate 12, figs. 7 and 8), and it would not be impossible for a careless observer to over-
look them. The rosy hue is only evident when large numbers of the cells are together,
forming a thick mass. I have not investigated the colouring matter, nor have I made
measurements as to the thickness of layer necessary for its observance.
