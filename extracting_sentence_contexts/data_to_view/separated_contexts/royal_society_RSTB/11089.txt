This explanation lacks empirical
support, however. In turn, a demonstration of the fact that
the processes in each of the two hemispheres are indeed
specific is also missing. Neuroimaging studies, again in the instance of arithmeti-
cal facts, seem to invariably evidence bilateral activation,
most often not entirely symmetrical and, crucially, in some
cases superior on the right hemisphere [9]. By a logic analo-

methods, clinical studies have the advantage to show effects
that may not be expected by the observer/experimenter:
