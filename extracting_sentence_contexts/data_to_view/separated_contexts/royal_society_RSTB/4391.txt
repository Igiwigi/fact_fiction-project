In Cyclotosaurus and Rhytidosteus, however, this opening is absent, and the vagal
foramen is placed very near the posterior surface of the exoccipital. Tt has long been known that the living Amphibia are remarkable in having very
few post-otic cranial segments. A review of the literature, and a detailed description
of the facts in Amblystoma, has recently been given by Goopricu (11), who, in
agreement with Miss Prarr, finds that there are only three occipital segments in
Urodeles. In Reptilia there are probably five post-otic segments, and in fish at least
as many, and probably more. The facts recorded above suggest that the Amphibia had originally the same
number of meta-otic segments as the Reptiles, but that the posterior end of the
occipital region has migrated forwards, so that the hypoglossal nerve, which belongs
to the last two of the original segments, now issues as a spinal nerve between the
neural arches of the anterior vertebrie.
