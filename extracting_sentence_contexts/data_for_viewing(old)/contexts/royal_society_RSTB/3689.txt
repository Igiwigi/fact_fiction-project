and how long one must wait for spontaneous recovery to declare itself before making
the intervention.

Above all this is the complicating problem of how much of the recovery in any
case is due to the substituted nerve, and how much to reunion of the two ends of
the facial and therefore to restoration of the normal paths. In the case of an
operation in the human subject it is impossible accurately to ascertain this; and in
many of the cases this possibility is not at all an unlikely one. The only way to
settle this in most cases would be to expose the parts and to stimulate at the stylo-
mastoid foramen and see if any facial contractions occurred. Such is possible only
in experimental work, and it follows that this source of error can be eliminated only
in experimental work, not in practical surgery. That it is no mere remote possibility
is shown by the fact that in two out of five of Manassr’s experiments, as mentioned
above, this reunion was shown actually to have occurred. Thus, in order to settle
the actual value of anastomosis for restoring the lost movements in facial paralysis,
it is necessary to have recourse to experiment in animals in which exact conditions
may be instituted, and, after recovery, a test made to prove whether or not these
exact conditions have remained good throughout the experiment.

Tt was to attempt to solve some of these problems that the present research was
undertaken. For the purpose monkeys and dogs were employed, and in the following
section a full account is given of each experiment.
