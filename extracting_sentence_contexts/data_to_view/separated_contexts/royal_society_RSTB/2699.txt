Lhe Formation of the Corpus Luteum. The ages of the corpora lutea in this investigation were reckoned from coition,
or where coition did not or was not known to have taken place from the time
when cestrus was observed, the sheep being killed at various intervals of time
afterwards, ‘The facts recorded in the previous section of this paper indicate that
ovulation only takes place during the cestrous periods (or very possibly in some
instances in the procstrous periods which immediately precede them), while the
observed relation, as deseribed below, between the condition of development of the
corpus luteum and the interval that had elapsed between the oestrus noted and the
killing of the sheep in question, is by. itself” strong. evidence ‘that- the two
phenomena occur together. But the method adopted of reckoning the ages of the
developing corpora lutea is inevitably a somewhat arbitrary one, since, as already

FORMATION OF THE CORPUS LUTEUM IN THE SHEEP. 7

remarked, there is no definite time during cestrus at which ovulation occurs, while an
oestrous period may extend over several hours, Consequently two recently discharged
follicles, although of the same age, according to the method of reckoning, may
present slightly different degrees of development.*

I proceed to describe the stages which I have obtained in the formation of the
sheep's corpus luteum, When coition was known to have taken place, the fact is
recorded. The corpus luteum obtained from an animal killed’ seven hows after coition differs
from the unburst follicle in its size and in the fact that the ovum and discus
proligerus have been discharged. It is a little more than half as large as the mature
follicle, and consequently does not protrude from the surface of the ovary.
