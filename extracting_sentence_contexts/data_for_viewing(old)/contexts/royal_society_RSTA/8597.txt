276 DR. G. B. JEFFERY ON PLANE STRESS AND

corresponding to forces and couple applied at « = —, and similar terms in @,, log 7,
corresponding to forces and couple applied at a= +. The corresponding forms of
hx can be expanded in series which are included in our general form, but here again
the expansions are different on opposite sides of « = 0 and diverge for a= 0, 8 = 0
together, 7.e., at infinity. This divergence corresponds to the obvious fact that forces
or couples must be applied at infinity to maintain equilibrium.

Owing to difficulties of this kind we shall find it convenient to insert the
appropriate terms corresponding to the resultant foree and couple over a boundary
and to investigate the stress-function corresponding to the remaining applied forces
which will be in statical equilibrium for each boundary.

Let us write for brevity

¢, (a) = A, cosh (n+1) «+B, cosh (n—1) «+4 C, sinh (n+1)¢+D, sinh (n—1) a } (26)
