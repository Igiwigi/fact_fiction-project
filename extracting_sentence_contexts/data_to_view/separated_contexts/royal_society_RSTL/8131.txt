The present arrangement appears to be a
commencement of the unilaterality found in Scolopendride. In two of the males
opened, merely to observe the sex, one testis with its accessory gland and vesicula
seminalis was much larger than the other, showing a further step towards unilaterality,
The testes are packed in the body one a little way above the other beside and behind
the intestine. The convoluted tube above the testis contains no spermatozoa or vesicles of eyolu-
tion, but only large fine granulated or transparent gland-cells, being, in fact, very like
in structure to the slime-glands of the animal. These tubes are probably diluent
accessory glands of the testis, and might be called © prostates.” ;

The testes examined contained abundance of vesicles of evolution, with spermatozoa
in various stages of development. The structures observed are shown in Plate LXXIV.
