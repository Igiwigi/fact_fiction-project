As we work with the fourth-order biharmonic equation, it is necessary to note that the normal a)
derivative of the total field on the boundary of 2 must be small, and this has been verified [8
numerically. Also note that, unlike in [8,9], a condition imposed sufficiently far away from the [Ss
devices to uphold the decay of the radiating fields is not necessary. a)
