Later, Osawa (63) sought to
homologise the cloacal scent glands with the copulatory organs of other Reptiles, and
concludes (p. 346), “. . . muss ich mit der Behauptung auftreten, dass der Hatteria
auch ein Begattungsorgan zukommt.” The impossibility of homologising the scent
glands with copulatory organs, for both may occur together in Snakes, was
subsequently reaffirmed by Gapow, who concluded (80, p. 43): “ Hatteria ist und
bleibt das niederste lebende Reptil welches wir kennen; es gehért weder zu den

”

Krokodilen, was niemand behaupten wird, noch zu den Saurien, . . . Another of these features is the characteristic forward extension of the pterygoid
bones to meet the vomers, so that the palatines are, as it were, pushed to the side and
excluded from participation in the formation of the middle portion of the bony palate. This, as Howxs and SwinnErRTON point out, is “a feature already recognisable among
the Batrachia and Stegocephalia.” Brpparp (6) afterwards described the skull of
Uromastix spinipes, in which the pterygoids pass forwards almost, if not actually, to
touch the vomers, and so called attention to the fact that this character, supposed to
be peculiar to “ Hatteria,” is also found in a Lacertilian. This condition is very
unusual in the Lacertilia ; indeed, it does not appear to be found in any other species
that has been described, not even in the closely allied Uromastia hardwickii, according
to Buson (20). It cannot therefore be urged as showing any relationship between
Sphenodon and the Lacertilia, for it is distinctly atypical of that order, but is better
regarded as (so far as known) an isolated example of a species of Lizard that has
retained a Batrachian condition that is also found in Sphenodon in a more complete
form:

We are here more concerned with the blood vascular system than with other
anatomical features, and it will simplify matters if we glance briefly at the points
that have come to light in comparing Sphenodon with other forms.
