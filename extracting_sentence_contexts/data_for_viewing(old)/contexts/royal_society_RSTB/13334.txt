5. Conclusion

Explanations for the existence, accumulation and design of
cultural traditions benefit from a perspective that is both
broad and deep, that both considers interactions among a
web of factors and clarifies their contributions by probing
their deeper workings. Not only does such a perspective
reveal that a more diverse set of factors shapes culture, but
it also suggests that explanations currently regarded as
alternatives are, in fact, complimentary.

We reviewed potential factors at the neural, cognitive-
behavioural and populational levels. But other levels are
relevant too, including the genetic, epigenetic and inter-popu-
lational levels. Moreover, cultural evolution can be influenced
and constrained by physiology and existing cultural traditions
[155], as well as the biotic and abiotic environment. For
instance, explaining cumulative culture may require not only
specifying behavioural differences but anatomical ones, as
well. Since Darwin, theorists have hypothesized that unique
features of human anatomy, especially bipedalism, were key
for setting the evolutionary stage for our greater reliance on
