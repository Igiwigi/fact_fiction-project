But first it is necessary to consider certain relevant observations collected in Table V. This table includes all the experiments so far reported in which imperfect leaves or
bracts arose, except one in which the bract was not measured: it also includes one

Notes.—(1) The angles in column 2 are the difference between the normal divergence angle (taken as
136°-5) and the angles P,-wound, to which 3°-5 has first been added to allow for the fact that these angles,
as measured, were about 3°-5 too small (see footnote to section 5).

(2) Columns 5 and 6 are calculated from columns 2, 3 and 4, the are of the presumptive area of I, being
taken as 124°.
