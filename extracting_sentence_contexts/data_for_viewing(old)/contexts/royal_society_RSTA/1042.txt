Appendix A. Equilibria and stability of homogeneous triaxial stretches under
equitriaxial dead loads

In this appendix, we provide a proof of theorem 3.2 (see also theorem 2.2 of [6]).

Proof: (i) The fact that there are no pure homogeneous equilibrium configurations other
than the reference state when t <0 follows from the BE inequalities (2.1). For the reference
configuration, the gradient deformation tensor is the identity tensor, I = diag(1,1,1). To prove
that it is not stable in the sense of definition 3.1, we define the function

H(F) = W(F) — t tr(F), (A1)
and take a skew-symmetric matrix A and the exponential mapping
oo n
cA (eA)
ca u a (A2)

where 0 <¢ <1. Since AT =—A, tr(A) =0, it follows that e is proper orthogonal (i.e. eA
(e“A)™ and dete“ = 1). We consider the following Taylor expansion about the identity tensor in
