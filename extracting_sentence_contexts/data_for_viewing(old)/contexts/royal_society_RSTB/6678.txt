that the factors recognized by analysis as leading a female parasite to a given ecological
station must be such that, as a general rule, these objects must also be characterized by
other features, which enable the progeny of the parasite to develop. Thus, in reality,
“object of a given size’’ becomes synonymous with a normal host, for the most common
objects of this size occurring in the particular environment of Trichogramma are eggs of
various insects, which from their nature contain other characters co-existent with this
size factor. The stupidity of the actions of the female is more apparent than real, for
in recognizing the so-called ecological and psychological selection, the investigator
is confusing isolation in thought with isolation in nature.

It seems, therefore, that the contention that a parasite generally ‘‘chooses”’ as its
hosts those which are suitable for the development of its progeny must be accepted
as an observable fact; the primary tendency of Ooencyrtus and Trichogramma to avoid
ovipositing in parasitized hosts in which only one parasite can develop is a particularly
interesting illustration of the degree to which this obtains in nature. The action of the
female Ooencyrtus in rejecting a parasitized gipsy moth egg can only be understood by

and the behaviour of the female, confronted with a choice of hosts, some of which
contain parasites in various stages of development, is such that one is justified in
inferring that the synthetic relating activity involved in the method of selection is
analogous to a psychological process in man. The graded oviposition response of the
