S. PERRY ON THE

The corpora lutea B, and B, of E146, and the four B,, B,, B; and B, of E130 (figure 7),
were so similar histologically as to render it inconceivable that they were not formed in
each animal under the stimulus of a single endocrine impulse. This fact is illustrated in
figure 25, plate 8, where sections of the six corpora lutea of E130 are shown at the same
magnification. The sections were cut at the same thickness and mounted on a single
slide for staining, and the photomicrographical procedure was as nearly identical as possible
in each case. It will be seen that, of the six corpora lutea, one is evidently newer, and
one older, than the remaining four, and that the histological condition of these four is
identical.
