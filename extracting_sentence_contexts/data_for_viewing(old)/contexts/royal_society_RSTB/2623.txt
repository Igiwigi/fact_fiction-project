quickly or slowly, and gives rise to various appearances in microscopic sections. The
upper edges of the septal invaginations necessarily correspond to the median plane of
the septum, and the presence originally of a larger amount of organic material at this
part causes it often to have a somewhat different appearance from the rest of the
septum.

One of the most frequent appearances is that of a “dark line” in the middle of
the septum, This line is in many cases a fissure filled up by carbonized débris, in
other cases it is the first-formed laminsw in which the large mixture of organic cell-
material has given rise by disintegration to impure, mixed products. The actual
fibrous deposit within the calicoblasts is also in some genera denser in the early
deposited growth-lamine than in those laid down at later periods of growth, and
this fact alone causes a greater opacity at that part of a thin section.

Again, the growth-laminz laid down at the edge are sometimes very smooth, and
those of later growth-periods are less uniform, the cells being active only at certain
areas of the lateral surfaces of deposit. This local activity of the calicoblast cells of
the side-flaps produces granulations on the septal surfaces. Sometimes the early
growth-laminz are not smooth. That is, their calicoblast cells form active groups of
deposit, and granulations are marked out at the first laying-down of the septum,
These differences are of minor importance. The chief point is that organic cells—
calicoblasts—are converted into small groups of fibres, and that as the cell-walls
