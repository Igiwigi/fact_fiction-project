About fifty fish, the majority of which were in Stage II of maturity, were
caught in the river and placed in the stream. After a week these fish could still be
seen in this stream, two nests were found and a number of males with the full breeding
colours seen. he fact that these fish in the streams began breeding earlier than those
which finally nested in the shallows of the river, is probably due chiefly to the higher
temperature of the water in the stream as compared with that of the river. Experi- mental evidence of this will be given later.
