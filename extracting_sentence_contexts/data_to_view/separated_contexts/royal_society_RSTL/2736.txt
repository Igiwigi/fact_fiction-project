the guinea-pig; but there is a striking difference in the case of the carbonic
acid; 80 far from there being an increase of it when the pigeon breathed oxygen,
there was a considerable diminution. 21.27 + 72' = .29 of a cubic inch per
minute, which is little more than a quarter of a cubic inch per minute ; but
he produced more than half a cubic inch in the same time when he breathed
common air; and with regard to the increase of the azote, we may remark
that at the end of the first period of 22 minutes, rather less than ten cubic
inches of azote were left, for

56.69 + 1.50 = 58.19 azote before

but there was an increase of about 13 cubic inches.
