The other
gases, however, not only exhibit a marked action, but als marked differences of action. Their radiative powers follow precisely the same order as their powers of absorption. In fact, the deflections actually produced by their respective absorptions at 5 inches
tension are as follow :—

It would be easy to give these experiments a more elegant form, and to arrive at
greater accuracy, which I intend to do on a future occasion, but my object now is simply
to establish the general order of their radiative powers. An interesting way of exhi-
biting both radiation and absorption is as follows:—When the polished face of a
Leslie's cube is turned towards a thermo-electric pile the effect produced is inconsider-
able, but it is greatly augmented when a coat of varnish is laid upon the polished surface.
