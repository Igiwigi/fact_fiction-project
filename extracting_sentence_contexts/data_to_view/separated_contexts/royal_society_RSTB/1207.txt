yorangium, in this species, arises first as a broad flat growth on the surface of
rophyll. A radial section through one which has just begun to undergo the
sristic cell-divisions shows hardly the slightest convexity of the surface (fig. 56);
‘art where the sporangium is to be formed is occupied by regularly arranged
ficial cells, rather deeper than they are wide ; in these, periclinal divisions begin
near, of which but one is seen in fig. 56; but in fig. 57 two such divisions are
complete, and in a slightly older sporangium, shown in fig. 58, there are three.
is, in fact, the common number of such divisions in the young sporangium as seen
ial section, and a comparison of a large number of sections, both at these early
Sand also older, leads clearly to the conclusion that the sporogenous tissue is
raterable in its origin to one cell as seen in radial section, but usually to three.
feful comparison of figs. 56, 57, 58 clearly shows that the periclinal divisions
azindependently in the three superficial cells. The outer cells thus defined form
Ml of the sporangium ; they divide first anticlinally, as the sporangium gradually
Ss (fig. 58), then also by periclinal walls (fig. 59), while the inner layer thus
ued again divides periclinally (fig. 60) ; the result is as in L. Selago, &c., and the
stresulting layers develop further in virtually the same way.
