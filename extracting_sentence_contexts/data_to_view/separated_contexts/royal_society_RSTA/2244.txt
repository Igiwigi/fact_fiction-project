The Effect of Dispersion. When the photographs are magnified on a large scale they all appear unsym-
metrically broadened towards the violet. This is the effect to be expected from the
fact that the spectrum produced by the prism is not normal, and it is necessary, before
a detailed analysis of the photographs can be made, to calculate the asymmetry due
to this cause and to compare it with the actual effect observed. A complete account
of this problem is given below in connection with the best magnified photograph
obtained for H,. The dispersion on the original plate, before magnification, was
known to be given very accurately by the formula

A =A/+t+C/(n+n))

where A, = 2257°5, C = 116,802°9, d is in A.U., and n+ is in millimetres of the scale.
