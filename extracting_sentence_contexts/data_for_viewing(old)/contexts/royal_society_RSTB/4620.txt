the complex problem of polymorphism. In the case of the winged individuals, worker-
like forms, and larvee I have confined myself mainly to pointing out those features
wherein they differ from the soldiers and from one another. As these differences are
in many cases inconsiderable, an equally detailed account of their morphology would
add very greatly to the size of the present contribution, and involve a large amount
of repetition. An examination has also been made of the intestinal Protozoa ; five
species of these, or allied organisms, have been met with, and two, pertaining to the
genera Trychonympha and Trichomonas, are described as new.

The second portion of the paper is devoted to a discussion of the more impor tant
general biological problems associated with the Isoptera and their relationships with
other insects. Particular mention may be made of the subject of polymorphism
and the various theories which have been advanced to account for the facts observed.
A provisional hypothesis, based upon the Mendelian inheritance of mutations, is
suggested as a possible explanation of the phenomena associated therewith. The
presence of intestinal Protozoa among the wood-feeding Termites is also fully
discussed, and I have endeavoured to show that most of these organisms are more
probably symbiotic, rather than parasitic, in their relations with their hosts.

The morphological work has been carried out both by means of dissection and serial
sections. The dissections were made in salt solution on freshly killed specimens, alcohol -
preserved material only being resorted to in a few cases. For histological purposes,
individuals which had freshly undergone ecdysis were utilised in most instances, and
no great difficulty was experienced in obtaining an adequate supply of serial sections.
Various methods of fixation were used including Gilsonâ€™s sublimate acetic alcohol,
