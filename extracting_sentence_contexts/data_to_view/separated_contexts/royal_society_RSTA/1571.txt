Clearly such a model cannot account for earthquakes at depths of
more than a few tens of kilometres, which require some other process to be involved. But there
is little obvious difference between shallow and deep earthquakes (e.g. [6]). Frictional models
of deep earthquakes therefore require the lithostatic stress to be balanced by fluid pressure, but
provide no method of estimating the magnitude of this pressure, or even determining whether a
fluid is in fact present. A different approach to the problem of generating such earthquakes is to attribute them to
phase changes, which must occur within subducting slabs. But it is then difficult to explain how

some slabs, like that beneath Tonga, can be seismogenic throughout their entire depths, and why : =
the deep earthquakes should occur on faults that were originally generated by flexure at the : =
surface and then transported to depths of 100 km or more (e.g. [7]).
