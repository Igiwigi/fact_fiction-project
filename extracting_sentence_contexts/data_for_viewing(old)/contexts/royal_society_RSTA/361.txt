choices of the parameters, it has good coverage in the sense that it puts some non-zero probability
mass near all possible values of p.

The DP extends the Dirichlet distribution to countable or uncountably infinite spaces 1’. It has
the property that for any finite partition of Y = (4,..., Vx), it marginalizes to a K-dimensional
Dirichlet distribution on the measure (i.e. mass) assigned to each element of the partition [22]. We


write that the probability measure G is drawn from a DP prior as G ~ DP(a,H) analogous to our Lo |
notation for the Dirichlet distribution. An excellent introduction to the DP is provided by Teh [23].
Conjugacy and good coverage suggest that the DP could be a very good general purpose non- a
parametric density estimator. Unfortunately, the distributions drawn from a DP prior are, with a
probability one, discrete so they do not have a density. In fact, a draw from a DP prior can be is
represented in the following way: : 8

where the sum is an infinite sum, the z, are masses that sum to one, 6 is the Dirac-delta function :e
and the x; are locations for those probability masses drawn iid from the base measure H, which
controls the mean of G. To alleviate the problem of discreteness, the DP is often used as a prior on :=
the parameters of a mixture model, with the whole model now called a Dirichlet process mixture iB
(DPM) [20,24~26]. ‘Sp
