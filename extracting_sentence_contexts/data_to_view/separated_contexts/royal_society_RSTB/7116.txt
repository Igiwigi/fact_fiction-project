This also has been
corroborated by experimental studies. In large-scale sample surveys the ‘journey time’ is
by no means negligible in comparison with the ‘enumeration time’. In fact, in the case of
the jute survey the ‘journey time’ is actually three times larger than “enumeration time’,
This is the special feature in large-scale work which makes necessary the approach adopted
in the present paper. Besides the ‘journey’ and the ‘enumeration’ time there is also the time
required for miscellaneous work which consumed practically a constant fraction of the day. In the case of the statistical work also the total number of computer-hours could be split up
into different components.
