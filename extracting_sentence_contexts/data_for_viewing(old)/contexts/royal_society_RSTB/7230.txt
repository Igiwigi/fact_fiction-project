being in satisfactory agreement. At this level, however, only three such discrepant values
would be expected, which gives us an excess of eight unsatisfactory cases that cannot be

explained by chance causes. It is likely that the work done by either of the two sets of
investigators was unsatisfactory in these eight zones.

299. Itis worth noting, however, that there were no cases of suspiciously close agreement
between the estimates for the two half-samples. In fact, the number of cases with a pro-
bability of occurrence of more than 0-95 was only three against an expected number of
fifteen. This proves conclusively that the chief object of using the half-sample method was
entirely successful, and the two estimates based on the two half-samples were obtained
independently.

300. Precision of the sample survey. The estimates based on the two half-samples were
| 1,527,431 and 1,624,706 acres, with a pooled value of 1,576,069 acres. The standard error
S of the pooled value was estimated to be + 17,000 acres on certain assumptions. The differ-
tj ence between the two half-sample estimates was 97,275 +-34,000 acres, which means a
5 deviation of 2-86 times the standard error. Judged from the point of view of sampling
@ fluctuations this is not quite satisfactory, and shows that recording errors had not been
2 completely eliminated, so that statistically controlled conditions were not fully established.
