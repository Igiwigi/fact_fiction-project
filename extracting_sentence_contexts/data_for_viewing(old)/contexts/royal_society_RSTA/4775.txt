since the multipliers q=e'’” are roots of unity (of order N=N(a,b), the denominator of the : 2

rational number abh/27). These quantum algebras at roots of unity and their representation :§8
theory are very well understood (e.g [7]). We call them rational Weyl algebras. A crucial idea of .
Zilber [2] is that, in the same way that rational points approximate points of the real line, we

should have that rational Weyl algebras approximate the full Heisenberg—Weyl algebra. We will

make this idea more precise below.

Let us consider the category Agin of all rational Weyl algebras with canonical embeddings as
morphisms. We have that an algebra A = A(a, b) € Agi is an affine prime algebra over C generated
over its centre Z(A) as a module. In fact, we have that both A and Z(A) are prime Noetherian
principal ideal rings. Every maximal ideal of A is of the form &@ = Aa for a in Spec(Z(A)), and an
isomorphism type of an irreducible module V is fully determined by a such that Ann(V) = @. We
call this A-module V 4(a). Note that the dimension of V4(@) over C is N for every a € Spec(Z(A)).

The next standard step in the theory of quantum algebras at roots of unity allows one to choose
a canonical U"-basis u(a), of size N. However, given a, a canonical U*-basis u(a) is determined only
up to the finite group 14 of symmetries corresponding to the Galois symmetries of roots of unity
of order N, so we associate with « a finite family of bases u(a). The important point is that a choice
of a basis u(a) allows us to introduce the unique inner product in V4(@) with respect to which u(@)
is an orthonormal basis. Change to another canonical basis does not affect the inner product since
the transformations of M4 are given by unitary matrices.
