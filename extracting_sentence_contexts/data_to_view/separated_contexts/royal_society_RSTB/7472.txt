Dr
Merrill states from hearsay that N. tabacum occurs in New Guinea. I should be the
last to doubt it; its non-occurrence there would be next to a miracle. This fact, how-
ever, does not disprove that a native species might not occur there. Dr Merrill’s
informants have assuredly not explored the entire length and breadth of New
Guinea.’

“Tobacco was known in New Guinea at least in the beginning of the seventeenth
century, for it is mentioned by Jacob Le Maire, who sailed along the coasts of the
island in the year 1616....Dr Merrill’s supposition that tobacco was introduced into
New Guinea from Amboina is purely subjective and does not constitute historical
evidence.’ Laufer refers to his own efforts to do away with ‘all wild guesswork and
speculation. ..and replacing it with facts based upon documentary evidence’, but he
admits the possibility of a native species of tobacco in New Guinea, for which there has
never been any documentary evidence. Had he been alive he might have modified
his views in accordance with later information.
