This can be ascertained by following the serial sections upwards and
downwards. Figure 32 (and figure 92, plate 12) illustrate the relation of bud stele to
meristele lower down in the shoot where the former is beginning to fade out. These facts
again support the hypothesis of a basipetal development of bud vascular tissue. In figures 29
and 31 xylem of pericyclic origin can be seen. :
