about 6y.

The required degree of compensation of the earth’s field should be obtainable using the ~
fluxgate detector, since, as already mentioned, the maker’s specification states that the —
fluxgate system should null the field to considerably less than 1 y, and I have no reason
to suppose that the performance was not attained. Since, however, it is difficult to check —
by direct experiment whether this was so, the following experimental procedure was used.
The current in the H-compensating coils required to reduce the output of the fluxgate to
zero was measured with a potentiometer. This was done in turn with all three fluxgate
detectors placed in turn at the same position at the centre of the H coils. The values of
the compensating currents so determined were found to agree to within 0-1 mA, which
corresponds to a field of about 10y. Thus it can be concluded that the fluxgates do in
fact compensate the field as least to about 10y. This is nearly sufficient, according to the
above calculation, to keep the systematic error due to the induced magnetism of the
cylinder down to about the acceptable limit.

Since the earth’s field changes during even a quiet day by up to 507, and much more on
disturbed days, it is desirable to keep the field continuously compensated during an experi-
ment by means of the fluxgate. When, for various reasons, it was not convenient to do this,
reliance was placed on occasional determinations of the nulling values of the compensating
currents.
