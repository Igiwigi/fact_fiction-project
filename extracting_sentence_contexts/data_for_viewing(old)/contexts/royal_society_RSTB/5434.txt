body-wall of the fly larva. Whether the stylet is actually used in the process as a
puncturing organ must remain for the present a matter of conjecture, as must also the
question whether the secretion of the intestinal gland acts as a solvent of the larval
cuticle. Both may, of course, function in the manner suggested, but their mere presence
in the worm need not imply that they are so used.

In this connection it may be pointed out that the infective larvee of Ancylostoma
duodenale and Strongyloides stercoralis, the former an ensheathed and the latter a sheath-
less larva, bore their way through intact mammalian skin by sheer muscular activity,
whilst both lack a buccal stylet or specialised glands directed to subserve this purpose.

The suggestion that the females enter through the skin, and not via the mouth, also
receives support from the fact that in making dissections of fly larvee, the worms were
never found in any part of the alimentary canal of the host. They floated out freely
from the body-cavity of the larvee when these were opened carefully by means of fine
needles in Ringerâ€™s solution or tap-water.

Further, an additional argument against their entering by way of the mouth is that
the mouth-parts of the fly larva are strong, toothed, chitinised structures, working very

contact with them.
