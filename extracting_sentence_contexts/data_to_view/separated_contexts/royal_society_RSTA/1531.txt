ing these results for the error of A and to a temperature of 18-55° C., we get :—
By multivibrator .. A, Fork B at 18-5,° C. = 969-36, cycles per second. This agreement may be considered very satisfactory and can be considered to remove

every trace of uncertainty as to the validity of the harmonic principle of building-up
frequency in view of the fact that four harmonic stages intervene in the calculation
and measurement of fork B in terms of fork A.

5. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES GOVERNING THE DESIGN OF THE WAVE-METER. The experiments and investigations just described gave a great deal of valuable
experience and information for guidance in the design of the complete self-contained
instrument.
