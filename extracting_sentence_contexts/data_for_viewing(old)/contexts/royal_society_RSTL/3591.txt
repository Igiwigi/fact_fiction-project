69. One of the first uses to which this apparatus was applied was an endeayour to
ascertain the existence or nonexistence of fixed lines in the chemical spectrum ana-
logous to those in the luminous, and whether corresponding, or not, in place. To
this end it was necessary to diminish the sun's angular apparent diameter, which was
done by affixing a small achromatic telescope with a low magnifying power, in a re-
versed position (eye-piece towards the sun), to receive and refract the rays before
their incidence on the prism. By this means, spectra were obtained whose lengths
were in a highly increased proportion to their breadths. In one experiment this pro-
portion (as ascertained by measurement of the impression left) was s0 high as 67 : 1.
But in this, as in other experiments where a less degree of dilatation was obtained,

led to belieye it from the fact of some slight inequalities in the violet region having
been repeated, in the same place of the spectrum, on shifting the paper to eliminate

the possible influence of streaks left by the brush in its preparation. The only cer-

tain conclusion then that can be drawn from these trials is, the nonexistence of any
large inactive spaces in the spectrum.
