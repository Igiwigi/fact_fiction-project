The formula shows, however,
that the damping effect of conductivity usually persists to higher periods than the
simple refracting effect of the excited vibrations,

The theory of dispersion would assume a simpler form if the molecules were
systems vibrating about positions of equilibrium, instead of about states of steady
motion. In that case the coefficients ¢)9, e5,.... €, are null: the restoring forces,
proportional to the velocities, to which these belong, are in fact introduced by the
steady motions, and may be named, after Lord Ketvry, motional gyrostatic forces ;
they evidence themselves by causing slow precessional oscillations. The positional
gyrostatic forces, or centrifugal forces proper, are merged in T —- W along with the
forces arising from the potential energy. *
