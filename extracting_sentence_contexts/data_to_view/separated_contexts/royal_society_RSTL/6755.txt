meconin and 2-7 grms. hemipinic acid. 'The barely possible supposition that the addi-
tional quantity of meconin is owing to the reduction of hemipinic acid formed in a
previous stage of the reaction is excluded by the fact that hemipinic acid is not acted on
by sodium-amalgam in presence of water, Moreoyer opianic acid is similarly converted
into meconin by the action of zinc and dilute swlphuric acid. Hence the transforma-
tion consists in a direct reduction or deoxidation of the acid under the influence of
nascent hydrogen. Co Hos + Ez = CoHyuOQ, + Hz0-
