Angiopteris, 1450. The largest numbers are associated with more complete synangial
fusion, the smaller number in Angiopteris with separate sporangia, though the stalk
is short and thick. The potential number estimated for Gleichenia flabellata is
nearly equivalent to that of Angiopteris, though the actual countings run consider-
ably below; still they are in excess of those for any other Leptosporangiate Fern
observed, and as this is seen in a Fern in which the type of sorus is the same as
in Angiopteris, it strengthens the affinity between these two genera, notwithstanding
that the one is, as regards the mode of segmentation of the young sporangium, a
typical Eusporangiate, while the other shows the segmentation of the Lepto-
sporangiates.

From. Gileichenia, as we pass through the table, successively lower numbers are
seen, and the question arises whether there is in these facts any indication of an
evolutionary sequence. It will be necessary to examine the results critically before
such an interpretation is allowed to our enumerations.

With a view to a better knowledge of the circumstances affecting the question,
measurements have been made of the size of spores, stated as the mean of their
diameters, and of the size of the sporangial cavities stated as the mean of their
internal diameters ; these are given, together with the typical output of spores, in the
subjoined table :-—
