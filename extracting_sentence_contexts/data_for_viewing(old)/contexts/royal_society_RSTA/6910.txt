The phases of the two transmission coefficients and of the upwards reflexion coefficient
are very small for all angles of incidence, while the phase of the downward reflexion coeffi-
cient is very close to 7.

Figures 12, 13 and 14 are drawn for a frequency of 80kc/s, both for ¢ = 0 and for ¢ = jm.
The reason for the choice ¢ = 47s that the collision frequency has been taken to be the same
for both frequencies; this was discussed in connexion with table 1, § 12. It would be impos-
sible to use ¢ = 4m for 80 kc/s, since the relation ¢ = tan~! Z would require Z to be large, in
conflict with the requirement | Y|>Z (Y = 16 for 80kc/s) necessary for the splitting into
two regions. For this frequency, and for both values of ¢, the downward reflexion coefficient
is negligibly small. It will be noted that there is a marked difference between the reflexion
coefficients for ¢ = 0 and ¢ = 47; this arises from the fact that the thickness of the region is
comparable with the wave-length at 80 kc/s.

Waves of both polarizations are reflected from region II, and both have their polariza-
tions altered by reflexion, so that both reflexion and conversion coefficients are significant.
The two conversion coefficients are related by the equations

| Pry | ,/cos 6 a | Pryx | /sec 4,
and arg Py = F1-+arg py,

The curves of figures 5 and 6 show how the magnitudes and phases of the coefficients vary
with angle for the waves of frequency 16kc/s, and figures 15 and 16 relate to a frequency
of 80 kc/s. Since Z does not enter into the equations of propagation for this region (see (7-1)
