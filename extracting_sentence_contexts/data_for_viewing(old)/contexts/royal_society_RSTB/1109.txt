which directly bears on the points at issue, we shall draw attention to many of
the more salient details which require attentive discussion. We will, therefore
now content ourselves with furnishing a general review of the function of con-
duction in the cord. We may note in passing that almost all the literature is to be
found in the writings of von Brzotp, EckHARD, GRUNHAGEN, Scuirr, IMMANUEL
Monk, and others. We would, in the first place, urge, what we have reason to do
with greater weight later, that not one of the foregoing methods, 2.e., graphic degene-
ration, embryological, &c., is capable of answering the question of conduction or its
localisation in an absolute manner. The great difficulty in considering conduction by
the cord is the disseverance of the action of the bulbo-spinal centres from that of the
nerve fibres which happen to pass through or by them, and this difficulty does not
appear to us to have met with the amount of attention that it would naturally seem
to deserve. In fact, to our mind the galvanometric method is the only means within
our reach at present by which a solution can be arrived at, and even that method
requires to be considerably further elaborated.

Dividing conduction in the spinal cord into the two great classes of —

1. Conduction of impulses downwards ;
2, Conduction of impulses upwards ;

we are able to summarise the facts which appear to be thoroughly reliable as follows :—

(1.) Conduction of Impulses downwards.—In Man and the highest Apes direct
conduction downwards, i.e, from the cortical centres to the bulbo-spinal system,
