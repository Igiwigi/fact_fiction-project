-Inthe coats of theſe tubes are a
number of ſmall orifices, through which the 920g li-
quor (if I may uſe the expreſſion) exudes; and concret-
ing, forms the layers of that hard part of the annular
circles, which ſore, judging from'the conſiftence rather
- than the texture, have/erroneoully denominated wood. Y Dr. PALLAS, in his E/ench. Zoophytorum, Pp. 162. 1s of
2 opinion, that the layers of which the wood, as he calls
= < it, of the tougher gorgonie is compoſed, may be ſepa-
E rated into numerous longitudinal fibres; that the longi-
Þtudinal Arie, which frequently appear on its external
S © ſurface, are owing to this ftructure; and that theſe fibres
Z are in fact hollow, like the wood of trees, the cavity of
2 the tubes being'cloſed up; as they become hard and rigid. S I was nearly of the ſame opinion when I was writing
2 my FEgay on Corallines, as may be ſeen in the Philoſo-
Z phical Tranſactions.
