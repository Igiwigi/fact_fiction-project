so far as we know, goes on in the usual manner. Bubbles of steam arise, burst, and

project showers of hot bombs and dust into the air. The later stages of the
Peléan eruptions do not essentially differ from those of the eruptions of other
volcanoes.

There is, in fact, a considerable amount of evidence to show that that part of the
magma which gave rise to the great black cloud was not in a state of complete fusion,
but that even the matrix separating the individual crystals was semi-solid and
partially crystallized.* The glassy fragments in the dust of Pelée contain many
microliths. According to the descriptions of Mr. J. 8. Ditier,t “at least half the
mass (of the dust which fell on the ‘ Roddam,’ in St. Pierre on May 8th) is dark
microlithic, more or less felty, but not vesicular ground-mass, often enclosing or
clinging to erystals, and appears identical with the ground-mass of the lavas of
Mount Pelée antedating the last eruption.”

Professor Lacrorx,* describing the ashes which fell in St. Pierre on May 2nd and
3rd, 1902, says:— The examination of the glassy matter which plays an important
part in these ashes is not without interest ; it is compact, with few cavities, or at
