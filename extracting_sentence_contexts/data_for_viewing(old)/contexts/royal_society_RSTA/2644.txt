in science new observations (notably from geophysics and geochronology) and new technical
developments (notably analytical techniques with ever greater spatial resolution) have required
new thinking. In the early twenty-first century, we now are developing an understanding
that provides considerable explanatory power by integration of many diverse observations,
experiments and modelling. The emerging new paradigm is of course raising new research
questions.


Magmatic systems are fundamentally divided into three principal domains: magma, mush and
surrounding host rocks. Magma reservoirs are composed of the magma and mush domains and
have three constituent phases with very different physical properties: melt, fluids and crystals.
There can be transitions between the domains as heat and mass are transferred within the system
leading to change in state. Rheology is a critical property and the fact that the viscosity of the
domains and components magmatic systems varies by 25 orders of magnitude, from the very
low viscosity of gas to the very high viscosity of the hot rocks that surround magma reservoirs,
plays a fundamental role in shaping the dynamics of magmatic systems. This viscosity range
helps explain the huge diversity in igneous phenomena and in the rates of igneous processes. It
represents a substantial challenge to any modelling efforts.

Our review of the emerging ideas and themes on magma reservoirs enables a more nuanced
view of magma chambers and how they form. It now seems clear that magmatic systems are
predominantly mush, but magma chambers can form by a variety of mechanisms. Four main
mechanisms can be recognized, although they are not mutually exclusive. In one mechanism
magma is intruded into host rock at a rate that is sufficient to avoid cooling and solidification
[81]. In a second mechanism, sometimes known as defrosting, host rocks or mush are converted
