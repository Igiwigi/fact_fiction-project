The first three indicate without any doubt that the links about 2460 and 3778 are
real effects, and they show that they cannot be explained by errors of observation, for
if so, the extreme lines would have to be affected with errors beyond any possibility.
For instance, in (2), the differences refer clearly to one about 3778°4 and individual
errors of small amount assigned to the lines will make the differences all equal to this.
But if the link is supposed to be the calculated 3771, the errors in the extreme lines
-would have to be 29°7 distributed between them—a value manifestly too large. The
existence of these variations is also shown clearly by (5) (see p. 367). The origin of
these variations is discussed below in more detail.

The probability curves offer incontestable evidence that the existence of these links
is not due to chance coincidences. But other evidence is available. The fact that the
vast majority of the spark lines are thus connected can be explained in no other way.
A glance at the maps of the linkages given below, and consideration of the way in
which the links are combined, are convincing that although some of the links shown
are certainly due to coincidences the linkage effect is a real one. Amongst such
peculiarities may be mentioned the long sequences of the same link referred to above,
the existence of numerous meshes and congeries of meshes, of parallel sequences,
repetitions, &c. A few of these are exhibited in diagrammatic form in Plate 6.
