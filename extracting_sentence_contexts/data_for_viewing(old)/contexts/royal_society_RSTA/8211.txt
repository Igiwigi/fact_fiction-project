INTRODUCTION.

When Huyeen’s principle is applied to the problem of the straight edge, Fresnet’s
diffraction phenomena in the neighbourhood of the geometrical shadow can be accounted
for, and the theory agrees closely with observation.

But so many approximations are involved in the application of Fresnex’s theory,
that an outstanding event in the history of diffraction theory was the discovery of the
exact solution for waves impinging upon a semi-infinite plane.

This problem constitutes the only one in diffraction theory which has been solved
completely in a comparatively simple form. It is a special case of the wedge problem,
the successful treatment of which is due to the fact that there are no dimensions con-
cerned which bear a relation to the wave-length of the incident disturbance. The
solution of the problem is due to the labours of a number of mathematicians, among
whom Porncaré (‘Acta Math.’ vol. 16, p. 297 (1892-3) ), SommerrEeLD (“ Math.
Theorie der Diffraction,” ‘Math. Ann.,’ vol. 47, pp. 317-374 (1895) ), MacponaLp
(“ Electric Waves,” and ‘ Proc. London Math. Soc.,’ ser. 2, vol. 14, part 6), and Brom-
wicu (ibid.), may be mentioned.

Now, when the edge of the plane is not infinitely thin, or, more precisely, when it is
so fashioned that dimensions are involved which are comparable with the wave-length
of the incident disturbance, there must be some additional effects upon the diffraction
phenomena in the neighbourhood of the geometrical shadow. The discussion of these
effects is one of the subjects of the present paper, for FrEsNEL’s theory cannot be
