Dr Alwyn Williams (personal communication, June
= 1950) states: “... the presence of Nemagraptus gracilis in the Black River indicates that
fany pre-Black River, post-Beekmantown rocks should correlate with the Llandeilo.
3 G. A. Cooper, however, considers that the Llandeilo and Black River are equivalent since
& both mark the horizon at which the punctate brachiopods first make their appearance,
3 but against this is the fact that I have collected punctate brachiopods from the Upper
$ Llanvirn.’ Branson & Mehl (1933, p. 20) consider the base of the Stones River represents
3 the base of the Llandeilo. Q_ It is therefore difficult to give any exact American equivalent of the Llandeilo Lime-
stone, but formations of Black River-Chazyan age may be considered as broadly equivalent. Three conodont faunas of this age have been described.
