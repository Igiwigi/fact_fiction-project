In general, we found it
very easy to implement tests which involved simply building and running the code successfully
on Travis. We implemented tests that compared the results of the computational experiments
against previously computed known answers, which took us 2-4h per article. In fact, most of the
time used for these articles consisted of writing an appropriate tool to parse output from these
computational tests and then compare it to the known results, the problem sometimes called
“test oracles’ [113]. The varied nature of the output of each individual test made it impossible
to write a general-purpose solution, so each test required a customized solution. With these
Cl tests, a researcher looking to use these code bases will be able to execute the tests on their
own machines and know that they have the correct code performing the correct calculations to a
specified level of accuracy.
