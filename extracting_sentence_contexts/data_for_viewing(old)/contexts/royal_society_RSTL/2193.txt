Excessively difficult.

This star appears to have sustained a very extraordinary
change both in distance and position. Sir W. Hrrscur's
measures are as follows :—1781.80 (Oct. 22) Pos. 11® g9' nf,
Dist. 19".538. Thus in 43.46 years no less an arc than
— 36? 24' has been described, being at the rate of — 09.838
per annum, anda change of distance to the amount of + 6”.707,
or + 0d'.154 per annum,

An observation in a 20-feet sweep in 1785 confirms the
fact of the angle made by the two stars being then small.

The $tar is a remarkable one ; and from its magnitude and
Situation in the heavens, not to be confounded with any other.

The proper motions assigned to this star in P1azz1's Cata-
logue, account satisfactorily for the change observed. They
are respectively + 0.08 in R. A. and — 0'.29 in declination.
