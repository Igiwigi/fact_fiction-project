It is, therefore, only
necessary to consider in what degree they lend support to the theories of antithetic
or homologous alternation. The relation of the nuclear differences to normal alter-
nation are in such natura] accord with the view that the sporophyte is an interpolated
stage in the life-history, that Srraspurcer was led on these grounds to adopt a
theory of alternation, essentially the same as that previously arrived at by Bowzr, by
comparison of development and structure. As to the nuclear changes which take place in apospory and apogamy, no facts
have yet been ascertained. The only aspect of the question which can be considered
is how far these departures from the normal are inconsistent with the assumption of
the fundamental importance of the nuclear distinction between the two generations. Apospory presents no special difficulty on either theory.
