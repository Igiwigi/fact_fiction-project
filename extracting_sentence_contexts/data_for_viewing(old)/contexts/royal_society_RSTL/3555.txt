different manner*. The equations of art. 93. are merely transformations of the
original differential equations of the problem, without any integrations ; they are
however in a form which might perhaps be used advantageously in certain cases for
the purposes of physical astronomy. Those of Jacost are obtained by employing all
the four usual integrals of the problem, and are shown to include an additional inte-
gration. They have however the disadvantage of substituting the coordinates of two
fictitious bodies for those of the actual planets, and would probably be inconvenient
for ardinary practical use; though in a theoretical point of view they seem to deserve
more attention than they have hitherto received. It would be wrong to take leave

Q TRANDF, which, as has been remarked by a recent writer in the same journal, effects

5 sz integrations, and therefore represents the furthest advance which has yet been
