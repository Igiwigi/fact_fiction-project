32, Plate 20. These bodies are easily identified as the mammille of the shell matrix, owing
to their shape and their concentrically layered structure. The fact that the
mammille lie partly embedded in the peripheral fibres of the outer shell membrane
is strongly in favour of the contention that close contact, under pressure, between
the uterine epithelium and the shell membrane, is the normal relationship between
these structures. Owing to this pressure and the intense secretory activity of the
epithelial cells at this stage, there is considerable alteration in the appearance of
the ciliated epithelium in the areas of contact, ep, fig. 32, Plate 20, as compared
