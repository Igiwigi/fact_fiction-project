The same
remark applies to the decomposition of water between nitric oxide and chlorine,
which can be effected by neither body separately ; 80 that the changes which take
place in these experiments are not simply due to the fact that the chlorine or iodine
£tand in one relation to water, or to the elements of water, and the nitric oxide or
pbosphorus in another, and that thus the water breaks up, being acted upon by two
opposite forces ; but that there is also, and must be, a certain chemical difference
between the chlorine and nitric oxide and between the iodine and phosphorus, which
is as essential and important a condition to the propagation of the action as their re-
lation to the water itself, and indeed without which they could not have this relation. I am not aware that this remark has before been made, nor do I think it likely that
it Should have been made, but upon the view which I have given, of which it is a
consequence. Facts corresponding to these cases of composition are to be obseryed, as might be
expected, in the decomposition of bodies, for if decomposition be the condition of
combination, 80 of course must combination be the condition of decomposition. Farapay long since showed that dry carbonate of lime withstands the highest tem-
peratures and is not to be decomposed by heat, but that when a little steam is
thrown upon the heated carbonate, decomposition takes place with facility, Why is
this? but that the water is the medium for the transference of the polar action which
can now take place with the division of the masses : thus—

+ = +=
Ca CO, HO=CaO+CO, H.

I might mention many other examples of the same class.
