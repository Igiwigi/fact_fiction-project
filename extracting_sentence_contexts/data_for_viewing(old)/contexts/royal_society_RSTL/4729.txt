do not apply to the two falling tides, as the falling tide by day is invariably greater
(more than double) than that of the falling tide by night.

In my paper on the Atmospheric Tides of the Deccan, I gave a Table (No. 3) of
the anomalies in the period of the ebb and flow of the different tides in 1830, and to
enable me to do this I had observed the barometer every five minutes about the period
of the expected turn of the tide. The anomalies were numerous. In the Madras
hourly observations the same anomalies are observable, as the intervals of maxima
and minima vary from five hours to eight hours, although the absolute time of the
turn of the tide within the hour is not shown. Dr. Bu1st's observations in Bombay
for 1843 and 1844 are also hourly, and exhibit the same occasional irregularities in
the time of the tides turning as at Poona and Madras, The recent observations at
Calcutta do not afford the means of detecting this no doubt existing fact ; for ob-
servations at Calcutta are not recorded by night at all, and only every two hours
during the day. A bare inspection of and reliance upon the Calcutta monthly tables
therefore would justify the assertion that the daily maxima and minima in the oscil-
lations of the barometer occurred at fixed hours, which, although generally true, is not
absolutely 80. The observations at Dodabetta were unfortunately not made hourly,
with the exception of those for twenty-four hours between the twenty-first and twenty-
second days of each month ; the means of comparison therefore of the diurnal hourly
oxcillations with those of Madras and Bombay, are limited to those twenty-four hours
in each month ; but although s0 limited, features of interest are exhibited, It has
hitherto I believe been supposed that the two ascending and two descending diurnal
