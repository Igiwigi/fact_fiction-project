‘Tt will be seen that the coincidences are not very exact for the secondary maxima,
the question is complicated by the fact that several dark lines appear in the same
gion, and the secondary maxima may therefore be masked.

Further photographs will be taken with special reference to this region, special
sures being required, as the photographic plates in use are very slow for this
art of the spectrum, and the instrument has to be specially focussed.

- Other regions of the spectrum have also been examined for bright flutings, more
ticularly with reference to the flutings of carbon. From a photograph of the
pectrum of Mira Ceti taken by Professor PickEriNG, there is strong evidence of the
istence of the carbon group, commencing at wave-length 4215°6, but there are no
lecided indications of it in a Orionis. In the latter spectrum the dark lines are much
e numerous than in Mira, and hence the bright fluting, if present, may be masked.
