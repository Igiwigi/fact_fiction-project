Another problem with visual stimulation during
retinal stabilization conditions is that even perfectly stabili-
zed eye movements may result in associated corollary
discharges from oculomotor areas—thus introducing another
confounding factor in the interpretation of findings. One might wonder whether pharmacological paralysis of
the extraocular muscles could be a better way to stop eye
motion (as opposed to traditional retinal stabilization). Yet,
eye paralysis also has a number of caveats (in addition to its
invasiveness), including the fact that any attempted eye move-
ments during eye paralysis may still produce corollary
discharges. Thus, attempted saccades during eye paralysis
might result in the perceived displacement of the visual field. Eye paralysis moreover precludes simultaneous or interleaved
recordings of behavioural or neural responses to eye motion
and to stimulus motion, as well as—for all practical pur-
poses—recording from the same neurons before and after eye
paralysis.
