is assumed that the points of the circle are all of them equidistant from the centre, and
by this assumption we are enabled to compare distances upon different lines. In fact
we may, by a construction precisely similar to that of EucLip, Book I. Prop. I1., from a
given point A draw a finite line equal to a given finite line BC, and thence also upon
a given line through A, determine the finite line AD equal to the given finite line BC. Since the unit of distance for points on a line is arbitrary, we cannot of course compare
the distances of points with the distances of lines. The distance of a point from a line
does, however, admit of comparison with the distance of two points ; we have only to
asume as a definition that the distance of a point from a line is the distance of the
point from the point of intersection of the line with the quadrantal line through the
S 221.
