DEAR SIR, Munich, Fune, 1787.

Smce my last communication upon the subject of nEAT, which
the Royal Society have done me the honour to publish in their
Transactions, I have made some further progress in the inyesti-
gation of that most interesting subject, of which I propose to
give you an account in this letter.

The confining and directing of heat are objects of such vast
importance in the oeconomy of human life, that I have been in-
duced to confine my researches chiefly to those points, con-
ceiving that very great advantages to mankind could not fail
to be derived from the discovery of any new facts relative to
these operations.

If the laws of the communication of heat from.one body to
another were known, measures might be taken with certainty,
in all cases, for confining it, and directing its operations, and
this would not only be productive of great ceconomy in the
articles of fuel and clothing, but would likewise greatly increase
the comforts and conveniencies of life; objects of which the
philosopher should never lose sight.
