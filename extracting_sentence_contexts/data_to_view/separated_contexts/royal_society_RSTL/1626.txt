From this table it appears, that the regular difference
between the results with six and with two microscopes, is now
nearly insensible. This must have arisen formerly from flexure; and
the new. braces, though intended only to strengthen the attach-
ment of the telescope to the circle, have, in fact, added strength
and firmness to the whole frame of the instrument. (Vide Expe-
riments on this subject in the yolume of Observations for 1820.)

TaBLE VI. shows the difference between the results of the
Dublin and Greenwich circle, hoth at the present time, and in the
year 1812.
