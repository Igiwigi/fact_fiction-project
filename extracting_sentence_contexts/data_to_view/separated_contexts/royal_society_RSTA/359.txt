Since the absolute edge width for Al L,-radiation
is certainly less than a few hundredths of 1 eV, it is clear that the intensity of the ,-
emission band of Al should not exceed about 1 % of that of the L-band. In absorption, the L,-edge should be diffuse, but it should not, of course, be weak. In fact, owing to the greater strength of sâ€”> / than of p > s absorption transitions, its
strength should exceed the statistical ratio of 1 : 2 as compared with that of the L,-
absorption edge. Absorption data in the required region have been given by Skinner
and Johnston (1937) and by Johnston (1939) * for Mg and Al respectively. Neither show
any evidence ofa sharp L,-absorption edge.
