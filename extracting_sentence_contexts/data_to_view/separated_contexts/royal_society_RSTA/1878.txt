Accordingly Geiger and Marsden performed a second set of experiments where they measured
Â«-particle backscattering from a series of different elemental foils ranging from carbon to gold
[40]. The consensus view in Manchester at the time was that the nuclear charge was half the


atomic weight A, and Geiger and Marsden therefore analysed their scattering data by dividing
the scattering power per atom N by A2, expecting to find a constant. The values of N/A? were in
fact far from constant. This was put down to experimental error, although there were hints that
N/A? decreased with increasing atomic weight [40]. The concept that the order number of an element in the periodic table in fact determined the
nuclear charge first emerged from a re-analysis of the Geiger-Marsden scattering data performed
by Antonius van den Broek [41].
