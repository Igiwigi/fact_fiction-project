As ClpV pulls on the VipB
N-terminus, the sheath polymer could be destabilized
and broken into individual subunits. The unfolding of VipB
could be then terminated by dissociation of ClpV from the
monomeric sheath subunit, thus saving ATP. Another important cost comes from the fact that Hep is a
structural component, which is secreted into the environment
in large quantities in many T6SS+ organisms. Hep can
be detected as an abundant secreted protein in organisms
such as V. cholerae, A. baylyi, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa and
E. tarda [2,6,7,67,87]. Because of the extensive structural and
functional homology between T6SS and contractile tails, it is
probably safe to assume that each ring of sheath interacts
with one ring of Hep as it is in the R-type pyocin [46].
