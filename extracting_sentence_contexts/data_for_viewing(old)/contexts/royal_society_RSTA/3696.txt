Finally, we use estimate (3.11) together with the fact that 0, 2 1 andr ~ 1 inside [2ry + 19)/3, (tw +
2ro)/3], and the estimate on the difference vj, — vg, and cover at least half of [2rw + 10)/3, (tw +
2ro)/3] with disjoint intervals like the interval J considered above to get the desired lower bound

4. Proof of proposition 3.1

We begin by showing that F), achieves its minimum. Indeed, replacing the membrane term in (2.6)
by its positive part—that is, replacing the first term under the integral by (vu! + 3(r/R -w Py
makes the problem convex. This modified problem achieves its minimum by the direct method
of the calculus of variations. We claim that its minimizer (v,,7;,) also minimizes the original
functional F;,. This follows from the fact that for (vj, @;,) the expression v;, + (r/R - w),)? must
be non-negative almost everywhere (as otherwise one can easily modify (v,,i@,) to obtain a
competitor with strictly smaller energy). Heuristically this is clear, because the relation ij, +
3(r/R — @,)? > 0 says simply that the sheet is in tension in the radial direction. This argument
also shows that the minimizer (v;,, @,) is unique, because the modified functional is everywhere
convex, and strictly convex whenever 0! + 3(r/R -wyP>0.

At risk of redundancy, we sketch another proof that the minimizer exists, by applying
the direct method of the calculus of variations directly to F;. Indeed, as h is strictly positive
the functional F;, controls the second derivative of #. Therefore, for a minimizing sequence i’
would converge strongly, and this can be used to pass to the limit in the first term.

To obtain information about the form of (v;,7@;), we first set w=0 and minimize F;,(v,0),
