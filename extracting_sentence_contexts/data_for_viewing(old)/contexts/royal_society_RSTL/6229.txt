BerTHELOT'S beautiful investigation of Glycerin, a new field of discovery, the active
cultivation of which has already brought to maturity a great variety of fruits. An im-
portant step in the development of these ideas was made by H. L. Buy, in showing that
dibromide of ethylene can be conyerted into a corresponding sulphocyanate, and in the
conclusions which he drew from this observation, until, in the brilliant experimental
researches of WURTz on the diatomic alcohols, the doctrine of polyatomic compounds
has received its clearest and most elegant expression.

Considering the untiring activity with which chemists have devoted themselves to the
Study of the polybasic acids and, within the last few years, of the polyatomic alcohols,
it cannot but appear remarkable that so little attention should hitherto have been
bestowed on the polyacid bases. It is true that we are already in possession of many
valuable observations relating to these bodies ; but they are isolated, and the facts which
they have established can scarcely be looked upon as more than accidental acquisitions.
Regarded in the scientific sense as a class, and in their relations to other groups of
bodies, the polyatomic bases have hitherto been left without examination.

Respecting the constitution of these compounds, and the conditions under which they
would be produced, no doubt could be entertained. For, as from a single molecule of
water, a monatomic alcohol, a monobasic acid, or a monacid base can be produced,
according to the nature of the monatomic radical by which the hydrogen is replaced, 80
likewise must it be possible, by a proper selection of polyatomic radicals, to link two or
more molecules of water, 80 as to form one molecule of a polyacid base, just as the in-
troduction of other polyatomic radicals gives rise to the formation of polyatomic alcohols
