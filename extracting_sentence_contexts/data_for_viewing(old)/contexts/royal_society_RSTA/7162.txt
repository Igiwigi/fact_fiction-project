The second hypothesis (see Karman & Lin 1949) is based on the apparent similarity in
shape of all correlation curves at different Reynolds numbers and times of decay if the

initial parabolic region is neglected. Physical reasons for this type of similarity are not
obvious, for the rate of transfer of energy from eddies of wave-number less than k to those of
wave-number greater than / becomes negligible as k approaches zero, even considered as
a fraction of the total energy in these wave-numbers, and, in fact, the invariant Ck* range is
a reflexion of this disappearance of the inertial transfer term. In the absence of inertial
transfer of energy between the range and the energy-containing range, it is difficult to see
how the invariant range can impose a scale-velocity relation on the main body of the spec-
trum. However, the hypothesis has been used by Kolmogoroff (19416) and Frenkiel (1948)

to deduce the decay law Poe

This decay law is not valid in the initial period, but Karman & Lin (1949) have suggested
that it may be true in the intermediate period of decay (Batchelor & Townsend 1948 a).
