The manner in which an

pace [A’ —1], where k’ <k, meets, or fails to meet, this 7 is quite complicated,
but it gives a precise analogy to the behaviour of a matrix or matrix pencil. In par-
ticular, latent roots of the characteristic equation of a matrix are connected with the
cross-ratios of four collinear points on A, B, C, D: and the fact that spaces D exist
which fail to meet the scroll 4 corr

sponds to the existence of certain singular matrix
pencils. The elementary divisors were first established by Sylvester (1850-54), and their
properties were first fully demonstrated by Weierstrass (1868). The theory of the sin-
gular pencil, with its minimal indices of two kinds is due to Kronecker (1874).
