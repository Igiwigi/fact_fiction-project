are denotations from some well-quasi-ordering principle F, i. an operator mapping each
well-partial-order P to a well-partial-order consisting of denotations with parameters from P.
Equivalently this term order for a well-quasi-ordering principle F could be defined as the w-th
iteration F°() of F. The result of [59] was that the generalized Kruskal theorem is equivalent to
IT} -CAg.

In this article, Freund and Uftring investigate what base theory is required to prove this
equivalence. Namely, they proved that RCAg + ADS is sufficient to prove the equivalence between
I7}-(A and uniform Kruskal theorem (ADS is the principle asserting that any infinite linear order
either contains an infinite ascending chain or an infinite descending chain). And at the same time,
they establish that over RCAg the uniform Kruskal theorem does not imply TT} -(Ag.

The proof of the fact that uniform Kruskal theorem implies IT} -CAg is quite involved and
indirect: it relies on a result of Freund that JT}-CAy is implied by Bachmann-Howard well-ordering
principle, which in turn had been obtained by a rather advanced proof-theoretic techniques.

Question 3.4. Is there a simple direct proof of m1} -CAp in RCAg + ADS+ uniform Kruskal theorem?

Also it would be interesting to find some other natural well-quasi-ordering principles
equivalent to stronger theories, such as m1} -CAo.

(j) The spectrum of TT,-soundness [60]

This article studies an invariant-like object associated to a theory T which the authors denote
O}(T). Rather than focusing on particular ‘natural’ theories, as is commonplace in the field,
