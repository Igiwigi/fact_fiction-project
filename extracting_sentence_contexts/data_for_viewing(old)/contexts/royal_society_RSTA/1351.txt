So, the question arises: could one have a non-discrete group of isometries G and a molecule
My such that the orbit of M1 under G is a discrete structure (and therefore realistic)? To show that
this possibility is uninteresting, it is sufficient to consider an objective atomic structure.

Proposition 1.1. Suppose S is a discrete structure which is the orbit of a non-discrete isometry group G
applied to a point x, € R°. Then S is a single point, a pair of points, a periodic line of points {ie + c, i¢ Z}
in a direction e, or the union of two periodic lines of points with the same period and contained on the same
line: {ie +c, i€ Z}U{(itA)et+ec, iE Z},ra 40.

A proof is given in the Appendix.

One should not conclude from this proposition that non-discrete groups are not interesting! In
fact, it is a main purpose of this paper to highlight their usefulness (§4).

These results underlie extremely simple methods of constructing objective molecular
structures, which we call the group theory method. Numerous examples are given below. For
atomic structures we simply assign atomic positions and species in, say, Molecule 1, and we take
its orbit under a discrete group of isometries to generate a molecular structure. In addition to
the empirical observation of the widespread appearance of such structures, there are obvious
theorems of stability. Since each atom of an objective atomic structure sees the same environment,
then, for typical (i.e. frame-indifferent) descriptions of atomic forces, if one atom of the structure is
in equilibrium, then all atoms are in equilibrium. Similar arguments apply to stability [1]. A recent


thesis [5] exploits this underlying structure for linear stability analysis in which many atoms are
