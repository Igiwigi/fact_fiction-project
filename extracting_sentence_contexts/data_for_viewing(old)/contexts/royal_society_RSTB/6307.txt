which do not appear to be parous.

VIâ€”FERrTILITY

It can be seen from fig. 2 that during May, June, July, and August over 80% of
all adults are pregnant. Since it may be assumed that the period of gestation is
short, as in the white mouse, and since many of the adults during these months are
known to be parous it is clear that many animals must be pregnant while suckling

previous litters. It is probable, in fact, that the majority of animals become pregnant
again at the post-partum oestrus. Thus, those which start to breed at the beginning
of the season and continue until the end of July or beginning of August may rear as
many as four or even five litters in succession. The frequent occurrence of pregnant
animals that were also lactating confirms these deductions. In some of the early
stages of pregnancy the condition of the uterus as well as that of the mammary glands
showed that the pregnancy dated from an oestrous period occurring immediately
after parturition.

The mean number of young in a litter can be estimated from the mean number of
ova ovulated at each oestrus as shown by the number of corpora lutea in each set,
from the mean number of embryos 7n utero in the later stages of pregnancy and from
the mean number of placental sites visible in parous uteri.
