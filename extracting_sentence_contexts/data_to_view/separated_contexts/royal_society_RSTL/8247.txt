ROBERT MALLET ON VOLCANIC ENERGY,

1st. The crushing of the earth's solid crust affords a supply of energy 8ficient to
account for terrestrial yulcanicity * ;
2nd. That the necessary amount of crushing falls within the limits that may be
admitted as due to terrestrial contraction by secular refrigeration;
and if s0, that the cause thus assigned is probably the true cause of existing volcanic
action, will further appear on comparing the conditions, or some of them, that we can
predicate must follow from such crushing action going on locally within the earth's
solid crust, with some of the best known facts of observation of volcanoes themselvyes, to
which we now proceed.

202. A primary characteristic of the yiew of volcanic action here proposed is, that it
is only one phase of a unique force which has always been in action, though always
decreasing in energy, since our planet was nebulous. It introduces no hazy hypotheses of © reaction of the interior against the exterior,” of
internal distension by unknown gases, of chemical actions in the interior unsupported by
proof of their existence.
