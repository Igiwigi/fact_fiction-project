A striking characteristic of the
internal phloem is the occurrence of groups of tannin sacs between each protoxylem
group (Plate 49, fig. 25, Â¢.). A few secretory cells occur also in the external phloem. The groups of secretory sacs, which form a conspicuous feature in the petiole stele
(Plate 47, fig. 3, t.), are formed at an early stage in the development of the leaf; in
fact, they appear to be among the earliest differentiated elements. The secretory
elements are clearly shown in the section of a fairly young petiole, reproduced in
Plate 47, fig. 5, t. The diagrammatic sections shown in Text-figure | illustrate the behaviour of the
petiole stele as it alters its form a short distance below the summit of the petiole, and
