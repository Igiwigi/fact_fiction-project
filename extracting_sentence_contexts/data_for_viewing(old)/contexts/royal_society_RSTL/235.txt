of this ingenious chemist seem to have been founded upon the
want of effervescence in the process; and his experiments
were made at a very early period of the investigation, and
probably before this time he has found reason to alter his
opinion.

It is probable that a binary compound of jodine and oxygene
may be formed, but the facts presented by the action of acids
on the triple compounds are not sufficient to prove its exist-
ence.

When small quantities of very diluted sulphuric acid are
digested on the triple compounds of potassium and barium,
the fluid obtained is always acid, and always precipitates mu-
riate of baryta. I thought'it possible that the compound of
iodine and oxygene might possess this property ; but on col-
lecting the precipitate and examining it, it appeared to be a
mixture of the triple compound and sulphate of baryta, and
from all the facts it appears that in the action of acids on the
triple compounds new combinations only are formed.* ;
