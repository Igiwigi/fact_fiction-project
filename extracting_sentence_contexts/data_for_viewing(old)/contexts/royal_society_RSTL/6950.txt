The present communication having reference to one branch only of one department
of this extensive inquiry, viz. to that which relates to the magnetic disturbances, its
notices are strictly limited to what may be necessary for placing before the Society as
briefly as possible the snccessive steps which have advanced our knowledge of these
phenomena, in respect to their diversities and mutual relations, their connexion with
the general phenomena of terrestrial magnetism, and their probable cosmical origin.

The simultaneity of the days on which magnetic disturbances take place had already
been shown by the term-days of the Gottingen Association to be coextensive with its
sphere of operation, viz. the greater part of the continent of Europe. 'The wider exten-
sjon of the British system, embracing stations in all quarters of the globe, now caused
the fact of the simultaneity of disturbance to be recognized as a general feature common
to the whole of our planet; whilst the evidence of diversity in the action of individual
forces, even in the most clear cases of synchronous disturbance, was even more distinctly
manifested than in the previous more limited experience. Thus the comparison of the
term-days in 1840, 1841, and 1842 observed at different stations on the continents of
Furope and America, and collated in the first yolume of the Observations at the Toronto
Obseryatory, published in 1845, gave occasion to the following general conclusion â€”
*'The correspondence 80 strikingly manifested in the fluctuations in America, and which

has its counterpart in the correspondence shown by the term-observations at the different
stations in Europe, is not found to prevail in anything like the same degree between the
