is based) the corresponding value of ¢ at any point in the fluid field ; for if the doublet
intensity has a value o («’) at a point («’, 0) on that part of the line (8 = 0) which lies
between (% = -+ «,), and is zero outside this range, it is evident that at any point («, 6)
in the field ¢ will be given by

where Z (x, 6) stands for that function of «, 8 which has hitherto been denoted by %3.

The integration is easily performed by graphical or approximate numerical methods.
Figs. 2-6 exhibit distributions of which have been determined in this way. They

* Tt will be remembered that v has the dimensions L?/T.
