equivalent refractive power within the limits of experimental error, as simple functions
of the radions, and to express the viscosities, with a fair approach to accuracy, not
merely as a function of the radions of the solute, but also upon the extended
conception of the radion as being simply proportional to the radion, or average
molecular radius, of the whole solution. Our hypothesis has also enabled us to
discover new relations which are independent of the hypothesis, viz., the fact that
the Hittorf migration numbers are a linear function of (B+/7")™, and the fact that
the effective molecular freezing-point depression and the equivalent refractive power
are linear functions of the solution volume.

It is submitted that the above considerations justify the working hypothesis, that
the function which we have named the radion, derived as above described, may in
fact be taken to be a measure of the actual sizes of the ions. In any case, the radion
turns out to be of fundamental importance in correlating the various phenomena of
solution.

Reasons for Supposing that the Van’t Hoff Law with Index exactly 2 is an Accurate
Law for certain Binary Electrolytes with Monovalent Ions.

1. A large number of such electrolytes follow the Van ’t Hoff law with close
approximation over a considerable range of dilution. (See Bancrort, ‘ Zeit. Phys.
