The changes in the shape of the individual during growth bear little, if any, relationship
to the changes in the shape of the species during evolution.

During growth an individual of M. coranguinum became relatively broader and flatter,
with a deeper anterior notch and a more marked fasciole. There seems to have been little
change in either the extent of the posterior rise of the test, or in the degree of projection
of the labrum. During evolution, however, the animals became relatively broader and
taller, with a deeper notch and a more pronounced labrum and posterior rise to the test.
In addition, the sub-anal fasciole became larger in area. Kongiel (1949) noticed that in
species of Echinocorys there was similarly no particular relationship between the relative
growth rates in the individual and the evolutionary trends in the species. ‘These echinoids,
in fact, do not show recapitulation. Even attempts to explain evolutionary processes in
terms of the speeding up or the slowing down of the process of allometric growth in the
post-larval state are not supported by a study of Micraster.

(c) The relationships between the characters in Micraster coranguinum

We have already seen (§ VI above) that it is possible to discount the effect of the overall
size of the animal in considering the interrelationships of certain of the characters. For
example, there are significant positive correlations between the three characters ‘depth
of anterior groove’, ‘degree of development of the labrum’ and ‘extent of the posterior
rise of the test’, even in specimens of the same length, breadth and height. In this case
the area of the sub-anal fasciole is uncorrelated with any of the above three variates.
