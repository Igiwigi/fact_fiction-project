(b) Description of calculation of eclipse impact

The calculation of the impact of the eclipse, while a routine astronomical calculation, is relatively
complex if performed with a high degree of accuracy. Rather than try to reproduce this
calculation, the data provided by NASA [17] were used. These provide the location, path width
and Moon: Sun diameter ratio for the total eclipse (among other things), at 2 min intervals. From
this, it is relatively straightforward (assuming a spherical Earth, as in the MetUM) to estimate an
apparent angular separation of the Moon and Sun observed from any location on Earth. From
this, a reduction in incoming solar radiation was estimated on the basis of overlapping circles.
Some extrapolation of the apparent Moon position was also required during the times before and
after totality, though the impact of these is not large.

The procedure as a whole is not perfect, and is further complicated by the fact that the
model uses a spherical Earth approximation, but differences between the calculated reduction in
incoming radiation and the eclipse magnitude published by NASA [17] are of the order of 1%. The
calculated ‘eclipse shadow factor’ (i.e. the proportional reduction in top of atmosphere incoming
radiation) at 0930 UTC (approximately the time of maximum eclipse over central England) is
shown in figure 1a, whereas the time series of the factor at Reading, UK, is plotted (at 5 min
intervals) in figure 1b. This has a peak of about 84%, compared with the accurate figure of 85%.
Reading is shown purely as an example—the curve varies very little over most of England.

The radiation scheme in the MetUM is that of Edwards & Slingo [18]. It is a comprehensive
code that calculates short-wave (SW) and long-wave (LW) interaction with the atmosphere and
surface. It is a computationally expensive code, and the full code is only called every 15 min, with
an approximate update due to changes in cloud every 5 min. The direct SW radiation is updated
