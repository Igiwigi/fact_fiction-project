unaware of the fact that, in H. miliaris, the first “ cone’ differs from all succeeding
ones in having a simple origin. As all subsequent ones are formed from a pair of lamellie,
he writes, ‘‘ one may therefore reasonably infer that each of these five (primordial) cones
also arises in the same way from a pair of lamelle,” and these he termed the “ pair of
primordial lamelle.’’ The larger lamella of the second “ cone ” almost equals the first
“cone” in length in advanced Kchinoplutei (see fig. 14, e, also Plate 11, fig. 1 given by
DeEvANESEN). This, together with the fact that the two lamelle of “ cone” 2 are still

’

far from fusing might have suggested that the first “‘ cone ”’ is either simple from the
beginning, or, if double, the lamellae must fuse very early. Besides this, he cites THiet’s
paper (1892), and he must have been aware of the fact that Tuer describes the first

“cone ” in the tooth of Hchinocyamus as arising from a single “ tetrahedron.”

Parr JIl.—Tue Posr Larva DEVELOPMENT OF THE TEST,

The test of Hchinus may conveniently be divided into three parts: (a) the apical
system of plates, consisting of the periproct plates and the genitals with which the oculars
may be grouped, although really belonging to the corona; (b) the corona, and (¢) the
plates in the buccal membrane or peristome.

In an adult Z. miliaris the apical system occupies only a relatively small area in the
centre of the dorsal surface. The periproct is covered with numerous small plates,
