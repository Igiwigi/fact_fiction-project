proposal made in [1] to formulate the theory of prices based on the concept of the action 2 |
functional, and the subsequent publication [2] that provides strong empirical evidence in support

of this formulation. The primary focus in the statistical microeconomics formulation is to “3
describe the unequal time correlation functions of market prices. The auto-correlation function 8

for single commodities is modelled using the action functional and Feynman path integral.
The auto-correlation also provides a stringent test of the accuracy of the model.

The view taken in statistical microeconomics [1] is that supply and demand are inseparable
and in fact are two facets of a single entity, namely the microeconomics potential function V[p]. The
potential can be chosen to be the sum of supply and demand [1]

Vip] = Pip] + Sip], (1.1)

but can be more general, as discussed later. : =

The potential function V[p], similar to mechanics, drives the evolution of market prices. For the [=
special case when the prices are constant (time independent)—given by the constant prices : yy
Po = (P01, Po2,---,Pon)—the prices minimize the value of the potential; namely that V[pp] is a : 2
minimum of V[p]. aes

The break-up of the microeconomic potential into a sum of supply and demand need not hold if
