the controlled enhancement or slowing down of the convection in the case where all species
have the same diffusion coefficients [76,85]. In short, the reaction is stabilizing when the product
is less dense than the reactants, as shown experimentally in the case of an ester dissolving in
an aqueous solution of NaOH [78]. The local decrease of density induced by the fact that the
product is less dense creates a non-monotonic density profile [71,76,78,85,86] with a minimum
that blocks the further progression of the fingers in the bulk of the host phase. On the contrary,
a destabilizing effect can be obtained when the product has a sufficiently larger contribution to
density than both reactants. We have experimentally demonstrated this case for dissolution of
gaseous CO} into aqueous solutions of hydroxide bases (figure 6) [53,76]. A striking aspect of
this control is the fact that the amplitude of the chemical stabilization or enhancement varies
with the nature of the reactant in the host phase and with its concentration. As an example,
convective fingers are more intense and appear earlier than in non-reactive systems as soon =
as CO) reacts with the hydroxide base to produce a denser salt. This effect is stronger for the : 3
series LiOH < NaOH < KOH < CsOH [53]. This effect can be understood on the basis of density 12
