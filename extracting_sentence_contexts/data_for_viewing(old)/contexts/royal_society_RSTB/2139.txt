of its enamel cap is fairly constant. And in the tooth germ, when once a skin of
dentine is calcified, we get a measure of the width of the dentine at the level of the
shoulder, and also of the length of the pointed apex of the dentine which is contained
within the enamel cap; and these dimensions will not be altered by any subsequent
growth, as all the addition to the dentine takes place on its interior. A large finished
tooth measured 6°3 mm. in length; its enamel cap was 738 » in length, and the
dentine at the shoulder was 300 p in width, and entered the enamel cap for a distance
of 330 n. Now the width of the dentine cap at the shoulder in the tooth germ
figured (fig. 3) very nearly corresponds to the above-given measurements of a completed
tooth, so that it is fair to assume that the enamel cap would, when formed, have been
about 730 p in length.

As a matter of fact, the distance from the shoulder to the interior of the tooth sac
above it is 670 2, this space being occupied by the reticulated stroma before alluded
to. Hence it is fair to say that, even at this early period, when little enamel has yet
been formed, the reticulated stroma has attained to the full ultimate dimensions of
the enamel cap. In other words, in place of the enamel being manufactured by the
ameloblasts, so to speak, from hand to mouth as in mammals, a preparation is made
for it by the development of an organic stroma of its full dimensions, the corre-
spondence in measurements being quite as close as could be expected in a much
manipulated decalcified section.

Thus, the stroma into which the ameloblasts become transformed is exceedingly
thick over the area where enamel is to be formed, but the enamel organ is continued
down below the shoulder, tapering down almost to a thin edge when it reaches the
