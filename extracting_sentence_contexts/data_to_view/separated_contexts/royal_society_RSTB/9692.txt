Bars show the mean of the standardized frequency of behaviour. Standardization was done by subtracting the mean from each data point and dividing by the
standard deviation. Error bars are given by the standard error of the standardized frequency of behaviours. (e) Unrelated helpers (purple) provide more help than
related ones (green; [22]). (f) After subordinates have been prevented from giving help (dark blue), they compensate by increasing their previous help and sub-
mission level (light blue), presumably in an attempt to appease the breeder [19,25]. (g) Aggression levels in the group are normally very low (cream), but they
increase considerably when subordinates are experimentally prevented from helping (red; [25]).
