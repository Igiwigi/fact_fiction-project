It is, however, needless to describe minutely, appearances which
vary according to the brilliancy of the light, and which I cannot
undertake to explain.

to the common prismatic spectrum, it is blackened more in the violet than in any other
Kind of light. (4 66.) In repeating this experiment, I found that the blackness ex-
tended not only throygh the space occupied by the violet, but to'an equal degree, and
to about an equal distance, beyond the visible spectrum ; and that, by narrowing the
pencil of light received on the prism, the discoloration may be made to fall almost
entirely beyond the violet.

It would appear therefore, that this and other effects usually attributed to light, are
not in fact owing to any of the rays _usually- perceived, but to invisible rays that
accompany them ; and that, if we include two kinds that are invisible, we may distin=
guish, upon the whole, six species of rays into which a sun-beam is divisible by
refraction,

By eandle-light, a different set of appearances may be dis-
tinguighed, When a very narrow line of the blue light at the
lower part of the flame is examined alone, in the same manner,
