At some
point, the map becomes the territory, and the idiosyncratic
quirks of letter and colour that, to the synaesthete, are a
valued and cherished part of their perception of the world

understanding the experience itself. Here I advocate taking a
step back to understand and describe what synaesthetes do
in fact typically experience first, and to attempt to identify pat-
