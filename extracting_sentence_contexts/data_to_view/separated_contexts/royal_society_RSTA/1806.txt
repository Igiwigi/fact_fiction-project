All
strains belonging to Flavobacteriia (n = 10) were able to use the DOM provided by C. neogracilis,
and this exudate sustained a growth capacity of up to 100 times higher than diluted MB medium,
of two Pseudomonas sp. strains and one Sulfitobacter strain. In conclusion, using a simple model of interaction (one microalgal exudate/one bacterial
strain) to avoid complex biotic interactions which occur in microbial communities, we were able
to confirm that dissolved exudates from different microalgae differed in their bioavailability to
bacterial strains. Our results reinforce the fact that DOM can shape the bacterial community
composition by selecting the most responsive species having the right genetic material to degrade
the DOM at their disposal in their specific environment. Data accessibility. All DNA sequences were deposited in GenBank (NCBI) with accession nos.
