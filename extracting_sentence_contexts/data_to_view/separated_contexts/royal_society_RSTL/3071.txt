It must be allowed that
these conditions, which may be verified by innumerable instances between the two
limits, are vaguely defined ; and in order to ascertain the real meaning of the author,
recourse must be had to the algebraic expressions. When this is done it will be found
that the atmosphere intended is one of which the density is the product of two terms,
one taken from an arithmetical, and the other from a geometrical progression ; the
effect of which combination is to introduce a supernumerary constant, by means of
which the horizontal refraction is made to agree with the true quantity. No one will
deny the merit and the ingenuity of LapLacr's procedure; but though very skilful,
and guided in some degree by fact, it is liable to all the uncertainty of other arbitrary
suppositions, as indeed the author allows. Dr. BrinkLEy has given the character of
the French table fairly when he says, that it is only a little less empirical than the
other tables. On divesting LapLace's hypothesis of vagueness in the language, and
expressing it in the unequivocal symbols of algebra, it does not appear to possess any
superiority over other 8upposed constitutions of the atmosphere in leading to a better
and less exceptionable theory ; at least the Mec.
