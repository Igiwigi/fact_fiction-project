and probably less than the blue. The film is therefore pink, and remains pink down
to the dimensions of coloured glass for which p is of the order of 107°. The thin film
observed by Mr. Breripy was rose pink after annealing (p. 227).

The high transparency observed by FARADAY and by Mr. Brt.py corresponds to
the very small values of n*« for values of p< *5.

Consider next a thick film of gold.

The absorption being now, according to the result given on p. 409, dependent
principally upon the value of n«/k, we see from the table for v« or from the graph
that, for the solid metal, yellow light is less absorbed than red. The colour of thick
gold leaf is, in fact, olive-green by transmitted light. As » diminishes the absorption
of both yellow and red increases, the latter more rapidly. Now when p = ‘734, there
isa great absorption of red, according to the values of mx, which is intensified, since My
is for this value of n reduced to ‘177. The colour should then be more yellow than
red, and probably more blue than either. When p is < ‘7, the colour is much more
red than yellow. If our assumed curve for n« for blue is correct, the-colour of the
film should be blue between p» = ‘85 and ‘7, purple at ‘7, and principally red from
p = ‘65 through all the range of values of » from gold glass down to p = 0. (If our
curve for blue is correct, the figure shows that the film is red when the blue curve
crosses the yellow.)

According to Mr. Brrisy, a gold film, originally green, turned blue-purple after
annealing. Gold leaf turned, by annealing, pink with brown-green patches, the
