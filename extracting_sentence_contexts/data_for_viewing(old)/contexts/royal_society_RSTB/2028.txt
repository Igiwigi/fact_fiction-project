enclosing the lower part of the floral scape, this also storing nutriment ; in the centre
is the bud, which will expand into tunic, foliage leaves, and Hower the next year,
while their bases will accumulate reserve material during the assimilating period
to form fresh succulent scales, and so on (figs. 1 and 2). The bulb-scales last only
one year as reserve organs, and not, as in the case of Narcissus, for a longer period.
The buds, which give rise to new bulbs, usually arise in the axils of the tunics, one
to each.

Such are the general external features of a bulb, gathered from the examination of
nearly a thousand of them. Other details were noticed, such as the presence in a
few bulbs of an extra scale, suggestive of the vestige of a second tunic, also an occa-
sional one with the axis considerably lengthened between the scales and the new
bud, in fact, drop-bulbs.

Histology of the Bulb.—Transverse and longitudinal sections of a bulb-scale reveal
the following characters (see fig. 4) :—

(1.) Two epidermal layers composed of small cells, elongated in a longitudinal
direction. The one limiting the scale on the outer side represents really the
morphological lower surface of the leaf, and the other on the inner surface the
upper surface of the leaf. They are referred to respectively as the outer and inner
epidermis,

(2.) A mass of storing (parenchymatous) tissue, enclosed between the two
epidermal layers.
