By varying several other experiments of the same kind, precisely similar results
were obtained.

From the foregoing results obtained by the excitation method, it may be justly
concluded that the normal relationship of any given posterior root (sensori-motor
reflex) to the segments in the spinal cord is that the destination of its root-fibres is
nerve centres in segments below the point of entry into the spinal cord. It now
remains to see how far this generalisation is justified by other facts obtained in other
ways.

In the first place, the fact is of much interest that as long ago as 1847 CLAUDE
BERNARD found that the 6th and 7th posterior lumbar roots supplied the 7th anterior
root. Another point in the same direction is the fact that if the lumbar region be
cut across, then stimulation of the posterior external column, as high as the margin
of the cut surface of the lower portion, will give as intense a movement as before
section.

Finally, the fact that all observers are agreed that, by the method of excitation of
the anterior roots, the highest segment in the spinal cord from which movements
have been elicited in the lower limb is the second. The experiments in the present
investigation show that excitation of the cord as high as the 13th dorsal posterior
segment evokes movements in the lower limb, This apparent discrepancy is, it will
be seen, a proof of the position just advanced, since it shows that the uppermost
nerve centre containing motor representation of the lower limb received afferent
impulses by means of the posterior root, which is two or three segments higher
