null-hypothesis.

It should be noted that, in this paper, in order to guarantee generality and replicability, in the
synthetic data experiments, we characterized every method for every threshold using metrics
that are built on ROC curves (i.e. based on testing every possible threshold). The choice of the
threshold in the in vivo experiment was made consciously and in line with current neuroscience
literature, where the threshold is often imposed arbitrarily in order to ease physiological
interpretation of the results which survive it. In general, it is important to point out that statistics
for guiding acceptance/rejection of a link can be easily added to our method either through
surrogate data generation and analysis [67,68], or possibly through analytical definition of e.g.
a p-value for the estimated causality strength [1].

Also, situations can arise where separability (i.e. the fact that information in the causative
signal is independently unique and can therefore be removed by eliminating that signal from
the model) is not guaranteed. In such cases, general assumptions underlying any GC framework
will not be met, and in the presence of weak coupling this can lead to erroneous GC estimation.
In such cases, convergent cross mapping approaches [69] can provide a valid alternative. In
summary, ES-GC performs significantly better than commonly used and recently developed GC
detection tools, even in complex networks with nonlinear signals and weak coupling, making it
a valid tool for the analysis of e.g. multivariate biological networks. Future work will address the



incorporation of structural priors from e.g. diffusion MRI [70] as well as the reformulation through
recent, more sophisticated NN architectures (e.g. combinations of ESN and LSTM models [71])
