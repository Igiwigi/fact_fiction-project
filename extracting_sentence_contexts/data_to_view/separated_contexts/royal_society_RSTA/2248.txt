Griffiths certain collection of observables, not all of which
are compatible. A simple example shows that such
a joint probability distribution can exist even in
a situation where the measurement probabilities
cannot refer to properties of a quantum system,
and hence lack physical significance, even though
mathematically well defined. It is noted that the
quantum sample space, a projective decomposition of
the identity, required for interpreting measurements
of incompatible properties in different runs of an
experiment using different types of apparatus, has a
tensor product structure, a fact sometimes overlooked. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Contextuality
and probability in quantum mechanics and beyond’. Keywords:
contextual, measurement, Bell, quantum
sample space, incompatible properties
