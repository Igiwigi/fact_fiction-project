So if you have a volume of micro-structure in
front of the crack it could be made representative of these properties. Question 5

Adrian Sutton Ishare Eunan’s [McEniry] concern about what goes into a cohesive zone
model. I have always been very puzzled by the fact that engineers like
to put in a lot of plasticity on top of a purely atomistic process. If you
do a DFT calculation of cleavage of a plane in an ideal crystal without
hydrogen, take iron for example and cleave it on a (110) plane, you'll get
the energy as a function of the separation of that plane, and from that
you can calculate what the ideal cleavage stress will be and it will be a
sensible number, in the order of tens or hundreds of GPa. Then, if you
distribute some hydrogen on that plane it will reduce this ideal cleavage
energy by a factor of maybe two or ten, but that’s all the information
you need.
