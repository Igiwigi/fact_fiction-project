the production of which, as mentioned in the commencement of this paper, I have in
vain attempted by the action of the phenyl-alcohol at high temperatures upon aniline.

The view which I propose in the preceding remarks respecting the constitution of
toluidine, xylidine and cumidine, must as yet be considered as a mere hypothesis.
It will not however be difficult to establish it by facts. The action of bromide of
ethyl upon these substances will at once decide this question. These bases, when
subjected to the influence of the bromides, will give rise to the formation of a series
of bases similar to those which I have obtained from aniline. I may mention that
the deportment of toluidine and cumidine, in this respect, is now being studied by
several of iy pupils. There is no difficulty in introducing 1 equiv, of ethyl into tolu-
idine; the experiments are however not yet sufficiently advanced as to affirm also
D the insertion of the second equivalent. The alkaloid obtained by acting with bro-
mide of ethyl upon toluidine is represented by the formula

namely, ethylotoluidine, methylethylaniline and cumidine; and here I cannot but
