Trans. vol. 147, for 1857, pp. 745-803, the theorem being the
third example, p. 794. The method is similar to that of, and was in fact suggested by,
LeJguxe-DiRIcHLev; the auxiliary theorem made use of in the memoir of 1857 for the
representation of the discontinuity being

= J..\, | 4 dvds cos{(a—a—ts)v+4intv's f(a),

which is a deduction from Fourter's theorem
Changing the notation (and in particular writing s and 4s+g for his 7 and 7) the
method is here applied to the determination of the s-tuple integral
