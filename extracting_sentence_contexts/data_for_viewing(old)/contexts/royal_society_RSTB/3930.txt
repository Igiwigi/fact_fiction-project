traced on this. Serial sections can be thrown on to the same field one after the
other, and any structure can be traced with accuracy through any number of
sections. I have thus been able to make projections in all three planes, following out
the course of the vessels through every section, A most accurate and complete
drawing can thus be made, and every connection and branch traced throughout its
course. Serial sections of a complete segment were cut in paraflin, after fixation in
formol-Miiller, and stained with Mayer's acid heemalum and eosin in the ordinary

way. The fact that the hemoglobin of the leechâ€™s blood is in solution, and that the
blood therefore takes the eosin stain very strongly, makes the tracing of vessels,
when containing blood, a matter of no difficulty.

The finer details of the structure of the vessel walls, the valves, ete., have all been
taken from serial sections, primarily made for tracing nerves, which had been fixed in
formol-Miiller solution, embedded in gelatine (15), cut frozen and stained with
heemalum and Sudan IIT.

This method eliminates all shrinkage from the preparations and enables the
structure of the muscle fibres to be more accurately observed. The results obtained
from paraftin sections have also been confirmed in this series.
