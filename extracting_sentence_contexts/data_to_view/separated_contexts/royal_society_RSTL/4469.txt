In those experiments it was found that the additional rivet gave an
increase of 26 per cent. over those obtained from the single rivets; a cireumstance
which suggested a further extension of the experiments, accompanied with a minute
investigation of the parts, in order to ascertain their relative strengths, and the
strongest form of joint. The mean breaking weights of equal sections of single-riveted joints, as given in
Table VI. and taken from nine experiments, are respectively as follows :â€”

1bs.

23,127

16,107

18,982

19,147
giving a mean of 18,590 Ibs. for the strength of single-riveted joints. Now in the
Second and third experiments, Table VII., with the rivets inserted in the shape of an
i80sceles triangle (which in fact is double riveting), and of equal sections to the speci-
mens in Table VI., the mean breaking weight is 23,035, which gives an excess of 4445,
or a ratio of 10 : 8 in fayour of the experiments recorded in Table VII. In the experiments (Table X.), the area of the section, taken through the line of the
rivet-holes, is :44 inch, or precisely equal to the section of the specimens experimented
upon in Table VI., in which the mean breaking weight is 18,590 Ibs. In these expe-
riments the breaking weight is 23,707 Ibs., which is rather more than that in Table IX.,
where the material had a smaller section, but having its dimensions exactly corre-
sponding with the proportions given above.
