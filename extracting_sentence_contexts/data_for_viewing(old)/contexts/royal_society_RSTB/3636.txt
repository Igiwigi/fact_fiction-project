glia sheath projecting into the lumen of the giant fibre, such as are often seen in
Arenicola and Lumbricus, are seldom met with in Halla or Aglaurides. The sheath
of the giant fibre in Halla is not blackened on treatment with osmic acid, it is
stained brown; it differs in this respect from that of several other Cheetopoda.
Scuutze (1879, p. 106) was apparently the first to definitely record the blackening
of the sheath of the giant fibre, using that of Zambricus, on treatment with osmic
acid, an observation confirmed by VieNnaL (p. 384), FrrepLAnper (1891, p. 247),
and ScHNemeR (1902, p. 399). LancerHans (1880, p. 91) first observed this
blackening action of osmic acid on the sheath of the giant fibre of a Polycheete—
Prionospio, and subsequently similar action of this acid on the corresponding structure
in Mastobranchus was observed by FrrepLANDER (pp. 223-225), and in Clymene and
Axiothea by Lewis (p. 232). Several of these authors have drawn attention to the
fact that myelin or a myelin-like substance is present in the sheath of the giant
fibres which they examined. But there can be little or none of this substance in the
giant fibre sheath of Halla and Arenicola, for osmic acid has little darkening effect
on the substance of the sheath in either of these cases.

After prolonged trial observations on various Annelids I decided that, of these,
Halla afforded the best opportunities for the investigation of the giant cells and
giant fibres. Preparations were made according to the method of Gotat, but without
the least success, a result identical with that obtained by von Lennosskx, Reratus
