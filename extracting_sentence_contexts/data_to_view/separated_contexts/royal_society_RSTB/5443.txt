The precipitate is then
filtered on a kieselguhr filter, prepared as described on page 19, washed, dried, peeled
from the filter paper and the mixture of ferric hydroxide and kieselguhr analysed in
the usual apparatus.

(39) Carbon unaccounted for—This class, which includes the majority of the non-
volatile neutral compounds, including particularly the polyhydric alcohols and other

neutral compounds, has proved of particular interest. A comparatively large
figure in this class is an indication that the fungus in question is worthy of further
experimental investigation, since it indicates the production in appreciable quantities
of some, possibly new, fermentation compounds, by the micro-organism under
investigation. In interpreting the results obtained, however, care must be taken not
to overlook the fact that lactic acid is included with the non-volatile neutral compounds
(see page 23). The figure “ Carbon unaccounted for” is, of course, not an experimental one, but
is obtained by subtracting from the total carbon in solution (3) the sum of the carbon in
the sub-classes (8a), (3b), (3c), (3d), (3e) and (3f). In concluding this section it should be said that it is necessary to keep a strict check
on all reagents used during the analysis, and blank estimations were therefore made on
all samples of chromic and sulphuric acids used in the wet combustion method, correc-
tions being made later for the carbon found.
