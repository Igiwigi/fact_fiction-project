curve at 89°, the change in slope being from 5-6° per min. to about 7-3° per min. Our
observations between 80° and 100° are therefore in better agreement with those of
Miss LEHMANN than with the corresponding data of Jerrreys’s tables. The fact that the
kink occurs at 86° in our case and 89° in Miss Lenmann’s observations is of course

explained by the difference in focal depth. A corresponding bend should occur in the
sS curve at about 93°, but the observations fail at about this distance.
