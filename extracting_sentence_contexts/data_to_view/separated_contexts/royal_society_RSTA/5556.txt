The identical values given for the differences in the case of water ave especially
Boteworthy, as the molecular complexity of water is supposed to alter as the tempe-
pt fille.

& 1t has already been shown that the molecular visvosities of the acids—which, like
Ayater, aré also supposed to contain molecular aggregates—are related to those of the
Ether liquids in practically the same way at the two slopes. These points are of the
