These results indicate that neurons and astrocytes
complexity to the ECB signalling effects. communicate via ECB signalling and suggest the existence of

intercellular communication pathways mediated by ECB-—
glutamate signalling in which astrocytes serve as a bridge for
non-synaptic interneuronal communication (figure 1).

2. Endocannabinoid signalling in neuron — The presence of functional CB1Rs that, upon activation,

astrocyte communication evoke astrocyte Ca?* elevations in situ has also been recently
demonstrated in human brain tissue [36], suggesting that

ECB-mediated neuron-astrocyte signalling and its functional
consequences, originally observed in rodents, are also present
in human brain. The fact that astrocytes express functional
CB1Rs has important implications for our current under-
standing of the cellular basis of the behavioural effects of
exogenous cannabinoids and ECBs. For years, the existence and role of CB1Rs in astrocytes has
been a controversial issue. Earlier studies showed discre-
pancies in the expression of CB1Rs by astrocytes in culture
(see [30]), which could arise from the well-known pheno-
typic changes in astrocytes in different culture conditions.
