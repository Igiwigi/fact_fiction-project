Here then, in the decomposition of iodide of triethylammonium by metallic oxides,
we are obliged by irresistible evidence to acknowledge those very two stages, the
assumption of which in the analogous change of iodide of ammonium appeared to
us deficient in simplicity and probability. The conception of ammonium does not in any way imply the notion that the differ-
ent hydrogen-atoms united with nitrogen in the molecule of the compound metal,
retain their position in the molecular system with equal persistency. We are forced
by unequivocal facts to admit that the fourth atom of hydrogen is in a peculiar state
of mobility, and it is on the facility with which this fourth atom is dislodged from its
position that one of the foundations of the ammonia-theory rests. In the compound
ammoniums the mobility of the fourth atom of hydrogen, or the hydrocarbon re-
placing it, still prevails, although less 80 than in the type itself. The decomposition
of the ammonium-bases under the influence of heat is particularly instructive in this
respect ; oxide of tetrethylammonium loses the fourth equivalent of ethyl in the form
of olefiant gas and water; and this deportment might be graphically indicated by
writing the formula of this compound in accordance with the ammonia-theory, namely,
thus—
