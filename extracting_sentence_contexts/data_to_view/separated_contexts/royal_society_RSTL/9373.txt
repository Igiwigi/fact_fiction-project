SECTION,

$ 1,—Allusion has already been made to the fact that in the contractile tissues of
Avurelia there are frequently to be observed immense differences in the force of the
contractions, according as the latter are originated by a strong or by a weak stimula-
tion ; that is to say, while a stimulus which is not below some certain degree of inten-
sity will always start a wave of strong contraction from any point of the tissue area
which may be chosen as the seat of stimulation, a weaker stimulus may start a wave
of contraction 80 feeble as to be scarcely perceptible. In some specimens of Aurelia
these waves of feeble contraction are more easily produced than in other specimens,
and occasionally it happens that they are 80 feeble as to be only rendered perceptible
by raising the tissue above the water and inclining the head at such an angle to their
level as admits of the eye receiving the reflection of light which falls upon their
glancing surface; as a response to each feeble stimulus a slight change in the glancing,
indicative of a slight contraction, may then be observed. It might reasonably be supposed that snch feeble waves of contraction would not
present much power of radiating through extensive areas of tissue; but, as a matter of
fact, they often travel quite as far and well as do the stronger waves. Indeed, it not
unfrequently happens that they gain strength as they advance; 80 that in a long 8trip
of tissue—especially if a large piece of the umbrella be left attached to the end remote
from stimulation—it may happen that a contractile-wave, when started by a feeble
stimulus at one end of the strip, is barely perceptible at that end, while it grows into
a tolerably strong contraction towards the other end. When I first observed the occurrence of these almost imperceptible waves of con-
traction it appeared to me that they might possibly serve to explain the occurrence of
what in my previous paper I called waves of stimulation.
