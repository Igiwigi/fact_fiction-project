The facts detailed by Harvey had shown that the left side of the heart was
endued with less irritability than the right ; the experiment of Hook, that re-
spiration restored the action of the heart, if it had previously ceased ; that of
Goopwvyn, that this cessation and restoration of functions were observed in
the left side of the heart. It was obvious, on the other hand, that the re-
spiration belongs, as it were, to the left side of the heart. It appears plainly deducible from these facts, that in circumstances and
structures the most similar, the respiration is accurately inyersely as the irri-
tability. For the sake of a comparison with the hybernating animal, the object of
which will be explained hereafter, I thought it right to repeat this experi-
ment. Before I proceed to detail the result, I may just describe an easy method of
performing that part of it which consists of artificial respiration.
