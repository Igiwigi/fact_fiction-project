about 0-06-inch diameter and shaped like oyster shells.* This tendency to flake at
the surface is also observed when glass is broken by bending. This was particularly
well shown in the specially prepared fibres used for the experiments described in the
present paper. In almost all cases of flexural fracture the crack curled round on
approaching the compression side, till it was nearly parallel to the surface. On two
occasions the fracture divided before changing direction, the two branches going
opposite ways along the fibre and a flake of length several times the diameter of the
fibre was detached.

Surface flaking is also observed when some kinds of steel are subjected to repeated
stress. Here the flakes are usually very small.

All these facts are evidently in complete agreement with the “ surface layer” theory
and, indeed, it is difficult to account for them on any other basis.

8. Extended Application of the Molecular Orientation Theory.

On the basis of the present theory, the physical properties of materials must be
intimately related to the geometrical properties of the molecular sheet-formation. In
order that a substance may exhibit the characteristic properties of crystals, it is clearly
necessary for the sheets of molecules to be plane. In this case the crystals are, of
course, the molecule groups or “ units” referred to above. In “ amorphous” materials,
on the other hand, the sheets are probably curved.f

In materials of the former type, there must exist planes on which, if they are subjected
