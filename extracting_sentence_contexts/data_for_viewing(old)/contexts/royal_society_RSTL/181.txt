which it imparted a yellow tinge.

It seems probable, from the general tenor of these facts,
that the new substance is a compound of azote and chlorine;
the same as, or analogous to, that mentioned in the letter
from Paris. It is easy to explain its production in our experi-
ments: the hydrogen of the ammonia may be conceived
to combine with one portion of the chlorine to form muriatic
acid, and the azote to unite with another portion of chlorine
to form the new compound. The heat and light produced
during its expansion into gaseous matter, supposing it to be
composed of azote and chlorine, is without any parallelinstance,
in our present collection of chemical facts ; the decomposition
of euchlorine, which has been compared to it, is merely an
expansion of matter already gaseous. The heat and light pro-
duced by its rare≈øaction, in consequence of decomposition, '
depend, probably, on the samecause as that which produces the
flash of light in the discharge of the air gun.


of a new detonating Compound. 7

The mechanical force of this compound in detonation, seems
to be superior to that of any other known, not even excepting
the ammoniacal fulminating silver. The velocity of its action
