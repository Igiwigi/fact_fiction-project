being Z=—F X?), and on the second surface a triple line (equations in vicinity being
1+ 1, p 14 _ :
Z=yX? and *=4 7), But /=—pX* touches Z=yX?, and the line counts thus

(2+2=) 4 times.

107. I say that the complete intersection is the line (X=0, Z=0) three times
together with a spinode curye made up of this same line once and of the curye of the
eighth order; and that thus o=9.

The discussion of the reciprocal surface in fact shows that the reciprocal of the edge
is a singular line thereof, counting once as a nodal and twice as a cuspidal line thereof;
the cuspidal tangent planes are the reciprocals of the several points of the edge, and
the edge is thus part of the spinode curye. The reasoning may appear to show that
the edge should be counted twice, but it must be counted once only, making the order
=9 as mentioned.

108. I find that the octic component of the spinode curve is a unicursal curve, the
equations of which may be written

X:Y:Z:W=168: 49+166: 169: —5—86'—166;
the values of 5 at the binode B, are 6=0, 6=<o, and we thus obtain in the neigh-
bourhood thereof the two branches
