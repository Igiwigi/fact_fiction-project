found unfit for food. The oral opening, instead of projecting, was then drawn down
below the level of the coat, and depressed it; the cilize being alsoat such times closely
stretched across the openings of the spiracles (4). Whenever the cilize stopped their
action, they were seen to be very numerous and appeared almost as a continuous
membrane.

The conveyance of the food from the different parts of the mouth to the stomach
by an even progress, and without any muscular act of swallowing, remained as my-
sterious as before.

No note was taken of the existence of alternations in the circulation of this poly-
clinum ; and I cannot now assert it as a fact, though I believe it to be 80. It would
be interesting to trace the limits of that phenomenon in the animal kingdom Â®.

No indication of a nervous system was noticed in either of these Ascidic; and not
being previously prepared for the investigation by reading the labours of others, it
did not occur to me to look for it.

It may assist towards establishing the place of Cellularia and Flustra to add some

These all appeared to belong to one natural family, far higher in its organization
than the tubular polypi, with which some of its members are even yet associated.
