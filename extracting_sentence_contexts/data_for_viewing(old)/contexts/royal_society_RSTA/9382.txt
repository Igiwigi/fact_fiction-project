PART III.

§ 22.. I desire to add to the foregoing some very incomplete remarks in regard to a
generalisation of which the work appears to be capable. The most important general
result obtained is that when w is a periodic matrix, the matrix ((w) can be expressed

aus a periodic matrix P multiplied into a matrix involving quantities of the form e”.
One direction in which this result can be amplified is by extending the assumption
Swe have made that the matrix Q,"(w) has linear invariant factors. It is well enough
understood what is the character of the modifications thereby introduced. A more
important generalisation appears to be that the factorisation of the matrix Q(u)
‘odoes not in fact require that u be a periodic matrix. As an indication of the theorem

consider an equation
