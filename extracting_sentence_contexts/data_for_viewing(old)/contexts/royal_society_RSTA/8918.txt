28 MR. J. H. JEANS ON THE INSTABILITY OF THE PEAR-SHAPED

My value of Ak® having been seen to be —0°079156e,’, it follows that Darwin's
ought to be
Ak = 0°10390e;? = 0°18317e,°
so that his value of 4° as deduced from my calculations ought to be
k? = 0'8441 (14+0°15777e,’).
In point of fact the value actually given by Darwin was
Kk? = 0'°8441 (14 0°157786e,.).

It appears, then, that DArw1n’s moment of momentum agrees exactly with mine,
as it ought, except for the difference introduced by the different values we have taken
for vn”. But, besides showing this, the calculations just given provide a check on the
accuracy of the computations of both of us. Although our figures, as far as the
second order, have been calculated by very widely different methods, their moments
of momentum have been found to agree very closely.*

21. The moment of momentum in the cylindrical problem was announced in my
two-dimensional paper to increase with increasing e’.
