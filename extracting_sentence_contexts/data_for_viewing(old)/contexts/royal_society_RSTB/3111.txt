At present very few experiments have been made with wounded leaves. ‘Those
made by HaBerLANpDT* have been discussed above (p. 247).

In discussing intumescences in his ‘ Pflanzenanatomie,’ Kister treats chiefly of
those on leaves, passing with a few words over those on stems (which, however,
he notes are formed on the sunny side of the stem), because he regards intumescences
as typical “ hypertrophies,” 7.¢c., enlarged tissues in which the increase in size is due
to dilatation of pre-existing cells and not to cell-division. Consequently, he regards
the cases recorded by Soraver,t in which cell-division takes place, as an exception
to the rule. Apparently he assumes the structure of intumescences in leaves and
on stems to be always the same. But it seems to me that the difference between
hypertrophy and hyperplasy is one of degree only, and therefore non-essential. In
fact, Kister himself{ says that in higher plants the cells of any tissue which can
form a hypertrophy can also form a hyperplasy, and that no distinct line can be
drawn between the two. Internal and external factors, he says, determine whether
a hypertrophy or a hyperplasy will be formed. Other hypertrophic (or hyperplastic)
tissues also show similarities in structure to intumescences and callus, notably galls,
whether due to vegetable or animal parasites.

Another tissue closely related to intumescences and to wound-eallus is the abnormal
growth which takes place in lenticels, and which is formed under the same conditions.
This also I hope to consider further in a subsequent paper.

The function of wound-callus is twofold—it heals the wound by covering it with
new cells, and it provides a meristemmatic tissue from which adventitious roots and
