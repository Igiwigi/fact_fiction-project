-S higher aboye the abscisza ; this is well shown in Plates 68, 69, figs. 10 and 17 A. This diminution of
© relaxation between the beats may be dne to an increased tonicity of the ventricle, coincident with the
S increase in the force of the contractions, or it may be cansed mechanically by the arrangement of the
© apparatus. Thus, when the clamp is not very tight the movements of both anricle and ventricle aro
A transmitted mechanically through the clamp to the other side, 80 that the contraction of the ventricle nob
only pulls the lower lever upwards bnt also slightly moves the upper lever downwards, and the reverse
with the contractions of the auricles ; therefore, if the ventricular contraction comes before the auricular
lever has reached its lowest position of relaxation, then the pull of the ventricle will not only prevent
the auricular lever falling any lower but will also increasc the 8ize of the nexb auricular contraction,
This mechanical influence of the ventricular contractions is seen in snch cases as Plate 68, fig. 14, where
the ventricular beats have produced the appearance of strong and weak beats in the auricular curye,
T6 is Poxsible then to explain the rise in the diastolic line, both of auricles and ventricle, which
often occurs after stimnlation of the vagus nerve by the fact that owing to the increase in the force of
the contractions, a stronger mechanical effect is produced upon the contractions of that part of the heart

which is situated on the opposite side of the clamp. That this will help to explain many of the cages of
diminished relaxation after vagus stimulation there can be no doubt. Still, I have 8een cases in which
such an explanation does not seem 8ufficient, especially when the ventricle is beating with alternately
strong and weak beats. S
