In the earlier discussions of this problem, it has been tacitly assumed that it was
only necessary to find forces sufficient to balance a head of water equal to the height
of the loftiest tree to explain the ascent of sap in it. The problem is, however, rather
one of dynamics than of staties, for we have to find forces sufficient not only to
balance the head of water, but also to keep this water moving upwards in narrow
tubes with a velocity varying from a few centimetres to as much as 6 metres per hour. Janse has in fact shown empirically, and his results have been confirmed by
SrrasBurGER, that to drive water through the stem of a Conifer at the transpiration
rate requires a head of water several times the length of the stem. *

Water is a liquid of definite viscosity, and the resistance offered even to its slow
flow through tubes of small diameter and considerable length is a factor of great
importance. The purpose of the following research has been to find the amount of
this resistance in definite cases, the forces required to overcome it, and hence the total
force required to raise the water with sufficient rapidity to the summit of an actively
transpiring tall tree.
