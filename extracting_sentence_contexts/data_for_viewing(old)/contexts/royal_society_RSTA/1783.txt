ground sensing electrode is specified as ground along with holder and : =
substrate, with the electric potential of 0 V while the driving : 8
electrode has an applied potential of 1 V at 4.9 MHz : ra
zero charge boundary to simulate a perfectly insulating surface and is assigned to the outer : ra
domain boundary : S
floating potential boundary condition to simulate a perfectly conducting surface where both electrode : S

surfaces are assigned to this boundary condition

computation domain the size of the computation domain truncates the modelling space. In
fact, the fringing electric field extends to infinity, but drops off in
proportion to the inverse cube of the distance. They rapidly become
small enough to be considered numerically insignificant. Here, it is
verified that the computation domain is large enough to capture

the fringing fields
