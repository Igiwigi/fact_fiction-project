It is a singular fact, that these celebrated anatomists should both have as-
serted their claims to the merit of what they supposed to be the discovery of
the true structure of the human placenta, and its connexion with the uterus,
and that their controversy on this subject should have loosened those bonds of
affection which had united them together from their earlier years+.

Noorrwycn, Raperts, and Harres, bad previously investigated this sub-
ject by injecting the blood-yessels of the gravid uterus: their researches how-
ever did not determine, in a satisfactory manner, that a vascular connexion
exists between the uterus and cells in the placenta. 'The opinions of the
Huxrers were generally acquiesced in at the time they were promulgated,
and their accuracy has not been called in question by any anatomist of repu-
tation in this country ſor the Jast forty years.
