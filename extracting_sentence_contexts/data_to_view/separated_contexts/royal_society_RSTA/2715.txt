Wells’ famous 1895 novella The
Time Machine but, again, I do not believe he ever put his thoughts about that work down on paper
(with one possible exception, which I will mention later). So, I will feel free to speculate, but I will
also do my very best to keep one foot (or at least a toe) in the real world. Now, before we get down to business, let me end this opening section with the comment
that Heaviside has reminded some of his admirers of the eccentric, fictional scientist Haskel van
Manderpootz, professor of the ‘new physics’ (that is, relativity), who appeared in an hilarious
science fiction tale published 10 years after Heaviside’s death [4]. Compared to the ‘modest’ Van
Manderpootz (read Heaviside), all other physicists in the world are a mere ‘pack of jackals, eating
the crumbs of ideas that drop from [his] feast of thoughts’. This view might seem to cast Heaviside
in a less-than-flattering light, but in fact I do not believe he held that image of himself; rather, it
is a hagiographic view of the man that has gained some traction among his more enthusiastic
contemporary fans.
