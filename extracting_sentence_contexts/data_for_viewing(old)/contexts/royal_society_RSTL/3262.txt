be added, that I find one membrane to disappear by liquefaction within the ovum
while the latter is in the Fallopian tube.

From what has been stated, it will be obvious that in undertaking researches in 80
difficult a snbject as that of embryology, the mind should not be pre-occupied with
any theory. I certainly had none to establish. If I was at all prepossessed, it was in
favour of existing doctrines; and it has been in s$pite of such prepossession that fact
after fact has gradually but irresistibly compelled me to form other views. In the
following pages there will be found no speculations, as I have confined myself to a
simple delineation of appearances, and to the most obvious conclusions arising from
them. If in any points I have been mistaken, that indulgence will, I trust, be ac-
corded which may be fairly claimed in exploring one of the most hidden regions of
physiology. That in the main facts I have not erred seems probable, from the re-
peated opportunities afforded for their confirmation. The number of Rabbits ex-
amined considerably exceeds a hundred, and I have recorded in my notes the particular
results regarding eighty-nine. Besides ova that were till present in the ovary and
apparently destined to escape, ninety-three have been found in the Fallopian tube, and
two hundred and thirty-six in the uterns. I have kept a separate record of the
measurements and other particulars of most of these. Tables will be given (par. 319.),
showing the diameter, general condition, and locality, of two hundred and fifty-six
of the minuter of these oya, yery few of which exceeded in diameter half a Paris line,
and by far the greater number were considerably below this size, some indeed not ex-
ceeding th and even -;th of a Paris line. Of these ova I have preserved sixty-six.
The foregoing will serve to show that my conclusions have not been drawn from 80-
litary facts or isolated obseryations4Ã¾. ;
