fighting decoherence. In all current quantum computing attempts, the main difficulty results from 2 |
the fact that the thermal environment tends to thermalize a qubit, thereby causing decoherence.

This has the unwanted consequence of information scrambling: during thermalization, quantum a
information encoded in the initial state will spread over the entire system and thereby become 8
inaccessible to local measurements. This may not be the case in MBL systems: as a localized is
environment fails to thermalize, the system can retain some local information about its initial 1S

state for indefinite amounts of time, opening up new possibilities for quantum technologies.

2. History

Originally proposed by Anderson in 1958 [1], disorder-induced localization was initially mostly
