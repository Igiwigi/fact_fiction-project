These observations confirmed our opinion of the superiority of the electrometer

method. Results were sometimes obtained agreeing to about 0:5 per cent,, but
generally the difference was greater, and sometimes it was as large as 6 per cent. The
fact that the most discordant results were obtained with films which had exhibited
a considerable number of black specks ab the top shows the advantage of working
in the middle of the film. We may here remark that the effect of these black specks
upon the electrometer was carefully noted. They generally travelled round the film
ab varying speeds, and it was found that a gpeck much larger than was usnal was
required to produce any effect on the electrometer by its passage over the nearest
needle,

Observations with three Flectrometers.â€”Tt may be desirable to state why three
needles were used for the films rather than two.
