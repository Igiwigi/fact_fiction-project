4. Cercocebus.—C. collaris and C. fuliginosus again bear a close resemblance to
the Gibbon, as well as to the other Cercopithecide.

5. Cynopithecus.—C. niger (Black Ape) again no doubt on account of its dark
colour has a grey fundus similar to that of Cercopithecus diana, and the fundus being
dark, the reflex from the vessels and macula ring is very marked.

b. Arctopithect. (Plate 3.)

1. Hapalide.—The Hapales, or Marmosets have, to judge by the eye, been cor-
rectly placed by GApow in a separate sub-order. They have the fundus peculiar to
the strongly pigmented Old World Monkeys; but with a very large macula area—as
large in fact as Cercopithecus callitrichus, but with this difference, that the reflex ring
shows a play of prismatic colours—a peculiarity which I have only found in one other
animal, namely, in the Squirrel Monkey (Chrysothria sciureus), which occupies no doubt
the highest position in the next sub-order,

ce. Platyrhine, (Plate 4.)

The Platyrhines do not differ from the Catarhines to anything like the extent I
would have expected. My observations fully confirm Huxtry’s axiom as to the
similarity between Man and the other Simi, in contradistinction to the Prosimie,
but not HarcKEL’s view that the axiom can be restricted to the Catarhines alone.

1. Cebide.—At the head of the family I place the genus Chrysothrix, on account
