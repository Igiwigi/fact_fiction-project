parts of the science where the evidence is so strong as to warrant definitive conclusions. In

This potential connection with significant harms adds a moral dimension to the task of 12

uncertainty assessment in the climate context. If by taking a bit more care experts can produce
uncertainty reports that are substantially less likely to mislead decision-makers about the state
of climate knowledge, then it seems that they ought to do so. In fact, Douglas [27,28] has argued

recently that failing to take sufficient care in arriving at and reporting conclusions—including : &
