Figure 13 shows the predicted dependence of induction time tin for stoichiometric H2—O2
and CH4—O, mixtures on the E/N value at E; =0.5Jcm~?, To = 600K for Pp =0.1 and 1atm. For the analysis, different values of initial temperature Tp for mixtures under study were taken:
To = 600 K for the Hy—O2 mixture and Tp = 800 K for the CHy—Oy one. This is due to the fact that
hydrogen and methane possess distinguishing reactivity and ignition capability (for methane,
these characteristics are notably worth than those for hydrogen). It should be emphasized that
without activation of O2 molecules in electric discharge there is practically no ignition in the
Hy—Oy and CH4—Oy mixtures at such Tp and Po values, i.e. tin is very long. One can see that the
behaviour of tin(E/N) dependence for the stoichiometric H2—O2 and CH4—Oyz mixtures differs
significantly.
