On the basis of these observations we can
now form a simple picture of the processes that occur at the points of contact between
lubricated surfaces sliding at low speeds. It seems probable that the metal is deformed
plastically and flows until a joint is formed that is capable of supporting the load. The
fact that the track width (and hence the area of contact) is independent of the
lubricant and is the same whether lubricant is present or absent agrees with this
hypothesis. As a result of the deformation a film of the lubricant will be trapped
between the two metal surfaces and there subjected to very high pressures. The pres-

sure will, however, not be uniform in the region of contact but will be at a maximum
at the centre of this region and will fall off towards the perimeter.
