that exactly the same number of turns of each circuit could be short-circuited
without a connection being formed between one circuit and the other, these tests
may be taken as suflicient. The width of the grooves was made such that twelve
turns of wire, that is six turns of each circuit, just fitted in. There were eight
layers in each coil, and since the two circuits were always used in parallel this
gave 48 turns in each coil. After winding each layer it was given a coating of weak
shellac varnish, made by dissolving shellac in absolute aleohol. This varnish was
soaked up by the silk covering of the wire and served the purpose of preventing
the silk taking up moisture from the air and thus losing in part its insulating
properties. The wires joining the two coils were led along the cylindrical surface of
the coils in the same horizontal plain as the centre of the coils. In this position
these wires produce at the centre of the coils no magnetic field which has a
horizontal component, and hence the fact that they are distant from one another by
about 1 millim, from centre to centre can produce no error.

The insulation of the circuits was tested before and after the experiments and was
found to exceed 200 megohms both from one circuit to the other and from each of
the circuits to the flanges. The insulation of the rubber-covered leads and of
the Pohl commutator used to reverse the current was also tested and found
practically infinite.

The metal of which the flanges were cast was specially mixed by the founders so
as to avoid the presence of any iron, and these castings, as well as all metal used in
the construction of the coils, were carefully tested for magnetism by means of a
delicate magnetometer. The fact that the instrument is free from magnetism was
