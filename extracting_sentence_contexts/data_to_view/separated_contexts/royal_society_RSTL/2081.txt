known to contain water ; and I have little doubt that similar
effects would be produced by other fused salts containing
only acid and alkaline matter. It may elucidate this part of the subject, which must at best
be obscure, to take a view of the changes occurring in one of
the simplest voltaic combinations, that consisting of zinc,
platinum, and solution of sulphate of soda. It is a fact that
zine and platinum become electrical by contact, the zinc
positive, the platinum negative; and the two kinds of elec-
tricity are apparently most intense at the surfaces where they
are in contact with the fluid, which is too imperfect a con-
ductor to allow. them to neutralize or destroy each other :
they consequently exert their attractive and repellent powers
upon the elements of the menstruum ; acid and oxygen cir-
culate to the surface of zinc, which in consequence is dis-
solved, and alkali and hydrogen to the surface of platinum,
of which the hydrogen is disengaged, and the equilibrium
broken by the contact of the metals is restored by the che-
mical changes; so that a constant circulation, or a current of
electricity, takes place, the power of the combination becom-
ing Å¿eebler in proportion as. the solution is decomposed,
and acid accumulated round its positive, and alkali round
its negative surface.
