Question 1

Afrooz Barnoush Are you heating your hydrogen-charged zirconium pillars in vacuum
for the SEM experiments?

Ben Britton This is something we are sorting out. We are working within an
environmental SEM setup so we are about to back-charge with some
hydrogen to sort out the thermal degassing. However, looking at
thermal desorption spectroscopy, the degassing tends to happen at a
much higher temperature. But having a higher surface is very special
because all the size effects come in in a different way; that is one of
the caveats to worry about. Nevertheless, the fact that the hydrogen-
containing pillar is behaving differently to the virgin pillar at these
temperatures is still interesting.

Afrooz Barnoush Is there something special about zirconium?

Ben Britton Very much so. The nice thing about zirconium — as opposed to steel —
is that it is a hydride-forming metal, so a lot of hydrogen can be stored in
the bulk of that material. So we think there is still a lot of free hydrogen
and hence we only need to do something with a few dislocations to
change the deformation mode.
