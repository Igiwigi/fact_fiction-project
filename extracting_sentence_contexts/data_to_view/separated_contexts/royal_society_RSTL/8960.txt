ROMANES ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF MEDUSAX. 687

larity of the first of the above tracings with those published in his paper. It will be
remembered that he experimented on the physiologically severed apex of the heart.
and therefore on a tissxwe which, in the absence of any active ganglionic element.
regembles the paralyzed umbrella of Aurelia. His tracings were obtained in exactly
the same way as my own, 80 that the fact of tissues separated from one another in the
animal scale 80 widely as are the muscle-fibres of the heart and those of the Medus,
nevertheless behaving towards stimulation in 80 peculiar and yet 80 similar a manner, is
to my mind a fact of great interest. Dr. Bowprrcn does not appear to have deter-
mined the effect of what he conveniently terms the staircase action (from the appear-
ance of the tracings to a staircase) upon the period of latent stimulation ; but from the
fact that in other respects the case of the heart and that of the Medusz are 80 similar,
there can be little doubt that in the former, as in the latter, the latent period will be
found to be greatly influenced by a series of stimuli.
