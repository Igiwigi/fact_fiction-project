In general, given a family of transition probability matrices P(x, y) with entries
in xo, if the generalized Markov problem for it has a positive solution, the centre of the associated
Schwinger algebra will be an abelian extension of ko. The fact that two families of transition
probability matrices with entries in «9 admit Schwinger algebra models with isomorphic centre
is an equivalence relation among such families and the common centre « can be considered as a
statistical invariant of the equivalence class. The name ‘generalized Markov problem’ is justified by the fact that this is the quantum
probabilistic analogue of the following, well-known, problem in classical probability: given a
family of (real-valued) transition probability matrices {P(s, t):s <t,s,t}, when does there exist a
Markov process (A(t)) such that, for each s < t, the transition matrix canonically associated to the
pair of random variables A(s), A(t) is P(s, t)? It is well known that the classical probabilistic problem has a positive solution if and only if
the family of transition probability matrices (P(s, t)) satisfies the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation:

P(r,s)- P(s,f)=P(r,t), 1r<s<t. (3.31)

In concrete applications of Markov processes the above equation has a natural interpretation as
(typically irreversible) time evolution of a classical system. However, from a mathematical point
of view (3.31) arises only as a compatibility condition for a set of transition probabilities to admit
a specific probabilistic model (Markov in this case).
