Similarly, X,,. gives «,', the coefficient being ,;(0,'+2), and so forth. Of the Y equations, that determining @,° is obtained from X, by the operator A). It is, in fact, Y,_,

The coefficient of y%' in Y,-p4: is equal to the coefficient of 2,' in X,-p4, with @,’,
6’, ..., substituted for 0,1, 0,!, .... But X,-,4, vanishes identically as far as 0,' is
concerned and @,*, ..., are the same as 0,°, ..... Thus Y,-,41 is independent of y,’.
