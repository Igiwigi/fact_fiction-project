salmon in the Sydenham River is relatively short and not nearly
as difficult as those in systems such as the Columbia, Fraser or
the Yukon River where the salmon may migrate over 1000 km
upriver to reach natal spawning grounds. As such, we might
predict that such differences would be even more apparent
during more arduous migrations. Regardless, our study
builds on the substantial amount of evidence suggesting that
hatchery fish are not a like-for-like replacement for wild fish.

(c) Temperature effects on fy

The fi: in migrating adult Chinook salmon tended to increase
with water temperature, which is consistent with the fact that
the elevation in metabolic rate and tissue oxygen demand
with warming necessitates an elevation in cardiac output,
which in teleosts is achieved primarily through elevations in
fr and secondarily by adjustments to stroke volume [16,55].
For instance, peak fj; in sockeye salmon increased progress-
ively with warming (being lowest at 16°C and highest at 21°
C) [46,7]. Beyond thermal optima, cardiovascular collapse is
common, which is primarily driven by the insufficient scope
for fr: [5,13,74]. While temperatures in the Sydenham River
were not beyond thermal optima for the species, there is sub-
stantial evidence that populations differ in their thermal
tolerance based on local conditions [75]. As temperatures
