The corollary to theorem 9-1 says that if a U-basic set is effective for an ¥,-space F in Z,,
then it is a base for F. Theorem 9-3 may be interpreted to mean that, given two bases on an
F,-space, the formulae relating the co-ordinates relative to the two bases are those obtain-
able, as in the algebraic theory, by straightforward formal calculation. This remark
emphasizes the fact that in order to change the base, and a fortiori in order to discuss basic
series, we must have a base to start with. Now contrary to what happens in the algebraic
theory, it is false in general that every linear topological space has a base. We could, in fact,
have proved theorem 1-1 without the hypothesis that the topology is locally convex, by
using max d (3 E(x) x, 0) instead of max Zz &,(x) af while, on the other hand, there
