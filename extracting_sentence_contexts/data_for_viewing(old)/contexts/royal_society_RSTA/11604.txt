Hydrogen does not appear in this table, as no regular rain-like condensation was
observed.

Tt will be noticed that the supersaturation required to cause condensation is
practically the same in CO, as in the other gases, in spite of the great difference
in v/v}.

The supersaturation is in each case the greatest which can exist at the temperature
t,° C. without condensation resulting.

To find to what extent this depends upon the temperature, we may make use of
the fact that v,/2, when the resulting supersaturation is just sufficient to cause
condensation, is in the case of air constant for temperatures between 15°5°C.
and 288°C,
