the various loci connected with the original transformation degenerate for this case.
Chords of the composite curve are of three kinds: (a) chords of c;, which generate the
space II in which c; lies; (6) chords of c,, which are the lines of the plane « in which
C, lies; (c) lines meeting c, and ¢,. Now it requires only one condition to make a
®-quadric contain the whole plane « ; so that to all points of « correspond the same
point Oof ©. Hence the locus of chords of ¢;, M,°, breaks up in the present case into the
solid Il and a quartic primal M,*, generated by lines meeting c, and cs, and having the
former of these as triple and the latter as double curve. ‘To chords of ¢; correspond in
= points of a plane c containing the point 0: for any plane 4 of = meets o in one
point, namely that corresponding to the chord of c, which completes the section by I
of the ®-surface corresponding to %; and since one chord of cs, namely O, Os, lies in
#, ¢ must contain the point O. Thus F,’ must break up into this plane o and a surface
of order four F,* corresponding to M,‘. F,‘ is in fact the general quartic rational
ruled surface* in [4]; and its generators correspond, as in the general case, to cubic

* In the “ Encyk. der Math. Wiss.,” III, c. 7, p. 518, note 452, Szare records three properties of this
surface F,*, each of which, as will be shown, has a special significance in this connection. These properties
are :—

(a) F,4 has a single node through which pass two of its generators.

(b) F,4 contains oc! plane cubics having nodes at O and lying in one system of planes of the quadric

cone which projects the surface from O.
(c) F,* contains ! directrix conics.
