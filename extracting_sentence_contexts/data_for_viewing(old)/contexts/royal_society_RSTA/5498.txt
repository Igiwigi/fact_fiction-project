order three-dimensional printing of forming insert kits (according to the generated WTP) [24].

A list of alternative equipment for performing each unified operation is established and
priorities are assigned. In particular, for the post-processing operation, the equipment options.
are the HAAS Super Mini Mill and Primacon PFM 24NGD milling machines [34,35]. Numerical
control programs (NC-program) for CNC machines are formed with the assignment of certain
cutting modes for each forming insert material. These NC-programs are based on the unified
procedure templates developed in the Cimatron CAM system [36]. If the actual production
situation indicates that the highest priority equipment is not available, then alternative equipment
would be selected. Thus, the process is variable or resource independent. Similarly, equipment
options are installed for control and heat treatment operations.

It is important to reinforce here the fact that all product information related to the UTP
(material, operating modes, list of alternative equipment) is stored in cyber space at the second


level depicted in figure 1. The history of the workpiece in accordance with the WTP is also
accumulated in this level.

(b) Integrated multiscale modelling and simulation for the injection moulding process

In the development of the simulation model of the injection moulding process, the production
system is considered on three levels: technological operation level, manufacturing process level
and production process level [15].
