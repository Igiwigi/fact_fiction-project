consequently we may write 7=>x(1441—135Z+256), and then proceed to satisfy, by
assigning suitable values to >, p, », the identity
(1(14115—1352+2568)+62(81—92Y)* + w*E(81—9EY
=1(1'—1fE— 8 +3615 +162 — 275) =». 29G.
On performing the necessary calculations it will be found that

Hence we se that J*G may be expressed under the form (LL, +cJ;)*+eLJ;, where L,
is a new duodecimal invariant, and c, & are two known numbers; in fact
1G=(L(18JK+135I2—J'L)+(JK+9LY)+64L(IK+9LY.
I am indebted to my friend Dr. Hirsr for these references to the immortal work of
PLickER.
(94) The existence has been demonstrated of a linear asymptote which is a tangent

(7) I find, by a calculation which offers no difficulty, that the yalue of p at the point where this tangent cuts
the curve will be given by the equation
—2568'—256p"+ 2888+ 432p+135=0 ;
and taking away tho factor (46+3)" which belongs to the cusp, there remains p=4, which corresponds to a
Point in the lower branch of the superior horn.
