Fifthly, I will only observe with reference to Mr. Twomyson's general assertions,
that no great weight ought to be attached to them until the necessary details shall
have been given to the public, more especially if, as I have shown to be the case, we
find cause in those already published to distrust the views of the author.

Having thus gone through the various statements made by Mr. TaomesoN in 8up-
port of his theory, and ascertained from them the apparent want of confirmation of
such theory, I proceed to notice the opinions of crustaceologists whose writings have
established for them some degree of weight as authorities upon the question.

'These observations will be confined, firstly, to such as bear directly upon Mr. Trome-
80N's statements, and secondly, to such as relate to facts noticed respecting the trans-
formations in the early stages of various animals in the class; since it is the more
necessary in endeayouring to ascertain the correctness of the views of an author, to
reject all general assertions made by others to the contrary which have not been
made in reference to such opinion, or which do not rest upon direct observation.
And it is to be regretted that Mr. Taomeson's memoirs have been far from generally
known ; this will account for the slight degree of attention which has been bestowed
upon the interesting subject upon which they treat, and for the paucity of notices
respecting them.

We find LarrziLLE*, however, stating that the opinion of Mr. Twowesoxn © a grand
besoin d'Gtre 6tay6e par des experiences poxitives, si toutefois elle west pas erron6e.”
