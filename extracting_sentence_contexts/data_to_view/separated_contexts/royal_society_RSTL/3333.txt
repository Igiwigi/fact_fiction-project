In consideration that the results of the experiments on the roots of the nerves of
the spine, first made thirty years ago, have thus been confirmed by pathology, the
Society will perhaps permit me to state how I was induced to commence these experi-
ments. In thus adverting to my early investigations, I am only desirous of showing
the principle which guided me in these pursuits. Some of the physiologists, at home and abroad, who have treated of this subject,
have appeared to consider the facts brought out by the experiments on the spinal
nerves, as accidental results. Misconceiving the just application of experiments to
this inquiry, they have made it a hoast, that they proceeded to their experiments
without preparation ; and have gone 80 far as to represent the person who dissects
living animals, indifferent to the results, and only curious to find something new, as
the true philosopher! However this may be, my experiments on the spinal marrow
and roots of the nerves were not undertaken till after long consideration and much
minute dissection.
