of the pock, they gradually assume the characters of -horny scales, the nuclei of which
gradually disappear ; in this way the horny stratum (D in fig. 6) increases rapidly in
thickness towards the surface. The cells of the superficial layers of the deep
stratum of the rete Malpighii (viz. the layers directly beneath the horny stratum)
exhibit rows of highly refractive granules, which are seen to be the more deeply stained
by hzmatoxylin the further the cells containing them are from the corium, while the
cells themselyes are larger the nearer they are to the horny stratum. Many of those
nearest to the horny stratum look as if they possessed a thick membrane enclosing clear
contents, in which there are here and there a few granules besides the nucleus. These
cells are no doubt s8wollen dropsical epithelial cells.

The deepest stratum of the rete Malpighii is in a state of very active proliferation.
This is evinced by the fact that the interpapillary processes grow to extremely large
dimensions, and that cylindrical processes composed of young epithelial cells penetrate,
7. e. grow, into the papille of the corium from them, the papillee themselyes being
longer and thicker than natural. These epithelial processes penetrate into the papille
in different depths and in different directions ; s0 that in sections many of them present
themselvyes as isolated patches, surrounded by papillary substance, in the neighbourhood
of the Malpighian layer. These, as well as the processes which in the section are not
severed from their natural connexion with the rete Malpighii, are composed of the
same granular substance as the deepest layer of the rete Malpightii, and contain spherical
nuclei at more or less regular intervals, which exactly resemble those of the epithelial
cells of the rete Malpighii.

In most cases these processes show in section a distinct division into * territories,‚Äù
