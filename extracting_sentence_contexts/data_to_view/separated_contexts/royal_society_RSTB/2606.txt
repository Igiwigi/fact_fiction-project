Tt comes to be a question how far the recent Poritide are related with the recent
Madreporids. The external signs on which Epwarps and Hatmu chiefly founded
their group of M. perforata, including in it Eupsammids, Madreporids, and Poritids,
carry no longer any real weight. Porosity of the septum may be seen to a certain
extent in a few Astrids, most Fungids and Eupsammids, and in all Poritids,
whereas the septum of Madreporids is, as a matter of fact absolutely compact. Such
a feature only leads away from the fundamental laws of coral structure. A sure indication of relationship between the Poritide and the ccenenchymatous
group generally, is afforded hy the peripheral arrangement of the skeletal elements.
