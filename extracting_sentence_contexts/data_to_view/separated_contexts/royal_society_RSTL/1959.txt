R. 8. I determined to preſent to the Society
the following account of ſome thermometrical experi-
ments and obſervations, the greateſt part of which were
made as long ago as the year 1776. The courſe of thoſe
experiments having been often interrupted by mechani-
cal defects in the conſtruction of infiruments, and by
yarious other circumſtances, muſt not be conſidered as
complete inveſtigations of the propoſed views, but rather
as firſt attempts, which are to be proſecuted in caſe of
better opportunities, They contain a few facts, which
to me ſeem new and worthy of notice; and, perhaps,
the obſervations concerning the conſtruftion and uſe of
the inſtruments uſeful in experiments of this ſort, may
be of uſe to thoſe perſons who have the opportunity, and

are willing, to proſecute this experimental inquiry. Vol. LXX, 4H Having
