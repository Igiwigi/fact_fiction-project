Thus, by making ourselves acquainted with effects, we
shall be better qualified to investigate causes; and if those
effects shall appear to be beyond the powers of such natural
agents -as we are already acquainted with, we shall be justi-
fied in, admitting the performance of operations to which we
have seen nothing similar ; and also in admitting the former

existence 'of powers of far superior energy to any we have
ever known in action. Enumeration of some remarkable Inequalities in the Surface of
our basaltic Area, produced since the Consolidation of its
Strata. That we may better understand the facts T am proceeding
to state, I shall assume (in the style of the mathematicians
puta factum ) previous to demonstration, that the planes of our
uniform, rectilineal strata, however interrupted we may now
find them, were once continuous. Upon this supposition, the valley of the Mayola, between
the stratified summits of Seafin and Slievegallon, is an excava-
tion 1700 feet deep, and three miles wide, of which the whole
materials have been completely carried off. To the northward of this excavation, between Seafin"and
Carntogher, the continuous accumulated strata of basalt are
interrupted, and taken away quite down to the schistose sub-
stratum ; while the untouched summits of the contiguous
mountains, Carntogher, Seafin, and Monyneeny, are $till strati-
fied basalt.
