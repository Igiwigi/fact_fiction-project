Its solution as f > 00, which is called the
neutral solution, is given by

Xp =Ae’ug + Ae aig, (2.2)
where @ = wt and A is an arbitrary complex amplitude. Note that e'’ ug and its complex conjugate
are the eigenfunctions of the operator Lo - «(d/d6@) with zero eigenvalue. This fact will be used
later. As was stated in the introductory section, the basic idea of reduction is to reinterpret the
arbitrary parameter A appearing in the time-asymptotic solution as a dynamical variable and try
to absorb the effect of perturbation into the slow evolution of A. At the same time, the change of
the solution form from (2.2), however small it may be, is inevitable.
