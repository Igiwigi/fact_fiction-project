Indeed, there is considerable evidence to the contrary. The star y Cassiopeize{
has a spectrum of type B Op, with the Balmer lines Ha to H¢ bright (and, except
Ha, centrally reversed), and with a number of bright metallic lines, thus a spectrum
with distinctly chromospheric features. The suggestion is that the star is in fact
provided with a very extensive chromosphere. Scuuster§ showed that when there
is a continuous background bright lines can only be produced if there is sufficient
scattering to dim the background, combined with a low temperature gradient, otherwise
the lines should be absorption lines. The inference is that y Cassiopeise possesses an
extensive hydrogen atmosphere in which the general absorption is small compared
with the scattering and the selective emission.
