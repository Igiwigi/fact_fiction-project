I may add that, unless additional specimens are exposed by falls of the cliff, further
material of this kind can be obtained only by mining in the 6-inch coal supporting
the trees, and. its roof. In the following pages I propose to notice as shortly as is consistent with clearness,
the new facts obtained from the study of these interesting fossils, under the following
heads :â€”

1. Geological relations of the beds containing the fossiliferous trees,
2. Character and contents of the trees. 3. Description of the included animal remains.
