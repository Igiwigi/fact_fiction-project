THE STANDARDIZATION OF PHOTO-ELECTRIC CELLS 23

daylight figures are not in so good accord as with W 21104-2. This may very easily
be due to the fact that the curvature correction, as found for the latter, may not
be quite great enough for the former, and so in bright daylight may lead to the not
very important difference found. We have omitted from the Table III the standardizations of the cuprous oxide
cells in “ mean noon sunlight,” as we found the loss in sensitivity which they undergo
in daylight render them useless for anything but comparative values at one time. By comparison in daylight on February 26, 1932, we found a cell of this type, kindly
given to us by Dr. P. AuceEr, was highly sensitive and 32-metre candles on the
potassium carbon are scale gave 1:00 wa.
