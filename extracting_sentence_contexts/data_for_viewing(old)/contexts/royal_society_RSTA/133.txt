Anderson-Gill approach were comparable. Discrepancies between our method
and the Anderson-Gill approach are likely to be due to the discretization of time.
While VE estimated by our method is based on the ratio of cumulative hazards
over the specified time period, VE estimated by the Anderson-Gill method is
based on the ratio of instantaneous hazards over the time period. Overall, our
repeated measures model constituted a valid alternative to the Anderson-Gill

approach, and in fact would be a more appropriate method to analyse data in
which information about time to event is known in discrete time intervals
(interval censoring). Moreover, although our estimator was based on discrete
time to event, the half-widths of the 95% Wald CI of the estimator proposed here
and that from the Anderson-Gill method were very similar. The difference was
negligible in all simulation scenarios and at most 0.001.

4. Reanalysis of a malaria vaccine trial

We reanalyse the Brazilian trial of the SP£66 vaccine (Urdaneta et al. 1998) to
compare the VE estimated through proportional hazards analysis (of first even’
only) with the VE estimated through our repeated measures estimator (of firs
and second events) implemented with a GEE approach. The SPf66 vaccine was
