posed that no insurmountable barrier to HGT exists [12]. HGT
into metazoan genomes is striking, the more so because it
has disrupted long-held assumptions about the nature of inheri-
tance and evolution in complex organisms. However, while
metazoan HGT clearly occurs, the complexity of eukaryotic gen-
omes, and the ease by which samples can become contaminated
with bacterial DNA creating false positives, have thrown some
of the more extreme claims into doubt [13]. The consensus,
therefore, is that successful HGT into metazoan taxa is relatively
rare, albeit with potentially huge impact for phenotype and
fitness where it does occur [14].

By contrast, in the microbial world, HGT is a fact of life.
For bacteria in particular, HGT is a major mode of adapta-
tion, making a significant contribution to genome evolution
and structure [1,15,16]. Bacterial HGT has a central role in
adaptation to environmental challenges, like colonization of
new environments, exploitation of novel carbon sources and
resistance to toxins [17]. The increasing evidence placing
humans in the midst of an essentially microbial world [18-
20], where bacteria have fundamental roles in biogeochemical
cycles, health and disease, and food security, makes it all the
more important to understand their evolution and ecology.
Furthermore, bacteria are increasingly used as model systems
for understanding general evolutionary processes [21]. In this
