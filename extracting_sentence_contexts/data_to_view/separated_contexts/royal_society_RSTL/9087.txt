The expansion in harmonic series would seem, however, to be
practically more useful in determining the mutual forces between two electrical circuits,

Throughout the following investigations, the method of treating Spherical Harmonics
introduced by TromsoN and TAIT will be almost exclusively adopted.

$2. Taking a point A on the axis of 2 produced negatively at a distance « from the
origin, let us consider the result of integrating

the reciprocal of 7. If we denote by the suffix 1 the fact of the operator being upon 2", and by the
suthx 2 of its being upon u, then the operator

Referring now to the general result (3), and picking out the general term, we find

In order that this may lead to a value not zero, we must have

Substituting then this value of 7, and differentiating 2", putting a, y, 2=0 after
the differentiations, we get
