The varying relative dimensions of the anterior aud posterior chambers of the air-
bladder in different Silurides very probably bear sore relation tu corresponding varia-
tions in the delicacy of the Weberian mechanism as a pressuve register in varions
species, for, as ia the case with the analogous parts of the thermometer, the suacepti-
bility of the mechanism should, within certain limits, increase as the posterior eliataboers
bevome larger and the anterior chamber smaller.

284 PROFESSORS T. W, BRIDGE AND A. 0. HADDON The conelusion to which these facts seem irresistibly to point is still further
strangthened hy the condition of the air-bladder and Weberian mechanism in the
Siluride abnormales, lat as we shall subsequently have occasion to refer to these
Siluroids at some length, we need now only say that iu « large number of cases the ;
degenerate and rudimentary contlition of these structures is associated with the ;
purely “ground” habit of these Fishes. It is well known that the assumption of a —
ground habit, is in many Fishes accompanied by the degeneration, or even total dis-
appearance, of the air-bleadder, which, under such conditions, becomes useless as. a
hydrostatic organ, even if its retention is not distinctly harmful to the species, and
hence its liability to degenerate to the condition of a more or less rudimentary
structure, or become completely suppressed, The correlation of a similar habit of
life with deyeneration of the air-bladder and Weberiau mechanism in the partieular _
ease of the Silavidw abnovmales, seems to us to furnish almost conclusive evidence
that both organs are solely related to the normal hydrostatic function.
