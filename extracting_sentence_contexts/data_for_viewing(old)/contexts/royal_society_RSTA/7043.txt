the curves for which have been given in figure 12. Some of these refer to real insulators
and some to bad conductors, but there is no distinction to be seen in the bands. We
shall therefore treat all as though referring to insulators, that is, substances with filled
Brillouin zones.

The complexity of the curves arises from the fact that, since all the substances dealt
with have three or more electrons per atom, the filled Brillouin zone has always sets
of planes in k-space within it. These give rise to sets of peaks and kinks; a very good
example of the former is seen at 10 eV in the case of diamond, which, with Si, has
the simplest lattice structure of all. In this paper, however, we shall ignore such
complexity, and deal only with the general features.

The most characteristic properties of the bands for non-metals, namely, ‘false edges’
and ‘band-ends’, have already been mentioned in § 6. They occur indiscriminately
in K-and L,-spectra. We shall now try to interpret these features with the aid of a simple
model. Suppose that the Brillouin zone holding all the valence electrons is a simple
cube. As & increases in the centre of the cube, as long as the contours of constant
energy remain approximate spheres, we obtain the relations
