That the discrepancies between reconstruction and phantom are so small emphasizes
the challenge for the large-scale optimization algorithms; for actual application where images are
presented for visual inspection, such accurate solution to equation (1.1) would not be necessary. The results for the texture phantom are also quite interesting in that we see the reconstructed
image is visually accurate for as few views as Ny = 80. That there is no sharp recovery transition
for the texture phantom is probably due to the fact that the object variations occur on two scales:
the jumps of the structure borders, and the splotches of the walnut meat texture. It also cannot be
ruled out that a sharper recovery transition will occur if the accuracy of the computed solutions
is improved even further.

(e) Conclusion on Study C

In this study, we have taken first steps towards phase-diagram analysis for prediction of critical
sampling levels for realistic CT systems. Both test phantom design and accurate large-scale
optimization are more difficult than for small-scale studies, and we have demonstrated how
phantom appearance as well as parameters and convergence of the algorithm can affect recovery
studies.
