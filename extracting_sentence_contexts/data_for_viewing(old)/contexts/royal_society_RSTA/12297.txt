The wind therefore causes a positive or negative change of phase in every directi
except that whose cosine is 4 v/V, the same direction as that already (§ 13) indica’
as possessing a zero Doppler effect.

But the observation of the lag of phase thus caused by motion of the entire ethe
medium is not so easy as might appear, and, in fact, it has not yet been detected ; fo
the simple reason that it is liable to affect both the interfering rays equally : as we no
show.

Devices for Observing the Lag of Phase.

16. The possible ways in which change of phase, produced by a moving mediw
may be looked for, are :—to split a beam of light into two halves, and then—

(1) Make the medium flow with one half beam and against the other.

This is successful, and is the Fizuav experiment ; but it entails control over t
medium, and artificial motion of it; the terrestrial orbital motion cannot be utili
