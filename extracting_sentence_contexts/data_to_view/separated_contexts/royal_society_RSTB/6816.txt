Nothing further of importance has been traced on the subject: the few
additional papers of minor interest are those of Schmotzer and Zimmerman (1922) and
Grimpe (1923). The subject of reproduction in the spotted hyaena thus appeared to be one into
which investigation was desirable. Little or no material was available in Europe, and
correspondence with the Game Departments of Kenya and Tanganyika revealed the
fact that, though the spotted hyaena is one of the commonest animals in many parts of
Africa, nothing was known of its breeding, beyond the popular accounts of herma-
phroditism referred to above. In the autumn of 1935, therefore, the author travelled to
East Africa to study the animal.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The most promising way of investigating the problem in hand appeared to be to
examine as large a series of spotted hyaenas as possible. The writer therefore chartered
a 30-cwt.
