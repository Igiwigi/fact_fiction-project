Neptune’s observable atmosphere is primarily hydrogen and helium [61,62]. The He/Hp ratio i>
was found to be 0.15+0.03 by volume for a nominal nitrogen abundance of 0.003 using a :<
combination of Voyager 2 radio occultation and InfraRed Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS) : >
observations [63]. This is close to the protosolar He/Hp ratio of 0.17 [64] and may suggest H ia
and He gas were captured directly from the solar nebula. However, Conrath et al. [63] show : S
that nitrogen abundances from 0 to 0.006 can also provide reasonable fits to the Voyager IRIS : S
spectra, resulting in possible He/H) ratios of 0.08-0.22 by volume and leaving open the possibility :8

that Neptune could have sub-solar or super-solar He/H2. Nevertheless, the fact that Neptune’s
atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium implies Neptune had to reach
sufficient size for direct gravitational accretion fairly rapidly, because the lifetime of the protosolar
nebula is estimated at less than or equal to 10 Myr [26,65]. Therefore, the hydrogen and helium
abundance do not discriminate between ice and rock giant interior structures, but are important
when considering hydrogen sources for interpretation of the D/H and O/H observations.

On Neptune methane does not condense until approximately 1-2bar, meaning that the
abundance at higher pressures can be considered representative of Neptune’s interior, assuming
the interior is fully mixed. Neptune’s tropospheric methane varies significantly with latitude,
but has a globally averaged volume mixing ratio of approximately 2-5% for pressures deeper
