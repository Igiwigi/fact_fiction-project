the identification of orcein purple. Absorption (—logR) together with fluorescence emission and
excitation spectra correlate well with the data obtained for the orcein-dyed silk reference (Lasallia
pustulata). In fact, purple paints are characterized by absorption maxima between 575 and 578 nm
with a shoulder at 540-545nm, similar to the dyed silk reference, with absorption maxima at
580 nm and a shoulder at 540nm (figure 5 and table 5). In turn, the purple paints absorption
matches well the excitation spectrum, which is well resolved, as depicted in figure 6. On the
other hand, the emission spectrum is characterized by a broad band with maxima between 590
and 600nm, which compares well with the 602nm value for the dyed silk reference (table 5).
