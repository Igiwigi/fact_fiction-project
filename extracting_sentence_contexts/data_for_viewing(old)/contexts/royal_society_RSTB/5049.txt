destined to become the base of a tetraradiate spine. Probably in the simplest, most
primitive condition each of these processes gave rise to a single prong, the result being a
triradiate spine. Triradiates are quite common in Â£, miliaris. As has already been
described (see p. 272), one of these processes soon divides, each branch forming a prong.
This tetraradiate symmetry is indeed curious and quite unique. Elsewhere the symmetry
is either tri- or hexaradiate. How, then, has this unusual symmetry arisen? The
occurrence of an occasional spine with six prongs suggests that, at some period in the
history of these primitive triradiate spines, each of the three vertical processes divided
into two to give a hexaradiate form. The tetraradiate spine may have been derived
from such a hexaradiate by the elimination (secondarily) of division in the case of two
of the projections.

The fact that the primordia of these spines appear in advance of those of the typical
spines (see p. 264) lends weight to the view that they are ancestral forms precociously
developed. On the other hand, they may be larval modifications.

These tetraradiate spines bear a somewhat superficial resemblance to the spines of an
Asteroid, especially as regards the absence of a definite tubercle on the plates to which
they are atached. But the development of the spines of Asterina gibbosa, Lupwic
(1882), is in close agreement with that of the typical Echinoid spine for, although
apparently commencing as a small triradiate, the base becomes hexaradiate and a single
vertical process arises from the centre of the base.

The development of the spheeridium shows conclusively that it is really a reduced and
modified spine. The foundation of the globular portion consists of six (in some cases
