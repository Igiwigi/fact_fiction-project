We may instance the development by PEaRson of a very
extensive system of skew curves, the elaboration of a method of calculating their para-
meters, and the preparation of the necessary tables, a body of work which has enormously
extended the power of modern statistical practice, and which has been, by pertinacity
and inspiration alike, practically the work of a single man. Nor is the introduction of
the Pearsonian system of frequency curves the only contribution which their author has
made to the solution of problems of specification: of even greater importance is the
introduction of an objective criterion of goodness of fit. For empirical as the specifica-
tion of the hypothetical population may be, this empiricism is cleared of its dangers if
we can apply a rigorous and objective test of the adequacy with which the proposed
population represents the whole of the available facts. Once a statistic, suitable for
applying such a test, has been chosen, the exact form of its distribution in random
samples must be investigated, in order that we may evaluate the probability that a
worse fit should be obtained from a random sample of a population of the type con-
sidered. The possibility of developing complete and self-contained tests of goodness of
fit deserves very careful consideration, since therein lies our justification for the free
use which is made of empirical frequency formule.
