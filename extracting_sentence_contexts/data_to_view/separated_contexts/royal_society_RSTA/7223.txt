UMERICAL VALUES OF THE GENERAL RATE

The formula /,(4) (58) for K/K,, depends solely on 1, the number of modes, and @. As by
(60) 7 is proportional to the collision frequency , and so to the pressure / at constant tem-
perature 7, the theory in the present approximation predicts a single characteristic curve
of log,, A/K., against logy) / foreachn; the sole effect of changing to a different temperature,
A table

of 1,(0) thus gives the shape of the curves for all cases where the present approximations are

n\

or toa different gas with the same 7, is to translate the curve parallel to the log, / axis

reliable; but the absolute position of the curve on the pressure scale requires an estimation
of the ratio @/p for the gas and temperature under consideration. (The calculation of a
K/K,, table is not made superfluous by the previous comparison with Kassel’s theory; for
Kassel used his exact quantal or classical formulae, and calculated K/X,, afresh for the
characteristics s, A, Ey, T of each reaction he treated.)

A table of 7,(/) is given in (b) below, preceded in (a) by general estimates of @// for
various 7. It would be misleading to give the table first, since the increase of /,(7) with n
might suggest that A/K,, increases with n for fixed /; in fact, it tends to decrease owing to
changes in the //f ratio. This point is made clear in (c) below, by giving the ‘transition
pressures’ for specified values of K/K,,. In (d) a note is added on temperature effects.
