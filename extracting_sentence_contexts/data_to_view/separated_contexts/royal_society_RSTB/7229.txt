Since dominators were not
found to be present in the eyes of rats or guinea-pigs, which are stated to be devoid of cones,
he concluded that cones are essential elements for the existence of dominators. When, later,
he investigated the retinae of cats, these ideas were confirmed ; he found, moreover, in these
animals that the photopic dominators gave a response with a hump at about 6000A, very
alike in shape to that found by Wright when a small foveal patch, of 20 min. of arc, is
investigated in the human eye. Granit found several other facts concerning dominators. First, that by selected adapta-
tion a dominator can apparently be split into the individual modulators which compose
it. Further, that it was possible to synthesize the human photopic luminosity curve, on the
basis of three fundamental sensation curves: blue, green and red, the latter being made up
of two modulators, MY and MR.
