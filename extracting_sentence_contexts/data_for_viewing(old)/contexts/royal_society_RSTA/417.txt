ECHAM6-FESOM turns out to be very different. The mean sea ice volume in the Arctic and
Antarctic remains largely unchanged with the stochastic scheme switched on. In the Arctic, this
can be explained by the fact that in an integrated sense the increase of sea ice thickness north of
Greenland and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago is accompanied by a loss of sea ice in the central
and eastern Arctic. This reflects the increased transport of sea ice from the eastern to the western
Arctic which is also reflected in increased sea ice velocities. The same argument holds for the


Antarctic. However, in the Southern Hemisphere, sea ice shows evidence of being increasingly
transported eastward and changes in thicknesses are smaller than in the north.

The fact that the coupled system responds differently to a stochastic sea ice parametrization
compared with an uncoupled model highlights the fact that care has to be taken when results from
uncoupled experiments are extrapolated to the coupled climate system. The results suggest that
by incorporating the atmosphere a negative feedback is introduced that prevents the stochastic
effect in the coupled model from accumulating. Given the slowness of the accumulation process
in the uncoupled model (figure 1), it is likely that even a relatively weak negative atmospheric
feedback would be sufficient to prevent the stochastic sea ice parametrization from influencing
the mean climate of the coupled system. Given the strong variability of sea ice on a wide range of
timescales, therefore, pinning down the exact negative mechanisms is challenging.

However, one reason for the discrepancies between the coupled and the uncoupled simulation
might have to do with the atmospheric response (or lack thereof) to an increased amount of : =
open water during the freezing season owing to the stochastic sea ice parametrization. In the 3
uncoupled stochastic simulation, the fluxes are fixed, and therefore the atmosphere is prevented
