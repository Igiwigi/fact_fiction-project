Aurnoven the invention of plausible hypotheses, independent
of any connection with experimental observations, can be of
very little use in the promotion of natural knowledge; yet the
discovery of simple and uniform principles, by which a great
number of apparently heterogeneous phenomena are reduced
to coherent and universal laws, must ever be allowed to be of
considerable importance towards the improvement of the human
intellect. The object of the present dissertation is not s0 much to pro-
pose any opinions which are absolutely new, as to refer s0me
theories, which have been already advanced, to their original
inventors, to support them by additional evidence, and to apply
them to a great number of diversified facts, which have hitherto
been buried in obscurity. Nor is it absolutely necessary in this
instance to produce a single new experiment; for of experi-
ments there is already an ample store, which are 80 much the
more unexceptionable, as they must have been conducted with-
out the least partiality for the system by which they will be
explained; yet some facts, hitherto unobserved, will be brought
forwards, in order to show the perfect agreement of that system
with the multifarious phenomena of nature. Dr. YouNe's Lecture, &c. 15

The optical observations of NewrTon are yet unrivalled ; and,
excepting some casual inaccuracies, they only rise in our esti-
mation, as we compare them with later attempts to improve
on them. A further consideration of the colours of thin plates,
as they are described in the second book of Newron's optics,
has converted that prepossession which I before entertained for
the undulatory system of light, into a very strong conviction of
its truth and sufficiency; a conviction which has been since most
strikingly confirmed, by an analysis of the colours of striated
substances.
