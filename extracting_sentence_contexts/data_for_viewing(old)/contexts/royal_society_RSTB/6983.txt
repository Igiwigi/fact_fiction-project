Food collection is probably further facilitated by the asymmetry of the mandibles.
Among Crustacea it has been shown (Cannon & Manton 1927) that this plays a large part
in food transference, and in Calandra also it is probable that food is passed in a zigzag
manner between the teeth of right and left mandibles until it reaches the molar teeth,
Furthermore, the asymmetry of the mandibles has the obvious result of allowing the
mandibles to come completely together on apposition.

The movements and functions of the right mandible are similar to those of the left,
with the exception that here the subapical tooth is the prominent cutting tooth.

It is difficult to obtain by direct observation any information on the actual cutting of
the grain by the individual mandibular teeth, but as far as I can deduce from their action,
it is due to the fact that, although they are curved inwards and slightly upwards, their
curves do not coincide with those of their arcs of movement. The curved long axis of each
tooth slopes a little more anteriorly and dorsally than does its arc of rotation, so that the
tooth performs a scythe-like sweep, its sharp ventral margin passing at an obtuse angle
over the surface of the grain. It therefore cuts in a manner like that of the blade of a plane,
but as a result of the friable nature of the food continuous shavings are not produced.

It has been stated that the molar teeth of the mandibles work mainly in an antero-
posterior direction, and the pharyngeal bracons, therefore, attached close behind these
teeth, are necessarily caused to move to and fro in the pharynx.

In general, therefore, it may be said of the mandibles of Calandra that the angle of
inclination of their axes of rotation is such as to impart to each tooth movement in a direc-
