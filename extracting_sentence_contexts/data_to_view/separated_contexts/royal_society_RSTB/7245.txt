It is possible that as many as seven
or eight different kinds of receptors are to be found in the human fovea. If this is confirmed,
two questions will require an answer: (1) Is it not very unlikely that clusters will occur
when there are present sense organs of so many different kinds? and (2) If, in fact, there
are all these different kinds of cluster, will not the mottling which they produce be very
troublesome when, for example, a uniform white surface is looked at? The reply to the first question appears to be as follows: a cluster does not necessarily
consist of receptors of only one kind. Thus, if red rays are being perceived, the clusters may
consist of all those varieties of receptor which can respond to red rays.
