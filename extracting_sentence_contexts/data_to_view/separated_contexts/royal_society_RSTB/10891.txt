In theory, somatic mutations can be transmitted
to the next generation as germlines. However, in Arabidopsis, germline cell divisions are independent of both plant age and
vegetative age [63], meaning older plants do not pass along longer or shorter telomeres. Tracing telomeres through successive
generations, [63] found that the shortest telomeres were typically elongated in the subsequent generation, while the longest
telomeres were usually shortened.
