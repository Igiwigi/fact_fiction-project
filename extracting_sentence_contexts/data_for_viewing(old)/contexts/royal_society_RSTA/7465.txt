as comparison of amplitudes that the theory is least likely to be adequate.

When 27°kT/fH is sufficiently small, formula (5) differs appreciably from (1) not only
in predicting modified amplitudes, but also in predicting the presence of harmonic com-
ponents. As can be seen from (5) the predicted ratio r, of the amplitude of the pth harmonic
to that of the fundamental is given by

if the Landau formula is modified to take account of electron spin (see p. 4) and collision
broadening. Detailed measurement of a single cycle for ~ = 78-9° in the ab-plane at 1-08° K
did in fact suggest the presence of harmonics, but since the envelope curve showed beats in
this region (figure 1) and the finite twist of the crystal could have also contributed a second
harmonic of strength comparable to that observed, it was decided to repeat the measure-
ments under more favourable conditions before making any analysis. The repetition was
made with Ga 5, using a stiffer suspension and at y = 84-3° in the ab-plane, where the beats
were much less pronounced; under these conditions the instrumental effect could be shown
to be very small. Measurements were made at several temperatures and some of the curves
are shown in figure 6 and summarized in table 3, in which the values of 7,, r, and 7, found by
Fourier analysis of the experimental curves are compared with the values predicted by (7) ;
the relative phases of the harmonic components will be considered later (see p. 21). The
