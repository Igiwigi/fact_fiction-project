THE NORTH SEA AND ENGLISH CHANNEL. 715

but, on the contrary, a large tract of still water which the streams scarcely ever
disturb, but this arises from the different conformation of the inner part of the
strait. The Irish Sea, for instance, may be said to be contracted at its entrances, and
to expand into a large inland sea in its centre, whereas the other channel has wide Tidal pheno-
entrances and a very contracted centre. They are, however, both canals in which ON,

There cannot therefore be any doubt that the waves which are formed in the
centre of these straits exert a powerful influence over the course of the waters on
both sides of them, and in fact that they both govern their movements and regulate
the limits of their streams.
It was the consideration of this influence that determined me to refer all the
movements of the streams of these Channels to the time when the combined wave
was matured. In the Irish Sea I adopted Liverpool as the standard*, and as Dover
was s8ituated s0 near to the apex of the wave in the English Channel, and had tables
of its tides already printed and in general circulation, I adopted the time of high
water at that place as a standard to which all the observations there should be re-
ferred.
I shall now compare the general inclination or slope of the surfaces of the com- Comparison
