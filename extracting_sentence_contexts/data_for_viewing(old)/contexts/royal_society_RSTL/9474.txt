There was a slight leak or probably slight diffuson through the india-rubber, for after
the experiments were concluded the apparatus was left full of hydrogen at the pressure
of the atmosphere, and the tap communicating with the pump closed. It was then
found that the pressure within the chambers steadily fell until it reached 9 inches
of mercury. This point was reached after about one month. The pressure then began
to rise, and in another month the gauge showed 12 inches. The entire volume of the
chambers and tubes is only about 6 fluid ounces, 80 that it might well be imagined
that the hydrogen had been absorbed by, or condensed on the india-rubber or the
porous plate, bub the fact that the pressure again rose seemed to imply that the
hydrogen had escaped ; but whether through the india-rubber or not it is impossible
to 8ay.

Such a leak, however, was entirely without effect on the results. In fact, a leak
which admitted air at the rate of 1 inch of mercury in an hour into one chamber did
not cause any appreciable alteration in the differential guage.

Drying the gas.

17. The presence of vapour in the gas was at first a gource of great trouble. The
tendeney of porous plates to absorb moisture is 80 great, and the presence of vapour in
the gas produces such a great disturbance even when the pressure of yapour is a long
way below that at which it would condense on the cold surface, that for some time
