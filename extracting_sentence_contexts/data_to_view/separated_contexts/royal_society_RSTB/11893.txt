Unlike other endocytic pathways, macropinocytosis is acutely tion, it reciprocally influences cell signalling. Amino acids
induced by growth factors (figure 3) [3,4]. In fact, membrane either imported through plasma membrane transporters or
ruffling and macropinosome formation are among the earliest ingested with extracellular fluid through macropinocytosis
cellular responses to growth factor stimuli [15,16]. The signal can activate mTORC1 [30]. While nutrient transporters flux
transduction cascade that initiates macropinosome formation amino acids into the cytosol at high rates, macropinocytic
is centred around the small GTPase Ras and Class I phospha- uptake of extracellular fluid conceivably contributes to intra-
tidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase).
