(ie. two centuries). Additionally, tracking Neanderthal alleles
in contemporary human individuals [99,101,102] revealed a
significantly higher Neanderthal ancestry within contempo-
rary Asians than contemporary Europeans [99,102]. This
difference is not compatible with a single admixture pulse
from Neanderthals within the ancestral population of modern
Europeans and Asians, but requires instead a second pulse
within the Asian lineage after it diverged from modern
Europeans [99,103,104], i.e. within the past 38 000 years [47].

(b) Admixture with Denisovans

As a matter of fact, current population models suggest
admixture events with more archaic hominins than just
the Neanderthals. One such group has been nicknamed the
Denisovans, after the analysis of the genome sequence from
an Upper Paleolithic finger bone excavated at the Denisova
cave (in the Siberian Altai) revealed that another group of
archaic hominins than Neanderthals existed in Eurasia some
ca 50 000-110 000 years ago [62-64]. Denisovans are known
by only one genome sequence, and genome-wide information
from two additional specimens [63,105]. The Denisovansâ€™
mtDNA is very divergent, and tracks a lineage that split from
a population ancestral to both Neanderthals and AMHs
approximately 1.0Ma [105,106]. Their nuclear genome,
