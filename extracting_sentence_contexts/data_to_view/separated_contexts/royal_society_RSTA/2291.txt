Two experiments A and B are statistically independent if the occurrence of any
of the events of A (8) does not affect the probability of occurrence of any of the events of B
(respectively, A). Consequently, if A and B are statistically independent experiments and matrix p(S_) is the
behaviour for A (e.g. p(S_4) could be the one in equation (2.4)) and q(Sx) is the behaviour for
B, then an observer can define an experiment (A, B) with a behaviour given by p(S_4) ® q(Sp),
where @ is the tensor product.

b) Result

The aim of this paper is to prove the following:

Theorem 3.4. The set of behaviours P(S) allowed by quantum theory for any Bell or KS scenario S is
equal to the largest set allowed by assumptions 3.1 and 3.2.

c) The totalitarian principle

The fact that the quantum set equals the largest set allowed by assumptions 3.1 and 3.2 implies
that any behaviour allowed by these assumptions is compulsory in the sense that there exist a
preparation and a set of measurements that produce it. This resembles Gell-Mann’s totalitarian
principle [4]: ‘anything not forbidden is compulsory’. The story of the totalitarian principle can be summarized as follows.
