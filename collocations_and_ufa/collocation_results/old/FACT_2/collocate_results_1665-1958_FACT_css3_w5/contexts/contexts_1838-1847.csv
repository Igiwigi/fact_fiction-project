as in the Polydesmide. This fact is especially interesting in reference,this,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
to the legs (4). This fact is interesting from the circumstance,this,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
is slightly affected. This latter fact is indicated by the loss,this,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11

"few words, in what this fact consists, together with the principal",this,rstl_1845_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1845,11

circumstance readily understood in the fact that successive series of filaments,in,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11

The singular nature of this fact will account for its introduction,the,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11
"is extremely faint, but the fact is worthy of notice, as",the,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11

ascertained. There is already one fact which was obtained with the,the,rstl_1840_0010.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11
this is supported by the fact of several portions being discovered,the,rstl_1840_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11

"in it. The next remarkable fact is, that in each division",the,rstl_1840_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11

previously recorded a somewhat similar fact in relation to the action,the,rstl_1843_0003.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11

circumstance readily understood in the fact that successive series of filaments,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
as in the Polydesmide. This fact is especially interesting in reference,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
to the legs (4). This fact is interesting from the circumstance,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
But it differs in the fact that the optic ganglia (c),the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11

"closely, I perceived that the fact I have just mentioned was",the,rstl_1847_0004.txt,txt_rstl,1847,11

not a little remarkable. In fact the southern stars would seem,the,rstl_1847_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1847,11

"is extremely faint, but the fact is worthy of notice, as",the,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11

obtained further evidence of the fact from an apparatus which I,the,rstl_1840_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11
It is a well known fact that the voltaic current will,the,rstl_1840_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11

ascertained. There is already one fact which was obtained with the,the,rstl_1840_0010.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11
this is supported by the fact of several portions being discovered,the,rstl_1840_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11
"to be decidedly cylindrical. The fact seems to be, that in",the,rstl_1840_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11

"in it. The next remarkable fact is, that in each division",the,rstl_1840_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11

"of using it, and in fact using the paper actually wet",the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11

to belieye it from the fact of some slight inequalities in,the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11
"the entire length of any,—a fact tending to the same conclusion.",the,rstl_1841_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1841,11

the know- ledge of this fact forms a necessary introduction to,the,rstl_1841_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1841,11

of the animal. This latter fact shows that it is not,the,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,11

previously recorded a somewhat similar fact in relation to the action,the,rstl_1843_0003.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
is the still more striking fact that alkalized water (2092.) having,the,rstl_1843_0004.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
circumstance readily understood in the fact that successive series of filaments,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
as in the Polydesmide. This fact is especially interesting in reference,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
to the legs (4). This fact is interesting from the circumstance,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
But it differs in the fact that the optic ganglia (c),the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11

In no instance has the fact been better exem- plified in,the,rstl_1844_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1844,11

The most im- portant additional fact which we derive from the,the,rstl_1844_0006.txt,txt_rstl,1844,11

the know- ledge of this fact forms a necessary introduction to,this,rstl_1841_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1841,11
of its chief characteristics. This fact was first noticed long ago,this,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,11

to the legs (4). This fact is interesting from the circumstance,this,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11

The singular nature of this fact will account for its introduction,this,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11

the know- ledge of this fact forms a necessary introduction to,this,rstl_1841_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1841,11
of its chief characteristics. This fact was first noticed long ago,this,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,11

"more re- markable, from the fact that this outlet is in",this,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,11

as in the Polydesmide. This fact is especially interesting in reference,this,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
to the legs (4). This fact is interesting from the circumstance,this,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
is slightly affected. This latter fact is indicated by the loss,this,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
"This is shown from the fact that, in these parts, the",this,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11

"few words, in what this fact consists, together with the principal",this,rstl_1845_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1845,11

The singular nature of this fact will account for its introduction,the,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11

ascertained. There is already one fact which was obtained with the,the,rstl_1840_0010.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11
this is supported by the fact of several portions being discovered,the,rstl_1840_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11

previously recorded a somewhat similar fact in relation to the action,the,rstl_1843_0003.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
is the still more striking fact that alkalized water (2092.) having,the,rstl_1843_0004.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
circumstance readily understood in the fact that successive series of filaments,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11

to the legs (4). This fact is interesting from the circumstance,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
But it differs in the fact that the optic ganglia (c),the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11

The most im- portant additional fact which we derive from the,the,rstl_1844_0006.txt,txt_rstl,1844,11

myself quite certain of this fact by means of the galya-,the,rstl_1847_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1847,11

not a little remarkable. In fact the southern stars would seem,the,rstl_1847_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1847,11

"is extremely faint, but the fact is worthy of notice, as",the,rstl_1840_0017.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11
entire. But let not this fact militate against our conelusions. The,the,rstl_1840_0014.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11
"respiration continued, I established the fact that there was a source",the,rstl_1840_0014.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11

ascertained. There is already one fact which was obtained with the,the,rstl_1840_0010.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11
this is supported by the fact of several portions being discovered,the,rstl_1840_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11
"to be decidedly cylindrical. The fact seems to be, that in",the,rstl_1840_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11

"in it. The next remarkable fact is, that in each division",the,rstl_1840_0022.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11

"of using it, and in fact using the paper actually wet",the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11
hitherto hesitated to announce. The fact to which I allude is,the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11
to belieye it from the fact of some slight inequalities in,the,rstl_1840_0002.txt,txt_rstl,1840,11
"the entire length of any,—a fact tending to the same conclusion.",the,rstl_1841_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1841,11

the know- ledge of this fact forms a necessary introduction to,the,rstl_1841_0015.txt,txt_rstl,1841,11

"comparative anatomist, from the remarkable fact that it takes place in",the,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,11

of the animal. This latter fact shows that it is not,the,rstl_1841_0012.txt,txt_rstl,1841,11

previously recorded a somewhat similar fact in relation to the action,the,rstl_1843_0003.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
is the still more striking fact that alkalized water (2092.) having,the,rstl_1843_0004.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
circumstance readily understood in the fact that successive series of filaments,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
as in the Polydesmide. This fact is especially interesting in reference,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
to the legs (4). This fact is interesting from the circumstance,the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11
But it differs in the fact that the optic ganglia (c),the,rstl_1843_0013.txt,txt_rstl,1843,11

In no instance has the fact been better exem- plified in,the,rstl_1844_0009.txt,txt_rstl,1844,11

The most im- portant additional fact which we derive from the,the,rstl_1844_0006.txt,txt_rstl,1844,11
