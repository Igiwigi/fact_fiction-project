My specimens were probably less pure than that analysed by FaRapar.

I am anxious to call attention to the fact that the atomic constitution of caoutchouc
appears to bear some simple relation to the hydrocarbons resulting from its decompo-
sition by heat. The composition of caoutchouc coincides with that of isoprene and
caoutchine, as found by analysis, to a degree which is remarkable when we consider that
caoutchoue, in addition to being non-crystalline, is scarcely capable of purification by
chemical means. Additional evidence may be found in the 8mallness of the residue
which is left on submitting caoutchoue to heat. 'The following results of the analyses
will show the amount of confidence which may be placed in this idea.
