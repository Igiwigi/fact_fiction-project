The essential feature is a prominent columella; a second feature
which may be regarded as correlated, is the scanty development or absence of basal
structures. Lindstrdmia, the oldest of the genera (Ordov. to Carb.), has well-developed
septa reaching to the columella ; the septa are smooth on their surfaces and at their
edges; they have “ pinnate ” arrangement with regard to four principal septa, and a
slight fossula is present. The chief fact which at present calls our attention is
that “ stereoplasm ” fills the lower part of the visceral chamber, while in the upper
part dissepiments or tabulve are scantily developed (cf: Nictonson, ‘ Manual,’ loc. cit.,
p- 298). Fruce says the endothecal deposit is sometimes entirely stereoplasmic,
(‘ Trias. Korallen Paleont.,’ loc. ett., p. 81.) In certain recent Oculinids in Seriatopora,
and in a few Turbinolids (all of which I hold to be related to the ancient Zaphren-
tide), the basal structures are at times individual laminew, 7.¢., tabule or thin
dissepiments, and in the same coral may take the form of solid deposit, so-called
“ stereoplasm.” We need not then place much importance on the difference in the
basal structures of Lindstrdmia, and of the genus of the Cyathaxonide next to it in
age—Cyathamonia.
