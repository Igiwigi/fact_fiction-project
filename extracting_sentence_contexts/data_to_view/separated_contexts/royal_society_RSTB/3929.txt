An examination of text-figs. 1-9 will make this
plain. These figures will show, however, how exceedingly difficult it is to draw
definite conclusions from the skeletons of the hybrids, owing to the fact that in any
particular cross the individuals vary so widely among themselves. We give a series of drawings of the aboral ends of the body-rods in F. esculentus,
E. acutus, and E. miliaris, and all the hybrid crosses between these species, about
40 examples being shown of each (text-figs. 1-9).
