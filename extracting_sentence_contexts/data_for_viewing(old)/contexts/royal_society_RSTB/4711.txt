thirty-nine on the left. The front ten or twelve teeth, and the hindermost ten or
twelve, are more closely set than those in the middle of the series. The lower front
teeth lie obliquely, pointing more forward than upward; they are longer, finer and
more sharply pointed than the front teeth of the upper jaw. In the lower jaw of
Skull Z there are thirty-four teeth on the right side and thirty-seven on the left; they
are larger and longer than the teeth of the upper jaw, and they have sharp, hooked
points, resembling the spines of the bramble. The total number of teeth found in
Skull X is 144, in Skull Y 149, and in Skull Z 149, but Escurrcur (10, p. 90) puts
the total number of teeth in Megaptera foetuses at 186.

The hyoid bar is of the same shape in Skulls Y and Z as in Skull X, although the
transverse axis tends to become straighter as development proceeds ; the increase in
size may be gauged from the fact that fig. 16, A, representing the hyoid of Skull Z,
is of the natural size, whereas fig. 1, D, of the hyoid of Skull X, is enlarged (x 1Â°8).
There is no sign of bone in the hyoidsof X and Y; but in Skull Z, the
thyrohyals have begun to ossify, the bony part being about 11 mm. in length;
there is as yet no sign of a basihyal. In the adult the three bones fuse into one, and
the delimiting sutures disappear; a figure of the hyoid of an adult Megaptera is
