The Bracts.

erse sections passing through the base of the disc, or coherent whorl of
find the out-going bundles again, just where they leave the cortex, and
slic uely into the verticil (see Plate 85, fig. 55, which is from the same
e more general figure in W1LLIAMson, Part XVIII., Plate 27, fig. 9).

sint each bundle undergoes a division into three. One branch, the most
the trio, continues its course through the disc; the two others are given
inner side, towards the axis, and supply two sporangiophores (compare
d 56, on Plate 85). The external branch in each case runs straight out
e dise into one of the free bracts, each of which always contains a slender
bundle, a fact which has been previously overlooked.

ndle-system of the appendages then, is clear; each bract receives a single
om the axis; immediately on entering the verticil the bundle gives off two
â€˜in an upward and inward direction. These branches constitute the bundles
) sporangiophores corresponding to the bract in question. The determination
t supplies the answer to a question raised by M.
