division is 1:73 millim. long. In order to avoid the difficulty which arises from the
alteration of resistance of plug contacts, we have made a slight innovation. We have
placed all the coils in series, and between each of them we have brought a stout
clamping terminal to the top of the box. Connection is made to the coils which it is
desired to use by means of stout terminals attached to flexible leads. The diagram
shows how the resistance of these leads is compensated. The ‘‘dummy” leads used
to compensate the thermometer leads are made too short by the length of the
flexible leads, which are, of course, made of the same wire as the dummy leads,
Assuming that the temperatures of the dummy leads and of the flexible leads are the
same, this gives a perfect compensation.

The advantage of choosing the particular value of the box unit above mentioned
lies in the resulting fact that, setting aside corrections, the box is direct reading ; the
disadvantage is that with any other thermometers the box would lead to inconvenient
arithmetic. The apparatus is only intended to measure temperatures between 5° C,
and 35° C., consequently the large coil of the box has the same resistance as the
thermometer at 5° C. The contact on the bridge wire is also of manganin, to reduce
thermoelectric action, and there is no difficulty in subdividing the bridge divisions to
tenths by estimation, 7.e., in reading to one-thousandth of a degree. We use one of
Ayrton and Maruer’s D’Arsonval galvanometers and find it very sensitive and
portable.

The following constants will end our discussion of this matter :—
