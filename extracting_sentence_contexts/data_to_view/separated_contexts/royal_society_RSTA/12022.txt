It has been shown, however, by
= Witeerrorcet that the velocity of light is not sensibly altered by motion along a
29 field of electric displacement, so far negativing any theory that would connect electric
3 ‘displacement with considerable bodily velocity of the ether; and it has also been
‘8 verified, by Lord RaviricH, that the transfer of an electric current across an electro-
S lyte does not affect the velocity of light in it.
8 As motion of the wether represents magnetic force, the fact that the magnetic
i permeability is almost the same in all sensibly non-magnetic bodies as in a vacuum
= must be taken to indicate that the sether flows with practically its full velocity in all
é such media, so that there is very little obstruction interposed by the matter; it
+= follows that, in the motion of a body through the ether, the outside sther remains
g at rest instead of flowing round its sides. The sther we thus assume to be at rest
*g in any region, except it be a field of magnetic force, even though masses are moving
= through the region; so that the coefficient of Fresnet, which is null for free sether
HE and very small for but slightly ponderable media, would represent simply a change of
A Velocity due to slight unilateral change of effective elasticity somehow produced by
the motion through the quiescent medium of the vortices constituting the matter.
74. The notion of illustrating magnetic induction by the permeation of a fluid
through a porous medium containing obstacles to its motion has been shown by Lord
' Ketvryt to lead to a complete formal representation of the facts of diamagnetism ;
