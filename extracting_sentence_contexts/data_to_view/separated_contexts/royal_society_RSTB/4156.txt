It is pointed out that the theory of the origin of the mammalian vomer from
the fusion of the prevomers of a reptile and their subsequent growth backwards
along the nasal septum is, to some extent, supported by the conditions of the
prevomers in Emys and Crocodiles, but that as the approach to a mammalian
condition seen in those reptiles is dependent on a great reduction of the paraseptal
cartilages, the apparent resemblance to the mode of origin of the mammalian vomer
is probably deceptive. This view of the origin of the mammalian yomer is also
supported by the paired origin of that bone in many forms.

of bony splints having exactly the same relation to the paraseptal cartilages as the

prevomers of a lizard. This fact seems to demonstrate the strict homology of these
two bones. As in this embryo (as Prof. Witson has shown) a definite palatal
process of the premaxilla is also present, these bones cannot be interpreted merely as
parts of that bone.
