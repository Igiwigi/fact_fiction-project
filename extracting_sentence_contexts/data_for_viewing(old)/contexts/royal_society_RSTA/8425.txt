of (3.25), would each have their sets of daily multipliers and each constituent would
yield two sets of hourly sums.

10.1. The hourly sums would have to be analysed by formuls such as those for
X,, Y, but limited to 24 hours. In order to isolate contributions from a particular species
we found it necessary for the formule to be extended outside the 24 hours. Con-
sequently, by the procedure outlined above, the corrections for any given constituent
would have to be made for all other constituents, and not for those of the same species
only.

10.2. Such in essence is BOrGEN’s method, but the daily multipliers are replaced
by +1, and so the principles of the Least Square Rule are still further ignored. There
is probably no real objection to this simplification, and, in fact, the author has supplied
the Hydrographer with a method of analysis of tidal observations extending over 29
days, in which the multipliers for both daily and hourly processes are +1.

10.3. The instructions by Dr. Hessen,* however, imply that only one out of the
two possible sets of 24 hourly sums is evaluated except when known conjugate con-
stituents with equal and opposite values of 9 necessitate both. This simplification is
equivalent to the arbitrary choice of half the functions X,,, provided by the T.I.
method. ‘lo compute all the possible functions by BOrcEn’s method would approxi-
mately double the work, whereas in the T.I. method there is very little temptation to
compute only half the functions, as the final processes are very simple and easily
performed, owing to the condensation of the material at each stage.
