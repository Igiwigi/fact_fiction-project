The author notes that the basophile reaction of the cytoplasm, though
strongly marked in the younger ova, slowly fades away as growth advances. A
similar behaviour of the cytoplasm is described by Meap (1897) for the ova of
Cheetopterus, and by Grirren (1899) for those of Zirphzea. This resemblance in the
staining reaction of the general cytoplasm to that which I have described for Antedon
is considerably strengthened in the case of Molgula by the fact that in the latter
type “sublimate fixation so affected the yolk as to make it retain the hematoxylin
stain even after the chromatin became pale.” In striking contrast to the rational mode of origin suggested, though tentatively,


ON THE GROWTH OF THE OOCYTE IN ANTEDON. 477

by Crampton for the yolk nucleus of Molgula we have the accounts of MERTENS
(1895) for various birds and mammals, Crery (1895) for Distomum, Hennequy
(1893) for Syngnathus, and BAMBEKE (1898) for Pholeus, by which the yolk nucleus
is made to arise from a single small granule, which is ejected or budded off from the
nucleus, and which subsequently attains its full size by independent growth in the
cytoplasm, a mode of origin which, since it postulates a complex organisation and
semi-autonomous metabolism for the yolk nucleus, is at least in harmony with the
subsequent active share in yolk formation assumed by these authors for this
structure.
