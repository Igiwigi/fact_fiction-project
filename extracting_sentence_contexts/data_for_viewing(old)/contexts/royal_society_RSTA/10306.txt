With this arrangement the temperature could not be raised above 36°C., but
observations at 75°C. and 100°C. were also taken by employing the method of
heating described earlier in this paper. I do not attach much importance to the
numbers obtained, on account of the defective form of heating jacket employed, but
the results can be relied on in so far as they show that the rigidity modulus of steel
is a perfectly definite quantity, and that its rate of decrease with increasing
temperature is constant also.

Table VII. contains the values of the rigidity modulus at the various temperatures.
Each was calculated from the mean of a large number of observations (in most cases
more than 20) at the temperature given. It must be stated that the results have
been tabulated in descending order of temperature—not in the order in which they
were obtained. This accounts for the fact that in two or three cases results are given
at very nearly the same temperatures. These were taken at different times, weeks
apart, in order to see if the rigidity came back to its original value after the wire had
been heated to a higher temperature.
