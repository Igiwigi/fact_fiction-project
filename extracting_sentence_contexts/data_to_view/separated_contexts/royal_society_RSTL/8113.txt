3NO,+4NH,=3NO, NH,-+N,

S the N being equivalent to the H,, which appears simultaneously at the negative
& electrode. No reduction of the nitrate to a less oxidized alt takes place at the negative elec-
trode. This is a fact of so0me interest, because it is opposed to the hypothesis that a
nascent body possesses a chemical activity not belonging to it in its ordinary free con-
dition ; for here is. basylous hydrogen, at the -moment of its liberation, exerting no
action on the nitrate, although zinc and other metals x0 readily reduce it under various

conditions, including that of its solution in ammonia®. * Ammonium amalgam als» appears to have during its decomposition no reducing action upon a nitrate,
a fact, however, which may be due to the amalgam not being really a compound of ammonium.
