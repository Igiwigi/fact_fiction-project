interesting variation is found in specimen E, where the skull conforms perfectly
only if the pineal is placed just behind the line of the other pineals. Also the nose
of this specimen is a little broader than that of the slightly larger specimen F. Such
differences may be due to natural variation or possibly sexual dimorphism.

This series shows the changes in proportion of the skull which take place during
growth. The increase in the length of the skull is made up of akout 42% in the
increase in the nose anterior to the orbits, 35°, in the region between the pineal
foramen and the front of the orbits, and 23°%, between the pineal and the back of the
parietal crest. Also while the length has increased by about 35% the width has
increased by about 50%.

Restorations in side view are much less satisfactory owing to the fact that the
majority of skulls have been crushed. Specimens H and F are very little distorted,
however, and a fairly reliable restoration can be made of specimen C, fig. 4.

It will be seen from this series that the canine tooth occupies a constant position,
and the post-canines remain close to it and do not occupy a much greater space in the
old specimens than they do in the young. The result of this is that whereas in the
