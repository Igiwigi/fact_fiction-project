ther the doubly refracting structure is communicated trans-

iently or permanently ;—and the appearance of regular cleay-

ages varying with the direction of the axes of double refrac-

tion, are facts which render it more than probable that a

peculiar fluid is the principal agent in producing all the phe»

nomena of crystallization and double refraction. " |
There is one fact, however, which forms a fine connection

between the aberration of the extraordinary ray and the prin- ;

ciples established in this Paper. It has been demonstrated by |

an eminent English, philosopher,* that every undulation must

assume a spheroidal form when propagated through a minutely

stratified substance, in which the density is greater in one

direction than another, and I have proved by experiment
