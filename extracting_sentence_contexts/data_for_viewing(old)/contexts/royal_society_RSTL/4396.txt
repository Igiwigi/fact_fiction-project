From communications I have been favoured with, it appears that the deflections
of the telegraph needles on the 24th of September were general throughout the
kingdom. They were observed on the South Devon line and in Scotland, as well
as on all the lines in this part of the country ; and it is worthy of remark, that all the
reports of the telegraph clerks agree nearly in the time of the commencement of the
disturbance, the earliest time stated being 11-35 a.m., and the latest noon.

The 23rd of October was another day of strong deflections, and a partial register
was kept of them in London by Mr. Harcutr. They were equally strong on the
Midland line, and I have accounts of them as far as Newecastle. The 24th being
Sunday, there was no register kept; but they continued on the 25th, and were again
registered by Mr. HaTcuzs in London, who has favoured me with his observations ;
but beyond the fact of the unusual disturbance, they throw no additional light on
this snbject.

66 MR, W. H. BARLOW ON THE SPONTANEOUS ELECTRICAL CURRENTS

I have no magnetic observations on the 23rd, 24th, or 25th of October, but I have
since learnt that an unusual magnetic disturbance occurred on these days, and there
appears no doubt of the coincidence of these great disturbances in both instruments.

On the three occasions mentioned, namely, the 19th of March, the 24th and 25th
