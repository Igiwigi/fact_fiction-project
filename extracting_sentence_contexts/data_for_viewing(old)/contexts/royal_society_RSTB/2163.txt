the cerebro-spinal substance which had been kept some days and had undergone
decomposition ; it is well known that choline is readily changed into neurine by this
means, and the solution was now more toxic, giving the same results which solutions
of neurine exhibit.

9. EXPERIMENTS ON THE CEREBRAL VESSELS.

It appeared possible to us that some of the symptoms of General Paralysisâ€™ of the
Insane might be produced by the local action of choline on the vessels of the brain,
similar to that which it produces on the mesenteric vessels. It appeared to us highly
important to investigate this question, for it is in the neighbourhood of the cerebral
vessels that the poison is being continually produced. At the same time, we were
aware of the fact that, although nerve-fibres have been shown by histological
methods to exist in these vessels, it has not yet been possible for physiologists to
discover by experimental methods any evidence of vaso-motor action in this region
of the body.

In carrying out these experiments, we were fortunate enough to secure the
assistance of Mr. Leonarp Hint, whose name is so closely associated with this
branch of research.

The animals used were dogs, and the anzsthetics employed were morphine and
chloroform. A tracing of arterial blood-pressure was obtained from the carotid by a
mercurial kymograph. Manometers filled with salt solution coloured with methylene
blue were connected with the torcula and with the jugular vein; these manometers
