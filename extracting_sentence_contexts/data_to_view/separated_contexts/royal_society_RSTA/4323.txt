But since z is a uniform function of ¢, the only points where u can have branch-
points, considered as a function of ¢, are the points where uw has branch-points
considered as a function of z; that is, the points @, @,...@i+2 Hence, wu is a
uniform function of ¢.

Thus, any algebraic curve can be uniformised by means of groups of substitutions
formed from self-inverse substitutions. It will be seen that a great similarity exists between the place occupied by self-
inverse substitutions, in the theory of groups of projective substitutions, and the

place oceupied by branch-points at which only two branches interchange, in the
theory of Riemann surfaces; the usefulness of the method of self-inverse substi-
tutions depends on the fact that algebraic forms can be represented on Riemann
surfaces with only simple branch-points. Algebraic functions are not, however, the only ones which can be uniformised. Porncar&* has proved a general existence-theorem that, if 4, %,...
