Such exponential potentials are
uniquitous in string theory constructions (see e.g. [45]). For example, the radius r of one of iS
the extra spatial dimensions of string theory yields a scalar field g via an exponential relation iS
g/mp1 ~ exp(r/I;), and hence a power-law potential energy function for the radion r leads to an 1S
exponential potential for g. The fact that a negative sign arises is related to the fact that the ground {=
state in superstring theory is typically AdS. The steepness of the potential is consistent with the 8
de Sitter criterion, as a generalization of the derivation of the de Sitter constraint to the case of :=
negative potentials has shown [39]. i=
