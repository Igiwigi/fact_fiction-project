A solid
amalgam of bismuth and a solid amalgam of lead become
fluid when mixed together: the experiment, I find, is con-
nected with a diminution of temperature, but with no exhi-
bition of electrical effects. A thin plate of zinc, after being
placed upon a surface of mercury, and separated by an insu-
lating body, is found positive, the mercury is negative : the
effects are exalted by heating the metals; but let them be kept
in contact sufficiently long to amalgamate, and the compound
gives no signs of electricity. I could mention a great number
of other instances of pure chemical action-in which I have used
all the means in my power to ascertain the fact, and the result
has been constantly the same. In cases of effervescence, in-
deed, particularly when accompanied by much heat, the metallic
vessels employed become negative, but this is a phanomenon
connected with evaporation, the change of state of a body inde-
pendent of chemical change, and is to be referred to. a different
law,*
