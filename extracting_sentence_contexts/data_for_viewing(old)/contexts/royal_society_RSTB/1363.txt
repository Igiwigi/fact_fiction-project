The Degeneration in the Cranial Nerve Roots.

Optic Nerve.—The optic tract of the right side is divided in removal of one cerebral
hemisphere. Corresponding with this there appears to be complete blindness of the
right eye, and slight curtailment of the field of vision of the lefteye. I have reserved
however for subsequent investigation the disputed point, whether in the cat there is
complete decussation or slight bifurcation. In Gourz’s dog, described by LANGLEY and

‘Grineaum,* the lesion in the region of the root of the optic tract is much less than
in my cases. This will account for the fact that, whereas Gourz’s dog could see with
the right eye, my cats could not.

IIIrd Nevve.—The third nerve appears frequently to be injured after its exit from
the mesencephalon. The root and the oculo-motor nucleus usually escape injury. I
have not been able to demonstrate fibres from the region of the posterior corpora
quadrigemina or from the posterior commissure entering either of the [[rd nerves.
Nor have I traced a certain connection between the posterior longitudinal bundle and
these nerves.

a Vth Nerve.—The descending root of the Vth nerve appears to commence in a focus
it about the level of the upper oculo-motor nucleus and immediately behind it ; it
