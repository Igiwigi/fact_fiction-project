This
temperature was determined for the various substances in the following manner. Small
strips of the material were touched with a narrow porcelain tube containing a thermo-
couple, the tube being heated in an electric furnace, the temperature of which was
maintained at the temperature of the test. The experimental procedure consisted in
rapidly withdrawing the tube from the furnace and momentarily touching it with the
edge of the sample under test, the fact being noted whether the sample burst into
flame or not. The temperature of the furnace was then reduced and the samples
re-tested. In this way they arrived at a lower limit to the temperature of instantaneous
decomposition.
