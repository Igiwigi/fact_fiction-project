The root in question is not present in the case 6 = 1 (this is in fact the classical Biot instability
of an elastic half space as the two layers can no longer be distinguished), but, when it exists, it

Figure 2. The maxima of the dispersion curves of det(M) = 0 in the A-k plane provide the first critical values of A at which :
oscillatory solutions can be obtained. For instance, the critical compression A, and wavenumber K,, are indicated for the top a
curve. The curves from top to bottom are obtained for decreasing values of 6 € {10, 5/2, 5/4, 5/16}. (Online version in colour.) a
