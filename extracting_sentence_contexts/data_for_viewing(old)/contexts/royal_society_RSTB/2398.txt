near the proximal end, especially as the sporangium is here scarcely if at all attached
to the sporophyll beneath. The sporangium has the same organisation as in the Coal-
Measure species; the outer layer of its wall has the customary columnar structure,
and is lined by a delicate tissue, several cells in thickness. The integument, which
just overtops the sporangium, is formed of dense fibrous tissue, and the sporophyll-
pedicel is also, for the most part, of firm construction. This section corresponds very
nearly with one through the proximal region of Z. Lomawi, cut a little further out
than that shown in phot. 14. Other tangential sections of L. Wildianum, cut no
doubt in planes further from the axis of the parent cone, are of much greater breadth»
show the attachment of the sporangium clearly, and, in fact, present the same
features as the corresponding sections of L. Lomasi.

A series of four sections from one “seed,” cut in parallel, nearly horizontal* planes,
is of interest, especially as this aspect has not been illustrated in the former species.
Three of the sections are represented in figs. 17, 18, and 20. The proximal end
(with reference to the parent cone) is to the left, and the distal to the right, in all the
figures. Fig. 17 is from the lowest of the series. The plane of section throughout
the series is not strictly horizontal, but somewhat inclined, the distal end of the
section being at a lower level than the proximal. Thus, in fig. 17 the distal
extremity is missed, the plane of section here passing below the sporophyll. The
vascular bundle of the sporophyll appears at three places, twice at the proximal and
once at the distal end. On entering the sporophyll it made a sharp curve, which is
