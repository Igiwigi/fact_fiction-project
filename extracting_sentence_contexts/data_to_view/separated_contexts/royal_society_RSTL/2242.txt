Experiment g.

Procure a frame of a moderate size ; stretch across it a
number of very fine threads of glass, or of fine wire, parallel
to each other. At right angles to these, and at the same
distance, stretch other threads of glass or wire, s0 as to divide
the whole frame into a great number of small squares. Brush
the whole over with a very broad camel-hair pencil, dipped


142 Mr. Ritcnts on the permeability of transparent

in the white of an egg, and a very delicate transparent liquid
Screen will be formed, Place the screen between the dif-
ferential thermometer with cylindrical chambers, (a descrip-
tion of which has already been laid before the Society®) and the
heated body, and the following facts will be observed. _

15t. Raise the ball to a low temperature, keep the screen
almost at the same temperature, by constantly applying the
white of an egg mixed with cold water, to the upper side of
the frame, and no sensible effect will be observed on the
instrument. 2nd, Raise the ball to the temperature at which it has just
ceased to be visible in the dark ; place it at a greater distance,
and a very striking effect will immediately be observed.
