On closing the circuit, the
needle 8wings at once up to, and then oscillates about its ultimate position of rest, and
stays there while the current is passing. On breaking the circuit, the needle at once
returns, oscillates on either side of, and then stops at zero. During these experiments we were frequently struck by the analogy of the two cases,
and impressed with the idea that cutting off the light was, in point of fact, removing
the electromotor of the current. 342 PROFESSOR W. G. ADAMS AND MR. R. E. DAY ON THE

In these investigations we have seen :â€”

(1) That a slight increase of temperature of a piece of annealed selenium is accom-
panied by a large increase of electrical resistance,

(2) That on increasing the strength of the current through the selenium, there was a
diminution in its resistance, which seems to be due to a kind of polarization which is
8imilar in its effects to electrolytic polarization. 'This polarization seems to be a perma-
nent effect, or at least, to last for a long time, so long as the ends of the selenium are
not short-circuited.
