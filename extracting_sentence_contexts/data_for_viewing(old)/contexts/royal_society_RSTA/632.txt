algorithms are also required to integrate the extra information acquired from all dimensions. In : 5.
some cases, different tomography modalities can be combined in order to obtain a tomogram iS

with multiple sensing features [60]. One example is to combine EIT and ECT together to realize
the three-phase gas/oil/water flow [61]. Nevertheless, for all cases, further studies on the data
fusion method are necessary in order to realize the multidimensional approach.

5. Reconstruction algorithms :S
The function of reconstruction algorithms is to convert the tomography sensor measurements into : a
a tomogram that represents the electrical property distributions. 1S
Owing to the fact that electrical tomography techniques generally have a low spatial resolution 7
compared with hard-field tomography techniques, there has been much research on new : Sg
reconstruction algorithm developments [62-65]. The common goal of these new algorithms is :B
to improve electrical tomography’s ill-posed nature, aiming to achieve a better spatial resolution 73
and image accuracy. Ideally, a good algorithm needs to have the following features: : x

— high accuracy;
— low computational complexity; and
— robustness.

Unfortunately, it is really difficult to have an algorithm that satisfies all these features. In the past
few decades, there have been many studies on new algorithm designs. Some of the algorithms that
do not require high computational resources have been implemented for commercial application
