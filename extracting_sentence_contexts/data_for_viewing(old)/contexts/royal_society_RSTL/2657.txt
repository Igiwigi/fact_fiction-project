second, and third pairs. These bubbles diminish in size as we proceed towards the
posterior extremity of the insect, the first and second pairs being the largest. During
the changes of the insect these spiracles are greatly increased in size, and often con-
siderably altered in form, while the spiracles and trachez in the posterior portion of
the body are greatly diminished, and the anal pair which existed in the larya is

entirely obliterated. The quantity of air expired through the different orifices must
therefore be greater at the anterior than at the posterior ones. But if one of the
larger Humble-bees (Bomb:) be placed in water, and allowed to remain completely
submerged until it has become nearly asphyxiated, the fact will then be still more
apparent. At first there will be two large bubbles expired from the anterior spi-
racles, on each side of the trunk, at each longitudinal contraction of the abdominal
segments, which corresponds to each expiration ; but as the insect becomes more
completely asphyxiated, the bubble of air will be only partially expelled from the spi-
racle, and again withdrawn at the entrance, without having escaped, at each longi-
tudinal extension of the segments, which corresponds to each inspiration, while not
a 8ingle bubble of air can be detected at the entrance of the posterior abdominal seg-
ments*, Tt is evident from this that it is chiefly through the anterior spiracles that
respiration is performed ; and it may from hence be inferred that the manner in which
the insect prepares itself for flight is exactly like that of birds under similar circum-
stances. At the moment of elevating its elytra and expanding its wings the anterior
pairs of spiracles are opened in the act of inspiration, and the air rushing into them
