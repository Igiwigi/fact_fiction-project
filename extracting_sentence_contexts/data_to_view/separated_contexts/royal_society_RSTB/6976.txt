At the level of the
ventral longitudinal muscles it gives off a branch which extends medianly to ramify and
disappear among the parenchyma occupying the spaces between these muscles. Only when
it reaches the dorso-lateral region of the trunk does it open into a sinus which runs forward
into the lower part of the prosoma. This represents the body cavity in which the dorsal
longitudinal muscles lie and the sinus in fact follows the course of these muscles. The sinuses
on either side do not join across underneath the dorsal side of the gut in the hinder part of
the trunk, as the gut parenchyma extends medially as far as the body wall and so forms a
barrier. In the prosomal region, however, the parenchyma only stretches to the mid-dorsal

body wall in separate strands or pillars and so the sinuses become confluent and form
simply a dorsal blood space (figure 12).
