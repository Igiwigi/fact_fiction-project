modification was obtained by means of a mercury cup placed outside the bath, but in
the axis of oscillation of the platform.

An experiment with four sulphuric acid vessels in series was then made, with the
air current running for 92 hours, the temperature of the bath being constant at about
30°C. The Ist vessel gained 0°0021 gr., 2nd 0°0010 gr., 3rd 0:0012 gr., and 4th
00018 gr. It was now thought that possibly these changes in weight were due to the
absorption of mercury vapour by the sulphuric acid. An attempt to test this was
made by furnishing two out of the four vessels with gold sleeves suspended in the
entry tubes. A run of 92 hours at 30° C. gave 0°0018 gr., 0°0013 gr., 0°0004 gr., and
0°0010 gr. respectively, and the gold sleeves were not found to have altered in weight.

Hitherto the vessels, while on the balance, had not been closed; in view of the fact
that the errors now seemed to be considerably less than heretofore, it was thought
better to have vessels made with their entry and exit tubes fitted with ground-
glass stoppers. These vessels were then tested as before.
