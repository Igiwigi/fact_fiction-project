Introduction

Stars more massive than about 8Mo end their lives
as incredibly luminous explosions known as core-
Sean M. Couch collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Observationally, this
e-mail: couchsea@msu.edu is a fact. We have directly observed massive stars
erupt into CCSNe and then disappear after the
explosion has faded. The most famous case of direct
observation is SN 1987A [1], but we have now
directly identified a few dozen CCSN progenitors [2,3].
