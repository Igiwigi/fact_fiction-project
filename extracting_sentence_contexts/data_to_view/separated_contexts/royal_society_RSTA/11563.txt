An infinite number of such stress-systems might in fact be specified, for
there are six components of stress which need satisfy only three conditions. if
however the stress system is required to be symmetrical with respect to the lines of
polarization, there is in this respect no indefiniteness (§ 40); and the one given by
von Hetmuonrz is of this kind. Thus the definite result really deduced by
von Hetmuottz from his energy hypothesis is an expression for the bodily
mechanical forcive in the polarized medium, the (X, Y, Z) of equation (4) of his
memoir; while correlative formule are applied by him and by Krrcuuorr for the
bodily forcive in a magnetized medium. These expressions, however, definitely
contradict the formule of Maxwe 1 and of the other previous writers for the bodily
mechanical forcive in a magnetized medium, which are in general agreement with
those developed in this paper: in fact von Hetmuorrz translates his formule into
MAXweEtw’s electric stress system, while MAxwett himself had to invent for the
case of magnetic polarization, which was the one he considered, a different stress-
system, namely his magnetic stress. As recent writers have in the main tacitly
accepted von Hetmuourz’s procedure, it is incumbent on us to assign the origin of
this discrepancy ; and for this purpose a summary of his method is given, the effect
of alteration of the coefficient of polarization arising from strain in the material being
for the present left out of account.

65. The organized electric energy in the polarized medium being assumed, from
other considerations, to be

w= | K/8m . (dV2/da® + dV2/dy? + dV?/dz’) dr,

where

d/da (K dV /dx) + d/dy (KdV /dy) + d/dz(KdV/dz) + 4zp = 0,

in which p is a constant associated with the element of dielectric matter, called
the density of its free electric charge, the forces acting will be derived from
the variation of W; variation with respect to V leads to the electric forces,
and that with respect to the material configuration leads to the mechanical
ones.
