I have done s0 only that I might point with the more facility to facts and views that
have heretofore been associated with some supposed polarity in the bodies which,
whether paramagnetic or diamagnetic, I have been considering as mere conductors,
and I hope that no mistake of my meaning will arise in consequence. I have already
asked for such liberty in the use of phrases (lines of force, conducting power, &C.)
(2149. 2797.) as may, for the time, set me free from the bondage of preconceived
notions; these are, for that very reason, exceedingly useful, provided they are for the
time sufficiently restricted in their meaning, and do not admit of any hurtful Joose-
ness or inaccuracy in the representation of facts. Ã¾ iii. Magnecrystallic conduction*.
