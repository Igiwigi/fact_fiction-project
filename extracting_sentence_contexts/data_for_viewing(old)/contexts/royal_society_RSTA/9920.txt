of the P and § series was about °487, so that the p’s of P and § are of the form
‘987+f and 5+f. This agreement for about ‘987 from two lines of agreement
strengthens the case for each.

Again, if the values of «/f (u = ‘986+f) be calculated, there results

a much nearer approximation to equality than before ; in fact, 1950 well within all
limits. :

We are therefore led to surmise that the P series of all the alkalies can be
represented by a formula,

the numbers inserted being only very roughly approximate. In other words, the
knowledge of four constants (N, ‘486+? 195+? and k) gives all the lines of all the P
series of the alkalies (Li not considered).
