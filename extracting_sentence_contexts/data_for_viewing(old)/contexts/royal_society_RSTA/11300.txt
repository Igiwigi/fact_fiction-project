actually exposed to equally intense radiation throughout, is not due to diffusion of
Ethe nuclei before expansion, or mixing of the air in the tube in consequence of the
"3 expansion, is certain, For, in the experiments in which there was a deposit of dew on
4 the quartz, no fog was produced at the far end, even with an exposure of 60 seconds ;
S while a very dense fog was obtained near the quartz with an equal expansion, with an
exposure of only 10 seconds. Similar results were obtained in experiments in which
=the Cadmium points were displaced to one side, so that only a small portion of the
gs tube near the quartz was exposed to the rays. The fog obtained on expansion only
& extended a short distance beyond the part of the tube reached by the rays.
3 The experiments with this apparatus make the superficial origin of the nuclei
8 very improbable; for, if they arose only where the rays fell on a surface, the fogs
would have been confined to the ends of the tube. ‘To account otherwise for
A the fact that whenever a fog was produced (with the light passing axially) it was
uniform from end to end of the tube, we would have to suppose that on account of
undetected scattering of the ultra-violet rays at the ends, the walls throughout the
whole length of the tube received approximately uniform ultra-violet illumination.
Perhaps the most striking proof that the nuclei produced by ultra-violet light are
formed throughout the volume of the moist air, and not at the surface of the vessel
containing it, is furnished by experiments with very strong radiation. As already
stated in a preliminary note on the subject (‘Camb. Phil. Soc. Proe.,’ vol, 9, p. 392),
under the influence of very strong ultra-violet light fogs are produced without any
expansion, even in unsaturated air, The nuclei which, when they are only exposed
