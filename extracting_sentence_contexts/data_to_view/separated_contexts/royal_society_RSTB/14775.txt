The laws of thermodynamics
including and especially the first law, the law of energy con-
servation fit into that category. In that sense, they are
underlying theoretical frameworks for much of what was dis-
cussed. In fact, often the theories presented and discussed at
our conference dealt with evolutionary explanation of why
we have obesity as a phenotype. Other things discussed are
closer to the idea of theories in the sense that the general
public often uses the word. We operated at both levels.
