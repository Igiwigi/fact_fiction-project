The explanation offered is based mainly upon the observations which
have been made on the aggregation of Huglena viridis. Two distinct phenomena have
to be accounted for : (1) the cyclic up and down movements, and (2) the attraction of
the motile organisms into networks and groups. Both are concerned in the aggre-
gation, but (2) is dependent on (1), and both are primarily dependent upon (a) the
obvious fact that Euglena is capable of autonomous movements, and (b), which is
perhaps not so obvious, that it is distinctly heavier than water. The first problem
we have to consider, therefore, is the density of Euglena.

1. The Density of Euglena viridis,

If a tube about half an inch in diameter is filled with water containing a sufficient
number of Euglenz to give it a distinct green colour, and placed upright in the dark,
the majority of the organisms will, in the course of a few minutes, sink in the water
and form a dense green mass at the bottom of the tube.
