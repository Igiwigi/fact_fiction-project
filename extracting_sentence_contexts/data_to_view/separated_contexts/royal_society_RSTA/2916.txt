New exciting applications in this area span
from large civil structures for deployment against seismic load and aircraft wings that exhibit
morphing properties through space deployable antennas and various micro-electromechanical
systems. Understanding the detailed dynamics and precise functionalities of complex adaptive
structures poses many challenges to designers. This is mainly due to the fact that functional
materials and hybrid-based mechatronic designs used in adaptive structures are often associated
with non-stationarity, nonlinearity and ambiguity with respect to vibration analysis and dynamic
testing. The classical approaches used for vibration and identification of linear time-invariant
(LTI) systems are well established and use various parametric/non-parametric and input-
output/output-only methods. The well-known frequency response function (FRF) is one of the

most widely used non-parametric input-output approaches.
