the various genera ; that a similar parallelism occurs within each genus making the
diagnostic features of every lineage very difficult to determine.

In his detailed work on Cretaceous Asteroidea (1913, p. 101), Spencer similarly _
makes a series of evolutionary propositions. They are :—

(1) “That Cretaceous Asteroidea belong only exceptionally to modern genera. The
fauna is Mesozoic and has no general relationship with the Tertiary forms.” The fact
that fairly complete lineages of Cretaceous Polyzoa, when followed up, lead to such
massively elaborated forms that further evolution (without resorption of the skeleton)
is hard to imagine, has already forced me to the same conclusion.

(2) “That the starfish may be separated into lineages (‘species series’) which
preserve unbroken continuity during their life-history.” This, in Cretaceous Polyzoa,
is the theme of the present paper.

(3) “ That if the variation of individual characters in a lineage be considered they
are (a) usually of a continuous type, (>) frequently independent of one another.” A
consideration of the Cretaceous Polyzoan lineages described above, and a glance at the
diagrams will verify both these points. The distal pair of avicularia in Pelmatopora,
