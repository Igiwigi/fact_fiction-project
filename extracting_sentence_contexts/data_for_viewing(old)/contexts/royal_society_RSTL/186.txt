modifications are to be derived.

The relations of these solids to each other is most distinctly
exhibited to those who are not much conversant with crystal-
lography, by assuming the tetrahedron as primitive, for this
may immediately be converted 'into an octohedron by the
removal of four smaller tetrahedrons from its solid angles.
(Fig. 1.)

The substance which most readily admits of division by
fracture into these forms is fluor spar ; and there is no dif-
culty in obtaining a sufficient quantity for such experiments,
But it is not, in fact, either the tetrahedron or the octohedron,
which first presents itself as the apparent primitive form ob-
tained by fracture. Â»

If we form a plate of uniform thickness by two successive
divisions of the 8par, parallel to each other, we shall find the
