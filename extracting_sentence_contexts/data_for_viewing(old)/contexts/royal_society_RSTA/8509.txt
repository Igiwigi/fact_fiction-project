The chief part of the precise current-information obtained from observation is
shown in fig. 12, and it is interesting to compare the currents at the individual stations
with those of the foregoing theory.

THE PRINCIPAL CONSTITUENT OF THE TIDES OF THE NORTH SEA. 193

Stations Sc and D, are both near the northern bounding section, so that the fact
of their currents reaching a southerly maximum about ct = 0 has been assumed (fig. 4).
The practical absence of rotation at Sc is in accordance with our theory.

Stations E,, E,, E, and D, lie near the loop of fig. 5 and at ot = 0 their currents are
directed towards the English coast, thus agreeing with fig. 4. At of = 90° E, has a
strong southerly current, E, a weaker southerly current and E, practically zero current,
while D, has a small northerly current. These observational facts agree well with
fig. 7.

Station Da, has a westerly current at of = 0 and a northerly current at ot = 90°,
which facts agree well with figs. 4 and 7 respectively.
