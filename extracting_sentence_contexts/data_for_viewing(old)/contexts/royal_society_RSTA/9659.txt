gmagnitude of the applied stress-system, or “ load.”
<< These “curves of distortion” are of considerable utility for the study oc problems
Sin elastic stability, even though their true form can only be guessed. hey help us,
Bfor example, to explain, and in some degree to remedy, the serious discrepancy
sexisting between Evuer’s theory and the results of experiments on short struts.
‘The discrepancy has often been attributed to practical imperfections of form ; but it
‘sshould hardly be necessary to point out that practical imperfections are likely to
iminish rather than to increase in importance, as the dimensions of an elastic solid
-2become more nearly comparable, so that they will never be more effective as causes of
weakness than in struts of great length, which, as a matter of fact, give results in
Belose agreement with Euer’s formula.
S A more satisfactory explanation of this, and of similar discrepancies in other
Eproblems, may be found in the fact that the ordinary theory of elastic stability
“gheglects the possibility of elastic break-down. If we attempt to draw “curves of
Sdistortion” for any single problem, we shall find that, apart from the other data of
‘Ythe problem, three possible cases exist, depending upon the elastic limit of the material
‘Sunder consideration :—

E (1) The material may be of infinite strength ;
fas (2) Its elastic limit may be so high that the critical load, as determined by the
theory of instability, is not sufficient to cause elastic break-down in the
configuration of equilibrium ;
(3) Elastic break-down may occur, even in the position of equilibrium, at a load less
than the critical value.
