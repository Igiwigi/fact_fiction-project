They differ from one another by the rigid-body motion
just defined, characterized by translation a(t) and rotation Q(t). By computing the time derivative
of y’ and pulling back from 0’ to O the velocity i, we define a new velocity j/* to be

i =Q'y =clt) +q() x Y—yo) +h, (6.1)

a standard relation in which c := Q!a and q is the axial vector of the skew-symmetric tensor Qa. Changing coordinates in the physical space alters also the perception of the microstructures,
which are, in fact, in that space, within the deformed configuration, once u has been applied. Their separate representation on the manifold M is just a model choice, which must account the
physical perception of the body. For this reason, we define a link between changes in observers in
the physical space, determined in general by elements of Diff(E°, €°), the space of one-to-one
differentiable maps with differentiable inverse (diffeomorphisms in short) of €° onto itself—
rotations and translations are special cases—and transformations of the atlas on the manifold M,
given by elements of Diff(M, M), the group of diffeomorphism mapping M onto itself.
