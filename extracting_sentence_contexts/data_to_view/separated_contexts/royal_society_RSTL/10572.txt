The second paper deals, amongst other topics, with cases of jets of frictionless flaid under certain
hypothetical conditions which approximate to those of the actual jets which come under experiment. It

is 8hown that the instability of the jet, 80 far from increasing without limit with the pitch of the

disturbances, 800 reaches a maximum; and that for disturbances of still shorter wave-length than thoze
which are most effective this instability is finally exchanged for actual stability. Tt is to be hoped that the distinguished anthor of these papers may himself discnss their full bearing
on the facts here recorded, ]
