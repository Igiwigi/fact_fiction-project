The probabilistic
framework forces the scientist to be completely transparent about the assumptions, by expressing
all assumptions as distributions on unknown quantities. These assumptions can then be easily :
contested, and the same data can be reanalysed under different modelling assumptions (and =
priors). The fact that conclusions could change depending on the assumptions is essential to is
good scientific practice. Fortunately, given enough data, the effect of the prior is generally Ss
overcome by the likelihood, and posterior conclusions will converge [4-6]. This is directly :8
analogous to the progress of science, where of many possible hypotheses, only the ones consistent i=
with the data will survive.
