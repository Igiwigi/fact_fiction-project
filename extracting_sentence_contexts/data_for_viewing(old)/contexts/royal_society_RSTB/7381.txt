the minor septa are inserted in a serial manner and some Scleractinia have also serially
inserted septa. Thus it seems possible that there may be a continuous change in the fashion
of septal insertion from serial to cyclic, first affecting the minor and then the major septa
as well. It is true that no consistent correlation between the mode of septal insertion and
the suppression of the counter-lateral sectors is indicated. These characters are not
consistently progressive, but, like most other characters, affect various groups to different
degrees, and for this very reason they should not be accorded too much weight in the
subdivision of the group.


180 H. GC. WANG ON REVISION OF ZOANTHARIA RUGOSA

In view of the facts cited above and as the result of my investigation of the skeletal
structures, I agree on the whole with Ogilvie that the development of the Rugosa and
Scleractinia represents a more or less continuous process, and would incline to the view of
direct descent rather than common ancestry as the true relation between these groups.

Concerning the subdivision of the Rugosa, I have already remarked that the current
tendency has been to lay particular emphasis on septal insertion and septal symmetry.
While the ontogenetic study of septal insertion and septal differentiation affords a valuable
aid for the understanding of phylogenetic relations, it should be admitted that our know-
ledge in this respect is confined to very few genera. Furthermore, acceleration and retarda-
tion often add much to the irregularity and greatly reduce the value of such series in
systematic analysis. Incidentally, it may be noted that, attaching importance to deviations
in septal insertion has led Clark to establish two new genera on some very similar zaphren-
