34. Growth, —Of the mode in which the Nutritive process is carried on in Orbito-
lites, our imperfect acquaintance with their living habits leaves us much in the dark ;
nevertheless it is fair to reason by analogy from a comparison of their structure with
that of other Foraminifera whose habits of life are known ; especially as this analogy
is sufficiently complete in the present instance, to justify a tolerably firm reliance
upon it, and as the results to which it would lead are in harmony with the facts of
observation. All the Orbitolites, whether of the simple or complex type, which have
been collected in the living state, have been found growing on the surface of Sea-
weeds or other marine plants (as Zostera), or of Zoophytes ; it may therefore be fairly
presumed, that such is their ordinary habitat ; and hence it is scarcely conceivable

that their attached surface should ever be invested hy sarcode. Moreover, several
of the spirit-specimens which I have submitted to decalcification, have proved to be
80 closely invested by a covering of vegetation, chiefly composed of Diatomacece,
Desmidiew, and other minute Algz, that I cannot suppose even the free surface of
their disk to be ordinarily covered by sarcode*.
