It follows from this lemma that every element fe P is represented by at least one normal
word we. For the normal word w, — 1 evidently represents the unit element 1 « P; and
if = pd, then the normal word w — wo¢ represents the product 1p = pe P, by lemma (2:8). Moreover, it follows that ¢ is in fact an isomorphism. For if f)¢ P is contained in the
kernel of ¢, that is, if py¢ is the unit element « of 2—the identical permutation of Y—and if
we represents the element pe P, then we = w represents the product p/o- But a word
w can only represent a single element of P; hence ppy = p and fy = 1. Trorem (Schreier 1927).
