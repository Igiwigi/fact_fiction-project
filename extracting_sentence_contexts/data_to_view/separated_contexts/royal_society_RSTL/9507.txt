Nothing is easier than to d18-
tinguish them. Relief phosphorescence is quite fixed in position unless another cont
of production is formed by touching the tube in its immediate neighbourhood, in whis :
cage the two systems of streams of course interfere the one with the other. But eve
when contact is made with the tube it is quite easy to drive this attendant phospho
escence about by bringing other conducting systems into the neighbourhood of
tube, although they do not produce the slightesb effect upon the relief phosph0

* This is confirmed by the fact that it is impossible to cast a shadow upon this attendant phosp!

streams that cause it do not proceed from any one 8pot, but that they converge upon ab T—_ =

Then, again, the shadows cast by the two will often be in different directions.
