Despite the visual similarities between these biological patterns and patterns simulated using
a Turing-type mechanism, many biologists were skeptical of the applicability of a mechanism
that was based predominantly on mathematical and physical-chemical principles [26]. While

some saw the potential feasibility of the Turing mechanism in explaining the development of : 4
hydra tentacles or phyllotaxis in plant buds [27,28], it was at the time experimentally unverifiable 1
[27-29]. In fact, the equations Turing proposed often led to negative morphogen concentrations 8
(a fact he noted in his own work) [1,28]. Thus, the Turing mechanism did not gain much : Ss
popularity among biologists until Gierer and Meinhardt independently rediscovered it in 1972 1S

[30] (they were unaware of Turing’s work until a reviewer pointed it out). Gierer and Meinhardt
also formalized the pattern-forming mechanism into an interaction between two (or two groups
of) chemicals: an ‘activator’ and an ‘inhibitor’ [30].
