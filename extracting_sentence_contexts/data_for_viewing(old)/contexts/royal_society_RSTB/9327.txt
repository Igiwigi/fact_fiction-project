dog breeds and the cancers that they develop accelerates
cancer gene discovery in the field of comparative oncology.

Finally, as a fitting conclusion to our special issue,
Lawrence et al. [54] offer a tangible description of how differ-
ent species respond to cancer chemotherapy. They detail the
development of chemotherapy in humans and its relatively
recent adoption into veterinary medicine. As emphasized in
their paper, Lawrence ef al. [54] describe the poor predictabil-
ity of tumour responses to cancer chemotherapy drugs in
rodent models leading to the subsequent failure of drugs
that might otherwise benefit different species such as dogs
and humans. In fact, pet dogs may actually be the ideal
‘pre-clinical’ models for Phase I, II and III human chemothera-
peutic testing due to similar drug metabolism (both
functionally and genetically), similar cancers that occur natur-
ally, and overall large number of affected individuals to test
[16,54]. This advantage already has been recognized in the
field of pediatric oncology where trials are ongoing for novel
drug therapies for osteosarcoma, a rare bone tumour in
humans but quite common in dogs [55-57]. As Lawrence
et al. [54] highlight, to capture fully the benefits of comparative
oncology for therapeutic advances in cancer treatment for
humans and dogs, we still need to understand better the differ-
ences and similarities in pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics
