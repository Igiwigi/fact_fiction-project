developed an extensive neurofibrillar plexus, and one is prompted to suggest, there-
fore, that some, at least, of them represent the nuclear elements of the sensory cells
of the gut epithelium. This suggestion is only made in view of the fact that,
although no direct evidence has been obtained of the presence of sensory elements
within the gut wall, their presence may be inferred on account of the development
of a basal fibrillar plexus. This being so, the nuclei of the sensory elements should
be visible in preparations which show, in all other respects, excellent fixation. The
rounded nuclei correspond to the rounded nuclei of other parts of the body both in
form and number, while the cigar-shaped bodies similarly correspond to the nuclei
of the primary sense cells of the general ectoderm (fig.
