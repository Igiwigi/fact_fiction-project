5 The effects thus stated to have been produced upon pure and upon alloyed silver,
SZ most probably in like manner prevail in respect to go!d ; but this cannot be stated as a
= certain fact ; for, although there is much reason to suppose, that under a small or very
Z moderate pressure, the wear of gold against gold of an equal quality is uniformly in
A an inyerse ratio to the degree of ductility, and allowing that under such circum-

Stances fine gold would suffer a less diminution than gold which is alloyed, yet the
present experiments proye, that under a considerable pressure, the order of wear is
in some measure different ; for, extremely soft or fine gold is then found to suffer as
great, or indeed a greater diminution, than gold which is but moderately ductile :
j and the whole of the experiments which have been made for the purpose of the present
| investigation, concur to show, that gold which is neither extremely soft nor extremely
| hard, is best adapted to resist friction in general.

186 Mr. HatcnerrT's Experiments on the various Alloys,

Just capable of being rolled and stamped, seems to be equally
improper for the purpose of coin. For, even supposing that hard
gold suffered, in every case, less by friction than that which is mo-
derately ductile, (which is not however the fact,) and allowing
that standard gold may, by a mixed alloy, be rendered as hard
as gold reduced by copper to 18 carats, without changing the
standard proportion of gold, yet it would be very difficult always
to make such standard gold of an uniform degree of hardness.
