Specific volume of the vapour when under various pressures

An examination of the equation will show that the following data are required :—

(1) The densities of solutions of different concentrations at the temperature at
which the work was carried out, namely, 0° C.

(2) A series of measurements of the relative lowering of the vapour pressures of the
solutions at 0° C.

(8) A corresponding series of measurements of the direct osmotic equilibrium
pressures for the purpose of comparison with those to be deduced from the
measurements of (2) by means of the equation.

(4) Measurements of the compressibilities of the solutions and of water.

(5) A knowledge of the change in the specific volume of water vapour with
pressure—this knowledge we assume is given by ReGgnautt’s work. Choice of Solute. Owing to the fact that, in the direct measurement of osmotic pressures, the copper
ferrocyanide membrane is semipermeable to but few substances, the choice is strictly
limited. In calcium ferrocyanide a substance was found which seemed likely to throw
considerable light on osmotic phenomena. Aqueous solutions of this substance have the following properties :—The copper
ferrocyanide membrane is practically impermeable to the salt.
