This activity, however, was very slight, and in no way
approached that seen after wounding. As the structure of each cancer varied so greatly from healthy to dead tissue, it followed
that there were also marked local variations in the rate of cell division. The difficulties
which this fact presented to a comparative study of mitotic activity were overcome by
surveying the whole structure of each cancer sectioned, and choosing the most healthy
and mitotically active regions within it. The mitosis counts, recorded below, were then
made exclusively in these active regions on unit section areas of 0-01 sq.mm. The figures
obtained in this way show that the rate of cell division bore no relationship to the oestrous
cycle.
