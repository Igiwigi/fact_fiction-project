separated from the population state; the coefficients b, c and
d reflect how fitness depends on trait values, and nothing
else, while the different ‘variances’ and ‘covariances’ only
reflect relevant properties of population states. In the Price
equation, on the other hand, 8 will have to depend on every-
thing; if the real model at hand is model B, C or D, for
instance, £ cannot be a constant, and will have to vary with
the population state. That means that there is not really a

(v) The Price equation

The two aspects of the Price equation that are usually
appreciated the most are its generality, and the fact that it is
a tautology. We will, therefore, write the change in frequency,
but this time without assuming anything about how fitness w
relates to p. This is also what is usually done, including in the
original papers by Price [1,5].
