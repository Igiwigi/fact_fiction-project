have been able to detect any peculiarities in the functions of these primitive ganglionic
tissues which have not hitherto been detected in the ganglionic tissues of higher animals,
I cannot but consider it legitimate to attach a high degree of theoretical importance to
snch peculiarities ; for I think it then becomes legitimate to feel that 8nch peculiarities
ground a strong analogy in favour of the belief, that whether or not similar functions
admit of being experimentally proved in ganglionic tissues elsewhere, such functions
are probably present wherever ganglionic action can be shown to occur, and that
however hopelessly these functions may be obscured by the new and complex relations
that in other cases are involved, they nevertheless constitute in every case 80me among
the fundamental properties of ganglionic tissue.

Now, viewed in this manner, I think that the strietly rhythmic action of the
paralyzed swimming-bell of Aurelia in answer to constant stimulation is a fact of the
highest significance ; for here we have a tissue wholly, or almost wholly, deprived of
its centres of spontaneity, yet pulsating as rhythmically in answer to artificial stimula-
tion as it previously did in answer to ganglionic stimulation.* Does not this tend to
show that for the production of the natural rhythm the presence of the ganglionic
element is non-essential ; that if we merely suppose the function of this element to be
that of supplying a coustant stimulus of a low intensity without in addition supposing
the presence of any special resistance mechanism to regulate the discharges, the
periodic sequence of systole and diastole would assuredly result ; and, therefore, that
the rhythmical character of the natural swimming motions is dependent, not on the
peculiar relations of the 'ganglionic, but on the primary qualities of the contractile
tissne ? Or, if we do not go 80 far as this (and, as I shall conclude by explaining, I
am not myself inclined to go 80 far), musb we not at least conclude that the natural
