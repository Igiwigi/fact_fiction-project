the examination of which will show that we have for the quartic the following
irreducihle covariants, viz. the quartic itself U ; an invariant of the degree 2, which I
represent by I ; a covariant of the order 4 and of the degree 2, which I represent by H ;
an invariant of the degree 3, which I represent by J; and a coyariant of the order 6
and the degree 3, which I represent by Þ; but that the irreducible covariants are
connected by an equation of the degree 6, viz. there is a linear equation or syzygy
between ?, I'H*, PJH*U, IJ*HU*? and J*U?; this is in fact the complete system of
the irreducible covariants of the quartic: the only irreducible invariants are the
invariants I, J.
