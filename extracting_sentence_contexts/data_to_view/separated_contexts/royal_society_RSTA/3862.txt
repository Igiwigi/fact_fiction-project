In Trinidad the
Milne seismograph in the Botanic Gardens has shown none but small disturbances. * In Montserrat, since the year 1896, earthquakes have been very frequent; in
fact, it is said that they have been of almost daily occurrence, and in some cases as
many as 100 have been counted in one day.t It is apparently a matter of indifference which of the volcanoes of the chain is in
operation ; one appears to be able to function in place of the others. The previous
eruptions of the Soufriére and Montagne Pelée did not coincide in point of time, and
that both have this year been in violent action further proves the unusual magnitude
of the changes in progress in that part of the earth’s crust.
