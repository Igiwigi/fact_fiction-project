being subdivided into points of space and particles of matter. The essential relation
has for its field the points of space only. Slight variants (not considered here) can
be given to the concept by varying the properties of the essential relation, so as to
make the geometry non-Euclidean, or, retaining Euclidean geometry, so as to give
various forms to the essential relation and the resulting axioms. In the exposition of
a system of geometrical axioms for Concept I., VEBLEN’s memoir (ef. loc. cit.), to
which I am largely indebted, will be followed. The changes which are made from
VeBLEN’s treatment are (i) in the addition of the symbolism which emphasizes the
idea of the essential relation, and (ii) in the fact that the question of the independence
of axioms is here ignored, through a desire not to overload this memoir with
difficulties (both for the author and reader) belonging to another part of the subject.
As the result of (ii), some of VEBLEN’s definitions and axioms have been simplified
(and, in a sense, spoiled). The axioms thus obtained for Concept I. will shorten our
investigations of other concepts by serving as a standard of comparison to determine
whether the axioms of the other concepts are sufficient to yield three-dimensional
Euclidean geometry.*

The essential relation (called R) is triadic. R*(abe) means the points a, b, ¢ are in
the linear order (or the R-order) abe. The relation R, when Ri(abe) holds, is not
symmetrical as between the three points a, b, and c; namely, it will be found that a@
and b (or > and ¢) cannot be interchanged.
