Studying serpentinization on
these other worlds may yield insights into the limits and nature of serpentinization on Earth. This planetary perspective on Earth’s serpentinization echoes the way in which the field of
astrobiology seeks to use planetary exploration to test hypotheses for life’s origin. In fact, the
two investigations are connected. Some hypotheses for life’s origin invoke serpentinization as providing the template for
early metabolism that was the fundamental drive for life, with gene encoding and replication
evolving subsequently or perhaps contemporaneously [13-16]. However, it should be noted
that many seemingly viable and sometimes contradictory hypotheses for life’s origin are being
investigated [17], and problems with the ‘metabolism first’ hypothesis have been suggested.
