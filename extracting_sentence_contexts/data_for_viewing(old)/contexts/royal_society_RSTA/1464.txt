6. Life in a finite world: too much data is like no data PS

Finally, there is an argument that hinges directly on epistemology and society, since it has to do
with a most prized human attribute: wisdom, the ability to take the right decision. Wisdom is : a
often represented as the top level of a pyramid of four, the DIKW (data-information-knowledge- 2
wisdom) chain, the one enabling us to take well-informed decisions. From data we extract ;
information, from information we extract knowledge and finally from knowledge we distil the
ultimate goal: Wisdom, the ability to do the ‘right thing’ (figure 4).

BD-driven decision theory is obviously of paramount importance to science, business and
society, as it is to each of our private lives. But, as a matter of fact, the ‘constitutive relation’
between Data and Information, Information versus Knowledge and Knowledge versus Wisdom is
not well known, to put it mildly. In the following, we shall argue that the pyramid representation
is deceptive, for it conveys the idea that the layers stand in a simple linear relationship to one
another, which is by no means the case. More importantly, it suggests that by expanding the
basis (data) all upper-lying layers will expand accordingly, whence the mantra: more data, more
wisdom.

This flies in the face of a very general fact of life: sooner or later, all finite systems hit their
ceiling, the technical name of the game being nonlinear saturation, another well-known concept
in the science of complex systems. This is the very general competition-driven phenomenon by
which increasing data supply leads to saturation and sometimes even loss of information; adding
further data actually destroys information.
