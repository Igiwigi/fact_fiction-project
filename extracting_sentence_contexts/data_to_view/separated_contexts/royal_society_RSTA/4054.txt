Upon calculating the residual stresses at the lamina level, a reverse
micromechanics approach [19] can be employed to calculate average phase level stresses. However, there are issues with the above-mentioned traditional approach. One main
drawback is that stress development, in fact, initiates pre-gelation [42-44]. Early in the cure cycle
when the resin is essentially a viscous fluid, interaction of tool and wavy fibre bed may result in
appreciable stress development [42]. This effect is intensified by the mismatch of thermal strains
(ie.
