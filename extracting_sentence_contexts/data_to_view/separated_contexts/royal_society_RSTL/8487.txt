7071 feet than at Darjeeling at 6941 feet. Calling the annual mean density of
atmospheric column below the hill-station in each case =1, the range between Jan
and July is 0-048 in Bengal, and 0:058 in the North-western Provinces. If the method of computation which gives the values d, be accepted as legitimate,
varying successvely the values of each of the terms (b,+0,), (4,+t,), and (6, +e,) in
formula for 4, while the others remain constant, we may ascertain another fact of hi
importance, viz. the degree in which the density of this column is affected respectiyel:
by the variation of the top pressure, the rise of temperature, and the introduction
additional vapour in the place of dry air of the same pressure. Between January and
July the mean density of the air below Darjecling falls from 0-837 to 0:798.
