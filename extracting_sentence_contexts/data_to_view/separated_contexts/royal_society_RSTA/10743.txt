In
solubilities, however, the largest difference is ‘06 at 75° C., and this corresponds to

an error of 0°16 per cent. This large difference in the two percentage errors is
remarkable, and I have not yet been able to account for it—it is manifested in most
of the salts hitherto worked with. A fact which may possibly throw light on the
subject is noticeable in the above table, and is one which most of the salts also show,
namely, that the solubilities obtained when
starting with an unsaturated solution, tend to
be slightly less than those obtained when
