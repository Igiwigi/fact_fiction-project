Crete.—From M. Victor Ravuin’s work on Crete* I gather that there is evidence
of the elevation of the island within the historical period to the extent of 15 to 25 feet,
and further, that at a height of about 65 feet, a Raised Beach of Quaternary age is met
with at many points of the coast. In the absence of sections and exact details, we
can only surmise that the Rubble-drift is present there from the mention of two facts—
(1) that at one place the Raised Beach is overlaid by a calcareous breccia (bréche cal-
caire) or “ Head ;” and (2) that at the foot of the great escarpments of the interior there
are immense accumulations of angular detritus. Some of these (terrains détritiques)
are recent, but some seem more widespread and older. They are traceable up to
heights of 200 to 300 metres.
