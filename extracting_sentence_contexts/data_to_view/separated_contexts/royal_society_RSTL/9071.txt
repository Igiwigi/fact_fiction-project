The figure, except in outline and the position of the apex, gives but a poor idea
of this beautifully sculptured Patella. Tt represents the number of ribs at about
forty, whereas there are usually about sixty. The specimens from Kerguelen's
Island are a trifle narrower and much more depressed than examples from the
Falkland Islands ; in fact, it is only near the apex that they are at all raised, and
towards the margin they are up-turned, s0 that the dorsal surface is concave, and
this form of the shell certainly prevents the animal from entirely concealing itself
when adhering to a flat surface. But this peculiarity of form only exists in adult
8pecimens, for seyeral small ones are like ordinary species in this respect. The
radiating ribs are almost obsolete in the flat examples, but the undulating concentric
lirations, which are more prominent ' and farther apart than in the type form of
the species, define their position ; in young shells they are more pronounced.
