DR. A. FARRE ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE CILIOBRACHIATE POLYPI. 411

dozen to twenty cilia are concerned in the production of each apparent wave, the
highest point of which is formed bya cilium extended to its full length, and the lowest
point between every two waves by one folded down completely upon itself, the inter-
vening space being completed by others in every degree of extension, s0 as to present
something of the outline of a cone. (And it is remarkable that one of these corre-
sponds very nearly in breadth with one of the supposed muscular lobes.) As, how-
ever, the persistence of each cilium in any one of these positions is only of the shortest
possible duration, and each takes up in regular snccession the action of the adjoining
one, 80 that cilium, which by being completely folded up formed the lowest point be-
tween any two waves, now in its turn by its complete extension forms the highest
point of a wave; and thus while the cilia are alternately bending and unbending them-
selyes, each in regular succession after the other, the waves only travel onward, whilst
the cilia never change their position in this direction, having in fact no lateral motion. When the waves travel very rapidly they appear smooth on one side and fringed on
the other (fig. 23.). The whole of the ciliary motions are s0 evidently under the
entire control of the animal as to leave not the slightest doubt in the mind of the
observer as to this point.
