The saline particles of which this efflorescence consisted I at
first supposed to be nitrate of lead ; but upon examination in
various ways no trace of lead could be found in them, and
they exhibited the principal characters of common nitre : they
deflagrated, for instance, with charcoal, leaving a deliquescent
alkaline residuum. Many weeks have elapsed since that saline
efflorescence was brushed off, but I have not yet observed any
renewal of it. Though the production of saltpetre had been pointed out to
me in the laboratory of the Ashmole Museum as long since
as the year 1802, I was prevented by many circumstances
from observing with any degree of regularity or precision


the natural production of Salthetre. 513

the phenomena of this natural process previously to the
commencement of last year: about which time having care-
fully brushed away the whole of the saline efflorescence from
a part of the north wall situated below the level of the street,
and very imperfectly exposed to the light, I was surprised by
the fact of its quick reappearance. It was brushed away at
the end of January, but within three days it had again efflo-
resced in sufficient quantity to present that appearance of hoar
frost, or down, or mould, which is very characteristic of the
manner in which naturally formed saltpetre is often accumu-
lated; and which a person, utterly incapable of judging of the
real nature of the substance, described at the time by the term
« damp.”

I was till more surprised, however, in observing aſter a
few days, that the quantity of the saltpetre was apparently
very much diminished ; and that at the end of eight or ten
days there was scarcely any appearance of it-remaining :
though there was no reason to suppose a particle. had either
accidentally fallen to the/ground or been intentionally removed. The same part of the wall was again brushed perfectly
clean, and I continued. to make daily observations in expecta-
tion of a renewal of the-process ; but no new collection was
perceptible, excepting in the form of a very few detached and
minute capillary crystals, till the 16th of March: on which
day, having been absent during the whole of the 14th and
15th, I found a more abundant accumulation than in the pre-
ceding insta1ices,

It was an obvious supposition that the reproduction of the
nitre was connected with some change in the $tate of the at-
mosphere: and it is to be remarked, that its first mentioned
