AY memoir of M. Humzeren, + Sur quelques th6oremes Ualgobre et la resolution de
Vequation du quatrieme degre,” * contains a very important theorem in relation to
TSCHIRNHAUSEN'S Transformation of an equation F(x) =0 into another of the same degree
in y, by means of the substitution y=$2, where $x is a rational and integral function
of x. In fact, considering for greater simplicity a quartic equation,
(a, b, e, d, eXx, 1)'=0,
M. Hrrare gives to the equation y=$z the following form,
y=aT+(ar+b)B+(aa*+4bx+6c)C+(aa* +4ba*+6ex+44)D
(T write B, C, D in the place of his T,, T,, T,), and he shows that the transformed equa-
tion in y has the following property : viz., every function of the coefficients which,
expressed as a function of a, b, c, d, e, T, B, C, D, does not contain 'T, is an invariant,
that is, an invariant of the two quantics
(a, b, e, d, eXX, Y)\, (B, C, DYY, —XY. This comes to saying that if T be s0-determined that in the equation for y the coeffi-
cient of the second term (*) shall yanish, the other coefficients will be invariants; or it,
in the function of y which is equated to zero, we consider y as an absolute constant, the
function of y will be an invariant of the two quantics.
