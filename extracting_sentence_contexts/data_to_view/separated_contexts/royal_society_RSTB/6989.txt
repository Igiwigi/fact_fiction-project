One of the most interesting points about this nervous system is the absence of a nerve
of any size to the adductor muscleâ€”a muscle far and away the largest in the body. I have
had to exaggerate the size of the nerve supply in figure 17. The nerve is, in fact, no larger
than one of the minute nerves which can be traced from the visceral system to the small
dilator muscles of the oesophagus. It consists of only two or three fibres at the most. It clearly cannot be a normal motor supply.
