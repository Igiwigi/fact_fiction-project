The latter amplitude is probably necessary for hand signalling, but our experiments
have shown that less than 1 per cent. is sufficient when a proper compensation is made. The coincidence between theory and observation places it beyond doubt that the curve
truly expresses the relation between the speeds and amplitudes for straight as well as
for coiled'cables; and if the amplitude at any one speed through any one straight cable
were known, the amplitude at any other speed through any other cable of the same
Sh materials might be calculated from the curve with certainty ; but unfortunately this
a fact is wanting. There is no proof that the absolute amplitude observed through the
5 coiled cable would remain unaltered if the cable were extended; on the contrary, it is
Z very generally believed that it is easier to signal through a straight than a coiled cable ; = and if this be 80, the amplitude would increase as the cable was laid.
