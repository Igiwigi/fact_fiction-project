and Lypaut,* in which B as well as dB/dt has been determined as a function of ¢ in

a ring submitted to alternating magnetic forces—exemplify how wide the variation
from a sine-function is likely to be. In view of this consideration, and of the fact
that no such data were at hand in the case of our own tests, we have not followed
up this method of directly measuring the heat produced by reversals. EXPERIMENTS MADE WITH THE Magnetic Curve TRACER. When the magnetism of a piece of iron is reversed rapidly more work'is spent than
when the reversal takes place slowly.
