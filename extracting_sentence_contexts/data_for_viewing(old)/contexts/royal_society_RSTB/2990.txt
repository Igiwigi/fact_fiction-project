PoLLm ation,

A majority of the sections that traverse the lower part of the pollen-chamber of
full-sized seeds afford evidence that pollination has been effected. The supposed
ovule (U. C. L., R. 13, fig. 34), and the small arrested specimens, on the other hand,
contain no pollen.

Nevertheless these young seeds were already provided with pollen-chambers of full
size and mature appearance, whilst the orifice, also, projected well beyond the canopy
(phot. 2 and fig. 24, p.câ€™.).

These facts are consistent with the view that pollen was received by the seed
while it was still fairly small; as soon, perhaps, as the unfolding of the cupule at the
apex permitted. Nevertheless we hardly possess sufticient data for arriving at a
decision as to the time of pollination. The little seeds seem ready for the pollen, but
only full-sized specimens are known to contain pollen in the pollen-chambers. The
reason, too, for the abortion of the small-sized seeds remains obscure. In view of

what is known to happen in the case of Cycads, it would be imprudent to conclude
that abortion occurred from lack of pollination.
