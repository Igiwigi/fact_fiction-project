Nevertheless, it plays a dominant role. In the usual cases where the crack speed is higher than
that of the projectile, a conical crack propagates ahead of the latter, and the resistance drops when
the crack reaches the rear surface. Taking this fact into account, I determined the size effect: the
perforated thickness is proportional to the projectile diameter of power 4/3. This result had a
substantial impact on some applications. Another size effect, with the exponent 13/8, was found for the force action on sea ice [26].
