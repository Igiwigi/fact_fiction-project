therefore, notwithstanding some differences in the condition of the bones, which may
accounted for perhaps by their different positions, to think that the fragment of jaw
the astragalus may have belonged, if not to the same individual, yet to one of the same
8ize or breed. What relation this bone has to the horns and bones which lay at
greater depth TI am unable to say.
