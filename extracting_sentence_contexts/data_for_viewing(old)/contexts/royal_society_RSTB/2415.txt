clusion supported by sections through sporangia with rounded-off spore-mother-cells,
for these indicate such a number as 32 (fig. 52).

Observations were also made on Aneimia phyllitidis, the countings resulting in 114,
104, 111, numbers which tally with Mohria, and also with Prantrâ€™s (fig. 121). It
may be added that numerous sections of developing sporangia bear out the conclusion
that the typical number of spore-mother-cells in Aneimia is 32. The sporangia of
Trochopteris (Aneimia) elegans also contain a larger number of spores than 64, but
actual enumerations were not made on this rare Fern.

Thus all the observed genera of Schizeeaceze have a larger number of spores per
sporangium than the ordinary Leptosporangiate Ferns. The largest sporangia are
those of Lygodium, and they have the largest output. The fact that Lygodium
exceeds the other genera is interesting, as it is the genus specially selected by
ZeILLER, on other grounds, for comparison with Senftenbergia, one of the oldest
known Fern types.

In its anatomy, also, Lygodiwm stands aloof from Aneimia and Mohria, and shows
characters more nearly comparable with Gleichenia,

As regards dehiscence, the Schizeeaceze resemble the Gleicheniaceze and Osmundacez ;
they require room laterally for successful dehiscence, a method suitable only for laxly
grouped sporangia.
