of oscillatory BZ gels, pioneered by Yoshida [6], in which the BZ dynamics drive the remarkable 22
chemomechanical behaviours observed, with the systems studied by Boissonade [7] and Horvath [4

In this paper, we explore whether extremely simple chemistry, ic. adsorption and desorption :3

of a single chemical species onto a porous solid whose porosity varies nonlinearly with surface
coverage, can result in oscillations. In our treatment, only one reversible elementary chemical
reaction step is involved, and complicated chemical feedbacks such as those encountered in
the BZ reaction are excluded. We develop and analyse a two-variable model for such a system,
which one might dub the ‘poroscillator’, and demonstrate that oscillations can in fact arise under
appropriate conditions. We first describe the elements of the model and the corresponding set of
rate equations in a rather general way. This allows us to derive the broad conditions under which
the model might allow oscillations. We then turn to the specific case of Langmuir kinetics subject
to different functional dependences of the porosity on the surface coverage. We use our theory to
prove that while linear porosity functions are unable to destabilize the steady state, nonlinear
porosities can indeed produce oscillations under appropriate conditions. We numerically test
these last results by choosing a sigmoidal porosity function.

2. Theory in terms of surface concentration

Let us consider a system where a solid porous matrix of volume V, is continuously and uniformly
in contact with a gas phase of volume Vg. We assume that the gas phase contains a reactive
