M~10!! (ans) Mo (solar masses). (2.23)
This relation represents the mass-velocity dispersion relation of elliptical galaxies (dashed line
in figure 2a); this is obtained from their luminosity—velocity dispersion relation (the so-called
Faber-Jackson relation; figure 2a solid line)—after correction for the galaxy mass-to-light ratio
normalized to the solar values M/L ~ 6 x Mo/Lo.

It is of interest to note that similar relations occur in other astrophysical settings. One of them,
associated with galactic molecular clouds, has been known for some time [16] as the Larson
Relation (figure 2b). A little known (or perhaps tacitly ignored) fact is that this latter relation
(dashed line of figure 2b) extrapolates into the Faber—Jackson relation (dashed line of figure 2a) ina
unifying mass-velocity relation that spans 11 decades in mass, signifying an underlying common
physical reason. As such, we note, in agreement with arguments above, that all these classes of
objects have approximately the same column density, which is also the column density of the
Universe and incidentally that of the electron! These regularities, which span many orders of
magnitude in scale, imply a common origin of these facts; while this may or may not be attributed
to Weyl gravity, the presence of the characteristic column density given in equation (2.6), obtained
first in the exact solution of this theory, does not appear accidental.

The exact metric form of equation (2.4) incites the computation of gravitational lensing in
