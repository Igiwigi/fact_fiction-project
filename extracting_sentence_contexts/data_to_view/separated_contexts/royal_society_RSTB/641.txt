In these certain nerve roots were divided under the
influence of an anesthetic, and with antiseptic precautions. The animal was in each
instance allowed to live for three weeks, and then killed. In order to prevent tedious
repetition, it will suffice to say that microscopic examination showed that these
experiments confirmed the anatomical facts that had been previously ascertained, as
degeneration following section of a root was found only in those nerves which had
been shown to have their origin from it. For example, division of the sixth root was
followed by degeneration in the musculo-cutaneous, thus proving that this nerve does
receive fibres from the sixth root in some cases; so, too, the musculo-spiral, about the
origin of which there are discrepancies in the statements of different observers, was
found to have some of its fibres degenerated after division of the seventh root. Another point of interest in connection with this root was the degeneration found in
the median nerve after division of the root in question.
