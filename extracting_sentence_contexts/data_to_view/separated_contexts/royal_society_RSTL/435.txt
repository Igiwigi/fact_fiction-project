CueNEvix's Analysis of Corundum, and of

Darracg has published a paper, intended as a refutation of the
conclusions drawn by GuyTon. I had myself repeated the greater
part of the experiments of the latter; and the results I ob-
tained were exactly similar to those of Darracg. In fact, I
had intended to continue the researches; but the very satisfac-
tory paper of DarRacg, appeared to me to render a further
prosecution of them totally useless. However, a paragraph
inserted in the .Annales de Chimie, (Tom. XLI. p. 206.) and
of which GuyTox appears to be the author, shows that he
has not derived from the Memoir of DarRaco, that conviction
which it certainly conveys.
