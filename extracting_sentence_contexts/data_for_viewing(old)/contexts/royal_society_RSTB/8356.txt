“fundamental” part of it [81]. That is, the properties of
a system depend as much on the component parts as
on their organization.

By reuniting the qualities of form and behaviour
outlined above, one may recognize that ‘behaviour’—
in its broader definition—is in fact the way in which
parts composing a specific level of the hierarchy func-
tion, their organization. The parts so organized (i.e.
behaving in a certain way) acquire and have a specific
‘form’ and so a function. This perspective applies to
any level of the biological hierarchy (figure 2). Parts
at the ‘behavioural level’ may be body parts that, orga-
nized (i.e. moving, behaving) in a specific way, achieve
a certain function; parts at a lower level may be amino
acids in a protein that, organized in a determined way (b) Evo-devo on behaviour: comparing levels
