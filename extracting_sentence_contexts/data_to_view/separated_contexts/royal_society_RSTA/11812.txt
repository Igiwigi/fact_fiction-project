The latter part is the magnetic force, in the ordinary phraseology, and
is clearly only this part whose tangential component must be continuous, when we
poss an interface into a region in which the distribution of the magnetic molecular
rtices is different.

It is a check on the averaged form of the dynamical equations fora material mediu
that these six interfacial conditions regarding force and flux should be consistent wit!
the incompressibility of the ether ; and in fact the relations given above show th
only four of the six are independent. It is on this account, for example, that the
general requirements of the problem of physical optics are satisfied. Molecular Current Systems replaced by Equivalent Continuous Currents.
