They were thrown into greater confusion when hit by a gust than
lower fliers hit by the same gust, resisted being drifted backwards less tenaciously and turned
down-wind less quickly when being carried backwards. After a gust had passed, higher
fliers did not return to up-wind orientation as rapidly as lower fliers. Since, in spite of the
fact that wind speeds are greater aloft, away from the frictional drag of the ground, higher
fliers were nevertheless less responsive than lower ones when hit by the same gust, it was con-
cluded that markedly stronger winds were required to evoke responses from the higher fliers. The behaviour of fledgling and sexually active locusts, classified as ‘semi-migrants’
(p. 173), in wind, was in principle the same as that of full migrants, with the important
difference that the wind speed causing them to lose headway, turn down-wind and settle
was decidedly lower than for full migrants. The same general pattern of behaviour in wind, whether of full migrants or semi-
migrants, was characteristic of single, isolated fliers and not merely of dense swarms.
