difference will yary when determined by means of each pair of barometric observa-
tions, the standard yalue 6836 being the mean of a very considerable number, Now
it is very evident that were it not for that term in the formula which involves the
correction for the expansion of the air, the sum of the above values would give the
difference of altitude, however erroneous the intermediate observation might be: for
calling b', b” and 5” the three boiling-points, we should have

548(b'—Þ)—24D +548(b"—6")+24D=548(5'—8"),
The observation, therefore, of the external temperature at the intermediate station
becomes the means of rendering the accordance of the sums of the component alti-
tudes with the whole height between Geneva and the Great St. Bernard, as deter-
mined in each case, a test of the correctness of the observation of the boiling tempe-
rature. We may in fact, by equating the formula for the whole height with the sum

* All who have traversed the Pass of the Bonhomme are aware that in crossing to the south, upon Chapiu,
the tract rises considerably after passing what ought to be and, I believe, is considered the ** Col,” viz. the point
from which a view of the mountains of the Turentaise is first obtained ; this point is marked by a cross, larger
than usual on most passes, and than any of the numerous others on this pass, This cross I believe to be the
« Croix du Bonhomme” of Dz Savssurs, and it was at its base the observation above referred to was made,
