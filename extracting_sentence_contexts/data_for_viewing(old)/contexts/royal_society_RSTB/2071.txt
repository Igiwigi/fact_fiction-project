internal band of sclerenchyma. In the upper third of the specimen this leaf-base is
much flattened, and forms the greater part of the exposed outer surface.

The leaf-base b (which, of course, is not seen in surface view, as it lies on the
embedded side of the specimen) is marked off by internal sclerenchyma at the level 3,
and at the top of the specimen has become free, but is here only represented by some
shreds of tissue. Although large free petioles of Myeloaylon occur in the surrounding
matrix, they have not so far been followed to their connection with the stem in this
specimen, but in the case of one free petiole of Specimen I. the connection has been
traced. The petioles usually appear to have been torn from their bases ; there is no
sign of a regular abscission. At the level 3, in Specimen IJ., another new leaf-base
(ab) makes its appearance between a and b. It will be seen from this specimen that
the leaves were spirally arranged; the facts agree well with a 2/5 phyllotaxis (see
diagram, p. 126). The leaf-bases were evidently adherent to the stem for a long
distance. That marked « can be traced with certainty for more than five inches
before it detaches itself from the stem. In this length only two leaves become free,
namely, ¢, in the lower part, and 6 near the top. The vertical distance between
successive leaves may be roughly estimated at about four inches.

Judging from this specimen, there was but little free surface of the stem between
the prominent bases of the leaves. The other specimens are less favourable for
