In another experiment, evidence of the constitution of the periodides was obtained. The apparatus shown in fig. 1 was filled with a 0°5 N solution of potassium iodide
containing iodine, the indicators being sodium acetate and lithium chloride. At the cathode end, where the “ Na boundary was formed, a precipitation ot

iodine occurred, doubtless on account of the fact that the I, ion being slower than the
Lion, some of the former would be left behind in a portion of the system, where
the equilibrium between KI, I,, and KI, was disturbed, and therefore nearly the
whole of the iodine was thrown out of the solution. The existence of complex
I, ions is conclusively proved by the behaviour of the solution at the anode end;

here a = I margin travels away from the gelatine solution of lithium chloride, and

simultaneously the I ions enter the latter, forming lithium iodide, but not only I ions
enter the jelly, but I; also, and the jelly for a length of about 1 centim. becomes
coloured a deep red by the solution of Lil, that is produced. The entrance of the
iodine is far too rapid to be explained by diffusion, and a blank experiment that was
carried out showed that in the same time the distance covered by diffusion of the
iodine amounted to only about 1 millim., and showed no such sharp line of
demareation between the coloured and colourless portions of the system.
