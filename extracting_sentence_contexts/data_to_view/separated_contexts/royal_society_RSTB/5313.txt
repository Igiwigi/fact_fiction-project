(text-fig. 30, d). It seems probable that the explanation

of the difference between the two specimens lies in the fact that in the one case
we are dealing with fully developed examples whilst in the other they are immature. In both they form a dense thatch, the apical parts of the lower ones overlapping the bases
of those higher up the petiole (Plate 10, fig. 35). In addition to the specialised hairs the
Kidston specimen has an investment of what are undoubtedly rather flattened aphlebiz,
which appear to have functioned in the manner of bud scales, and which bore upon their
basal parts a felted mass of fine branching hairs identical in type with those occurring
on the aphlebiz at lower levels (Plate 10, fig.
