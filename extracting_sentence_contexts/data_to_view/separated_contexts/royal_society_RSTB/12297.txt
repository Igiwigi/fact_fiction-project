Nowadays, modern human
beings increasingly rely on vision, with the result that we are losing active olfactory
genes at a greater rate than all other primates [1,2]. It is interesting to speculate
whether vestiges of the evolutionary development of our sense of smell can be
ascertained today. The fact that a newborn baby uses smell to turn towards its
motherâ€™s breast suggests that there is an inbuilt genetic coding for chemical detec-
tion [3]. On the other hand, the sense of smell is strongly linked to the neurobiology
of memory, suggesting past personal experience is also an important factor in smell
perception [4]. Finally, in the instant of smelling, our olfactory system reacts rapidly,
desensitizing us to strong or persistent odours so as to retain detection capability
[5].
