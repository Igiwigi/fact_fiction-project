grain size in standard granular theory [95]. A series of sea ice rheologies, for example [96] or [69],
have been built to incorporate information about floe size (or an equivalent measure). The fracture
of sea ice by waves may then influence the drift of sea ice in the MIZ. Sea ice floe sizes also play an
important role in the transmission of momentum to the upper ocean, and the effect of floe sizes on
ocean drag has been included in parameterizations of form drag [66,97,98]. Efforts are underway
to understand how the FSD influences momentum transfer, sea ice rheology, and subsequent
sea ice evolution in MIZs, which may have a pronounced impact on overall sea ice coverage.
For example: in [17], sea ice drift can be substantially altered in the aftermath of energetic wave
events. In [99], FSD-influenced granular mechanics are shown to play an important role in setting
the width and variability of the MIZ.

More highly broken floes permit higher contact between the ice and the ocean, by the simple
fact that they move independently, revealing small patches of open water. These small regions
reduce total sea ice concentration and permit more sunlight. More floe-like systems, for example,
in the Southern Ocean, may permit significant amounts of sunlight to reach through them
in summer. This in turn could seed phytoplankton blooms underneath sea ice [100]. Indeed,
fractured, thick sea ice was found to support phytoplankton blooms [101] in May-June, months
before seasonal sea ice retreat, and lateral variability in light conditions plays an important role
in driving the availability of sunlight in the upper ocean [6,102,103]. In the Southern Ocean, the
floe-like mosaic that extends across the sea ice zone has a lower concentration than the Arctic,


which may permit phytoplankton growth under sea ice throughout the spring and summer that
is challenging to observe remotely [75,104].
