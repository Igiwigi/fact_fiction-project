step. Its performance is strongly associated with the methods and the convergent factors used
in iterative minimization process as given by equation (2.16). The typical examples are the use of
NR optimization [16], Tikhonov regularization method [19,20] with the techniques of selection of
regularization factors such as the singular value decomposition method and Akaike’s information
criterion [21] and the Marquardt method [22].
The error function is

r= TATAx— TA'b. (2.16)

(iii) One-step methods

One-step method refers the solution from the iterations at the end of the first step of a multi-
step method. It is the fact that the result from the first-step solution normally provides the
most contributive convergence if the regularization factors are properly selected. The quality of
resultant images is generally much better than those came from back-projection approximation
as results from NOSER method [15] and the SCG method [10]. It also runs at a much fast speed
than that of multi-step method owing to the use of the pre-calculated sensitivity matrix. An
iterative solution can be obtained in a kind of the Landweber iteration method as expressed by
