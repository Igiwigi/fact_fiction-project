the results being necessarily the same in both cases. The deficiency of the actual reult
is not great, and is on the side of the probable error, in consequence of the unavoidable
loss of a portion of the thermal effect by conduction from the junction.

126. Thus even in the above delicate case is the formula of Professor TnowsoN com-
pletely verified. The mathematical investigation of the thermo-elastic qualities of
metals has enabled my illustrious friend to predict with certainty a whole class of highly
interesting phenomena. To him especially do we owe the important advance which has
been recently made to a new era in the history of science, when the famous philoso-
phical system of Bacoy will be to a great extent superseded, and when, instead of
arriving at discovery by induction from experiment, we shall obtain our largest acces-
Sions of new facts by reasoning deductively from fundamental principles.
