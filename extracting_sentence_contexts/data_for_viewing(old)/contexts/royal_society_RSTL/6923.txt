about” 49; feet, with a kind of flate-ſtone, rough-
caſted on the outfide ; upon which is formed a very
elegant oCtogon Gothic lanthorn about 9 feet high,
; and thereon a ſtone ſpire about 52 feet height, with
a ſpindle and yane rifing about z feet above the tone:
ſo that the whole together was about 114 feet. Each
face of the lanthorn finiſhes above with a fort of a
Gothic pediment, with a little pinacle upon each,
ſeparated from the body of the ſpire.

I will not affirm, that the lightning entered in at
: the/ſpindle or vane at top; but will ſuppoſe it, for
the fake of methodizing the facts. The vane was
of plate copper, which being turned round, and
fivetted, made a ſocket to turn upon. The ſpindle
did not reach thro' the ſocket, but the weight of
the vane reſted upon the top of the ſpindle, the top
of the ſocket being cloſed. About the vane were
many acute angles, and ſome almoſt ſharp ; but 1 did
not obſerve any pointing direQly upward. The vane
was much bruiſed, which might be occaſioned by
the fall ; but the ſocket was rent open, as if it had
been burſt by gunpowder ; and in ſuch a-manner,
as I cannot-conceive-could be occafioned by the fall.
