vol. 13, pp. 126-132). The marked influence on the rotatory power of tartaric acid of
dilution with water or of addition of boric acid was therefore attributed to chemical
changes just as definite as those involved in the conversion of the acid into its salts,
This early view, which had fallen into disrepute for many years, has now become promi-
nent again, more especially as an explanation of variations of rotatory power in those
cases of anomalous rotatory dispersion of which tartaric acid is still the chief type.

(6) Normal and Anomalous Rotatory Dispersion.}

Only a short time elapsed before Bior’s law of inverse squares was recognised as
being inexact. Bror had suspected almost from the first that small variations of dis-
persive power might exist in different compounds ; in 1836 he obtained clear evidence
of this fact by balancing against one another columns of turpentine and of oil of lemon
which produced approximately equal and opposite rotations, when he found that “ the
compensation of the deviations, although very close for all the rays, was, however,
neither complete nor general” (‘Comptes Rendus,’ 1836, vol. 2, p. 543); cane-sugar

compare * Mém. Acad. Sci.,’ 1835, vol. 13, p. 116) the rotation that would be produced by a column 1 mm.
thick and of unit density ; this is one-hundredth part of what is now called the specific rotatory power of
the substance.
