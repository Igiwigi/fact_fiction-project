43°5 inches long by 1°5 inches broad by 3 inches deep. When the channel was cut
for the first time a certain number of air holes were found in the base and lateral
faces. Experiments on a smaller trough had, however, shown that these might be
satisfactorily removed by depositing paraffin wax in a thin layer on the sides and
base of the channel, and re-cutting. This was successfully accomplished for the large
trough, and a uniform surface was secured. The channel was finished by carrying
a scraper from end to end which took a very thin cut off both faces and base. The
result of the scraping was a very smooth and highly finished surface.

It was thought that the breadth of the trough might be obtained by measuring the
width of the seraper. But they were not found to be equal when the breadth of the
trough was subsequently measured. The difference amounts to ‘006 or ‘007 inch, the
width of the scraper being the greater. This difference may be due in part to the fact
that the measurement of the trough was made at a different temperature (about 15°°5 C.)
to that at which it was cut. Unfortunately the latter temperature was not registered.

This method of obtaining a channel for the mercury was adopted in the hope that

so cut in the lathe, it might present a breadth constant to about the ten-thousandth
of an inch. This hope was not realised. The results of calibrating the trough over the
ten inches of it, used in the course of the experiments, are given in § 28. Probably
more satisfactory results might be obtained by building up the trough of worked glass
