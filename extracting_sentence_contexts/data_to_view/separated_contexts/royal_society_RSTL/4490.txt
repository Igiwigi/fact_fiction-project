Indications of the Pelorosaurus in the Oolitic strata,—The general accordance of
the terrestrial fauna and flora of the Oolitic period, (as proved by the remains of land
animals and plants imbedded in the fluvio-marine deposits of that formation,) with
those of the Cretaceous and Wealden, renders it probable that vestiges of most, if not
all, of the genera and species of land reptiles that occur in the latter will be found
in the former strata. Thus as the Iguanodon, Pterodactyles, with Clathrarizz and
Draczene, are found in the Chalk, and the Megalosaurus, with Cycadez and Conifer,
in the Wealden, traces of the Pelorosaurus may be expected to occur in the Oolite. To ascertain this fact, I availed myself of the liberal permission of my friend the
Dzan oy WesTMINsTER to examine his splendid collection, and I repaired to Oxford
and diligently inspected the numerous specimens of Saurian remains which it con-
tains, especially those from the Wealden and Oolite. To avoid prolixity I will but remark, that among immense quantities of huge ver-
tebraz and bones of the extremities of unequivocally marine Saurians, as proved by the
cancellated structure of their centres, and which had been properly referred to Plio-
saurus, Cetiosaurus, &c., there are portions of femora, vertebrz, and tarsal phalangeal
and ungueal bones, which appear to be distinct from those of any established genus. I refer especially to several caudal vertebra resembling that from Tilgate Forest
(Plate XXIII. figs. 9 and 10), which are probably of the Pelorosaurus, and large curved
claw-bones, from 4 to 6 inches long.
