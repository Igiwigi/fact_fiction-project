ments. They were firs placed in melting ice, when A read 0*18 and C, which had
Sþeen altered in order to secure greater range, 7*:65, In vacuo the zero-points of
Ahese thermometers were 0*11 and 7%10 respectively. Thus thermometer A. fell
9-07, while © fell 0*55, the difference being 0*48. This was repeated after the
xperiments described in Series II., when A placed in melting ice read 023, and ©
304 and in vacuo 0*17 and 7*13 respectively. Thus A fell 0*:06 and B 0*:59, the
Alifference being 0*53. This agrees with the comparison of the two thermometers ab
Jhe atmospheric pressure and in a vacuum. At the same time, other readings of
Fhermometer C were s8omewhat variable, and it was therefore deemed advisable to
Assume that the zero-point of C in Series IL. was 7*:23. That this is 80 is shown by
Bhe fact that, taking this number as correct, the differences between the two thermo-
Fnoters disappeared at 0% But even if 7*13 were accepted as the zero-point of C it
Zrould not materially aftect our results.
Z 32. The experiments were conducted in the following manner: —Water was admitted
Zo as to moisten the cotton-wool of both thermometers. Air was then removed as far
Js possible by means of the Cart pump ; it was then disconnected. The condenser
Svas next cooled, when the temperature registered by both thermometers quickly fell
Jo about —5?%. Solidification then took place, the temperatures rapidly rising to 0*,
Smd quickly falling again. The freezing-mixture was then removed, and a little
Jiur introduced, and one tube was jacketed with hot water. Both thermometers
Semained stationary at 0? for 8ome time ; the one which was warmed was allowed to
Fise to about +15%; the other thermometer remained below +3% The freezing-
Snixture was then replaced, and air was slowly removed by the SPRENGEL pump.
