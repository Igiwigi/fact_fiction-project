of the final equilibrium appears to decrease fairly rapidly as the temperature increases.
â€˜The voltages employed in the previous experiments were never great enough to
produce a luminous discharge, though the effect does occur if a luminous discharge
passes. The reduction in the ionisation is greater if the wire is made the cathode
than if it is made the anode.


48 MR. 0. W. RICHARDSON ON THE IONISATION

All the above facts point to the view that the reduction of the negative leak in
hydrogen produced by the application of a high potential is due to a change in the
surface caused by the bombardment of the surface by the positive ions produced in
the gas by ionising collisions. This view is supported by the fact that after the high
potential had been applied a greater heating current was always required to maintain
the wire at its original temperature. This shows that the amount of heat radiated
from the surface at a given temperature was greater than before, so that the nature
of the surface must have become changed in some way.

Two views which are not mutually exclusive may be taken as to the nature of the
action by which the bombardment of the positive ions, which are really weak canal
rays, reduces the negative leak. They may act either by destroying a layer of
positively-charged hydrogen which helps the corpuscles out of the metal, or they may
merely allow the absorbed hydrogen to escape from the wire. The last suggestion
receives strong support from the recent experiments of SKINNER on the evolution of
hydrogen from metallic cathodes under the influence of the luminous discharge.* On
