20. It will be noticed that there is a conspicuous fold in the
ordinary ependymal epithelium just where it joins the sub-commissural organ on
either side, obviously due to the great development of the latter in a dorsi-ventral
direction ; this is probably a very constant character, for a very similar fold occurs
in Geotria (DENDy, 1907, «) and in the mouse (DeNpy and Nicwonrs, 1910). In
fact the sub-commissural organ appears to have a remarkably uniform structure
throughout the Vertebrate series, until it becomes more or less obsolete in the higher
primates. CR. Trext-riG. 20.—Transverse Section through the Posterior Commissure and Sub-Commissural Organ of
