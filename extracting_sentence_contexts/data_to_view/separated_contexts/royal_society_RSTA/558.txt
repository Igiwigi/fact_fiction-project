As an example, CCSM4 shows a pronounced
reduction of precipitation and a reduction of LAI at LGM compared with the PI. The larger surface
albedo thus reflects more radiation back to space in the LGM than in the PI climate. The IPSL-
CM5A-LR simulation shows a local enhancement of the African monsoon that is related to the
fact that the thermohaline circulation is enhanced compared with the PI circulation, reinforcing
the interhemispheric gradient in the tropical Atlantic and favouring the northward migration of
the ITCZ over Africa and thereby the vegetation LAI. In this region the feedback is negative. In
the other places over Africa, the drier climate contributes to the reduction of precipitation and of
LAL, leading to a positive radiative feedback.
