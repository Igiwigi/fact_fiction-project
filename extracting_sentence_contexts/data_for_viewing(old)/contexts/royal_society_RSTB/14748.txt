Dhanraj Vishwanath [334] argues for a ‘tripartite model’ of
visual space, according to which there are three ‘distinct
and dissociated encodings’ for (a) 3D shape, (b) ‘egocentric’
(observer to object) distances, and (c) ‘exocentric’ (object to
object) distances. However, often viewing conditions will
only support one or two of these encodings, explaining the
‘inconsistencies’ reported in the literature above.

Vishwanath argues for these three distinct encodings based
on their different experiential ‘qualities’, in contrast to standard
models that ‘typically do not make a fundamental distinction
among these different modes of spatial experience’. For
instance, the dual nature of pictures reflects the fact that pictor-
ial space supports 3D shape perception but not ‘egocentric’ and
‘exocentric’ distance perception, whilst the vivid separation in
depth typically associated with stereo vision (depth from
disparity) reflects the ‘exocentric’ distance encoding.

15. Affordances/Embodiment: The past couple of decades
have seen the rise of a ‘pragmatic turn’ in cognitive science,
according to which ‘cognition should not be understood as pro-
viding models of the world, but as subserving action’ [335-337].
This has led to increased interest in the visual processing of
‘affordances’ (potential for action) [236,338]. We have already
encountered one such affordance (traversability) in our discus-
