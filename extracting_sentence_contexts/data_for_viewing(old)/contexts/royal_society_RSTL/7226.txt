Mathematical Theory of the Experiment.
A disk oscillates in its own plane about a vertical axis between two fixed horizontal
disks, the amplitude of oscillation diminishing in geometrical progression, to find what
part of the retardation is due to the viscosity of the air between it and the fixed disks.


OR INTERNAL FRICTION OF ATR AND OTHER GASES. 259

That part of the surface of the disk which is not near the edge may be treated as
part of an infinite disk, and we may assume that each horizontal stratum of the fluid
oscillates as a whole. In fact, if the motion of every part of each stratum can be
accounted for by the actions of the strata above and below it, there will be no mutual
action between the parts of the stratum, and therefore no relative motion between its

Let 8 be the angle which defines the angular position of the stratum which is at the
distance y from the fixed disk, and let 7 be the distance of a point of that stratum from

the axis, then its velocity will be r S and the tangential force on its lower surface arising

from viscosity will be on unit of surface
