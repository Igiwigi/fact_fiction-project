As we can count about ten discharges, we may take it that the damping
is small and therefore the time of an oscillation 24\/LC, if L is the self-induction. From this we calculate that our self-induction was about 3000; for steady currents
a rough estimate of our circuit gave a self-induction of 1000, and we know that
for rapid oscillations it must be greater. If we adopt the higher number, we may
further conclude that the total resistance of our circuit must have been small
compared to 20 ohms, while, taking the lower estimate for the coefficient of self-
induction, the resistance was small compared to 12 ohms, a further proof, if one
were needed, of the fact that once the insulating property of air is broken down,
its conductivity may be large. We do not wish to enter further into some interesting
