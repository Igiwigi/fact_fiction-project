My specimens were probably less pure than that analysed by FaRapar. I am anxious to call attention to the fact that the atomic constitution of caoutchouc
appears to bear some simple relation to the hydrocarbons resulting from its decompo-
sition by heat. The composition of caoutchouc coincides with that of isoprene and
caoutchine, as found by analysis, to a degree which is remarkable when we consider that
caoutchoue, in addition to being non-crystalline, is scarcely capable of purification by
chemical means. Additional evidence may be found in the 8mallness of the residue
which is left on submitting caoutchoue to heat.
