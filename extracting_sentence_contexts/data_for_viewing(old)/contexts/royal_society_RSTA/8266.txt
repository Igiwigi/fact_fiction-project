curves of fig. 4 coincide at low temperatures but separate at high temperatures.”

* The law « « P predicts a null absolute magnitude effect at high temperatures as arising from changes
of atmospheric thickness and of ionization; the two effects neutralise one another. But this does not
preclude other effects of g-changes. For example reduced g, which causes reduced P, will cause a
decreased Stark effect, which might be used as an absolute magnitude criterion. I owe this remark to
discussions with Miss Wititams, of Harvard College Observatory. See ‘Harvard College Observatory
Bulletin,”’ No. 870 (in press.)


450 EK. A. MILNE ON STRUCTURE AND OPACITY OF A STELLAR ATMOSPHERE.

The observed facts are that hydrogen shows a strong absolute magnitude effect at
temperatures below A,* (increasing intensity accompanying increasing luminosity)
and the c-effect in classes A and B (increasing sharpness accompanying increasing
luminosity). The second effect is well shown in Payne and Witi1aw’s line-contours
(loc. cit.) for stars of type B;. If following Unséup we take increasing sharpness to
indicate a decreasing number of fully-viewed atoms, then the observed facts correspond
to a kind of mixture of the effects shown by our two diagrams. At low temperatures,
the hypothesis « « P is confirmed; the curves for the lower g-values lie above the
