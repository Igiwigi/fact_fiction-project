carotid of Lepus is not the same vessel as that of similar name in other forms: that the
carotid foramen of Lepus is likewise different ; and that the alicochlear commissure is
not the trabecula.

In answer to this, it may be said that the entry of the carotid artery into the cavum
epiptericum as described by Vorr in Lepus is altogether exceptional. Gaupr (1911)
draws attention to the fact that in Talpa and in Mus, the carotid enters directly into the
cranial cavity. The same is true in Phocwena (DE BuRLET, 1913a) and in Echidna
(Gaupp, 1908). In the cat, ‘Terry (1917, p. 383) says that the alicochlear commissure
* does not, in the cat, enter into the floor of the cavum epiptericum, nor does the carotid
artery pass directly into the primary cranial cavity. The vessel first traverses that
part of the membrana limitans which is fixed to the cranial floor, before passing into the
original cavity of the skull.” In Sorex, the lateral half of the alicochlear commissure
does form the floor on which the limiting membrane of the cavum epiptericum rests.
The carotid artery on rising through its foramen finds itself median to the inner mem-
brane of the cavum epiptericum, and just beneath the dura mater, which it pierces to
enter the cranial cavity. At its very point of entry through the carotid foramen, the
carotid artery is median to the abducens nerve.
