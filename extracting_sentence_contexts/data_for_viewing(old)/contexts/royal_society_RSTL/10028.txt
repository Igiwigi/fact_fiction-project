1028 DR, W. H. GASKELL ON THE RHYTHM OF THE HEART OF

that the protoplasm does not form the explosive snbstance directly, but that there are
intermediate stages corresponding to the zymogenic stage in the gland. According to
this view there would be in the cardiac muscle during its normal activity three pro-
cesses going on : the growth of the protoplasm with the aid of the raw material from
the nutritive fluid surrounding the muscle fibres ; the transformation of the protoplasm
into intermediate products, which are non-explosible, or at least explosible with diffi-
culty ; and the formation from these of eagily explosible material; in fact, a gradual
succession from stable to more and more unstable combinations, If, then, the formative
activity of the muscle be distributed over these three stages in the right proportion, it
follows that impulses passing to the musele at equal times must all cause contractions
of equal force, Tf, however, that activity be exclusively directed towards the forma-
tion of the muscle protoplasm or the intermediate non-explosible substances ib is con-
ceivable that no contractions shovld be able to take place, because no suitable material
was ready for the impulses to act upon, though as a.natural consequence of this greater
activity in the formation of the intermediate substances the ultimate effect would be
that the snbsequent contractions would be very much greater than before. On this
view, then, the force of the contraction at any time depends upon the relative rates
at which these three processes proceed.
