Step 3: stabilization or antagonization of gene activation by trans-acting IncRNA and dsRNA. In addition, if
interaction of chromatinic IncRNA with small dsRNA occurs, it would add further complexity to the transcription regulatory dimensions. In fact, association between
IncRNAs (eRNA and pancRNA) and mRNAs have been reported to be modulated further by the association of small dsRNAs with the IncRNAs and/or genomic DNA,
as described above. In addition, small dsRNA can associate with trans-acting proteins including DNMT and MBD proteins, to allosterically modulate their functions or
to mask their catalytic domains, as described in the text. In non-neuronal cells and in neural progenitors, REST potential members of the REST complex are also targets of mul-
represses miR-124 [65].
