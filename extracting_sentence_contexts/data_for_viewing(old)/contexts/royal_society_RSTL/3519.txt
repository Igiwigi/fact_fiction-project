q vii. Active voltaic circles and batteries without metallic contact.

2017. There are cases in abundance of electric currents produced by pure chemical
action, but not one undoubted instance of the production of a current by pure con-
tact. As I conceive the great question must now be settled by the weight of evi-
dence, rather than by simple philosophic conclusions (1799.), I purpose adding a few

observations and facts to show the number of these cases, and their force. In the
Eighth Series of these Researches* (April, 1834,) I gave the first experiment, that I
am aware of, in which chemical action was made to produce an electric current and
chemical decomposition at a distance, in a simple circuit, without any contact of
metals (880, &c.). It was further shown, that when a pair of zinc and platinum
plates were excited at one end by dilute nitro-sulphuric acid (880.), or solution of
potash (884.), or eyen in some cases a solution of common salt (885.), decomposi-
tions might be produced at the other end, of solutions of iodide of potassium (900.)
protochloride of tin (901.), sulphate of soda, muriatic acid, and nitrate of silver (906.);
or of the following bodies in a state of fusion ; nitre, chlorides of silver and lead, and
iodide of lead (902. 906.); no metallic contact being allowed in any of the experiments.

2018. I will proceed to mention new cases; and first, those already referred to,
