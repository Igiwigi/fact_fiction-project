posure to any other exciting cause, it rapidly recovers its normal condition as to
temperature.

7. That when labouring under disease, however slight, the temperature is abnor-
mally elevated ; and that—judging from observations made, but not recorded, in the
Tables—its undue degree is some criterion of the intensity of the diseased action.

8. That within the tropics there is comparatively little difference of temperature
between the surface of the body, especially the extremities and the internal parts ;—
and that there the skin is more active in its function of transpiration and the kidneys
are less active as secreting organs; with which it may be conjectured is connected a
rapid production and desquamation of cuticle, and the absence, in great part or en-
tirely, of lithic acid in the urinary secretion. This latter fact, however, may be ex-
plained in a different manner, on the supposition that the acid is not formed in the
blood, or if formed, in a greatly diminished quantity.

9. That the effect of wine, unless used in great moderation, is commonly lower-
ing, that is as to temperature, whilst it accelerates the heart's action, followed after a
while by an increase of temperature.

10. That the tendency of sea-sickness is to check what may be considered the
natural fluctuation of the temperature, and when severe, like disease, to elevate the
temperature,
