temperature, conductivity and pressure during the seals’ dives, which, in the case of elephant
seals, can reach up to 2000m depth. The resulting temperature and salinity profiles are
compressed and transmitted back by satellite when the seal is at the surface or on sea ice, as
well as being stored on the tag, where the full data can be downloaded if the tag is recovered.
The tags are glued to the seals’ fur and fall off when they moult, after a maximum of 1 year. In
addition to measuring oceanographic data, they also provide information about the seals’ diving
and foraging behaviour, and even their physical condition [39].

Both southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) [40] and Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddelli)
[41,42] have been used in the Antarctic. The elephant seals are usually tagged on beaches on sub-
Antarctic and Antarctic islands, whereas the Weddell seals are tagged on sea ice. Seal data have
been used together with Argo floats to determine the positions of the fronts in the ACC [16]. This
is helped by the fact that many of the frontal areas are biologically productive, and therefore are
good feeding grounds for the seals. While it is possible to target ocean regions and types of area


(frontal zones versus shelf break) by selecting seals by area, age and sex, seals do have a mind of ls |
their own and it can be difficult, if not impossible, to predict exactly where the seals will travel

and obtain data. However, even if seals do not venture far from the location in which they are 3
tagged, they can still provide very useful time series [43] or sections [42] in areas where winter- : s
time data are lacking, and where oceanographic moorings stand a high chance of being damaged <
or destroyed by icebergs. : S

In total, seals have yielded more than 270000 CTD profiles, accounting for more than 70% of 13
