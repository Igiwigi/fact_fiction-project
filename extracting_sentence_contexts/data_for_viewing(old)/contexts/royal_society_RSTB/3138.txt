4 4820, he was distinctly below the normal in the extent of his green sensation on
this side, and greatly below the normal as regards the intensity of it.

His red sensation extended to a little beyond 47606. He could see Fraun-
HOFER A easily.

His green sensation appears to be weak, and his violet sensation somewhat strong.

No. XV.—Probably almost Blue-blind.
A Man of Culture, but with no Special Knowledge of Spectroscopy.

This case was in some respects unusual. The spectrum was not shortened, and
in fact, extended farther into the red beyond A and into the violet beyond K than
with most normal-sighted persons. But his description of the colours of the
spectrum was abnormal. It was as follows :—‘“ There are two principal colour-
changes, namely, from red to green (at 45905) and from green to blue (at 4810),
of which the latter is the more definite.” So far, both of these agree sufficiently

description.

From A to B he called “red.” Beyond B it began to be tinged with “ yellow,”
becoming “ full yellow” at 46130, he sodium lines he called a “ gorgeous yellow,”
but could not detect any rapid change of tint on each side of them, though to the
majority of people the change is more rapid here than in any other part of the
