intact.

But though as regards discoverable symptoms the case was negative, the micro.
scopical investigation of the brain revealed facts of great importance both as regards
the anatomical relations and probable physiological significance of the prefrontal:
cerebral regions. b

The sections demonstrate the occurrence of secondary degeneration or sclerosis of
certain fibres of the internal capsule and crura cerebri. These occupy the lowermost, -
and mos internal aspect of the transverse sections of the internal capsule, and the
most median bundles of the foot of the crus cerebri. The further destination of these
bundles, whether they end in the corpora quadrigemina or in the pons, was not deter-
mined, But the facts demonstrated show that the prefrontal regions are anatomically
in connexion with the median bundles of the foot of the crus and corresponding fibres
of the internal capsule.

Experiment 23 (Plate 27, figs. 74-86).

In this animal the frontal lobes were exposed on both sides, and the cortex cauterised
extensively towards the base of the three frontal convolutions. When this was done
first on the left side the eyes were seen to be deviated to the left. On the right side
the destruction was somewhat less extensive. In less than an hour after the opera-
tion the animal was able to sib up and move about spontaneously, keeping its head
down and its eyes shut. No further observations were made at this time. Next
day the animal was found resting on its perch in a drowsy condition with its eyes
