This I did in two ways :
first, by observing that in many cases (and especially in Cyanea capillata) the rate of
the rhythm is 80 slow that the contractions do not follow one another till a considerable
interval of total relaxation has intervened ; and second, by placing the terminals
close together 80 as to include only a small piece of tissne between them, and then
firmly pinning the tissue all round the electrodes to a piece of wood placed beneath
the Medusa. In this way the small portion of tissne which served as the seat of
stimulation was itself prevented from moving, and therefore the rhythmic motions

which the rest of the Medusa presented cannot have been due to any variations in the
quality of the contact between the electrodes and this stationary seat of stimulation,

(f.) Any such merely mechanical source of fallacy being thus, I think, excluded,
we are compelled to regard the facts of artificial rhythm as of a purely physiological
kind. The question, therefore, as to the explanation of these facts becomes one of the
highest interest, and the hypothesis which I have framed to answer it is as follows. Every time the tissne contracts ib must as a consequence suffer a certain amount of
exhaustion, and therefore must become slightly less sensitive to stimulation than it
was before.
