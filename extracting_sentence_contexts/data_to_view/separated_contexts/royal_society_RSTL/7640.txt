79. In the case above considered of the tenth species, S(3*), for which
AF+BG+CH==0, the three forms of the reciprocal equation are of course absolutely
equivalent to each other. The first form has the advantage of putting in evidence the

fact that the reciprocal scroll is also of the tenth species; the other two forms do not.
at least obviously, put in evidence any special property of the reciprocal scroll. Reciprocals of Eighth Species, $(1, 3), and Ninth Species, $(1).
80. If AF+BG+CH=0, then the equation

(H, F, C, B, A—F, —G'Lp, g, r=0
is a scroll of the eighth species, S(1, 3*).
