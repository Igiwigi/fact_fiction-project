for a few hours in a stream of low-pressure hydrogen to remove possible occlusions
of the solvent.

The experimental procedure adopted was as follows. After the introduction of the
sulphur into the well W, the system was exhausted through B by means of a small
rotary pump; then a continuous stream of hydrogen at low pressure was passed
through the tube for the duration of the exposure. Under these conditions it was
found that the hydrogen stream carried through the capillary just enough vapour
from W to give a spectrum of fairly high intensity and excellent definition. When
a higher sulphur pressure was required, the well was gently warmed. The long neck
at A, together with the fact that the stream of gas carried the sulphur vapour away
from the window, prevented serious fouling of the latter ; an hourly touch with a small
pointed flame sufficed to keep it clear.

The hydrogen pressure in the tube was maintained at about 1 mm. by continued
exhaustion at B, the supply from the reservoir of the voltameter (which was at
