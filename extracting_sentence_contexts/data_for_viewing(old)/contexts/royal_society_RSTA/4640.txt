as the low land is reserved for commercial and industrial purposes. Many coastal communities
on low-land devastated areas are thus moving uphill by applying for relocation and buy-out
programme. Scattering residential areas will isolate people and weaken community connections,
and consequently, undermine the community’s sustainability with shrinking population in rural
areas. Then the question is ‘what are the great seawalls for?’. This problem is not yet solved.

As observed in devastated areas in Japan, tsunami flow depths over 2m have the potential to
severely damage houses. High rise RC buildings with robust columns and walls can withstand
tsunami flow depths over 2m and can be used for vertical evacuation. However, at the same


time, at least eight RC or steel construction buildings have been found overturned or washed
away. This fact led to a revision of the requirement for structural design of tsunami evacuation
buildings [51], specifically focusing on the tsunami loading effect. School buildings should
have similar construction requirements, in order to ensure children’s safety. Teachers, parents
and children should have more opportunities to learn about their risk and how to survive in
emergency situations.

Following the expanded seismic/tsunami monitoring network by installing broadband
seismometers and offshore tsunami monitoring systems, JMA’s tsunami warning increased its
capability for quicker and more accurate estimation of earthquake magnitude and tsunami.
However, learning the lessons, we should note that there are still limitations on the reliability of
technologies that can be used in such a limited amount of time. Tsunami warning information can
inform people that they are in danger, but it cannot guarantee people’s safety. The most important
lesson is that one should not wait for official information to act: strong ground shaking is the first : =
