The winters in
Tibet are almost unendurable from this cause. The isothermals dip deeply from the
north into Central Asia during the winter, the earth's heat being wasted without impe-
diment in space, and no sun existing sufficiently powerful to make good the loss. T
believe the fact is well established that the desert of Sahara, which during the day is
burning hot, is often extremely cold at night. This effect has been hitherto referred in
a general way to the © purity of the air;” but purity, as judged by the eye, is a yery
imperfect test of radiation, for the existence of large quantities of vapour is consistent
with a transparent atmosphere. The purity really consists im the absence of aqueous
vapour from those s0-called rainless districts, which, when the sun is withdrawn, enables
the hot surface of the earth to run speedily down to a freezing temperature.
