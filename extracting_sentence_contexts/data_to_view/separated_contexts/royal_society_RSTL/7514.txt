Hyalonems sends down perpendicularly a coil of strong spicules
which gradually spread till they reach a stratum firm enough to give them anchorage. The question naturally arises, how is this enormously extended layer of animal life
nourished? The dredge brings up no plants from great depths; and although from the
fact that many of the higher invertebrates which are associated with the sponges and
rhizopods have eyes and are brightly coloured, it seems probable that a certain amount
of light penetrates to the abysses ; it certainly does not appear to be in the form which
is necessary for the decomposition of binary compounds by plants. To meet this diffi-
culty it has been suggested that the PROTOZ0A, the Prowsra of HAECKEL, may have the
power, though in a minor degree, of assimilating the elements of water, carbonic acid,
and ammonia*. Tt has appeared to us that the nutrition of this animal layer may be
explained more simply, and that it may even be found to be a necessary complement
to the received doctrine of the © balance of organic nature.”
