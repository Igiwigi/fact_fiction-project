Fig. 10. Vector diagram in horizontal plane. Year.

The year diagram from the eleven years does not show a close resemblance to the
diagram of any individual month in fig. 8, a suggestive fact in connection with the
significance of mean diurnal inequalities for the whole year. The equinoctial months
are those whose diagrams show most resemblance to that for the whole year.

ยง 13. Fig. 11 shows vector diagrams in two vertical planes. The upper six curves
refer to the vertical plane through the geographical west, the lower six to the
vertical plane through geographical north. The upper three WV curves and the
upper three NV curves represent the mean diurnal inequalities for the three seasons
derived from the whole eleven years. The three lower diagrams in each case
represent the mean diurnal inequality for the year, derived respectively from the
