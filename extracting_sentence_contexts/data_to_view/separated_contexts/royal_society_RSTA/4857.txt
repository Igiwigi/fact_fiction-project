The direction of the lines of force depends on three
things, the earth, the controlling magnet, and the suspending magnet. MAXweELtâ€™s
diagram. fig. 15, represents the case of the discovery well, but the matter is compli-
cated by the fact that the resultant field of earth and control magnet is far from
uniform even before it is distorted by the suspended magnet. [t seemed likely that much of the difficulty would be removed by making the
residual field more uniform, and with this object two additional and similar control
magnets were introduced below the suspended system, and adjusted by trial till they
were as nearly as possible symmetrically placed with respect to it and the upper
adjustable system. The magnets were of the dimensions and at the distances shown
in the drawing (figs.
