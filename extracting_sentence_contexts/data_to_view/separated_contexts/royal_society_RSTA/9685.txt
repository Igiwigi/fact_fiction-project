The differences between the values calculated from the lines and from the multiples
of 3, are (p between +1 giving the observation error in D,, (2)).

38°44+288+3'0y+14p—22q with 246, = 8441
20+34'3s+4y+17p—26q ,, 288, = 9869. It is clear that either can easily be made to vanish well within possible errors,
more especially the latter. The limit 30819 is higher than that of Ag instead of
lower as might be inferred from the fact that the limit of Ag is lower than that of Cu. The limit 29465 is 1179 below that of Ag, which is itself 931 below that of Cu. This seems a probable order of magnitude, especially when it is remembered that there
is a gap in the Periodic Table between Ag and Au.
