Q acetosd, which is the most, and very, prominent on both, is upon the whole the more
AQ prominent on plot 10. Next, but in much less quantity, come the Conopodium
Ss denudatum, and the Achillea millefolium, both of which are much declining, but are
= somewhab more prominent on plot 9 than on plot 10,
= Thus, there was considerable similarity in the number and desecription of species on
= the two plots, and some, but less, in the proportion by weight of individual species ;
2 whilst, the weight per acre of total gramineous herbage was much less, and that of
5 both the leguminous and the miscellaneous was also the less, on plot 10. The character
;= of development also was extremely different, On plot 9, with the continuous supply
2 of potass, the grasses showed much tendency to produce stem and seed, and to mature.
5 On plot 10, on the other hand, with the only temporary supply of potass, the propor-
S tion of leaf to stem was very much greater, the herbage was patchy, of a much darker
Ss green colour, and matured unevenly, and imperfectly. There was, in fact, a relative
& plethora of nitrogen, and with the deficiency of potass a deficient assimilation of
G carbon.
b= With these great differences in the character of development apparent to the eye,
Z there were corresponding differences in the chemical composition quite consistent with
= them and their cause.
Â£ In the dry substance of the produce grown with the deficient supply of potass there
2 was a considerably higher, and an abnormally high, percentage of nitrogen, and a
= lower percentage of total mineral matter. There was a considerably higher percentage
A of lime, magnesia, phosphorie acid, and sulphurie acid ; a quadruple percentage of
soda; with this a considerably increased percentage of silica, and ab the same time
a very greatly increased percentage of chlorine. There was, on the other hand, in
the dry substance of this leafy, highly nitrogenous, and immature produce, over the
