The method first adopted for the measurement, of the velocity of transit was to
arrange a very sensitive circuit-closer in a position only a few feet distant from the
point where the weight fell. This circuit-closer being connected with a pair of wires
leading to a chronograph, situated at a point 560 feet distant from the cireuit-closer,
served to bring this chronograph in action. An observer stationed heside the chrono-
graph, with his hand on a contact key, broke the circuit at the instant the surface of
mercury in a vessel placed on the ground beside him was seb into vibration. The
corrections, personal and instrumental, in this method were evidently somewhat
difficult, and it was abandoned before any very good results were obtained by it.
The lowest result obtained by this method was about 380 feet per second and the
highest about 930 feet, the' average being 630 feet. The explanation of this very
high result was no doubt to be found partly in the circuit-closer, which was at that
time in various ways imperfect, and partly in the fact that the fall of the weight could
be readily heard through the air. This may have caused the observer to anticipate
the very mall vibration which was produced in the mercury. The circuit-closer was
caused sometimes by the rapid up and down movement of the earth to leap out of
contact immediately after haying closed the circuit; in such cases the chronograph did

not act until the cirenit became permanently closed. The result of this was evidently
to reduce the apparent time of transit and hence increase the velocity.

The second cause of error above indicated was rendered very likely by the fact that
