The Sun's light conſiſts of rays differing by indefinite
degrees of Refraogibility.

2. Rays which differ in refravgibility , when parted from
one another do proportionally differ in the colors which they
exhibit. Theſetwo Propoſitions are matter of fact.

3+ There are as mavy ſimple or homogeneal colorsas de-
zrees of refrangibility. For, to every degree of retrangibi-
'ity belongsa different color,by Prop.2.And that coloris ſimple
by Def. 1, and 3.

4: Whitenels in all reſpeRts like that of the Sun's immediate
light andof all the uſual objeC&ts of our ſenſes cannot be com-
pounded of two imple colors alone. For ſuch a compoſition

. muſt be made by rays that have only two degrees of refran-
gibility,by Def: 1. and 33 and thereforejt cannot be like that
of the Suns lighr,by Prop. 1; Nor,for the ſame reaſoo, like that
of ordinary white objedts.

5, Whiteneb in all reſpeRs like that of the Sun's immedi-
ate light cannot be compounded of fimple colors without an
indefinite variety of them, For to ſuch a compoſition there
are requiſite rays indued with all the indefinite degrees of rcs
frangibility,by Prop. 1.
