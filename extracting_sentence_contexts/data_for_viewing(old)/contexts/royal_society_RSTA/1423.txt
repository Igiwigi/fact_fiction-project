probing soft, adhesive polymer surfaces or as a result of surface heterogeneities. Regardless, it
is evident that CNCs have a positive effect on the adhesive nature of the latex film. Pakdel et al.
[8] reported that while the CNCs do not inherently improve the adhesive quality of the polymer,
they do improve the overall wettability of the latex. This wettability (i.e. increased hydrophilicity)
results in a higher affinity between the latex film and—in this case—the hydrophilic silica probe,
leading to an increased work of adhesion. It should be noted that the affinity, and as such,
the wettability, of the latex will be substantially different for less hydrophilic probes (or other
adherends).

We hypothesized that the work of adhesion (measured on the nanoscale) required to detach
the colloid probe from these latex films would be correlated to the tack and peel strength of
the PSAs; however, this was not the case. The linear trend of increasing work of adhesion as
a function of CNC loading was, in fact, not representative of the trends for EHA/BA/MMA
PSAs where the tack or peel strength initially increased with increasing CNC loading (from
0 to 0.5 wt%) but then decreased above 0.5 wt% CNCs [6]. The previously reported peel strengths
