Since there are six 60° directions
in the 360 degrees of the horizontal plane, the rotational sym-
metry order is sixfold (order 6). The symmetric pattern of grid cell raises questions about
what, if anything, this symmetry may be for, and the extent to
which there are symmetries in the spatial firing of the other
spatial neurons as well. Below, we look at the data on sym-
metry and symmetry-breaking in the spatial neurons,
looking at both rotational and translational symmetries and
asymmetries, and then speculate as to how these properties
may relate to the encoding of space.

(a) Place cells

The firing of a place cell in an ordinary, simple, bounded
arena such as a square box is, in contrast to grid cells,
rather asymmetric, inasmuch as the cells rarely fire in the
exact centre of a symmetric enclosure (figure 3a), despite
the fact that the boundaries of the enclosure are an important
determinant of the location of the firing fields [6]. In a rota-
tionally symmetric enclosure such as a square or circle, the
off-centre place field breaks the symmetry such that the
rotational order is only onefold — a full 360-degree rotation
is needed to map the pattern back onto itself. The sources
of this symmetry-breaking still remain to be fully elucidated,
