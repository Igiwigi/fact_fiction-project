Thus we can build up the general solution

Se ay, , (2), - (a),
w= sin a (L, e’ ‘+ M,e’* *-+ N,e’r

r

Now it is not possible to determine all the constants L,, M,, N, by satisfying the initial
conditions of displacement and velocity, and the solution is indeterminate. This
appears to be a contradiction to theorem I (p. 370), concerning the uniqueness of solution.
It seems that this is due to the fact that the solution is only approximate. We proceed
to show that one of the roots is always large, provided that y/w’ and 2/2’ are large
(experiments on the damping of the vibrations of a torsional pendulum suggest a value
of about 104 sec-1+), while the other two roots may be small if the value of y is sufficiently
small,
We write the relation (3-42) as

F(p) =P (a+ w+ (0 + 2) vl +2 4 uy! p){(32 + Qu) + (30' + 22’) pH] =O.

* The same p —y relation is obtained when the problem is investigated for a circular cylinder on the
same lines as on p. 289 in Love's “ Blasticity ” for a perfeetly elastic circular cylinder. This solution
also is only approximate as there is a surface traction over the ends ; and the approximation is again best
for the graver modes. This comparison is a partial justification of the solution given above.
