In [15], we modify the above approach. We consider some yp above the critical value and compute
the solution with maximum value of Q along the bifurcation curve Cy,. Then we fix Q and instead
consider y as the bifurcation parameter, looking for a solution for y < ycrit < yo. Now we switch
back to Q as the bifurcation parameter and compute the upper section of C,,, bounded above by
the wave of maximal wave height and below by the wave with stagnation point at the bottom.
The last wave we could compute was at y = ye = —3.062. Numerical experiments show that this
approach works and that waves with stagnation point at the top exist even for vorticities below
the critical value (figure 8).

In summary, the y-continuation technique in the interval (ye, ycrit) indicates the existence of
waves that have a stagnation point on the free surface, for vorticities below the critical value, and
conjectures the existence of waves with stagnation points both at the crest and at the bottom,
right below the crest. We emphasize the fact that the pressure of the fluid displays a qualitative
change for values of vorticity smaller than the critical value. Indeed, in figure 9a, where we depict
the pressure of the fluid at the bottom, we see that when y < ycrit the pressure at the point right
below the crest displays a ‘plateau’ behaviour instead of a local maximum, which characterizes
flows with y > Yerit-

The former behaviour is more transparent in figure 9b. Considering the point of the bifurcation
curve for which this ‘plateau’ behaviour of the pressure is more distinct, we make the following
three observations. First, for y = yerit, this takes place in the neighbourhood of the point on
the bifurcation curve where the gap will appear, namely Qc. Second, if ye < y < yerit, then this
behaviour occurs for the two substantially different waves, which correspond to the endpoints of
