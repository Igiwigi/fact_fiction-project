Kobin H. Kendrick A striking feature of human informal social interaction is that participants rapidly

communication channel. Turn-taking characterizes the primary context for
language use, it is found in all cultures across the globe, it creates the interactional
niche in which children acquire language and in which language presumably
evolved, and it is even observed in the vocal and gestural communication of
other species [1-4]. In the case of human conversational exchange, the timing
and precision of turn-taking raises interesting questions about the underlying
mechanisms—turns alternate with very short gaps (on average close to the mini-
mum human response time of 200 ms) and with very few overlaps (typically less
than 5% of the speech stream; [5]). A puzzle is that this rapid exchange of turns is
so seamlessly accomplished despite the fact that individual turns are unpredict-
able in length and content, the number of participants can vary, and provision
has to be made for longer turns to allow, e.g. the telling of a story.

The remarkable precision of turn-taking seems to be grounded in principles
that were first outlined in in the field of conversation analysis (CA), since tested
in 40 years of close observation and detailed description of turn-taking in

turn transition in a normative way [6]. The standard model makes many specific
