fitted to the plate. d
After 40 hours incubation, 2.e., at 10 A.M. on August 6, this plate showed
distinct, though, as yet, faint, clearer areas, corresponding to those parts of the
which lay beneath the two slots, as shown in fig. 1, Plate 87. %
In fig. 2, Plate 87, I have shown by means of vertical lines the subdivisions of te
areas into the various parts of the spectrum.
Tn each case the exact length of the slot, and therefore of the portion tna
visible and invisible parts of the spectrum, is marked by the distance A-B. i
The line C indicates the beginning of the visible red of the spectrum : conse
the area to the left is the infra-red. Between D and E are the orange and ye
regions. E to F includes the green; F to G is the blue; and G to H the wi
violet. To the right of H is the ultra-violet, of course invisible.
Several facts are obvious at a glance. In the first place the bactericidal
begins almost exactly on the boundary between the green and the blue, i.e., atthe

line F in the photograph,‚Äù and, in the lower spectrum, extends right away inteth

ultra-violet. In the upper spectrum this extension of the effect into the ultr

is much curtailed, owing to the opacity of the glass for these rays.
Secondly, the maximum effect, as seen by the widening out of the affected i
is just beyond the violet. I have already pointed out that I explain this wide
due to the action of the most potent reflected rays being still powerful enov,
produce some action.
Thirdly, it is clear from the first that the infra-red, red, orange-yellow, and :
