effect on the results obtained, a series of experiments was performed in which water was
placed inside the cylinder to form the column, the outer medium being air. As before, the
column was rapidly withdrawn and the motion of the surge so produced was recorded.
The experiments were then repeated using the densest zinc chloride solution employed,
p, = 1-75. If the increase of viscosity were having an appreciable effect it would appear as
a difference between the readings obtained in the two cases. The two sets of readings were,
however, in good agreement, indicating that the increase in viscosity necessitated by the
use of dense solutions was not having a considerable effect on the results obtained.

RESULTS
4, EXPERIMENTAL ERRORS

Errors in the readings obtained came mainly from the fact that usually only one diameter
of the surge could be measured from the photographs, which were ‘side elevations’, so that
measurements on the fall of the column and the surge height could also be made. The surges
produced were in all cases circular at first but in the later stages irregularities appeared,
which could have produced errors of 10 to 15% in the value of the radius measured round
the surge. Apart from this expected error there may have been consistent errors involved in
the experimental procedure.

These would comprise:

(1) Energy introduced by the raising of the tube.
(2) Increased energy dissipation due to the finite size of the tank.
