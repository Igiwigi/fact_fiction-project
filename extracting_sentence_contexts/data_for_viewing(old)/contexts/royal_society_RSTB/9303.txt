cannot be overstated. Yet, vaccines do not confer equal protection to all vaccine
recipients (table 1). A recent dramatic example is that among the 1521 cases of a

association in immune response among vaccinees and to understand the causes of variability.

Asa matter of fact, anew branch of omics—called vaccinomics—has evolved that
aims to understand the mechanisms of heterogeneity in immune responses to vac-
cines [2]. Many twin and family studies [3-6] have shown that vaccine immune

and aims to identify these factors for predicting and minimizing vaccine failures
or adverse events. While there are multiple parameters by which to measure
immune response in a vaccinee [7-9], levels of various immunoglobulins have
traditionally been used. This is because immune response usually involves the
production of antibodies or immunoglobulins by B lymphocytes. It is now well
established that for various vaccines, genetic effects play a dominant role in
immune response [10-12]. Epigenomic effects are also becoming evident [13].
Quantification of immune response at various stages after vaccination is also
