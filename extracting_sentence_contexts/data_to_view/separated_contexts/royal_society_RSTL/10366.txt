An examination of the lines of total Graminew, total Leguminose, and total Mis-
Scellanez, will show that, in the second separation-year, that is after the effects of the
Echange had become thoroughly established, there was a diminution, both in the per-
Scentage and in the yield per acre, of the grasses, a very great diminution, both in
percentage and yield, of the leguminous herbage, and a greater increase in those of the
miscellaneous herbage. But it will be remembered that the second separation-year
was one pre-eminently favourable to a relative excess of the miscellaneous species ;
still, in the third and fourth separation-years, there was also a higher percentage
proportion, and amount, of snch herbage than in the first. There was at the same time
a continued diminution in both the percentage and actual amount of the leguminous
herbage ; in fact, only about one-sixth as much was grown in the fourth as in the first
separation-year. The total yield of the Graminew also diminished very much from the
first to the third, but increased again considerably in the fourth separation-year. The
fluctuations according to seagon were, indeed, very considerable.
