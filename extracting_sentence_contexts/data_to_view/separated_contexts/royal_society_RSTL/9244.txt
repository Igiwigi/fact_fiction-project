The first column of Table I. sghows the
angle by which the crest of the lunar semi-diurnal tide precedes the moon ; we 86e
that the angle is almost doubled at the end of the series of changes, as traced back-
wards. It is not quite 80 easy to give a physical meaning to the other columns,
although it might be done. In fact, as the rotation increases, the effect of each tide
rises to a maximum, and then dies away ; the tides of longer period reach their maxi-
mum effect much more slowly than the ones of short period. At the point where I
have found it convenient to stop the golution (8&6 Table IV.), the semi-diurnal effect has
passed its maximum, the diurnal tide has just come to give its maximum effect, whilst
the fortnightly tide has not nearly risen to that point,


AND ON THE REMOTE HISTORY OF THE EARTH. 531

As the lunar effects increase in importance (when we look backwards), the relative
value of the solar effects decreases rapidly, because the solar tidal reaction leaves bhe
earth's orbit sensibly unaffected (see Section 19), and thus the solar effects remain nearly
constant, whilst the lunar effects have largely increased.
