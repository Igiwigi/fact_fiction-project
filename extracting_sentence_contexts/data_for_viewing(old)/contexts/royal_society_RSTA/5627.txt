which uniquely determines the pressure (up to a constant) and also determines its regularity in
terms of the regularity of the tensor (u ® u). For instance, for u € Ck (2), standard Hélder elliptic
regularity (cf. [1] chapter 3 or [2] chapter 3) states that for any integer k > 0, p belongs also to the
space C*(Q). In the presence a boundary 4, taking the scalar product with the interior normal
ni of the first equation of (1.2), one obtains, now for k > 2, the relation:

d :2

ij=1 [3

In (1.4), the second identity follows from the fact that u is tangential to the boundary 02, (i.e. DG
u-n=0 on 92 which is a level surface of the scalar function u - 7). On 02, Vii is called the aa
Weingarten matrix. It is determined in terms of the principal curvatures of 02, and in two iy
dimensions, it is a scalar, i.e. the curvature y of 992. Therefore, it is natural to use :

—dsp=(U@u): Vi, ond, (1.5) : Ss

as the boundary condition for the pressure in weak formulation, when the boundary 9 € C?.
The first observation is that equations (1.3) and (1.4) may define p only up to a constant as
stated in the following:

Proposition 1.1. Let (p,q) € (D'(2))* be two extendable distributional solutions of (1.3) and (1.4),
ie. distributions which are defined in an open neighbourhood of 2. Then r =p — q which is a solution of
