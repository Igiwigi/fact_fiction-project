The key issues involve not only what constitutes the most accu-
rate way to present the findings, but also how the manner of
presentation and how it is presented affects what is actually
understood by the trier of fact when hearing expert opinions
[11], and these problems are compounded if those opinions
involve decision scales [12], or statistics and probabilities [13,14]. These are important issues. How forensic evidence is pre-
sented is at least as important as what is presented, because
the ‘packaging’ determines to a large extent if and how the
trier of fact takes on board the content. Of course, the presen-
tation of forensic evidence has to be effective and accurate. However, beyond that there are many other factors at play.
