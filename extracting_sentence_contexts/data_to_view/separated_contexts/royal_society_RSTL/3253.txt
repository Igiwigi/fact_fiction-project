Also at the junction of the plutonic with
the metamorphic formations, we see tortuous thread-like veins branching from the
former into the latter, which could only have been injected when quite liquid. Here
the rock has been melted at a great depth under an enormous pressure, and yet the
fluidity must bave been very perfect: snch plutonic rocks moreover form the beds
on which all others rest. Considering these latter facts, together with the inferences
deduced from the phenomena observed in South America, it may be granted as not
improbable in any high degree, that this part of Scotland when it was upraised rested

on matter possessed of considerable fluidity, which underwent a slow change of form. If this be granted, there is no great difficulty in conceiving that the surface of the
interior molten matter might retain that degree of curyature proper to it, as the
resultant of the unknown force with that of gravity and the centrifugal impulse. Moreover, as we must conclude from what we now see going on in South America
and in Scandinavia, that the area affected was large, the difference between the amount
of curvature of the fluid nucleus after the rise in that part of one or two thousand
feet, would be exceedingly small, and its outline scarcely distinguishable from that
of the ocean, and certainly not from that of a sea affected by various tides in confined
channels, which in the case of Glen Roy affords the only standard of comparison.
