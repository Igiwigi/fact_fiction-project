must replace Z”, &”, because the semi-annual replaces the fortnightly tide.

Then if new auxiliary functions ®,, P,, X, be introduced, the whole tide-generating
potential V per unit volume of the earth at the point TE, ry, 77 is given by

I = (70479) (9) &e.

Tf then, as in (10), we pub
e—h=®,+KX,, &., c, -b,=®, +X,, &.,

the equation to the tidally-distorted earth is 9=a+o+0,, where

equivalent to the action of the moon alone. The atellites 1, 2, 3, in fact, give the gemi-diurnal or
$ terms; satellites 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 give the diurnal or & terms; and satellite 10 gives the fortnightly or
X term.

This is analogons to © Garss's way of stating the cirenmstances on which *secnlar* variations in the
elements of the solar system depend ;” and tho analysis was suggested bo me by a passage in 'THoMs0N and
Tarr's *Nat. Phil.,” $ 809, who there refer to the annular gatellite 10. :

It will appear in Section 22 that the 3rd, 8th, and 9th satellites, which are fixed in tho heavens and
which give the sidereal tides, are equivalent to a distribution of bhe moon's mass in the form of a uniform
circular ring coincident with her orbit. And perhaps some other simpler plan might be given which
would replace the other repukive satellites. ,
