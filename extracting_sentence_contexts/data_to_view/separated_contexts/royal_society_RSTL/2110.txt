Deducing the changes of intensity from the times of vibra-
tion,” the observations at 749.6 and- 104” give .00045, and
those at 88*.5 and 104% give .00038 as the decrement in
intensity corresponding to an increment in temperature of
1?, one of the observations being: in the shade, and the other
in the sun_ in-each- case;--but from the observations at 749.6
and '88*.5, where both were; made in the shade, we have
.00061 : and again, from the observations at 90? and 110%.5
(the mean of 1099 and 112?, the times of vibration at these
temperatures being the same,) where both were made in the
sun, we obtain .o0064 as the decrement, the intensity at the
lower temperature being in each case considered as 1, The
small disagreement in the first two results may arise from
errors in determining the temperature of the needle at the
time of vibration, which, from the rapid changes that took

place, could not be ascertained with-precision ; and the much
greater. difference between either of these and the other two
may possibly be attributable to the same source, though shall
have occasion at the conclusion of this paper to'point out
another, and, I conceive, the true cause of this difference. Had-my object been to give a' correction for difference of
temperature, to be applied generally to the intensities de-
duced from the times of vibration, a closer agreement in the
results would have been desirable ; but although such is not
my object, I wish, from these experiments, to- point out the
necessity of such- correction, when we- would deduce the
magnetic intensity from the times of vibration-of a needle in
different parts of the earth, where the temperatures during
the observations are necessarily different. The observations which I have detailed are, I think, quite
conclusive as. establishing the fact, that the rays of the sun
had a tendency to check the vibrations of the needle, parti-
cularly those-in the last table; since here, on the needle
being exposed to the sun, the terminal arc was reduced from
nearly 14* to 82?, and again on excluding its rays that arc
was increased to nearly 18*: the only question is whether
this would take place under all circumstances ; that is, whe-
ther the influence be exerted in all cases directly on a mag-
netised needle and independently of changes in its tempera-
ture and intensity, or whether it was an effect produced on
the metal of the box by a change in its temperature. That
the'effect is independent of changes in the temperature and
intensity of the needle will appear from comparing the first
observation in the sun with the first of the second set in the
shade; the temperatures and times of vibration are very

nearly the same in the. two cases, and yet in the sun the
terminal arc is only 8*, whereas it is 12* go' in the shade. That the diminution of the arc does not arise from an increase
of temperature in the box appears from this, that although
the thermometer indicated 90* at the first observation in the
Sun, and 872 at the first in the shade, it is probable that the
temperature of the brass compass-box was higher in the
latter case than in the former, since in both this would change
its temperature more slowly than the mercury in the bulb of
the thermometer.
