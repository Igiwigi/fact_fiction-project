E The second column of figures shows that as the wedges increased in size there was a
-Zoradual diminution in the thickness of their component lamine—the result partly of
=their mutual pressure impeding the expansion of the vessels to their normal dimensions,
nd partly of the fact that these larger wedges contain more than the average of young
*Slaminee which have been intercalated, and which may not have reached their full
Zdevelopment. In young stems we find that the dimensions of the wedges are somewhat,
Zlarger than those recorded in the above Table.
S On tracing these wedges in such sections as Plate XXII. fig. 3, from their medullary to
Stheir peripheral margins, we find that many of them consist of a single lamina of vessels
Wiironghout their entire course ; but such limited examples rarely, if ever, occur in the
Slarger stems. As shown in fig. 3, e, after proceeding outwards for a little distance, the
V single row of vessels divides into two smaller ones, which in turn become yet further
multiplied i in the thicker stems.
Z 'These vascular lamine are divided from one another by large medullary rays (f'),
which are very conspicuous, even in the transyerse sections, in which they are uſually
Qcomposed of several rows of cells with thin walls running in a radial direction, their
