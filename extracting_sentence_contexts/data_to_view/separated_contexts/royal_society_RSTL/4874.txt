In this instance the difference between what
may be called the nucleate and the granular sporidia is 80 great, that they might at.

"There is another peculiarity connected with this Sphzeria, which is, the existence

each ide, which are not perceptible as long as the sporidia are enclosed in the acne
The fact of these cilia being invisible in the ascus might seem to point to germination

as their origin, but the constancy and regularity in their appearance, Size and position
almost preclude this supposition. L

The above varieties in the sporidia are not,” however, the main peculiarity the

ies are shaped like the spores in the genus Cryptosporium, and if the perithecia pro-
ducing them, had existed singly, or if a number of perithecia in one group had pro-
duced nothing but similar bodies, the plant would have had to be classed with the
Cryptosporia and not with the Sphzriz.
