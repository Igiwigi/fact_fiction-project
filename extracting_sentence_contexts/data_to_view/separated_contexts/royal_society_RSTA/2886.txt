Furthermore, interpreting and applying regulatory standards is
challenging in cases in which an analyst seeks to combine data from multiple sources. In contrast
with regulatory requirements, a formal privacy model like differential privacy offers general
protection and can, in principle, be applied wherever statistical or machine learning analysis is
performed on collections of personal information, regardless of the contextual factors at play. In :
recognition of the fact that a broader notion of personal information must be protected in order :3
to preserve privacy and that information that currently seems innocuous may prove sensitive i
in the future, formal privacy models protect all information specific to an individual, not just : =
information traditionally considered to be identifiable or able to be linked to an individual. 1p

(ii) Scope of attacks contemplated : w

Privacy regulations and related guidance contemplate a limited set of specific attacks and Dy
privacy failure modes. As one example, many regulations make an implicit assumption that : =
re-identification via record linkage—i.e. the re-identification of one or more records in a de- : &
identified dataset by uniquely linking these records with identified records in a publicly available
dataset—is the primary or sole privacy failure mode. Other central concepts appearing in
privacy regulations, including personally identifiable information, (de-)identification, linkage
and inference, are often defined from this point of view.
