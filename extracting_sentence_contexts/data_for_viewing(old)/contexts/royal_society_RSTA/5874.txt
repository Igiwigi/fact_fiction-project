This led Einstein to struggle with the dilemma: there was apparently only one Universe, but an
infinite number of universes, that is unknown solutions to the mathematical equations of general
relativity describing possible models of the Universe; so how could one reconcile the two? Also
how was it possible to control the universes’ behaviour at infinity, if that was allowed elsewhere,
or avoid having a finite edge? A vast field of investigation had just opened.

(b) De Sitter spacetime

Very soon the second universe, solution of the modified Einstein equations with the lambda term,
was found by W. de Sitter [9]. That described an empty (zero matter density) space, static model as
was originally proposed by de Sitter. It was later realized that it may also be described as a model
for an expanding universe in both time directions, because of the negligible effect of gravitational
attraction. In fact, it is constantly accelerating with time due to Einstein’s cosmological constant
term introduced earlier the same year that de Sitter spacetime first appeared.

The de Sitter universe has no beginning or end. This universe plays the role of an ‘undisturbed’
state for the modified Einstein equations with a cosmological term, in a similar way as does
Minkowski space for the original field equations (i.e. with 4 = 0). However, de Sitter space is really
different to Minkowski space in certain quantum aspects, see below. It also plays a fundamental
role as possible asymptotic states of more general homogeneous cosmologies (see later sections
below).

In fact, there are two ‘de Sitter’ spaces, one for A positive—the de Sitter space (dS)—and the
case of negative 4, the so-called anti-de Sitter space (AdS) (see [10] for an excellent discussion of
these spaces, and [11] for a more specialized description of their infinity properties).
