of them the nucleus ultimately projected by about a quarter of its length at one side
& from the black spot, while in the other cell the aggregated molecules covered only one-
a third of the nucleus, so that no part of that body lay in the middle of the mass. The
Z point to which the granules appear to have a special tendency is the middle of the body
of the cell, which seems always to correspond with the centre of the disc of molecules,
= whereas the nucleus is often excentrically placed in the cell.
Mi The diffusion of the molecules is not merely a passive result of the cessation of con-
Scentration, as has been hitherto snpposed. In watching closely the occurrence of the
phenomenon, I have seenf the granules start off suddenly from the central mass, with a
Z velocity which implied that they were under the influence of forces very different from
= those which cause molecular movements in them when shed from their containing cells.
SThat the process requires the vital forces of the cells to be in full operation, is also
'Z proved by the fact, that any agency, such as a galvanic shock, which temporarily para-
= Iyses their functions, arrests diffusion as well as concentration ; whereas, if the former

Srest-.
ij T have already pointed out the sparsely scattered state of the granules in the central
g receptacles, compared with their accumulation in the branches of the offsets, in the fully
& diffused state shown in fig. 3. This contrast is s0metimes much more striking, so that

Sin order to detect them. This indicates a special tendency on the part of the granules
