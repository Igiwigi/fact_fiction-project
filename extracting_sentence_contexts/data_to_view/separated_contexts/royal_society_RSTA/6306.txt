This is a result to a purely combinatorial problem that applies
a probabilistic argument in a surprising way. This single example is most often enough for
human mathematicians to realize a potentially fruitful new tactic; this has indeed turned into
the Probabilistic Method, now widely used in combinatorics. The fact that this tactic stands
out so clearly when one reads about this result poses several puzzling questions. What makes
such a solution so surprising, and certain parts of it especially interesting? Answers for these
questions would help us understand a core notion in the human practice mathematics: not only
some statements are true and some are false but also some are more interesting than others.
