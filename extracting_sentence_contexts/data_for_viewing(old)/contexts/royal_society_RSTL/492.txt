the centre ; for, if the excess of force at any part were commu-
__nicated to the neighbouring particles, there can be no reason
why it should not very s0on be equalised throughout, or, in
other words, become wholly extinct, since the motions in con-
trary directions would naturally destroy each other. The
origin of sound from the vibration of a chord is evidently of
this nature; on the contrary, in a circular wave of water, every
part is at the same instant either elevated or depressed. It may
be difficult to show mathematically, the mode in which this
inequality of force is preserved ; but the inference from the
matter of fact, appears to be unavoidable ; and, while the science
of hydrodynamics is 80 imperfect that we cannot even solve the
Simple problem of the time required to empty a vessel by a
given aperture, it cannot be expected that we should be able to
account perfectly for 80 complicated a series of phenomena, as
those of elastic fluids. The theory of HuyGEexs indeed explains
the circumstance in a manner tolerably satisfactory : he Sup-
poses every particle of the medium to propagate a distinct un-
dulation in all directions; and that the general effect is only
perceptible where a portion of each undulation conspires in
direction at the same instant ; and it is easy to show that suech a
general undulation would in all cases proceed rectilinearly, with
proportionate force; but, upon this supposition, it seems to
