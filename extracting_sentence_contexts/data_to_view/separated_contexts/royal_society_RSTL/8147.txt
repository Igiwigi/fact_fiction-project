The thin layer just named seems to have disappeared during growth, as if it
were an epiderm and was not renewed. In no instance has a trace of a foliar vascular bundle, like those of the Lepidodendra,
been found in the cellular areolz of the bark. This fact alone demonstrates one differ-
ence between these rhomboidal areolz and the leaf-scars of Lepidodendron and Sigillaria ;

* At the Meeting of the British Association in 1871, Mr. Bixxey stated that he had found a yet more peri-
Pheral layer. T have examined 8ome hundreds of these stems, but have een no trace of any thing like what he
there described.
