fibres of the postero-external column owing to the narrowness of the intervening
portion of Gont’s column. As already observed, excitation of the antero-lateral
column with any stimulus less than thrice that adequate for the posterior columns
was without result. It seems, therefore, proper to conclude that the postero-
external column can alone be considered for the purposes of minute localisation as
excitable on its surface as compared with the other column of the cord.

The reason for this probably is, that the postero-external columns are made up
almost entirely of the branches (ascending, descending, and collateral) of the posterior
roots, and that these are at and near the surface of the cord.

(b.) Unilaterality.
In the large majority (91°5 per cent.) of experiments on animals, the fact was

strikingly evident that the movements produced were limited to the side stimulated.
Only in three dogs in thirty-five (8°5 per cent.) could movement be produced in both
legs—i.¢., sides—by stimulating only one side of the spinal cord. That this double
effect was not due to the direct spreading of the current to the posterior column of
the other side was proved in each case by the fact that application of the electrode
to a point or points nearer the middle line and at the same level produced no
movement whatever. In one of the cases the same double result was obtained from
