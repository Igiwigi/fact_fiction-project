Innovation filtering remedies the influx of incompatible traits
into the population and individual repertoires. Contrary to
the model filtering, this limits the introduction of new traits
into the population, while those that are introduced can
spread freely, since transmission is unfiltered. For mostly
incompatible trait pools, the agents in a population share
most of the traits, leading to high similarity, and culture
and repertoire sizes to be almost equal.

Innovation filtering is not as effective as trait filtering at
