Under such circumstances, people preferentially
resort to pantomime, or elements of it, to bootstrap communi-
cation. In instances where these improvised communication
systems (which we term ‘pantomimic fossils’) are used in a
repeated interaction, they can develop language-like character-
istics, possibly recapitulating the evolution of communication
in our phylogeny. In our view, these facts explain why bodily
mimesis and pantomime are not just relics of our evolutionary
past. They have remained with us because they are extremely
powerful tools for facilitating communication in the absence
of a shared language. Authors’ contributions.
