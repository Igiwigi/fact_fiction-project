any immediate secretion of fluid; and the end of the bacterium first enclosed jg
coiled upon itself, sometimes even while the free posterior end, which helps event:
to thicken the coil, lies freely in the pharynx. The process is relatively slow and
occurs 80 rarely that there is some temptation to regard it as a distortion of nol
ingestion; there seems little room for doubt, at least, that the most accep
particles are very minute,—Indian ink suspended in water, the smaller fatty globules
of milk, carmine, also finely divided, and the coagulation precipitate from diluted
white of egg to which I have referred above. j

While, however, it is clear, from these facts, that the ingesta of Carchesium “
made up of particles which vary considerably in size, the connection between this
variation and the fashion of their preliminary accumulation in the gullet is less
evident. The lowest pharyngeal cilia, acting downwards from the annulus which
I have described, beat the solid matter within their reach into the most internal
extremity and then into the body of the cesophageal sac (which may dilate consider.
ably, fig. 5, img.). But the admixture of water, or rather the medium in which the
animal is living, is the feature which varies in prominence with some apparent eccen-
tricity. On the whole, irregular particles, and especially nutritious particles, lie in a
very fluid vacuole of ingestion. Exceptions to both these statements occur, however;
thus, minute bacteria have sometimes but scanty fluid surroundings, and the grains
of Indian ink may be gathered so closely that the accompanying fluid is h
appreciable, or may, on the contrary, lie in a vacuole so well marked that Browni
