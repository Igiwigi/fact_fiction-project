[Norr.—Added May 25, 1898. One point ought to have been more fully dealt with
in the above memoir, namely, the probable error of the criterion «= 6 + 38, — 28,,
upon which the selection of the type of the frequency depends, Clearly, if the
probable error of this criterion is as large as the criterion itself, there can be no
stability of type, or the frequency may change over from one type to another,

On page 289 we have found the standard deviation of the criterion in terms of
known quantities for the curve
