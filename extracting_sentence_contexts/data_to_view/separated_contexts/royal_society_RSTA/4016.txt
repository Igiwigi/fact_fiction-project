Introduction

Even though the surface of the Earth is made up of about 70% water, only 2.5% of this is fresh
water that is fit for human use. The majority of this fresh water is tied up in glaciers or is deep
underground [1]. Water shortage is currently an ongoing global concern, which is reflected in the
fact that water scarcity is one of the United Nationsâ€™ Millennium Development Goals [2]. It is
imperative that this water need is addressed and, with a growing global population, novel ideas
must be explored. Dew, fog and rainwater collection has taken place for hundreds of years, but
to date only minimum information based on nature has been used to inform the design of such
harvesting devices.
