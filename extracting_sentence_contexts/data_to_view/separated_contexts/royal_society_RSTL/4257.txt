BRODIE ON MYRICIN.

combination with this unctuous acid, the presence of which is very probably due to
another source. This alcohol may possibly, as well as the melissin, be combined with palmitic acid,
or it may be in some altogether different form in the wax. Even after long boiling
with alcohol, the myricin has a slight wax smell, and it is possible that this unctuous
acid is the product of the action of potash upon the oil which is one of the con-
stitnents of the wax, and from which I have in fact procured an acid of this nature. This oil, or rather grease, which was analysed by Lewr, is a yery curious substance. The other constituents of the wax are, in a pure state, inodorous and crystalline,
and to it the wax owes its tenacity and peculiar smell.
