N. HILL ON SEISMIC REFRACTION SHOOTING

no evidence for multiple refractions was obtained. These two facts indicate that in the
western Atlantic where these experiments were carried out the consolidation with depth
is less gradual than in our area.

5:2. The phases arriving before the direct sound

The phases which arrive before the direct sound represent paths passing along the
interface beolw the sediments except for one point which is of great importance in con-
firming the sedimentary structure obtained from the multiple refractions discussed above. This point, which was obtained from the closest shot of station 2, represents an arrival
passing along the layer of constant velocity which it was concluded must exist below the
region where there was a linear increase of velocity with depth.
