view of the small thickness of the layers involved, and also in view of the fact that sensitization
persists on cooling and then re-heating.

Discussion

(i) The greater volume of initiator required for ‘build-up’ with mercury fulminate gives
some explanation why mercury fulminate is much less sensitive to grit than lead azide. From
the experimental conditions, the hot spots formed by rubbing grit on a hard surface are very
local. Unless detonation can build up from a very small local disturbance, no special sensi-
tization by grit is to be expected.

Two interesting points arise. In the first place, the usefulness of Service azide lies precisely
in the fact that it builds up to complete detonation in very small volumes. Any attempt to
preserve this property of an initiator has almost inevitably the concomitant of a high grit
sensitiveness, if the proposed theory of grit sensitiveness is correct. Secondly the heat of
explosion/g. of lead azide and mercury fulminate are stated to be (Escales & Stettbacher
1917) .

mercury fulminate 410cal./g. lead azide 364 cal./g.
so that the better build-up with lead azide must be due to the chain mechanism of its decom-
position, and not to a greater heat of reaction.

(ii) The results for the percussion sensitiveness of lead azide could be explained if, say
20°% of the detonations on percussion started from thermal hot spots, and the rest from
a mechanical process not affected by preheating of the crystals. This would agree with the
