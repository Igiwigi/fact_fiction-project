6. Conclusion

We have developed a novel method to build a hybrid model consisting of a physics-based
truncated model and a data-driven model of the unresolved processes. The approach is based
on realistic assumptions that only noisy and incomplete observations are available at a lower
frequency than the model integration time step.

With a two-scale low-order chaotic system [28], we showed that the hybrid model forecast skill
is sensitive to the observation frequency but very robust against high observational noise and
sparse spatial distribution. This is probably due to the fact that reduced observations frequencies
challenge the validity of the linear superposition assumption more than large observational noise
(see the discussion in Appendix of [40]). We then applied the method to the low-order coupled
ocean-atmosphere model MAOOAM [35] which contains multiple temporal scales. Forecast
skill and global statistics were significantly improved by the hybrid model compared with the
truncated model encouraging further studies in high-dimensional and more realistic scenarios.
Notably, the hybrid model derived from noisy observations has comparable forecast skill on the
oceanic variables to that of the hybrid model derived from perfect observations.

In view of operational systems, it should be noted that the proposed algorithm relies on two
existing DA and NNs training techniques that both scale well to high-dimensions (e.g. [41,42]).
In principle, the present algorithm can be applied to larger and more realistic problems. In
particular, the fact that the method does not rely on the adjoint of the truncated model is an
