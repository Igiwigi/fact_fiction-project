Figure 4. Comparisons of key petrotectonic indicators for plate tectonics and timings of major glacial episodes (vertical blue a)
regions) spanning the last 3Ga, modified from Stern & Miller [61]. (a) Ophiolites provide evidence of seafloor spreading, : ~
subduction initiation and horizontal motions consistent with plate tectonics (seafloor spreading and subduction initiation 7
proxy). (b) Indicators of subduction zone metamorphism—blueschists, glaucophane-bearing eclogites, lawsonite-bearing [et
metamorphic rocks and jadeitites—form only in the cool, fluid-rich environments in and above subduction zones (subduction 7B
proxies). (c) UHP metamorphic rocks and the gemstone ruby proxy continental collision and deep subduction of continental : S
crust (continental collision proxies). Modified after Stern et a/. [62]. (Online version in colour.) fa

uncovered by erosion and are difficult to obliterate. The fact that the multiple lines of evidence
shown in figure 4 agree indicates that preservation bias is not a serious concern for the Archaean
and Proterozoic record.

Palaeomagnetic evidence is potentially a key constraint but becomes less reliable with
age [64]. Critical evaluation of this line of evidence for the purposes of understanding when
palaeomagnetic constraints are robust and when they are not, and, on this basis, what the
palaeomagnetic evidence says about when cratons moved relative to each other (=plate tectonic
episodes) and when they did not (single lid), will require dedicated syntheses by members of the
practising palaeomagnetic community.

The absence of ophiolites, blueschist and UHP terranes for approximately 800 Ma—
approximately the time of the ‘boring billion’ or Earth’s middle age [40]—provides further
