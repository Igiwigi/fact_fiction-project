One great source (if not, the only one) for the unknown residual phenomena thus
distinctly indicated by Horxixs we hope presently to point out, and to prove its inti-
mate connexion with existing volcanic phenomena. 45. Our present knowledge of hypogeal temperature, while thus and s0 far insufficient
to snstain any very minute conclusions based upon annual absolute loss of heat by
our earth, seems surely to support the fact that our earth is a cooling globe ; while
astronomical analogies and considerations of its figure seem equally to warrant
the presumption that it has been a cooling globe at all times from a state of fusion ;
and if 80, that from that period and up to the present it has been on the whole
a contracting globe. These are all the conditions we require to admit for the conclusions to be obtained
by considering the sequence of the phenomena that have followed on refrigeration. 44.
