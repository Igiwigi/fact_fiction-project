ponding position to those of Loris, but (so far as one can judge from an oocyte in
process of growth, and after a long sojourn in formalin) in less abundance (PI. 1, fig. 2),
a very interesting point of agreement between the Lemuroid and the Tarsioid. On
the other hand, fat-globules comparable with those of Loris are apparently not present
in the oocytes of the Platyrrhine, Hapale jacchus, which I have been able to examine
(fig. 3) and are definitely absent from those of the Catarrhine, Macacus rhesus (fig. 4),

just as they are absent in the Human ovum, so that it would seem that a reduction in
the deutoplasmic content of the egg has taken place in the passage from the lower to
the higher Primates. Having established these facts, the question arose, is this
reduction in the amount of deutoplasm accompanied by any appreciable diminution
in the size of the oocyte in the higher types? Unfortunately the available data are
not sufficient, in view of the well-known variation in the size of the ovum in one and
the same species, to provide a conclusive answer to this question, but so far as the
measurements set forth in the accompanying table go, they tend rather to emphasize
a striking and unexpected general agreement in the size of the ovum in the Primate
series, though we still stand in need of accurate records of the size of the full-grown
Human oocyte.*
