These fundamental principles must therefore be looked upon as
hypotheses introduced into algebra in order to give to negative quantities a
representation and a real existence. And in like manner, in order to arrive at
the representation of the square roots of negative quantities, I have made the
following hypotheses : that all straight lines drawn in a given plane from a
given point in any direction whatever, may be algehraically represented both
in length and direction: that addition is performed in the same manner as
composition of motion in dynamics; that four straight lines are proportionals,
both in length and direction, when they are proportionals in length, and the
fourth is inclined to the third at the same angle at which the second is inclined
to the first : and I have by means of these hypotheses as a foundation, esta-
blished all the common rules for performing algebraic operations, and thus
have proved, that the results arrived at by means of these hypotheses mnst be
correct : therefore I conclude, that these are true hypotheses, and true in the
same sense, that the hypotheses made by algebraists respecting the represen-
tation of negative quantities are true. In fact, if there be a _question, whether
negative quantities can or cannot be represented geometrically ; the only way
in which such a question can be solved, is by making certain hypotheses with
respect to their geometric representation, and then showing that the results
arrived at from these hypotheses must be correct: and in like manner if there
be a question whether those quantities commonly called impossible can be
geometrically represented, the question must be solved in the same way ; viz.
by making certain hypotheses. respecting them, and showing that the results
arrived at by means of these hypotheses must be correct. In this point of view,
the definitions and fundamental principles which I have laid down in my
treatise must be considered as mere hypotheses ; and mathematicians will be
satisfied of their correctness when they see that the results agree in every re-
spect with the results obtained by other independent processes.
