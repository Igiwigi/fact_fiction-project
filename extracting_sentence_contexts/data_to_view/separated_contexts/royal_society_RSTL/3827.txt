These additional

equally new and important. In the whole of the Myriapoda and Arachnida a distinet
circulation of the blood is carried on in vessels ; and snch also is the case in insects
and other Articulata. These structures are less perfect in the earliest condition or
larva state of the animal in each of these classes, in which many of the structures are
Still in the course of formation, more especially in those species which undergo a true
metamorphosis, as in insects.
