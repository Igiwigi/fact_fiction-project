Hence a = 0 is the only integral root. Lastly, for the classes (15) and (24)
1—e—c—e—c+1=0,

and for the classes (3?)and (24)
1+1+1—¢+4 2+ 2+ 2+ 2%+1—ce+14+1=0.

Hence
3Be+e=2
— 6e= 6
e=-—l1

The table may now be completed. Another fact that may be useful in completing the table, is the following. If two
classes are similar, save that operations of the one class contain a cycle of order p, and the
corresponding operations of the other class leaves the p symbols unaltered, then, p being
prime, the characteristics of the two classes are congruent mod. p.
