and (observing that the Table of Singularities in my Memoir on Cubic Surfaces was
obtained without the aid of the formula now in question) I endeayour by means of the
results therein contained to find the values of the unknown coefficients h, 9, a, A, þ, Y,
W,g,s,N, pv.
60. For a cubic surface n=3, and for a cubic snrface without singular lines (in fact
for all the cases except the cubic scrolls XXII and XXHT), the formula is
B'=54—hC—gB—N—w$,—I/8—KC'—gB);
and applying this to the seyeral cases of cubic surfaces as grouped together in the Table,
and referred to by the affixed roman numbers, the resulting equations are
