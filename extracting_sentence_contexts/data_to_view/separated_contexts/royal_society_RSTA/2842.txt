The size
requirements imposed by ASTM E399 is relevant to high strength metals. ASTM E399 has no
established relevance to any type of ice. Almost every usage of LEFM and the Kj, fracture toughness notation in the ice literature
indicates ignorance of the fact that LEFM may well not be applicable and that there is no fracture
testing standard for any type of ice. One is reminded again and again of the quote: ‘The greater
the ignorance the greater the dogmatism’ [12]. During this ill-advised one-parameter fracture mechanics ice odyssey, it has been implicitly
assumed that the way a tensile fracture grows in sea ice is universal, from cracks small to large.
