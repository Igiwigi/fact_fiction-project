F It appears rather doubtful whether this small correction (which only amounts at most to x45 of the whole
heating-effect) should have been made at all, as from 8ubsequent experiment the deviations in different parts
of the scale were found to be very nearly identical with the same heating-ecffect ; in fact the difference was less
than the probable error of observation.

+ Strictly speaking this correction should have been applied to each single reading, not to the mean of a set
of readings, as was done to saye labour. :
