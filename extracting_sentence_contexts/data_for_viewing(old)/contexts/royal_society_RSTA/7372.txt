our area and the coast of Ireland.

To the south of the area where the water deepens to 1500 fm. (2700 m) and more there
are indications on the Admiralty charts of globigerina ooze, but between the 1000 fm.
(1800 m) and 1500 fm. (2700 m) contours the charts show mud, sand and clay. It is
possible that the existence of the coarser material can be explained by transportation
from the relatively shallow water area to the north-east.

The unconsolidated sedimentary layer thickness is greater than has been found by
Ewing (1950) in the north-western Atlantic Ocean Basin. In a depth of 2800 fm. (5100 m)
and with the assumption of a uniform velocity of 5600 ft./s (1-7 km/s) he calculates a
thickness of 4500 ft. (1370 m). It would seem possible that this thickness should be in-
creased because of the fact that no allowance has been made for the increase of velocity
with depth. .

If this layer does not represent undisturbed deep-sea sediments, then the most probable
explanation of its origin is that it represents the seaward edge of a continental shelf
shallowing to the north-eastwards which has been subsequently downwarped. The thick-
ness is consistent with the seismic measurements made on the European (Bullard &
Gaskell 1941) and eastern United States (Ewing et al. 1937, 1939, 1940, 19500) continental
shelves. Any attempts, through this hypothesis, to decide on the position of the continental
mass providing the sediments will not be possible until further experimental results are
available.
