As there are two quantities to be determined, a single arc is not
suflicient to enable us to find them, unless the lengths and amplitudes of portions of
the arc, as well as of the whole, are known. BessEL, in a paper which bas been
translated in vol. ii. of TayLor's *© Scientific Memoirs,” has shown from ten arcs
measured on various parts of the earth and from portions of five of them, by an appli-

cation of the principle of least squares, that the mean ellipticity =507 and that

the semi-axis major =3271953-854 toises, the length of the toise being to that of the
fathom as 106576542 : 1. This result coincides almost exactly with the ellipticity
which theory assigns, upon the snpposition that the earth was once a fluid mass, its
strata increasing in density from the surface to the centre, the density of the surface
being that of granite, and the mean density being 53rds that of water—a fact which
is generally considered to be a strong argument in fayour of the original fluidity of
the earth's mass.

all merged in the mean result. When the calculations for the separate arcs are exa-
mined, the values are found to vary on either side of the mean.
