The direct measurement of blood pressure in the heart vessels provides the
applanation tonometry [26] as well as the angiocatheter insertion [27] that is often used for
invasive calculation of an FFR (fractional functional reserve) of the damaged artery. It is worth
emphasizing the importance of these methods for obtaining patient-specific boundary conditions,
which makes the CFD simulation as realistic as possible. In fact, the overwhelming majority of CAD patients are examined using a relatively
simple and cheap but affordable method of X-ray contrast angiography. This method provides
good visualization of the coronary tree and implies the opportunity of positioning miniature
pressure transducers in large coronary arteries. To reduce the radiation dose to the patient and
the physician, the diagnostic procedure minimizes the number of heart projections and any
measurements.
