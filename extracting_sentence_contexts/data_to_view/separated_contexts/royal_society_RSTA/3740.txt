of the temperature of the
radiator if we take the temperature of the enclosure as the zero of our scale. The same ratio experimentally determined is about 6 per cent. This relatively
low value is accounted for by the fact that each gaseous particle does not only part
with its heat to the succeeding one, but streaming upwards, comes sooner or later in

contact with the upper wall of the enclosure. A Numerical Comparison of the Heat dissipated by Conductivity in Solids and
by Emissivity in Gases. Let us now consider the numerical values of the total emissivity obtained at high
pressures.
