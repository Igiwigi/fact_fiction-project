3. Thermodynamics of composite systems

Following conventional stochastic thermodynamics, I identify the (expected) global EF rate at
time f as

(Q(t) = LEG Ape () In 53 ae 3 (3.1)
x, LEO (v;t)
= Leet) 7 pe, On aeons (3.2)

» Xp XPO)

The results below do not require LDB. However, if all reservoirs are purely thermal, with
no associated particle exchange, and if LDB applies, then we can interpret the EF rate as
(temperature-normalized) heat flow between the system and its reservoirs.”

Similarly, the (expected) global EP rate at time f is

Ly (u; tpx(t)

(6() = py LX (v; f)py(£) In wpe) (3.3)
C LE (v4 Pees oO

7To see this, first use the fact that for every unit w in any unit structure, whether that unit structure is tight or not, w C L(w). Then note that if @ C £(w), at least one reservoir in £(w) would violate the requirement that the unit structure be tight.

5To see this, first note that —w C P(—w), since any set is contained in the associated puppet set. In addition, if there were
coordinates i ¢ P(—w) that lay inside w for some reservoir v, then there would be a coordinate j € —w such that P(v) contains
both jand j.
