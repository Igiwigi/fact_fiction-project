25. The determination of the signs has been made by means of the particular figure ;
but it is easy to see that the pairs of terms could not for instance be dS —dS,, dS, —dS,
dS,—dS,, dS,—dS, or any other pairs such that it would be possible to eliminate
dS, dS,, dS,, dS,, and thus obtain an equation such as

Pdo+:P,da, +:,P,de,+:,P,do,=0;
this would, by virtue of the relations between ds, de,, de,, dw,, become

an equation not deducible from the relations which connect @, @,, ,, @,, and which
therefore cannot be satisfied by the variable quadrilateral.
26. The differentials of the formulz are, it will be observed, of the form Pd»

which is, in fact, the same as Casry's form in © (equation (300), his © being =90*—a). Writing as before v in place of his 0, the differential expression becomes simply =3 dv:
