And it is this very principle, together with the lens-like form of the axes
which produces in transverse section of an Eupsammid septum the appearance of an
inner and outer septal deposit on both sides of the mid-line. No doubt this kind of
appearance gave rise to the idea ofa four-leaved septum held by some paleontologists. But these are appearances shown only by particular sections, and owe their explana-
tion to the facts I have just indicated. If I were to go on appearances, I might say all septa in which the trabecular axes
are lens-like in shape and close together, appear to be at least two-leaved in
transverse sections, in some cases four-leaved, Whereas all septa in which the
trabecular axes are thread-like or rod-like in shape, and are not very close, appear
to be a single-leaf in transverse section, in some cases three-leaved (i.c., where the
deposit near the origin of fascicles differs in its crystalline setting from the deposit
more remote). But these appearances cannot lead with any security to a systematic
analysis of corals.
