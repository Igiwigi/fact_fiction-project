I have said that, within the » distance, the crystal of sulphate of iron pointed
more or less obliquely (2616.) ; I will now state more particularly what the ciream-
stances are. If the distance x be s0 adjusted, that the prismatic crystal, which is at
the time between the magnetic poles, shall make an angle of 30* (or any quantity)
with the axial line; then it will be found that there is another stable position,
namely, the diametral position (2461.), in which it can stand ; but that the obliquity

is always on the same side of the axial line ; and that the crystal will not stand with
the like obliquity of 30* on the opposite side of the magnetic axis.

2635. If the crystal be turned 180* round a vertical axis, or end for end, then the
inclination, and the direction in which it occurs, remain unchanged ; in fact, it is
simply giving the crystal the diametral position. But if the crystal be revolyed 180?
round a horizontal axis; either that coinciding with its length, which represents its
maximum magnetic direction ; or that corresponding with its breadth, and therefore
with the magnecrystallic axis; then the inclination is the same in amount as before,
but it is on the other side of the axial line.

2636. This is the case with all the prismatic crystals of sulphate of iron which I
have tried.
