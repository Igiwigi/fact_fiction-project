CONFORMAL TRANSFORMATION TO PROBLEMS IN HYDRODYNAMICS. 451

It must be remembered, however, that this transformation has been constructed
solely with a view to the angular configuration, and that it affords no guarantee that
the stream-lines corresponding respectively to w > c¢ and w <—c will not be merely
parallel instead of being in the same straight line. There is, in fact, the possibility of a configuration of the character indicated in
fig. 4, and it must now be shown that this possibility can be provided against by a
suitable adjustment of the parameter /. 16.
