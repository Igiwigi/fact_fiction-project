Sonly) continued long enough for the purpose,

Sas the cobalt if they were sought for; and also that this quality of charge may affect
the npsetting angle of pieces of metal differing in their proportions of length and
Zthickness (3426.).
S 83428, Admitting all the effect of this charge, there is still another result evident
Ein both the cobalt series, and in both parts of the series O; that is, the increase of
iS! power with elevation of temperature. This is, I believe, the first instance in which
Ssuch a result has been recognized; and even though we might think for a moment
= that, whilst ascending from 66? to 300?, the higher temperatures had set the metal
E adv free to give up adverse charge, as above supposed (3426.), still that would not
account on descending for a diminution of force, without admitting that heat was
also able to make the metal more favourable to receive charge ; which is in fact to
say that the power is greater at higher than at lower temperatures. This effect
cannot depend upon any change in the surrounding medium, for, snch is the enormous
disproportion between it and the cobalt in equal volumes, that if its powers were
either annibilated or doubled, the effect would be insensible amongst the results.
If 8uch be the truth with cobalt, then it is probable that a like result would occur
with iron and nickel at some temperatures, and that in passing to lower temperatures
than those employed we should arrive at one presenting the maximum magnetic
induction for each, and below which their inductive force would diminish, Within
