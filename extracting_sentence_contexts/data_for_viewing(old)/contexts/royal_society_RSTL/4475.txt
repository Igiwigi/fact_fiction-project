admitted by all who do not believe in the identity of these two agents. The disproof
of their identity will be found, the author believes, in the numerous experiments of
Prof. Marrevecr and others, who have failed to procure any manifestations of a
change in the electric state of nerves, through whose agency muscular contractions
were being most vigorously excited ; and in the well-known fact, that the conduction
of nervous force is prevented by pressure on the nerve-trunk, or by other disorgan-
izing changes, which do not impair its power of conducting electricity. All the facts
which have been adduced in support of the identity of these two forces will be found
readily explicable on the idea of their © correlation” or mutual convertibility ;—elec-
tricity, when acting through nerve-fibres, developing nervous force; and nervye-force,
when operating upon a certain special form of apparatus, developing electricity.
This view the author purposes now to unfold in more detail; adducing in support of
it facts which are s0 well known to physiologists and electricians, that there can be
no occasion to do more than cite them.

1. If an electric current be made to traverse the trunk of a motor nerve for a short
distance only, it will produce contraction of the muscles which are supplied from its
branches. It was formerly supposed that the contraction was excited by the imme-
diate action of the electricity upon the muscles ; but it has been clearly proved that
the electric current need not proceed to them, its passage along the trunk for a very
short distance being sufficient to develope the neryous force in its branches.

2. In like manner, if the electric current be passed for a short distance only along
a sensory nerve, it will excite in the sensorium the peculiar sensations ordinarily
produced by impressions conveyed through that nerve ; that is to say, the ordinary
