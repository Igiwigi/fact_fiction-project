One other corpus luteum in this pair of ovaries was, equally obviously,
newer than the others, and it too was evidently formed by ovulation. The remaining four corpora lutea of E130 were intermediate in age and indistinguishable
from each other histologically. They must, in fact, have been formed at approximately the
same time, and under a single endocrine stimulus. Two of them were evidently formed
from follicles which ovulated. These several corpora lutea are represented diagrammatically
in figure 7c, and some of them can be seen in the photographs in figures 17a, db.
