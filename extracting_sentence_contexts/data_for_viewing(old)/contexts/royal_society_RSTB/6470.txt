Haercket (1860), Greerr (1872), Horrmann (1872), and other earlier workers
regarded the droplets within the cup as lenses, but they have subsequently been
shown not to be of a lenticular nature. HAMANN (1883) and Cuénor (1887) do not
figure any special lenticular structure in the optic cup. Prerrer (1901), however,
shows that the hyaline thickening, of ectodermal origin, which covers the mouth of
the cup must be regarded as a lens, an observation I have been able to confirm.

Cutnort’s account differs from that of all other workers in respect to the cuticle
which, he says, “ descend jusque dans les godets oculaires qu’elle revét complete-
ment”. My sections of the optic cushion of Marthasterias glacialis show, on the
contrary, that the epithelial cells of the optic cup have no cuticular lining resulting
from an invagination of the cuticle ; the latter, in fact, is entirely superficial in
position. Finally, there remains for consideration the histology of the cells which
line the optic cup. Briefly stated, there are two divergent views as to the nature of
these elements of ectodermal origin. HAMANN (1883) finds in the cup both pigmented
and sensory cells. The former, of the nature of epithelial cells, have their inner ends
produced as a long fibre which, extending through the underlying fibrillar zone,
terminates on the basal connective tissue layer, while the latter have a central fibre
which merges with the fibrillae of the subepithelial plexus. Prerrer (1901), on the
other hand, is of the opinion that the cup is lined by cells which are pigmented and
are also sensory in function, 7.e., there is only a single type of cell. He says, “ Die
Sonderung in Pigment- und Stabchenzellen ist eben bei der Retina des Seesternauges
nicht durchgefiihrt, so dass hier die Retinazellen die Funktion der Ausscheidung
einer Hiihle sowohl als auch die Funktion der Stabchenzellen iibernehmen miissen,
