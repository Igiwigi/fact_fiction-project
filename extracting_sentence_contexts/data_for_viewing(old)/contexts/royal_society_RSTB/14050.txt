nearly recessive (main plot) and additive alleles (inset). All
results are from allele frequency simulations (assuming LE
and zero inbreeding). Dashed vertical lines indicate the

threshold 2LU above which metastable populations (with
N.=1â€”E[R,|N-]>0) cannot exist (even for large roK).

We find that extinction times increase with increasing K for
all parameters. However, for parameter combinations that cor-
respond to extinction in the large rpK limit (i.e. to the right of the
dashed lines), this increase is approximately linear in K, while
for parameters leading to metastability in the large roK limit
(left of dashed lines), this increase is faster than linear. In fact,
in the metastable regime, even with a carrying capacity K of a
few thousand individuals, demographic stochasticity will be
sufficiently weak and extinction times large enough that isolated
populations can persist over geological timescales: for these
parameter regimes, it is environmental fluctuations (which our
model ignores), rather than mutation load or demographic
stochasticity, that will primarily influence extinction risk.

We also compute the average (scaled) population size N =
n/K in the metastable state (figure 1c). This declines with
increasing 2LU, i.e. as we approach the threshold for loss of
metastability, and is close to the semi-deterministic prediction
