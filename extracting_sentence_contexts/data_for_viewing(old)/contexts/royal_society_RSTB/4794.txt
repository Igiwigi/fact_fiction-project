text-fig. 3 (below), which with the help of the account given above, will enable him to
form an idea of the range of variation exhibited by the medullary xylem, both as regards
distribution and extent of development. ‘This diagram should, however, be regarded as
only a generalized sketch, combined of several observed cases, rather than as representing
a typical specimen: such an extensive development of medullary xylem as that shown
in the sketch is the exception rather than the rule.

From the foregoing account it may be concluded that the presence of medullary xylen
in the proximal part of the aerial shoot is a normal and characteristic feature of Tm.
Vieillardi, and the variability of the tissue in this species, while it is entirely absent in the
other forms, strongly suggests that even here it is onits way to extinction. The absence
of protoxylem indicates that the medullary xylem represents only the cauline part of the
stele and has nothing to do with leaf-traces ; this is also shown by the fact that at their
distal ends the medullary strands as a rule terminate blindly in the pith.

From an examination of a large number of sections containing medullary xylem it
emerges that in a general way the quantity of the medullary xylem and its distribution
(whether consolidated or scattered) roughly follows the total diameter of the stem. ‘Thus,
the section shown in fig. 2 6, with well-developed and scattered medullary xylem, was in
total diameter more than twice as large as that in fig. 2 f,* in which only a single medullary
strand is seen. ‘That this rule does not always apply is, however, seen on comparing
fig. 2¢ in which the diameter of the stem was 1% as great as in fig. 2f, but which
actually carries a smaller medullary strand. Similarly, the section photographed in
Plate 5, fig. 11 (devoid of medullary xylem) is very nearly equal to that in Plate 5,
fig. 13, and almost 14 times that in fig. 2 f, both of which possess medullary xylem.
