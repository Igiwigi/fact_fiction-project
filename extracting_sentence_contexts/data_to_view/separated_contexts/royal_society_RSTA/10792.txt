Mr, ApAM SEDGWICK may be right in his view* that in the early stages of evolution
variability is large and inheritance small, and that with development this relation is
changed, variability decreasing with an increasing intensity of heredity. My
statistics only cover a small portion of one kingdom. But so far as I am aware
they represent the only material so far published on which a definite judgment can be
founded—where by definite judgment, I mean one based on quantitative facts, and
not drawn from a general estimate of nature which makes no statement whatever
of the intensity of either variability or heredity for any single character in any one
species of living things. The data I have given seem entirely opposed to Mr. Sepe¢wick’s view, but I very
fully realise that they are far from exhaustive.
