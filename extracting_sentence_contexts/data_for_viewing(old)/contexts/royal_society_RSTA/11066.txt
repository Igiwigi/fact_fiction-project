increased to 6 vols. in 51 of water, the disturbance set up was still extremely similar,
as will be seen by comparing the figures of Sheet 9, which represent the splash of a
smooth serpentine sphere in the glycerine mixture at the heights specified, with the
corresponding figures in the case of water, Sheet 4, Series XIV. and XVI. The only
noticeable difference is the rather greater salience of the ribs in some of the glycerine
figures, and the greater reluctance in the jets to segment into droplets.

We then experimented with pure glycerine. Series XXVI. of Sheet 10, reproduced
in part on page 196, gives the splash in pure glycerine of the same polished serpentine
sphere, 25Â°7 centims. in diameter, falling 75 centims. In all cases the radial ribs are
seen in the negatives of the photographs to be very pronounced. Even at so early a
stage as fig. 1 the fluting is well developed. The two photographs taken of stage 3
had each of them an isolated jet, probably owing to the fact that when working with
so sticky a liquid it was difficult to avoid contaminating the cloth on which the sphere
was each time re-polished after washing in water, with the result that the sphere
behaved as if locally rough. The relatively great length of this jet brings out very
well the part played by the viscous drag in hindering the flow of that portion of the
liquid sheath which has remained in contact with the sphere. In the last figure
No. 4, of this series the droplets just visible in the centre, below the level of the

general surface, correspond to those of figs. 6 and 7 of Series XIII. at a much higher
