The
pachytene chromosome at this magnification measures 102 mm., while the leptotene
specimen measures 155 mm. This is a ratio of approximately 100 : 150.*

Whilst all allowance must be made for the undesirability of using a unique specimen
as evidence, it is still difficult to resist the conclusion that the testimony of these
photographs is trustworthy. All obvious objections have been examined carefully and
will be considered in the discussion, but no facts have so far been found which could
be interpreted as incompatible with the above results. Whilst recognizing that further
confirmation is desirable the measurements will therefore be provisionally accepted. But this result, if true, leads to some very important conclusions.
