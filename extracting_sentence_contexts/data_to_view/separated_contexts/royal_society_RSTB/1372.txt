Photograph 2 shows one of the ‘lenticular organs,”
Band one of the leaf-traces, which is especially clear. These facts demonstrate that
‘othe section passes through a node, and therefore that the axis is a stem. This
Sconclusion is further strengthened by the fact that immediately above the node we
‘find the base of a branch fgivohabby abortive) which is thus in the normal position for
&branches of the stem of Calamites.t
% This specimen may therefore safely be regarded as affording additional evidence
that organs with “ Astromyelon” structure, were borne on Calamitean stems. © The nature of the organs hitherto known under the name of Astromyelon, is now
Es far established that we know them to have been appendages of the stem of
¥ Calamites (Arthropitys of the French authors).
