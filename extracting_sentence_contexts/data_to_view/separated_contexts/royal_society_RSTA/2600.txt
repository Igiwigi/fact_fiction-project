The time occupied in the passage from one thermo-junction to the other,
at the slowest rate of flow, was only a fraction of a second. The thermo-junctions were connected to the selector switch (p. 85) in such a way
that the temperature of either junction, or the difference between the two, could be
measured, The latter arrangement was convenient, since it was the difference of
temperature which was being investigated. Before using the new apparatus tests were made to ascertain whether the heat
insulation was in fact perfect, and also what difference, if any, there was between the
readings of temperature given by the two thermo-junctions. The construction of the
apparatus makes these tests very simple. To avoid the slightest drop of pressure between the thermo-junctions, a simple full-
bore block of vuleanite (also shown in fig.
