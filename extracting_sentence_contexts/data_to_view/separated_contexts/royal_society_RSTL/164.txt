It is clear that these white fumes contain -mercury : they
may be wholly condensed in a range of WovuLFe's apparatus,
charged with a solution of muriate of ammoniac. When the
operation is over, a white. powder is seen floating-with ether
on the saline liquor, which,” if the bottles are agitated; vis
entirely dissolved. - After the mixture has been boiled, or for
some time exposed to the #tmosphere,/it yields to-caustic'ammo-
niac a precipitate, in all respects similarto that which is sepa-
rated by caustic ammoniac from corrosive sublimate. I would infer from these facts, that the white dense fumes
consist of mercury, or perhaps. oxide of mercury, united'to the
nitrous etherized gas; and that, when the muriate of ammoniac
containing them is exposed to the: atmosphere, or is boiled, the
gas separates from the mercury; and the excess of nitrous acid,
which always comes: over with nitrous ether, decomposes the
ammoniacal muriate, and forms corrosive mercurial muriate or
8ublimate, This theory is corroborated, by comparing the quan-
tity of gas estimated to be contained in the fulminating mercury,
with the quantities of gas yielded from alcohol and nitrous acid,
with and without mercury in solution; not to mention that
more ether, as well as more gas, is produced without the inter-

the product of ether, is always in the inverse ratio to the pro-
duct of nitrous etherized gas.
