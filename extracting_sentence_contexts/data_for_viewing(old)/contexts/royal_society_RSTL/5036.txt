arteries, as stated by Cuvigr. It is pellucid, a little less 80 than distilled water. It
possesses, in the highest degree, the property of coagulating. In this respect it
strikingly differs from the chylaqueous fluid of the Annelida, which was remarked
to be gifted in a minimum degree with the clot-forming faculty. Physiology will
hereafter inevitably prove, that between the coagulating property and the structure
and number of the floating cells, there exists a relation of proportion which is yet
unresolved. The blood-corpuscles of the Whelk and Limpet (figs. 73, 74, 75) fall
under the description now given. The Cephalopods constitute the climax of the
molluscan $eries: this observation is alike true of the solids and the fluids. Like
that of other Mollusks, bluish and colourless, the blood of the Cephalopods is rich
in floating cells; of more determinate and elaborate formation, however, than those
of other Mollusks. "They present far more striking uniformity in size and form than
anything observed among the inferior molluscan families. In this fact they exhibit
a near approximation to the vertebrate type of blood-corpuscle. These are signs of
superior organization. They are provided always with a nucleus, Situated for the

most part centrally, but sometimes peripherally. The space between the nucleus and
involucrum is filled with a light bluish fluid, thickly impregnated with point-like
molecules, and here and there a larger oil-cell. Another variety of cell, wholly
destitute of contents, may be remarked (fig. 80); these latter are probably the germ
State of the former. Between these intermediate forms may be observed. The
mature cells preserve a striking regularity of size and structure; they are invariably
