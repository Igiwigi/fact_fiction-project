process which may be regarded as specially human. A reduced prognathism might

be expected to follow as a natural consequence of the restricted function of the
human jaw, for in a lever of the third order, such as the jaw, a definite advantage
accompanies the approximation of the points of application of the power and the
load. Thus it is far more remarkable that the negroes should possess a high degree
of prognathism than that the white man should possess scarcely any.

In view of these facts and considering the wide interval which separates
Neandertal man from the apes, it cannot be asserted that the almost orthognathie
character of the Gibraltar skull, however unexpected, is at variance with its other-
wise primitive character.

The palate (fig. 24) is large, parallel sided (hypsiloid), and the alveolar walls are

continued backwards 10 millims. beyond the third molars. Its length is 63 millims.,
as measured to the fractured anterior margin, but cannot have been less originally
than 67 millims., and its breadth is 70 millims. ; it is, therefore, very dolicho-uranic,
with an index of 104°5. This is a smaller index than the mean for the Tasmanians
