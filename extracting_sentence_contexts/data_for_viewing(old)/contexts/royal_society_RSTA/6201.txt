long run.

For example, assume a Church-Turing hypothesis in which everything our mathematical
theories can infer or formalize by employing step-by-step effective methods is attainable by
finitely axiomatizable theories, or by Turing machines. As a consequence, our mathematical
theories will not be able to, in general, decide whether or not the infinite asymptotic behaviour
of a state space trajectory of a FDDDS continues to be uncomputable by those theories. At the
same time, the information carried or conveyed by any finite-length state space trajectory of a
FDDDS can always be added to prior formal theories in order to construct more overarching
new formal theories. Therefore, since AOIE implies ODE for infinitely many time steps in
the future, the Church-Turing hypothesis entails that a system displaying AOIE (and, in
this case, strong emergence) will always be understood as displaying ODE (and therefore
the aforementioned weak emergence), while in fact never ceasing to display ODE (or weak
emergence) for any possible mathematical theory we might devise. In other words, under the
Church-Turing hypothesis, if AOIE is considered strong emergence, then this type of strongly
emergent phenomenon is a pseudoparadoxical type of emergent phenomenon that is always
mathematically understood as weak emergence by us, while in fact displaying strong emergence
(if an hypothetical observer could know the point of view of every observer). Note that, not
only under the Church-Turing hypothesis, such a pseudoparadox of emergence also holds as
long as every observer and every observed state space trajectory of a system belong to the same
computational class.

Another form of strong emergence has been described as the ultimate necessity of novel
fundamental powers or laws to scientifically explain the macro-level behaviour of a system
