With the
added help of vision the frog may react against imminent danger of unbalance. The most important gravity receptors, however, lie in the labyrinths. Outstanding Features of the Labyrinthine Gravity Reactions

It would be tedious to attempt to describe in detail the different adjustments of
the frog, by forward, backward, sideward or diagonal body displacement to
simple gravity disturbanceâ€”especially as many of the facts have already been
recorded and illustrated by Tarr and McNay (1925). Instead, we shall deal with
the principles involved. As already affirmed, the reactions are identical whether elicited by slow inclination
on the tilt-table, by centrifugal force or by application of linear acceleration at
right angles to terrestrial gravity.
