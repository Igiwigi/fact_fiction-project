MR. HORNER ON THE ALLUVIAL LAND OF EGYPT. 89

HEKEKYAN BÞy, in his anxiety to fulfil my instructions that every variety of the allu-
vial 80il passed through in the pits should be noticed, carefully distinguished minute
differences in composition and colour, and sent specimens of all the varieties he de-
scribed. Although there are in fact only two classes, what may be termed loams and
sands, T have thought it advisable to preserve in the s8ections HEKEKYAN Bey's minute
distinctions. I have added to the above Table the local names which he has supplied.
as they may prove useful, should future geologists, directing their attention, as I trust
they will do, to the same subject, chance to see this memoir.

In the sections of the borings across the valley in the parallel of Heliopolis, given in

& Plates IV. and V., the letters used as signs of the different soils do not indicate the
Aame varieties as in the preceding Table; they are as follows :—

E Argillaceous earthy sediments, more or less mixed with 8and. Quartzose 8ands.
