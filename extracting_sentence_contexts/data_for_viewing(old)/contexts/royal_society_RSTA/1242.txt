the specimen preparation used to bring them into the microscope and that the interaction with
the electron beam is controlled such that there is minimal measurable alteration of structure and
chemistry of the specimen during analysis. In-situ analysis is the dynamic observation of the
reactions in or on a specimen contained within the microscope when stimulated by mechanical,
thermal, electrical, optical or chemical means. In-situ analysis, therefore, poses a number of
challenges: first the inherent beam sensitivity of both the starting components and the product
following in-situ phase transformation and/or reaction must be quantified and secondly, for
chemical reactions, the inherent beam sensitivity of the reactant liquids or gases, with which the
material is interacting in-situ, must be understood or accounted for.

Initially, we discuss the origins of electron beam sensitivity of materials and ways to mitigate
these effects. Electron beam-induced damage has been investigated intermittently over the years
including key studies in [3-7]. In fact electron irradiation has even been used as a surrogate for
fast neutron damage in the study of materials for application in nuclear fission and fusion (early
work is summarized in [8] and more recent works in [9-11]).

The electron dose experienced by a sample is the energy absorbed by the specimen during
electron irradiation and is a function of both the incident energy of the accelerated electrons,
electron fluence (the number of electrons per unit area) and fluence rate or flux (the number
of electrons per unit area per second) in the TEM, as well as parameters associated with the
specimen itself such as the thickness and chemical composition. The absorbed dose is strictly
measured in Grays (note a Gray (Gy) is 1 Joule of energy deposited per kg of matter), and


for 100 keV electrons exposed to a typical organic material an electron fluence of 1 electron/A*
