of incidence (as a compressional wave) at the surface or interface. We obtain, in fact, the
equivalent of the ‘T,,’-contribution, and may conclude, therefore, that these so-called
‘T',, disturbances should be felt however close to the source.

Ficure 24, Saddle-point contribution (4; =H+h—z, h,=H).

When h, = 0 the above arguments remain valid, for the steepest-descent curve still
contracts about @ = 1 and the fact that .4(—/) ( real) now increases linearly from # = 1
(not @ = /3, as before) simply cuts out the second possibility of two intersections in
1<6<,/3; the T,,-pulses must therefore always precede the I;,. This case was treated in
part by Lapwood in the problem of the uniform medium, but there were naturally no
A,,- and A,,-branch lines to consider.

When h, = 0 the arguments must be slightly altered as the steepest-descent curve now
contracts about = ,/3 (i.e. xp,); the T,,-, T',,-, I'g,-pulses become significant in that order
and the I’,,-pulse at an earlier, later, or intermediate stage depending on the velocity
ratios only. In this case the I',,-pulses arise from the saddle-point contribution and should
therefore be felt at all distances.

Our results have been obtained for a harmonic vibration of period 27/w, where, to
