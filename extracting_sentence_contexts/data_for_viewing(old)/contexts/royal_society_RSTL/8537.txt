Mr. Bixxey and Mr. CarrvutHers both reply, it is the fruit of a Calamite. But my

doubts expressed long ago on this point remain not only unremoved, but strengthened
by further researches. My cabinet contains nearly fifty sections of these fruits, and L
Â© have examined others in the cabinets of my friends. That the sporangia of these
strobili adhere to the sporangiophores in a manner closely resembling those of the
modern Fquisetacec, as pointed out by Mr. CARRUTHERS, is undoubtedly true; and,
assuming the Calamites to be Zquisetacew, the above fact might be deemed a strong
confirmation of the conclusion arrived at by the above observers. Mr. CarRruTHERs, in
addition, thinks that he sees elaters attached to the spores, which conclusion, if true,
would be an important additional fact pointing in the same direction. But, for reasons
to be given immediately, I am unable to accept this interpretation of the structures in
question. Notwithstanding what has been done by the two eminent obseryers referred
to, sufficient remains to be discovered in this fruit to justify my re-examination of it.
Its general plan of construction is, as Mr. CARRUTHERS has shown, very different from
that of Asferophyllites Dawsoni. It has a jointed axis with enlarged nodes, each of
which gives off appendages which are alternately bractigerous disks, somewhat
resembling those of Asterophyllites Dawsont deprived of their sporangia, and yerticils
of sporangiophores, which are almost identical in their organization, as well as in their
mode of sustaining their sporangia, with those of the living Equisetums. Mr.
