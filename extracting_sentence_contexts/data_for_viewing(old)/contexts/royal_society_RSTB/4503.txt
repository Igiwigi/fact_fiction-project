expression of this resultant would be an albino strain such as that described. Such
a concomitance of conditions might well appear almost inconceivable, but the appear-
ance of an albinistic strain of the fungus is equally almost inconceivable, for in the
history of the genus as we know it it has occurred but once.

It would seem to me probable that the same concept which Barrson (8) and
Lorsy (48) have formulated for the higher organisms may hold true for both fungi
and bacteria, but here the recombination of genes may not only take place by sexual
fusions, but also by direct “contamination” of one species by the nuclei and cytoplasm
of another in vegetative anastomoses. New reacting systems of chromosomal loci
impinge upon each other, and the resultant is the new form. This at first may be
heterocaryotic, but if true sexual processes occur later, the offspring become homo-
caryotic but heterozygous. Such a hypothesis fits the facts and explains them as I
think no other present hypothesis does.

It is not the possibility of mutation in the fungi (and bacteria) that is here denied,
but rather the compulsion to accept that interpretation of the evidence as it now
stands. As the facts present themselves to me, avenues of interpretation other than
that of mutation are still widely open.
