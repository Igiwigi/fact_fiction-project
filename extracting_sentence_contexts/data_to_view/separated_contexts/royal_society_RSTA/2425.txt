ELM control coils on the other hand seem to work over a large parameter space; they also have
some disadvantages such as reducing particle confinement and thus density, however, with deep
pellet fuelling, this could most likely be overcome. While not all the physics of ELM control coils is
understood, they should be installed in a reactor on the VV wall. The installation of such copper-
based water-cooled ELM control coils is possible because the neutron radiation level behind the
blanket cannot be larger than in ITER due to the fact that the VV is also the first safety barrier in


a fusion reactor. Therefore, He production in the VV steel must be limited to similar values as in
ITER in order to allow rewelding. The divertor of a fusion reactor should be similar in type to that in ITER following similar
design rules as explained below.
