The semigroup e!Ae satisfies the maximum principle, namely le!424||o0 < |IPlloo- Hence, recalling
the definition of Q and €g,

Moreover, applying Stratonovich calculus to the stochastic equation (1.3) and using the fact that
u's are divergence free, we obtain the inequality

If To = 0, then both T(t) and T¢(t) are non-negative. Choose a sequence ¢, converging to 1 in D.
We deduce
