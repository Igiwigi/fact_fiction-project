according to the interval since their previous capture. It is assumed that the death-rate
is constant and independent of age. Accordingly, the August sample must be excluded
and the data must be considered in two periods within which the rate of survival was at
least roughly constant. The data required for these calculations are given in table 18,
superscripts denoting accidental deaths for which corrections have been made.

From these analyses the constant survival rates (P) and standard errors per period are
estimated as follows:

Sept. to Jan. P=0-874+-0-040 (mean interval 4-81 weeks)
Jan. to May P=0-544+0-044 (mean interval 5-62 weeks)

A slight error is introduced by the fact that the intervals between trappings were unequal.
However, the order of magnitude of the change in death-rate is undoubtedly shown by

comparing weekly death-rates based on the mean intervals within the two periods. From
the formula in table 17 the increase in death-rate is found to be from about 0-028 to
0-108 per week.

of the ‘Lincoln index’ (Lincoln 1930); but unfortunately it was only from February on-
wards that the whole population seemed finally to be at risk to the traps (p. 527). Direct
