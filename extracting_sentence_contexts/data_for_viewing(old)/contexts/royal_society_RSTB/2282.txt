stimulation reveals. The degeneration method by its results explains the cause of
the discrepancy between the observations by the two methods. The degeneration
experiments show that in some muscles the number of motor nerve-fibres given by a
spinal-root to a muscle is too small to evoke from the muscle any contraction at all
obvious to inspection. Cases occur where a limb muscle receives one, two, three,
four, or five motor-fibres from a particular root ; allow to each of these motor nerve-
fibres a dozen muscle-fibres, it is easy to understand that sixty muscle-fibres scattered
in a muscle consisting of many thousands may cause no perceptible tightening of
the tendon; they may simply stretch or compress adjoining inactive and elastic
fibres. The degeneration of these few fibres I regard as strong evidence of the
morphological character of the overlap; the fewness of the fibres is one of the
many facts which indicate that the distribution of the motor-roots is arranged on a
segmental plan in accordance with the terms of a bequest dating back to a time
when the present environment of the limb, especially in its Mammalian form, had
no preponderant weight in the shaping thereof. As regards functional value this
character of the Mammalian limb is on a par with details of structure which are

not specific, and, therefore, with other details of structure outside those immediately
© acquired by the species, not to be considered as of necessity of present functional
importance. The functional use of the contribution of one or two nerve-fibres to a
muscle requiring hundreds is difficult to see; the probability of the occurrence
of such poverty-stricken contributions is, on the view of the morphological necessity
of the ray-arrangement of the limb musculature, so high as to be only what might
have been expected from theoretical considerations. The fact that certain’of the
