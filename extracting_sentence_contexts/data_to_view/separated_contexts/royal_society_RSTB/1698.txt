The base of
> the stem, where the adventitious roots were given off, must have been buried for
» some depth in the earth or mud. Probably the bases of stems would be the parts
most often preserved, which would explain the frequency with which adventitious
4 roots are met with in connection with the stem. It is not probable that the roots
2 Were atrial; the fact that they branched freely immediately on leaving the stem
» militates against such an idea (see photograph 10, fig. 18). The velamen-like
3 outer layer, which might suggest an aérial root, is common to the finest rootlets,
2 and these must almost certainly have been subterranean, The well-developed xylem
> of the roots renders it probable that they vegetated in a fairly firm soil. The stem is mechanically well-constructed and thus fitted to maintaiu an upright
2 position while bearing abundant foliage.
