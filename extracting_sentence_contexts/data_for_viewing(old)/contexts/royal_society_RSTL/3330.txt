As the glass would not admit of distinct vision for objects at a less distance
than one hundred feet, and it being necessary to use the instrument, at times,

not more than three feet distance from the station-staff, several lenses were
made of different focal distances, as sixty, thirty, fifteen, eight feet, and thirty
inches ; which, being applied to the object end of the telescope, converts it; in
fact, to a microscope.

To the lower part of the telescope, within the collars, are affixed the cocks,
into which fits the tube protecting the level : one of these cocks gives a ver-
tical, and the other a horizontal motion to the tube, in order to place the leyel
parallel to the axis of the telescope.

When the instrument was first made, these motions were effected by means
of endless screws; but I found it s0 difficult (almost impossible) to keep a
delicate level in adjustment by this mode, that I substituted the old fashion of
capstan-headed pushing screws.

To the upper part of the telescope are attached (outside either points of sup-
