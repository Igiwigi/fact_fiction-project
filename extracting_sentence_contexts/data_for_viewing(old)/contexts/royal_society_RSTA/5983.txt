with [15]. We deduce that if 7 is sufficiently small, the regularized DBOC can reproduce the effect
of the exact DBOC. We then test the compensation of GP and DBOC: it was previously found that
when GP is not included in the simulation, not including DBOC improves the results [15]. This is
indeed what we observe in figure 1 for the ‘no DBOC’ case, where the initial population dynamics
is captured when both GP and DBOC are overlooked.

We now test the impact of GP in enhancing the transfer probability for the components of
the wavepackets with zero angular momentum with respect to the CI [15]. This effect is better
illustrated in the case of the butatriene cation, where the wavepacket has a large component
(87%) with zero angular momentum when arriving at the CI [15]. Figure 2a shows that DBOC
only has a minor impact on the population evolution. Indeed, including DBOC or not does
not significantly affect the population dynamics. This absence of effect also appears through
the fact that the value of the regularization parameter does not significantly change the results.
