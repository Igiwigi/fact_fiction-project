346 MR. EVANS ON THE DEVIATION OF THE COMPASS

early days considered experimental, and built of the best material, had very small qua-
drantal deviations, viz. 1* and 1? 6' respectively; indeed the Astronomer Royal expe-
rienced difficulty in tracing the effects of terrestrial induction. Bearing these facts
in view, and taking further into consideration that in building Government vessels
stringent conditions of contract as to soundness of material are enforced, and strict
supervision exercised, it may be fairly assumed that the amount given of 2® to 4® repre-
sents the average condition of a well-built ship of the best or superior iron. On the other hand, can the inference be drawn that an iron ship with large qua-
drantal deviation implies inferior material being used in her constraction ? Two of the most disastrous and fatal shipwrecks on record have occurred to iron-
built vessels, whose magnetic characters are perfectly known.
