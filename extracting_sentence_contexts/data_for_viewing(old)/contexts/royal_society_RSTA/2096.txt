mechanics. We are making this choice because the Hamiltonian formulation has proven to be
particularly useful in attempts to combine mechanics with other theories (e.g. with geometric
optics or with thermodynamics), in attempts to extend mechanics (e.g. to quantum mechanics),
and in attempts to recognize the geometry involved in mechanics (e.g the symplectic or the
contact geometries). The continuum version of mechanics (represented in the Euler equation)
has been put into the Hamiltonian form by Clebsch [27] and later, by Arnold [28], where the
connection of non-canonical Hamiltonian structures with the Lie group theory was recognized.
As in the particle mechanics, the usefulness of the Hamiltonian formulation of the continuum
mechanics has come to light in particular in extensions, in unifications with other mesoscopic
theories, in relation to thermodynamics, in numerical solutions, and in geometrical formulations
(see [2] and references cited therein).

Advantages of the Hamiltonian formulation stem mainly from the fact that the vector field
generating the time evolution involves two objects that have two different and independent
physical contents. One is the geometrical structure expressing mathematically kinematics of
the chosen state variables and the other is a potential (a real-valued function) representing the
energy (i.e. the quantity involving all the internal mechanical forces). In reductions, we consider
the kinematics and the energy separately. This is the main contribution (and advantage) of the
dynamic reductions discussed below.
