F DR. ALLMAN ON THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF CORDYLOPHORA. 373

'ORGANS FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE SPECIESâ€”EMBRYOLOGY. The researches of modern naturalists, especially of EnrexBtrG, Loven, Van
BeneDeN, Sars, and Dvu3arbin, have thrown much light on the embryology of the
inferior zoophytes, and their observations have brought to our knowledge many
remarkable and unexpected facts, though physiologists are by no means of one mind
as to the trae signification of several of the facts with which we have thus become
acquainted. During the later snummer and autumn months Cordylophora lacustris may be seen
with numerous oval capsules borne upon the ultimate or polypiferous ramuli, fig. 2. Each ramulus generally carries one, two, or three of these capsules, which are

8X situated alternately on either side of the ramulus at some distance behind the body
a of the polype, and where the branch is stjll covered by the polypary, the more
5 advanced capsules being always nearer to the main stems.
