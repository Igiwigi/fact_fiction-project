thus all contact between the leads and tank-water was prevented. The calori-
meter was hung below the steel lid by five glass tubes, thus ten air-tight junctions
of glass to metal were required, in fact, four of these junctions were, in reality,
double ones, for the lower extremities of the narrow tubes e and f (Plate 5, fig. 1)
had not only to be fixed into the lid of the calorimeter, but also joined on to the
ends of the silver tubing. In like manner, where they passed through the steel
lid, they had to join also on to glass tubes leading to two glass taps immersed in
the outer tank. There were, therefore, practically fourteen such joints.
