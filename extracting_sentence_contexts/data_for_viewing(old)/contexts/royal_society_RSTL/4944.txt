the bodies of the spermatozoa ; as we have seen that segmentation of the yelk takes
place most quickly in proportion to the number of spermatozoa, within certain limits,
in contact with the ovum. And such also is the case in a state of nature.

'These facts appear to give that direct negative and refutation to the hypothesis of
the immediate agency of the liquor seminis in impregnation which Wacxtr and
LevckxarpTy remark it has not hitherto met with ; and they lead to the supposition
that one of the chief uses of the fluid is merely that of a vehicle through which the
spermatozoa are more readily brought into contact with the ova. Possibly it may
bear that relation to the spermatozoa in the viviparous vertebrata, in which it chiefly
occurs, which the fluid medium into which the ova of Amphibia and Fishes are ex-
pelled, bears to the spermatozoa in those classes. This view may derive some sup-
port from the fact that the liquor seminis has recently been shown by chemical
analysis to consist chiefly of a thin s0lution of mucus, with small quantities of chlo-
ride of sodium and phosphates and sulphates of the alkaliesF.
