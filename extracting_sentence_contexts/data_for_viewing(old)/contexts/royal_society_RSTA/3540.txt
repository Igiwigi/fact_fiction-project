HPHT sour wells that contain $Â°, higher Mo-alloyed Ni alloys such as 625+ (UNS N7716) and 725
(UNS N7725) are the materials of choice. In subsea applications, alloy 725 is considered to be one
of the most reliable high-strength corrosion-resistant alloys and is preferred over alloy 718 due to
the fact that the latter is susceptible to localized corrosion in seawater. In some unavoidable design
configurations, components made of alloy 725 are in contact with other materials that require CP.

The remarkable SCC resistance of PH Ni alloys in H2S-containing environments at high
temperatures has been demonstrated through comprehensive testing [2,4,5]. Laboratory test
results are additionally supported by the extensive use and outstanding field performance record
of these alloys in real applications. However, failures attributed to hydrogen embrittlement (HE)
of oilfield upstream components manufactured using some PH Ni alloys have been reported
in the literature [6-9]. Even though these failures could be classified as hydrogen-environment
embrittlement failures the general term HE has been employed, and is also used in this paper
for referencing the mechanism that involves subcritical cracking at the surface of materials
under sustained loads in hydrogen (H)-bearing environments [10,11]. Despite the fact that HE
susceptibility in PH Ni alloys is a well-known engineering problem [12-15], these failures have
