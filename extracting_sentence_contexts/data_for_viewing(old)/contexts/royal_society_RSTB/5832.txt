the volume) of the resting follicle. In the mouse the corresponding figure is about 1°5
(BRAMBELL and Parkes, 1927) and in the baboon (ZucKERMAN and ParRKEs, 1932)
about 6-0. Thus the ratio between the sizes of the mature and the resting follicle
appears to increase with the body weight of the animal, i.¢., with increasing body
weight of the species, the size of the resting follicle does not keep pace with the greatly
increased size of the mature follicle.

(f) Growth and Regression of the Corpus Luteum.—Corpora lutea were found in
the ovaries of only 18 squirrels ; all these were killed during pregnancy, or after parturi-
tion, in the months of March, June, July, August and September. No post-partum
ovulation had occurred in any of the 22 lactating squirrels examined, and in only 7 of
these were the remains of the corpora lutea of pregnancy still to be seen. Almost all the
corpora lutea were measured in section (Appendix 6), but owing to the fact that many
were irregular in shape the mean diameters obtained by the method described can only
give approximate indications of the size of the body. Taken in conjunction with direct
comparison of lutein cell size, however, these measurements showed that the corpus
luteum reaches its maximum size rapidly, and then has a mean diameter 1-0-1-3 mm.
The corpus luteum begins to regress about half-way through pregnancy; in No. 93,
where an embryo weighed 1-07 gm., signs of shrinkage and degeneration were already
apparent and in No. 107 having embryos weighing 1-87 gm. the mean diameter of the
corpus luteum was only 0-74 mm., obvious shrinkage having taken place.

The most recently formed corpora lutea in the present series of ovaries are those of
No. 73, fig. 7, Plate 9; they are solid but project irregularly from the surface of the
ovary and portions of the theca interna can still be distinguished. The spindle-shaped
