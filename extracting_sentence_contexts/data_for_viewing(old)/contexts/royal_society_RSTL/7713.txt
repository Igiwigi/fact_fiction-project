course, and may frequently be seen to communicate with the transverse bundles which
traverse the grey tubercle (e, fig. 10, Plate VIIL.), and the sensory roots of the fifth
nerye contained therein. By means of a special 8et of commissural fibres (U', fig. 39,
Plate XI.), the entire group has a very intimate connexion with other surrounding.
parts, but particularly with the cells on the right of t, belonging to the glossopharyngeal
macleus, and with the s0-called * fasciculus teres.” On proceeding from the group
backward, some of these fibres (at U') turn round at different depths to end in the
transverse arciform bundles; some turn round to be continuous with the longitudinal
bundles; others pass further backward to the glossopharyngeal nucleus and * fasciculus
teres;” while a few are seen to be continuous with returning fibres of the glossopha-
ryngeal nerve which do not enter their nucleus.

(27) In18575 I pointed out the fact that the descending portion of the posterior root
of the fifth nerve, instead of traversing the restiform body, as it was previously believed
to do, runs down through the front of the grey tubercle, or caput cornu posterioris.
The transversely cut ends of its longitudinal fibres are represented by the dark spots in
the grey tubercle at e, fig. 10, Plate VIIL. Moreover, I formerly showed# that both
the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerve, on their way to their nuclei, trayerse the grey
tubercle and pass through this portion of the fifth nerve; while I have since had reason
to think that some of their roots terminate in the grey tubercle as one of their centres
of origin.
