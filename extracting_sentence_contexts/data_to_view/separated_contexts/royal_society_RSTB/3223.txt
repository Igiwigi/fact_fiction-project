Experiments on the suction and exudation of trees at different levels, and upon
the influence of the entry of air and water under pressure, showed that no continuous
suspended water columns or high internal tensions existed in the conducting
elements of the trees experimented on (Maple and Poplar) during active transpiration,
or, indeed, at any period of the year. The same was shown by direct measurements
of the pressure in intact vessels of Wistaria during active transpiration. This fact,
coupled with the high total resistance to flow, shows that this resistance is
overcome locally from point to point, and not by any enormous tension from above
or pressure from below, neither of which exists nor could be maintained to a suflicient
extent to carry on the elevation of water ina tall tree. A high tension from above
leads to rapid blocking with air; a high pressure from below leads to great loss by
lateral exudation from the vessels. The apparent differences of osmotic pressure previously observed between leaves
at the base and apex of a tall tree are not evidence of the existence of any greater
osmotic suction at the higher level, but are the result of the different ages and
sizes of the cells, and of the different conditions to which they have been exposed.
