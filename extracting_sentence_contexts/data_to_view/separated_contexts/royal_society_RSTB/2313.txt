But I have repeatedly had occasion to
recognise this principal point, that the energy of the excited effect may be in excess
of the energy of the exciting cause. Excessive stimulation, so far from giving a larger, gives a smaller blaze effect than
does moderate stimulation. And I have repeatedly been struck by the fact that a
single over-strong stimulus not only diminishes the blaze effect provoked by a subse-
quent moderate stimulus, but that the effect of the excessive stimulus is itself far
short of the effect caused by a moderate stimulus. One might have expected that
the final explosion provoked by the excessive stimulus should itself be excessive, but
one finds that such excessive stimulus, by injury of tissue, sets a limit to the effect
which itself produces. The development of a blaze effect is sudden ; its decline is gradual.
