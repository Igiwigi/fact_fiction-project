Supposing then

the two neutral atoms to collide, a corpuscle

is transferred from the sodium to the chlorine

atom, the former thus becoming a positively charged

and the latter a negatively charged radical. The two oppositely & equally electrically charged radicals then
attract each other & unite to form a neutral molecule

of common salt. [24, p 16]

Perhaps more interestingly, there is also a visionary speculation on whether the elements might
have been formed in a process analogous to Darwinian evolution. The scene is first set:

The time has in fact come when

the chemist is compelled to apply the doctrine

of evolution to the elements themselves, & to

regard them, like chemical compounds, as the fittest survivals from a
struggle for existence, a struggle however between things of a
simpler and entirely different order to any we have

hitherto known. [24, p 3]

At the present day the position of the chemist
with respect to the problem of the constitution of
the elements & their synthesis is like that of the


organic chemist prior to Wohlers synthesis

of urea. He was acquainted with

the products of the decomposition of organic
compounds. He could

resolve organic compounds into their elements
by laboratory methods & he could observe
their decomposition in nature; their synthesis
in nature was also open to his gaze, but as

yet he had not produced an organic compound
out of its elements.
