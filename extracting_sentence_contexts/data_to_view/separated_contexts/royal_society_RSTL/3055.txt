My theory, as far as I have yentured it, does not pretend to decide upon the
consequences of a vacuum. It is not at present limited sufficiently, or rendered pre-
cise enough, either by experiments relating to spaces yoid of matter, or those of other
kinds, to indicate what would happen in the vacuum case. I have only as yet en-
deavoured to establish, what all the facts seem to prove, that when electrical phe-
nomena, as those of induction, conduction, insulation and discharge occur, they de-
pend on, and are produced by the action of contiguous particles of matter, the next
existing particle being considered as the contiguous one; and [I have further assumed,
that these particles are polarized ; that each exhibits the two forces, or the force in
two directions (1295. 1298.) ; and that they act at a distance only by acting on the
contiguous and intermediate particles.

1616. But assuming that a perfect vacuum were to intervene in the course of the
lines of inductive action (1304.), it does not follow from this theory, that the particles
on opposite sides of such a vacuum could not act on each other. Suppose it possible
for a positively electrified particle to be in the centre of a yacuum an inch in diameter,
nothing in my present views forbids that the particle should act at the distance of half
an inch on all the particles forming the inner superficies of the bounding sphere, and
with a force consistent with the well-known law of the squares of the distance.
