tain over 3400 genes each, half of which were shown to be
expressed in the gametophytes [77]. In addition to haploid
gene expression, the lack of degeneration could be due to
the small size of the SDR seen in many plants, as degener-
ation is predicted to be faster when many genes are under
selection [86,87].

Plant sex chromosomes are not without consequences
from suppressed recombination. A consistent pattern found
is an enrichment of transposable elements (TEs) and other
repeats [77,88-90], which often accumulate in regions of
low recombination [91]. In fact, in several species TE expan-
sions have instead driven the Y chromosome to be larger
than the X, such as in Coccinia grandis [92] and S. latifolia
[93]. This pattern is counter to the smaller-Y heteromorphy
found in the insects studied in Stevens’ day. While many Y
chromosomes in animals are also riddled with repeats, in
well-studied species most of the genes have been lost [94—
97]. Moving beyond analyses of single species, comparisons
between sister species with a shared evolution of sex chromo-
somes, such as in Coccinia [98], will provide greater insight
into these degenerative processes.
