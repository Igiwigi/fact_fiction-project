HOBSON ON A TYPE OF SPHERICAL HARMONICS

Remarks on Hutne’s definition of P,, (p).

37. Herne has proposed* to define the function P,, («) for complex values of n and p,
by means of the expression

Pau) = 2 (ut Va 1 008)

It will appear from what we have shown in Arts, 33-36, that this definition is not a
valid one, as the function given by the definite integral for values of » with a negative
real part is not the analytical continuation of the function given by the same definite
integral for values of yw with a positive real part ; it follows that P, (u) can be defined
by the above expression only for values of » with a positive real part. The fact that the definite integral is of ambiguous meaning at the imaginary p axis
is clear if we attend to the phases of the integrand (1 + ./,? — 1 cos )", or h"; » being
purely imaginary there is a value of between 0 and a for which h vanishes, and in
passing through this value of w the phase of the integrand changes by a finite amount. The / integral in Art. 33 is taken along a path joining z, = which has the point h = 0
on the left hand side, thus for purely imaginary values of » the path may be placed

ly

as in the figure, with a semi-cireular portion to avoid the point h = 0; we thus see
that in the above definite integral there must be a sudden diminution of phase mz in
the integrand as cos yf passes through the value we ; if this be taken into account

the definite integral will represent the function P, (4) for purely imaginary values
of 1; there is however nothing in the definite integral itself which decides apart from
convention what the change of phase in the integrand shall be as it passes through its
zero value. Next suppose p to cross the imaginary axis, the / integral can then be taken from
