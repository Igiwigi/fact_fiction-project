The
tubules themselves differ from those of the other group of animals in that the zone of
Sertoli nuclei is situated close to the wall of the tubule, without a wide intermediate
zone of cytoplasm. Spermatogonia are much more numerous and there is no trace
of a lumen in the tubules. These testes closely resemble those of young animals in
summer prior to the onset of puberty and it would appear reasonable to assume that
they are in fact prepubertal. The testes of the first type, on the other hand,
obviously belong to animals which have bred previously and which are therefore
in true non-breeding condition. The characteristics of these testes are such as would
be expected when the enormous size difference between those of breeding and
non-breeding animals is considered.
