acentury later by Thiele [1]. It is nowadays referred to as Hilbert’s 24th problem due to the fact that it could have made
it into the famous collection of problems, 10 of which were presented on 8 August at the 1900
International Congress of Mathematicians, a total of 23 of which were published in [2] and made
widely known after the Congress through various translations. The influence of the 24th problem was, as we will show in the sequel, considerable during
