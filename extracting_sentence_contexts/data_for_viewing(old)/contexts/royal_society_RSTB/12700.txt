phenotypes of their offspring (descendants). Its power lies in the fact that
it requires no simplifying assumptions other than a closed population, but
realizing the full potential of Price’s result requires that we flesh out the
mathematical representation of both fitness and offspring phenotype.

themselves functions of parental phenotype. Here, I show how new math-
