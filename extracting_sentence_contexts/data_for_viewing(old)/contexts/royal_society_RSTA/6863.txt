It is difficult to give any precise information about the degree of accuracy of the coefficients
in this Fourier expansion but it may be observed that when equations (6-1-9) were solved
for the coefficients B,, D,,...,B;,D;, all the remaining coefficients being zero, the value
found for 6@ agreed with the first six terms in the bracket in (6-3-1) or at most differed by
one in the fourth decimal place. To be sure of three significant figures for the values of
00 it would be necessary to have more terms in the Fourier expansion but the considerable
extra numerical work which would be required does not appear to be worth while, and it is
only when all the terms in the bracket in (6-3-1) have the same sign that the third figure is
likely to be much in error.

The value of 22 at the hole may most conveniently be found by evaluating 77+ 00 +-22
and then by using (6-3-1) and the fact that 77 is zero at the hole. This gives
- = {—0-1689 — 0-1211 cos 7€ + 0-0293 cos 21€ — 00105 cos 3m

Some check on the accuracy of the work is provided by the fact that at the surfaces of the
plate ¢ = +1 the stress 22 should vanish. The formula (6-3-2) for 22 gives only a very small
residual stress 0-0005 T cos 20 when ¢ = +1.
