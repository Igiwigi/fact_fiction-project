Exact wave functions for complex atoms cannot be derived, and the necessity of employing
approximations such as those of Slater (1932), Hartree (1946~7) or Fock (1930) introduces
uncertainties distinct from those inherent in the Born treatment. If y, and y, (in (26)) overlap considerably and are not too crudely represented, the
additional error will in general be relatively unimportant. In some cases it may be worth
taking advantage of the fact that by making use of the equations satisfied by the y’s the
original formula may be transformed to

Iyg( Ky hy) AK = Fy | [exp (—iKe2) {yy () “PEED — yg (xy HO)

3 } | xe Ey (0)t

} This transformation is closely analogous to that introduced by Chandrasekhar (1945) in his work on
the calculation of the cross-section associated with photo-detachment from H™. EXCITATION AND IONIZATION OF ATOMS 99

While (26) and (30) are formally equivalent they are not necessarily the same in practical
computations, since they weight the various regions of co-ordinate space differently. In
consequence, by evaluating the cross-sections, using each separately, some information may
be obtained on the inaccuracies caused by defects in the ys.
