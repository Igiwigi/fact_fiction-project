However, in extremis, people simply
could not afford food. Use of emergency foodbanks increased nearly 50% in 2010 [77]. The fact
that global markets determine local prices highlights the importance of managing the balance of
risks between local people and people far away. A key cause of food price spikes comes from
governments reducing local risks (by instituting export bans to hedge against supply shortfalls),
at the expense of accelerating the global perceptions of likely shortfall, and global impacts. Clearly, the issue of food security and response to climate affects all countries and parts of the
global food system, while the risks are manifest in different ways in food exporting countries,
countries with large poor populations, and countries that are concerned with food in terms of
price and affordability.
