Besides the lines of Group I, Exner and HascueK have included the red pair of
Group IT (4% 6371, 6347) as appearing faintly in the are spectrum. As in the case of
magnesium, and many other elements, however, these spark lines are restricted to a
region very close to the poles of the arc. This method of producing the red pair was,
in fact, employed by the author in 1906, in the identification of the red pair of lines in
the solar and chromospheric spectra.§
