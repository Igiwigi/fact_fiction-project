external forces*. The arteries which pass between the articular cartilage and the
synovial membrane, like those of the foetus, may be considered as the termination of
the articular arteries. At the point where the reflexed becomes continuous with the
articular synovial membrane, it contains large vessels subjacent to it, which are
numerous and plexiform. Immediately, however, that they enter the cellular web,
between the articular cartilage and synovial membrane, they become enlarged and
straight, and pass to a greater or less distance over the border of the articular car-
tilage, forming loops frequently with considerable dilatations, and becoming finally
continuous with the veins. The free surface of adult articular cartilage appears to
be nourished by the liquor sanguinis, which exudes from these looped and dilated
vessels.

'The following are the leading facts which the preceding researches upon Articular
Cartilage tend to establish :â€”

1. Epiphysal and articular cartilage are developed and nourished in the early
periods of foetal existence, without the presence of blood-vessels in the substance of
the former, or on the surface of the latter.

2. At snbsequent periods, canals are formed in the epiphysal cartilage, vessels are
prolonged into them, which converge towards the articular cartilage ; and also
vessels extend over a considerable portion of the free surface of articular cartilage.

3. At later periods, the epiphysal cartilage ossifies, and for a considerable time
vessels are placed between the ossified nucleus and the articular cartilage.
