Now, since the vapour pressure
difference between solvent and solution is being read directly, only the slope of the
reference graphs enter into the calculation. The slope is much more accurately defined
by the points than the actual position of the curves. The fact that there are now only
two readings to take instead of four will also reduce errors. This method will now be
described in detail. Apparatus.â€”Figs.
