The Fokker—Planck-like dissipation can be

with respect to f*, where T = de/ds stands for the local temperature field. The irreversible Fokker—
Planck-like terms can be motivated in two ways: (i) Considering a continuum particle is subject to
random (Brownian) motion, the Fokker-Planck term appears in the equation for the distribution


function as a result of the fluctuations [37]; and (ii) it is anticipated that fast oscillations in the
v—space develop due to phenomena related to the Landau damping [34,40-42]. Focusing on the leading order solution of the distribution function, we take advantage of the
fact that its evolution is described by a first order quasi-linear partial differential equation whose
characteristics (R;(t), V;(t)), parametrized by time t, are given by

The leading order solution to this problem is also known as the inner solution (focusing on the fast
initial transition period) in the singular perturbation method [43], while rescaling of time t = te

yielding the large-time (outer) solution. Note that the initial fast transition period yields a fast
equilibration of V;(t) while characteristics remain almost parallel with v; as R;(t) are essentially
constant; for larger times (the outer solution) V; are enslaved to the remaining state variables
(invoking singular perturbation limit with € tending to zero and an analogue of Tikhonov’s
theorem). Hence here we can see a particular realization of the convergence of the upper vector fields to
the lower level vector fields corresponding to large time asymptotics of the characteristics, with a
fixed point being a solution to
