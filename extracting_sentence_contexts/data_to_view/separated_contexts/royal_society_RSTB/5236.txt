Of the ten
ambulacral plates (fig. 3, a and b) those of the Ia, Ia, 111b, 1Va, Vb series are somewhat
larger than the remaining five although the difference is not so pronounced as in Echinus
miliaris (GORDON, 1926, a, p. 266, fig. 3). The lantern of Aristotle has been omitted
from the diagram, and the primordia of the ten large buccal plates have not yet
appeared. Apart from the fact that ambulacral plate Ia is larger than IIb and that
genital 1 is larger than genital 2, the symmetry about the axis AB is complete. The
test is very asymmetrical about Lovin’s axis CD.
