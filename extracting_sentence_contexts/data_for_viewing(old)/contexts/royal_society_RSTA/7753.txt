represented in a particular group of lines upon which the attention may be fixed.

In neon (fig. 2) the /, g, . . . . terms lie very close to the d levels, and the p terms of
next lower principal quantum number are far below. Hence the 6d’s and 7a’s, are all
shifted downward by the field in the manner generally considered characteristic
of diffuse series. In argon the 6f’s approach nearer the 7d’s, so that while the higher
7d terms are strongly displaced downward the 7d, and 7d, at the lower edge of the
group (nearest the 6p’s) have very small displacements. The progressive change is
carried a step further in krypton even at lower quantum numbers. Here the
6d, and 64d, levels are actually displaced upward by the 5p terms (not shown).
Finally, in xenon the 6d and 5p groups are overlapping. The 6d, starts upward, but
on approaching the 5, level—now above it—is repelled downward. This series of
observations offers a further illustration of the fact that the Stark effect is not deter-
mined by the type of level alone.

The reversal of a term may be shown in a relatively simple theoretical case. In
fig. 6 the terms 5 (P, D, F, G) with m = 1 have been given separations 30, 10, and
1 cm. '' respectively. Using hydrogenic matrix terms, the resulting quartic secular
equation has been solved to give the displacements which are graphically represented.
It may be noticed that in low fields the F level is repelled by the G and forced toward
the D level. Upon close approach to the latter it reverses its direction and at
100 kV/cm. has crossed its zero field position.

In a close structure many reversals may occur at about the same point. For
example, in argon at % 4750 (see Plate 5), Rype (1937) has reported reversals
