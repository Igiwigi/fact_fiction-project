the air surrounding the electrode. To show this the gauze cap was removed from
the apparatus in fig. 2, and the metal tube surrounding the wire was brought forward
and sealed to the anode of the discharge tube. The arrangement is shown in fig. 3.

With this apparatus it was found that, as the exhaustion proceeded in the chamber
B, the negative charge received by the electrode A gradually increased, until finally,
at a very high vacuum, a momentary discharge of the rays was sufficient to raise its
potential beyond the range of the electrometer. This result, therefore, confirms the
explanation already given of the discharging action of the rays. In a recent paper
by Lenarpf this charging action of the cathode rays in a high vacuum was described,
but its connection with the ionized air surrounding the electrode was not brought
out. From the experiments just described it is clear that, while this action is directly
due to the fact that the cathode rays carry a negative charge, the extent of the effect
obtained in all cases depends to a very great degree upon the opposing influence
exerted by the ionized air surrounding the electrode upon which the rays fall.

4, Ionization not due to Rintgen Rays.

It has been thought by some that the ionization produced by eathode rays was due
to Réntgen rays, which might possibly be sent out from tne window at the same
time. The results of experiment are, however, entirely opposed to this view.
