with those fungi which produce moderate amounts of volatile neutral compounds
(alcohol). All the species grow reasonably well on CzaprK-Dox solution. None of the
species gives rise to appreciable amounts of either carbon as non-volatile acids or as
titratable acidity, and in fact, four of the species actually produce a decrease in the initial
acidity of the medium. Five out of six species give negligible, or even negative amounts
of “carbon unaccounted for,” but the other species, Helminthosporium geniculatum,
provides the first instance so far recorded, in this paper, of any of the miscellaneous
fungi worthy of further intensive investigation. This species has a figure for ‘“ carbon
unaccounted for ” of 0-622 gm., corresponding to a yield of 13 per cent. of the glucose
fermented. This, together with 0-818 gm. of “carbon as volatile neutral compounds,”
corresponding to a yield of 17 per cent., gives a total yield of metabolic products other
than carbon dioxide of 30 per cent. An investigation has been carried out on the
nature of the compounds included in the “carbon unaccounted for” produced by
this species, and is reported in Part XVIT.
