These new boundary conditions radiated a wave that is going backward to the source: the
so-called time-reversed field gy,(r, f). It can be computed using the Helmholtz—Kirchhoff integral
that is valid inside a zone without source. Note that the refocusing time is expected at 2T, which
is redefined in the following text as the new time origin.

We have to note that that this new wavefield verifies a homogeneous wave equation with the
time-reversed BCs (the original source is no longer present):

1 a gtr(r, t)
wae 0. (2.2)
Therefore, it cannot be equal to g(r, —f). In fact, it is not enough to time-reverse the wavefield
on the boundary S. You also have to time-reverse the source term on equation (2.1) and g(r, —f)
indeed verifies the following equation deduced from equation (2.1) where f is replaced by —t:

This means that in order to achieve a perfect time-reversal, both the source has to be transformed into :
a sink (the time-reversal of a source s(r, —f)) and also the field and its normal derivative on surface aa)
S have to be time-reversed. Note that if the source is impulsive one writes s(r,t) = S(r)5(f) and as tw
