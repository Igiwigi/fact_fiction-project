But a recent case has occurred which is perfectly analogous
to that of palladium. A few years ago Professor Lamyaprus,


Platina and Mercury upon each other, 115

in distilling some substances which contained sulphur and
charcoal, obtained a liquid product of a peculiar nature. He
repeated his experiments, but in vain: and after many fruitless
attempts abandoned his researches, and confined himself to
stating the fact tothe chemical world. Little notice was taken
of it, and not much-interest was excited by an experiment 80
likely to fail. Some time after this Mess. CLEMENT and DESoRMES
obtained the same result; and attempted to produce the sub-
stance'a s8econd time. They performed a vast number of ex-
periments ; but ' their Â© 8uccess bore' no proportion to their
diligence and-zeal. They published an account of their process
and'its consequences, but gained little credit, as no person
was fortunate enough to produce the same substance. Many
disbelieved the experiments altogether, and denied the' ex-
istence of such a combination ; whilst others, less inclined to
doubt, attributed its formation to fortuitous circumstances
which might never again occur together. In February, 1804,
