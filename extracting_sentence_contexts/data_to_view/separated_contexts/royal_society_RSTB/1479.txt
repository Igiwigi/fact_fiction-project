REYNOLDS GREEN ON THE ACTION OF

the stored starch, either for immediate consumption in the cell, or for removal to a
more permanent reservoir. There is a good deal to be said for this view ; indeed the authors give some cogent
evidence in support of their hypothesis. If we admit, however, that it is probably
sound, it is insufficient to explain all the facts, for it gives no reason for the actual
diminution of the diastase which can be observed. after a subsequent period of
illumination. \ Pir ‘

From the observations of MaArsHaLt Warb* and other observers who have studied
the effect of light upon the living substance of many micro-organisms, it seems at
least possible that the light to which ‘the leaves are exposed during the daytime may
have a destructive effect upon the enzyme, as it has upon the life of the bacteria and
other lowly forms that-have been investigated. This hypothesis need not, of course,
vitiate the conclusions of Brown and Morris, that diastase is secreted under the
conditions they suggest ; it rather supplements than contravenes them. Some time after the appearance of Brown and Mernis’s memoir, the author
undertook a series of experiments to test the validity of the supposition just put
forward, These have now extended over a period of three years, and have led to
certain conclusions as to the effect of light in general, and of the different regions of
the spectrum in particular, upon the secretion and destruction of diastase, which,
perhaps, throw some light upon other problems connected. with the nutrition of the
vegetable organism. = tea
