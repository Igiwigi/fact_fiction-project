subject to the condition (91) holding for all values of 4, which implies the condition
(72). We shall now prove that if w, is chosen to maximise P, (w») under the condition
(72), then except perhaps for a set of values of ¢ of measure zero, the region w, (4) will
maximise
under the condition (91). That is to say, we shall prove that whatever be the (nm — 1)-
dimensioned region, say v (¢), being a part of the hypersurface ¢ = const. and satisfying

the condition

Suppose in fact that the proposition is not true and that there exists a set E of
values of ¢ of positive measure for which it is possible to define the regions v (¢)
satisfying (99), and such that

P, (7 (4)) = [| palais tas oo ty) dw (4),

Po (v ($)) = & Po (W ($)),
P, (v ($)) = Pi (w (4));

except perhaps for a set of values of 4 of measure zero.
