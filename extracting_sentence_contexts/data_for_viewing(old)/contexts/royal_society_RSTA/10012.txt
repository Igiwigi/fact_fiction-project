difference exists at this pressure as was found at 25 atmospheres.

At 15 atmospheres, also, discrepancies appear to exist between the values given by
different plates for some of the lines, but at this pressure only the measurements for
Group III. are discordant. There is a similar, but less marked, difference between the
values for Group III. at 10 atmospheres ; here it is the plate belonging to Set B that
shows the higher values.

It has been suggested that the phenomenon may be due to different parts of the
are having been focussed upon the slit during the two exposures. Each photograph
is, however, the integration of a number of short exposures due to the intermittent
nature of the arc, and what is obtained on the photographic plate appears to be the
average effect of the whole are; nevertheless, the fact that reversals are found on all
the plates shows that during each exposure we have been dealing with a hot central
core surrounded by an absorbing envelope.

15. The Displacement and the Tendency to Reverse.

There is some evidence that the abnormal displacements measured in the region
between 15 and 30 atmospheres are connected with the great tendency of the lines to
reverse at these pressures. The Displacement Tables, I. and II., in which the lines
which are reversed are distinguished from the rest, show that at 25 and 20 atmospheres,
in Sets A and B respectively, the maximum number of reversals occurs, and the
photographs also indicate that at these pressures the reversals are specially broad
and strong. These are precisely the pressures at which the displacements in the
