Fragments of the wire first furnisghed to me by M. SautRWALD were strongly attracted
by the magnet. The wire furnished by Mr. Becker, when covered with its green lk,
was also attracted, though in a much feebler degree.

I then removed the green ilk covering from the latter and tested the naked wire.
4 was repelled. The whole annoyance was thus fastened on the green ilk; some iron
compound had been used in the dyeing of it; and to this the deviation of my needle
from zero was manifestly due.

T had the green coating removed and the wire overspun with white ilk, clean hands
being used in the process. A perfect galvanometer is the result. The needle, when
released from the action of a current, returns accurately to zero, and is perfectly free
from all magnetic action on the part of the coil. In fact while we have been devyising

agate plates and other elaborate methods to get rid of the great nuisance of a magnetic
coil *, the means of doing 80 are at hand. Nothing is more easy to be found than
diamagnetic copper wire. Ont of eleven specimens, four of which were furnished by
Mr. BrcxeR, and seven taken at random from our laboratory, nine were found diamag-
netic and only two magnetic.
