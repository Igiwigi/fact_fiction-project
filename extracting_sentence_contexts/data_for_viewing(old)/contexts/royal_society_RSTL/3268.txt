object corresponded to the arch (bb?) represented in fig. 122. and if 80, what has
been already stated (par. 216.) on the continuity of that arch with the subsequently
vascular lamina of the umbilical vesicle, will be applicable here. Farther, the object
bl? in fig. 124. occupied a situation not very remote from that of the future great
blood-yessels and the heart.

220. The continnity already pointed out (pars. 196. 201—206. 216. 219.) between
the peripheral portion of the germ (Plate VII. figs. 121 A. 121 B. 122. 124. bb?,) and the
subsequently vascular lamina of the umbilical vesicle (bb? in the same figures, and
in figs. 119. 120. 121; also in Plate VIII. figs. 132 and 150.), appears to me to go
very far towards explaining why observers have hitherto supposed the embryo to
arise in the substance of a membrane, I would ask particular attention to the fol-
lowing recapitulation of sevyeral of the facts recorded in this memoir; viz. The dark
spot designated by Cosrt the © Tache embryonnaire,” obviously corresponds to my
< peripheral portion of the germ” (which has the central portion (bb') lying under,
and often very much concealed by it). The germ sends forth a hollow process (Plate VI.
fig. 117. bb”). This process, expanding, receives the yelk into its interior, lines the
membrane am. as a network (Plate VII. fig. 119. bb? Plate VIII. fig. 132.), and passing
through the stages represented in Plate VII. figs. 120 and 121, subsequently assumes
the state exhibited in Plate VIII. fig. 150, which appears to be the immediate founda-
tion of the hlood-vessels and the blood. The stage shown in Plate VIL. fig. 121. is
repeated on a smaller scale in fig. 121 A. Here, and in figs. 121 B. and 122, the sepa-
rate granules (nuclei) surrounded by dark globules (bb?) were seen to be a part of the
layer constituted by the peripheral portion of the germ (bb?) (* tache embryonnaire” of
Cosrs). External to the structures now described is the membrane am, (Plate VI.
