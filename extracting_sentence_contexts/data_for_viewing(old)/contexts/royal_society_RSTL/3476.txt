The twenty-third equiyalent of hydrogen is here eliminated and replaced by
oxide of lead, the true formula of the erythrolitmine is therefore C,; Hy, O,z.

It is evident that this substance belongs to the same series of bodies as the ery-
throlein and the erythroleic acid, the relation of the carbon and hydrogen being
the same, the oxygen, however, having increased to twelve equivalents. That this
body is a direct product of the oxidation of erythroleic acid, is completely shown by
the fact, that if semifluid erythroleic acid be left exposed to the air for s0me weeks,
it gradually solidifies ; it is then insoluble in ether, is coloured blue by ammonia,
and is, in fact, found to have been changed into erythrolitmine. The bodies are
therefore related to each other as the two orceines,

The origin of erythrolein is a point on which, however, I do not at all feel perfectly
decided. It will be recollected how beautifully simple the production of erythroleic
acid from roccelline appeared to be, two equivalents of hydrogen being replaced by
two of oxygen. The production of erythrolein does not appear to me by any means 80
easily explained. The relation between roccelline and erythrolein is extremely simple.
