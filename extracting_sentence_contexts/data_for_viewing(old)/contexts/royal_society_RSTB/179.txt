We have in several instances effected the removal of the greater part of the
temporo-sphenoidal lobe. Our object in most of these experiments was to get at the
hippocampal region in order to remove or destroy the hippocampus and uncinate gyrus,
a lesion which had only been performed hitherto by Ferrier, partly in conjunction
with Yxro, and which in the hands of those observers was followed by hemianzesthesia

* Luorant (‘On the Sensorial Localisations in the Cortex Cerebri,” ‘Brain,’ vol. 7) appears disposed
to regard these cases as being due to injury of an extension of the visual region into the temporal lobe.
But, since the main centre for vision (in the occipital lobe) is intact, one would scarcely expect hemiopia
to result from the removal of an outlying part !

¢ A further investigation upon this region and into the parts of the cortex which are connected with
other special sense functions is, in fact, now being carried on by one of us, in the hope of succeeding
in clearing up some of the discrepancies in the evidence of previous observers. We may perhaps here
most conveniently notice a statement which has been made by Dr. Ferrier in the second edition of his
‘Functions of the Brain,’ to the effect that we had removed the occipital lobes on one or both sides
“ without the slightest appreciable impairment of vision.” It will be seen from the text, and from our
Record of Cases, that this is a mistake. It appears to have arisen solely from a misunderstanding, for,
whereas we informed Dr, Frrrier that we had not been able to determine that this lesion produced any
permanent impairment of vision, he understood, it would seem, that we had not obtained any effect
whatever.
