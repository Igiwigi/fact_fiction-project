Both used optical methods. Their results, together with the corresponding
curve computed by Fundaminsky, are illustrated in figure 3a.{ The transitions 3°S'—> 3°D

+ In the reduction of his measurements Christoph did not allow for the temperature of the sodium vapour;
but by using information he gives it was possible to apply the necessary correction.

t Entirely different results have been reported by Michels (1931), who claimed that type XY peaks occur

for this and for other transitions. His work is ignored, since his technique is rendered extremely suspect by
the fact that it gave vanishingly small cross-sections at energies slightly above the critical potentials.

and 3%S-> 4*S have not been studied experimentally, but Haft has investigated the emission
from the 42D and 52S levels.
