I do not know whether, when the yolk is used up in embryogeny, the M-yolk
spheres disappear completely or transform back again into mitochondria. GATENBY
(12) finds that the latter is the case in Limnea stagnalis. He says :—‘* Careful examina-
tion of the mitochondria in the unsegmented egg and in the advanced differentiating
organ or germ-layer seems to establish the fact that the mitochondria shrink gradually
in size pari passu with the differentiating somatic or germ-cells during any stazes I
have examined.” If this is the case also in the bird the M-yolk spheres would be entitled
to be considered as living cell-bodies, and not as deutoplasmic globules. In any case
there are probably a large number of mitochondria which persist unchanged throughout
oogenesis and in the embryonic cells after segmentation.
