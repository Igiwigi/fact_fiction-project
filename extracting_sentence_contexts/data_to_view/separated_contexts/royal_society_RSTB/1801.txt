In point of segmentation of
the cells which give rise to them, there is very great diversity of detail, though it
appears that, as in other Pteridophyta, the essential part of the sporangia is referable
in origin to superficial cells. But beyond this, in form and size of the sporangium, in
the number of sporogenous cells, in the details of septation, and even in the details of
dehiscence, there is an absence of constancy. Though many of the characters provide
material for speculation, which will be taken up later, one conclusion may at least be

drawn from the facts (it is, indeed, a mere summary of them), viz., that the sorus and
sporangium of Dana are distinctly non-specialised, perhaps more obviously non-
specialised than those of any other living Pteridophyte. Summary of Data from Study of Danza.

(t.) The sori consist of numerous sporangia, arranged in two parallel rows, united
into an oblong cake-like mass, partially overarched by indusia, which spring up
between the sori, from the surface of the leaf.

(2.) The sori are not always strictly circumscribed, but are liable to abstriction,
resulting in shorter, sometimes circular, sori.

(3.) The sporogenous tissue, together with the part of the wall immediately above
it, arises by segmentation of superficial cells. Usually one such cetl (the superficial
parent-cell) supplies the whole sporogenous tissue of each sporangium,

(4.) There is a great, variety of detail in the segmentation, and in the size of the
resulting groups of sporogenous tissue; hardly any two are exactly alike.
