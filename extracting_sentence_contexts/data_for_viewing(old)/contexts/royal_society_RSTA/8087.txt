3. Densities of Organic Crystals.

Since the volume susceptibility of the balancing solution gives at once that of the
crystal along the field, it remains only to know the density of the crystal in order to
calculate the corresponding gram molecular susceptibility. On a reference to the
standard literature, one finds that the values for the densities of organic crystals given
by different experimenters vary widely. This is not surprising; even in the case of
substances which can be obtained in the form of large single crystals, Turron* remarks
that measurements on several crystals are made and the highest value is adopted. The
difficulties of measurement on organic substances, which are usually in the form of
micro-crystals, are naturally greater, and hence the above discrepancies. In fact, it
has been suggested by Brace} that the calculation of the density from the size of the
unit cell determined by X-ray methods is likely to give a more accurate value than
direct methods of measurement.

Thus it is clear that in our calculation of the gram molecular susceptibility of a crystal
from its volume susceptibility we have to use the proper value of the density for the
particular crystal used. This was determined by the “ immersion” method, using a
solution of zine sulphate for the purpose.

The following observation made in the course of the measurements on densities
appears to be worth mentioning. By taking a large erystal and continually subdividing
it, the density of the heaviest piece is found to be considerably higher than that of the
