We expect this difference would grow on
longer timescales. Moreover the electric field profile was dominated by a very narrow peak in
this case (figure 1) which is a numerical artefact of the flux limiter. This is due to the fact that the
flux limiter causes an artificial transport barrier, steepening the temperature profile unphysically,
leading to the strong peak in the electric field. Figure 2 shows that this feature is absent from
the more physically correct VFP simulations. 2D CTC simulations showed that this unphysical
transport barrier did indeed modify the rate of B-field generation by the Biermann battery, leading
to an increase in the magnitude of the magnetic field by a factor of two after 60ps of laser
heating for f = 0.05 compared to f = 0.15. This suggests that our MHD predictions of the magnetic
field from the Biermann battery are dominated by a numerical artefact (the flux limiter induced
transport barrier).
