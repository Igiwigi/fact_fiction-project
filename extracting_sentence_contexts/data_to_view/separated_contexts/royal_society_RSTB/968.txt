It is to be noted that when only few specks of blood are seen they are confined to
rn wall of the uterus, or are more numerous there, and it is only when they
plentiful that they occupy both walls in equal proportions. This circumstance
ndicates that the increased supply of blood, which is a marked feature during
menstruation, affects the dorsal before it affects the ventral walls, a supposition
which is confirmed by histological examination. The fact that during pregnancy the dorsal disc of the bilobed placenta is developed
faster than the ventral disc is in harmony with this statement. : In the cavity of the uterus there is no discharge from the glands during Stage IIL. ;
