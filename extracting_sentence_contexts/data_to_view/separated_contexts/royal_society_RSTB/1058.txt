It was specially noted that the superior medullary velum, which forms the des!
portion of the superior peduncle, retained a perfectly normal appearance, |v
importance of this fact will be pointed out when the constitution of the cereb
peduncles is again under discussion. (See p. 753.)

The degenerations just described corroborate the view that the brachium conjie-
tivum is an efferent tract, passing from the lateral lobe of the cerebellum tole
