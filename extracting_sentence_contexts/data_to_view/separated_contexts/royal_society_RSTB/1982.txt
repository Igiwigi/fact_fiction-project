Within an hour long
chains had formed and there was no further sign of motility. I was utterly at
A a loss to reconcile these observations with what I knew of the organism so far, and I
was driven to the conclusion that in preparing the cells I had used a contaminated
broth. Nevertheless one important fact militated against this theory. After the
cultures were made, examination showed that every drop contained from 20 to 100
or more spores; when examined the next morning very few spores were visible in
any of the drops, while every one showed an abundance of motile rods. The whole
experiment was at once repeated under as nearly as possible the same conditions,
but without success, because the spores sown in the evening had, by the following
morning, produced long chains.
