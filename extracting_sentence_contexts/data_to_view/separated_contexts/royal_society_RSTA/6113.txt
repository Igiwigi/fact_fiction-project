On the other hand, to turn a low
algorithmic complexity network into a higher algorithmic complexity network, stochastically
random single-edge deletion suffices [27]. A formal observer system © is a particular type of FDDDS that has prior knowledge of a
formal theory and can simulate Turing machines (or compute functions) during its state space
trajectory. Thus, as demonstrated in [1, Section 3.2], whether or not a formal observer system can
compute a certain function is a fact dependent on the prior formal knowledge that the formal
observer system knows. This is an important property that we will explore in §3a. A direct
consequence of the definitions of algorithmic perturbation and formal observer system is that
they enable an algorithmic perturbation to change the machine that 0 is simulating ([1], Lemma
3.1).
