In Chorophilus feriarum, where, according
to Wilder, the constrictor posterior has atrophied, the pulvinaria are apparently also
absent ; at least Blume, who describes pulvinaria in the species possessing them, does
not mention them in his account of Chorophilus. In Eupemphix nana, in which the
ventral half of m. constrictor posterior is lacking, the ventral pulvinaria are very small
and weak, quite unlike the large, tough ventral pulvinaria in the closely related
Physalemus cuvieri. Thus the view stated above of the function of the pulvinaria is confirmed by the
fact that where there is no constrictor posterior there are also no pulvinaria. Discoglosside and Liopelmide. The Discoglosside and Liopelma have short tongues, not adapted for swift, accurate
movements, and the hyoglossal muscle is comparatively weak and short, having its
origin on the anterior part of the postero-medial process, whereas in other Phaneroglossa
it is at the posterior end, at least in adults.
