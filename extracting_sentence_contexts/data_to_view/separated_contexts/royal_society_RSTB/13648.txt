Thus, normalization of
SNPs is largely a matter of convention; for F-statistics the depen-
dency on additional samples (through mean allele frequencies)
is often unwanted, but could be advantageous for tools that aim
to do joint inference from many F-statistics such as qpAdm
[38,40]. As genetic differentiation between human populations
is low, the normalization used may matter little in practice,
but could be explored in future work [28].

(ii) Estimated versus observed allele frequencies

The third difference between F-statistics and PCA is on the
usage of estimated allele frequencies versus individual-based
genotypes. The fact that PCA does not distinguish between
sampling error and the underlying structure is a well-known
drawback of PCA, and applying the theory presented here
to individual-based PCA would result in F-statistics that incor-
porate some sampling noise. Probabilistic PCA is one class of
approaches that aim to separate the population structure from
sampling noise (e.g. [66]). It seems likely that probabilistic PCA
would yield a representation of the data that is more closely
aligned with F-statistics than regular PCA.

(iv) Individual versus population-based analyses

The final issue is that PCA is commonly run on individual-
based data, whereas F-statistics often group individuals into
populations.
