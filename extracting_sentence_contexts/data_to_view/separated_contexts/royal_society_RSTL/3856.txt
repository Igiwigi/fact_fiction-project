22 DR. ANDREWS ON THE THERMAL CHANGES

mixed together, is a question of yery great difficulty, requiring the previous determi-
nation of many data, all of which are in few instances capable of being discovered by
experiment. The liquids before mixture are, in fact, solutions of the acid and alkali
in the state of hydrates, and as large quantities of heat were evolyed during the
formation of these hydrates, and generally also during their subsequent solation, an
equal absorption of heat, will take place when these combinations are destroyed. A
further allowance is also required for the effect of the solution of the resulting com-
pound. After making all these corrections it is doubtful whether the result finally
obtained would not be a theoretical or imaginary number.
