render their discussion of interest. Apparently, also, little or no effect upon the a
length is produced by impregnating the ova in solutions of uric acid or previous ferti.
lisation water, and no effect seems to be produced by changes in the composition
the gases dissolved in the water. In those cases where such an additional amount o}
sperma was added as to render the water putrid, the arm lengths are considerabl
decreased, but otherwise they are probably not influenced either by a decrease or a
increase in the amount present.
Though the evidence drawn from the variations produced in the arm lengths of th
larvee is not nearly so trustworthy as that for the body length, probably because o
the greater sensitiveness of the tissues of the arms to slight changes in the environ
ment, yet the number of different observations made in several cases affords a con
siderable degree of certainty to some of the conclusions arrived at. Probably the
most striking point of these conclusions lies in the fact that opposite effects on thi
arm and body lengths are frequently produced by the same change of environmental
condition. The effects brought about by rise of temperature and dilution of the watet
during development are especially noticeable.
Both the aboral and oral arm lengths of the larvee were determined, in order that
the effect of environment on the relation between the two might be examined. W.
have seen that in the case of an increased temperature during development, the ora
arm length is not so much affected as the aboral, and hence, the ratio between
two is increased. In the other observations it may also be noticed that as a rule th
oral arm length is not affected to so great a degree as the aboral. The reason of thi
is obvious. The measurement taken as to the oral arm length is made up in part o
the true oral arm length, and in part of the body tissues, whereas the aboral 2
length measurement is made up only in a very slight degree of the body tissues.
