As a proof that our atmosphere is
a mixture, and not a compound, no experiment with which I am acquainted matches in
point of conclusiveness that which demonstrates the deportment of dry air to radiant heat. But the molecules which can thus intercept the waves of ether must be shaken by
those waves, possibly shaken asunder. That ordinary thermometric heat provokes
chemical actions is one of the commonest facts of observation. These actions, considered
from a physical point of view, are changes of molecular position and arrangement con-
sequent on the acceptance of motion from the source of heat, Radiant heat also, if
sufficiently intense and if absorbed with sufficient avidity, could produce all the effects
of ordinary thermometric heat. The dark rays, for example, which can make platinum
white-hot, could also, if absorbed, produce the chemical effects of white-hot platinum.
