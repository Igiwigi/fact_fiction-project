y. The Formation of the Pores.—In Echinus miliaris the tube-feet are budded off one
by one (alternately) from the radial canal. As each is budded off a calcareous plate
is laid down above (aborally) to it. This ambulacral plate increases in size and grows
round the developing tube-foot to form the greater part of the pore. ‘The lower border
is formed by the preceding plate (GorDon, 1926, fig. 20, p. 288).

In Echinocardium, on the other hand, a relatively large number of ambulacral plates
are laid down in the pluteus quite independently of tube-feet (figs. 2 and 16). Thus, in
the imago, only five ambulacral plates out of a total of fifty-five (see numbers given for
imago C (‘Table 1) on p. 263) possess pores. After metamorphosis, ambulacral plates
are added rapidly, while tube-feet make their appearance very, very slowly (figs. 17,
19, 20, 9, 11, 12 and 13). Since the plates precede the tube-feet the pores must be formed
in a different way from those of Echinus. They are, in fact—with the exception of those
belonging to the first five tube-feet—formed by resorption of part of the test from within
to accommodate the developing tube-feet. The ambulacral plates are, in young
specimens, considerably thinner in the parts where the pores will later be formed than
elsewhere. The pores of the petaloid portions and of the modified “ petal ” also appear
to be formed in the same way, although the tube-feet appear soon after the ambulacral
plates have been laid down and while the plates are still small. The ocular pores are
formed in a different way. The plate is at first dorsal to the oculus, and later grows
right round it.

D.—The Fasciolar Spines.

In the early stages all the spines are formed in exactly the same way as the typical
