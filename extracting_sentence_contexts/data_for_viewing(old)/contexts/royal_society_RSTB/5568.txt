than are the spines of Psilophyton. In so far, however, as they also show features
comparable with the emergences of the latter plant, they suggest that, with further
investigation, evidence may be forthcoming of a natural gradation between emergences
and small simple leaves. Should this prove to be the case it would define by examples
and perhaps help to solve historically one of the most fundamental problems in the
morphology of the shoot ; that concerning the contrast of typically megaphyllous plants,
such as the Ferns, and typically microphyllous plants, such as the Lycopods.

This question has been discussed by various morphologists both on general com-
parative grounds and in special connection with Early Devonian plants. It will not
be entered into fully here. The present state of our knowledge regarding the small
leaves of existing Vascular Cryptogams and of Thursophyton and Asteroxylon may,
however, be referred to in order to indicate how the facts for Psilophyton, by adding to
the rather limited sources of evidence, bear on the general problem,

The small, simple appendages of Lycopodium, to take this plant as an illustration of the
