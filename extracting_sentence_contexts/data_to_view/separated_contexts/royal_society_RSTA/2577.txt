As this
happens, the density of the residual melt decreases and as a result, the density of the melt trapped
in the pore space between the crystals will also gradually decrease (figure 2b). This leads to a
decrease in the melt density for crystal fractions less than about 70%, and will lead to a decrease
in the bulk density of the cumulate layer with time as the trapped melt becomes progressively
less dense. In the Iceland case, the melt is much denser, and the plagioclase crystals which precipitate are
in fact less dense than the melt. As a result, the melt density actually increases with crystallization
once the crystal fraction exceeds about 10% and plagioclase comes on to the liquidus. The
occurrence of an Icelandic melt density minimum at the onset of plagioclase crystallization was
identified recently by Hartley & Maclennan [33].
