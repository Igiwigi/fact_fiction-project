Midway between the rows of two snccessive $piral series of leaves are found rows,
also spiral, of the scars of flower-stalks (Plate XIX. fig. 1 c), distinguished from those of
the leaves by the absence of the root-scars beneath them, by their round section, their
smaller size, the different arrangement of their air-canals, and, moreover, by the fact
that they are not supported by a firm internal process, derived from the central 8ub-
stance of the stem. These are the principal points seen on the ontside of the stem ;
it may be added, that the habit of growth is just what the arrangement of its struc-
tures would lead us to suppose ; it grows by the continuous development of a terminal
bud alone, which, like that of a Palm, throws out leaf after leaf in a spiral course,
each leaf being furnished with a branch-like process of the central vascular s8ub-
stance, which remains as a projection, marked by the scar of the leaf and its bundle
of roots after these have fallen off. The scars of the flower-stalks are remarkable for
being 80 far distant from the axils of the leaves, which must be supposed to subtend
them, and it appears to me that the flower-buds do not become developed until the
leaves of the series above them, as well as of that below them, have been perfected.
