8 (inclusion) mapping of the space H(p) onto the subset H(p) of the space H(R) is continuous,
} the topology of H(p) being finer than that of H/ (R). Hence H(p) is either of the first category

q It is instructive to consider the statement of topological theorems when interpreted in

3 terms of H(D). If f(z) = Sa,z"e H(p), then the corollary to theorem 1-1 shows that the

obtained by an application of Schwarz and Cauchy’s inequalities (strong form), but the
corresponding inequality for, say, H(C) with Faber polynomials as base, is less obvious.

We have seen above that the vector space H(r) can be regarded as the dual of an ¥-space
