in the bracts of the male cone.

Various stages in the development of the bundle of the young bracts have been
studied.* It was found that in a few cases near the apex of the male cone the
transfusion-tissue elements in the mesophyll were lignified before the xylem, but this
was unusual, and even here the sheath of transfusion elements round the bundle arises
later. Usually the xylem is lignified first, and the transfusion tissue is developed
later. The order of lignification of the xylem elements is not very regular. In the
bracts of the female cone studied, the xylem was generally all centrifugal. In those
of the male cone, it was often noticed that a laterally disposed element became
lignified first and that the later developed elements extended from it in a more or
less straight line parallel to the surface of the bract.t Occasionally a few xylem
elements are centripetally developed, but this fact has probably no significance. In
the next stage transfusion tracheides are developed outside the phloem,} and give the
bundle a concentric appearance in transverse section, but later still a complete ring
of lignified elements surrounds both the xylem and phloem of the collateral bundle,

In the young bract, the hypoderm of sclerenchyma under the inner epidermis is
formed early, but the branched and lignified cells under the outer epidermis do not
arise till later. It is also at this later stage that the cuticular ridges on the stomata
are developed.

B. Male Flower.

The flower consists of an outer whorl of two small bracts, an inner whorl of two
