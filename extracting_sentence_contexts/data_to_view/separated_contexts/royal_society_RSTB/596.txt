T. L. BRUNTON AND J. T. CASH ON THE CONNECTION

ExposurE To VApouR OF THE BENZENE Compounps. The original experiments of BrrecEr,* who showed how readily poisoning in Frogs
might be induced by placing the animals in solutions of resorcin and its isomers,
demonstrated the fact that by cutaneous absorption these substances are highly
lethal. Curistranit has demonstrated in the same manner the poisonous action of
benzol. The literature of pyrogallol abounds with instances of poisoning produced
by the application of the drug applied in the form of ointment to the human body,
The inhalation and cutaneous contact of the vapour of nitrobenzene have caused
poisoning, and anilin when brought into contact with raw surfaces, as in the treat-
ment of skin diseases, and more especially when its vapour has been inhaled, has
produced its characteristic poisonous effects.
