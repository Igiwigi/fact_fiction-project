If the rate of
supply of nutrients diminished, for example, as the distance of the apex from the source of
supply increased, the shoot would have an attenuated or tapering form. But if the rate of
supply of nutrients to the meristem were accelerated, it would undergo a progressive
increase in size and the shoot would become an enlarging obconical structure. This ob-
conical development is, in fact, a characteristic feature not only of vascular plants, but of
plants in general (Bower 1922). Qualitative as well as quantitative variations in the supply
of metabolites may also be expected to induce changes in the morphological development. The general inference to be drawn from the experimental studies described here is that
the shoot type of organization can in the main be referred to non-hereditary factors, i.e. its
occurrence in different phyletic lines is the result of development under the influence of
the same or similar physical and physiological factors.

(e) The lateral organs

The lateral organs in ferns (leaves, scales and buds) are normally formed in specific
positions (except the scales) and at different levels on the growing point.
