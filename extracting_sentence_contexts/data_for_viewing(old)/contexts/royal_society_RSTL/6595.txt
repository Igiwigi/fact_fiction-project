Since G=D\(H), the resolved part of G along! any fixed line will be the differential
coefficient of the resolved part of H along that line ; or, it. other words, the 8wm of the
moments of the external forces about any line equals the differential coefficient of the
sum of the moments of the momenta of the body's particles.

The above results may be easily deduced from the ordinary equations

But it will be generally found far better not to use those six equations at all, and
simply to bear in mind the fact which they alone express, namely, that P=D(U),
G=D\(H):

52. It will be convenient to recapitulate once for all the notation and phraseology L
$hall constantly use in the sequel. The system of momenta of a body's particles, or
what may be called the body's momenta-system, is reducible, if we treat the momenta. as
forces, to a momentum at a point O, and a couple of momenta. 'The former I call the
body's momentum, and denote it by U ; the latter T call the body's momentum-couple about
O. and denote its axis by H. U and H may both be represented by straight lines
through the origin O. It is to be observed that U remains the same wherever O be
taken, but that H changes with the position of O.

The components of U and H along the axes of coordinates will be denoted by
