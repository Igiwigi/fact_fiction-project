This idea of Fresnex’s seems, at first sight, essentially to involve the condensation of ether by matter,
80 that its density inside bodies is n?; for the fixed ether is superposed upon the normal ether of
ee. (Certainly the converse is true; viz., that extra ethereal density involves Fresnut’s law, as will
be shortly shown.) - Now the facts of gravitation, and many electrostatic experiments, suggest that the ether is practically
hcompressible ; hence the notion of any actual increase of density,inside gross matter is repugnant,
Presyen, however, himself pointed out, in a subsequently written postscript to his original letter
0 Anago* promulgating his famous hypothesis, that the extra density need not be taken too literally. As this postscript seems rather to have been overlooked it may be worth while to quote it). _“ Note additionnelle a la lettre de M. Frusnen d M. Araco, insérée dans le dernier Cahier des Annales.
