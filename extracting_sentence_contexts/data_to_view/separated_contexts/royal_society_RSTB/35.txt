Turning then to Myrmecobius, with its eight or nine cheek-teeth, of which only three
are commonly reckoned as premolars, I examined several young specimens in order to
see if this animal, like the abnormal Phascologale, had not really four premolars, as no
exact observations on it had been published, and the usual determination rested
merely on the shape of the teeth. In fact, even if no tooth-change could be found, it
seemed possibile enough that the small tooth commonly reckoned as the first molar
should be really a persistent milk pm‘, the permanent tooth corresponding to it having
become aborted.* This theory, however, I have been able to disprove by the exami-
