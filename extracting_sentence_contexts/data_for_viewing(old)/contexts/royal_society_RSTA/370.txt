fundamental physics, empirical assumptions have to be made in order to represent
what are essentially sub-gridscale processes at the resolved scale of the model. The
usual approach is to define what are called bulk formulae, which seek to represent

empirically the statistical properties of the sub-gridscale processes and how they
relate to the large-scale, resolved state of the atmosphere (or ocean). Traditionally,
a deterministic approach has been taken to define these bulk formulae and their
closure parameters, despite the fact that considerable uncertainty exists and
observations suggest a significant range of possible formulations and values.

Therefore, it is clear that uncertainty in the model itself, and systematic biases
in the model’s simulation lead to restricted sampling of the forecast phase space
and under-dispersion in the ensemble. Early studies investigated the role of model
uncertainty and used random perturbations to the increments from the physical
parametrizations, time step by time step [7], while other approaches used random
variations to the closure parameters in the physical parametrizations. These
were based on a range of observational estimates and expert judgement, and
were kept fixed throughout the particular simulation—the perturbed parameter
approach. Both led to some improvements in the ensemble spread, but as will be
discussed later, the perturbed parameter approach has proved more valuable in
