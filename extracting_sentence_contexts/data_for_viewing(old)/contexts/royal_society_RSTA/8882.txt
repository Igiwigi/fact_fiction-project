an incandescent lamp filtered through a solution of iodine in carbon disulphide of such
strength as to make the lamp quite invisible through it. Evidently when water vapour
is present the threshold frequency can lie in the infra-red part of the spectrum.

§ 9.—Analysis of the Curves.

The obvious way of attacking the problem of the distribution of kinetic energy among
the emitted electrons is to take the curves, such as figs. 4, 7 and 12, and find the incre-
ments in current corresponding to equally spaced intervals dV along the voltage axis.
These will be proportional to the number of electrons whose energies lie between eV
and e (V + dV). This method will certainly give correctly, to the degree of accuracy
within which it can be operated and to the accuracy within which V is known, the
distribution of velocity among the electrons as they in fact reach the receiving electrode.

34 PROF. O. W. RICHARDSON ON THE EMISSION OF ELECTRONS

It is not so reliable a guide to the distribution among the electrons as emitted at the
source, on account of the difficulty in estimating the effects of the factors enumerated
on p. 11 ante, which tend to prevent the attainment of saturation at zero field, in modi-
fying that distribution before the electrons reach the receiving electrode. The picture
may also be distorted owing to the inexact location of the true zero of potential differ-
ence. A study of similar phenomena, as displayed by thermionically emitted electrons,
