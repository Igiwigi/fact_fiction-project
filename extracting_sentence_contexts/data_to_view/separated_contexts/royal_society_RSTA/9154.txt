Table IV., vary for spheres from 209 to 175. This is due to the fact that as more
wrappings are used, the masses, M, M, can be swung through less angle; hence the
range is reduced. Thus we have some eight degrees of wrapping indicated in the
above table.

(c) The outer layer of cotton wool was covered with tin-foil, and several experiments
were performed in which the parts of the helix coverings, near the hot spheres, M, M,
were sprayed with tap water every two minutes. The experiments on dates 18th
August, 1915, and 19th August, 1915, in Table IV., were conducted thus.
