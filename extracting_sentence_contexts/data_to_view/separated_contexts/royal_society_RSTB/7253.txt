The result is that fatigue may cause mistakes to be made long before the
visual limit is approached. Further, when the limit is nearly reached, mistakes usually do
not increase in a regular manner with decrease in the visual angle of the test object. These
facts make the precise determination of visual acuity difficult. In order to decrease fatigue,
and in consequence to increase accuracy, the following method may sometimes be adopted. In the case of a letter of the alphabet, or a character similar to it, its diagonal is measured
to the nearest millimetre.
