It is, however, perhaps not going too far to say that as yet no
Katisfactory explanation of the phenomena has been suggested, and that we are now
Sjust as far from knowing as we were twenty years ago, what are the different conditions
Zunder which some eggs remain undeveloped unless they are brought under the influence
Zof the spermatozoa, while others contain within themselves the power of producing
Z oung without the necessity of any external stimulus. Still, though we have been
.2unable to obtain any insight into the philosophy of the s8ubject, we have in this period
Scollected together a great mass of facts which will perhaps ere long lead us to some
Satisfactory conclusion. E& In a paper *On the Double Method of Reproduction in Daphnia*,” IT lately
Zendeavoured to show that eggs and buds are in fact identical, that they are the two
<Sextremes of a long series, and that therefore every intermediate gradation between them
Swill probably exist or has existed in nature. I however suggested that it would pro-
—bably * be convenient to apply some distinguishing name to those eggs which do not
Zrequire impregnation as a necessary antecedent to development,” and Professxor HuxLEY
Shas since proposed to call them Pseudovaf.
