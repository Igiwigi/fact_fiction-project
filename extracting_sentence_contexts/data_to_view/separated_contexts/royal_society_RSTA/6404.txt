Case
numbers decreased after implementation of the NPIs. However, this decrease occurred against
declining background infection rates and the vaccination status of the population studied in
Dancer et al. [19] changed over the study period. These reasons, along with the fact that multiple
NPIs (including screening, masking etc.) were simultaneously applied, preclude confident
conclusions regarding ventilation alone from these studies.

(i) Air cleaning devices

All of the four studies that considered the effectiveness of air cleaning devices reported evidence
for reduced viral transmission [17,26-28]. However, in one of the reports by Cheng et al. [26], the
differences between the populations studied made it hard to establish a clear association. Positive association: The only controlled laboratory experiments identified in this review were
undertaken by Fischer et al. [27] and Zhang et al. [28], and they showed a positive association
between air cleaning and reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
