In fact, the above sets enclose all linear combinations of moments belonging to each set, i.e.
their raw, Hermite, central and central Hermite version—a fortiori, it does not extend to non-
linear combinations of moments such as cumulants. In addition to Levermore’s sets of moments, :
restrictions to third-order moments (and their linear combinations) were proposed in the context :B
of moment approaches:

— 13-moment:
(L, Siar SinSip, Six Six Fie), (2.23)
— 20-moment:
