Dituinished hydrostatic pressure conditions an expansion of the yolume of
gis in the nir-bladder, which will ultimately result im the transmission of a stimulus
to the sensory epithelium of the internal ear, and the initiation of aflerent impulses in
the auditory nerve. The afferent inmpalses may find their final expression im the
peristaltic contraction of the walls of the pneumatic duct and the expulsion in suo-
cessive bubbles of an amount of air that will suffice to restore equilibrium at a new
level. It is probable that the pneumatic duct is not to be regarded as a mere channel
for the escape of gas from the air-bladder, but rather as a structure which, under
reflex control, actively participates in the process, and, ab the same time, regulates
the quantity of the expelled air, Slight reductions of pressure, the result of equally
slight variations of level, may not necessarily lead to an eseape of nix, for probably no
inconveniences to the locomotion of the Fish would result from them, in fact, the
tortuosity of the pneumatic duct, aided, it may be, by a special sphincter, can be
regurded aa of the nature of a safegnard to prevent the innecessary elimination of gas
under such conditions, But more extensive reductions of pressure may ab ance call
into play the reflex mechunism to secure the necessary readjustment to the more
enperticial level. That the reflex mechanism is under the direct. control of some:
