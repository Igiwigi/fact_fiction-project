The effect is probably caused by a slight disturbance whilst the erystal was
forming, one part being moved relatively to another when the metal between them
was still molten. Such a disturbance might be brought about by external causes,
such as a shaking of the mould, or by stresses set up as the metal cooled. The
difference of orientation is still further brought out by the fact that the acid has
acted more strongly where the two portions jom than upon the surrounding area;
this etching out has produced furrows, which appear as the dark bands in fig. 2.
Such an action is always seen between two patches of different orientation, and

where the difference is great, as it is between two crystals, a furrow which can
he easily seen without any magnification is produced.
