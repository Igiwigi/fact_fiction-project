In the analogous problem of cyclic irrotational motion in fluids, with the cire'
tion guided by rigid ring-cores, the circulations which correspond formally to
electric currents remain constant in the free motion, and so must be analyticall,
momenta, and not velocities. The energy in this vortex problem is given by the
same formula as in the electric problem, but it must be modified by change of it

before the forcives are derived from it ; and thus the circumstance, first empha-
sized by Lord Ketviy, that the forcives between such rigid ring-cores are equal
but opposite to the forcives between the analogous rigid conductors carrying electric
ents, must find its explanation i in the fact that the electric currents are of the type
of velocities, while the fluid circulations are of the type of momenta.

6. In the dynamics of the circulation of a fluid through ring-shaped solids, the
expression for the energy in terms of vortex filaments,

T = $3)lo,oyrâ€”! cos eds, ds,

=f epresents its proper distribution with respect to each solid as a whole, but does not
9 represent its distribution as regards each element of a vortex filament. Thus, when
5 the solids are treated as rigid bodies, and are referred to the appropriate number of
S coordinates (six for each), this expression for the energy is competent to determine
se the aggregate forcive on each solid. But it is not competent to express the actual
