conversion of the calicoblast cell into inorganic deposit, and gave figures with fibre
and granule-containing cells. The crystalline “ spheroids” and “ellipsoids” of Kocu
might possibly, he suggested, be formed by the combination of a number of the
changed calicoblasts.

Although Herpsr had made thin transverse microscopic sections of Cladoeora, he
did not advance our knowledge of the fine structure of the mature skeleton beyond
the stage which KéuurKer had reached. In fact, Heroer frankly admits in his
paper, in 1886, that he is at a loss to account for the difference between the simple
deposit observed in the embryonic skeletal disc, and the various complex structures
of the mature skeleton. He surmises “ that the individual skeletal parts in the
Madreporaria are formed in a manner analogous with the skeleton of Alcyonarians,”
but that in the former the calicoblasts produce a connected calcareous layer at the
outer limit of the mesoderm, “ whereas the analogous cells in the Alcyonarian polyp
form, us is well known, calcareous spicules, which remain isolated throughout the
whole life of the polyp” (loc, cit., p. 180).

This surmise of Hrrprr’s shows that he stood much in the same position with
regard to the skeleton of Aleyonarians and Madreporarians, as E>warps and Harms
had done thirty years before. Instead of the “ sclerenchymatous nodule ” (equiv.
