anterior pituitary gland acts similarly by its hormone or hormones upon the gonads.
We have seen, further, that in the female there may be secondary or dioestrous cycles
within the major cycle and that these also are dependent upon the ovarian hormones
which are successively produced. Further, the duration of the corpus luteum
depends partly, at any rate, on the anterior pituitary, as shown especially in such
species as the rat. As to whether the ovarian hormones react upon the anterior
pituitary at certain stages in the cycle we have no completely satisfactory proof, but
it is almost certain that such an influence exists. The castration effect must be
regarded as definitely proved.

As to whether the suprarenal and the thyroid exert any effect on the oestrous cycle
in any way other than that they may be supposed to condition it, there is no clear
evidence. The facts have been well presented by SmrrH (1932), who supplies many
references. DEANEsLY (1928) has shown that in the rat and mouse a high percentage
of animals survive after adrenalectomy and that the cycles are normal or slightly
lengthened. Most other recent investigators have got similar results. â€˜The evidence
as to the thyroid is also unsatisfactory. According to Brnorr (1934), however, this
gland plays a part in determining the periodic testicular growth in the drake. The
conclusions are based on the results of injections of thyroid hormone as well as on
the effects of removal of the thyroid.

We may now consider the evidence as to the existence of the exteroceptive or
other stimuli which regulate the gonadotropic activities of the anterior pituitary.
