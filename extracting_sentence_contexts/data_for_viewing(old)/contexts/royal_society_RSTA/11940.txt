Thus the point (m,, mg) lies on the cubic, its polar line is A + pp, + p2P2 = 0, ant
polar conic consists of this line and another. Hence the three solutions of the»
equations coincide, and we have p, = ™,, Py = Mg. ;

Thus the cuspidal edge is enveloped by the inflexional tangents, and is a sol
of the differential equation of the congruency.

If the surface has a nodal curve the equations M = 0, 2M/dz = 0, 0*M/dp? = 0
apparently satisfied along it, but these equations, as they stand, are not enough t
determine c, and ¢, and when ¢, and ¢, are evaluated by means of another differ
tiation they are not generally equal to p, and p, taken along the nodal curve.
fact there are two inflexional tangents in each sheet at every point, and the tang
to the nodal curve is not generally the same as any of the four. Hence the ne
curve, as such, is not a solution.*
