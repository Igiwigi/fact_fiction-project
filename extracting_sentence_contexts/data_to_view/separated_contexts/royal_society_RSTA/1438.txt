tan 6 = 0-74014: 0 = 36°-51: Period = 9-86: 4 = — 0-0063. The values found for the period, 10-06 and 9-86, are close to the values given by the
harmonic curve equation, viz., 10-087 and 9-845. The values found for a, which should
be zero, are, in fact, numerically less than 0-01 in each case. The agreement seems
quite satisfactory. Proceeding now to the work on the sunspot numbers, the following are the results :—
