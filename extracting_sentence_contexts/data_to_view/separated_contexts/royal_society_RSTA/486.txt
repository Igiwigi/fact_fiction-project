view is based seems sufficiently strong, undoubted exceptions occur which, if they are not
enough to invalidate the hypothesis as a whole, indicate that we should regard it as a
general approximation. Additional support for the general thesis has, however, been pro-
vided by the discovery first of all that various derivatives of 4-aminostilbene possess such
inhibitory properties par excellence, and only later that these compounds are in fact endowed
with carcinogenic properties; if no proof can be claimed, the correlation would seem to be
more than one of chance alone. Another biological association which receives considerable support fromâ€™ the present
results is that between carcinogenicity and the property of inducing the formation of
haemolymph nodes in the rat.
