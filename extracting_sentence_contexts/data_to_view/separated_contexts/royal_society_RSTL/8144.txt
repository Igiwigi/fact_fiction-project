Further, whenever the land- and
sea-breeze and also the daily normal are simultaneously almost entirely suspended (which,
however, rarely occurs, and never except during the monsoon months), there will be a
double rotation of the yane in one day, the movement round the compass approaching
more and more nearly to uniformity of progression as the land- and sea-breeze and the
daily normal become less and less. It will be noticed that the daily normals which blow from different directions will all be
differently modified by the superposition upon them of the diurnal variation of the wind:

®* The almost exact coincidence of the direction of the resultant wind for the whole year with that of the
sea-breeze is remarkable ; and the fact scems to point to the 8ame cause for the origination of one as for the
other, viz. the higher temperature (on the average) of the air over the land compared with that of the air over
the sea. Obseryations made on the eastern sea-board of India will «how whether there is any truth in this
conjecture,

throughout the day of ten miles per hour, and that a diurnal variation like that repre-
