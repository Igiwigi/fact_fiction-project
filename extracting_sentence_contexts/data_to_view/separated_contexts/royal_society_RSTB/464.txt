The point can only be made out clearly in a fresh specimen, as in preserved animals
the ends of the tubes are completely clogged with blood corpuscles. The ends of the
tubes, as already mentioned, either project into the blood in the pericardium, or
penetrate the spaces in the fat body: in either case they are bathed in blood. The tubes are clothed with cells which resemble those of the hypodermis, and are,
in fact, a continuation of the latter. Their appearance is shown in figs. 9, 12, 13.
