It is remarkable that as we proceed from benzene to naphthalene and from naphthalene
to anthracene, the numerical increases in diamagnetic susceptibility are confined
practically to one direction, viz., normal to the plane of the benzene rings.*

4. Biphenyl and Dibenzyl.
We next consider biphenyl and dibenzyl, which, in view of the fact that the
X-ray measurements at present available are not sufficiently precise to determine the

* In the previous article, we have assumed the orientations of anthracene molecules given by X-ray
measurements and calculated the K’s. On the other hand, if complete X-ray analysis of the crystal had

not been made, we could still have deduced the K’s either from structural considerations, as for naphthalene,
or preferably from the relation

K,Outle — K Calls — K Cully — Kee, § = 1, 2, 3,

and thence determined solely from magnetic data the correct orientations of molecules in the unit cell.
