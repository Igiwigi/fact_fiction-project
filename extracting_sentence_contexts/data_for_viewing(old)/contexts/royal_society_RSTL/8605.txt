a short distance inwards, is lost. The series of smaller longitudinal muscular bands is
continued all over the ambulacral line, as may be seen by reference to the figure referred
to above. The stout vertical muscles of the line swell out as they pass between these
longitudinal bundles to end at the external transverse or circular muscular layer. Tn
Rhymchodemus the ambulacral line is merely marked by an absence of pigment, and a
Slight increase in strength of the yertical fibres.

In Dendrocelum lacteum, as may be seen from Plate XIV. fig. 7, a well-defined
external circular muscular coat exists, to which are attached the stout bundles of vertical
or dorso-yentral fibres. The dorso-ventral fibres pass between bundles of longitudinal
fibres, just as do the radiating fibres of Bipalium and Rhynchodemus between the super-
ficial longitudinal muscular bundles. The cells of the rod-like bodies lie Jjust beneath
and between the bundles of longitudinal fibres, in fact bear the same relation to them
as in Bipalium and Rhynchodemus. Internally to these well-defined muscular elements,
and between these and the digestive cavity, is an interval filled up with a pulpy tissue,
which is not s0 perfectly differentiated histologically. In this tisxue are embedded the
thread-cells and connective-tissue elements, and in cavities excavated in its 8ubstance the
generative organs and water-vascular system. It evidently corresponds to the internal
muscular mass of Zipalium. On its outer margin can be traced fibres having a circular
arrangement ; but I was unable to detect a second series of definite longitudinal fibres in it.

In Leptoplana tremellaris (Plate XIV. fig. 1) the external circular muscular coat is
reduced to a mere membrane, and this is succeeded by a layer of longitudinal fibres.
In their histological development the elements of the body-mass lying internally to
this are much more perfectly differentiated than in Dendrocelum lacteum. The
