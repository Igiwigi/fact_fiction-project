compositional space where carbonate glass formation occurs.

Determination of the truly anhydrous carbonate glass transition temperature is experimentally
nearly impossible to achieve due to the ubiquitous hygroscopic nature of the KxCO3-MgCO3
near-eutectic composition. Therefore, our experimental and analytical approach strenuously
aimed at minimizing atmospheric moisture absorption during pre- and post-experimental
sample preparation, which ultimately allowed determining the closest possible experimental
approximation of the ‘dry’ glass transition temperature (245°C at 0.02wt% HO, sample
KMG6-2). Furthermore, presumably undetected water contents of previous reported nominally
anhydrous carbonate glasses [21,29,31,32,43-46] can now be reconstructed through equation
(4.1) using the one-parametric GT fit to our obtained Tg—H2O relationship (figure 4). According
to the established T,-H2O relationship, the recently nominally anhydrous T,, peak of 230.5°C
(Tg, fictive = 216.5°C; 490 K) reported by Dingwell et al. [21] for carbonate glasses quenched from

melts of near-eutectic composition (55 mol% K2CO3 — 45 mol% MgCOs3) suggest the presence of : SB
approximately 0.5 wt% HO during their glass synthesis at 0.1 GPa. os

(c) The water content of amorphous carbonates

The water content of amorphous carbonates strongly influences their crystallization. The
distinction between glass and amorphous materials is becoming increasingly blurred (see [33])
when thermal analysis using rapid heating rates is used, and there is a complex relationship
between dehydration reactions, glass transition onset and crystallization. As noted above, the
rare amorphous, copper hydroxycarbonate georgeite is an important catalyst precursor [49].
This material can be synthesized [50] readily, calcined and reduced to form Cu- and, in the
