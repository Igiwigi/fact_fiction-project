C. MALET ON A CLASS OF INVARIANTS. 773
Hence referring to equation (A) we see that

Py Py

2+3P\7Z 2 + 3P,;  LP,y=0

Un

may be expressed in the form

£2 +6072+2(59+107+20,)7+2(40,Q+%2)y=0
therefore

fl
P,=2Q, P,=22+89,Q,

a
3P,=2% +80/*+40,
From these equations eliminating Q,, Q, we get
dL
Tz +2P.L—2P,;=0 or K=0

as the required condition. The relation y,*=y;y, involving only the ratios of the solutions must be also
expressible in terms of the invariants of the firsb kind considered in this paper, and in
fact we find

aL aH
7, +2Þ,L—2P,=37-—20
where H and G have the same meaning as before. To arrive directly ab this condition in terms of FH and G, we see on referring to (B)
that the cubic with the second term removed by the substibution for y of ye-ſ Vi.

49 +-3H% — +Gy=0
can be written in the form
SER 4H, SIDES 29y=0
where
1
H=Q,-Q2—
Therefore

3H=4H,, G=27D
and eliminating FH, we find
an
85,-—2G=0

the required result.
