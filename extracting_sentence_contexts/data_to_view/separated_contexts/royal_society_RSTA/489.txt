The
position of the basic substituent would seem of paramount importance; thus 2-dimethyl-
aminostilbene is much less active than the 4-isomeride, and the 3-compound is inactive. A further essential feature is the ethylene bridge; activity disappears when either of its
hydrogen atoms is substituted, when the bridge is reduced with formation of a diphenyl-
ethane derivative, when it is extended to contain three or four carbon atoms as in the
isomeric propylenes or the corresponding butadiene, or when either methine group is
replaced by a nitrogen atom. Compounds in which the ethylene bridge is absent (diphenyl
and phenylnaphthalene derivatives), or is replaced by oxygen or sulphur, have proved
inactive, and activity is also dependent upon the ¢rans configuration of the molecule about
the ethylenic bond, and to a large extent on a free 4-position in ring B.

These and other facts (e.g. that increase in size of substituents in position 2’ leads to
diminution of activity) have suggested the working hypothesis that one of the features
required for biological effectiveness is an unbroken conjugation of the amino group with
both nuclei; according to the modern concepts of resonance dipolar quinonoid structures

such as (VIII) are indeed canonical structures contributing to the aminostilbene molecule
(see below). The contribution of VIII depends, among other things, on the coplanar
arrangement of the two benzene nuclei which characterizes the trans form of the stilbenes; in
the cis stereoisomerides the two rings are not coplanar, and the resonance energy is greatly
reduced. That the presence of a second para substituent (in position 4’) may entail complete loss
of activity, to some extent independent of the nature of the substituent group, is one of the
