Several established mar-

of transplantable SSCs (Nakagawa et al. 2007). The spermatogonia are listed in figure 3. Here we define
fact that Ngn3 was not expressed by all transplantable progenitors as undifferentiated spermatogonia that
stem cells in that study provides additional evidence are committed to differentiate. An example of this
that there may be heterogeneity among SSCs. A con- approach is shown in figure 4 for the putative SSC
ditional knock-in approach was also used to marker, Spalt-like 4 (SALL4).
