This is hardly to be explained as
being due to the greater dimensions of the bundle below than above. It may
perhaps be correlated with the fact that the upper part of the seed undergoes a
relatively late extension. The only ground for this suggestion is the fact that the
plinth is wanting in the small abortive seeds (phot. 2), so that in passing from the
small to the full grown dimensions there must have been considerable intercalation in
that particular zone of the seed. The Abortive Seeds.
