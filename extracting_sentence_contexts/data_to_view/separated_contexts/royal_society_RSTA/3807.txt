In fact, this is the celebrated Hopf fibration [24],
by which the 3-sphere is fibred by 1-spheres (circles) with base space the 2-sphere; the Stokes
parameters (2.4) define a standard form for the Hopf map [25]. In this 3-sphere, a contour of
constant S (or Sp or $3) defines a 2-torus: fixing the value of all three (respecting $4 = S} + $3 +
$3) defines a single orbit along which three tori intersect. The rich structure of this Hamiltonian
system comes from the fact that it is superintegrable [26], with more independent constants of the
motion (three) than there are classical degrees of freedom (two, the dimension of configuration
space); there are even more symmetries in the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator [22,27]. A feature of integrable systems is that they admit a reparametrization, by a suitable canonical : =
transformation, to action-angle variable (whose generalized position coordinate is an angle 38
x, and generalized momentum I a constant of the motion). In the two-dimensional isotropic :
harmonic oscillator, one set of action—angle coordinates is xy =t (0<t<2m), and 1=H= 150. nee)
Another pair of action—angle variables defines the particular elliptical orbit: the conjugate angular :
variable to angular momentum L is a, the angle between the x-axis and the major axis of the ellipse
