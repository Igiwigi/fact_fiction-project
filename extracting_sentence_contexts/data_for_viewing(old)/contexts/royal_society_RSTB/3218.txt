The other kind of opening is not lined by any such syncytial layer, and opens into
channels which are apt to run parallel with the columnar epithelium. These I take
to be the openings for the venous stream. â€˜Text-fig. 11 (I.V.).

Tt is, of course, impossible to speak with certainty, but the fact that the lining
layer alluded to in connection with the presumably arterial channels is in direct
continuity with the walls of the channels in the stroma, and nearly always shows a
very sharp boundary line between itself and the trophoblast, points to its being ot
maternal origin, and probably an ingrowth of cells along the channels of the arterial
stream,

These facts I have shown diagrammatically in text-fig. 11, page 185.

This arrangement of blood supply is very usual in placentas, by means of which
the maternal arterial blood is taken at once to the foetal side of the placenta.
Cf. Mouse (Jenkinson); Rabbit (Duva). That there should be apparently so slight
a connection, if any, between trophoblast and somatopleur is, I believe, unusual.

So great a development of the trophoblast maternal circulation with so complete an
absence of fetal villi and of foetal mesoblastic tissue in connection therewith is more
akin to the condition in the Rodents (though in them the area of the greatly
thickened trophoblast is restricted to a cap), and in Erinaceus and man which it
resembles in being formed over the whole surface, though in them there is an early
penetration of the allantois. In the human ovum (Peters (78)), there is at a much
