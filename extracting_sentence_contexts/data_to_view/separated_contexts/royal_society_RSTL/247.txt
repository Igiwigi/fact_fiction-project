&1 These most commonly are met. with when the- limb is taken
E off above the knee, and the nerves and-vessels have; been pre-
S viously inflamed higher than the part | at which they were
E divided; and where the nerve is confined by the thickened
SI state of the surrounding parts. 5 The same fact also explains the cause of locked jaw, when
= it is produced by a wound or bruise upon a nerve, in a con-
= stitution either rendered irritable by climate, or naturally $0;
'Z also where the nerve itself becomes diseased, in consequence of
2 the accident. EZ The following case of locked jaw, from an injury to the
Z thumb, bears $0 great a resemblance to the case related in the
s beginning of this paper, as to show that the diseases must be
bt nearly allied. 3 A lady of a very irritable habit was overturned in her car-
Z riage, and hurt her thumb, which swelled very much; and the
E skin over the metacarpal bone of the fore-finger, about the size

of a shilling, sloughed off, No symptoms came on for four-
teen days after the accident, when, upon bending her fingers,
violent spasms took place in the thumb, which proceeded up to
the neck and lower jaw; these were exceedingly painful, and
the jaw was 80 much shut as hardly to admit a tea-spoon.
