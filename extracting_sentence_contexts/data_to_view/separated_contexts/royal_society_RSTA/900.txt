8—AHistory of the Problem

It is a well-known fact that long beams can be bent by terminal couples without
producing any anti-clastic curvature in them. In all such cases the displacements
are not in any way small, and the curvature produced by the applied couples is
considerable. Hence it is that the stress-distribution varies from that indicated by
Bernoutu-Evter theory.
