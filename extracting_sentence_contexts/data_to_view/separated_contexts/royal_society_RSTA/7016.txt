The effect of mixture strength on peroxide production was examined (a) at a constant
compression ratio well below the knock limit, and (6) with the compression ratio raised in
each case to a figure giving heavy knock. Under non-knocking conditions the peak peroxide
concentration was found to occur at a mixture strength between 5 and 10% richer than
chemically correct, i.e. approximately at the maximum knock mixture strength (figure 15). In fact, the curve of peroxide concentration against mixture strength was a close reflexion
of the curve of h.u.c.r. against mixture strength. When the compression ratio was raised to
the knock limit at each mixture strength on the other hand, it was found that the peak
peroxide concentration was sensibly constant over the mixture range (the curve shown is
the average of a large number of determinations). The slight drop in concentration with
increasing mixture strength may be due to after-effects on the peroxides while they are in
transit from the valve to the trap; such effects might be caused by the increased proportion
of fuel residues at richer mixtures.
