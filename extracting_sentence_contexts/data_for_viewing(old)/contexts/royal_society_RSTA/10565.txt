carbon is cored than when both are solid, and most positive of all when both
are cored, all other things being equal.

(2) The frequency of the alternating current that makes 6V/8A begin to have
a positive value is lower when either carbon is cored than when both are
solid, and lowest when both are cored.

(3) The value of 8V/8A, with a given root mean square value of the superimposed
alternating current, depends not only on the nature of the carbons and on
the frequency of that current, but also on the magnitude of the direct
current, and on the length of the are.

* Neer observed the fact that the P.D. fell to a minimum and then rose again, in 1886, but as he used
cored positive carbons only, he did not discover that this form of curve was peculiar to those carbons.

{ Icall 8V/3A more positive in one case than in another when it has either a larger positive value, or
a smaller negative value in the first case than in the second.


MRS. H. AYRTON ON THE MECHANISM OF THE ELECTRIC ARC. 321

There are two ways in which the P.D, between the carbons, for a given current
and length of are, may be lowered by the core; (1) by an increase in the cross-
