& seek the biological meaning of nocturnal closure under these headings.t
% We have seen that the closure of the stomata is associated with dry air or with
diminished water supply, and it is not, therefore, clear why the stomata should be
losed at night when the air is damp and cool, and there is absolutely no risk of
Bxcessive transpiration.
é Brackmant has pointed out that the passage of CO, into the leaf is a more difficult
process than the entrance of oxygen, because the difference of tension on which it
Spends isso small. It follows from this that the absorption of CO,, which is the
“first stage in the process of assimilation is physically at a disadvantage in comparison
“vith respiration. It may well be that assimilation requires a wider stomatal
aperture than is necessary for respiration. And since economy in the use of water
s in most cases desirable, the partial closure at night would effect this economy at
Ahe most advantageous time. The fact that aquatic plants with a constant water
supply and an extremely moist atmosphere have open stomata at night may be
adduced to support this view. The theory has much in its favour, but it does not
exhaust the subject.

+ Lerrcep (86), p. 183, is of opinion that no special biological meaning can be given to the nocturnal
closure. He considers the stomata chiefly important only as regulators of transpiration, and thus looks
on their closure as superfluous in the moist air of night, or even hurtful as checking respiration—for he
clearly recognizes the aerating function of the stomata.
