This fifth dimension is a
probability space as well as a metric space. This extra SV 1X, OFX | DFO),
dimension is an embedded degree of freedom and is where Y is the (set of) observed data; 0 is a set of model
random in nature. In fact, the dynamic geometry parameters; and X is an unobserved (latent) stationary
framework makes it possible to distinguish one individual stochastic process. This stochastic process is induced by
from another. The uniqueness of individuals must the first-order transition model
operate in detail not in principle, i.e. general solutions = f(X( + 1) | X(0), 0),
must operate on the basis of a generalized solution field.
