It has been imagined that the presence of the
mies of hydrogen lines iri the ultra-violet was of itself sufficient evidence of a very high temperature.

experiments of Cornu! however, have shown that the complete series of lines can be seen with an
dinary spark without jar. Hence, the high temperature of such a star as Sirius is not indicated by

fact that its spectrum shows the whole series of hydrogen lines, but by the fact that there is bright
ntinuous radiation far in the ultra-violet.

The stars with flutings in their spectra are probably among the coolest, as we kno
from laboratory experiments that flutings are always associated with low temperatu
Assuming these distinctions to be true, it is seen that when the two series of ascendi
and descending spectra are united in this way, the hottest stars, as we should expe
fall in the middle of the combined series. iv
