4, vertebra
still farther forward, cloacal region. a, hyaline cartilage (outer-zone cartilage); 4, fibrous tissue, the greatly elongated intervertebral
ligament ; ¢, fibrous septum, a product of the inner-zone cartilage—it is traversed in the middle
by the remains of the notochord; d, a two-layered circular plate, with fibro-cartilage between the
two layers of the plate; it represents the double cone, antero-posteriorly compressed ; ¢, calcified
ring, the last remnant of the double cone (see also fig. 5, B, e); f, watery jelly, the remains of the
notochord,

The arch-cartilages have calcified tesserse, and the fact that these are better
developed in the caudal than in the trunk region is a further argument in support of
the view that the trunk vertebre are in a degraded, and not in a primitive condition. At the sides of the caudal vertebree, on a horizontal level with the middle of the
centrum, are calcified tracts that lie just external to the membrana elastica externa
(fig. 5, A, p’).
