showing that, for a given kinetic anisotropy, ag, the dendrite tip radius takes a constant value for
each arbitrarily chosen dendrite tip velocity. Thus, both criteria (3.22) and (3.23) confirm a key role
of kinetics (when compared with the surface energy anisotropy) for high-rate dendritic growth
highlighted in [59,60].

(d) Solvability criteria for solutal and thermo-solutal growth

Consider now a chemical dendrite in a binary mixture growing in the presence of convection
under constant temperature. The problem statement and solvability analysis are quite similar
to the aforementioned purely thermal theory. The difference consists in the fact that the chemical
dendrite is described by the so-called one-sided model (diffusion in the liquid controls the growth
and diffusion in the solid is negligible). This gives a scale factor ‘2’ in the solvability criterion.
In addition, keeping in mind a correlation multiplier mC;(1 — ko)/Tg appearing as a result of
transition from the purely thermal to the purely chemical Stefan problem, we come to the stability
criterion oé, that describes a stable dendritic growth in two-component isothermal systems with


a forced convective flow:
