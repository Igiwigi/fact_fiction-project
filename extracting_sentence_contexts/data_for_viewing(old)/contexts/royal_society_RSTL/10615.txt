SEperiod, as above stated. Tt is obvious that, with an excess of manure on the manured
Splot, the exhaustion by the removal of the second crops will be much less on it than on
Sthe unmanured plot ; and hence the amount of the produce calculated as increase over
=bhat withoub manure will be the greater. There was also a considerably increased
Lyield of both mineral matter and nitrogen over the later as compared with the
gearlier years, due to the removal of second crops. Still, there was, over the whole
Zperiod, scarcely more than half of the supplied nitrogen estimated to be recovered ;
Zand even over the last six years, in five of which 'scond crops were removed, there
was, s0 far as can be estimated, only about bwo-thirds of the annually supplied nitrogen
nnually recovered. In fact, when, as is now done, the results of five more years, in
-2four of which second crops were removed, are brought into the calculation, the general
Zeonclusions as stated in Part I., where the points under discussion, and the explana-
Stion of the facts, are more fully considered than would be appropriate here, are not
Sinvalidated.
8, Finally, as will be judged from the results of the separations which have been
<=considered, the general aspect of this plot was nob widely different from that of the
Sunmanured plots ; but it exhibited a greater preponderance of grasses, and some
â€”Zincreased depth of colour, and luxuriance. The appearance of the herbage was,

Bnevertheless, upon the whole, that of restricted growth.

a We now turn from the consideration of the effects, on the botany of the plots, of
more or less complex artificial mixtures of the various constituents of manure, to thoss
