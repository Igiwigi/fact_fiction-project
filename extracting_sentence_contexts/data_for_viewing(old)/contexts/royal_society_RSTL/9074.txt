7 calico bags, and boiled for intervals varying from half a minute to five minutes. They
S were then carefully sown in flower-pots filled with well-prepared earth, and placed in a
Z shed kept at a temperature of 70* Fahr. An unboiled sample of every seed was sown at
= the same time beside the boiled ones. The unboiled seeds sprouted vigorous)y. Thirty
Z 8econds' exposure to the boiling temperature deprived both the peas and the beans of
bi their power of germination. A few of the cress-seeds exposed for this interval sprouted,
S but the majority were killed, and all were killed by a minute's boiling. On the other
V hand, a very large proportion of the mustard-seeds boiled for thirty seconds germinated.
i= The time of exposure in the case of this seed was doubled, trebled, and quadrupled,
z leaving till a residue of life. The fertile mustard-seeds gradually diminished in number
= as the time of boiling increased, but even after two minutes' boiling many of them
= germinated.
E And now comes a fact which I deem of some importance as regards the present inquiry.
£ When the calico bag was abandoned, and the mustard-seeds were placed loosely in
£ water, 80 as to ensure not only the free communication to them of its temperature, but
| 5 free diffusion between the s0luble portions of the seeds and the surrounding liquid, not
A one of them escaped the ordeal of thirty seconds' boiling. In the first series of experi-
ments, the bag which held the seeds together not only exercised a protecting influence
1 itself, but it enabled the outside seeds to act as shields to the inside ones. Assuredly

| in a far higher degree will cheese $hield germs contained within it. Unlike fruit and
; meat it is highly impervious to water. It thus wards off the liquid on which the softening
and swelling of the germ depend, 80 that within 8uch a substance the life of a germ might
: be indefinitely prolonged.
