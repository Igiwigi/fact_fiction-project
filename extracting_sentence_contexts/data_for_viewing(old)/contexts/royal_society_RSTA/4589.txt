Stewart had claimed that his report had been vetted and approved by the Engineering :&

Department at Ontario Hydro Electric Power, but proponents of municipal power were sceptical
and reached out to the Ontario Hydroelectric Power Commission for confirmation [33, pp. 72,73].
They found that the Ontario engineers had checked the data, but they had also alerted Stewart
to various discrepancies that were not corrected in the final report. ‘Not only are the figures
published in Stewart's report incorrect in many instances, but statements throughout the report
are not in accordance with the facts’, the chairman of Hydro-Ontario stated [33, pp. 74,75].

Nevertheless, Stewart’s report was widely cited in newspaper articles and editorials around
the country, and repeatedly cited by NELA members as proof that public electricity was not
as cheap as its proponents claimed. NELA committees (and their third-party allies) across the
country sent out bulletins, letters and editorials promoting its results. In December 1927, the
Boston Herald published a full-page article, with an eight-column headline, based on Stewart's
work entitled ‘Here is the Truth about Ontario Hydro-Electric’. Power officials were jubilant,
writing ‘we shall make good use of this’ [33, p. 198].

Nor was Stewart's the only such study. A professor at the University of Colorado was paid
$1692—close to a full year’s academic salary—for a survey of costs at municipally owned power
plants in Colorado, which, not surprisingly, offered conclusions that were unfavourable to the
