THE PRINCIPAL CONSTITUENT OF THE TIDES OF THE NORTH SEA. 191

have an amphidromic point of the narrow sea type (figs. 9 and 10). This point
remains in the presence of the tides of fig. 8, being displaced a little towards the
Dutch coast.

Fig. 9. Fig. 10.
H, L denote high and low water respectively.

From fig. 9 we see that to the north of the Flemish Bight we shall have y = 180°,
and if we superpose this on the tides of fig. 8 we shall obtain a value of y lying between
180° and 270°. As a matter of fact, owing to the stronger currents across the southern
section, the value of y in the mouth of the Flemish Bight is only a little greater than 180°,
and the superposition gives the set of co-tidal lines of fig. 11. This is a very good
approximation to that given in fig. 17.

Fig. 11—Co-tidal lines. The numbers give, in degrees, the values of Y ; for comparison with
figs. 1, 2, 3, Y should be divided by 30.

The chief part of the precise current-information obtained from observation is
shown in fig. 12, and it is interesting to compare the currents at the individual stations
