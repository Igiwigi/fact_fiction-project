other species (This has also been observed by Grave, 1921.)

N.B.—These characters are independent of environmental changes in temperature, salinity, light, depth,
periodical exposure, etc. (See BerrIL1, 1928, p. 173.)

the ampulle themselves are fixatory only in so far as they push the test out into
processes which can adhere to surrounding objects and possibly enter crevices. Ciona
intestinalis affords a good example of this (fig. 15, B.), for frequently a bubble of gas is
secreted at the tip of the ampulla, which causes the metamorphosing larva to float
towards the surface of the water (hence the common habitat of Ciona under ships and
buoys), and the organism becomes attached to the surface film by the test near the
distal end of the ampulla. Observations on such forms show at once that the test,
even at this stage of development, can extend along surfaces, while the fact that test
processes of adult Phallusia mammillata and Ascidiella aspersa have been found extending
many inches into crevices in which the animal itself could have existed at no stage of
its development, and the fact that re-attachment can occur after separation shows
that it persists as an active structure throughout life.

Many observers have noted that waves of contraction occur in the ampulle, especially
where these are long, as in Molgula manhattensis. Such waves occur in almost all
ampulla that are reasonably elongated and the maximum rate of wave propagation
seems to be much the same in them all. The contraction commences at the base of
the ampulla and passes slowly as a wave of constriction towards the distal end, causing
marked movement of the enclosed fluid and corpuscles in and out’ of the developing
body cavity. ‘The maximum rate of propagation seems to be about 30 per hour, while
