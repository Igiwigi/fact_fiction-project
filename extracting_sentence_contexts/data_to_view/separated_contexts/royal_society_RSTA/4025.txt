Examples of polydisperse doublets arrested by different solids levels for different values of the radius ratio, NV. The height of each individual image is 250 jum.

range of solids levels and dimensions, all of which form stable, axisymmeteric shapes that are
not significantly distorted by the arrest process. The broad range of shapes possible is evident,
indicating not only the potential for simple synthesis of anistotropic colloids by such a process,
but also the fact that such structures will form a rich array of connections within more complex
emulsion microstructures. The shapes of the doublets show smooth, continuous borders that
indicate the fluid-like behaviour of the droplet surfaces. Although almost solid-like in their static
appearance because of the stabilization of shape by internal elasticity, the structures retain their
fluid interface.
