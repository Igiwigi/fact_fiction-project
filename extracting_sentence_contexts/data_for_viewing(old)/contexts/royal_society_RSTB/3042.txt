ON THE COLOUR-PHYSIOLOGY OF HIGHER CRUSTACEA. 299

h of the spectrum, but in other respects they differ widely from each other. The red
earotin readily unites with alkalies and alkaline earths, gives only a single absorption
band (about the F line), and probably contains oxygen in its molecular constitution.
The yellow carotin does not unite with alkalies, gives the F band and also one
between F and G, and according to the valuable researches of Kou (1902), is an
unsaturated hydrocarbon C,,H3s. The red and yellow colouring matters of higher
Crustacea are probably identical with these carotins, but the constitutions of the blue,
violet and brown pigments are still unknown. With respect to the functions of
these pigments, we have the respiratory hypothesis of Many (1881) and the de-
hydration hypothesis of Her (1892), but the ascertained facts of the chemistry and
physiology of Crustacean pigments are as yet too slender a basis for profitable
speculation on their functions.

In the present paper we endeavour to make a survey of several of the problems
which the morphology and physiology of Crustacean pigments and chromatophores
present. We bring forward a number of new facts and offer suggestions as to their
significance, but we feel that the time has not yet come when we can profitably
enter upon an exhaustive discussion of all the known phenomena of Crustacean
colour-physiology. We hope, however, after a further spell of experimental and
histological work to be in a position to undertake this task.

As far as we can gather, current opinions holds that the pigment of Crustacea are
