fore, why it is that even in the perfectly healthy individual the heart only for a short
time can cope with the greatly increased work thrown upon it by active muscular
exertion, and why it is that very soon, even with maximum action of the augmentors,
the heart becomes fatigued and, therefore, dilated, and that in most cases this
~ fatigue of the heart limits the degree and endurance of muscular exertion. The heart
Scan, as we know, by judicious training be greatly strengthened, so that its force of
‘peontraction effectively counterbalances for a longer period the increase in work which
Bis thrown upon it during exertion, and there is some evidence that this increase in the
power of the heart is, in part, due to hypertrophy of the ventricles (as strictly physio-
“logical as is that hypertrophy of the muscles of an athlete, and as is the “ blacksmith’s
an,” which resembles cardiac hypertrophy in so far that, in both cases, the affected
muscles are more liable to undergo regressive metamorphosis than are unhypertrophied
muscles). That training is mainly a matter of the heart is shown by the fact that
= those articles of diet, or luxuries, such as tea, alcohol, tobacco, and excessive consump-
4 tion of fluids, which are strictly limited in training, all either primarily weaken the
"3 heart or increase the work thrown upon it without corresponding improvement of its
BE nutrition. Alcohol, as we will show elsewhere, causes primary weakening of the
3 ventricular contractions, and, if given in large enough dose, induces dilation, which,
‘S in itself, without any increase in the work, may lead to functional incompetence of the
© auriculo-ventricular valves. How small a quantity of alcohol will suffice to prevent
& prolonged or severe exertion is well known, for example, to such Alpine climbers as

S along day. We do not believe that Alpine climbers ever repeat this experiment.
-g Nicotine also acts on the heart like alcohol, causing primary weakness and dilation of
3 the ventricles, and the same is the case with caffein, although the latter is not so
