An interesting finding in the UV colour vision study was
that the species H. trispinosa showed a strong aversive
response to UVB light (314 nm) and was reluctant to make
a choice when it was present. This indicates that certain col-
ours can carry intrinsic information, in this case aversive, if
used as visual signals. The behaviour is likely the responsibil-
ity of a single receptor, since only one UV receptor class is
specifically devoted to UVB light ([36]; figure 2a). Such a
built-in response is more akin to a wavelength-specific behav-
iour than to true colour vision. So far, wavelength-specific
signals in the human-visible spectral range have not been
documented. In fact, work by Amanda Franklin et al.
