74 and 78) and anticipated
by Crayton Brant (‘ Nature,’ vol. 49, p. 457 ; ‘ Chem. News.,’ vol. 71, p. 1, and vol. 73,
p. 180). This method is based on the fact that very dry cotton-wool exposed to damp air
absorbs moisture and warms as a consequence. The temperature rises rapidly at first, reaches a maximum, and then tails slowly off
until, if the temperature of the surroundings is constant, it approaches its original
value. Using about 1 gramme of wool tied round the bulb of a thermometer, Masson
found that the maximum temperature was reached about half an hour after exposure
to the moist air, but the approach of the temperature to its old value lasted many hours.
