I have
secured young plants of this species from three different sources, and in each lot
found the same results. Iam disposed to believe that the specimens examined by
Lecierc pu SaBron could not have been quite normal. This belief is strengthened
by the fact that young plants of P. vulgare gave similar negative results. In my
specimens of P. awreum and P. vulgare, when the tube of xylem is first established,
it has phloem on its internal surface as well as on the outside. A core of funda-
mental tissue is likewise enclosed almost immediately.
