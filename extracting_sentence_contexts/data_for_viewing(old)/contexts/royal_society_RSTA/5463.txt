Together with the fact that there can be relative motion between the source
and the lens, there is still the likelihood of observing an effect. Microlensing
a term introduced by Paczynski—generally refers to the case where either the
source alone or both the source and the lens are unresolved. Consequently, the
deflection and distortion of light from the background source cannot be seen.
The key signature is a temporal brightening of the combined signal from the
source plus lens as the one passes in front of the other. The time scale of the
brightening can be anything from seconds to years, and the observed light curve
gives information on the lens mass, the relative distances and the motion of the
lensing object (assuming the background object is stationary). As microlensing
is a transient phenomenon, an effective survey strategy is to monitor a dense
star field repeatedly, searching for that rare occasion when an individual star
increases its brightness. Of course, complicating such searches is the fact that
many stars are genuinely variable in their output. Once a likely event has been
triggered, it can be monitored more intensively to see if the light curve is of the
form expected for microlensing. For a survey monitoring the dense star field in
the centre of the Milky Way, the optical depth is about 2 x 10~® (or an event at
a particular time for every 400000 stars being studied). In many cases, the light
curves can be monitored to such exquisite precision that second-order effects, such
as the motion of the Earth around the Sun, the finite size of the star that acts
as a lens and even planets surrounding the lensing star, can be detected. With
interferometric telescopes, shifts in the positions of the source may ultimately be
detected.

Microlensing has had a major impact on astronomy in two areas, both involving
