of a film, it mus be 8mall, it appeared to us that the question as to whether it existed
could only be settled beyond the possibility of dispute by experiment, We have,
therefore, assumed in this paper that such a difference is possible. We have also
8upposed that the relation between the difference of snrface tension and the other
properties of the film is snch that the only considerable movement to which it gives
rise is a change of curvature. Having by experiments, conducted on these favourable

probable constitution of the film in view of the facts which experiment has elicited. ]
| In studying the properties of the black portion of a s0ap film, it is also important
to remember that it has a well-defined boundary which indicates an apparent discon-
tinuity in the thickness. It may be urged that if the thickness is less than that of
two 8urface layers there must also be an apparent discontinuity in the 8urface tension_
| at the edge of the black. If this were 80, a free globular bubble, consisting of two
| - parts, a, coloured portion and a black © polar cap,” could not be spherical, but must
| consist of two 8pherical segments which meet at a finite angle. This condition is not
consistent with equilibrium, and therefore the black and coloured portions of the film
must have the same tension. |
We think this argument deserves consideration, but we have not thought tha ib is
80 conclusive as to obviate the necessity of experiment to determine the facts. Tn
