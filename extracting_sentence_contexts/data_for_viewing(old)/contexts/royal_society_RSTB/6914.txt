and in crossing it produced a figure of ‘8’ path, illustrated on the right of figure 5.
This was true also of Musca domestica, as is shown in the upper part of figure 6. There
was at the same time a backward displacement of the upward path. The magnitude
of this fore and aft displacement of the wing path relative to the insect for eight
individuals is represented in the lower part of figure 5, as explained in the legend to
that figure. No change was observed at any time, however, in the inclination of the
general plane of movement of the wings, comparable with that described by Stellwaag
(1916) in the bee, Apis mellifica. Quite apart from any changes in the position of the
centre of pressure relative to the wings—such as Demoll (1918) has suggested may
play a part in giving stability in insect flight—or changes in the magnitude of the
forces acting in different parts of the beat, this modification in the path travelled by
the wing relative to the body would be expected to produce a considerable displace-
ment of the resultant force, such as has been shown in fact to occur when the insect
is exposed to a stream of air.

The path travelled by the wings under any set of conditions will be that in which
there is equilibrium between the aerodynamic forces acting on the wing surface, and
those forces, imposed upon the wing at its base, which result from the nature of the
wing articulation and the applied forces of muscular origin. A change in path may
be initiated by modifications in either of these. We must consider next whether the
observed changes in path result primarily from the former, the aerodynamic side of
the equilibrium, or from the latter, the physiological side.

Two types of change in wing movements with alteration of airspeed and inclination
have been noted already and described respectively in terms of (a) the amplitude in
