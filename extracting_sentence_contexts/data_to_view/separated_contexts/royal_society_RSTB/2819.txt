Protopteridophyta. The view that the strobiloid type is the fundamental one harmonises with the
anatomical facts. The non-medullated protostele is generally accepted by anatomists
as the primitive arrangement in the axis; it is found still among the Lycopods,
persistent in the mature individual. But even large-leaved Ferns of most complex
mature structure, such as the Marattiacese, show a single solid protostele in the
young plant.* The same is the case generally in the young state of Leptosporangiate
Ferns, and even in the mature condition of some of them.
