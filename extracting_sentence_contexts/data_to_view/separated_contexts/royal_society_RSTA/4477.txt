This lack of direct [4
experience increases the likelihood that people will be following a small but determined minority DN
of (mis-)information brokers, in particular, if their messages are culturally consonant with oneâ€™s [sz
belief system. :&

This process is already visibly occurring with climate change, which has become a highly ,
contested issue (at least in some countries [28-30]) in which misinformation abounds and
polarization based on political orientation is rampant [31-34]. We should therefore not take for
granted that our advanced and complex civilizations will respond to global challenges in the
most appropriate manner. In fact, it is the very complexity of our technological civilizations that
should concern us because of the potential for surprises it entails, as Parker & Risbey [35] show
in their article on the role of surprises in uncertainty assessments. Parker & Risbey nominate
two criteria that scientific assessments should fulfil when reporting the uncertainty associated
with projections: they must be faithful and they must be complete. The latter requirement turns
out to be rather more involved than might first meet the eye.
