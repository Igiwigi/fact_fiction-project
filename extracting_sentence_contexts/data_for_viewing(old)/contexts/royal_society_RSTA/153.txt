o lower individual risk factors and treat evident coronary artery stenoses have
reduced the cardiovascular event rate by 20-30%. Therefore, developing improved
modalities for the diagnosis and the treatment of coronary disease is important for
oth an increased quality of life and a reduction of the cost associated with CAD
across the EU which, for example, amounted to almost 1% of to 1999 gross domestic
product and to almost 11% of total national health expenditure in the UK.

Options for the treatment of CAD range from medication to transcutaneous

options provide successful therapeutic strategies for CAD, it is important to
improve our insights into all factors involved in myocardial perfusion, to which
