Four of them
remained perfectly intact, while two of them became promptly charged with organisms.
Â© PasTEUR infers from these observations the non-continuity of the cause to which s0-called
spontaneous generation is due. This inference is quite in accord with the notion of
Bacterial clouds snggested by my observations. PASTEUR, in fact, sometimes opened
his flask in the midst of a Bacterial cloud and obtained life, sometimes in the interspace
between two clouds, and obtained no life. Not with a view of repeating this observation, which had been forgotten, but for another
reason, I opened on the 6th of January last a number of hermetically sealed tubes in
one and the same room of the Royal Institution. The names of the infusions contained
in the tubes, the date of sealing them up, their condition before opening on the 6th,
and their appearance six days subsequently on the 12th are given in the accompanying
statement.
