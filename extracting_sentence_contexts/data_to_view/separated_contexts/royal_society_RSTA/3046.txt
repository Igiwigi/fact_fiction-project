It is worth noting how remarkable it is that we can know that the distance is 410 Mpc, even with [=
30% uncertainty, for an event that has no observed electromagnetic counterpart. This is because : S
such an event is a standard siren, whose gravitational waveform contains enough information 2
about its intrinsic luminosity to enable us to infer distance from its measured apparent brightness aed
[16]. The relatively large uncertainty in our distance measurement comes from the fact that we : _
observed this event with only two detectors and cannot therefore place it accurately on the sky, [4
nor accurately measure its polarization, both of which we need to compare accurately its apparent : *
brightness with the intrinsic luminosity read from the waveform. Observations with a network : =
of at least three detectors are required for an accurate distance measurement, and that became : RS

possible when Advanced Virgo joined the network on 1 August 2017. We will discuss that further
in the next section.
