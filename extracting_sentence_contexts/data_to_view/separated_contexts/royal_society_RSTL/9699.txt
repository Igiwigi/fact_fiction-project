It was strikingly 80 in the case of
the produce of plot 14. Thus, besides the much greater accumulation of soda which
was 80 liberally applied, the plants growing under the influence of the nitrate accumu-
lated not only more of each of the other mineral constituents (except potass) which
were equally supplied to both plots, but more also of silica which was not supplied to
either. This obviously indicates possession by the roots of the growing herbage of a
greater range of soil and 8ubsoil, and is consistent with the facts which have been
pointed ont as to the character of the roob development, and the altered condition of
the subsoil, under the influence of the nitrate of soda. Since the produce grown by the mineral manures and nitrate was riper when ent;
than that by the mineral manures and ammonia-salts, a s0mewhat lower percentage in
the dry substance, of potass, as well as of other constituents, would be expected ; and
ib might merely indicate a greater accumulation of organic matter at the maturing
period, by which, obviously, the percentage in the dry snbstance of the already
accumulated mineral matter would be reduced. Such reduction is known to be the
general accompaniment of fayourable maturation.
