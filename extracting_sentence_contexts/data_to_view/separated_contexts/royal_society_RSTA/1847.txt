One interesting outcome of these calculations relates to the relative importance of
the terms in E7é,‘ and At’. The ratio E¢,?/A is small in every case taken (of course
these exclude the neighbourhood of points where A = 0, where naturally E becomes
of great importance), But for the set of magnifications taken, the greatest ratio of
the second term to the first is less than 0°03 and the mean value of this ratio is only
0°0082, so that, in fact, the E term—although so complicated algebraically—does not
exercise any great influence numerically. This is important, as it shows that, at any rate for lenses, it does not require to be
computed with anything like the same order of accuracy which is needed for A and B.
