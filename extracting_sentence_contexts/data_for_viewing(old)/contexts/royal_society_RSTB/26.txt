MINUTE ANALYSIS OF CORTICAL CENTRES. 165

As is shown in this Table, the sequence in the movement of the joints is funda-
mentally similar to that which had been arrived at from clinical observation by Dr.
Hueuines JAcKson in cases of epilepsy, in which he had recorded the “ march” of
the movements of the joints.

As all the facts which we have accumulated on the subject of the primary repre-
sentation of movement of joints and the representation of secondary, &c., movements
are collated in a very demonstrative manner in the accompanying figs. 7 and 8, a
detailed description is hardly called for, but we cannot leave this pathologically very
important subject without dwelling for a moment on some of the more salient features
of our results.

We have already pointed out on page 163 why the shoulder, wrist, and thumb are
the joints, par excellence, in which primary movement takes place.

We will now, therefore, discuss the march, 7.e., the order in which the movements of
the various joints follow each other after the primary movement. The first and most
fundamental fact concerning the successive invasion of the various joints has already
