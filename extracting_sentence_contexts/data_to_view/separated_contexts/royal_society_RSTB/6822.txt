The margins of the facets are limited
by a mere bend in the cuticle, and their lower margins trespass on the top of the gynoecium
and include some of the uppermost scales.

(b) Bracts

Five flowers show attached bracts clearly; various naked axes show bract scars and there
are many isolated bracts forming a varied series. Thomas described some of these isolated
bracts but concluded that they were vegetative bud scales and that the flower was normally
naked. It is likely enough that some of them are in fact vegetative, but the vegetative buds
of this plant are as yet unknown. The attached bracts are all members of the inner perianth, the outer ones being attri-
buted to it on circumstantial evidence. These attached ones are about 15 mm. long,
1-5-2:0 mm. wide near the base and taper to a point.
