They fitted the data with a Weibullâ€™s distribution, suggesting a weakest-link mechanism,
plausible for tensile fracturing [22], and linked this variability of the mechanical strength to
that of the microstructure. However, to ascertain the relevance of the weakest-link hypothesis,
a comparison of datasets obtained for different sample sizes is necessary [23]. As a matter of
fact, the strength distributions reported in [21] are close to Gaussian distributions, with standard
deviations of the order of the means. It indicates that very low local strengths (less than 100 kPa)
are not unlikely. Note that a significant variability of the compressive strength has also been
observed for fresh-water artificial granular (isotropic) ice [24].
