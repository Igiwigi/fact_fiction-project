Here q is the proportion of maximum error in (6). The ‘03 may be supposed merged
in this and ¢=1'015¢’. Also & = é’+'04 from the fact that (10) and 3074017+4
are both d sequences (p. 412). Within the accuracy attainable for our present
purpose we may treat the ¢s as all equal. This was certainly not to be expected,
for the limit 8(%), obtained by formula constants from § lines, is in general
uncertain to a few units, whilst the ¢ and ¢, depending on limits found from
4(F and F) should be very small.
