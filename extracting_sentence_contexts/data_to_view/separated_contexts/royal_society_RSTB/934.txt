The constantly sharp outline of the mass of moving particles, whatever the actual
placement of its constituents, the persistent central cohesion, not only of possibly
nous matter, but of oil drops or grains of Indian ink, and an occasional lack of
hronism* in action, forbid the hypotheses that aggregation is due solely to the
. ipetal discharge of fluid into the vacuole from the surrounding protoplasm, or to
of a highly elastic lining film. On the other hand, all
h the view that the phenomenon is essentially one of

‘Phe vacuole of ingestion. This hypothesis finds further support in the con-
léfable staining power of food masses formed from coagulated proteid, as contrasted
it the reaction of the proteid particles before ingestion, in the persistent shrinking
WBbited by ingesta until they are stored, destitute of vacuoles, and in the phe-
yypenon of double aggregation (v. sup.). And certain secondary modifications of the
éement, which are observable at times, offer no hindrance to its adoption.
