These North force residuals seem to present a difficult problem, since they apparently
cannot be represented by any simple potential function. It may be recalled that the
amplitude of the semi-diurnal pressure variation seems to vary with latitude according
to the law sin* @, instead of sin* @ (or Q,*) as we have supposed ; the true law could
only be represented by the introduction of other harmonics besides Q,’ into our
theoretical calculations. Another fact worth noting is that the South component
of the semi-diurnal variation of wind velocity (at St. Helena) is markedly larger than
that calculated from Goxp’s theory* of the wind, barometric and temperature
variations, while the East component seems to be in agreement with theory. Such
