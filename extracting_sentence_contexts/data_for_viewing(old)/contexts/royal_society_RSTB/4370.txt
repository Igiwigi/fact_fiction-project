In a section of the developing tooth of a mouse (mus decumanus), one of the
animals investigated by von Brunn, in which the enamel had reached its downward
limit and the root was in process of formation, the enamel organ is seen to definitely
terminate at the point where the connective tissue of the follicle is attached to the
tooth. In this case a portion of the enamel has escaped thorough decaleification
and is seen in position (fig. 6). It is thus seen that in rodents as well as in man the
enamel organ would appear to be concerned solely with the formation of enamel
and is not prolonged as the Sheath of Hertwig.

I have examined a great many sections of developing teeth in the attempt to
account for the ordinarily received opinion with regard to the prolongation of. the
enamel organ downwards, and think the explanation lies in the fact that in early
germs the enamel organ is prolonged around the dentine papilla far beyond the
limits of the already formed or forming enamel, and appears to indicate the limit of
the future growth of this tissue. The curling inwards of the layers of the enamel
organ, compressing as it were the sides of the dentine papilla at its lower part, so
frequently seen, also suggests that it is continued on to the roots. If, however, a
tooth is examined in which the junction of the follicle with the dentine is shown, it is
seen that the external and internal layers of the enamel organ terminate at this point
and are not prolonged to the roots.

Figs. 5 and 8, which are photographs of the follicle at the point of junction with
the tooth, not only show the termination of the enamel organ in the angle formed by
the meeting of the two structures, but the elongated groups of epithelial cells which
