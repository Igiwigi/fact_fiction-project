compositeness.

In this presentation, we shall not be able to cover the status of all these searches. We will be
selective noting though that no strong indications of new physics have been found.

4. Searching for new physics at the Large Hadron Collider

(a) Supersymmetry

As noted above, SUSY doubles the fundamental particle spectrum. An example mass spectrum is
shown in figure 4. As an example, the electron should have a superpartner with the same mass.
No such particle has been found and so SUSY is presumed to be a broken symmetry. SUSY also
has a richer Higgs boson sector—in fact there are five Higgs bosons in minimal SUSY models. For
the class of spectra illustrated in figure 4, the mass of the super-partners of the third generation of
quarks (stop and sbottom) is relatively low (approx. 500 GeV). It is the quantum loops of the top-
stop quarks that matter most in the above-mentioned problem meaning that the mass difference
(top - Mstop) has to be small. This is sometimes labelled as a ‘natural’ scenario. It is therefore
particularly interesting to search for a ‘low’ mass stop.
