The Zoological position of Millepora.â€”The very prevalent idea that Millepora and
Hydractinia ave related to one another, must now be abandoned. The skeleton formed
by the former is calcareous, by the latter chitinous, the zooids of Mullepora are very
different in character from the zooids of Hydractinia, and lastly the phenomena of
sexual reproduction in the two genera are totally different. Indeed, beyond the facts
that they are both Hydrozoa with dimorphic zooids and a certain similarity of growth,
there are no points of relationship between them. I am inclined to believe that the Milleporide, together with the Stylasteride, belong
to a separate stock altogether from the Hydromedusz, a stock which never possessed
meduse or medusiform gonophores, . To this point I purpose to return in a subsequent
Memoir.
