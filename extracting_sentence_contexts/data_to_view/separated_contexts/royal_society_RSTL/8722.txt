G. 1. ROMANES ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF MEDUSM.

nite system of centres of spontaneity, or contractile tisme can afford, 80 to speak, to
retain more or less of its protoplasmic nature after spontaneity has become 80 far deve-
loped as to be localized in definite centres. Tn treating of this question, I will only
resort to theory when compelled to do 80 by the facts. From the observations already detailed it might well be concluded that the method
of inquiry by section has already settled the question before us, seeing that this
method has apparently reduced the hypothesis as to the presence of definite lines of
discharge to an absurdity. A moment's thought will render obyious how very trying
the spiral form of section already described (Plate 33) must be to any thing resembling
a neryous plexus, while a glance at fig. 3 would seem to render the suppoxition as to the
presence of any such plexus almost impossible.
