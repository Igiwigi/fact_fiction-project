Elaboration of external form is suggested (Polytrichum, Splachnum), but never

p Assimilation may be actively pursued in the sterile tissues, either in those of
sta (including the apophysis, Splachnum, &c.), or in the fertile part of the sporo-
3m (capsule of Anthoceros and most Mosses).

: Differentiation of tissues is fairly advanced in the seta of some Mosses.

sw under the above heads are included those features which, if collectively
‘@nt in one organism, might lead to the production of such more elaborate forms of

5 The subdivision of the archesporial layer to form isolated patches, instead of one
inuous tissue. Vith regard to the former—the origin of appendicular organs—we are still in the

tion, I wish it to be understood that the criticisms and suggestions now to be
de are offered only in the most tentative way, while it will remain to be seen how
they may be supported by the developmental facts to be described below.

st of the hypotheses hitherto advanced have been based upon the belief
