like in all animals with a longitudinal anal opening. Near its lateral margin opens on
each side a complicated musk-gland at the fundus of a deep recessus. The walls of
the latter can, like those of the gular musk-glands, be everted at will like the finger
of a glove, chiefly through the pressure of the superimposed M. sphincter transversus.
The smeary contents of the gland-bags are pressed out by the non-striped muscular
coating of the bags, from which runs a likewise non-striped cord to the crura penis.
It is generally supposed that through these strong scent-glands the sexes are enabled
to find each other, but besides this sexual advantage they seem to be used as warning

organs, an idea which is suggested by the fact that all these glands secrete already in
very young specimens, and that the vicious little Crocodiles (from one to two feet in
length) kept in my reptile-house evert them when very angry. On the ventral wall,
and immediately towards the outer side of the fold between the inner and outer
chamber, is situated the penis. Its epithelial coating is continuous with that of the
fold. The organ itself is attached to the caudal corner of the ischiadic symphysis by
a strong and roundish fibrous band (figs. 1 and 8), which arises single from the ventral
sides and forms partly the continuation of the two fibrous halves of the penis; the
bulk of the crura penis (comparable to. the corpora cavernosa) is not attached to the
pelvis, as generally stated, but projects backwards towards and into the pelvis.

This portion of the crura penis is decidedly rich in lacunz and other venous
cavernosities, and is in all probability able to be swelled.
