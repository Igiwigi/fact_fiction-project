The four-field case was taken far enough to show new interesting features,
with a connection to string theory noticed [7]. In retrospect, these investigations were over-influenced by the objective of finding explicit
compact contours for all channels, defined for finite-normed external fields. It would have been
more productive to concentrate on the formal momentum-space expressions, independent of
channel, which had in fact been introduced in Penrose’s original discussion of twistor diagrams


[5]. These expressions embodied a vital feature—that of manifest gauge invariance. Penrose’s
original Compton scattering diagram showed strikingly that a single diagram could embody a
gauge-invariant expression requiring the summation of two Feynman diagrams in the normal
representation.
