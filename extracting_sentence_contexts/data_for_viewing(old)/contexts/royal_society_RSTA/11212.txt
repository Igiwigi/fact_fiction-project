water.

From 50 per cent. nearly down to normal the coefficient a is related in a linear manner
to the concentration m, a result that may be expressed by means of the equation
a = 0°00293+4 qy\59m. In the case of ‘ water” we have reason to believe that there
is no appreciable “decay of ionisation” between 0°C. and 100°C., so that when m=0
we should have @=0. The rapid drop in the value of a, which actually occurs
below normal concentration, is not expressed by the above linear relationship, and
we have provisionally added a small term to the linear equation, which is then
made to read @ = 0:00293+4 3 \59m—0°000146/(m+435). The effect of this added
term is to make @=0 when m=0. We believe that further investigation will
justify some such addition, which hardly affects the figures for concentrations above
normal, and which corresponds roughly to the facts indicated by our incomplete
experiments on dilute solutions.

Having thus determined the relations of 1 and @ to the concentration from a study
of all the individual values for Ky, Ky, Kj), we now took the smooth values for x and a
given by the above expressions, and recalculated the values of b from the equation
log K = log K,+-1 log (1-++bt) —at, by substituting the experimental values of Ko,
and Ky, and the smooth values for n and a. The same process was repeated using
the experimental values of K,9 in place of those of Ky. In this way all the errors
of observation, whether from inaccurate reading or fouling of solutions or determina-
