Rirz has given the doublet series
just considered as VP, (1)—VP, (m),,.VP.(1)—VP, (m). We have seen, however, that
this cannot be the case.* Moreover, VP, (1)—VP, (m) for m= 1 would give an
infinite time of vibration, and would suggest instability. In fact, the configuration
giving this series, containing one very long period, is apparently very slightly stable. It is possible that the VP, (m) ought also to be slightly different, but the observations
are far too inexact to settle this. Again, Rypperre’s tables show that 7418 8., 5100 Lx., 4472 8. have denominators
about 2°845, 3°845, and 4°845, with a limit 27026.
