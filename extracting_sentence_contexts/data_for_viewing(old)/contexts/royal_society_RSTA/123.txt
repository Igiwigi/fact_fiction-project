Although the strongest absorption bands are found in the mid-infrared spectral
region, for measurements of COy and CHy, the weaker combination and overtone
bands found in the NIR are more useful. Yang et al. [12], repeating the analysis
of Wallace & Livingston [13] with updated retrieval methods and improved
spectroscopy, demonstrated that FTS measurements from the Kitt Peak National
Observatory could produce accurate and precise retrievals of Xco,, paving the
way for the development of the TCCON. A similar analysis was performed later
by Dufour et al. [14].

The precision and accuracy requirements for the TCCON are significantly
more exacting than those required or achieved to date by ground-based FTS
networks (e.g. NDACC). In fact, the precision requirement on the TCCON
Xco, is likely to be stricter than for satellite instruments such as the Orbiting

Carbon Observatory, which is calculated to be approximately 0.25 per cent (less
than 1 ppm) for global monthly means [15]. This is because of the reduced spatial
density of the TCCON observations, and because the TCCON measurements
must be more precise and accurate than the satellite measurements if they are
to provide a useful validation dataset. A modelling study is needed to assess the
