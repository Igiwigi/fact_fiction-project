Hence it is not diminished
temperature alone that induces a state of hybernation. Now during the confinement
of these individuals I examined other specimens of the same species, and found the
abdomen in each of them well filled with fat, while the respiratory organs appeared
to be diminished in calibre, and somewhat compressed by its accumulation. This
was particularly the case with one specimen which I examined, and the cireumstance
became the more interesting to me from a knowledge of the fact that both the amount
of respiration and the quantity of heat evolved by the insect are at this period dimi-
nished. But without going further with the causes of hybernation of insects, and
which do not directly belong to this subject, it may be inquired how it happens that
if the sleep of the hybernating insect be induced by a plethoric condition of body,
that there are certain species, as, for instance, the Anthophora retusa, STEPH., which
assume the perfect form and begin to hybernate during the swmmer, even at the end
of August, but do not leave their abodes until April or May in the following spring,
although the morning sun sbines brightly on their dwellings, and sometimes raises the
exterior surface of the bank in which they are deposited to a temperature of 80* Fans.
or upwards? Unto this it may be replied that the bodies of those insects, having 80
recently changed from the larva to the perfect state, are still provided with a full
supply of nourishment ; that the soil in which they are nidificating has not its tempe-
rature increased to a sufficient depth to arouse them into activity, and that even if
its temperature be sufficiently increased for a day or two, it does not continue at the
same standard, but gradually declines with the approach of autumn ; while on the
other hand, on the approach of spring the mean temperature of the atmosphere is
daily augmented, and the insect becomes aroused from its long slumbers by the
steadily increasing warmth of its dwelling ; its respiration is then excited, its fluids
circulate more quickly, and the nutriment stored up within its body when it entered
its sleeping condition having become exhausted, it is s00n stimulated by the calls of
hunger*, which the more perfect aeration of its fluids and the activity of all its func-
tions induce within it; it makes a powerful effort to escape from its prison house,
and pioneers its way through the s0il to a new life, a life of activity,â€”directed in
its proper course by the less consolidated state of the earth, in the passage to its
abode, with which, many months before, the careful parent bee had securely closed
the entrance, to protect her delicate offspring from the intrusion of enemies.
