long be placed at a distance of 1 m. from the anterior nodal point of the eye, and if
another object 0-5 cm. long be placed at a distance of 0-5 m. from the same point, then the
images formed of these objects on the retina will differ by 1:6 %, because 1 dioptre of
accommodation is required to change the focus of the eye from the more distant to the
nearer object. This fact may be stated in another way: the image of a given object on the
retina increases in linear dimensions by 101-6 %, when its distance from the anterior
nodal point of the eye is halved. The effect of doubling the size of the test object by using
some other distances is shown in table 79.

TABLE 79. ERROR PRODUCED BY DOUBLING THE SIZE OF AN OBJECT

smaller distance lm. 4m. 16 m.
larger distance 2m. 8m. 32 m.
change of focus 0-5D 0-125D 0-031D
error in size 0-8 % 02% 0-05 %

It will be seen from table 79 that, provided the distance between the observer and the
test object is not less than 2 m., the error due to a doubling of the size of the test object
does not exceed 1%.
