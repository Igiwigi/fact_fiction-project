Because of its simplicity, the ideal gas represents a quintessential system of reversible
thermodynamics. It may thus come as a surprise that within the ideal gas paradigm one can
quite easily attack issues related to irreversible thermodynamics. In fact, the only thing that is
required in this context is to understand the ‘mechanical interface’, namely the dynamics of the
piston that controls the volume of the ideal gas confined in a cylindrical vessel as it moves with
some phenomenologically relevant non-zero speed. We consider a cylindrical container merely
for a technical convenience and results obtained are by no means restricted to this particular
shape. For modelling, the mechanical interface one has to consider the statistics of elastic
collisions between gas particles and piston, leading to relations between macro observables.
