to the images to simulate lens defocusing. The effect of camera dynamic range on the identified
elastic Young’s modulus as well as the reconstructed stress-strain response during a simulated
spalling experiment starting from the generation of sequences of deformed synthetic grid images
is depicted in figure 11. The reconstructed stress-strain response was obtained from processing
the virtual strain gauge at 50mm from free end. The results for the mean identified Young’s
modulus as well as its standard deviation over the first 80 us (this corresponds approximately
to one full round trip) are presented in table 3.

As illustrated in figure 11a, simulations in the lower dynamic range can increase the temporal
variation in the identification of the elastic stiffness parameter. This becomes more obvious when
the mean stiffness values with corresponding standard deviations are evaluated (table 4). This
appears to be due to the fact that a capacity of 255 grey levels is just not sufficient to provide
a stable identification of the material parameters as illustrated by the difference between the
