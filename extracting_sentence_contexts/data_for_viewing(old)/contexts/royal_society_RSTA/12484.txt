The direct results of experiment are subject to some corrections befere they can be
applied to the calculation of the specific heat of the gas. The conditions of experi-
ment involve that the two spherical vessels have their specific heats compared when
each is filled with gas at the pressure of one atmosphere, and again when a further
weight (W grammes) of gas is compressed into one of them. It is necessary to
inquire whether the presence of the added quantity of gas does not give rise to any
thermal effect other than that due simply to its capacity for heat at constant volume
between the limits ¢; and fy.

1. Correction for Thermal Expansion of the Vessel.—The volume of the sphere
increases during the experiment by the thermal expansion of the copper. The gas in
the sphere is not, in fact, maintained at absolutely constant volume. The thermal effect
of this on the added quantity of gas, W, is evidently that which is to be considered.

The initial pressure due to W is affected negatively by the increased volume of the
sphere, positively by the rise of temperature. Work, ¢, is done by the expansion of
the gas through the increased volume of the sphere, and the thermal equivalent of
this must be deducted from the experimental result. Calling the initial volume V,,
and the initial pressure P,, at any moment during the rise of temperature.
