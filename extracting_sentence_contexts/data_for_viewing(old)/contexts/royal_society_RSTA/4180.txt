What is the physics of this? The model has two energy bands (which is why we can treat it as tw
a qubit), with a band gap that closes if m = 1 (figure 1). Kitaev found that in an open chain with a :
finite number of sites, the model behaves very differently depending on whether m <1 or m> 1. :3
In the former case, there are two extra states within the gap, which turn out to be exponentially [8
localized on the edges of the chain. In the latter case, these states are missing. In this sense, there :
is a kind of phase transition at m= 1.
In our model, we can discern a topological order parameter by looking at the Bloch vector
(2.6). As we move along the Brillouin zone, parametrized by k, the eigenstates move around the
equator of the Bloch sphere for 1 < 1, whereas for m > 1 they are rocking back and forth around
the east pole. In the former case, we pick up a Berry phase factor e'‚Äù; in the latter case, the Berry
phase is zero [15-17]. For m = 1, the gap closes and the Berry phase is ill-defined. Thus, we can say
