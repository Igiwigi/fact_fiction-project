has ſhewn us in the memoir I have already quoted ;
in which, without contending that air really ads as
a menſtruum with reſpe> to water, he demonſtrates,

cal, expreſſions concerning diffolutions may with
propriety be applied to deſcribe the ſeveral phe-

ſuſpenſion of water in air, as well as to its precipi=
tation under different forms. :

conclude things from words, I ſhould in fact think
theſe chemical expreſſions very conveniently adapted
to explain a number of theſe phznomena. But I
have rejected. them here, on account of this conſi-
deration ; that when, I took in a greater number
of phznomena, 1 found them no longer accurate,
