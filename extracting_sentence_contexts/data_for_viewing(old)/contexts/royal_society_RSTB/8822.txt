protein crystallography, radiation damage, 1. Introduction
X-ray lasers The determination of the structure of macromolecules at the atomic scale must

contend with the effect of radiation damage. To resolve features at this length
scale requires radiation of comparable wavelength or shorter, which, for X-rays
or electrons, will be energetic enough to ionize atoms and break bonds, leading
to changes in the very structure under investigation [1]. Any measurement of the
scattered radiation from a sample, such as X-ray diffraction from a protein crystal,
requires an adequate exposure for that recording. The energy transfer into the
sample during that exposure depends on the atomic cross sections for photo-
absorption relative to those for elastic scattering. The ratio of scattering to
absorption cross sections can be varied only by a change in wavelength, and
there is no way to avoid the fact that for every scattered X-ray photon there
are many more photons absorbed by the sample. Up until recently, the most suc-
cessful way to work within this fundamental constraint has been to grow large
well-diffracting crystals that yield strong diffraction within the damage-limited
exposure. Cryogenic cooling of the sample reduces some of the reactions that
occur subsequently to photoabsorption allowing for about a 30-50 times increase
in exposure [2-4]. A radical new approach to overcome the effects of radiation
damage has recently been demonstrated [5,6], using femtosecond flashes of
X-rays that are shorter than the time it takes atoms to move [7]. Doses that are
thousands of times higher than conventional limits have been achieved, which
allows for a corresponding reduction in crystal volume and measurable
diffraction from crystallites consisting of single mosaic blocks.
