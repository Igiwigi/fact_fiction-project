women who submit to or who court illegitimate union are physiologically different
from those whose powers of restraint are an efficient bar to such unions, the former
being endowed with more exceptionally active reproductive systems. If this be true
it would appear probable that the main factor influencing the increased production
of F. in this class of union must be an exceptionally active metabolism, which
favourably affects the development and ripening of ovarian ova which produce F.
(compare Heape, 1907 a), This suggestion is open to the objection that illegitimate unions do not produce a
sufficiently large proportion of F. to make such a view probable, and it is an objection
which may be urged against any proposal I have seen advanced to explain the facts. T would meet that objection by drawing attention to the fact that no doubt a large
proportion of illegitimate unions are due to dominant sexual activity alone, that it
is a common fallacy to suppose exceptional sexual activity is necessarily correlated
with exceptional reproductive activity (metabolism), and that when the latter does
not exist there would, on my hypothesis, be no special stimulus exerted in favour of
the production of F.

Tt is not advisable to burden this communication with a detailed survey of the
evidence I have collected in favour of the view that sexual and reproductive activity
are not necessarily correlated, I would only add that such is my strong opinion. If I am right in my main contention, the conclusion cannot be avoided, that the
causes which induce variation in the proportion of the sexes conceived in consequence
of legitimate union on the one hand and illegitimate union on the other, cannot in any
way be explained by the laws of heredity but have direct relation to the conditions
prevailing at the time of conception.
