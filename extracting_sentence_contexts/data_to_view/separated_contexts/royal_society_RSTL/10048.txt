In addition to an examination of the excretory organs in situ, which showed little i
except the presence of the generative ridges, we made a complete xeries of sectiong |
through the excretory organs for their whole length (Plate 26, figs. 54-57). i

Posteriorly these sections showed nothing worthy of note, the excretory organs and |
their ducts differing in no important particular from these organs as we haye described
them in the adult, except in the fact that the segmental ducts are not joined by the
oviducts. Some little way in front of the point where the two segmental ducts coalesce to
form the urinary bladder, the genital ridge comes into view. For its whole extent,
except near its anterior part (of which more hereafter) this ridge projects freely into
the body-cavity, and in this respect the young Fish differs entirely from the adult.
