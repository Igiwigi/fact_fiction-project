When the salt last described was exposed on the solder-bath for several days
at a temperature between 400* and 470), it lost weight ; only 3:48 parts out of
the entire 35'57 water were retained in one experiment, and 2-81 parts water in
another. The whole water was expelled, with the exception of 0:38 to 100 dry
salt, in other experiments in which the salt was heated on the sand-bath, proba-
bly at a temperature not much under 600?. The salt became in fact very nearly
anhydrous. Now on pouring water upon the salt s0 dried, the greater part of
it-dissolved at once, but an inconstant quantity remained undissolved, varying
from 6:57 to 18 parts in 100 salt, but increasing with the intensity of the heat
to which the salt had been exposed. This insoluble matter is a fourth variety
of the biphosphate, which shall immediately be noticed.
