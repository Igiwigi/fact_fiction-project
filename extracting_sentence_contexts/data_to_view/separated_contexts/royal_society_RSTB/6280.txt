Morphology and Histology—The nature of the “ rods ” : The occurrence of “ rods ”
in individuals of this species is constant enough to be a diagnostic character. Else-

genus T7yplasma, and in Cantrillia, and they are characteristic of such species whatever
the horizon or locality. These facts, with the constancy of their shape and size and
positional relation to the spines, show that they are either appearances dependent
on the original structure of the spine, or original parts of it. It is conceivable that
the appearance of rods in transverse and vertical sections of a spine could be obtained
without the actual presence of rod-like bodies, provided that the spine consisted of
fibres directed radially upwards. Such appearances are sometimes observed in the
septa of Recent Corals, when dark rod-like areas follow the grain of the fibres, and
