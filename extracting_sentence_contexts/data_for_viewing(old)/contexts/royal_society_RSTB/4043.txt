Henprerson the average pulse pressures on the Peak were practically the same as in
Colorado Springs and New Haven. It may be noted further (Table XXIIL) that in
Rostson and in Russett (considering the high systolic pressure of the latter) in spite
of their prolonged residence on the Peak, the pulse pressures were not unusually large.
In the case of Rosrson this observation is especially significant in view of the fact
that he has an unusually athletic physique, leads a very active life, and holds the
record for the most rapid ascent of the Peak ever made, viz., 2 hours and 31 minutes
for the 6000 and odd feet from Manitou.

Cheyne-Stokes breathing was of such common occurrence upon the Peak that
frequent opportunities were afforded for noting the coincident variations in the
circulation. These consisted in a slight quickening of the pulse and rise of arterial
pressure just before and during the periods of breathing, and a corresponding slowing
and fall of pressure as the respiratory pauses set in. Thus, for example, in HaLpANE
a few hours after arrival on the summit it was observed that during the apnoeas the
pulse rate was 63 in five seconds, systolic pressure 94, diastolic 56, and pulse pressure
38, while just before and during the return of respiration the pulse rose to 8 in
