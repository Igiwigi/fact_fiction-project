1— INTRODUCTION The estimation of the aldehyde and “ peroxide” content of the sample gas
described in Part I indicated that the ‘“‘ peroxides ” were formed before inflamma-
tion, and that the occurrence of “‘ knock ”’ was in some way related to them ; for
the amount of such “ peroxides ” was greater under knocking conditions. Hardly
any “ peroxides ” were found using benzole ; in fact, benzole appeared to destroy
them. Since nitrogen peroxide could be detected by the Griess reagent in that part
of the stroke where no “ peroxides ”’ affecting potassium iodide were obtained, the
pronounced maximum in the “ peroxide”’ curve did not seem to be connected
with the formation of NO,. The effect of the addition of aldehydes, however,
seemed to prove that the “ peroxides ” were not formed as a result of the oxidation
of aldehydes.
