and 4 27", when, according to calculation, it should have occurred at 3" 339, On March
11, 1859, the sï¬†ky was intensely blue; the phase of equal colour appeared, under a
pressure of 09-764, in the morning at 7* 42" instead of 8" 22m, From these experi-
ments, it is not only secn that these phases which the theory requires actually occur,
but also that the agreement between the observed and calculated time of appearance of
these phases is very close. The point at which the phenomenon is observyed in the
morning is indeed about forty-five minutes earlier than the calculated point, whilst in

the afternoon the calculated is about thirty minutes earlier than the observed point.
These differences are, however, satisfactorily explained by the fact, that, in the situation
at which the observations were made, the horizon towards north, west, and east is not
free, owing to the hills of the Neckar Valley which rise 12 above the horizon, in con-
8equence of which a deviation in the direction observed must occur.

We pass now to the consideration of the total chemical effect which the direct swn-
light, varying with the time of day, produces on a unit of area lying in the plane of the
Horizon during a given time.

As has been already shown, the formula

gives the chemical effect (W,) which the sun's rays exert on a horizontal unit of surface
