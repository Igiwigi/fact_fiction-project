either physically or optically ; in the latter case it is not unlikely that in a faint nebula
they might be seen separate with an instrument of great aperture, while in the
brighter and more closely packed nebula they were blended together, owing to imper-
fect definition, arising out of the state of the air, or instrument. As an example, the
dumb-bell is a bright nebula: on three exceedingly fine nights sncceeding each other
at short intervals, the stars in the brighter parts of the nebula were better shown
with 3 feet aperture than they have since been with 6 feet. Very fine nights, when
the air seems to set no limits to magnifying power, are extremely rare, and the dumb-
bell has not been seen with the great instrument, on such nights. On the other
hand, on all ordinary nights, a variety of details are shown by the great instrument
which were not seen on the finest nights with the smaller instrament. There is
another fact I may perhaps add, that while high magnifying power brings out minute
stars it extinguishes faint nebulosity. The optical reason is obvious ; but in sketching
the dumb-bell nebula in 1845 that fact was overlooked, and but one eye-piece was
used, a very high one; had there been a low one also used the sketch would have
been more complete. To return to the annular nebule. The five planetary nebulz
we have ascertained to be annular, are as follows : 464, Plate XXXVIII. fig. 12, has
two stars within it; 2075 has one star a little following the centre; 2241, Plate
XXXVIII. fig. 13, has no star, but is surrounded with a faint external annulus ;
2050 has a perforation not round nor quite symmetrical with the star ; 838, Plate
XXXVII. fig. 11, has two stars and two perforations. In no instance is the central
opening quite dark. The planetary nebula, 2047, is marked in our journal as annular,
but the observation is without date and other particulars, and therefore I do not
consider it altogether trustworthy. In 2098, Plate XXXVIII. fig. 14, another
