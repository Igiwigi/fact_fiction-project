nature of the lubricant and of the solids, provided the surfaces are clean.

(2) The distance is the same in clean air as it is when the air is displaced by a liquid
and remains the same until the pressure of the air is reduced to 2 mm. of mereury.

(3) The distance in clean air was decreased by contaminating the solid faces.
(4) The difficulty with which a cylinder can be forced down on to a plate and the
relative ease with which it can be wrung down.

Of these the two first are perhaps accounted for by the fact that on either hypothesis
the pressure P is the difference between two quantities, both of which may be functions
of the nature of the lubricant and of the solids. P may then be a pure function of the
geometry of the system over an extremely wide range of conditions.

The effect of the contaminant seems to point to the conclusion that the attraction
of the solid is not a shadowless force as Laplace assumed, but a force which, like chemical
affinity, can be saturated. The effect may, however, be due simply to the contaminant
making the surface irregular.

The relative efficacy of wringing is no doubt due to purely mechanical action. In
wringing a cylinder down on to a plate the surfaces are not kept parallel, the resistance
encountered is therefore at no time equal to the pressure P (at the least distance between
