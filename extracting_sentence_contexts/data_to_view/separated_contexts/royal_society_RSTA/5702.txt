Indeed, it was shown for fluids that, if a singularity (in the sense of a
finite-time blow-up of vorticity) occurs, then the curvature of vortex lines blows up as well [122];


but what of torsion, the third element in the Serret-Frenet frame, which can be associated with
helicity? This may well be an open problem, and similarly for MHD. In fact, the role of helicity
in such singular structures was emphasized again recently [123] in the framework of the Clebsch
variable formalism. Similarly, one could ask what role, if any, helicity might have for turbulence
in non-integer dimension, studied in [124] using a fractal Fourier decimation, possibly e.g. with
the help of fractional derivatives [125]. Moreover shear, an integral part of the definition of helicity, has been shown recently, for
rotating and/or stratified fluids as well as for (Hall)-MHD turbulence, to have a central role in the
formation of strong small-scale localized structures, an interpretation of which can be performed
for example in the framework of critical phenomena [126-128].
