Since the amounts of
CO, to be determined were so large, there was no objection to using this shorter time
interval. The true temperature of the leaf was not determined in these preliminary
experiments, but must have been several degrees higher than that of the bath, This

is clearly shown by the fact that the value obtained for the assimilation when the
bath was at 11Â° C., is considerably higher than the amount shown in Section IV.
(ii) to be maximal for that temperature. The highest value for the assimilation we have found occurs in Experiment L. I believe that this is also the highest value recorded by any observer.
