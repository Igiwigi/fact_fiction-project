method was not free from error. The maximal rise obtained by StTRASBURGER was
26 centims. of mercury with herbaceous plants, the plants usually drooping some
time before this tension was reached. Woody Dicotyledons generated suctions
of 45 (Wistaria) to 67 centims. The highest values were given when the lower end
was boiled to drive out air,* but even then tender leaves soon. droop, and the
experiment always ends in the entry of air. By closing the cut surface and allowing
the water to enter through the surface of the wood of a Conifer, a suction of as much
as 70 centims. was shown, and since the branches were 2 metres long and erect, the
total head was greater than the atmospheric pressure. Vinest has shown that dead
branches may ultimately generate as high a suction as living ones, and in fact the
higher suctions are more the result of imbibition forces than of leaf suction.
Ordinary transpiring leaves should theoretically be able to transmit an osmotic
suction of several atmospheres to the vessels, whereas as soon as the tension in the
vessels reaches 4—} of an atmosphere, the transpiration current is either strongly
retarded or entirely stopped, even when short lengths of stem are used. Long
lengths of stem do not develop a higher but usually a lower suction than short ones.
Thus, 31 feet of a leafy Wistaria stem developed a maximal suction of 32 centims. of
mercury, and this in 15 minutes, instead of the 40 or more centims. suction which
shorter stems may show. A similar stem was so arranged with a water valve that
the mercury could not be raised above 25 centims., and in this case although no air
was drawn back from the stem for over two hours, the leaves were drooping
slightly at the end of the first hour (23° C. and sunny), and strongly at the end of
