t An erroneous idea with regard to the indications of the temperature of the stars has been held by
pee who haye not considered the matter specially. It has been imagined that the presence of the
mies of hydrogen lines iri the ultra-violet was of itself sufficient evidence of a very high temperature.

experiments of Cornu! however, have shown that the complete series of lines can be seen with an
dinary spark without jar. Hence, the high temperature of such a star as Sirius is not indicated by

fact that its spectrum shows the whole series of hydrogen lines, but by the fact that there is bright
ntinuous radiation far in the ultra-violet.
