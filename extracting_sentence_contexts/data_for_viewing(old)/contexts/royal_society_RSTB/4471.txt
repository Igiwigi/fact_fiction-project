It has been shown in the above study of the failure in longitudinal compression of
Spruce, Ash, and Pitch Pine, that the planes of slipping are always inclined
differently from the planes of inclination of the slits of the pits, and generally form
a high angle with them. In Spruce, for example, the slits of the pits are steeply
inclined, and only form a small angle with the axis of the cell, as seen in surface
view. The slip-lines run transversely across the surface of the walls of the thin-
walled cells or are inclined at a high angle (more than 45°) in the thick-walled cells.
In both cases the lines run obliquely in the section of the wall, but at an angle of
more than 45°, to the long axis of the cell.

The displacement for compression failures is thus never along the planes of the
slits of the pits, and, except for the fact that the inclination of the slip-planes to the
direction of stress is always greater than 45°, the behaviour of the material of
the walls is such as might be expected from an isotropic substance.

The anisotropy of the cell-walls, as regards their mechanical properties, is more
striking in connection with the different behaviour in tension and compression. It is
well known that the strength of wood is much greater in longitudinal tension than
in end-compression. The different microscopical characters of the fractures can be
correlated with this difference. It has been seen that increasing stress in end-
compression leads to the development of increasing numbers of slip-planes in the
substance of the walls, but that actual rupture rarely, if ever, oceurs along these,
failure being finally manifested by buckling and crinkling of the fibres. In tension
there is a greater resistance to the development of slip-planes, and very few of these
