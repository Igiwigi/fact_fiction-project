sequently carried out in R (v. 3.1.2) [55] using specific packages
where necessary (see below).

To validate our simulation approach, we compared our esti-
mates of species richness at equilibrium with those expected for
point mutation and random fission, given the size of our meta-
community (Jm=1 million individuals) and per capita
speciation rates (v). For the point mutation mode of speciation,
the number of species expected at equilibrium is given by
Seq = 1+ 6 In(1 + [me — 1]/6) [1], where 6 is the fundamental
biodiversity number. Under the Moran model with overlapping
generation, our case, 6 = Jyv/(1 — v), or more exactly (J — 1)v/
(1 — v), to account for the fact that an offspring could not take
over the parental cell. Importantly, we do not calculate @ as Hub-
bell [1] originally did (@=2Jyv), which only applies to the
Wright—-Fisher model with non-overlapping generations
[56,57]. For the random fission mode, the number of species
expected at equilibrium is given by Seq = Juv? [58,59]. Very
close agreement (less than 1% discrepancy) was found between
the number of species estimated at equilibrium in our simu-
lations with global dispersal and the above theoretical
predictions for the random fission and point mutation modes
of speciation, with little variation between replicate runs
(electronic supplementary material, table S2).
