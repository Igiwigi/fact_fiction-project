synsacral intercentrum does not display any differentiation into an interventral and
basiventral division. The synsacral intercentrum is laid down in the mesenchyme of
the ventral-most (subchordal) portion of the fused cranial and caudal sclerotomites of
a sclerotome and occupies at its first origin a strictly intrasclerotomic (= intervertebral)
position. These facts explain the paired character of the synsacral intercentra and the
absence of a transverse groove on the ventral surface of them in comparing them with the
intercentra of the cervical and the anterior portion of the thoracic region. Empryo or Struthio Australis, AGED ABour 8 Days.â€”CrrvicaL REGION. The perichordal tube which in 4-day Larus and in 7-day Struthio exhibits a more or
less uniform structure throughout, has become differentiated into two kinds of struc-
turally different segments alternating regularly with each other.
