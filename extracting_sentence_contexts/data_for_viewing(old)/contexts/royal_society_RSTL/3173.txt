'The slight excess of carbon in the third analysis, if not an error of experiment, in-
dicates that the heating had been carried a little too far; while the similar excess
both of carbon and hydrogen in the resin dried only at 212*, would imply the pre-
sence of a yolatile carbo-hydrogen, which is wholly expelled only after long-continued
heating. A familiar example of the presence of such a volatile compound, we have in
the association of oil of turpentine with common resin ; and the fact that most of the
resins yield on distillation with water a volatile oil, gives ground for believing that
the presence of substances analogous to oil of turpentine may tend more or less to
modify or vitiate the results obtained by the analyses of resinous bodies, when suffi-
cient precautions are not taken to ensure their expulsion.

HI. Resins precipitated by Caustic Potash.—The precipitate thrown down by
caustic potash from the alcoholic solution of the sandarach of commerce, dissolyed
readily in a hot dilute solution of caustic potash. From this solution largely diluted
with water, the resin was precipitated by dilute muriatic acid, and afterwards wasbed
on a filter till it ceased to render the water acid. Being then boiled in water, dried
at 212”, and digested with boiling alcohol, only a small quantity was taken up. The
