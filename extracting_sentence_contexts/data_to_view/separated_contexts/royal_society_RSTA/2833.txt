Work on the nature and origin of these deposits is ongoing.

(c) Foraminiferal accumulation rates

Wright & Schaller [19] suggested that the sedimentary cyclicity was seasonal, lending a decadal
scale to the onset recorded at the coastal plain sites. This interpretation is contrary to the available
foraminifera mass accumulation rate (MAR) data from near the middle of the clay at Wilson
Lake, which suggests a lower sedimentation rate [110]. However, a closer inspection of these rates
shows that they are in fact compatible with very rapid deposition of the base of the Marlboro Clay
where foraminifera are extremely rare. Near the mid-point of the Marlboro Clay, the foraminifera
abundance is approximately 200 specimens g~! of sediment [110]. Using numerous lines of
evidence, Stassen et al. [110] suggest that the sedimentation rate for this part of the Marlboro
Clay is approximately 16 cm kyr~.
