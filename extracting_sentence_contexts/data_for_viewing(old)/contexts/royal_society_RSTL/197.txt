is evident they are teeth of the same kind, only of very different
SIZES.

This resemblance led me to examine the mode of dentition
of this unknown animal, as far as could be done from the
specimens preserved in this country, to see if any resemblance
could be traced between it and that of the wild boar.

From the different specimens of these fossil teeth deposited in
