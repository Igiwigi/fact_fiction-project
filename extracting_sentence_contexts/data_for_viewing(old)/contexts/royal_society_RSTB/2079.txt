are described as indusiate: It may be that in Laccopteris there was no indusium,
but in Microdicyton the sori were indusiate. ZErLLER,|| in a footnote to his paper on
Tong-King fossils, refers to a figure by Heer of Laccopteris as suggesting the presence
of an indusium, but in his later paper‘! he considers the sori to have been naked. It
> is exceedingly difficult to determine whether or no an indusium was present in these
fossil sori, and the ease with which the indusium of Matonia is detached emphasises
the danger of drawing conclusions as to the indusiate or non-indusiate condition of
certain kinds of fossil sori. The fossil Matonidium was probably indusiate, and the
appearance of some at least of the species referred to Microdictyon points undoubtedly
to the existence of an indusium; the occurrence of fertile pinnse of Laccopteris in
which the outline of the sporangia are distinctly shown, is no proof that an indusium
was never present. In an older leaf, which had been exposed to the air before being
; embedded in sediment, the circular indusium might very readily fall off. The fact,
therefore, that in some of the specimens referred to Microdictyon the sori appear to be
indusiate, does not in itself afford an obstacle in the way of uniting Saporra’s
Microdictyon to Laccopteris (including Phlebopteris).

Specimens conforming to the Laccopteris (Microdictyon) type have been recorded
from Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks of England,** Germany, France, Portugal,
Belgium, Austria, Italy, Russia, Bornholm, Switzerland, Australia, and elsewhere.

It is probable that the fragments of a fern described by HeER*+ from the Cretaceous
