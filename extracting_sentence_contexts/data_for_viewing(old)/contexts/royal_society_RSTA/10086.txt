The records which have been published since this investigation was first begun
enable us to add more than one complete column to those which I have used, and
these have been entered in the table.

13. The principal period which gives the present sunspot curve its characteristic
shape deserves treatment in detail. Fig. 4 shows the average variation of the six
sunspot cycles included between 1833-1899. The curve gives the rise and fall of the
annual value of the mean daily area, while the crosses indicate the position of the
points through which the curve would pass if deduced from Wotr's sunspot numbers.
The close proximity of the crosses to the curve shows that, at any rate as far as the
long-period variations are concerned, Worr’s numbers are proportional to the sunspot
areas, and that the factor I have used is sufficiently accurate. The figure also
illustrates the fact that Wotr’s numbers underrate somewhat the activity near the
times of a maximum, as has already been pointed out in § 1. But this deficiency is
apparent throughout the rising branch of the curve. This points to a systematic
difference in the sunspot statistics before and after the maximum, I have carefully
examined the sunspot records as far back as the Greenwich records allow me to do
so, and there seems indeed to have been a tendency during the 20 available years
towards larger average areas (and also average duration) of spots during the rise as
compared with the fall in the sunspot cycle. This would explain the deviations of
Wo tr's numbers from the curve marking the areas.
