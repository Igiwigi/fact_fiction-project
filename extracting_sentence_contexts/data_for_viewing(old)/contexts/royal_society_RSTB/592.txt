In fact here the part of the occipital lobe on the outside of the calcarine fissure and
of the lateral ventricle is merged with the part of the occipital lobe which is below
that fissure. :

The fibres of the cingulum still have the appearance of being cut across, and sub-
sequently the most internal fibres of the hinder part of the internal capsule, which,
in previous sections proceeded to the extreme posterior part of the occipital convolu-
tions, now turn sharply round the lateral ventricle into the neighbourhood of the
cingulum. This is owing to the fact that we have now reached a level near to the
inferior surface of the occipital lobe, which, as we shall see further on, disappears
altogether from the sections. At the same time the posterior cornu of the lateral
ventricle gradually becomes shorter, receding from behind forwards, till at this level
it does not extend farther back than the cingulum, in fact it almost ceases to exist as
such.

In the next section the cingulum appears to consist of two parts, an external
part associated with the system of fibres bounding the outer or ventricular surface of
the cornu Ammonis and forming what is known as the alveus (see p. 188), and an
inner set of fibres situated between the apex of the cingulum (as here seen) and the
projection formed by the anterior border of the central medullary substance of the
temporo-sphenoidal lobe. This latter is the part of the cingulum into which the
fibres from the internal capsule (described above) seem to end. This division, though,
perhaps, not very marked at this point, becomes more so further down,

In the next sections we get below the level of the occipital convolutions, and from
