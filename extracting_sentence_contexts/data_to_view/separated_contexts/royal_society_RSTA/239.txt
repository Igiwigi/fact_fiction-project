Helfrich left RCA in
October 1970, made the first TN cells in November, submitted a patent with
Schadt on 4 December (Helfrich & Schadt 1970) and a letter to Applied Physics
Letters 3 days later (Schadt & Helfrich 1971). Such a rapid sequence of conception
and construction is unusual. In fact, as Helfrich admitted 20 years later, he had
thought of the TN effect in 1969, and other ex-RCA staff confirmed this. However,
he made little attempt to attract management interest, since, as he explained, he
was there to help theoretical understanding, not to invent devices. RCA made no
attempt to invalidate the patent or to claim ownership, possibly because there
were further legal complications (Kawamoto 2002).
