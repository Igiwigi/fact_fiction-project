In this part of the work the methods and procedure adopted were as follows :â€”

During the spring and summer I grew a number of seedlings of various species of
Bromes in the closed tubes adapted for the pure culture of Uredines as described in
1901,* and when the plants had developed the second and third leaves I carefully
infected these, at definite spots, with Uredo-spores from a definite host--sometimes
the same species, sometimes another. In other tubes, highly predisposed species of
the grass were grown, but were not infected, the object being to see if any difference
in the cells could be detected. The latter, in fact, served as control plants. The spores placed on the leaves rapidly germinated and commenced to infect the
latter at the spots marked. Some of the specimens in course of being infected were removed from the tubes
after the first 24 hours, and the spore-laden spots cut off and preserved.
