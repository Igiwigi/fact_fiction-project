This argument depends on a key non-degeneracy property of the :
function ®, more precisely on what we call the restricted non-degeneracy condition aa)

This condition, which appears to be new, can be verified explicitly in our case, when | |& — n| — :3

the mixed Hessian of @ is a standard condition that leads to optimal L? bounds on Fourier integral
operators. In our case, however, we have the additional cut-off function y<,((&,7)), so we can
only integrate by parts in the directions tangent to the level sets of ©.
