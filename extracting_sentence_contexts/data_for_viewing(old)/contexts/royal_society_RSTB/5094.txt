The loss of the connection with the skull results in such freeing of the head as allows
of lateral movement, a motion which becomes more and more restricted, and finally
lost by the development of a pair of well-separated exoccipital condyles in later
Labyrinthodonts.

This possible lateral motion of the head is most readily carried out by cranio-clavicular
muscles, and the range of action of these muscles can only be increased by lengthening
them, such lengthening is most conveniently done by cutting away the anterior
borders of the clavicles and cleithra. Thus attached from both edges these then
become converted into narrow rods.

This analysis presupposes that the shoulder girdle lies some way behind the skull.
This is in fact the case in all Embolomeri, but in later Labyrinthodonts, and the early
reptiles, the shoulder girdle moves up to the head, presumably to decrease the load
carried by the fore limbs. Such situation must have entirely prevented lateral
movements of the head.

Another change of importance found in the secondarily aquatic Labyrinthodonts is
an immense widening of the lower ends of the clavicles, the mechanical meaning of this
arrangement is obscure, but it is clearly a condition following on the terrestrial type
just described. It occurs even in the Lower Carboniferous Pholidogaster and gives
still further evidence of the great age of the Amphibia.

The structure of the pelvis of the Embolomeri is fish-like in one respect. In them the
ilium shows no trace of rib attachment, and bears a long posterior process. The perfect
