However, it turns out that the boundary conditions (3.2) give rise to continuous families of
trajectories originating from the U(1)-gauge invariance, i.e. from the fact that if w(t) solves the
equations of motion under the boundary conditions (3.2) then w(te' also does. Therefore, one of
the 2L integrations, e.g. the one over q, cannot be performed in stationary phase approximation. In fact, it turns out to be beneficial to transform the integrations over qt! ) into integrations

over afi! defined by

ay =2b,/ a + 3 cos(6(” + a), (3.3)
q? =2by n + 4 cos(ol? +00), for >1 (3.3b)

and a = 2b n® + 3 cos(a\”). (3.3c)

Then one can perform all the integrations except the one over a in stationary phase
approximation, yielding again the stationarity conditions (3.2) with

The evaluation of the exponent at the stationary points yields the classical action of the
resulting classical trajectories

It is easy to see that—again due to conservation of particles—the classical action (3.6) is
independent of the initial global phase of. Furthermore, the semiclassical prefactor, which is derived in appendix C, turns out to be
