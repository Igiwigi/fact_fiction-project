K (8, %) = k(m%, s) = 0. In other words, if we draw the square Q and the diagonal s = ¢, the existence of a
point (%, %) on this diagonal at which «(s, ¢) vanishes involves the fact that «(s, ¢)
vanishes everywhere on the lines drawn through this point parallel to the axes of s
and ¢. In particular, we deduce from this that @ function «(s, t) which is of positive
type, and is not zero everywhere in Q, cannot vanish everywhere on the diagonal s = t.

More generally, let us suppose that there are points %, %, ..., % of the interval
