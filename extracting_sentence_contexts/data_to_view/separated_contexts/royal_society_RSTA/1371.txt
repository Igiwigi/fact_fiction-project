Figure 2 presents the change in runoff for a 7% increase in precipitation for various loss values
and changes in loss. Where the fraction lost is zero, the runoff change is constant, in line with
the precipitation increase. But even if there is no change in the loss fraction, as long as losses
occur, the precipitation increase does not traslate to the same percentage change in the runoff,
and in fact is higher that the precipitation change. If future conditions become wetter (x <1),
say due to increased mean rainfalls, the loss fraction decreases, and the runoff change is greater
than the precipitation change. Alternatively if future conditions become drier (x > 1), say due to
greater evaporation and less rainfall lowering soil moisture content, the percentage change in
runoff is less than the percentage change in precipitation.
