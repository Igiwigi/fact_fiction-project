intensity of this correlation depends upon the correlation between the sizes of arrays
of uncles and nephews, a quantity which may be very small, or not, according to the
nature of the record. Hence it appears necessary in applying the method to make
some attempt to appreciate the value of o, as well as o,. If this be done R can be
found from (xxix.), if not directly. This value of R is not without importance for
the inheritance of characters latent in one or other sex.

We have thus reduced the correlations of individuals to a calculation of the corre-
lation of arrays.

material with correlated material.
The importance of this investigation lies in the fact that death, restraint, or other

circumstances, completely screen, in a certain number of cases, both the potential
fertility and the real fecundity of man. Precisely similar circumstances, which will be
considered more at length later, hinder our obtaining in horses a true measure of
fecundity for all cases. We are thus really dealing with a mixture of correlated and
apparently uncorrelated material. In what manner does the influence of this
mixture effect our results ? F
