11 gives the curves drawn from the above tables. It should be remarked that from the measurements we have made in London, the
solar curve varies considerably according to the direction of the wind. A wind from
the east diminishes the intensity of the blue end of the spectrumâ€”a fact no doubt
due to the 8moke haze which is then prevalent. We omitted in our paper to point out the method by which the prismatic spectrum
curve can be converted into the normal spectrum curve. It will be seen that a
very approximate curve can be obtained by using I or - as the factor by which the
ordinates of the curves in the former can be reduced to the latter.
