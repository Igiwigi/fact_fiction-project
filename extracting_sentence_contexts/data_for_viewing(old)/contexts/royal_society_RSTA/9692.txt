point. Without, however, giving any special weight to the exactness of the
agreement, it yet affords strong evidence for the dependence of the p-sequence on the
real atomic volume in the manner indicated. If Eu behaves in an analogous way we
should expect it to be proportional to 7», #.e., ‘244083 = ‘002720x7» or v = 12°86,
whence, taking the atomic weight of Eu to be 152'03,* the density of Eu at ordinary
temperatures should be about 11°86, 7.¢., intermediate between those of Cd and Hg,
as is to be expected.

In the case of the alkaline earths we have to consider the two forms of the
sequence—(1) that involving Bm~*, and (2) that in which multiples of A, are added to
give the first spectral line of the series. Also, in the first form the question arises
whether the quantity to be discussed should be the denominator of VS (1) or with 8
left out. Tn fact, if the atomic volume term is the factor ~« when the denominator is
thrown into a form containing a term «(1—°21520m-'), then the quantity to be
considered would be the latter, assuming the results given in (p. 41). For comparison
both eases are treated, 1 (a) and 1 (6), in the table below. The fourth line gives the
numbers for Case (2). As in the Zn sub-group it will be found that multiples of

v enter.
