234 MR. HERON-ALLEN: CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STUDY OF THE

recognised fact:! The living Foraminifer is apparently sensitive to light? I had
oceasion to prove this, by taking advantage of the fact, in photographing the
Gromiide to which reference has been made, of which a specimen appears in figs. 9
and 10. In that case, the Gromia having become lost among weeds, a small hole
was punched in a piece of black paper and affixed to the glass side of the tank, and
a beam of strong light directed through it; within an hour three independent
specimens of Gromia had crawled into the circle of light thus formed.â€™
