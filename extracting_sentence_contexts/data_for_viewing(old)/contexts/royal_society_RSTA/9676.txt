The removal of our metal block and its replacement by another was a lengthy
business, requiring considerable care, as all the soldered joints in the various electrical
circuits had to be separated and remade, the brass case removed and opened, &c.

It was not possible to complete the operation in less than several hours, and the
temperature of the tank necessarily suffered some alteration in the process. On re-
establishing the system, small consequential changes in the balancing point on the
bridge might have occurred, or, at all events, the absence of any such changes had to
be ascertained. Thus, it was necessary to allow time for the newly inserted block to
settle to the tank temperature, and, as its approach to that temperature was slow and
asymptotic, at least a day or two had to elapse before the “zero” point could be
ascertained with certainty. The importance of this matter is indicated by the fact

that an error of 0°1 bridge-wire division (= 0°°007 Pt) in the estimation of the zero
point would affect conclusions derived from an experiment of average length by the
total heat method by (in the case of Cu, for example) 5 parts in 9000. In our
earlier “total heat” experiments we had not realized the importance of this zero
reading, and this no doubt is the cause of certain discrepancies.
