and one can derive a simple expression for EM(T) there under the assumption that the nanoflare-
heated loop cools from Tm to below 1 MK [7,45]. The emission around any given temperature will
be proportional to the time the plasma spends there, so EM(T) ~ nM tad, Where Traq ~ T!%/n is
the instantaneous radiative cooling time. With T ~ n? in the radiative phase (§3), the result EM ~
T?/2-¢ ~ T? arises from a simple fit to the radiative losses. For T ~ n!, EM ~ T!/!+1-e [45]. For the
relatively short hot loops seen in AR cores, | = 2 is reasonable, so that a = 3.1 suggests the loop may
have inhibited cooling below Tm. Warren et al. [39] interpreted this as being evidence for ‘steady’
heating through a one-dimensional hydro simulation that had Ty ~ 150s. Figure 2b shows that
HF nanoflares produce a very sharp emission peak around Tym, suggesting that this value of Ty
may be too small. On the other hand, a LF nanoflare model gives too broad a distribution with
slope a=2.17.

In fact, the values of a found in [39-42] suggests that there are a range of AR properties
some with Ty > Teo and some with the opposite property. The EBTEL approach was used to
investigate many hundreds of possible heating models involving lengthy nanoflare ‘trains’ such
as shown in figure 1 with different nanoflare energy distributions [34]. It was concluded that
only nanoflare trains where (i) the time between each event was proportional to the energy of the
second event and (ii) the nanoflares had a power law distribution were satisfactory. Nanoflares
that were equally spaced in time could not reproduce the range of values of a even though
they had random or power law energy distributions. The difficulty lay in obtaining values of
a> 2 because loops either cooled to below 1MK or had sharply peaked EM. The importance
of the energy-dependent waiting time was that a subset of the loops (those with the largest
energy release) were able to cool to near 1 MK, while many others did not. Figure 3 demonstrates
this further.
