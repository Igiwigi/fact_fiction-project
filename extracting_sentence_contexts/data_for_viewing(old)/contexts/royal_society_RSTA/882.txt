In the numerical solution of the BdG equation, equation (4.2), it is important to keep enough ky.
Figure 6 shows the calculated finite-slab spectrum for a single pair (figure 62) and two pairs
(figure 6b) of Weyl nodes. In the former case, a continuous line of zero-energy states is formed
along the kz-axis connecting the bulk Weyl node at k? to that at —k2. These Fermi arc (in this case
just a straight line) states are absent in the bulk spectrum and correspond to the surface states at


y=0 and L. In fact, a very small gap is visible due to the hybridization of the two surfaces that
are of finite distance L apart. In the latter case, the Fermi arc connects the two bulk Weyl nodes on
the positive k,-axis. (There is another arc along the negative k,-axis, which is not shown.) This is
in accordance with the topological charge of the nodes found above from the spin texture.

5. Phase diagram

The spin texture and the Fermi arc surface states presented above unambiguously established
the existence of pairs of Weyl nodes in SM periodic structures. We have systematically scanned
the parameter space of this model and the resultant phase diagram is shown in figure 7. Most
strikingly, one observes a series of lobes (light grey regions, W}) that feature single pairs of Weyl

nodes, similar to those shown in the left panel of figure 2. Approximately, each lobe appears when : 2
