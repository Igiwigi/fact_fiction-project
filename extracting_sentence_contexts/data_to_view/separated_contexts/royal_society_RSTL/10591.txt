But this maximum does nob appear in eyclic curves given by
applying and removing higher values of the load. Tts absence is, however, satisfac-
torily explainable as one of the effects of hysteresis. Tn fact, it still exists, bub
hysteresis shifts it to the lefb of the origin, &o that successive applications and
removals of pull lie on one side of it. If we could trace the effects of push as well as
pull, the presence of this maximum would be immediately detected. The diagram
below will make my meaning more clear.
