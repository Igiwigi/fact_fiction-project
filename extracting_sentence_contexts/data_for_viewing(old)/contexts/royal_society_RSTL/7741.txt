up towards the nasal bone,

Lastly, in a foetus 9 inches long, the boundary of the intermaxilla is still distinctly
marked on the under surface of the palate, extending outwards to the posterior half of
the outer wall of the lateral incisor, which it forms as far as the margin of the foramen
for the nerve, thence it extends, as a fissure occupied by the nerve for the middle incisor,
and crossing the septum between the incisors is lost in the plates of bone which have
Joined the incisor process.

The preceding observations account for the absence of all trace of the human inter-
maxillary bone on the facial aspect of the upper jaw in the adult, whilst the permanent
fissure through the palate and on the inner side of the nasal process are equally explained.
The bone, in fact, is shut, off from the face by the nasal and incisor processes of the supe-
rior maxilla. Distinetly outlined (Plate XIV. fig. 6) at the close of the fourth month, it
is joined to the superior maxilla during the latter part of the fifth or beginning of the
8ixth month ; its nasal process, as it may conveniently be termed, is buried in that of
the upper jaw, the apex assisting to form a permanent ridge for articulation with the
inferior turbinate bone. In a foetus 1:5 I notice a light cleft in the nasal process of
the superior maxilla corresponding with the top of the groove on its inner surface, but

I have never Â£een anything like an approach to the formation of a distinct anterior
plate of bone, snch as forms part of the premaxille of mammals.
