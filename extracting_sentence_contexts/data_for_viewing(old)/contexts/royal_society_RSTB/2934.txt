158 DR. W. G. RIDEWOOD ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE

every species under consideration, but in genera with gill-structure so diverse as
Nucula, Yoldia, Anomia, Mytilus, Lithodomus, Meleagrina, Ostrea, Astarte, Ano-
donta, Tellina, Mya, and Lyonsia the palps have the same essential structure.
They are imperforate flaps, generally of triangular shape, deeply corrugated on their
mutually opposed surfaces, and smooth on the sides which face the mantle and
visceral mass (see THreLe, J., “ Die Mundlappen der Lamellibranchiaten,” ‘ Zeitschr.
f. wiss. Zool. xliv, 1886, Leipzig, pp. 239-272, with two plates).

That the palps are not dismembered portions of the ctenidium is indicated not only
by the above fact that their structure remains invariable however much the gill may
become modified, but algo by the relative positions assumed in certain cases. In Lyonsia
and Nucula, for instance, the attachment of the palps to the body is at a much
lower level than the ctenidial axis, and in Mytilus, Venus, and Psammobia, the front
part of the gill lies between the inner and outer palps. The palps are supplied with
arterial blood by a branch of the anterior aorta; but even if, as has been suggested
by Mrrsuxurt (68) and Drew (22), they have a respiratory function, it does not
follow that they are on that account to be regarded as of ctenidial origin, since the
same function is ascribed to the mantle. The palps, also, are innervated from the
cerebral ganglion, whereas the gills are innervated from the visceral.

In the Nuculide the palps are exceptionally large, and are provided at their
posterior ends with an elongated muscular appendage, with close transverse plications
