The operation of the valves so as to give the blasts at the required intervals is
automatic. By means of a suitably adjusted cam mechanism connected to the main
shaft of the engine driving the compressors, a small valve is first of all opened
causing a second valve to admit the “driving air” to the driving cylinder, thus
setting the piston into vibration; the same valve also admits air into a large relay
valve, allowing the main “sounding air” to pass into the diaphone a fraction of
a second later, so that the note begins to sound only when the piston has attained
its normal frequency. In fact, the sharp commencement of the note and its sudden
termination by a rapid fall in pitch during a small fraction of a second is characteristic
of the diaphone signal and is very favourably commented on by navigators as entirely
distinct from any siren note which might be sounded from a passing ship and of
great value in determining the direction of the sound. During the tests carried out
