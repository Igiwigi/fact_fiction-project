This is very near the 0-87 grm. of carbon lost per egg in 20 days in the
“tin” nest experiment (p. 433). Tt is true that the loss of 0-8 grm. is not all due to escape of carbon; part of it
being caused by enhanced evaporation from the living eggs due to the growth of their
internal heat towards the end of incubation. A rise of 1° F. in the average temperature of the living eggs above that of the
dead eggs would account for a loss of about 0-07 grm. per egg if it occurred in the
last week of incubation; and a rise of about 2° F. has been found to occur under
hens ; but, apart from the fact that the whole calculation is approximate only, the
rise here dealt with is that of live eggs above dead eggs lying with them in the same nest—
a condition which tends to reduce temperature differences between them. When this is
