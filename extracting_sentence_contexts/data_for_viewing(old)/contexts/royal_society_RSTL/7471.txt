3r +21, or r+41, according as its roots are all real, or as it has a single pair, or two
pairs, of imaginary roots.

259, Consider any m functions (A, B, ... K) of the coefficients, (m= or <n). For
given values of (A, B, ... K), non constat that there is any corresponding equation
(that is, the corresponding values of the coefficients (6, c,...) may be of necessity ima-
ginary), but attending only to those values of (A, B, ... K) which have a corresponding
equation or corresponding equations, let it be as8umed that the equations which
correspond to a given set of yalues of (A, B, ... K) have a determinate character (one
and the same for all such equations) : this assumption is of course a condition imposed
on the form of the functions (A, B, ... K); and any functions satisfying the condition
are 8id to be © auxiliars.” It may be remarked that the 7 coefficients (6, c, ...) are
themselves auxiliars; in fact for given values of the coefficients there is only a single
equation, which equation has of course a determinate character. 'To fix the ideas we may
consider the auxiliars (A, B, ... K) as the coordinates of a point in m-dimensional space,
or 8ay In mM-SPACE.

260. Any given point in the m-space is either * facultative,” that is, we have corre-
sponding thereto an equation or equations (and if more than one equation then by what
precedes these equations have all of them the same character), or else it is © non-faculta-
tive,” that is, the point has no corresponding equation.

261. The entire system of facultative points forms a region or regions, and the entire
s7stem of non-facultative points a region or regions; and the m-space is thus divided
into facultative and non-facultative regions. 'The surface which divides the facultative
