On the abovementioned evening, at z* 40', two days and
twelve hours after the new moon, when in consequence of the
libration, the western border of the grey surface of the Mare
Crisium was 1' 20'' distant from the western limb of the moon,
the air being perfectly clear, I prepared my seven-Å¿eet reflector,
magnifying seventy-four times, in order to observe the first
clearing-up of the dark hemisphere, which was illuminated
oaly by the light of our earth, and more especially to ascertain
whether in fact this hemisphere, which, as is well known, is
always somewhat more luminous at the limb than in the
middle, would emerge out of our twilight at many parts at
once, or first only at the two cusps. Both these points ap-
peared now, most distinctly and decidedly, tapering in a very
sharp, faint, scarce any where interrupted, prolongation ; each
of them exhibiting, with the greatest precision, its farthest ex-

though immediately only at the cusps, where, but more parti-
