Proposition 5.2. The following two statements are equivalent.

(1) In a tubular neighbourhood of the parabolic orbit yo(t) = (0,0,0,g=t) there is a (real-analytic)
diffeomorphism ® such that
(i) ® preserves H and F;
(ii) *(Q) =.
(2) The functions IT, Io, 1, [1 (real-analytic in the complement of the bifurcation diagram) satisfy
the relations

2In the domain {(¢1, £2) € R? | e? > — 4¢3}, similar asymptotics for I1(H, 4) and 1(H, 4) hold, where the coefficients a, 6, &, B

are replaced by 2w,8,2d,5 for some real-analytic functions 5, in a neighbourhood of Znyp-


(i) 11(H, a) — IT(H, A) is real-analytic (in a neighbourhood of the point H =0,4 =0);
(ii) 11o(H, 4) = F1.(H, 4). In fact, the functions /7(H, 4) and /7,(H, A) are not independent. Indeed, as H > 2(—a)9/2/(3./3)
(ie. when the real disconnected regular fibre approaches the hyperbolic singular one) these two
functions have a logarithmic singularity with the same logarithmic coefficient, that is, we have
the following asymptotics:

TI(H, 4) = a(H, 4) In|3V3H — 2(—a)°?| + B(H, A),
TI.(H, 4) = a(H, 4) In |[3V3H — 2(—2)°/7| + Bo(H, A). In other words, the functions 6(H, A) and £.(H, 4) are different and not related to each other in any
sense, but the coefficients a(H, 4) are the same for both functions.
