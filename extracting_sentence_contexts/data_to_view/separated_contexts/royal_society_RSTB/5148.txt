STOMATAL FREQUENCY, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO WOODLAND FLORA. 37

also characteristic of rosette plants, whilst some plants which normally have no stomata
in the upper epidermis, possess such on the lower leaves (e.g., Mercurialis perennis), all
tend to suggest the possibility of this distribution being adaptive in character, and hence,
perhaps, we might expect to find that an increased frequency in the upper epidermis
was accompanied by a decrease in the lower, and vice versa. Examination of Scilla
nutans and Ficaria verna, however, reveal the fact that, as shown by the correlation
diagrams (figs. 10 and 11), there is a high degree of positive correlation between the
