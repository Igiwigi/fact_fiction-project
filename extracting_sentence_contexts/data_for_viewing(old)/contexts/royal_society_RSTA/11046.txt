events, the results for the final period, 1889-96, show no distinct progressive
diminution of @ or increase of b as compared to the period 1865-96. In fact, the
“all” day data for these two periods, and the “quiet” day data for the shorter
period, give almost identical values for the mean b for the year.

As regards the seasonal phenomena, each set of Greenwich data makes b con-
spicuously least, but b/a conspicuously largest, in “ winter.” The December value of
b is invariably the smallest. The “all” and “quiet” day data for 1889-96, as
already stated, give very nearly the same mean value of b for the year, but the
“quiet” days’ value for b is much the larger of the two in winter, and the smaller in
summer. The “quiet” day data at Greenwich present a remarkable similarity to
the corresponding Kew data, as is best seen by comparing the seasonal values for b/a.
The fact, however, that the absolute values of both a and b are some 10 per cent.
higher at Greenwich than at Kew is rather suggestive of some misapprehension as to
the scale values at one or both observatories.

§ 9. In cases such as the present, a comparison of calculated and observed values is
useful. The Greenwich data do not lend themselves very readily to this, as
Mr. Extis does not give mean values for individual years, and the interest attaching
to such a comparison for individual months of the year seems hardly sufficient to
justify the necessary labour. In (A), § 75, some results were given for individual
months of the year at Kew, but none for the year asa whole. This information is
accordingly now supplied in Table IV., so far as concerns the ranges and the sum of
the 24 hourly differences from the mean in the mean diurnal inequalities for the year
in the several elements. The calculated values are derived from the values given for
