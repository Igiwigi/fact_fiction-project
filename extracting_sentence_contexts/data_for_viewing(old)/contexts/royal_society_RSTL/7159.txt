55. Finally, RUnMKoRFF's large induction coil was discharged between two electrodes
of carbon, surrounded by an atmosphere of: hydrogen. 'The four groups «, 6, c, and d
were obtained, constituting the spectrum of vaporized carbon.

56. In resuming, we are struck by the variety of appearances presented by ignited
vapour of carbon when submitted to spectral analysis under different conditions. But,
whatever may be this variety, it is impossible not to admit that all or nearly all of the
various types of 8pectra we described are derived from the same source. We may
distinguish four such types: 1st, the bands, especially seen when the flame of cyanogen
is fed by air; 2ndly, the particular distribution of light and shadow near HB when the
flame of olefiant gas is fed by oxygen ; 3rdly, the large fields shaded by transversal dark
lines; 4thly, the characteristic groups of bright lines, @, b, c, d, e, f, 9g, k, which are to
be ranged into two different sets, a, 6, c, d, and e, f, g, h. Tt is a curious fact that all
these different types, either fully developed or indicated only, are represented in the
flame of cyanogen, if fed with oxygen, while in all the other cases we examined there
are represented either a single type or two types, or even three, —namely, 1, the third
type alone; 2, the first type, with the second set-of groups; 3, the third type, with one
8et, of groups (a, 6, c, d); 4, the same type, with the other set (e, g); 5, the second and
third types, with the first set of groups. There is no doubt that the different types
correspond to different degrees of temperature,—the temperature being lowest when the
bands are principally developed, lower in the case of the second set of groups than in
the case of the first, lower in the case of the shaded large fields than in the case where
the characteristic groups appear simultaneously.

In the present state of the question we are not able fully to explain the various
