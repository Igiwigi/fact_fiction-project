Jn the particular case of two quadrics (a, 6, eXzx, y), (4, V', Fw, y)*, the lineo-linear
Jpyoriant becomes the lineo-linear invariant

S ac —20 +ca.. Zr we have V=U, then the lineo-linear covariant gives the quadricovariant

E d2U.d!U—(d,2,U)? E the single quantic U (sﬆuch quadricovariant is in fact the Hessian) ; and if in the last-
"Mentioned formula we put for U the quadric («, 6, cz, y)*, or what is the same thing. Ain the expression of the lineo-linear invariant ac — 200+ ca', we put the two quadrics
qual to each other, we have the quadrinvariant

E ac—t?

Se the single quadric. Z 70.
