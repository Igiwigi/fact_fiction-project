independent of manuring and cropping, are so great on the same plot, that we have
found it quite impracticable to make calculations as to loss or gain in the total
nitrogen of the subsoils.

Upon the whole we conclude, that certainly the estimated losses of the surface
soils, and probably also the estimated gains, are higher than can possibly happen in
practice ; and that the results are due to the method of taking the samples of soil not
being such as to ensure strictly comparable estimates at the different periods. At
the same time there can be no doubt that there would be losses beyond those due to
the removal of the crops, under the conditions in which losses were found ; that is,
when the land was under arable culture. Nor can there be any doubt that there
would be gains in the surface soil when the land was laid down in sainfoin and mixed
grasses ; and M, Den√©ratn points out the practical significance of such facts.

M. Deneratn concludes that the loss of nitrogen by arable soil, that is by soil that
is mechanically worked, is due to the slow combustion of the nitrogenous organic
matter of the soil; the nitrogen being either evolved as free nitrogen, or oxidated

into nitric acid, and carried down into the subsoil, or into the drains. As to the gain
by the surface soil, he considers that part is due to the action of deep-rooted plants,
in taking up the nitric acid accumulated in the lower layers, and leaving a nitrogenous
residue near the surface; a view in which we fully concur. As to gains not so to be
