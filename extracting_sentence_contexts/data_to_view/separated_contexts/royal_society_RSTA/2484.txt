Note that flux
emergence, shearing motions and flux cancellation may occur independently or in tandem in
ARs that host major eruptive events.

b) Coronal properties

Models of CME initiation (see ยง5) presume that the pre-eruptive coronal configuration is either a
magnetic flux rope or a sheared magnetic arcade. In the latter case, the sheared arcade transitions
to a flux rope during the eruption because there is no physical process that can produce a
large-scale outward propagation without involving a flux rope. Motivated by this fact, a large
number of works investigate the pre-eruptive coronal configurations using multi-wavelength
observations. In principle, both sheared arcades and flux ropes can sustain dipped, sheared
filament channels above PILs. However, deciphering the pre-eruptive coronal structure is difficult
because routine magnetic field measurements above the photosphere are not available and
because line-of-sight confusion is inevitable when imaging optically thin plasmas.
