The extent of this
divorce is apparent in the words of Erwin Schrédinger when he considers modelling the quantum.
theory based on ordinary human experience. He writes

A completely satisfactory model of this type is not only practically inaccessible, but not
even thinkable. Or, to be precise, we can, of course, think it, but however we think it, it is


wrong; not perhaps quite as meaningless as a ‘triangular circle’, but much more so than a
‘winged lion’. [8]

The startling fact is that our ability to model Nature far outstrips our ability to conceive it;
indeed, only the most mundane aspects of Nature are intelligible, those corresponding to our
everyday experience. Formation of a scientific theory requires a mathematical conceptualization
characterizing the observations. Validation requires aligning the terms of the theory with
phenomena, making predictions from the theory, designing confirmatory experiments, and
then checking to see if the predictions are sufficiently consistent with the experimental
observations.
