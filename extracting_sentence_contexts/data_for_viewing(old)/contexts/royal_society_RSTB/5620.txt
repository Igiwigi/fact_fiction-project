The carbon balance sheets for these species are given in Table V. Unlike the species
in the separate groups so far examined, which have all behaved similarly amongst
themselves, there is a sharp difference in biochemical behaviour between the different
species of A. nidulans. This is limited to one biochemical characteristic, namely
the production of volatile neutral compounds (alcohol). Thus, while cultures Ac. 67,
78 and 85 produce considerable amounts of volatile neutral compounds and have respira-
tion coefficients of about 1-6, cultures Ac. 98, 79, 80 and 9 do not produce any alcohol.
The different cultures seem to be similar in other respects. Thus, almost all of them
give rise to considerable amounts of “carbon unaccounted for,” and this has been
shown to be almost entirely mannitol, both in the case of those species giving alcohol
and in the case of those which did not give it. (These results are given in Part IX.)
In addition, all the different strains grow well on the medium used, and none of them
gives rise to appreciable amounts of titratable acidity. In fact, three strains, Ac. 79,
Ac. 80 and Ac. 9, actually bring about a reduction in the initial acidity of the medium.
All strains give rise to amounts of volatile acids which, while small in themselves, are
large in comparison with those formed by other groups, e.g., the A. glaucus group.

Group 6.—A. versicolor-A. Sydowi group.
A number of species are included in this group. A. versicolor VurLLEMIN has proved

to be of common occurrence and a large number of different strains have been collected.
Kight strains given in Table VI are representative of the whole :—
