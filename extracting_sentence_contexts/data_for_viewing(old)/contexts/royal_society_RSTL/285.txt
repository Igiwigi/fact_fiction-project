equal to the angles which the chord b makes with the axis of
the orbit. From the angles thus found, the true anomalies
are immediately deduced: for v is equal to the difference of o
and ; and v', to the difference of g and i. Further, the time
of passing the perihelion will be between the two extreme
observations, when and 4y/ are both greater than Â© and @'
respectively: otherwise the time of passing the perihelion will
be before, or after, both the observations, according as 7, the
radius vector at the first observation is less, or greater, than 7',
the radius vector at the third observation. But these rules
suppose that the angular motion of the comet in its orbit, in
the interval between the extreme observations, is less than
1802; which, in fact, will comprehend all the cases that can
occur in applying the method.

The true anomalies of 7 and 7, being known, the perihelion
distance, denoted by D, will be fond by either of these for-
mulas, viz.

D =r cos." =
D 44-0908; =

To find the time of passing the perihelion, we must take
the times corresponding to v and v' from a table of the motion
in a parabola; these times, being multiplied by D#, will give
