I repeat it again, if I had but ſuſpeted ſo many
ſingularities, what I now can give only by way
of conjecture, might have become demonſtra-
ble in fa&t, It is ſcarce probable that I ſhall ever
have ſuch another opportunity ; but it is more ſo,
that it may offer to ſome one among the great num-
ber of the literati in Europe, who read the Philo-
ſophical Tranſa&tions. This was the principal mo-
tive that determined me to preſent this obſervation,
though imperfe&t, to the Royal Society, Why
ſhould we heſitate to make a publick acknowledge-
went of our faults, when our brethren may profit by,
and amend, them ? Another motive, which engaged me to offer this
obſervation, ſuch as it is, was, that even the im-
perfeQion of it does not affect the uſeful conſe-
quences deducible from it : for, whatſoever may
have been the diſpoſition of the blood-yeſſels of this
monſter, it is a fact abſolutely certain, that it had no
heart, nor any other vi/cus in the place of it ; and that
the circulation of the fluids, which appears to have
taken place from the exiſtence of the principal ar-
teries and veins, could not have had any other moving
power than the circulation of the mother itſelf. Hence
this child, monſtrous as it is, demonſtrates the cir-
culation of the blood from the mother to the fetus,
and from the fetus to the mother again z which
ſome moderns deny, and others endeavour, at leaſt,
to render doubtful, I preſented to the Academy at
Rouen ſome years ago, ſeveral obſervations which fa-
voured the antient {yſtem; the preſent comes to their
ſupport, to give this excellent hypotheſis of Harvey
all the credit it deſerves,

The

The child I ſpeak of had no mouth, eſophagus,
nor ſiomach, thus it could not, by that uſual paſſage,
be nouriſhed from the waters that ſurrounded it;
it could not abſorb from the ſurrounding fluid where-
with to/ fill its veſſels, and ſupply its growth. It,
therefore, - follows that it received both its arterial
and alimentary fluids from the mother by the umbi-
lical cord, and that it owed eyery thing to that cir-
culation, which ſome would attempt to annihilate.
