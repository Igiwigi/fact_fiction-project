vacuum, that the repulsive action only came on by still further pushing the exhaustion,

and that, as I further exhausted, the repulsion got stronger, it was of interest to see
what would take place in a vacuum 80 nearly perfect that it would not carry a current
from a RunMKoRey's coil,


516 MR. W. CROOKES ON ATTRACTION AND

In small tubes, and taking certain special precautions, T could prepare a yacuum with
my Sprengel pump which would hardly allow an induction-current to traverse it, or would
only show a faint, cloud-like discharge ; but it was impossible to effect this in the large
tubes required for these experiments, and, in fact, all the Sprengel vacuum balance-

tubes which I had hitherto prepared became brightly luminous
when the current from an induction-coil was passed through
them. I accordingly fitted up the apparatus shown in figure 5,

in which a chemical vacuum could be prepared by a method
first devised by Dr. AxDREws (Philosophical Magazine, February
1852).

terminals ; at 6 two platinum wires are passed through, to con-
nect with an induction-coil; at Â« the tube is contracted to allow
