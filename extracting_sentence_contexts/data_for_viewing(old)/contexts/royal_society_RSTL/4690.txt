will denote a symmetrical function of the roots, whose value, in terms of a,, a, ..0z, can
always be determined when @(z;) is a rational function of ax;, and can very often be
determined when @(z;) is an irrational function of a; Thus the value of the sum Eg(w),
where the different values of x are the roots of an algebraic equation, can often be found
when the yalues of the separate terms of which that swm is composed cannot be found.

Now this suggests to us the question whether it is not possible in certain cases to find
the value of the integral-sum E&ſXdw, where we cannot find the value of the separate
integrals involved in that «um. What we uſually mean by finding the value of the
single integral [Xdz, is the expressing of the value of that integral in terms of its superior
limit, an arbitrary constant being annexed, and consists, in fact, in determining the
function @(s;) in the equation

where @;, 2, ..z, are the roots of an algebraic equation, which we will suppose to be (1).

Representing (4.) by =("X4z, the solution of the problem will, according to the nature

of the analysis employed, assume one of the two following equivalent forms, viz. either
