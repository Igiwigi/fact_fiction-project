where (- - -) denotes the average amplitude value of spectral components over the frequency range
from 0 up to 20fy. This frequency range captures practically all frequency components of self-
mixing signals in the study. The cross-correlation coefficient Cs depending on the amplitude Ay
of current modulation, calculated with the use of expression (3.1), as shown in figure 10f.

In the bistability domain, the coefficient Cs can reach the value Cs ~ 0.93 for some value of Ay.
This fact testifies to a high degree of similarity between the spectrum So (considered as an input
spectrum) and the output spectrum Sj. For the case studied, the optimal value of Ay for G and
Cs are achieved for the injection current jg, corresponding to a maximal value of Gyr of the tenth
harmonic of fy.

Cs = (3.1)

4. Conclusion

Thus, the presented results indicate that vibration resonance can be used as an efficient method to
control all-optical polarization switching in bistable lasers in the development of optical switching
devices for communication systems. An experimental realization of the method was given in a
bistable VCSEL with a rather slow response time; however, the use of another type of bistability
