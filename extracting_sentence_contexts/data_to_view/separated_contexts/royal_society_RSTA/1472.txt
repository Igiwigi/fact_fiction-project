The ultimate goal of the EQSIM development is
to remove computational limitations as a barrier to scientific exploration and understanding of
earthquake phenomenology, as well as to practical earthquake hazard and risk assessments. Traditional earthquake hazard and risk assessments for critical facilities have relied on
empirically based approaches that use historical earthquake ground motions from many different
locations to estimate future earthquake ground motions at a specific site of interest. Given the
fact that ground motions for a particular site are strongly influenced by the physics of the
specific earthquake processes including the fault rupture mechanics, seismic wave propagation
through a heterogeneous medium and site response at the location of a particular facility,
earthquake ground motions are very complex with significant spatial variation in both frequency
content and amplitude. The homogenization of many disparate records in traditional empirically
based ground motion estimates cannot fully capture the complex site-specificity of ground
motion. Over the past decade, interest in using advanced simulations to characterize earthquake
ground motions and infrastructure response has accelerated significantly.
