There are many people who are against the idea of extending the DNA database because
of the potential threat it has to citizens’ privacy [35] and the risk of data abuse is potentially high. But that is not our principal concern here. In fact in 2012, the UK Protection of Freedoms Bill aimed
to redress the balance between the state’s duty to protect the public and an individual’s right to
privacy. As a consequence 1766000 DNA profiles taken from innocent adults and children were
deleted from the database. The problem we raise here is that if you have a close relative in the database, then you may be
identifiable from that profile.
