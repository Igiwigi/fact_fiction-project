relation between them (designated by s), viz. this is the equation 0=0 obtained by
adding the several syzygies, multiplied each by the proper numerical factor as shown

there are here 10 composite covyariants, but only 5 irreducible coyariants ; there should
therefore be 10—5, =5 syzygies; we have in fact the 6 derived syzygies

designated by 6E'; these must therefore be connected by 1 identical relation (desig-
nated by o), viz. this is the equation 0=0 obtained by adding the several syzygies,
each multiplied by the proper numerical factor as shown Table No. 89.

345. These two cases (-) are in fact the instances which present themselyes where a
correction is required to my original theory. The two identical relations in question
were disregarded in my original theory, and this accordingly gave the two non-existent.
irreducible covariants (a, ..(a, y)'* and (a, ..Y(v, y)”. And reverting to No. 336, these
give in the denominator of A(z) the factors (1—*a®)(L—d*s"'). In virtue hereof,
