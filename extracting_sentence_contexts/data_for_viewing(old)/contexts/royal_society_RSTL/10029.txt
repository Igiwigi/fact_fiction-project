of those processes, then it, is possible to conceive it as acting in direct opposition to
such an influence as the vagus nerve which I have supposed to act by expediting those
game formative processes ; were this the whole of its action, however, it ought to prove
as local in its effects as muscarin or curare. Since, however, atropin removes the whole
action of the vagus nerve upon the ventricle when it has been applied to the sinus and
aurieles only, the question naturally arises, how is this to be explained ? Is there a
trophic centre for the ventricle which is situated either in the auricles or venous sinus,
upon which both atropin and the vagus act? At present I do not see any absolute
necessity to draw such a conclusion from this action of atropin, and therefore prefer to
leave this question entirely undecided in the hope that further researches may enable
me to come to some definite conclusion upon the matter.

In conclusion, I desire again to call attention to the fact that the action of the vagus
upon the muscular tissue of the heart is characterised by two different sets of effects.

1. Diminution of contraction force asgociated with a diminution in the excitability
and a diminution of the tonicity of the cardiac muscle.

2, Increase of contraction force associated with an increase in the excitability and
possibly also with an increase in the tonicity of the cardiac musele.

Upon the view put forth above that a series of 8ubstances are formed between the
muscle protoplasm and the final explosive substance, it follows that the chemical
combinations which are formed in the lower part of this series possess less explosive
