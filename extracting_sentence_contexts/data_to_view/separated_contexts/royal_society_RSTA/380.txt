The fact that g(A) is of the form (cubic in A)/(quadratic in A) for several particular forms
of F and G has been noted; the point of the above analysis is that it shows that the form of

g(A) as a function of A has nothing to do with the form of f as a function of 7. A detailed
examination of the steps by which (4-5) is derived shows that it arises quite naturally from

the assumption that fis a linear function of A. The numerator of g(A) arises from # x dU,/dx,
and so necessarily involves A3 and the denominator from # and involves A?; thus it can be
seen that if f were assumed to be polynomial of the nth degree (an n-tic) in A, then g(A)
would be of the form
