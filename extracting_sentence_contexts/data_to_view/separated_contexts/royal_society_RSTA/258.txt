2. Science as a way of knowing

The widespread misapprehension that ‘science’ is essentially always about
unambiguously factual answers is both understandable and unfortunate. It is understandable because the science taught in primary and secondary
school, and in much of tertiary education as well, deals with topics we really
understand very fully. It makes for sensible curricula and easily-marked exam
papers.
