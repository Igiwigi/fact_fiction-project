* The improvement in the polonium due to treatment with potassium cyanide at a red heat was 80
marked, that it does not seem possible to explain it by the greater concentration of the material when in
the metallic condition. The observation is of some interest, and I hope to investigate the matter further ;
but it bears only indirectly on the subject of the present paper.


510 HON. R. J. STRUTT ON THE CONDUCTIVITY

Uranium, as well as radium, gives off two types of radiation, one much more
penetrating than the other. (See Rurserrorp, ‘Phil. Mag., January, 1899.)
BecquerEt has shown (‘Comptes Rendus,’ vol. 130, p. 1583) that some at least of
the uranium rays are deflected by the magnet, but he does not seem to have made
any experiments to decide whether both types are so, or only ‘one. In fact, the
radiation is so feeble as to make such experiments very difficult. But it seems
probable that, as in the case of radium, the penetrating type of rays are deflected,
while the others are not so.

My experiments were exclusively concerned with the rays from the bare compound,
which consist for the most part of the easily absorbed type. Only a small fraction of
the total conductivity is due to the other kind, so small, in fact, as to make any
determination of the conductivities difficult, unless some more powerful preparation
than mine were available. The experiments were accordingly confined to the easily
absorbed type of radiation.
