ables and groups considered and methods employed. Cranial
length (GOL) differs the most among paleodemes of H. erectus
(figure 2c), and its signal does not appear to be as influenced by
the duration encompassed by the paleodeme as some other
variables. On the other hand, Pan data show less absolute vari-
ation in this dimension (data not reported here). This result is
consistent, then, with Spoor et al. [38] finding that H. erectus
with the introduction of the KNM-ER 42700 calvaria showed
more variation than Pan. However, whether this indicates
increased dimorphism in H. erectus as they argued or increased
variability /plasticity, as we might be inclined to argue, is
unknowable at this time. This interpretation is likely also con-
founded by the fact that GOL is affected by the degree of
development of both the supraorbital and occipital tori,
species-specific features of H. erectus whose expression may
differ across the sexes [60]. Despite our data for GOL variation
across paleodemes, we concur with Plavcan [64] that little vari-
ation in CV is apparent between human and non-human data
generally, and this seems to hold when comparing across more
localized populations of extant primates as we did here, as well
as across fossil paleodemes. As argued above based on our cur-
rent data, we are unconvinced that this lack of difference in CVs
is informative with respect to variability. But it may argue for
lower dimorphism in H. erectus, as has been earlier argued
by McHenry and others [125,126].
