maintains expression post-development in many small species,
but only very rarely in larger species.

We are not the first to suggest that fitness trade-offs might
have played a key role in shaping the evolution of telomere
dynamics. For example, Stone ef al. [35] noted that while
short telomeres protect humans from cancer, they could
account at least in part for the relatively high rate of heart dis-
ease. Also, Gorbunova et al. [16,36] have extensively studied
the inverse association between telomerase activity and body
mass in rodents, highlighting the fact that telomerase suppres-
sion might have evolved as a tumour suppressor mechanism in
larger species. The novelty in our model rests in the formal inte-
gration of the trade-offs of TL (cancer versus senescence) into a
fitness model that also takes into account the variability in mor-
tality and cancer risk due to body size. By taking advantage of
the fact that tumour suppressor mechanisms can be integrated
into the Armitageâ€”Doll equation of cancer risk, we offer a
simple mathematical solution that tailors cancer risk by TL.
The equations we develop here allow us to model fitness
