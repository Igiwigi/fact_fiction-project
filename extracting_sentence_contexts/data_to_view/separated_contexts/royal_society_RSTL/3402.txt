With the ordinary metallic salts it yields precipitates, which are,
when dried, of a reddish brown colour. The constitution of these salts is perfectly
definite, and hence by means of them the composition of the amarythrine may be com-
pletely ascertained. The truly definite nature of the salts of amarythrine is fully
shown by the fact, that the precipitate which first forms when a solution of nitrate of
lead is precipitated by amarythrine, and the second portion which is produced when
the acid supernatant liquor is nentralized by ammonia, were found to possess precisely
the same composition. The amarythrate of lead was analysed as follows :

A. 0-491 of the precipitate formed by amarythrine in a solution of nitrate of lead, the
liquor being acid, gave

0-208 of oxide of lead, and 0-015 of metallic lead.

0:565 of the same substance gave 0-569 of carbonic acid, and 0151 of water. B. 0970 of the precipitate produced by neutralizing the acid liquor of A. gave 0963 of

carbonic acid, and 0'238 of water.
1122 of the same substance gave 0237 of oxide of lead, and 0260 of metallic lead.
