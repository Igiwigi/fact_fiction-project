Be larger ones; in which I found that the results were in great measnre due to the
Mfluence exerted by the saline or other constituents of the yelk, which were carried into
The vesicle by osmose. Thus, in larger eggs of group 3 and smaller ones of group 2,
Frhen long acted on by water, the germinal spots of contained vesicles are seen to get
pale and disappear; at the same time the ovisac and yelk-sac show evidences of
abundant endosmose, and there is also some granular deposit in the cortical layer of the
yelk, but not such as will account for the obscuration of the 8pots, as the position of the
germinal vesicle is well seen, marked by a clear area (Plate XV. figs. 13 & 14). Still
later on, the contents of the germinal vesicle are scen as distinct granules in rapid tremor.
These facts strongly suggest the notion that the germinal spots are soluble in some of
the constituents of the yelk, and we may thus explain their disappearance in ripe ova.
It should be here mentioned that free germinal vesicles, being uninjured, remain in
water for hours, without much visible distention or displacement of their contents, or dis-
appearance of the germinal spots; and the same may be said of those contained in very
