226 Dr. THoMsoN on some of

VII. Chromiron Ore.

In my © First Principles of Chemistry,” vol. ii. p. 55, I
express an opinion, that this mineral is a compound of 2
atoms brown oxide of chromium and 1 atom peroxide of
iron. The facts stated in this Paper, showing that this opi-
nion was ill founded, it hecame necessary to endeavour to
determine the compoxsition of the mineral by experiment,

The following table exhibits the result of all the analyses
of this mineral that have come to my knowledge.

Green oxide of chrome

Peroxide of iron - *- 24*33

Alumina = - = = 11*76| 17:80
Silica - - = = = 1'06| 229
