produce the balancing forces which he required. If two ridges only can form in such
a way that the distance between them has a fixed value which is re-established if the
ridges are disturbed in any way, Kornta’s theory must be fundamentally unable to
explain ridge formation, for the only way in which a repulsion can explain two isolated
ridges is hy the dust particles being driven apart into two groups, the distance
increasing until the repulsive force is too feeble to overcome frictional forces. If this
were the mechanism, the distance between the two ridges would not be either sharp
or stable as it actually is, nor would the ridges themselves be sharp. It is also
impossible to explain on this theory another fact of observation, namely, that if a group
of two or three ridges is formed with a high intensity of vibration, and the intensity
then be diminished, the distance between the ridges diminishes.

To establish beyond question the inadequacy of Kornia’s theory, and to throw
further light on the mechanism of ridge formation, experiments were carried out with
small light spheres, about 2 mm. in diameter. They were prepared from pith by
cutting with a sharp razor by hand. A number of these spheres form good ridges in
vibrating air, as shown in fig. 25, Plate 23, the spheres not only forming up in lines normal
to the axis of the tube, but mounting upon one another in walls two or three spheres high.

A single row of spheres was then cemented to the wall of the tube in a line normal
to the axis and extending over a sector subtending an angle of about 80° at the centre
