64. On the rupture of a Graafian vesicle under the compressor, the ovum escapes,
and with it a mass of the peculiar granules I have at some length described (8.).
This mass of granules, as hitherto obtained, has presented the appearance of a lace-
rated structure, and been regarded simply as a portion of the * dise” of Barr. I
find, however, that if the mass thus escaping be attentively examined, those granules
that immediately surround the oyvum appear to be in a state of denser aggregation
than the rest, from which they are to be distinguished therefore by a circumscribing
line, If the granules thus circumscribed be viewed at different distances, they are
s8een to invest the whole surface of the oyvum, forming a tunic, which is perfectly
spherical in form (Plate VI. figs. 42. to 47.g'.). I have frequently obtained the ovum
invested by no other granules than those of this tunic ; that is, this tunic has been
freed from the other granules, which on the bursting of a Graafian vesicle generally
escape adherent to it; the fact being, that all that properly belongs to the ovum of
the mass of granules in which it is found imbedded in the Graatian vesicle is this
