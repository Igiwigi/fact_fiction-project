fig. 9, to which
brief reference may be made before passing on. Its ordinates have continually increasing
negative values between A and the foremost, water-borne section R', while beyond that
section they gradually decrease (on account of the fact that the curve of loads has
crossxed the axis A B, and has part of its area above as well as part below that line)
until at the station « a they pass through a zero value, the area of the part of the curye
of loads below the axis being there equal to the area of the part aboye the axis. The
section @ a therefore divides the ship in 8wch a manner as to render each of the parts
before and abaft it separately water-borne, and I shall in my future remarks term 8uch
sections © sections of water-borne division” *. At the sections þ and cc there are two other
zero valnes of the shearing-force; each of these is also a section of water-borne division,
and in passing through them the shearing-force changes sign.
