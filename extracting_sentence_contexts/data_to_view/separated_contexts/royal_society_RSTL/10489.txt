Intimately allied to the chert is the yellowish-gray porous rock which frequently
forms an exterior crusb to the chert, but sometimes also forms independent beds. The rock is principally of chalcedonic silica, with which very frequently calcite is
intermingled. The main difference between this rock and chert consists in its porous
nature, arising from the fact that the spicules in it are but as empty casts, and the
silica of these spicules has probably been deposited in the adjoining bands of chert. There can scarcely be room for doubting that the beds and irregular masses of chert,
which are found nearly everywhere in the strata of the lower and upper greensand in
connexion with the detached spicules of sponges, have been derived from the silica of
these sponge-remains; and from the same source has also originated the silica which,
in many of the deposits, more particularly in the Blackdown Hills, has replaced the
shells and tests of the mollusca and other calcareous organisms. The theory has,
however, been advocated that the silica of chert has been derived rather as a direct
deposit of this mineral from 8olution in sea-water, than as the product of the decom-
position of the siliceous structure of sponges.
