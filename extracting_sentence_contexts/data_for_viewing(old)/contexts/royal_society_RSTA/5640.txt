data-informed moment methods that use low-order moments to learn specific high-order ones
[50-52]. Extension from [46] includes non-uniform and long-time pressure forcings, making the
trained model appropriate for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers.

We emphasize that incorporating a trained neural network into a numerical method comes
with its constraints. The neural networks train on a finite set of pressure profiles thought
appropriate for a class of physical problems. However, one cannot ensure that this fully
generalizes, something which must be verified. Here, pressure profiles are sampled from a
distribution that can represent many practical bubbly flow problems. Yet, the method is not
guaranteed to generalize well for drastically different external forcings. The former caution stems
also from the fact the used neural network is trained on a fixed time step, which may result in
poor generalization for cases with much faster dynamics.

Section 2 formulates a model problem that serves as the basis for the proposed extension
of CHyQMOM, namely the dynamics of a population of cavitating bubbles whose statistics
are significantly non-Gaussian. In ยง3, the new hybrid method is described. Section 4 shows
that this approach can improve low-order moment predictions while extrapolating out of the
moment space to compute required high-order moment predictions. This section also investigates
the utility of additional quadrature points whose locations are selected by the recurrent neural
networks (RNN). It also compares the computational costs of the present approach and the
classical CHyQMOM. Section 5 summarizes our conclusion.
