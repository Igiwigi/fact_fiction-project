components. Similarly, it is thus expected that reproductives manipulation in a termite of lower social complexity, Crypto-
and non-reproductives in social species should age at different termes secundus, shows that constant temperatures are more

rates, as is clearly documented in many social insects [7-10]. detrimental than variable temperatures for both queens and


workers. This is demonstrated by reduced fitness and
increased mortality and faster rates of ageing in both castes
[32]. Additionally, transcriptome analyses reveal a clear
oxidative stress defence signal (including Prx3) under con-
stant conditions, which is stronger in workers than queens.
These at first sight unexpected results can be explained by
the fact that workers of this species are totipotent immatures,
which have not yet reached maturity [32].

By stressing honeybee workers by an infection with a
virus and treatment with the oxidative stressor paraquat,
Kennedy ef al. [33] reveal that reproductive workers are
better protected against stress than non-reproducing workers.
The transcriptome analyses show that both reproductive acti-
vation and paraquat-induced stress result in an upregulation
of genes from, e.g., JH pathways (including vitellogenin) as
well as antioxidant genes. This supports the view that repro-
duction per se activates mechanisms that lead to increased
longevity in the honeybee. This is similar to what has been
