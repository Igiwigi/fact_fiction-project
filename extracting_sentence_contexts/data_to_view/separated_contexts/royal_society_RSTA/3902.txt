Such a possibility has already been explored by using specialized
computational infrastructure made of thousands of GPUs [55]. Importantly, the LBMD computational scheme offers an original approach to multiscale
simulations. In fact, the multi-resolution lattice Boltzmann scheme is today available [56], as much
as devising methods where the particle resolution is handled differently in different regions of the
system [57-59] and, in essence, allowing to handle situations where both the fluid and particle
components cross the scale boundaries. Data accessibility. The files containing the processed Protein Databank structures relative to CI2, amyloid
peptides and the A2 domain of VWF and containing the OPEP force field parameters are publicly available
upon request to the authors.
