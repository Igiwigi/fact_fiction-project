However, through recognition of the cortical microcircuit structure and topology,
it is possible to further optimize performance. For example, while the sPyNNaker software
package can handle a generic SNN model with multiple projections between populations, the
cortical microcircuit model has only a single receiving projection between each population. This
information is used to simplify code handling address look-up, acknowledging the fact that :8
only a single address will be returned, and removing multiple loops and conditional statements [S
accordingly. Overall these updates enable a single spike targeting a single neuron to be processed :3
in 3.55 1s, a 31% reduction relative to previously published results [12]. It is useful to contrast =
this number with the spike processing window, which effectively begins when neurons start : ‚Äù
sending spike packets, and ends when the second timer event is triggered, giving it range: : =
3.73 8 < ts,proc < 90 Ls. a
