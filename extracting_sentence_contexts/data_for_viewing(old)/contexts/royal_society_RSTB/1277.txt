as Gorse has already pointed out (Joc. cit., p. 698) the tapetum of Selaginella

phases, and recognize the periclinal divisions discussed in the preceding paragral
the distinction of the two types appears to be not so deep a one as he described

er facts of differentiation of the sporangia, as mega- and micro-sporangia,

tiation of the megaspore-mother-cell from the rest ; this is shown in fig. 91,
undergone tetrad-division, and beginning to enlarge, while the other cells
gporogenous mass remain undivided, lose their highly refractive contents, and
. disorganized. It is hardly necessary to remark that here is a further
ple of a partial sterilization of the potential sporogenous tissue, and the tapetum
elaginella is also another, since, though it is derived by segmentation from the

a mass, its cells take no direct part in the formation of spores.
