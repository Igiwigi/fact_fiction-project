It cannot be revived; and is covered by a slimy fluid which appears as if it were
that of the peritoneal cavity exuded. In the adult state in this worm the system of
the blood-proper js highly developed ; a circumstance which explains the diminished
proportion of the chylaqueous fluid. That the basis of this latter fluid consists of
water, I infer from the immediate importance of moisture to life, The fact of its
exixtence, and next that of its physiological importance, are quite proved by the

resu]ts of observation on the young Earth-worm (fig. 23). In the early stage of
development the peritoneal fluid in this worm is, relatively, considerable in quantity. In the infancy of this Annelid it fulfils those functions which during adalt life are
discharged by the true-blood.
