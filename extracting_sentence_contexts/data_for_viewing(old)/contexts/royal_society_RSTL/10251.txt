Sdivided into two parts. It appeared to us not improbable that embryology might
Sthrow some light on the history of this gill, and accordingly we kept a look out in
our embryos for traces of gills on the hyoid and mandibular arches. The results we
Zhave arrived at are purely negative, but are not the less urprising for this fact. The
hyomandibular cleft as shown above, is never fully developed, and early undergoes a
complete atrophy—a fact which is, on the whole, againsb MULLER's view ; but what
astonished us most in connexion with the gill in question is that we have been unable to
find any trace of it even in the oldest larva whose head we have had (26 millims.), and

at a period when the gills on the hinder arches have reached their full development.
We imagined the gill in question to be the remnant of a gill fully formed in extinct
Ganoid types, and therefore expected to find it better developed in the larva than in
the adult. That the contrary is the fact appears to us fairly certain, although we

cannot ab present offer any explanation of it.
