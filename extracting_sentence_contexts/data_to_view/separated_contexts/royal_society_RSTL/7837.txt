At the foremost of these the shearing-force is, for the © Belle-

-ophon' 50 tons, and for the © Audacious' 96 tons; while at the aftermost the shearing-
Force is 200 and 168 tons respectively. These figures show that the concentration of

eights amidships, in ships with central batteries and armour belts, while it renders

Yhe conditions of strain more complicated, reduces the actual shearing-strains far below

ose experienced by completely protected ships. There is doubtless a great reserve of
trength in all ships against shearing-strains, 80 that this fact has not much practical

Aveight ; but, as I shall show hereafter, the severer bending-strains are similarly reduced
when the weights are concentrated, and this is a much more important feature. The BexviNG MOMENTS Tesulting from the action of the vertical forces on a ship
floating in still water next claim attention. I have already indicated the method by
which these moments may be estimated when the distribution of the weight and buoy-
ancy are known, and will therefore proceed at once to the graphical method of record-
ing them.
