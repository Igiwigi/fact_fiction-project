Taking all the usual precautions numerous determinations of the R.P. were now made ;
in any one series the observed rate of decay in the amplitude of the vibrations was,
with very few exceptions, almost perfectly uniform, and even in the exceptional cases,
the deviations from uniformity were so small as to become negligible. The conclusion
was therefore drawn that this device amply fulfils the functions for which it was
designed. The success which attended the introduction of the enveloping cylinders is primarily
attributed to the fact that the fluctuations in the temperature of the air within an
ordinary balance case are so extremely small; so minute are they that all ordinary
attempts to discover their existence must necessarily end in failure. We desire to
emphasise the importance of this fact: for we believe that in the presence of
abnormally large fluctuations, measures even more stringent than those adopted here
might be required for maintaining perfect uniformity in the temperature of the air
within the cylinders. It is only by preventing a// fluctuations in the temperature ot
the air immediately surrounding the pans and stirrups that we can hope to completely
suppress disturbing air streams.
