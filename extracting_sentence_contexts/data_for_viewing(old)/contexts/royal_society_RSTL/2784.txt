MADE ON THE COASTS OF EUROPE AND AMERICA IN JUNE 1835, 303

arrives along the coast of the Netherlands predominant at another period. The short,
series of observations which we have now before us, does not by any means enable us
to determine how far this change in the influence of the two tide-waves is constant.
and regular. On the coast of the Netherlands, also, this inequality seems to offer a
peculiarity ; for it vanishes on the 24th, but increases again without missing a tide.
In the northern part of Norway it increases from the 12th, vanishes on the 20th, and
exists but irregularly afterwards.

The evidence of these 8tatements is 8een most clearly by an inspection of the curves
of which I have spoken ; and the eye catches from these the course of the facts far
more distinctly than from any numbers. But it is not necessary to publish all these
curves, and I have therefore only annexed a specimen in Plate XXVIL. and, for the
rest, stated the results of them in numbers in Table XI. The means there given are
obtained by a graphical interpolation, 8uch as I have already described, and the
other columns exhibit the effects which are mainly due to the diurnal inequality.

26. In these tables the differences of heights are arranged according as the tide oc-
Ccurs A.M. or P.M. But it will be seen at once that this is not, in fact, the circumstance
on which the distinction depends; for at most of the places the p.y. tides are greatest
till about the 12th, then the a.v. tides are the greatest till the 18th, and afterwards
the e.. tides are again the highest. Hence we see that it is impossible to give the
law of this inequality, as is sometimes attempted, by saying that at one season of the
