We tested, therefore, recovered nocturnes (Table, Tissue Reactions, VI. B). These
showed, like nocturnes themselves, acidity of liver and muscle-tissues. This, together
with the fact that no periodic change of reactions appears in the skin, seems to show
that the intermittently secreted acid-substance has nothing to do with the movements
of the pigments in the chromatophores of the skin; although it is noteworthy that
nocturnal colour-change begins in the liver, then affects the muscle, and finally the
skin. Ifthen this strange rhythm of secretions is in any way connected with the
rhythm of pigment movement, it must be by acting, not upon the chromatophore-
centres, but upon the diffuse blue-pigment after its discharge from the chromatophore-
centres. When we turn to the genus Macromysis, eg., M. nigra or M. flexuosa (see
Section VI.), we find that the alternation of alkaline and acid phases of liver-tissue
coincides most closely with that of the diurnal and nocturnal colour-state of the
animal,

Thus of eight J. negra diurnes, seven are alkaline as to liver ; of five caught at the
same time, but exposed on porcelain dishes, until they assumed the nocturnal
appearance, all show acid livers.
