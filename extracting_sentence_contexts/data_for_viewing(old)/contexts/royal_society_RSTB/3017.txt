round,

Test experiments were performed in the same way as the above with an elm
18 metres high, the selected levels from which the leaves were taken being
250 centims. and 1350 centims. above ground. This difference of level in water is
equivalent to a head of an atmosphere, and, with the normal rate of flow, a difference
of pressure of from 4 to 8 atmospheres would be required according to previous
calculations for this portion of the stem. The lowest concentration required to
produce incipient plasmolysis in any leaf-cell was noted in each case, #.e,, the lowest
concentration at each level. The maximal difference observed was equivalent to
3 per cent. of grape-sugar (18 and 15 per cent.), but the usual ditference was below
2 per cent. (24 atmospheres), Although these values are not as high as would be
required by Dixon and Joryâ€™s theory, the fact that they do exist, and appear to be
fairly permanent, is of considerable interest, even although they may be in the first
instance merely due to the more rapid assimilation in the more exposed leaves at the
higher level. The plant itself, however, can vary the osmotic concentration of the
sap in case of need, and can, if necessary, produce the required concentration in
a non-assimilating cell as well as in an assimilating one.

As far as these observations go, however, they do appear to indicate that, although
the leaves may exert suctions approaching 1 or 2 atmospheres, actions go on in
the trunk itself which raise the water upwards, and maintain it in a mobile condition,
ready to flow to any region where even a small suction is exercised upon it. Full
and satisfactory proof will, however, only be obtained by observations made upon
trees of 50 or more metres height, and having healthy leaves near their bases as well
