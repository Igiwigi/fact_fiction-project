glass partially exhausted of air. We are therefore not to regard flame as a con-
ductor of electricity in the ordinary sense of the term ; when the only part it
performs in the conduction is merely that of forming a partial vacuum.

This fact is sometimes illustrated in a magnificent manner during violent
irruptions of volcanic mountains. The air in the crater is highly rarified : and
during a thunder-storm, the lightning is observed to dart into the hollow
cone as if it were attracted by the flame, or by the mass of melted lava at the
bottom of the crater; whereas the true cause of the phaxnomenon. is found in the
ready passage which the partial vacuum affords to the electric fluid driven off
by its own repulsion from the charged cloud.

It is a well-known fact that imperfect conductors become tolerably good
conductors when heated. Glass, for example, which is a very imperfect con-
ductor when cold, conducts the electric fluid very readily when heated red hot.
This is indeed what we might naturally expect from what we have assigned
as the cause of conduction. Glass when cold has a powerful attraction for the
electric fluid; it is therefore natural to expect that when charged with caloric,
which is at least one of the ingredients of electricity, its attraction for that
fluid would become less, and consequently afford a freer passage for the current
along its surface. If the body be naturally a pretty good conductor of elec-
tricity, the ratio of its conducting power will not be 80 much increased by
heat as in the case of a less perfect conductor. 'This at least was found by
Marianini to be the case with fluid conductors; and from some experiments
