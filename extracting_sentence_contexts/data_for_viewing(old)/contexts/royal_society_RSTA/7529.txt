proportion of types C and D increases and type D ultimately becomes the most frequent
type of complex field-change at the greatest distances to which these observations
extend. There are some other differences of detail between the behaviour of the double
and the more complex field-changes; for example, for distant discharges type C is
comparatively common among the double field-changes but is rare among the more
complex ones.

290 T. W. WORMELL ON THE EFFECTS OF THUNDERSTORMS AND

One of the most striking facts which emerge is that when a complex field-change
accompanies a flash within 3 km. the first perceptible effect is in 80% of cases a
negative change of field. If simple field-changes are included, the proportion of all
observed field-changes due to discharges within 3 km. in which the first detected
change is negative is just over 60°%,. At slightly greater distances, on the other hand,
the proportion of cases with a negative first process is much smaller. The detailed study
of the lightning discharge by Schonland ¢¢ al. (1935) showed that the first detectable
effect was, in South African storms, nearly always a comparatively slowly moving leader
streamer travelling downwards from a negative charge in the base of the cloud. An
identification of the initial negative change for very close discharges with a leader of
this type, which should cause a negative change of field when the storm is overhead
but a positive change at all points outside its comparatively small reversal distance, is
immediately suggested. If the identification is correct, it is rather surprising that the
