at a comparatively recent period. Pebbles of quartz, trap, and limestone were of frequent
occurrence, especially in the Flint-knife Gallery and in the West Chamber. Nodules of
iron-ore, well rounded, as if by travel, were occasionally met with in both the principal
galleries. Dr. Percy pronounced them all to be specimens of the brown or hydrous
hematite. Fragments of stalagmite, apparently portions of an old floor, were also
found in this bed in the Wes: Chamber, the western part of the Flint-knife Gallery,
and in the Steep Slide Hole—portions of the cavern in which it does not appear that
a floor of this kind ever existed. Some of them measured as much as 18 inches square,
and from 3 to 4 inches thick, At least a cartload of this material must haye been
found.

Ordinarily the third bed measured from 2 to 4 feet thick, the variations being due
partly to inequalities in the surface of the deposit next below, and partly to the fact
that the latter was invariably from 4 to 9 inches lower at the sides than in the middle
of the galleries.

Besides the inequalities just alluded to, there were two of a more marked character:

thus at about 15 feet south of the north entrance, and adjacent to the west wall of the
Reindeer Gallery, the *bone-bed” occupied a funnel-shaped pipe (c) 5 feet deep, 12 and
4 inches in diameter at its upper and lower ends respectively, and penetrating vertically
downwards into the bed below; and in the West Chamber the loam filled in the inferior
