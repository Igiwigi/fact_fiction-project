A portance at present is the fact that he believes these yascular bundles to spring from his
inner or medullary rings of vessels, and not from any part of the outer or ligneous zone,
and that he discovers 20 traces of cellular medullary rays in his specimen.

M. BRroxGNIARr, as we have seen, found a yery similar general arrangement in his
Sigillaria elegans, only in this plant the inner or medullary vascular cylinder was inter-
rupted, at intervals, instead of being a continuous ring. He also found a profusion of
what he unhesitatingly affirms to be medullary rays; but the tissues which composed
them being destroyed, he cannot speak with confidence as to their histological character.
Besides these he found traces of larger openings in the woody cylinder ; and he correctly
surmises that these were passages through which the large foliar yascular bundles, seen
