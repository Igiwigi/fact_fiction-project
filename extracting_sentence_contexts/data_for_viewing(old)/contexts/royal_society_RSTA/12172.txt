i.e. of the absolute rotation in the ether, will be set in action in the surroundin
medium. If the metals are perfect conductors the effective flow of displacement will
be confined to the surface, and will involve simply a vortex-sheet along the surface
each metal; but if the conducting power is imperfect the disturbance will dif s
itself into the metals, and the final steady condition will be one in which it j
uniformly distributed throughout them, forming an ordinary electric current obeyir
Ounâ€™s law.

68. On the present theory, high specific inductive power in a substance is equi
valent to low electric elasticity of the ether; it in fact stands to reason that
elastic medium whose continuity is broken by the inelastic and mobile portions whic
represent the cores of vortex-atoms may from this cause alone have its effective
elasticity very considerably diminished.

Moreover it has been ascertained that, in electrolytic liquids, the specific inductiy
capacity attains very great values; the wether in these media interposes a pro
portionally small resistance to rotation, and the mobility or some other property 6
the vortex-molecules in it has brought it so much the nearer to instability ; it is thu
the easier to see why such media break down under comparatively slight electri
stress. Such a medium also frees itself, as described below, from electric stres
without elastic rupture, in a time short compared with ordinary standards, but i
most instances long compared with the periods of light-vibrations ; while in metalli
