Hence xy = 148.

is that the decreased ionization consequent on increased pressure may be more than
compensated by the increased ionization consequent on increased temperature, so that
on balance the temperature of maximum may be decreased and not increased, as
observed. Mathematical analysis confirms Miss PAYNE’s conjecture. We have in fact
an interesting application of the solution to ScuwarzscutLp’s problem. The temperature of maximum is determined by the equation Py) = [ K,], where
6 varies only slowly with T,,,,. and K, varies principally through its exponential factor
containing T,,,.. What we actually observe is not, however, Tax, but (Ty)max., Where

(Tinax.)* = 3 (Trimax. (1 + 3 7);

and 7 is related to Py by an equation already given.
