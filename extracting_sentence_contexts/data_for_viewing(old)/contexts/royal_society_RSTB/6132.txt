The hyoid muscles of the Pelobatide are essentially like those of generalized Lepto-
dactylide and Ranide. The geniohyoid, in particular, has lost the more primitive
relations characteristic of the Discoglosside, and has acquired the typical Anuran
condition. There are usually three posterior petrohyoid muscles (two in Pelodytes,
see R1pEWOOD, 1897, b), the last of which may be attached in part to the cricoid. If
the position of the first two on the ventral side of the thyroid membrane in Megalophrys
robusta is characteristic of the family, this provides a small point of contrast with all
other Anura, except Alytes and Discoglossus.

The most characteristic feature of the larynx is the incompleteness mid-dorsally of
the cricoid ring. This might have been considered a primitive feature, in view of the
fact that the cricoid is known: to develop from a pair of distinct cartilages (MARTENS,
1897), but the cricoid is incomplete dorsally in Rhacophorus (Polypedates) dennyst,
(FRazrer, 1924), which also, curiously enough, has the hyalia represented by anterior
processes alone. This is regarded as an instance of convergence, but throws doubt
on the primitiveness of the condition in the Pelobatide.

In Pelobates (fide Hente and Biume) and in Megalophrys (Leptobrachium) hasseltw
(fide Bepparp) there are no cesophageal processes; in other species of Megalophrys
there are two parallel processes.

The constrictor musculature of the larynx in Megalophrys robusta is exactly similar
to the most generalized type in Leptodactylide, Ranidw and Hylide. The specialization
of the dilatator laryngis recalls, on the other hand, some of the more specialized Ranid
