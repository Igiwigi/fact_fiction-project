In Caprella linearis (Lamodipodes, Cuv.), it is an easy process to observe the blood-
cells circulating in the branchial appendages depending from the inferior surface of
the body. They occur under three discernible varieties :â€”1st, simple, non-granular,
non-nucleated, pellucid, spherical globules (fig. 56) ; 2nd, more or less orbicular
bodies, of which the bright nuclens is prominent visible, and a mass of slightly
refractive molecules; 3rd, the fact, characteristic of all blood-cells falling under the
denomination of the articulate type, of the apparent suppression of the cell-capsule. In this species the blood-corpuscles are large relatively to the proportions of the
body. On bursting in the field their contents fibrillate in a very obvious manner.
