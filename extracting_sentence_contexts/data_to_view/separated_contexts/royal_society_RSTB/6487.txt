The normal length is about 9 cm. The dozen specimens before me are preserved
dorso-ventrally flattened or in profile in almost equal numbers. This arrangement may
depend more on the fact that both the dorsal and ventral fin spines are very long
than on the real shape of the body of the fish, but when taken in conjunction with other
evidence derived from the shoulder girdle it goes to show that the height and width of
the fish at the shoulder were about equal, and that the animal possessed a flattened
ventral surface. It is clear that the fish was rather abruptly truncated in front, the snout being
rounded from side to side and probably somewhat wedge-shaped dorso-ventrally ; the
exact profile is, however, impossible to determine. When allowance is made for the
widening due to crushing the fish is comparatively slender and stream-lined, though
the caudal pedicel is deep.
