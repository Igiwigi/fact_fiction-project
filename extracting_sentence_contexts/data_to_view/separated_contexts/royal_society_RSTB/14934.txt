Padi3{3 transcription is initiated downstream of
the first exon of Padi3a, and the Padi38 mRNA begins with the intronic region (green box) being combined with a part of the second Padi3ar exon (large white
box). (6) PADI3c and PADI36 differ in their N-terminal domain (PAD_N), whereas the middle (PAD_M) and C-terminal (PAD_C) domain are identical. Calcium
binding sites (*), required for enzymatic activity are intact in both PADI3 isoforms. Three-dimensional models (Q9Z184 for PADI3a. and E9QAM4 for PADI3B) gen-
erated using AlphaFold prediction [36,37] show the difference in the N-terminal truncation in PADI3B (highlighted in green) compared with PADI3c (highlighted in
purple). (c) The amino acid sequences of the unique portion of each PADI3 isoform, colour coding corresponds to the structure highlighted in (a,b). (d) Illustration of
FACS strategy using a Krt74:H2B-GFP mouse at P2 to mark all epithelial cells (interfollicular epidermis and hair follicle). SCA1 expression is used to discern hair
follicle epithelium (SCA1-negative) from interfollicular epidermis (SCA1-positive). Two hair follicle cell populations (GFP-+, SCA1-) are FACS isolated based on ITGo.6
(integrin-c16) expression.
