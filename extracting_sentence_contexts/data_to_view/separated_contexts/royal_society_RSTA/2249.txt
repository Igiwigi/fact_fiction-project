Here, there is enormous confusion, as exemplified by the well-known measurement
problem. Alas, ‘measurement’ is another term often used in quantum foundations without a
clear meaning, so of necessity any discussion of how it relates to contextuality must be based
on some understanding of, if not solution to, the measurement problem. In fact, there are (at
least) two measurement problems. The first, widely discussed, problem is how to think about
the macroscopic outcome of a measurement, traditionally referred to as a pointer position, since
unitary time evolution often results in a quantum superposition (Schrédinger cat) of possible
measurement outcomes. The second, less discussed but equally important, is how to infer from
the macroscopic outcome the earlier microscopic property that the apparatus was designed to
measure.
