If we are justified in attaching any significance to these dimensions, then it ought to
be possible to link them up with the reversible transformation which exists between
the «- and 6-forms. Assuming that the density of stretched hair is not very different
from that of unstretched hair, then the volumes of the two pseudo-cells should be the
same. As a matter of fact, if the spot of spacing 4-65 A.U. which we have chosen as
(200) of the $-form be taken, instead, as (400), this relation is indeed roughly true ; for
