For the Mk II apparatus, new test masses were made, and the
source masses were cut down to 115mm in height. Calculations of their individual gravitational
fields assuming they were spherical differ by about 10% from a calculation treating them as
cylinders. Although it was not necessary to make the four source masses and the four test masses
of exactly the same size, in fact they were quite close in dimension and in mass. The masses in the
Mk II were about 1.2 and 11.2kg, respectively, for each of the test and source masses, similar to
MkI. A critical parameter in all measurements of G is the uniformity of density of the attracting
masses.
