This I have done in my present inquiry, and find the absorption of the
above gases to be under 0-1 per cent., which in the case of oxygen is less than 74gth,
and in the cage of hydrogen less than 745th of the effect obtained by Professor Macxus
with a tube less than half the length of mine. Making every allowance for the differ-
ence between our two sources of heat, the discrepancy between us is still enormous. In
fact my conclusion is that these gases are practical yacua to radiant heat, and that the
mixture of oxygen and nitrogen which constitutes the body of our atmosphere is the
same. While, however, in the case of the elementary gases the discrepancy between Professor
MaGxus and myself consists in a defect on my part, or an excess on his, with the
powerful gases I obtained a considerably stronger action than he does. 'Thus with
olefiant gas his absorption amounts to less than 54 per cent., whereas in mine it amounts
to more than 72. This last result is what might only be expected, inasmuch as the
length of gas traversed by the radiant heat was in the one case a little under 15 inches,
and in the other 353.
