Thus in the Elasmobranchs the venous and lymphatic systems are still morpho-

logically one, though the veins, or rather some of them, may sometimes carry blood
and sometimes carry lymph. It is therefore not unreasonable to suppose that as the
two systems became morphologically distinct, the great thyroid expansion of the
inferior jugular vein of the Elasmobranchs became separated into a system of true
veins permeating the stroma of the gland, and possibly mainly nutrient in function,
and a lymph sinus specially related to the evacuation of the secretions of the thyroid
epithelium. The first beginnings of differentiation seem, in fact, to be already taking place in this
group of fishes, for in connection with the venous sinus that envelops the thyroid body,
Ferauson (5, p. 183) describes a plexus of vessels to which he assigns the character of
fully differentiated lymphatics, and into some of which he traced the entry of secretion
from the cavity of neighbouring thyroid vesicles. What is apparently an early stage in a similar process of differentiation has been
observed by ALLEN (2) in the cartilaginous Ganoid Polyodon. In this genus the ventral
aorta and its branches are enveloped by a large, irregular, sinus-like expansion of the
inferior jugular ; but this sinus is not purely venous in character, for there open into
it, not only veins, but vessels derived from the lymphatics of the gill arches, containing
a fluid poor in red corpuscles, and evidently to be classed rather as lymphatics than
as veins.
