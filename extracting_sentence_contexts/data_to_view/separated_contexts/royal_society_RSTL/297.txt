With the same latitude of interpretation may be understood
muriate of potash or of soda in the scale of equivalents; and
the relative weights of mere potash or soda may, perhaps, be
determined better by means of these compounds than by any
other, because they are not liable to be superacid, and are not
decomposed by heat. If to a quantity of muriatic acid, which, by previous trial, I
know would dissolve 100 carbonate of lime, I add 100 grains
of crystallized carbonate of potash, and after the addition find
that it will dissolve only 49,8 of carbonate of lime; I hence
infer that 100 of this carbonate is equivalent to go,2 carbo-
nate of lime, and consequently that 125.5 is the equivalent to
63 in the table. Next, if I combine 125,5 of crystallized carbonate of potash
with an excess of muriatic acid, and evaporate to dryness, I
expel the whole of the water with all redundant acid, and
I find 93,2 of neutral salt; and whether I call it muriate of
potash, or chlorid of potassium, or by any other name, with
any other views, I may. deduct g4,1 as dry muriatic acid,
(whether real or imaginary®) and infer the equivalent for pot-
ash to be 59,1, even though there Should, in fact, be only 49,1
of potassium present, requiring 10+ of oxygen to convert it
into potash.

* Its separate existence is certainly imaginary, for it can no more be obtained un-
combined than dry sulphuric acid, or dry nitric acid.

+ Tf all the steps in the series, by which the number 49,1 is inferred, be correct,

this should be exactly 10,00 without any fraction ; and the proportion assigned to

muriate of potash by Berzerr1vs is sufficiently near, to shew that there can be no
considerable error, 83,02 ;' 16,58 :; 49,1: 10,04,

The next question' that occtirs relates to the composition
of this..crystallized carbonate of potash, which T am induced”
to call bi-carbonate of potash, for the purpose of marking
more decidedly the distinction between this salt and that
which is commonly called a snbcarbonate,* and in order to
refer at once to the double dose of carbonic acid contained in
it. With reference to carbonate of lime also, I must neces-
sarily consider it as a' supercarbonate, for if I add a s6lution
of this salt to a nentral solution of muriate of lime, a consi-
derable effervescence takes place, from a redundance of car-
bonic acid beyond what is necessary to' saturate the lime. If
I saturate 12,5 of this salt with nitric acid, taking due pre-
cautions not to expel any of the fluid along with the gas which
escapes, it loses about zz of carbonic acid, which is the double
of 27,5.
