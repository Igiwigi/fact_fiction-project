Tt is (in Mr. SHEEPSHANKS' opinion) an adyantage that they are
Wade of a pure metal. References to the determinations of the length of the pendulum
may be rejected at once, not only because they are inaccurate, but also because they are
fact expressed in terms of SHUCKBURGH'S scale, and not in terms of the Parliamentary
Ktandard. Mr. SyEEPSHANKsS considers therefore that our materials for restoration are
Senerally unsound; and that with our endeavours to give the best evidence in our power
& to the past, we must combine, what is now more important, the discussion of methods
Fr avoiding similar difficulties for the future.
