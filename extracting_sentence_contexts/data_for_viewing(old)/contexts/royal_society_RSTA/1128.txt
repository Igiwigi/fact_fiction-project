guaranteeing the existence of unique solutions to these equations. There are a number of possible
answers, some of which I hope are more convincing to those naturally sceptical about such things
than the vague reply that it is unsatisfying not to have a rigorous proof.

— Lack of uniqueness would mean a lack of predictive power, so uniqueness of solutions
is crucial for a ‘good model’. However, it is also of interest to have a way to check that
a particular solution is unique, even in the absence of a general uniqueness result, and
there are ways to do this (see §§5b and 6).

— Without an existence result, what do numerical calculations approximate? Put more
abstractly, how can one prove the convergence of a numerical scheme without being able
to guarantee the existence of an underlying solution towards which to converge? (This
is, in fact, possible under the assumption that a sufficiently smooth solution does exist, see
Chernyshenko et al. [8].)

— One could hope that a better mathematical understanding of the equations will lead to
an enhanced physical understanding of the phenomena they model. (It is probably more
reasonable to expect that a better mathematical understanding will require an enhanced
physical understanding.)

— Some very natural quantitative bounds on solutions are lacking, e.g. how to estimate the
maximum value of the velocity in the future given the initial velocity profile. (In fact,
bounds of this sort would be sufficient to solve the regularity problem, see §6.)

— Theoretical methods to treat this problem should also apply to other PDE models. This
