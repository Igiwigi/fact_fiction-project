Figure 2. Geometry of the hybrid analytical-CM—GFPE model for simulating sound propagation from an elevated sound source,
positioned at a ridge (radius Ra, source height z,), towards a valley (radius Ry, receiver heights z,). Z; and Z, are the ground
impedances of the ridge and valley parts, respectively. (Online version in colour.)

the source. In the current context with a source at a large height, a major part of the valley would
be artificially put in an acoustic shadow zone (figure 1b), leading to inaccurate results. Although
applying a higher-order source approximation could extend the cone with correct predictions [17],
at the source side of the valley this problem would still remain.

The solution to this problem is found in the fact that the GFPE method is able to commence
from any vertical array of pressures that can be accurately calculated at sub-wavelength spacing.
There are actually three possibilities. Most commonly used is a Gaussian starter [17] as the
first column of pressures, representing a monopole source. Accuracy up to larger propagation
angles can be achieved by a higher-order approach of the latter [17]. Secondly, another full-wave
technique can be used to produce a starting field at close distance from the source [21,29]. A third


option, as done in this work, uses the analytical solution for coherent line source diffraction
around an impedance cylinder (with circular cross-section), with the line source parallel to the
cylinder axis (summarized in appendix A).

As a result, the current hybrid analytical-CM-GFPE model does not suffer from angle
