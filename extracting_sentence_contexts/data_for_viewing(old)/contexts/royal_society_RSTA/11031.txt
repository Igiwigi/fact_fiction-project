tions, and to take as operation Dj, or in general Dj,2,.. The resulting lattices will
all be magic squares in which the diagonal property is not essential, and the result of
the operation upon the function will give the enumerating number.

Art. 7. To resume; in the lattice compartments we find invariably the numbers

These conditions do not define the lattices in question, because other lattices
comply with them, viz, those in which, the whole assemblages of compartment
numbers remaining unchanged, the column partitions, while satisfying the condition
