This condition, which has been long
known to exist in the common Mole, and also in the Proteus anguineus, and which
has also been discovered in the Amblyopsis spelceus, a fish inhabiting the waters of
the Great Cave of Kentucky, has recently been detected in a considerable number of
species of Insects discovered in the very caverns of the Tyrol whose waters afford a
habitat to the Proteus. It may be supposed that the non-development of eyes in all
these animals is a part of their original constitution, and is to be looked upon as an
example of the adaptation of their organisms to the peculiar conditions of their exist-
ence; and such a view cannot at present be positively disproved. But the actual de-
pendence of the nutrition of the visual organs, or (at least) of the nervous apparatus
which forms the essential part of them, upon the continued agency of light, appears
from the well-known fact, that if, by the complete opacity of the cornea, light is
entirely prevented from entering the eye, the retina and the optic nerve become
atrophied, and in time altogether lose their characteristic structure ; thus clearly in-
dicating the direct influence of light in keeping up those nutritive actions, by which
the integrity of that structure is normally maintained. That Electricity, also, has an important influence on the operations concerned in
the development and maintenance of organized structures, can scarcely be doubted by
any one who duly considers the proofs of the disturbance of the electric equilibrium
in those parts of vegetable as well as animal bodies which are in a state of greatest
functional activity, afforded by the observations and experiments of Prof. MaTrEuccr
and others.
