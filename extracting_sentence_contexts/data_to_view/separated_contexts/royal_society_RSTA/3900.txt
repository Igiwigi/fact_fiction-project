The separation of the o crystals will cause the
residual liquid to be richer in B, that is, to be represented by a point on the liquidus
a little to the right of x, and as more and more solid is formed, the point defining the
residual liquid will travel more and more to the right. But such liquids will not be
in equilibrium with the crystals first formed, and hence if sufficient time is allowed in
the cooling, a continuous re-solution or transformation of the solid phase will go on,
while at the same time it grows in amount, Finally, when the temperature q is
reached, defined by the intersection of the vertical through x with the solidus, the
system will, in the ideal case of perfect equilibrium adjustments, be a uniform
crystalline solid solution, the crystals being surrounded by a vanishingly small amount
of mother-liquid of the composition p, where p is defined as the intersection with the
liquidus of the horizontal through g. Of course, in a real experiment, for which
infinitely slow cooling is not possible, there will be a chance that the earlier crystals
may never be wholly transformed, but may remain as cores richer in A than the solid
outside them. In this case the temperature of complete solidification will be lower
than the theoretical one given by the point g.

The fact, taught us by the phase-rule, that in a binary mixture in which only
concentration and temperature are variable a particular liquid can in general only be
in equilibrium with one solid phase makes it certain that the solidus as defined above
is theoretically the same curve as the melting-point curve. We can now proceed to consider the special form taken by the solidus in the
copper-tin alloys. As determined by us through the study of chilled alloys, and
drawn in Plate 11, the solidus consists of the broken line AblemdefE,E,H’H’K’.
