where we used the fact that the point p=0 should be passed by the integration contour from
below, see [19] for more details.

The typical strain profiles are shown in figure 5a; these solutions are admissible in the sense
that the critical strain is passed only once. To find the velocity distribution u(y), we need to solve
the equation v(7) = —V du(n)/dn, which in the Fourier space reads
