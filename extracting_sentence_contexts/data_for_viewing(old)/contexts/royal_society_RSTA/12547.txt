Hence we may write

(@ + 008 £)' = "Ecos (né + a) [Aula (7) + BoHy (0)

But it is clear that the left-hand member may be developed in cosines of multiples
of &, and, therefore, a, = 0.
Hence

Now, when « = ©, the right-hand member vanishes. In fact, since
i cos n€ cos’ €d& = 0,
when ”, 7 are positive integers and r < 1, it is clear that the highest power occurring

on the right when the expression is developed in descending powers of #, is a~"*!.
Hence A, = 0. To find B,, put « = 1,
