, the magnetic term increases from grazing incidence to a maximum value and

2b then decreases to normal incidence. ‘Ss This result is in partial agreement with the third experiment, since it was found

3 that the magnetic effect attained a maximum value when 7 was equal to about 60°; = but it disagrees, owing to the fact that the intensity depends on the square of the
2 magnetic force, and is, therefore, unaffected when the current is reversed. g In the fourth experiment, the incident light was polarized perpendicularly to the
= plane of incidence, so that A = 0; and we see from (47) and (48) that the effects
= are of the same kind as when the incident light is polarized in the plane of incidence. £ = This result altogether disagrees with the fourth experiment.
