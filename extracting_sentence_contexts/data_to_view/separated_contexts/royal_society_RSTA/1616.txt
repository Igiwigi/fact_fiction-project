We conclude that 0 < 71(8) <r. Also we have that

®(y(s)) € Q) for each s € [s},[. In fact by the definition of $ and, by (/2), for each s € [s1,$[, ®(y(s))
cannot be in Q4, Q2 and hence in Q3. The result now follows. a

(d) Main results

Our next goal consists in the investigation of the dynamical properties associated with a map
which can be expressed as a composition of maps of the form like Y and @ in the theorems
above. As a preliminary example, we consider a planar map F of the form

F:=@ow,
Our first result gives a conclusion in the line of Poincaré—Birkhoff fixed-point theorem.
