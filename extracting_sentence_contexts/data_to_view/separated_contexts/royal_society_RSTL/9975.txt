It is unfortunate that we have had no specimens showing the ribs at an earlier
stage of development ; but it appears hardly open to doubt that the ribs are originally
continuous with the hemal processes, and that the indications of a separation between‚Äù
those two parts ab this stage are not due to a secondary fusion, but to a commencing
segmentation. It further appears, as MULLER, GEGENBAUR and others have stated, that the ribs
and hwemal processes of the tail are serially homologous struetures ; but that the:
view maintained by Gore in his very valuable memoirs on the Vertebrate skeleton is
also correct to the effect that the hamal arches of the tail are homologous throughout the i
