Notable were the extreme devastation of the port facilities : =

at Lhok Nga, near Banda Aceh, where the freighter Andalas was capsized at her moorings and a Sy
90 m coal barge was deposited on the beach [22]. Also destroyed was Banda Acehâ€™s principal port : 2
facility at Ulee Lheue where a large area of the working water front suffered co-seismic subsidence aed
and large-scale scour and erosion by over washing tsunami flow depths of approximately 10m 22
[22]. Remarkably neither a pile supported ferry wharf nor mooring dolphins for a power barge at : Ss
Ulee Lheue were significantly damaged by the tsunami [18] despite the fact that the barge itself DNS
was deposited 4 km inland in a residential area. Fritz et al. [23] deduced tsunami flow speeds of : =
2-4ms"! at inland sites by using particle tracking and image processing of videos shot in the 2S

streets of Banda Aceh, several kilometres from the shoreline. Sheth et al. [24] reported that no major ports in mainland India were significantly damaged.
