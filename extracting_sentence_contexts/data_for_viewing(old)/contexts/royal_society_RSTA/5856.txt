initially be matter (i.e. Ricci) dominated and that the converse would be true at a cosmological
future.

In keeping with the quiescent cosmology concept and the WCH, a classical cosmological model
describing our own Universe should possess an initial singularity which is similar to the one in the
isotropic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) models. The geometric definition of an Isotropic
Singularity was introduced by Goode & Wainwright [8], and generalized a considerable amount
of previous work on initial singularities as well as providing a beautiful formalization of quiescent
cosmology, at least for the initial state of our Universe. We now refer to it as the Isotropic Past
Singularity (IPS).

To complete the formalization of the quiescent cosmology concept and the WCH, it is also
necessary to encode possible final states of our Universe, which should accommodate the fact
that the local degree of clumping of matter, and therefore the local anisotropy, in the Universe
must increase if the cosmological future is to be a high entropy state. H6hn & Scott [9,10] have
devised such complementary conformal frameworks, to represent final states of the Universe,
which are independent of models, coordinates and the equation of state of the source of the
gravitational field. These geometric definitions are called an Anisotropic Future Singularity (AFS),


corresponding to a recollapsing Universe, and an Anisotropic Future Endless Universe (AFEU),
corresponding to an ever-expanding Universe.

In recent years, there has been significant interest in the zoo of possible cosmological
events, including ‘Big Bangs’, ‘Big Crunches’, ‘Big Rips’, ‘Sudden Singularities’, ‘Bounces’
