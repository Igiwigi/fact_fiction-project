Lemma 8. [/-#' has a point in each of the regions [ Ay, Ey, D,], (By, E>, Ky, My) and (Ay, Ey, Ny, Ly),
thenL’ must have a point either in [Ay, E, By] or in [B,, 1]; the latter case arises only in cases Ill and IV.

In the proof, without explicit mention, use will be made of the fact that for R of type I,
¥' has no point in any of the regions [A,, H,] or [B,, £]. It will then suffice in the proof to
refer to figure 6 only, the relevant parts of which are reproduced here.
