The failure of the Hankel function to represent physical conditions by producing non-
finite jerks is particularly inconvenient when we attempt to obtain a picture of ,W%. The additional power of 1/x in the second terms of (9-30) and (9:31) would make them in-
significant for x large (as postulated), but for the fact that at the instant 7 = 0 the factors
7'~!, 7} give infinities while the other terms in 7”, 7! are zero. We shall interpret this as in
figure 10, the 7’~!, 7~! terms contributing slight but sharp jerks at the instant 7 = 0, but
otherwise the shape of the pulse being determined by the 7”, 7! factors. Thus IV, the vertical
displacement, should appear as a brief oscillation modified by a slight jerk at the instant
t= x/a,+ HI6,a,+ (H—h-+-z)?/2(xa, Hf,2,), this jerk decreasing in relative importance
with increasing distance from the epicentre.
