water,/after- which, the solution being examined by the re-
agents which had been employed in the former experiments,
was found to produce similar effects, excepting some diffe-
rence in the colour of the precipitates.

I next added some of the liquid to a solution of isinglass,
and obtained 'a copious precipitate. Thus it is evident, that
a tanning substance may be formed from animal as well as
from vegetable and mineral coal; and it is not a little curious,
that this enables us to assert as a matter of fact, although not
of economy, that one portion of the skin of an animal may be
employed to convert the other into leather.

In the course of these experiments, I also subjected coak to
the action of nitric acid, and obtained a product which re-
sembled that which had been afforded by pit-coal ; but in this
cage (as might be expected) there was not any appearance of
the deep yellow substance which has so often been men-
tioned.

These experiments therefore prove, that a tanning substance
may be artificially formed by exposing carbon to the action of
