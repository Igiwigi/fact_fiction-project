Figure 4. Mean annual volume of ice gained or lost through thermodynamic processes associated with our collection of models
between 1993 and 2010. The incremental differences from the reference run REF volume for each process are shown in the second
plot; e.g. positive melt terms indicate increased ice volume due to decreased melting, relative to REF. Note the differing scales
in the two plots. (Online version in colour.)

period. The differences in the mean total sea ice volume (SIV) across all simulations occur in a
transient period of up to 5 years from 1990 to 1994 (not shown). Three simulations stand out
in figure 4, NOLMUSHY, LAT_MELT and SST_TIME. Relative to REF, NOLMUSHY shows an
overall increase in congelation growth (+3750 km®) and a reduction in surface melt (—900 km?)
and lateral melt (—200 km’), compensated by a decrease in frazil ice formation (—3100 km)
and an increase in snow ice formation (+850 km) and bottom melt (+950 km’). The increase
in lateral melt in LAT_MELT (—2500 km‘) is largely compensated by a reduction in bottom melt
(+2200 km’) reflecting the fact that the heat available in the ML to melt the ice from below is
divided between lateral and bottom melt. In SST_TIME, a large increase in frazil ice formation is
compensated by less congelation growth and increased bottom melt. These compensating effects
are examples of the negative feedback processes that take place during the thermodynamic cycle
of sea ice.

Decomposing the total ice melt shows that bottom melt accounts for more than two-thirds of
the total ice melt, top melt accounts for almost a third of the total and lateral melt contributes less
than 10%. Looking at the ice melt across individual months (not shown) shows that a significant


fraction of the total bottom melt occurs outside the summer melt season (from September to
April), featuring monthly ice melt volumes of —2000 to —5000 km3. Over the same monthly time
