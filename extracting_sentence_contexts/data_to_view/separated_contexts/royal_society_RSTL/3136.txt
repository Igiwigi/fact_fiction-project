To determine the respectivestates of accumulative change in the bodies,
I employed the electrometer just described, and examined them, either by their in-
ductive influence on an area of equal magnitude, or by simply opposing the removed
slices to the suspended plate m, fig. 1. at a constant distance, or by other methods not
necessary to dwell on here. I obtained in this way some interesting results in re-
spect of the relative quantities of electricity displaced at given distances, which will
be noticed in another place (32.). If we place at the extremity b, of the cylinder N, three or more consecutive insulated
8lices, insulating them on glass rods, in any convenient way as in fig. 4., and then
proceed to examine the electrical state of these slices whilst under the influence of
the charged body, the electricity of the distant extremity d, will frequently be found
extending up to the last section þ; and, contrary perhaps to what we might expect,
the point to which the electricity of the distant extremity d extends toward b, will be
greater as the intensity of M is greater and its distance from N less, as if the displaced
electricity not being enabled to pass freely off in the direction b d, supposing M posi-
tively charged, was continually, as it were, bounding back or reverberating upon the
extremity b, a fact which may be further observed in the following experiment. Exp. 8. Oppose a cylindrical conductor D, fig. 5., about three feet in length and
four inches in diameter, to an electrified cylinder C, charged with positive electricity.
