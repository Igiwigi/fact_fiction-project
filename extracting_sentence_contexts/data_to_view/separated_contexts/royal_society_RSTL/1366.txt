button gave'a fine damask surface, we were disposed to attri-
bute the appearance to the presence of titanium ; but in this
we were 'mistaken; the fact was, we had unintentionally
made wootz. The button, by analysis, gave a little silex and
alumine, but not an atom of titanium ; menachanite, in a par-
ticular tate of preparation, was used : this might possibly
contain the‚Äù earths or their basis, or they may have formed
a part of the crucible. M. BerTHiER, who first made the alloy of steel and chro-
mium,*'speaks very favourably of it, We have made only
two experiments.
