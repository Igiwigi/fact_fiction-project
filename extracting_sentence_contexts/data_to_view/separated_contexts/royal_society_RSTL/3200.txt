The absence of the
membrane am, at certain parts has been already mentioned (par. 192.), in reference
to this figure as well as others. One object of the open spaces thus occasioned, may
possibly be to admit of certain parts of the germ or embryo continuing in more imme-
diate communication with the exterior than would haye been the case had a membrane
intervened (par. 190.); and coincident with the existence of those spaces is the fact, that
the vesicles forming the peripheral portion of the germ do not make their appearance
there in the same quantity as elsewhere,—while the accumulation of those vesicles at
the parts oyer which the membrane am. does extend, presents the band or arch in
question.—The peripheral portion of the germ (including the band or arch just men-
tioned), as already stated, is continuous with the subsequently yascular lamina of the
umbilical vesicle. In later stages, as the central portion of the germ advances in its
$ize, the arch in question seems to undergo a change in its sitnation, and to hecome
relatively very small (par.
