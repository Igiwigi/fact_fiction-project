AND THE CAUSE OF THEIR [IRIDESCENT COLOURS. 19

length at grazing incidence is in fact appreciably shorter than it was at normal
incidence.

Sections of these scales have been cut, and there can be no doubt that the
periodic structure should give a change of colour similar to that of the preceding
insects. It can only be supposed that certain additional factors complicate the case.
In â€œM. menelaus, indeed, the surface layer of blue scales must give colours due to
diffraction as well as interference (see Plate 1, fig. 1a), and, in the lower scales of
this and similar insects, the strips of chitin, which form the periodic structure, would,
at oblique incidence, act as a grating, superposing diffraction effects upon those due
to interference.*

The preceding measurements leave no doubt that there are two types of vridescent
