Taz fact pointed out in my report ©* On the Chemical Nature of Alloys” *, that their
physical properties may in this respect be divided into two classes, namely (1) those
which do not indicate their chemical nature, and (2) those which do indicate their
chemical nature, has led me to investigate the property of expansion by heat, s0 as to
find the law which regulates the expansion of alloys, as well as to determine to which
of the above classes this property belongs.

To do this, it was first necessary to determine the coefficients of expansion of the
metals to be employed in making the alloys; and in carrying out this research, it had
to be borne in mind that bars of a sufficient length to determine the linear coefficients
of expansion with accuracy would require very large quantities of the pure metals
to'make the alloys, in fact such quantities as it would be impracticable to prepare. A
method had therefore to be devised by which the expansion of small quantities of the
metals and their alloys could be determined, and at once one suggested itself, namely,
that of weighing the metal or alloy in water of different temperatures. This method
has been already employed for the determination of the coefficient of expansion of water
by HAirerroM and HAGEN,

To check the method (basing the calculations on Koer's coefficients of expansion tor
water), the expansion of mercury was determined. The coefficient deduced did not,
however, agree with RE6xauLT's, as was expected, but, on the contrary, differed con-
8iderably; showing either an error in the method employed, or that either Koey's or
Recxavin's coefficients are faulty. After carefully considering the method employed
and obtaining always the same results, it then became necessary to redetermine the
