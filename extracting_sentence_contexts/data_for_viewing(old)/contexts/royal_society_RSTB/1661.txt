derselben homolog. Und mithin ist tiberhaupt der sogenannte Atlas der Amphibien
in Wirklichkeit der Proatlas derselben.” ALBRECHT has consequently arrived at a
right conclusion, although one of bis premises is wrong, namely the supposed non- ”
existence of the suboccipital nerve in Amphibia.

Axsrecut thought, moreover, that he had found remnants of the proatlas in the
Amniota, in the shape of the free dorsal piece on the top of the atlas of Crocodiles,
of Hatteria and even of Erinaceus. He called this paired, or unpaired piece, the
eparcuale proatlantis. A little consideration shows that this piece is the neural spine
(eparcualia in Briuu’s and ALerecu?’s nomenclature) of the atlas itself, not of the
proatlas, which latter we know to have joined the cranium. It is surprising that not
one of ALBRECHT’s school has seen this fallacy, all the more because ALBRECHT had
laid stress upon the fact that the whole neurapophysis consists originally of a
hypareuale (my basidorsal proper) and of an eparcuale (my supradorsal), while, in
addition to these, there occur spinal epiphyses even in Reptiles (cf Lit. No. 9).

If the piece in question were the eparcuale of the proatlas, the atlas itself would
be devoid of its eparcuale. Proper dissection of the N. suboccipitalis in Crocodiles
shows that it issues and is distributed in front of the atlas and its top-piece.
Axvsrecut himself had begged the question by looking upon the imperfect facets of
attachment of the dorsal piece to the atlas as those of a zygapophysial joint.

In Hatteria the two pieces of the “ proatlas” “articulate upon the skull” (Howes,
Lit. 62), but to consider this connexion a primitive feature with any bearing upon the
morphological value of these pieces, is a conception which might: almost endanger the
