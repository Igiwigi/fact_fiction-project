Magnetic meridian, £7707 to the ine of eight points or radius.”

TrirDLY; Capt. FLinDERs's experience 'in the Investigator
showed that the maximum of error in the same compass,
would be different in different parts of the world, although
the use of the compass was confined to one particular spot in
the ship, and every precaution taken to avoid an interference
with the distribution of the $hip's iron.

It is worthy of remark, that by multiplying observations
and by comparing the series one with another, he was thus
practically led to trace a connection between the amount of
the errors and the dip of the needle; a knowledge of the fact ,
preceding, in his mind, any theoretic suggestion that such
might be the case.

It does not appear indeed that the principal cause of this
connection was even subsequently known to him; he per-
ceived that. the influence of local attraction on the compass
needle increased as the dip became greater, He endeavoured
to account for this circumstance, on a supposition that all iron
