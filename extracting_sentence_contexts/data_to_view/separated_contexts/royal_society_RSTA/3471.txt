§ 3. The Effect of Impurities. One of the most remarkable facts connected with the action under consideration is
the large effect on the rate of combination produced by a small quantity of impurity. Bunsen and Roscor showed that the addition of y,%9 parts of oxygen reduced the
maximum action from 100 to 9°7. It is extremely difficult to prepare the gas
mixture with a definite quantity of impurity in it, and as yet no experiments have
been performed which are sufficiently comparable to determine the relation between
the quantity of the impurity and the rate of the action.
