“Using an old terminology, the short flights made by many locusts before stream-away

would be called rial flights, which are repeated as long as the conditions for take-off are
adequate, until more continuous flying occurs as soon as the conditions in mid-air are
appropriate for staying up’ (p. 38).
When one is considering taking-off, which is a dramatic change in individual behaviour, it is
natural to think in terms of reactions, but the mass departure depends, as far as the indi-
vidual is concerned, on the mere continuation, in place of the previously repeated cessation,
of an activity, flight, which was already in train, and which is destined sometimes to con-
tinue for many hours. This does not suggest a reaction at all.

The idea of a reaction would not have arisen, it appears, were it not for the fact that mass
departure starts, as arule, rather suddenly, as the only obvious break in the morning sequence
of movement-patterns. The main object of Gunn et al. was not to make a causal analysis
of the process by which a swarm becomes finally launched on migration, but rather to find
what governed the timing of this process. They considered the density of the locusts as likely
to govern the intensity of gregarious excitation, and in that sense as a factor comparable
with other regulating factors which vary from time to time and place to place, like tempera-
ture humidity, wind, etc. And among these, the factorial analysis pointed to air temperature
as the most important influence setting the time when flying about passed over into
stream-away.

So far the argument is straightforward, but at this point it makes a leap, with the sugges-
tion that the air temperature may not merely determine the time of mass departure, but be
