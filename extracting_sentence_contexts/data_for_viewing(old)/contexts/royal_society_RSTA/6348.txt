to exert a weak but sufficiently large attractive force on these atoms such that they remain within a
flat two-dimensional plane, and the deposited monolayer can be treated as a good representation
of the pure two-dimensional system. But in reality, even a perfectly smooth crystalline substrate
consists of a periodic arrangement of atoms, which interact individually with the atoms of the
monolayer. As a consequence, the arrangement of the atoms belonging to the surface of the
slab can induce a preference for a particular structure candidate of the two-dimensional system
(possibly with some slight distortion), which does not need to correspond to the global minimum
of the pure two-dimensional system. Even more dramatically, the slabâ€™s surface can induce a
structure for the monolayer, which does not even correspond to any local minimum structure
of the substrate-free pure two-dimensional monolayer. Such effects are taken advantage of in
atom beam epitaxial growth of thin films of specific crystalline structures [47,48], or during
heterogeneous nucleation of particular phases [49,50], and analogous phenomena are involved
in stabilizing metastable layered compounds [51,52]. Closely related is the fact that the atom level
granularity of the substrate surface will move the atoms of the monolayer slightly out of the
perfect two-dimensional plane, i.e. we would need to describe the atom positions in this layer via
both the x- and y-coordinates parallel to the substrate surface and the orthogonal z-coordinate.
Thus, the monolayer deposit is not perfectly two-dimensional, but exhibits a slight (spatially
varying) deformation into the third dimension, with non-trivial consequences for the modelling
of the system and the implementation of the global search for structure candidates, which can no
longer be restricted to purely two-dimensional atom configurations.

A second major difference to the structure prediction in three dimensions concerns the
moveclass of the search algorithm. In general, there are moves during our search on the energy
landscape, which imitate the movement of atoms in reality or during molecular dynamics
simulations; typically, these moves correspond to small shifts of individual atoms or groups
