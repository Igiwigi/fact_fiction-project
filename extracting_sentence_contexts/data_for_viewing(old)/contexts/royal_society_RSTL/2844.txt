to assert the uninterrupted continuity of the component parts of the fibre. They
proceed to point out a most important distinction © between the minute structures
of the muscles of voluntary motion and those of organic life.” The former, they as-
sert, © are characterized by innumerable very minute, but clear and fine parallel lines
or strize, which cross the fibre transversely.” These they conceive to be the distin-
guishing feature of true muscle. I shall have occasion again to refer to the yaluable
though brief observations of Messrs. Hopcxin and L1sTER on the subject of the mus-
cular fibre of organic life.

Having had the opportunity afforded me, by the kindness of my friend Mr. Henry
Goapsy, of testing the truth of the opinions of these eminent physiologists by the aid
of his admirable microscope, I beg to lay before the Society the results of some in-
quiries confirmatory of these opinions, and to add some new facts which I hope may
be not uninteresting to physiological inquirers,

The microscope which I have employed is an achromatic instrument, possessing a

magnifying power of about 600 diameters, by which the objects are exhibited with
remarkable distinctness. In order, however, to accomplish this with the best effect,
I bave invariably submitted the object to a careful preparation under a smaller mi-
croscope, used by Mr, Goapsy in his able dissections of the anatomy of insects, on
