The
claim of the gelatinous fibres to be considered true nervous fibres is further shown, by many small nerves being
entirely composed of them, and by the ultimate distribution of many of them to the arteries. The s0-called
white roots of the sympathetic are then branches of the spinal nerves, and are distributed to the viscera ; and
the 80-called gray roots, branches of the sympathetic, which passed from the thoracic ganglia, and are distri-
buted to the vessels in the neighbourhood. These facts were demonstrated by preparations at the time this
paper was presented to the Society, but in consequence of their differing from the received opinions upon the

subject, I was diffident of having drawings made from the preparations. The drawings, with their accompany-
ing explanations, will be presented in a supplementary paper.â€”(May 1846.) i
