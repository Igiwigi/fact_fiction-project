There is, therefore, little apology needed for an account embracing
Z the results obtained by the employment of some of the more modern methods of
> embryological study. = My account of the development of Balanus perforatus differed in so many respects
= from that of previous observers on the same and other Cirripedia, that I was induced
= to compare the development in a number of forms, believing that the wide differences
& stated to exist must be due, at any rate in part, to actual differences in the develop-
@ ment of the different forms, such as occurs in other groups in which the ontogeny of
& allied species and genera have been compared. This expectation was, however, only
3 partially realised ; I found, on the contrary, a great uniformity in the development of
Â© the different forms, an agreement, in fact, so close that all might be conveniently
treated together. The species studied were Balanus perforatus, Chthamalus stellatus,
Port; Lepas anatifera, Lyn. ; L. pectinata, Spencuer; and Conchoderma virgata,
Srencier. I was enabled by a comparison of these forms to confirm previous work
on certain points, and to establish other facts which have, in many cases, the merit
of reconciling apparently discordant opinions.
