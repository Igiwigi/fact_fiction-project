Remark. The distinction between «9 and « in the above problem may seem a mathematical :8

pedantry. But in fact it has a deep probabilistic and physical meaning. This follows from the :&
paper [21] where the following very special case was considered: the set T contains only three :S
elements (observables A, B, C), n = 2 (the observables take only two values), and xo = R (the P(x, y)
(x,y € {A,B,C} are usual 2 x 2 bi-stochastic matrices). In the language of this paper, the result
of [21] is that only in very special cases (described in the paper) does the generalized Markov
problem for the family of bi-stochastic matrices {P(x,y) : x,y € {A, B, C}} have a solution with « =
R: the generic case requires « = C. In other words, the emergence of complex numbers in quantum
theory is a necessity, coded into the experimentally measurable transition probabilities and not an
arbitrary choice. In general, given a family of transition probability matrices P(x, y) with entries
in xo, if the generalized Markov problem for it has a positive solution, the centre of the associated
Schwinger algebra will be an abelian extension of ko. The fact that two families of transition
probability matrices with entries in «9 admit Schwinger algebra models with isomorphic centre
is an equivalence relation among such families and the common centre « can be considered as a
statistical invariant of the equivalence class.

The name ‘generalized Markov problem’ is justified by the fact that this is the quantum
probabilistic analogue of the following, well-known, problem in classical probability: given a
family of (real-valued) transition probability matrices {P(s, t):s <t,s,t}, when does there exist a
Markov process (A(t)) such that, for each s < t, the transition matrix canonically associated to the
pair of random variables A(s), A(t) is P(s, t)?

It is well known that the classical probabilistic problem has a positive solution if and only if
the family of transition probability matrices (P(s, t)) satisfies the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation:
