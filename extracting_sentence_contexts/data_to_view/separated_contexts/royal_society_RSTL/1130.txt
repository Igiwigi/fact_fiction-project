coal C.C. are represented as interposed between DD
two atoms of water, each consisting of an atom (oleXo)
of hydrogen and an atom of oxygen. Dividing the diagram
vertically into three parts, we have the original substances ;
and separating it horizontally, we obtain the two-new com-
pounds. This theoretical view of the subject is confirmed
by the fact, that the carburetted hydrogen, formed at the
bottom of stagnant - pools, is never accompanied by carbonic
oxide, but always by carbonic acid, the full quantity of
which is prevented from appearing, in consequence of the
absorption of a great part of it by the mass of water, under
which the changes are taking place. Being provided with such an abundant supply of carbu-
retted hydrogen, I availed myself of it to examine the mutual
action of that gas and chlorine on each other, principally
with a view to ascertain, how far reliance may be placed on
the latter as an instrument in the analysis of mixed com-
bustible gases. This is a part of the subject that was first
investigated, though with a different view, by Mr. Cru1ck-
