to the next stage of your research. Even the often tedious business of dealing with referees’
comments (in what is called the peer-review process) and correcting proofs allows the details
to sink more deeply into the brain. Another good reinforcement comes from giving seminars as
discussed in §6b.

You should get into the habit of writing papers as soon as you have accumulated enough new
material; and many have observed that it is easier to publish a short, concise paper than it is to
publish a long and grand magnum opus.

Without this frequent writing of papers, a researcher may well be left after some years with
piles of unchecked, unorganized material, which is in many senses lost both to the individual
and to others. Indeed, the writing of papers can be viewed as a professional duty, since the pay
of academic staff is geared to the fact that at major universities they are expected not only to do
research, but also to publish it.

(d) Writing a paper: how

It is not my intention to deal in any depth with the wide subject of scientific and technical
writing, about which many books have been written. Two recommended works are by Zanders &
Macleod [26], which is short and jokey, and Doumont [27] which is a heavier read. Another
excellent source of advice, specifically for the writing of papers in mechanics, is the paper by
Villaggio [28]. Here, I just give, in the manner of the present article, a few tips drawn from my
own experiences. Always bear in mind, though, that a key concept of science is that a publication
should contain enough detail to allow a reader to repeat (and hopefully verify) the results
independently; assuming that the reader has access to the necessary equipment, which usually
