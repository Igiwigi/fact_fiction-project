It is remarkable, that, as regards the flexure of the intestine, similar contrasted
modifications of the archetype take place in those animals which are the nearest allies
of the Mollusca; I mean the Ascidians and Polyzoa, the Molluscoides of MiNe-
Evwarps. In each of these groups the intestine is always bent upon itself; but while
in the Ascidian the bend is always ha&mal, in the Polyzoon it is neural. The latter
fact is evident to any one who will examine a Polyzoon; the former may seem at first,
sight to be contradicted by the circumstance, that the ganglion in the Ascidians is
placed between the cloacal and branchial apertures. However, as I have endeavoured
to show elsewhere$, whatever be the position of the anus in the Ascidians, the first
bend of the intestine is always hazmal. I have already referred to their probable
analogy with Spirialis in this respect.
