This angle would
give about thirteen or fourteen nautic miles : and is probably
what they found by experience, to be the general amount of
the northern 'set.*

He goes on to say, that, in like manner, the safety of
ships, after they come into soundings, till they reach Scilly,
depended on their making no /ess allowance, than the Bristol
men do, in the other Channel. For, says he, © experience
* informs me, that from the commencement of soundings, in
« lat, 49* go'N. to the Tength of Scilly, in fair weather, I had
« found the northern indraught to be six- or eight miles in
« the twenty-four hours.”

Here then, the fact of the northern set, is a second time
recognised; though without any suspicion, any more than
before, of there being a westerly set, also. Here it may be proper to state, what appears to me to be
a very important fact ; although perhaps, not connected with
the current in question ; but materially affecting the safety
of the navigation, between the British Channel and Dublin. It was communicated to the Author, by Captain Evans, a
gentleman who superintends the harbour works at Holy-
head; and who has had much experience in the navigation
of the Irish sea.

* Although they, might not have known at that day, the true latitude of Cape
Clear, yet it may reasonably be supposed that they knew the quantity of the difference
of latitude, between Cape Clear, and the high land of Padstow ; as it was 50 neces-
sary to their purpose, and $0 easy to be obtained,

All navigators, says he, in their voyage from the Land's End
to Dublin, find themselves, more or less, carried to the east-
ward, whilst running up St. George's Channel : which is the
cause of 50 many vessels finding themselves in Cardigan
Bay; where, in tempestuous weather, and westerly winds,
many have been lost.
