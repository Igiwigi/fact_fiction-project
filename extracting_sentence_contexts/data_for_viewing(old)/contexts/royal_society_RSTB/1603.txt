ascending processes are invariably wanting, As regards its position, the relations of
the cresventic process of the tripus to each lateral air-sue are precisely sivoildr to Elose
of the sume structure in each lialfof the anterior chamber in a notmal Silnpoid, but in
shape it is variously modified. Very ravely does it ratuin its characteristic sicklelika —
form, more frequently ib is wearly straight, with a pointed distal extremity (eg,
Bagarius), or but slightly curved (¢ 7, Glyptosternum) ; exceptionally (eg., Clarias),
the orescentic process is curiously angalated and heeled. A ventral ridge is rarely
present—a fact which rust be associated with the general thinness of tlie walls of the
air-bladder, and the occusional degeneration of those fibres whieh normally converge
from the dorsal wall and ave inserted into it, The articular process of thie triyus is
usually long and tapering, with a pointed distal extremity, and retains its usual
relations with the anterior portion of the complex centrum, The anterior procasx
presents no special characters. Radial fibres can generally be detected, bat im some
cases are less obviously speciized than in others, and, where radial nodules are
absent, pass directly from the lateral surfaces of the complex centrum to the inner
or faintly concave murgins of the crescentic processes of the tripodes, On the other
hand, in these Suurocids in which the dorsal walls of the airsacs have degenerated,
radial fibres, if present at all, are very feebly developed (v.y., Bagarius, &e.).

Lateral cutaneous areas are almost invariably well marked, and, as a rule, clove the
