The total blindness of the eye opposite the more extensive destruction of the angular
Fyrus, viz. the left, was very manifest ; but the subsequent less extensive lesion of the
Ather angular gyrus produced only very transient effects, which might have escaped
Sbservation unless tested for s00n after the operation. But here, as in many other
Eases, the facts related show that at a period when all other faculties and powers
Were unimpaired, vision was distinctly defective. The period of reliable observation is
Hob to be determined by the mere length of time that has elapsed since the operation,
-Sr the rapidity of recovery is very variable, but by the indications that the animal is
Sn the alert, and otherwise in full possession of its other powers. In this case the
cond operation 8eemed to have caused 80 little general prostration that the animal
as able to run about almost immediately as if nothing had happened to it.
