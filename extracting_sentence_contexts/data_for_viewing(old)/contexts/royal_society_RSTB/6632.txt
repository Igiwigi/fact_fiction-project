what were then presumed to be the nasal capsules. This great divergence is not shown
in the photographs on pls. XXVII and XXXIII, and cannot have occurred on the
new interpretation of 1934, by which the nasal capsules are brought in towards the
middle line. As so modified the cranial cavity would very nearly fit an enlarged brain
of Osteolepis, and cannot be regarded as showing any special Elasmobranch resem-
blances. Nos. 5, 6 and 7 are concerned with the labyrinth. No. 5, the general character
of the labyrinth in Macropetalichthys, is as much that of Acanthodes as of an Elasmobranch.
No. 7, that the ductus endolymphaticus opened on the top of the head is true of
Climatius as well as of Elasmobranchs. No. 6, that there may have been an expansion
of the ductus endolymphaticus between the cartilaginous cranium and the dermal
bone of the skull roof, is of very little significance. No. 9 is of very little importance.
No. 11, the relation of the anterior end of the supraorbital canal to the nostril, is of
course completely changed by the alteration in the position of the nostril, and is in fact
as in Acanthodians, and not as in Elasmobranchs. Nos. 1 and 10 are dealt with
below. Professor Brortt added to the series of Elasmobranch resemblances of Macro-
petalichthys the following:

(1) The ventral position of the mouth.

(2) The structure of the mandible.

(3) The scales acting as teeth.

(4) The five branchial arches.
