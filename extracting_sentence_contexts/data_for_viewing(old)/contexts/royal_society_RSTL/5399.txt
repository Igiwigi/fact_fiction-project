* The vibrations take place with an intensity proportional (within certain limits) to
the difference of the conducting powers of the metals for heat, the metal having least
conducting power being necessarily the coldest.‚Äù

The evidence adduced against the validity of the first law appears to destroy this
one also; for if the vibrations are to be ascribed to a difference in the conducting
powers of the rocker and bearer, then when there is no such difference there ought
to be no vibrations. But we have shown, in half-a-dozen cases, that vibrations

occur when rocker and bearer are of the same metal. The same facts deprive the
latter part of the third law of its significance.

I will however cite one or two experiments, in which the conditions regarded
necessary by Professor Forsgs were reversed, and the effect was produced notwith-
standing.

1, Silver stands at the head of the conductors of heat. A copper rocker was laid
upon the edge of a thin plate of this metal ; strong musical notes were obtained from
the arrangement.

2. Forcible vibrations were produced by placing a brass rocker npon the same
Silver plate.
