accurately as to give this value of /3 the character of an ascertained quantity. 'The
probability is rather in favour of the theory that there is no slipping between air and
glass, and that the value of Þ given above results from accidental discrepancy in the
observations. I have therefore preferred to calculate the value of w on the supposition
that there is no slipping between the air and the glass in contact with it.

The value of depends on the nature of the gas and on its physical condition, By
making experiments in gas of different densities, it is 8hown that w remains constant,
s0 that its value is the same for air at 0:5 inch and at 30 inches pressure, provided
the temperature remains the same. This will be seen by examining Table IV., where
the value of L, the logarithm of the decrement of arc in ten single vibrations, is the
same for the same temperature, though the density is sixty times greater in s0me cases
than in others. In fact the numbers in the column headed L' were calculated on the
hypothesis that the viscosity is independent of the density, and they agree yery well
with the observed values.

It will be seen, however, that the value of L rises and falls with the temperature, as
given in the second column of Table IV. These temperatures range from 51* to 74*
Fahr., and were the natural temperatures of the room on different days in May 1865.
The results agree with the hypothesis that the viscosity is proportional to (461*+0),
the temperature measured from absolute zero of the air-thermometer. In order to test
this proportionality, the temperature was raised to 185” Fahr. by a current of steam
sent round the space between the glass receiver and the tin vessel. The temperature
was kept up for several hours, till the thermometer in the receiver became stationary,
before the disks were set in motion. The ratio of the upper temperature (185* F.) to
