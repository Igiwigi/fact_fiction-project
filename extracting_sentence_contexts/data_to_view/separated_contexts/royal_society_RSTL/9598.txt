This would indicate that the protoplasm of the cells, in passing through those
changes which result in the formation of granules, uses np the substance stainable
with osmic acid. This substance might be eibher taken up by the cell during secretion
to be further assimilated, or it might be an integral part of the cell-protoplasm. The facts we have at present are, I think, insufficient to allow any satisfactory con-
clusion to be drawn on this point ; but whatever the cause of it may be, it is, I think,
a very general phenomena, of cells to stain more deeply with osmic acid during active
secretion than during rest. TI have on a former occasion* pointed out that this is the
case in the parotid, sub-maxillary, lachrymal, and infra-orbital glands of the Rabbit. In parotid and sub-maxillary glands the resting cells treated with osmic acid show
lightly-stained cell-substance with darker-stained granules ; when the cells are
similarly treated after a period of secretion the cell-substance is distinctly more
deeply stained, the depth of staining increasiug within certain limits with the length
of time during which the cells have gecreted.
