The change began to take place in the coagulated
albumen in about eight or ten days; but wool and hair were the last which were affected. In about three months, the different liquids were become very dark, although scarcely
any perceptible quantity of the immersed $ubstances appeared to be dissolved. Nitric
acid, i a small proportion, changed these blue and brownish purple liquors to deep
yellow ; and ammoniac, being then added, changed them to orange colour, and pro-
duced all those effects which were observed, when the nitric solutions of these
substances were thus treated,

sembled gelatin,

It would be perhaps too hasty to assert, that gelatin was thus
absolutely formed ; but, if a substance 'so very similar to it
could be thus produced, we may with some reason conclude,
that the real gelatin, with its various modifications, is formed
from albumen, by the more efficacious and delicate operations of
nature,

In attempting to prove that albumen or the coagulating lymph
is the original animal substance, I have hitherto only stated
chemical facts; but, when the phenomena attending incubation
are considered; when the experiments made by eminent physio-
logists, such as HarLer, MaiTRE JEAN, and MALP1GH1, are
viewed; when the oviparous foetus is seen to be progressively
formed in and from the albumen of the egg, so that, upon the
bursting of the shell which separated it from external matter,
the young animal comes forth complete in all its parts; when
such strong facts as these are corroborated by those afforded
by chemistry, it can scarcely be doubted that albumen is the
primary animal substance, from which the others are derived;
and there is much cause to believe that the formation of gelatin,
and of the animal fibre especially, begins with the process of
sanguification in the foetus. As the three principal and essential component parts of the
blood, viz. albumen, gelatin, and fibre,* appear therefore to

* The whole of the blood, which by anatomists is divided into serum, red globules,
and coagulating lymph, when chemically examined, is found to consist of albumen,
gelatin, and fibre. The serum which remains liquid after the coagulation of the blood,
is composed of albumen, gelatin, some saline matter, and much water,

The clot or crassamentum also affords, by repeated washing, a large proportion of
