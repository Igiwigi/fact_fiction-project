6. Effect of Heating in a current of Ammonia. Several experimenters state, that when copper is heated in ammonia, the gas is decom-
posed and nitride of copper formed, a fact which ScaRo0TTERÂ® disputes, and has been
proved totally incorrect by Dick. We repeated the experiment by heating a copper
wire, whose conducting power had been previously determined, for a quarter of an hour
in a current of dry ammonia ; when cold, the conducting power was found the same, and
the wire was as ductile as before. In all probability the reason why in the experiments
of previous observers the copper became brittle, was (as already suggested by Dick)
that they used copper containing suboxide.
