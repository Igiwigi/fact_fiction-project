constant wave phasespeed (cf. [5,14]). With w and k assumed to be locally constant, (4.4) can

be written as

(@ —kY)V7 Wy + kV? Wz =0. (4.6)

With respect to applications in water waves, this equation provides the basis for the method
introduced by Dean [30] for computing the kinematics of nonlinear waves, albeit specifically for

irrotational motion (2 =0) when (4.6) reduces to V7W =0, matching (4.2). This was extended : =
by Dalrymple [31] for nonlinear waves interacting with a rotational current. Although it may be : =
possible to formulate the governing equations in terms of p or W alone, as in (4.6) for W, it should LB
be noted that the two quantities are in fact related via the dynamic surface boundary condition : =
(2.1e); we remark that although (2.1e) appears quite innocuous, it transforms to a highly complex, : a
nonlinear Bernoulli relation when expressed in terms of the streamfunction. 74

In the present approach, attention is directed at the pressure as specified by (2.1b), and it is : >
assumed that (4.6) can be solved, as required, even for rotational flow. Returning to (2.1b), and : =
employing (4.1), enables the first equation to be expressed as : S
