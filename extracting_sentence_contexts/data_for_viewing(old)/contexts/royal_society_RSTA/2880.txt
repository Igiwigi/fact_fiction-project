in which E is the short-time modulus that can be obtained from the initial slope of the load-
crack mouth opening displacement plot and C is as yet left unspecified. The truncated fractional
power-law form of the creep compliance in (3.1) corresponds to a three-parameter fractional linear
solid [15].

4. Viscoelastic fictitious crack model

To analyse sea ice fracture tests in the presence of coupled creep and fracture deformations, it
proved necessary to first develop a viscoelastic-fictitious-crack-model (VFCM) [16]. The basis for
this approach is the fictitious crack model (FCM) [17] as well as the creep compliance function
in (3.1).

In its unloaded state, the fabricated (sawn) crack may be viewed as having a well-defined
crack tip with a point-sized process zone. On being loaded, this through-the-thickness crack has =
no well-defined traction-free crack tip (figure 2a) but rather may be viewed as a traction-free 15
crack attached to a fracture process zone, within which the localized micro-cracking, bridging and : -
micro-crack coalescence accumulates at the same time as (normal to the crack plane) the tensile ae
closing stress decreases (while the separation of two adjacent points on either side of the crack :
plane increases). Before the application of an opening load, the effective crack length may truly be [4
taken equal to the pre-sawn length; this is not true once the load has been applied. Loading causes DN
micro-cracking and bridging, and the effective crack length increases. In the VFCM, the separation a
