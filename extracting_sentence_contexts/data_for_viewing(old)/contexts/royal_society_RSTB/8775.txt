‘They are a serious class’.

The initial sentence in (2) establishes a large locus—
labelled as ‘ab’—that corresponds to all of the students in
the class. The signer then indicates an embedded sublocus
(‘a’) that corresponds to the group of students who came to
class. Critically, although the complement locus ‘b’ was
never explicitly introduced, it is nonetheless available for
interpretation. Schlenker et al. [13] argue that the complement
interpretation is available solely by virtue of the geometric
properties of the locations traced in signing space. Namely,
the fact that the small locus is contained within the larger
locus allows the third (complement) locus to come into
existence and to be available for reference.

Schlenker et al. [13] suggest that there is a structured
mapping between the geometric configuration of the circu-
lar loci traced in signing space and the semantic
denotations of those loci. This type of structural iconicity
is not available for spoken language. However, signed and
spoken languages are not argued to be fundamentally
different with respect to grammatical constraints—both dis-
allow ‘complement set anaphora’ since (1b) is unacceptable
in ASL (and LSF) with a default locus. The iconic properties
