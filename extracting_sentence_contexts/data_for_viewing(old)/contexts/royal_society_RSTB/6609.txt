The most important specimens, as evidence of this elongated form of test are H. 1
and E. 27003. H. 1, as stated already, is the greater part of an internal mould (only
. the apex is missing) together with much of the external casing. It is definitely elongate
with the mouth at one extremity (fig. 4, Pl. 17). E. 27003 also has an elongate under-
surface with the mouth at one extremity.

x 3, from the holotype.

The holotype, which at first sight suggests a spherical form, has been somewhat
distorted, but there is no doubt that here again the mouth is excentric.

We can deduce from the fossil remains two important facts: (1) that the test was
thinner than in either Aulechinus or Ectinechinus; (2) that the test was elongate, with
mouth and anus at opposite poles very much as in Ectinechinus.

The reconstructions (figs. 14A,B) are based on the above deductions. Dorsally
the form is made to resemble Ectinechinus except that the ambulacra have stronger
curves and the valves of the anus are fewer and stouter.

Ventrally the reconstruction has one important difference from that of Ectin-
echinus. Both TV and V are well seen on the surface. The median line of symmetry
is between IV and V, that is in inter-radius 4. This form therefore is built about a
II-4 plane rather more than Ectinechinus.
