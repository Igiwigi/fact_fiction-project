A'The curve H H of weight of hull in this case bears a certain resemblance to that of the
© Bellerophon * in fig. 3, only the cusps P, P are more pronounced on account of the
armoured bulk-heads of the upper-deck battery. This fact also accounts in part for the
difference between the curves of total weight W W for the two ships. It is only neces-
sary to add that the length of the © Audacious * is 280 feet, and that the same scales
have been used for lengths and weights in fig. 4 as in the preceding diagrams.
