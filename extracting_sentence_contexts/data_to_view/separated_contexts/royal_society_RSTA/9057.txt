SHEPPARD: THE FIT OF A FORMULA FOR DISCREPANT OBSERVATIONS.

the supposition that the “best” values of the constants were to be used; but it is
instructive to begin without making this supposition.

(i) Using a, and ay, as in the first method of § 19, I obtained

y2=14:99160 4, y,=3-87189 9. From this, using PEarson’s formula (3.5), we get

P=0-01039 8. But, if we use Fiser’s modification (ref. 3, p. 93) of Pearson’s formula, #.e. (see § 10
above) replace m in (3.5) by m — k (= 3), we get

P=0:-00182 4.
(ii) Using a, and ag, as in the second method of § 19, we get

v2 =14-98679 1, y, = 387127 8;
and thence
P=0-01041 9 or 0-00182 8,

according as we use m = 5 or replace it by m — k= 3.

(iii) The values of y,2 obtained by these two methods happen to agree with one
another very well, but they are much too great, and therefore give too small a value
of P, even if we retain y~* instead of y™-‘-? in the integration, This result is due to
the fact that in each case we take account of only two values of a, so that we are using
a distribution which is a poor fit to the data. Let us therefore see what happens if we
use the best fit we can get, namely, the distribution for which the mean and the s.d.
have their most probable values. Since the numbers involved are large, this (as may
be seen by applying StrriiNe’s theorem to (1.4) of Appendix I) is practically the same
thing as using the minimum value of ,2 (¢f.
