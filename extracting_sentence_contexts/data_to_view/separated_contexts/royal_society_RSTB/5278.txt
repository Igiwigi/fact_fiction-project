ultimately disappear, so that at higher levels the cortical sclerenchyma of the petiole

is either directly in contact with the epidermis or is merely separated from it locally

by small shallow patches of parenchyma from one to four cells in width (text-fig. 12). Although we may, at this point, conveniently defer the further study of the petiolar

anatomy and that of its associated structures

until the relationship of the roots and aphlebiz

to the stem has been considered, reference may

be made to an exceptional type of petiole trace

which has occasionally been met with during

the course of this study. It is characterised

by the fact that, instead of becoming elongated

tangentially and developing the characteristic

abaxial curvature, it assumes a stout symmetri-

cal ovoid outline very like that of Dineuron. A petiole of this type in which the median TEXT-FIG. 12.—Transverse section of a part
