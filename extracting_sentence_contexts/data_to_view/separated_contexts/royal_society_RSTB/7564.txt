Greater or smaller changes in the lateral field of view are an inevitable accompani-
ment of continued movement. They are produced by objects which are not in the direct
path of the insect and so not incompatible with its continued movement. But objects in the
direct path of the insect are often physically incompatible with its continued movement and,
physically or merely sensorily incompatible, they do in fact provoke active compensatory
responses having the effect of restoring to the anterior field of view the general character to
which the moving insect has become accustomed. If this be true of hoppers, then we should
expect to find adult migrants behaving with relation to a ‘wall’ on land much as do hoppers,
although on a larger scale. Such behaviour is in fact well known: the tendency of swarms to
move along valleys.
