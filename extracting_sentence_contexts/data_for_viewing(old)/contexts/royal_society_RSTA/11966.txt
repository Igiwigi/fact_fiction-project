In the second series of experiments, the coil was wound on porcelain strips, aud we
were quite satisfied that the water equivalent was known with sufficient accuracy.
Nevertheless the agreement of the results in this series is not satisfactory.

In experiments 4 and 6 the thermometer was falling both in the first and last
period, and the cooling correction was consequently somewhat large ; on the other
hand the lag of the fulling thermometer would affect both the first and last period,
and, therefore, be partly eliminated in the result.

Experiment 5 is rendered a little uncertain by the fact that the thermometer at
the beginning of the first period fell slightly, and then remained perfectly stationary ;
it is therefore probable that the temperature was really increasing at the beginning of
the experiment. The cooling correction, calculated on the assumption of no rise,
would be too large, hence the calculated equivalent too small. The result of March 8th
is anomalous, and does not seem altogether accounted for by the sticking of the
thermometer at the end. There was on that day an exceptionally large difference
in the amount of water, as measured by weight and by volume. We took, as
usual, the mass as determined by weight ; had we taken the latter, the calculated
equivalent would have been 4181. A final revision of our calibration correction
showed a small error, which may have affected some of the results in series I. and
IL, by about one part in two thousand. As we do not attach any value to the
numbers obtained, we have not recalculated the numbers.
