The analysis presented herein is one step towards this goal,
and a number of points can be improved. Most notably, some effort can be made on post-
processing a beam hardening correction, more advanced filtering methods (bilateral filtering
would be particularly suitable), as well as a tailor-made edge detector giving correctly sized
cracks. Furthermore, despite its success in separating the fragments seen above, the watershed
method could be improved to take into account two physical realities: (i) the fact that some cracks
can exist without splitting the material and (ii) the geometry of the specimen. As to the latter,
the region-growing part of the watershed algorithm grows isotropically, whereas the limited
