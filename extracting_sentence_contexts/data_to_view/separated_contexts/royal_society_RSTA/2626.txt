The total
emission values as well as the calculated possible savings in the three scenarios for this ship class
are given in electronic supplementary material, table S1. Our calculations showed possible fuel
savings of 16.91 kg to 67.63 kg and cost savings of 9.64 US$ to 38.55 US$ per nautical mile in the
three scenarios for the ULCV Emma Maersk. For the Emma Maersk, we calculated the values for a fictional journey AE10â€”Eastbound
(Gdansk, Poland to Ningbo, China) of around 11 900 nautical miles (one way) [53]. The calculated
possible fuel savings for this journey are between 201 187.4kg and 804749.4kg, meaning CO2-
emission savings between 629716.4 and 2,518,865.6kg and cost savings of 114676.8 US$ to
458 707.2 US$. The detailed results for the three scenarios are given in electronic supplementary
material, table $2.
