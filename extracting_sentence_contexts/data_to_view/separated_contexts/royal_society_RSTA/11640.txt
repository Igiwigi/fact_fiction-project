Focus of Regression.—We
thus see that, on the theory with which we are concerned, a knowledge of the ancestry
beyond the parents in no way alters our judgment as to the size of organ or degree of
characteristic probable in the offspring, nor its variability.* An exceptional father
is as likely to have exceptional children if he comes of a mediocre stock as if he comes
of an exceptional stock. The value of { will be no greater nor the value of %, less if
the parents have been selected for p generations than if they have been selected for
one only. This result seems to me somewhat surprising, but I cannot see how it is
to be escaped so long as we assume the normal distribution of frequency, which
appears in so many cases to be a close approximation to fact. It is of course possible

# This seems specially noteworthy ; it would seem natural to suppose that the offspring of a long
selected stock would be less variable than those of one just started—that the offspring of a gradually
created variety would be more stable than those so to speak of a sport. It appears not.
