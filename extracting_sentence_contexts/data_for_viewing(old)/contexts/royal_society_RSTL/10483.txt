oceurring during the explosion of these gases. An account of this investigation,
carried on during severa] years, I venture to bring before the Royal Society, in the
belief that the results obtained clear up some discrepancies between the observations
of previous workers, and prove that, under the simplest conditions, the division of the
oxygen is determined by the reciprocal reaction of two pairs of gaseous bodies, forming
a 8ystem in mobile equilibrium capable of exact expression by a simple formula.

Hexry's experiments.

The first experiments on the incomplete combustion of hydrogen and carbonic oxide
were made by Hrnry. In a memoir printed in these Transactions (1824), Hexry
compared the action of the electric spark and of platinum sponge on mixtures
of carbonic oxide and electrolytic gas. He discovered the fact that the lower the
temperature at which the reaction occurs the greater is the proportion of carbonic acid
produced,

He writes : Â© I made numerous experiments to ascertain whether the oxygen, under

these cireumstances of slow combustion, is divided between the carbonic oxide and
the hydrogen in proportions corresponding to the volumes of those two gases. The
combustible gases being in equal volumes, and the oxygen sufficient to saturate only
