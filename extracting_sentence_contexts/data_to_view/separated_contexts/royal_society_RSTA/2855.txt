Equation (7.2) is shown as the dashed line on figure 8. Barring roughness, which remains to be
incorporated, the model captures the dry-sliding measurements quite well. The fact that the kinetic friction of sea ice and freshwater ice is practically indistinguishable,
even though bulk sea ice creeps more rapidly, is again taken to mean that asperities and the
underlying deformation zone are too small to contain creep-enhancing pockets of brine.

(c) Dryâ€”wet sliding: velocity weakening =

As already mentioned, fundamental to velocity weakening is frictional heating and the creation of a
meltwater. Yet, direct observations of water at the sliding interface are lacking. There is, however, DG
indirect evidence, deduced from Coulombic shear faults.
