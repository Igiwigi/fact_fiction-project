Posteriorly to the region of the medullary plate last dealt with, the ganglionic
plate thins out, and gradually becomes indistinguishable as as such in section, before
the neighbourhood of the first somite is reached,

The outer and more solid half of the vago-glossopharyngeal plate (“g-v. 1.”) is
seen, in fig. 96, to extend so far laterally that its outer margin overlaps the inner
limit of the parietal or pericardial ccelom.

(4) GENERAL PRESENTATION AND SumMARY oF Features or NEURAL ORGANISA-
TION IN THE “ NeURULAR” SvTaGe IN ORNITHORHYNCHUS.

On the basis of the foregoing facts and observations, we believe that it may
be possible to frame the outline of a general conception of the neural organisation of
the cephalic region in Ornithorhynchus.

In the stages above treated of, we have been dealing with a neural axis which long
preserves its primitive flattened condition as a neural plate, and is thus quite
uninfluenced by various factors which in other forms complicate the problem of early
brain-development. For not only does the mere transformation of a flattened plate
into a tube itself complicate the investigation of the early structural features, but,
associated with this process, there arise a series of mesodermal differentiations which
more or less directly modify and obscure the fundamental structural arrangements.
Now it is hardly too much to say that here, in Ornithorhynchus, we have the
spectacle of the earlier processes of neural development proceeding without any
