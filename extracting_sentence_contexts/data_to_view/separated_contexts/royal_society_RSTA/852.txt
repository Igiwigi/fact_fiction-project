The actual path followed by the wave-packet still remains
to be investigated. There emerges from this interpretation of figs. 7 and 8 an interesting and important
fact concerning the critical electron density which must be attained in the ionosphere
in order to return a magneto-ionic component to the surface of the earth. It might be
thought that this critical electron density could be deduced by putting the angle of
refraction y equal to 47 in Snell’s Law as we did in (2) for the case when the earth’s
magnetic field is neglected. Since, from fig.
