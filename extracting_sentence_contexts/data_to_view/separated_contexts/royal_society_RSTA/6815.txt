It may be noticed that in tensor calculus (Eddington 1923, p. 111), when a tensor is
converted into a tensor density, a factor 1/ Vg is introduced, and a factor /g is alwz vys intro-
duced when a tensor is integrated diecuah a volume. The necessity for the introduction of
such an irrational expression as ,/g would be otherwise difficult to explain, but it is clear that
the presence of this factor is really indicative of the presence of the alternating tensor. In fact, if the element of volume is a generalized parallelepiped with edges 4, x,, 3, ,,
6%; then the volume dV of this element is given by

BV = Bim ind x, dy,

which shows the appropriate position of the alternating tensor in an integration formula. It is a characteristic property of the alte rnating tensor when taken over the orthogonal

group, i.e. the group of transformations which leave the metric tensor invariant, that it is

invariant for a proper rotation, but is changed in sign by an improper rotation, i.e. an
