mately aligned with those of hydrocarbon chain segments from
the POPC membrane, as shown in figure 1c, and with decreasing
AP as shown in figure 2. This occurs presumably due to the
tendency to maximize the van der Waals contacts between the
hydrophobic chains during the insertion process.

Interestingly, previous work [21] has shown that spherical
PS nanoparticles could enter cells, whereas disc-shaped nano-
particles tended either to enter and remain in the lipid bilayers
or just bind to the membrane surface. In this case, the particles

ad a diameter of 20 nm, which is more than an order of mag-
nitude larger than those in this work. In fact, other modelling
22] on carbon nanoparticles has shown that elongated par-
ticles have a smaller free energy barrier to permeate the
membrane compared with that of spherical particles. This

ighlights the importance of nanoparticle surface topology in
influencing the behaviour of membrane interactions.

PE nanoparticles are expected to gain in chain mobility
when they are immersed in a sea of ‘good solvent’

ydrophobic tails in the inner part of the membrane. Sub-
sequently, the nanoparticles expand. However, the extent of
