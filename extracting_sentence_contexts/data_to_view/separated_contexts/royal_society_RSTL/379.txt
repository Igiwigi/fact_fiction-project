The liquor when filtered produced no redness in
tincture of litmus, and every thing proved that the fluid by
mere agitation over the carbonate, had been completely neu-
tralised. The same results which ScHEELE obtained from lime were
afforded by carbonate of barytes: but with sorbic acid I pro-
duced a liquor which showed no signs of acidity. The best
test for ascertaining this fact, seemed to be infusion of brazil
wood altered by distilled vinegar; and with this it even
appeared, that the solution contained an excess of base. Thus it appears, that malic acid never forms with carbo-
nate of lime, any other than acidulous salts; and, as SCHEELE
observes, these solutions in some days deposit the neutral salt
in crystals. But with these carbonates, the sorbic acid forms
neutral salts, which, as s00n as formed, precipitate.
