With regard to the Soufriére Hills he appears to have been lucky, for it is
clear from his account, and from the titles of his illustrations, that he took Chance’s
Mountain, and the spur to the north of it, to be distinct and little-trenched volcanic
cones; they aré parts of the same volcano separated by a deep gorge (p. 28). It is
beyond the scope of the present paper to discuss Davis’s ingenious explanation of the
truncated spurs of the islands of the Lesser Antilles in terms of coral reefs and glacial
control. As regards Montserrat, the facts can be explained more simply (p. 19). Mr F. A. Perret, the well-known American volcanologist, visited the island several
times during the earthquake period of 1934—5, and submitted to the Governor of the
Leeward Islands a number of valuable reports on the earthquake and soufriére
activity; these were published by the Colonial Office. Mr Perretis at present engaged
in preparing for publication a scientific account of his work in Montserrat.
