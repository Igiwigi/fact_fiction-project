The interfollicular spaces are filled with a connective tissue, and with many
cells more closely resembling those of the glandular epithelium than of normal connective
tissue. It was found that mitotic activity was extremely slight. Both the glandular epi-
thelial cells and the cells of the interfollicular spaces were only rarely seen in division, and,

after long searches, no cell divisions were found. In the other three individuals occasional
