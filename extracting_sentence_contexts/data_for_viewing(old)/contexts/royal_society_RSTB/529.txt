Then, as to the conditions under which the free nitrogen has been brought into
combination? The negative result with the Gramine, the negative result with the
peas when everything was sterilised, or when the sand was not seeded by the soil-
extract, the positive result with the peas when the sand was seeded by the humus soil
extract, the negative result with the lupins when their soils were not seeded, or when
they were seeded with the same extract as the peas, and the positive result when
seeded with the extract from the sandy soil where lupins were growing, seem to
exclude any other conclusion than that the micro-organisms supplied by the soil
extracts were essential agents in the process of fixation. Further, the development

of nodules on the roots was, to say the least, a coincident of the fixation. To
HetLRincEt’s conclusions on this point, the objections have been raised,—first that
the nodules are a result and not a cause of active growth, and that in fact they con-

stitute a supply of reserve material for growth ; and secondly that the investigations
of TscurrcH and Bruncuorst, prove that the nodules have no external communication
with the soil. As to the latter objection, it may be observed, that Professor MARSHALL
Warp has recently shown that, on the death of the nodules, the micro-organisms become
distributed within the soil; and further, that in the case of HenirmcE.’s experi-
