650 MR. J. LISTER ON THE EARLY STAGES OF INFLAMMATION.

The red corpuscles also often adhere to the colourless ones.

It will be seen hereafter that the corpuscles of blood within the vessels of the living
body present great yarieties of adhesiveness, according to the amount of irritation to
which a part may be subjected; such variations are als met with in blood outside the
body, in consequence of differences in the quality of the plasma.

If a drop of very thick solution of gum-arabic, freshly prepared and free from acidity,
be added to about four drops of blood, the red corpuscles of the mixture will be found
to aggregate much more speedily and more closely than those of ordinary blood, a fact
ascertained some years ago by Mr. Wrarrox Joxts and some other obseryers *. The
result is the formation of dense orange masses with large colourless interspaces, but
without much regular appearance of rouleaux. On closely examining such a specimen,
the red discs are seen to be much diminished in breadth and increased in thickness, and
exhibit an extreme degree of adhesiveness, sticking together indifferently by their edges,
or any other parts that happen to come first; and if one of the masses be stretched 80
as to break, the separating corpuscles become drawn out into long viscid processes,
which at length give way in the middle, and each half is drawn into its respective
corpuscle.

This remarkable effect cannot be accounted for by the mere viscidity of the plasma,
which would not make the corpuscles adhere to each other more intimately than usual,
