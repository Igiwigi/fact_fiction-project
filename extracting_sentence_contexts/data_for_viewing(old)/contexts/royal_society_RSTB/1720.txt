present no special difficulties, being evidently stems of the normal type at an early
stage of development. In these young specimens the outer cortex is mainly scleren-
chyraatous, with only narrow radial bands of parenchyma. The great development
of the latter in older stems was, no doubt, largely due to dilatation induced by the —
secondary growth.

Returning to the stems in which the primary structure is on a small scale and is
peculiar in type, we may distinguish two categories. The one is represented by
fig. 2 in Memoir IV. and fig. 11 in Memoir XVIL., the other by fig. 12 in Memoir XVII.
In the former type the primary xylem forms an almost complete ring, or, at least,
is not differentiated into distinct bundles; in the second type, the bundles surrounding
the pith are quite distinct and normal, but the whole is on an extremely small scale.
In fact, the smallest stems we have, one of which is only 3 millims. in diameter,
belong to this type. These smallest stems have secondary wood of considerable thick-
ness (about 14 cells thick). Cambium aud phloém are well preserved, and the leaf-
traces are evident in the cortex. The phyllotaxis appears to have been $. In one

of the specimens the outer cortex is of the normal “ Dictyoxylon” type, with the
nchymatous bands already dilated. On the whole, we may say that these tiny
