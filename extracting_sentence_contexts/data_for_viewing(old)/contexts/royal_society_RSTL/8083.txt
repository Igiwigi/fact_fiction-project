powers, the required number is =coeff. a%a* in A(az). The formula, in fact, indicates
"that the covariants are made up of (aa, #*a*, a*a*, a*), the cubic itself, the Hessian, the
cubicoyariant, and the discriminant, these being connected by a syzygy (4%*) of the
degree 6 and order 6. Compare Second Memoir, No. 50, according to which the
number of covariants of degree 0 is
