9, the curves of f,/e have a rather higher linear limit than the
corresponding f/e curve, but here again the ratio f/f, is still linear to about the
same range as in previous cases. The case of plates } inch thick, fig. 10, is more especially interesting from the fact
that the stress-strain curve there shown is, at a later stage, obtained entirely from
the optical effects observed from an analysis of the spectrum of a beam under
uniform bending moment. It is sufficient to remark here that the f/f, curve shows
a somewhat lower limit of linearity, although both the other curves have
corresponding limits of 2000 Ibs. per sq. inch.
