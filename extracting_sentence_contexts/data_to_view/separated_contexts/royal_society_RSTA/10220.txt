ITS EFFECT ON TEMPERATURE AND ITS PRESSURE ON SMALL BODIES. 541

The force on A due to B is mal? R’/Ud?, where R’ = aN’. These are not equal unless R= PR’, @e., unless the two bodies have the same
temperature, an illustration of the fact that equality of action and reaction does not
hold between the radiating and receiving bodies alone. They no longer constitute
the whole of the momentum system. The ether, or whatever we term the light-
bearing medium, is material, and takes its part in the momentum relations of the
system,

If the surfaces are partially or totally reflecting, the forces are easily obtained.
