predictions are also in good agreement with the asymptotic analysis and confirm that within
regime II, Di hag is insensitive to K; see the overlap in figure 5 between the predictions with
K=10? and 10°.

The map in figure 5 is over a very wide range of parameters with large portions of the map
mostly inaccessible for typical hydrogen EP experiments in Fe alloys. It is thus instructive to
examine the response over a range of parameters more representative in such experiments. In this
regard, we include in figure 7a,b numerical predictions of contours of Diag (with Hag defined
as above) for op =10-° and 10~’, respectively, for a test temperature T = 1. These contours are
presented on a map with axes of N and AH: in line with the predictions in figure 5, we observe
that Dihtag increases with decreasing AH (deeper traps), increasing trap density N and decreasing
hydrogen concentration op. Moreover, the contours of Dihtag suggest that there is a regime where
hag is independent of AH and another where hag increases linearly with N. In fact, the asymptotic
analysis indicates that both the maps in figure 7 span regimes I and II with the boundary between
the two regimes given by a transition value of the binding energy
