posed law, according to which the magnetic Force should everywhere increase in a
certain expressed ratio with the increase of the magnetic latitude, inapplicable to the
phenomena, but the modification which has latterly been substituted, —© the law,” as
it has been lately expressed, © of the general increase of the magnetic Force with the
magnetic latitude,” —seems scarcely justified by the facts; and it may be doubted
whether this expression is not more likely to mislead, by perpetuating the erroneous
hypothesis in which it first took its rise, than to be of advantage as an empirical law,
where the exceptions are 80 considerable. It is obvious that a too hasty generaliza-
tion from observations made in those regions of the globe where the Force decreases
with the increase of the dip, (as for example in the twenty degrees of latitude, or there-
abouts, in North America, comprised between the point of maximum of the Force, and
the point of 90? of Inclination,) might have appeared to justify an inference which would
have been the direct contrary of the above-mentioned law. There is in fact no such con-
nection between the Inclination and the Force as will justify the one being spoken of
as an immediate function of the other, or will sanction a general statement, that the
increase of the one is to be looked for from the increase of the other, or vice versd.

I have generally preferred, in these Contributions, the employment of the expres-
