This theory I shall apply here, not to the ordinary finite solution, but to the solution
by definite integrals of the differential equation (I). In doing this I shall give to U and
V the particular values 0. We are justified in doing this by the canons relating to the
arbitrary constants which are laid down in the memoir ; but it will suffice here to direct
attention to the fact that while the processes employed are strictly speaking particular,
they lead to a solution involving the requisite number of arbitrary constants, and at
the same time of the proper form, as manifested by the snecession of the indices in its
development.
