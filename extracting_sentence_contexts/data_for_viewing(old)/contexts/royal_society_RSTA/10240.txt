assumed to be almost identical. In his ‘Schwerkraft im Hochgebirge,’ published in
1890, Professor HetMErtT gave a mathematical solution of the problem, and his
writings have closed the controversy.

A graphical interpretation of the results of Table I. is given in Plate 14, the method
by which the several ordinates are computed being explained in Table IT. below. The
first figure of the Plate shows the height above sea-level, as determined by spirit
levelling, of the surface of India along its central meridian. The second figure shows
the deficiency of matter in the underlying crust, as deduced from Basevi'’s pendulum
results. The third figure gives the differences between the ordinates in the two
upper figures, and shows the surface of India as it would be if the crust were
everywhere of equal density. An examination of the figures of this Plate brings to
light four significant facts :—

(1) That there exists in the earth’s crust throughout India a general deficiency
of matter as compared to Europe ;+

(2) That the apparent excess of matter above sea-level, which the eye observes
at Moré (Station 43) under the form of mountains, is largely compensated
by subjacent deficiencies ;

(3) That an extraordinary deficiency of matter underlies the stations of Dehra
Dun, Kaliana and Nojli (Nos. 38, 37, 36), stations situated not in the
Himalayas, like Mussooree (No. 41), but in the plains at the foot of
the Himalayas; this deficiency leads one to believe that the pressure
