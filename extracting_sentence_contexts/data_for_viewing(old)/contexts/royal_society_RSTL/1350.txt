which incites the Muscles of Animals to contract. 253

of the moisture of the animal ? ? Further, a consequence of this
opinion is, that, if the under surfaces of two different metals
be placed in moisture, and their upper surfaces be afterwards
connected by means of a nerve, Still attached to its muscle,
contractions ought then to be produced; since the whole quan-
tity of the electric fluid necessary to restore the equilibrium,
which has been disturbed by the action of the metals, must
pass through the nerve. This experiment I have made, and as
I did not find the muscle to contract, I must hold Mr. VoLTA's
opinion on this point to be likewise ill founded. The fact js,
that as far as the contraction of muscles is a test, whether the
influence exists or not, and we have no other, it is never ex-
d cited, when two 'metals, or one metal and charcoal are neces-
sary for this purpose, unless these substances touch each other,
and are also in contact with some of the fluids formerly men-
tioned.
But there is still another requisite for the excitement of the
influence, which is a communication, by means of some good
Â© conductor of electricity, between the two quantities of fluid,
to which the dry exciters are applied, beside that which takes
place between the same quantities of fluid, when the dry ex-
citers are brought into contact with each other. As from this
