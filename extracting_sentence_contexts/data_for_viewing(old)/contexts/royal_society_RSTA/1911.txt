So it was on the 6th of March 1869 at a meeting of the Russian Chemical Society in St Petersburg
when a paper by Dmitri Mendeleev with the title ‘Relation of the Properties to the Atomic Weights
of the Elements’ was read to the audience by Nikolai Menshutkin, an associate of Mendeleev’s
(figure 1). Apparently the author himself was away on a trip to inspect the cheese-making
procedures employed in the Russian countryside!

Chemistry is not merely an immense collection of facts, but more an exact science that teaches
us to classify and arrange these facts, and that classification must begin with the chemical
elements themselves.

Thus, in 1869, Mendeleev’s advance, unlike many attempts of his many predecessors, used.
two sets of data for a complete classification of the chemical elements, namely, elements’
atomic weights and their inherent similarities in chemical properties [2]. With this epoch-
making advance, the resulting periodic law of the chemical elements was born. Not only did
Mendeleev show that a remarkable, natural periodicity existed in the chemical properties of the
elements then known, but he also had the courage and the vision to state that this method of
classification constituted a fundamental law of nature and identified gaps in the classification as
then-undiscovered elements (figure 2).
