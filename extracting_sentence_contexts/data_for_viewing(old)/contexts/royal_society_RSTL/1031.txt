ments of which I am about to give an account will, I think,
demonstrate in the most satisfactory manner, not only that the
force of fired gunpowder is in fact much greater than has been
imagined, but also that its. force consists principally in the
temporary action of a fluid not permanently elastic, and con-
sequently that all the theories hitherto proposed for the eluci-
dation of this subject, must be essentially erroneous.

The first step towards acquiring knowledge is undoubtedly
that which leads us to a discovery of the falsehood of received
opinions. To a diligent inquirer every common operation,
performed in the usual course of practice, is an experiment,
from which he endeavours to discover some new fact, or to
confirm the result of former inquiries.

Having been engaged many years: in the investigation of
the force of gunpowder, I occasionally found many oppor-
tunities of observing, under. a variety of circumstances, the
various effects produced by its explosion ; and as/a long habit
of meditating upon this subject rendered every thing relating



the Force of fired Gunpowder. 235
