of the spatial points. In §5, we study phase synchronization of the dynamics using the Barrow—
Kuramoto coupling as an example, provide an elementary proof of the dynamical equation
describing the coupling of one Mixmaster spatial point to the mean field, and show how this
leads to a direct coupling between two spatial points. In §6, we study the implications of sync to
the possibility of eventual convergence to a common sequence of values of two BKL maps that
correspond to two different spatial points, and discuss the resulting physical interpretation of the
effects of sync. We conclude in the last section with a discussion of other issues not considered in
the present work, as well as further conjectural implications that follow directly from our results.

2. Evolution of spatial Mixmaster points

It is a basic fact that in the inhomogeneous Mixmaster model each spatial point evolves like a separate
homogeneous Mixmaster universe as we approach the initial singularity. This characteristic property
of the model plays a central role in BKL and in more recent approaches to the problem, and leads :
to formulations of the Einstein field equations as systems of partial differential equations where —
conjectures about the properties of the solutions have been formulated. In this paper, we follow [3
a simpler approach that focuses instead on the behaviour of the interaction of two neighbouring Dm
spatial points on approach to the singularity. Da

Our ensuing analysis applies to the Go cosmologies that admit no isometries and have a state that [8
is described in vacuum by the Hubble-normalized state vector [23], [3
