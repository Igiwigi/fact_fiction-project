These changes mean that the charge on the left hemisphere switches by
approximately 0.6e as the calcium atom moves between the two energy minima. The presence of
hydrogen atoms causes the carbon shell to become asymmetric during the optimization process;
an effect due primarily to a change in hybridization where those carbon atoms that are bonded to
hydrogen go from being sp* to sp*. More significant, however, is the fact that sp® carbon atoms
are much less electronegative than sp* hybrids. Interestingly, the charge maximum (—1.03e) in the
left hemisphere does not coincide with the energy minimum, but is reached at —0.75 A; however,
for the right hemisphere there is a much closer correspondence between charge maximum and
energy minimum. Figure 7 shows how charge on the fullerene cage responds to the formation of
[Ca@CgoH4]*.
