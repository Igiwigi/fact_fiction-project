WALLER ON ISOLATED NERVE. It will naturally be asked what significance belongs to these facts; what is their
dependence, if any, upon the strength and length of excitation in relation to state of
nerve, and whether there is any significant relation to be traced between an @ and an
deflection under various conditions, &c., &e. All these questions are difficult to
answer; the general question of significance will be considered by itself, other
questions of fact, to which owing to the number of variables I can only give
incomplete or fragmentary answers, may receive such answer at this stage. But,
whereas the more general statements heretofore made are presented as generalizations
resting upon a number of particular experiments considered as affording a broad
enough basis, the following are to be regarded almost in the light of particular
observations, which a more extended survey may (or may not) demonstrate to be
representative of general relations. Separate investigations of considerable extent
will be required before this conclusion may safely be arrived at.
