3 (i.) That fertility is inherited in the female line.

2 (ii.) That its effects are very largely screened by the factors to which we have
3 previously referred.

& Had we started with no limitation as to the daughter's family, it is highly probable
that 7. would scarcely have been sensible relatively to its probable error, and,
etherefore, small series without due regard to screening causes may easily lead the
Brecorder to suppose that fertility is not inherited.
3 Supposing we exclude from the daughters the 775 barren marriages, we find the
mean for 3643 cases of fertile marriages to be 5°237. Comparing this fertility with
Athe observed fertility 6-225 of mothers, a superficial inquirer might at once consider
that a diminution of fertility has taken place. The fact is that neither of the results,
M,, or M, gives the actual fertility of the mothers or daughters. These are the
means M”, and M”, of formule (viii.) and (vii.) of the theoretical investigation.
Let us apply the theory developed to our statistics. In the first place we note
_ that 7 is small ; hence 7” is still smaller, and thus by (xv.) o”, will not differ much
from o Since o”; will be generally less than o, by (xvi.), it follows that o”, will
probably be less than o:. Approximately, we can take o, = 8. Turning to (vii.) we
see that M”, cannot, since 7 is small, differ widely from M.. If there be no secular
