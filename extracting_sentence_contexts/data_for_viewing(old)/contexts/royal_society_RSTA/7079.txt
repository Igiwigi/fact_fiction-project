surface of the crystal.

In concluding this subsection we can say that the activity of a group of dislocations is in
general greater than that of a dislocation alone by a factor ¢, which in the case of a group of
dislocations of the same sign can be as great as the number of dislocations contained in it.

In any case, the distance y, between steps produced by the group, far from it, will be given
by their rate of advance »v,,, divided by the number of steps passing a given point per sec.:

ew/2n. Therefore, using (38),
Yo = 4,6. (45)

We shall see in § 10 that in spite of the fact that the activity of a group can be several times
greater than that of a single dislocation, the absolute value of the activity cannot surpass a
certain maximum, the reason being that the rate of advance decreases when the distance
between steps decreases.

9-2. General case

Suppose now we have any distribution whatever of dislocations in a crystal face, and a fixed
degree of supersaturation 7, and consequently a fixed value of p, (where o and p, may be
slowly varying functions of position on the face). We now make a formal grouping of the
dislocations. The first group consists of inactive pairs, all pairs of dislocations of opposite sign,
closer together than 2,. These have no activity by themselves, and their only effect, save in
exceptional cases when they may possibly fence off a region of the crystal face, and inhibit
