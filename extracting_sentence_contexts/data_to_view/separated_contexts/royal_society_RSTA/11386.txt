For curves (1)
and (4) the unit is 107” ampére, for (2) and (5) 1 = 107" ampére, and for (3) and (6)
1=107" ampére. The two leaks become equal at about 1230° C., though the
positive is far bigger than the negative at low temperatures. Although the negative ionisation increases far more rapidly than the positive, both
depend on the temperature in the same general kind of way; in fact, the positive
ionisation, so far as its temperature relations are concerned, obeys the law originally
