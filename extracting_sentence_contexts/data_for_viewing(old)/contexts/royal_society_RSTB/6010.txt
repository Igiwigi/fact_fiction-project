It has been proposed that this roominess of the molar pulp cavity (occurring wholly
in the corpus dentis without regard to the relation of the latter to the alveolar margin)
which is so evident in Sinanthropus, be termed megaphanic* in contrast to a microphanic
condition observed in modern anthropoids and man (Buack and others, 1933). New
terms are suggested. because there is evident need for some special name to describe a
condition, the probable significance of which heretofore has not been clearly recognized.
These terms have been used in this laboratory in the above sense for some time, since
no other unambiguous ones were known to us. â€˜Taurodontism could thus be defined
as a specialized extension of an earlier megaphanic condition to become that charac-
terizing Neanderthal man, while cynodontism would be a special microphanic condition
characterizing modern anthropoids and man.

Regardless of what term be used to describe the condition, the fact remains that in
this early and generalized hominid Sinanthropus, there is a roomy molar pulp cavity

which does not encroach upon the root zone but extends above the border of the
supporting alveolus (megaphanic condition). However, in the later hominid repre-
sentatives known to us, two very widely divergent conditions obtain (taurodontism
in the Neanderthaler and cynodontism in modern man), neither of which could well
be derived from the other.
