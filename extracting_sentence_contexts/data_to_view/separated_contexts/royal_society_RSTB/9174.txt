End nodes in the brain? Based on anatomical evidence, I have argued in the past [61]
that there is no end station in the cerebral cortex. This argu-
ment derives from the fact that all areas of the cerebral
cortex have anatomical inputs and outputs, and receive and
send signals. Consequently, there is no terminal station in
the cerebral cortex. While this remains true in terms of anat-
omy, it requires reformulating in perceptual terms.
