Motion of Eggs in Incubators.—-While collecting information as to the change of weight
of eggs during incubation it was noticed that the weighed eggs frequently hatched
better than the rest. The weighings were made every two days, and, as every egg in
each incubator was turned twice and cooled once each day, the weighed eggs received

most turning and cooling. Much of the difference between the hatching of weighed and
unweighed eggs was subsequently found to have been accidental, and was due no doubt
to the fact that the two sets of eggs did not “ correspond”; but by that time a study had
been begun of the separate effects on hatching of turning and cooling, and this has proved
fruitful, as the following account shows: All the eggs in each incubator were turned twice
and cooled once as usual, but at three other times during the day every alternate row
of eggs was turned additionally. In this way the eggs were all cooled alike, but half of
them were turned five times instead of twice. ‘The results are given in Table II., where
4 under the heading “ Eggs hatched” means that a chick was helped out, helping
only being resorted to in cases where the chick was all but out already.
