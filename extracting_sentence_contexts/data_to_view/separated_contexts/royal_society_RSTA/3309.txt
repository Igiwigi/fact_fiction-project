Observations of the logarithmic decrement of the oscillations of the unannealed tin
wire were made, and the results showed that the rate of increase of the logarithmic
decrement with temperature was much greater than in the case of the annealed wire. The heating of the unannealed wire greatly reduced the value of the logarithmic
decrement at the ordinary laboratory temperature. Some observations on the effect of increased amplitude of vibration on the
logarithmie decrement gave very irregular results, complicated by the fact that the
logarithmic decrement of a constant amplitude diminished as time went on. The
observations showed that the logarithmic decrement increased with the amplitude of
oscillation, but in a very irregular manner. Lead.
