As stressed above in the section Introduction, however, we leave this level of analysis out in
this context. While most of today’s debate on the impact of robots and AI agents on the laws
of war and, generally speaking, on tenets of criminal law concerns, e.g. the hypothetical ‘I-3’ of
table 1, current discussions on how AI robots may affect pillars of civil law mainly regard cases
‘I-1’ and ‘T-2’. Most of today’s disagreement on the civil status of AI robots has in fact to do with
either such AI robots as legal persons, or as accountable agents in the system, rather than simple
sources of damage and, hence, of human legal responsibility. Consequently, the focus of this paper
is, on the one hand, on the nine ideal-typical conditions of legal responsibility illustrated with
table 1, that regard the field of civil (as opposed to criminal) law. On the other hand, we have to
further restrict the focus of the paper on the first two sets of observables in table 1, thus skipping
such cases as ‘I-3’, ‘SL-3’ and ‘UD-3’.
