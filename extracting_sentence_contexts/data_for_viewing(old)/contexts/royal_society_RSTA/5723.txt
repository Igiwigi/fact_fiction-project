The results presented here help to inform how we can assess whether NDCs would lead to
achievement of the Paris temperature goal based on the best available science. If the assessment
of progress towards a temperature limit of 1.5°C above pre-industrial temperature (without
running a climate model) is the aim, then a metric which acts as a proxy for contribution


to temperature will be needed to accurately represent CH4. The use of conventional GWP100
hides progress towards the temperature goal, as the amount of warming generated by CO2e
emissions is ambiguous (e.g. [24,25,27]). The use of GWP20 reflects the integrated RF from a
CHy emission over the initial 20 years, compared to that of CO9, and is unsuitable for use
over time horizons further than 20 years. If an equivalence was to be placed on CHy and
COz based on GWP20, this would place a high value on reducing a CHy emission, despite the
fact that in the long term, the nominally equivalent CO2 emission would have a much greater
warming effect [28]. If a ‘net-zero’ scenario for all greenhouse gases were defined using GWP100
or GWP20, the temperature outcome would depend on the component gases (e.g. [9,60]). For
example, if ongoing CH, emissions were offset by COz removals, as is often assumed (e.g.
[27,61]) then maintaining this net-zero scenario would cause temperatures to decline over time—
after a couple of decades if using GWP20, and after a century if using GWP100 in the example
shown by Allen et al. [28]. If, however, CH4 removals were used to offset CO2 emissions, e.g.
as discussed in [62], then the temperature would increase while this net-zero scenario were

maintained in the long term (again, after a couple of decades if using GWP20 and after a : =
century using GWP100). This latter scenario, using GWP100 or GWP20, could be inconsistent : =
with the temperature goal of the Paris agreement, if the trend caused temperatures to exceed 1B
‘well-below 2°C’. 1
