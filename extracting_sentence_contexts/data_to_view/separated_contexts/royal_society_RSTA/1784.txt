There is an initial drop of intensity on IT. down this series, more pronounced in
the third member, which becomes weaker relatively to the second. The fact that
44144 is not visible on I. is readily interpreted, for on this photograph, the true
photographic intensity of \6678 is 6°25, so that 14144 would become invisible if its
intensity on the arbitrary scale of the last table were less than 16, which it may
readily be, by comparison with the remainder of the last table. After this initial drop, a remarkable enhancement takes place in 14388, which is
not confined to the last three photographs, and which cannot therefore be interpreted
as due to a difference in behaviour of the separate plate on which they were taken. The change is of a quite different order of magnitude from any change found in
Table V.

On the apparent law followed by the rest of the table, the true intensity of \4144
on IV. is found to be 1°2, which is in accordance with the fact that it is just visible.
