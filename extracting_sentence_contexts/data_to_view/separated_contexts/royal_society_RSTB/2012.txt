We see, therefore, that in every case the average values for the size
of ova and of larve more or less correspond ; but as the individual values show con-

iderable variations, there are obviously other factors at work as well. With reference to the two values for Echinocardiuny ova, it will be noticed that
that of E. mediterraneum is considerably less (10°7 per cent. in fact) than that of
E. cordatum, the five days’ plutei being also 11:2 per cent. less in body-length. Now

the extreme limit of variation in any of the other measurements of ova was only
8°9 per cent.
