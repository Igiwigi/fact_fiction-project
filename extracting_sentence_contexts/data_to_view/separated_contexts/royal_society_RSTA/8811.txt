This is very close to the mean of the 43000 shown in the table and a line
(4) 43019-17, ie., 43009-87. In other words, these two lines are (¢) (28;)Ss and (¢) (— 26,) Ss, indicating
that the normal Ss line has been split into two by displacements +26, on the limit (or + equal displace-
ments in sequent). Both linked lines are seen, but only one of the lines themselves, which is possibly
due to the fact that they are close on the limits of the observed region. We shall find indisputable
evidence of such displaced parallel series as a general phenomenon.

The separation —¢ is given on the value calculated from the formula, In m = 4 the observed is 2°6
larger than the calculated, pointing to too small a value for the limit, which is quite possible as the limit
determined from lines involving S(1) = —P(1) is never found correctly. An increase of this order
makes the —e link in $,(5) normal.
