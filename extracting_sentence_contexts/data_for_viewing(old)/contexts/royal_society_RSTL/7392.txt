k2se vessels were thus brought fairly into view, I never 8aw the slightest evidence of
optr raction in any part of their extent, neither could I detect any cilia in their interior ;
gy seemed to contain a clear fluid devoid even of suspended molecules. In the other
'enera named I have never een any approach to a convoluted arrangement of these
agral vessels, and they seem to pursue nearly a straight course. In the genus Plectus,
(Gvever, each seems to start from, and to be connected anteriorly by a short narrower
tion, with a circular marking (perhaps having a minute orifice in its centre) of the
pegument (Plate XXVIIL. fig. 14). This is all T have been able to ascertain concerning

82 structures, and it is from what I have seen in Tylenchus tritics only, that I have
Pn led to infer as a probability that the similar vessels met with in the other genera,
ney the same position in the general cavity of the body as I have proved them to do
nZthis gpecies. These four genera are further allied to one another by the fact that

y alone of the land and freshwater Nematoids yet discovered possess any modification
f the ventral gland before described, and that it exhibits essentially the same formation
k all the species of these four genera, whilst this formation differs s0mewhat from the
OmMMON type.

The other vessels in the Nematoids were, I believe, structures first noticed by
SCHNEIDERF in Ascaris lumbricoides, though neither at that time nor at the present}
loes he take this view of their nature. He is somewhat perplexed by them, but upon
be whole regards them rather as nerves than vessels. LEYDIG has also examined these
itructures, and believes them to be vessels—an opinion which I had, moreover, formed
»f them at a time when I was quite in ignorance of Levpl&'s views upon the subject.
