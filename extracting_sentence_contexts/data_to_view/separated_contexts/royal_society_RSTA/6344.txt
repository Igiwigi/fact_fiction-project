During the boreal summer, SEDI decreases across much
of central Europe, central Africa and much of Asia, indicating drier conditions. The standardized
P-ET, on the other hand, does not reinforce dry conditions when compared with the SPI. This
pattern is due to the fact that most of the regions with increased SPEI drought severity correspond
to areas where soil water limitations are present and ET is controlled by precipitation. As a
result, even though increased AED causes plants in water-limited regions to become more water
stressed, P-ET is unable to detect this response. The evolution of the percentage of the global area affected by severe, moderate and mild
drought based on different drought metrics on a three-month timescale shows no apparent trends
with the SPI and standardized P-ET (electronic supplementary material, figure S10).
