Hanxe observed that several' Charts! and: Books of Navi-
gation assert, that the tides from the North Sea and the
Channel, or the Eastern and Western tides, meet in the
vicinity of Dungeness. and Rye harbour ; and that, on such
authority, this opinion has been too generally adopted by
those, who have not had: the opportunity. or the inclination
of making personal observations ; as well as by the pilots
on this: part of the coast, who from being incapable, for the
most part, of making observations or deducing inferences
from facts | before them; readily embrace the first theory
they meet with in print, however erroneous or inconsistent ;

I have been induced to bestow all the attention in my power
to the phanomena of the tides between Fairleigh and the
North Foreland, and now venture to submit' the result of
my observations to: the notice of the Royal Society. From
having cruised constantly within these limits for nearly two
years and a half, I have had-many opportunities of making
observations ; but I must, nevertheless, profess my readi-
ness to admit any alteration or improvement which may be
Pointed out by those more conversant with the subject ; truth
alone being the object of my enquiries. MDCOCXIX.
