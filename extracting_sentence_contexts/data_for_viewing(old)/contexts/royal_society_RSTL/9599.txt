my experiments have proved the former of these two theories inadequate to explain
all the phenomena of rhythm as it occurs in the Medusze. For these experiments have
shown that even after the remoyal of the only ganglia which serve as centres of natural
sbimulation, the excitable tissnes still continue to manifest a very perfect rhythm under
the influence of any mode of artificial stimulation (except heat), which is of a constant
character and of an intensity sufficiently low not to produce tetanus. And as I have
proved that the rhythm thus artificially produced is almost certainly due to the
alternate process of exhaustion and recovery which I have explained, there can scarcely
be any doubt that in the natural rhythm this process plays an important part, parti-
cularly as we find that temperature and gases exert the same influences on the one
rhythm as they do on the other, And, as an additional reason for recognising the
part which the contractile tissues probably play in the production of rhythm, I have
pointed to the fact that in the great majority of cases in which rhythmic action occurs,
the presence of ganglia cannob be suspected. For it is among the lower forms of life,
where ganglia are certainly absent, and where the functions of stimulation and con-
traction appear to be blended and diffused, that rhythmic action is of the most frequent
occurrence ; and it is obvious with how much greater difficulty the resistance theory is
here beset than is the one which I now propose. Granted a diffused power of stimu-
lation with a diffused power of response, and I see no essential difference between the
rhythmic motions of the simplest organism and those of a deganglionated Medusa in
acidulated water,

But now, in conclusion, I wish it to be distinetly understood that I am not attempt-
ing to overturn, bub merely to snpplement, the current theory of ganglionie action.
My belief is that this theory is to a large extent a true one, but that in order to
