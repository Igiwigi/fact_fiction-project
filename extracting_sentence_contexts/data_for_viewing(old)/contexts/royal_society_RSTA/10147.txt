Thus we may go through all the equations of condition in turn.

In the more general case, where the roots of the equation for 6, fall into more than
one group of equal roots, the procedure is exactly similar.

For example, suppose that ,"%, @,"*"°**, ... are all different from zero. Then the
preceding work suggests that a solution may be found in which the first ¢ rows
proceed according to powers of ¢'", the next €, according to powers of ¢’, and so on.

The whole would thus be of normal form with the variable ¢*, k being the least
common multiple of «, &....

Tn fact, if we change the independent variable to ¢', k having this value, the matrix
Ay,-.+1 is identically zero, and the indices 6',,...0%, are the roots of — (4,,)"+0 = 0.

These roots are all equal, and the corresponding equations of condition are all
satisfied owing to the vanishing of the matrices other than A,,+1.

If, now, we form the equation for 6',,-1 we have
