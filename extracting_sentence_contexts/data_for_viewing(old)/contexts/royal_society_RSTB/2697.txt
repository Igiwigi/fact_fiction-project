422 DR. W. T. BLANFORD ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF

* except Calotes, the genera range throughout Burma to the hills south of Assam, and
only reappear in India in the neighbourhood of the Malabar coast. It will be shown
subsequently that this particular distribution may be connected with some peculiari-
ties in the Himalayan fauna.

Yet one more case of peculiar distribution deserves brief recognition. It is, of
course, a well-known fact that there are in the Indian Peninsula numerous
representatives of African animals. The majority of these, however, are forms like
Hyena, Mellivora, Gazella, amongst mammals ; Pterocles, Eupodotis, Phanicopterus,
amongst birds; Chameleon and Eryx, amongst reptiles—to quote a few well-known
examples only—and in these cases the Indian and African forms are connected by
species which inhabit South-western Asia and the Mediterranean area. Instances,
such as Golunda amongst mammals, Salpornis and Rhinoptilus amongst birds, of
genera only known in tropical Africa and India are much less common.

Now it is a noteworthy fact that there are a few genera or larger groups inhabiting
India, the nearest allies of which are found, not in Africa, but in tropical America.
There are several similar cases of a connection between the Eastern part of the
Indo-Malay region and the Neotropical, as in the case of the genus Tapirus, but the
