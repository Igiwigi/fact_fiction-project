.at first regarded as identical. Subsequently the species C. Casheana
hed for the heterosporous form. *
m the heterospory, there are some slight differences between the species.
}, Binneyana both bracts and sporangiophores stand out exactly at a right
the axis, in C. Casheana they seem to have been placed rather obliquely,
tly upwards. Further, in a tangential section of C. Casheana, passing
e sporangia, the bracts are beginning to separate from one another ;
ilar sections of C. Binneyana, they form a perfectly coherent disc. It
hen, that the coherent portion of the bracts did not extend so far in the
ous as in homosporous species (see Plate 74, photograph 15). These
. however, are very slight, and it is certainly a most striking fact that
early alike in general characters should exhibit so important a physiological
n as that between homospory and heterospory.
d specimen of C. Casheana, obtained from the Strinesdale Pit, Saddleworth,

ential (Plate 74, photograph 15), the other transverse (photograph 16). The

show macrosporangia only ; the intermediate whorl also contains a single
mrangium, which is borne on the same sporangiophore with three macro-
m (photograph 15, also Plate 82, fig. 38). The relative size of the microspores
fospores agrees exactly with that in the former specimen, 7.¢., the diameter of
spores is, on the average, just three times that of the microspores. The
