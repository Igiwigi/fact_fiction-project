The ontogenetic
development of the cervical flexure is completed at the close of the Sclerotogenous period,
when the embolomerous arrangement of elements obtains, so that the changes in habits
which affected the changes in the structure of the vertebral column mentioned above,
are possibly connected with the phylogenetic significance of this flexure. The connec-
tion between the development of the flexure and the formation of the highly modified
occipital region is a close one ontogenetically. That it is possibly also a close one
phylogenetically is the inference one draws from this fact. THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN IN MAMMALS. 161

Summary.

(1) Sclerotomic cells are liberated from the dorso-mesial portions of the primitive
somites. The notochord is very slender and is surrounded by loosely arranged mes-
enchymatous cells.

(2) Five rudimentary segments are seen in the anterior region of the embryo.
