Here again, as in the radius, the New Race approached the Negro. To judge from
TURNER'S measurements very considerable differences appear to occur in the value
of this index for different races, and this author is inclined to think that the relation
is too indefinite to form a race-character. Such we should expect from the highly
variable nature of the clavicle, in fact, the coefficient of variation of this bone is much
higher than that of any of the limb-bones.

(6.) The Radio-crural and Humero-crural Indices. The indices which I have so named, indicate that both the radius and the humerus
are longer in proportion to the femur + tibia in man than in woman. Below is a
table quoted from Toprnarp, and derived from the measurements made by Broca, on
some 9-15 skeletons, In the third column are inserted the indices for the New Race.
