vascular supply. The micropyle is tubular to the one, slit-shaped in the other. In
fact, the two things are in every respect different, the true Cardiocarpon being a
typical Gymnospermous seed, while the fructification of Lepidocarpon is, as we have
seen, the integumented megasporangium of a Lycopod. Carruruers’ C. anomalum,
like Bron@nrArt’s specimens, doubtless belonged to the Cordaitese. W1.t1Amson’s
Cardiocarpon anomalum, our Lepidocarpon, belongs to the Lycopodiaces, and has no
affinity with BRon@NrArt’s genus,

At present, Lepidocarpon stands isolated. Its reproductive bodies, as I have
endeavoured to show, present important analogies with true seeds, but there is
nothing to indicate affinity with any of the existing groups of Spermophytes. Those
who hold to the belief that the Gymnosperms, or a part of them, sprang from
Lycopods, may find in the discovery of Lepidocarpon some support for their views.
In spite of its seed-like organ, however, the new genus was a true Lycopod, and
