element p of the Lie algebra to the group G. Note that the bracket operation in the algebra can be
defined in a familiar way.

So one envisages that, when we are dealing with right invariant fields in a Lie group G, that
if there is a point of some representative structure at 0, then there are also points at e’, and by
iterating also at ee”, etc. So the relevant set of points is a subgroup of G.

Now the ‘crystallographic restriction’ which produces the perfect lattices of crystallography is
the requirement that iteration of certain symmetry operations produces a discrete set of points
(ie. a set of points with non-zero minimum pairwise separation). We adopt the analogous
requirement here, that the set of subgroup elements (as points of R°) be discrete. This restriction
is a strong requirement [19,20], which restricts the value of S, the composition function x and the
form of the Lie algebra g. In fact (with some technical assumptions) there are just three classes
of three-dimensional Lie groups that have discrete subgroups, according to Auslander et al. [19],
and I concentrate here on results available for just one of those classes. So take

where it turns out that jz must be a rational number and that the components of p € R° can be | 2 |

taken to be relatively prime integers, if there are to exist discrete subgroups D C G. One calculates
