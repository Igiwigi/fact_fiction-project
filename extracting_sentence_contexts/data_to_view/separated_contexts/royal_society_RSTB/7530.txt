And ona shorter time-scale, there are many cases where a decrease of wind speed
is followed by an increase of locusts flying (corresponding odd numbers on the figures) ; and
where an increase in wind speed is followed by a decrease of locusts flying (corresponding
even numbers). Thus the changes in activity level seemed to depend not so much on the
absolute wind speed as on changes in the wind speed, which often took effect in less than
a minute. The apparent failure, according to the records, of gusts always to reduce activity
instantly was partly due to the fact that although all the locusts responded to a gust, not all
