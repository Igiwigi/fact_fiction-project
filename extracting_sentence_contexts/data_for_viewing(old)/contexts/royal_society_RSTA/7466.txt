Notes. The entries under ‘theoretical’ are the values ofr calculated for 1/H = 0-65 x 10-*from (7). The values
of x required in the calculation were determined specially in the same experiment and found to be x = 0-50°K
at 4-22°K and x =0-62°K at 1-29°K; the 1-29°K value was used at 1-16°K. The values of the factor
cos (7pfq/)/cos (79/8) were 0-96, 0-88 and 0-78 for p=2, 3, 4 respectively. In analyzing the experimental
curves a small correction was applied to take account of the instrumental effect (finite twist of crystal) ; this
hardly affected the values of r but changed ¢, by a few degrees.

to inaccuracies of measurement; bearing this in mind the agreement with theory can be
considered as satisfactory. It should be noticed that in the various logarithmic plots dis-
cussed earlier the possible presence of harmonics was ignored; this is in fact fairly justified,

since even with r = 0-2, the peak to peak amplitude of the experimental curve differs by
only a few per cent from that of the fundamental, and the difference of the logarithms is
very small. It is, however, possible that some slight residual departures from linear plots
may be due to this neglect.

We may now consider the question of the representation of the Fermi surface by ellipsoids.
The simplest assumption consistent with the orthorhombic symmetry of gallium is a single
