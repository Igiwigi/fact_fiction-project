which occupies approximately the same position on the other side of the jaw is a split
off piece from the deep aspect of the mouth epithelium and it lies wholly separated
from the enamel organ, close to the epithelium lining the mouth cavity. It is not
comparable in position or structure with a typical nodule; it is far more like the
adventitious body described as “dx,” in H.P. A structure of such size, differentiation,
and importance as this dentinal nodule should be represented in some way in other
stages of development of the Platypus. I find nothing to correspond to it either in the
earlier specimens or in H.X. The only possible antecedent is an epithelial body in H.P.
which lies in a comparable situation and which is attached to the deep aspect of the
mouth epithelium (fig. 80, Plate 44); it only extends over two sections and is un-
represented in H.Q.or H.X. I am, therefore, forced to the conclusion that this dentinal
body is adventitious and is peculiar to the one side of the jaw in this particular specimen.
In further support of this is the fact that it is additional to the constant epithelial body
“*dy,”’, it does not replace the latter as might be expected if it were a further differentia-
tion of such a body.

The nodule “dy,” is present over the postero-medial cusp.

This specimen measured 295 mm. in length. According to BURRELL (1927), a foetus
of this size would have been nearly ready to leave the nest and would be approximately
