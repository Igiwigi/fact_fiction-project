If, however, at a shallower depth than that equivalent
to this point it was assumed that the velocity gradient started to decrease in value, then
it is possible to produce a calculated curve which would not increase its slope so rapidly
with decreasing distance and which could therefore have the required slope at a shorter
range. The existence of these five points is consequently an indication of a continuous
rather than discontinuous change in velocity gradient. No attempts have been made to
calculate a suitable time-distance curve of this type on account of the arithmetical com-
plexity and also on account of the fact that two extra parameters would be introduced,
the first to provide a law for the rate of change of gradient and a second to provide a point
from which this rate of change should begin. IN AN AREA OF THE EASTERN ATLANTIC 587

The arrivals for the three stations are shown in figures 6, 7 and 8. Table 8 gives the
observations, the slopes of the lines on which they lie, the residuals, and the intercepts of
the lines on the time axis.
