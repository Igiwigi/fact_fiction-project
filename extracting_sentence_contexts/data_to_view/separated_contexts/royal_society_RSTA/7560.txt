246 MARGERY NEWLANDS ON A LINE SOURCE

The possibility / — 0 is fully discussed later in connexion with the dispersive surface-
wave motion, and the conclusion reached that the formulation of the problem is only valid
for a source which is actually submerged.

(g) We have obtained a contribution corresponding to energy transfer from source to
observer by each one of the minimum-time paths given by the ray theory. Further, those
paths involving refraction at the critical angle (which on the simple ray theory are asso-
ciated with zero energy) are found in fact to correspond to finite disturbances. It is evident
from the way in which these results are arrived at mathematically that the corresponding
results hold

(i) for any values of the velocities,
(ii) if the source and/or the point of reception is in the lower medium,

(iii) if the system is multilayered and the source and reception point located in any
stratum. We may therefore deduce the exponents which must occur in the ¢ and y series in any
of these generalizations and hence the mathematical origin and, to some extent, the nature
of the diffraction effects.
