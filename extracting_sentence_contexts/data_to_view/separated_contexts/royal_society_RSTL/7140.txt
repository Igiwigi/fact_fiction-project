W. B. CARPENTER ON THE STRUCTURE, PHYSIOLOGY, AND

ilustration in the fact that LAMARCK, in the first edition of his © Systeme des Anima
sans Vertebres* (1801), ranged them, as Lixxnzvs had done, among his « Polypes
rayons coralligenes,” by the side of Forgonia, Umbellularia, and Pennatula; apparently
under the influence of the original suggestion of ELL1s, and of the erroneous surmise of
GvrrTaRD, who, however, nowhere goes $0 far as to affirm that the branching arms of
his * Palmier marin ” actually bear Polypes. Tt is not a little surprising that, with the
very specimen of the recent Pentacrinus Caput-Medus& described by GUeTTARD under
his eyes in the Museum at the Jardin des Plantes, LAMARCK $hould have failed to TCCOg»
nize its close relationship to Antedon, a type which, as we shall prescntly see, specially
attracted his attention. The first among post-Linnean zoologists who recognized the claim of this form of
Sea-star to a distinct generic rank, on account of that difference from all others in its
plan of structure which had been recognized by Linvyp and Lixck, seems to have been
