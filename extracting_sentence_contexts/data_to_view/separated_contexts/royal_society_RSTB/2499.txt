MARSHALL WARD ON THE HISTOLOGY OF

exhaustive paper* on the subject, and devoted one plate to illustrations of these
corpuscules spéciaux. Now, it may be at once stated that these “ corpuscules” occur
exactly as, and where, ErrKsson says they occur, but to my astonishment I
found the figures to represent certain bodies in the cells of infected plants, with
which I was—so I thought—perfectly familiar, and had figured so long ago as 1881
in another genus of Rust-fungi.t Errkssoy’s figures represent such organs in an
imperfect form, the necks connecting them with the hyphe, as well as the latter
themselves, being wanting, as indeed are all details regarding the cell-contents also,

In other words, ErrKsson’s figures conveyed to my mind the impression of
haustoria, the attaching necks of which had been cut off, or hidden, or not seen by
him. If this is so, he has entirely misunderstood the significance of the facts, and
has read the sequence of events backwards. His whole contention turns upon this. Before passing to the discussion of this question, however, it will be advisable to
examine Errksson’s position somewhat more in detail.
