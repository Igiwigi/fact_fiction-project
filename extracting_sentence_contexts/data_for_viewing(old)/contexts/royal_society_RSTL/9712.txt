In the © Philosophical Magazine' for 1868 CavLey gave the four particular integrals
P,, Qs, Ry, S, ($1IT.) of Rrccamr's equation (4); and in the same journal for 1872
I investigated the relations between these four particular integrals and the well-known
particular integrals U,, V,, The results are the same as those given in FILL, and the
method is similar to that employed im $1. I afterwards found that the process of
obtaining and connecting the particular integrals assumed a much more simple form
when the differential equation was taken to be (1) than when it was (4); and it
seemed degirable to re-write the whole investigation, taking (1) as the differential
equation. This investigation forms $T.; it is similar in every respect to that contained
in the * Philosophical Magazine,” but is much more complete. The corresponding
results for the equations (3) and (4) are deduced in { III.

The fact that, in the solution in series of a differential equation, if the series
terminates but when continued recommences, the latter portion as well as the finite
series satisfies the differential equation, was pointed out by CavyLEy in the * Mezzenger
of Mathematics' for 1869.

The formula (8) of $ V. was published in the * British Ass0ciation Report” for 1872,
with a brief account of the process given in arts. 20, 21, The principal portion of two

short papers, © On Riccarr's Equation” and © On certain Differential Equations allied
to Ricoatr's,” which were published in the * Quarterly Journal of Mathematics' for
1871 and 1872, are incorporated in $ VI.

The memoir thus includes the results contained in several scattered notes and
