Sepresent one pair? If only one pair, then do the oral papillz represent the second ?
n these questions appears to depend the homology of the mesially indented line
howing a ridge stretching between the bases of the oral papille. This, if the oral
apille are homologous with the foot-jaws of Scolopendra, represents the second under
Yip of that animal, which is formed of the fused sternal and episternal plates of the
Segment to which the foot-jaws belong, and is slightly notched anteriorly as here.

In the present state of our knowledge concerning the structure of Peripatus, the
most remarkable fact is the wide divarication of the ventral nerve-cords. The fact was
considered remarkable and dwelt upon in all mention of Peripatus before the exist-
ence of trachee in the animal was known, and when it was thought to be herma-
phrodite, but it is doubly remarkable now. The fact shuts off at once all idea of
Peripatus being a degenerate Myriopod, the evidence against which possibility is over-
whelming. The bilateral symmetry and duplicity of the organs of the body, the
absence of striation in the muscles, the absence of periodical moults of the larval skin
