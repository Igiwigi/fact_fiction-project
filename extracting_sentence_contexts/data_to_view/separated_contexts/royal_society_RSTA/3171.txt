Eventually, it seems that some of the coefficients
of this formalism (called SME) may be constrained for the first time by future experiments of
trapped antihydrogen. I still believe that the proper calculation of the effects of the SME (including
the antimatter contribution) in the nucleons would also allow one to test these coefficients with
experiments involving pure matter fields. Concerning the bounds coming from the fact that scalars and vectors couple to different
bilinears (WW and Wy"W), one can also find new possibilities if Lorentz invariance is broken. For instance, a scalar can effectively be coupled to x,Wy"W Â« Wy. Besides, the kind of forces
mediated by bosonic fields around background values depending on space or time can be
different from the standard ones; see [36] for an example with scalar fields.
