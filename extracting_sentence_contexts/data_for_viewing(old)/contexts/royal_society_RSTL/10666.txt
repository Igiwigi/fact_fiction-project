From these expressions it may be 8een that the game benzenoid grouping is common!
to all, and the narcotine and oxynarcotine stand to each other in the relationship of
aldehyde and acid as far as this grouping is concerned.

In attempting to trace a connexion between the absorption spectra and the formulas -
given above, one is met by a difficulty caused by the large number of oxygen atoms
in the molecules, and particularly in those portions which have hitherto yielded n0
clue to their constitution. The difficulty is due to the fact that carboxyl and com
groups on side-chains, or as forming a portion of the substituted benzene nuclei exhibit
great absorptive power. The occurrence of several oxidised radicals may cause the
following variations in spectra : («), the absorption bands become 80 widened as to
extend into the region of rays affected by naphthalene, quinoline, and their deriva- |
tives; (b) or the absorption is 80 powerful that it extends to rays less refrangible than

ose in which the band is situated, and continues s0 far down the curve that the
elective absorption is nob made manifest. Narevine appears to be a good example of
this; its absorptive power is very great, extending into the region of such low
