diapause, and the present work has indicated several ways in which this influence may be
exerted. By this means the phenomenon of diapause, in its many aspects, may be explained
without resort to conceptions of excretory intoxication, hormone deficiencies, growth
inhibitors, etc. This is, admittedly, a very simple explanation of diapause, but it will be
elaborated further here in an attempt to explain the results obtained in these experiments.

High temperatures during the development of the parent female or a sudden rise in
temperature on emergence tend to decrease the percentage of Spalangia progeny entering
diapause. With Cryptus a diet that is deficient in protein and has excess energy-producing
sugar induces the formation of eggs very few of which give rise to larvae which enter
diapause. Either of these effects would raise the level of physiological activity and metabolic
rate of the parent female. Senility, on the other hand, would be expected to slow down
physiological activity and decrease the metabolic rate of the female, and, in fact, oviposition
rate decreases with age. Correlated with this there is an increase in the proportion of the
eggs laid which produce progeny going into diapause. Certain apparently similar effects
have been shown by Schmieder (1933, 1939) but are seen on analysis to be due to different

causes. He found (Schmieder 1933) that Melittobia chalybii Ashm., a gregarious parasite of
Trypoxylon, Sceliphron, etc., occurred in two separate types, one a form in which dispersal of
the species occurred, the other, progeny of the first type within individual host cells, acting
as a means of increasing reproductive rate. A first type female stings a host within its cell,
feeds at the punctures and oviposits. The first few eggs she lays produce rapidly-developing
