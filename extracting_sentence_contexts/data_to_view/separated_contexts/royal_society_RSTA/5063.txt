Investigations on
the use of synthetic jet actuators [16], microtabs and trailing edge flaps [17,18] have also been
considered by researchers. Active control strategies have been proposed by Staino et al. [19]
and Fitzgerald et al. [14]. The control hardware takes advantage of the fact that the structure
of the blade is hollow in nature. This allows controllers to be installed inside the blade without
affecting the external aerodynamic characteristic of the blades and hence does not interfere with
aerodynamic performance. By exploiting the space available in the blade, Staino ef al. [19] have
proposed an active tendon controller and Fitzgerald et al. [14] have proposed an active tuned mass
damper (ATMD) for control of the vibration of blades.
