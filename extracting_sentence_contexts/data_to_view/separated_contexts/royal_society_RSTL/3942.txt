It was noticed in the same com-
Skitnleation; that the regular diurnal variation of each of the three magnetic obser-
Svation-elements at Toronto and Hobarton, the Declination, the Horizontal Force and
EtheVerticalForce, and of each of the two derived elements, the Inclination and the Total
S Force, exhibited evidences of a corresponding periodical inequality in the amplitude
8.or extent of the diurnal variation, the years 1843 and 1848 being also epochs re-
= gpectively of minimum and maximum. The observations of one of the elements (the
£ Declination), extending uninterruptedly at both stations over eleven entire years, or
& from 1841 to 1851 inclusive, distinctly pointed out 1848 as the year of maximum as
S well as 1843 as the year of minimum. This discovery of the existence of a periodical inequality, common to the magnetic
& disturbances of larger amount, and to those more regular diurnal magnetic variations

of which the sun has been long recognized as the primary cause (inasmuch as they
conform systematically to laws depending on solar time), was regarded as affording
presumptive evidence of the subsistence of a causal connexion common to those two
classes of phenomena, which presumption was corroborated by facts adduced in the
£ame communication, proving that the disturbances are themselves subject, on the
average, to a well-marked diurnal period, which is also regulated by solar time. The periodical inequality thus manifested, having its opposite phases of maximum
and minimum separated by an interval of five years, and of which the cycle might
therefore be conceived to include about ten of our solar years, did not appear to
connect itself with any of those divisions of time with which we are conversant as

depending upon the relative circumstances of the sun, and the earth and her satel-
lite. The cycle might or might not be one of regular and unfailing recurrence,
"The observational evidence to which we are indebted for a knowledge of its exist-
ence, though sufficiently decisive as far as the period of observation extended, could
only be viewed, in reference to a permanently cyclical character of the phenomenon,
as fragmentary, and as the commencement of an investigation which would require
to be pursued in one or more of the permanent magnetic observatories established in
our own and other countries.
