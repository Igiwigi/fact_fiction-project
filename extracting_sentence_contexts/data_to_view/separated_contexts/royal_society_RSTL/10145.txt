The external diameter of each layer was measured necessarily before the layers
external to ib were wound on. There will probably be a tendency in each layer to
compress those below it, and thus to make the mean radius of the coil s0mewhat less
than we have assumed. In fact, Lord RayLmGn found in his experiments (Phil. Trans., Part I., 1882) that
the value of the mean radius oblained from measurements made as the coil was
D unwound was less by 1 in 2000 than that obtained from the measurements made
while winding. Several reasons lead us to believe that any effect of the kind would be mnch less
with our coils.
