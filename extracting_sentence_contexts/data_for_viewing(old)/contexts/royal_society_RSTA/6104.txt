explaining how this quantity is used to construct concurrence networks as those of figure 1.

4. Bulk, edge and symmetry near the quantum phase transition

We start our analysis of the weighted structure of the state by making use of two local measures:
strength and disparity, which we depict for each spin in the chain in figure 3a,b. It can be
appreciated that, close to the critical point B=1 (k=0), the local (single-spin) distribution of
concurrences is very homogeneous and, moreover, the disparity is essentially constant along
the chain. At the same time, the strength curve reveals that pairwise entanglement is much
stronger for central spins than for those at the ends of the chain. This behaviour can be
related to the fact that, for finite systems, factorization starts from the edges, as shown in [59],
resulting hence in zero strength at the boundaries progressively increasing when moving into
the bulk. This means, together with the fact that the graph is fully connected (all degrees are
equal to N — 1), that concurrences are actually heterogeneously distributed across the system.
Yet, these weights are allocated in such a way that all relative fluctuations at the local level,
quantified by the disparity, are equal. This indicates a high level of symmetry in the state right
before the quantum phase transition, namely, that the single-spin distributions of concurrence
may be very similar for all spins in the chain when appropriately rescaled; this is indeed
confirmed in figure 3d. From the network point of view, this suggests that the weights can
be written as w= cj; for some local variables {a;}: in such a case, the weights of the links
intersecting node i rescaled by their mean value, s;/dj, are oi (Cigi @1/di) =(N — 1)aj/ Digi ay
(N — 1)oy/ >) a7, hence approximately independent of i. In fact, in the k = 1 concurrence network,
aj = 2 sin(iz/(N + 1))/V/N +1.

As the magnetic field is decreased (and k increases), we observe the appearance of k—1
