niceſt Hygrometer, that has ever yet been uſed, and1Iam
ſure is as cheap and plain as any. : 2

One of the grand defects of moſt (indeed I think of all,) ©
Hygrometers hitherto invented is, that they. 'grow-weak
with age, and do not ſo nicely obey the alterations of the
Air, when long kept, as when firſt made; Planks and
Boards grow more ſeaſoned, and 1 beleive Oat-Beards
will perilh with time; but whether our preſent Inven-
tion be ſubject to the {ame fault, I leave to-time to deter-
mine; in the mean while, give me leave to; propoſe a
reaſon which induces me to conjecture probably it will
not have this defect; for our Cord performs its motion
as it iz a plyable ſoft ſcrew, and that not only in its grol-
ſer-partor ftrands, but even inits ſmalleſt threads; as long
azever this contexture ſcrew-wiſe dos laſt (and this cer-
tainly muſt laſt whilſt 'tis a Rope,) the motion that re-
ſults therefrom muſt neceſſarily laſt, for the particles of
moiſture will inſinuate - themſelves, and- twiſt up the”
{crew. But this I offer only as a.conjeCture, for love to
conclude nothing in natural Philoſophy , trill matter of
fact and experiment confirm it. ;

There remains one thing to be obſerved of this Hygreſ-
cope (or Weatherclock ; as an eaſier name to ſatisfy La-
dys, that enquire what it is, as it hangs up in a Room,)
that which. Lhave deſcribed I have in-my Cloſet, and T
obſerve that the alterations of the zr that have happen-
ed in this rime have given it more then one turns now

"this being inconvenient, and the Duplication of the
turn hard tobe regiſtred, as Mr, Hook propoſes in his
Micrography pag. 150.
