coronagraphic occultation of the bright disc becomes necessary. This region also tends to coincide with the main ‘acceleration
region’ of the solar wind.


Measured kinetic temperatures of both O+° and Mgt? ions are greater than ‘mass-
proportional’ when compared with protons, with Tj /Tp > mi/Mp. These conditions are
reminiscent of the predicted properties of ion cyclotron resonance in a collisionless plasma.
Thus, the UVCS results helped to drive a resurgence of interest in this mechanism in the
fast wind (e.g. [94-97]).

2. UVCS line profile measurements in coronal holes also led to the conclusion that the fast
solar wind is accelerated closer to the Sun than was believed in prior decades. This kind of
determination is made possible by the fact that resonantly excited lines undergo ‘Doppler
dimming’, i.e. they are sensitive to motions transverse to the line of sight and thus mostly
parallel to the off-limb magnetic field. Strachan et al. [98] used sounding rocket data to
infer a supersonic speed (v ¥ 200 km s~! at r*2 Ro) for protons in a coronal hole. UVCS
then made it possible to determine that the outflow velocity for O* ions grows even

faster than the outflow velocity for protons. By r~ 3-3.5 Ro, the heavy ions are flowing : =
faster than the ‘bulk’ solar wind by as much as a factor of two [87,92,93,99]. : Sy
3. In polar coronal holes, the densest concentrations of bright plumes are seen to have higher a
densities, lower temperatures and lower outflow speeds than the dimmer ‘interplume’ aed
regions (e.g. [87,100,101]). Many impulsive polar jets have similar properties to the longer 22
lived plumes [102]. However, there may be observational selection effects at work, since : Ss
the UVCS counterparts to jets first identified by Hinode at X-ray wavelengths seem to DNS
