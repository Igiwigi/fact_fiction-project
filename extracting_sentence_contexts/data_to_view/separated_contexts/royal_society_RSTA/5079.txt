Below 24 K,
Cu3Nb2QOg spins order with helicoidal magnetic structure of the most general kind. Johnson et al.
demonstrated that the direction of polarization in Cu3Nb2QOg is inconsistent with the cycloidal
mechanism and proposed a new ‘ferroaxial’ mechanism that couples with the chiral component
of the magnetic structure. It is noteworthy that Cu? ions in this compound have $ = } The fact
that such detailed information could be extracted in a system with such low spin using non-
resonant scattering is a remarkable testimony to the quality of the data produced by the Materials
and Magnetism beamline (116). Resonant soft X-ray diffraction (RSXD) is another powerful tool to study multiferroics,
although, in the case of transition metal oxides, its applicability is limited to materials where
magnetic Bragg peaks are present in the Ewald sphere accessible at the L723, M45 or O K-edge
resonances [43]. Nevertheless, significant insights have been obtained using RSXD [4446], and



RSXD is also an area of active interest for Diamond theorists [47-50].
