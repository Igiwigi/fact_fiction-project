were induced to undergo the changes by a little agitation, and, “had
the agitation been more violent or more prolonged, similar experiments on other eggs proved that the
proportion would have been increased.” In my Millport experiments, the ova when taken from healthy
specimens near the period of ripeness matured spontaneously without further shaking than that involved
in the method employed (p. 224). Other facts show, however, that shaking does increase the kinetic
activity of the starfish egg ; for instance MATHEWS was able by its means to increase the number of ova
which underwent spontaneous or parthenogenetic development (LOEB, 50, p. 144). Fertilisation.—Normally, only a single spermatozoon enters the egg, and it may do
so at any point on the circumference. It proceeds towards the centre of the egg,
and then towards the egg nucleus, with which it becomes united.
