Trans.,’ A, vol. 229, p. 45 (1930). 180 J. E. SEARS AND H. BARRELL ON DETERMINATIONS OF FUNDAMENTAL

of the preliminary measurements made with the apparatus with which these deter-
minations have been carried out. The value in air at 15°C. shows a difference at
0-0006 x 10 19M. This is presumably due to the fact that the condition of the air
was not precisely ascertained in the preliminary experiments. It must be remembered
that the preliminary and final measurements depend on two entirely independent line
standard determinations, the former being based on a comparison of the N.P.L. nickel
bar No. 184 with the working standards of the Bureau in 1922, and the latter on a
comparison with the British National Copy of the Metre No. 16. ;

Had the results of the present determinations been calculated on the basis of the
1933 comparison of the British Metre No. 16 at the Bureau International (see Appendix
TI, p. 213) the value in “standard” air would have been reduced to 6438-4700 x
10 2° M, which is still nearer to the Benoit-Fapry-Prror result, and also to the mean
result of all observers. The refractive index for the red radiation of cadmium derived from the provisional
measurements was 1-000,276,45, for air at 15° C. containing an assumed normal amount
of carbon dioxide.
