Still, there seems .
to be a puzzle: in (2.5), we have shown that the interaction part of the fermion determinant
contributes strictly positively to the scalar potential. As the top-fluctuations dominate near the
lower bound, how can a second deeper minimum be generated? In fact, for microscopic actions with Â¢* bare potentials, this is not possible provided we start
from a well-defined functional integral requiring 42,4 > 0. This is illustrated at the mean-field
level in figure 3a for our simple Yukawa model, where the blue long-dashed line denotes the
bare potenial with a mass parameter fixed such that the effective potential (solid black line) has a
proper single Fermi minimum at v ~ 246 GeV (not well visible on this scale), and 2,4,43,4,---=
0. The red short dashed line denotes (minus) the fermion determinant which at the mean-field
level needs to be subtracted from the bare potential to yield the effective potential.
