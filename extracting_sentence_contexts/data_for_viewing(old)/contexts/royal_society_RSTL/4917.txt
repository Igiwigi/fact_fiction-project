having a quantity of fine dark granules surrounding them in a circular form. There
are also observed many nucleated vesicles, rather larger than the hlood-corpuscles,
the nuclei in which are circular, whilst the cavity of the vesicle contains also a few
small pale granules. Some small masses of reddish brown granules may also be ob-
served ; they exist, however, very sparingly. From the time when the formation of
the arteries supplying the organ is completed, up to that when the splenic vein is
observed to be also constituted, these latter elements not only form a portion of the
pulp, but are in fact its chief components. When, however, the splenic vein is nearly
completed, a considerable change is observed to have occurred in the nucleated
vesicles; those which had previously formed only a small portion of its substance,
Pow exist as the chief element, and the majority contain a nucleus with irregular
Bnargins. Their form is chiefly circular, their outer wall in some cases very distinct,
2n others less 80, from the cell being distended with dark granules. There is gene-
Samy only a single nucleus, which has a dark onter margin, and contains either a

ucleolus or two or three granules. In some the nucleus is of an irregular form, and
Inore indistinct ; the cavity of the cell in these cases containing a few granules, as
Zhe nuclei become more irregular and granular; these granules increase until at last
'Me nucleus appears to be entirely broken up, when they all become crowded with
mall granules. Such is the structure the pulp tissue of the spleen presents, from
