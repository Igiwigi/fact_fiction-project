Corresponding to the space-frequency distributions the actual fields or micro-states
will also naturally fall into two groups, namely: (a) one consisting of all fields or micro-states
___ for which the corresponding space-frequency distributions of u,,{Gr(np)} are indistinguishable
from the abstract distribution; and (b) all fields or micro-states for which the corresponding
space-frequency distributions have to be considered statistically different from the abstract
distribution. All fields falling in class (a) are now defined as fields of a random type, and all
fields falling in class () as fields or micro-states of a non-random type. Without entering
into the details of the procedure for such classification it is sufficient for the present purpose
to point out that, as a matter of empirical fact, fields observed in nature have often been
% found to be of a non-random type as defined above. Further, it is possible to construct
Â© fields or micro-states for which the corresponding space-frequency distributions are clearly
2 different from the corresponding abstract distribution. g Mean values and variance
