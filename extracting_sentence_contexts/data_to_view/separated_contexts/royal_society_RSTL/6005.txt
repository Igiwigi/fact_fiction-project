S In glass globes generally, the upper half of the sphere @, 6, C (fig. 6) is the most
Spherical, and is approximately uniform in thickness, being however thinnest at b, and
Z thickening gradually downwards towards the stem, the lower half («, d, c) being consider-
Qably the strongest. Hence it happened, in several cases (in fact in every Case in which
the point could be determined with certainty from the condition of the fragments), that
the globes ruptured first at 6, the lines of fracture radiating in every direction, passing
round the globe as meridians of longitude, and splitting it up into thin bands, varying from
2th to 4th inch in width. Tn the case of some elongated ellipsoids, it appeared that
the fractures occurred horizontally, or perhaps obliquely, from the condition of the frag-
ments attached to the stem. In most cases, however, it was not clear from the frag-
ments which had been the direction of the fracture, although the mode of rupture was
*the same in every Ccase.
