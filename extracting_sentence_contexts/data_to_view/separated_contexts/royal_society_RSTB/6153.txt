Ventrally it is in contact with the ventral
medullary lamina, laterally with the lateral medullary lamina which separates
it from the reticular nucleus, while medially it is separated from the centre median
nucleus by the pars arcuata or, in caudal planes, by an element of the pulvinar
(nucleus fu of FRIEDEMANN). Dorsally the pars externa merges with an element
of the lateral nucleus of the thalamus (nucleus Z/) from which it is separated by no
well-defined boundary. Nucleus LA is to be distinguished on the whole by the fact
that its cells are smaller, less deeply stained, and less densely arranged than those
of the pars externa of the ventral nucleus. Moreover, no fibres of the fillet system
have been demonstrated to reach the lateral nucleus. The cells of the pars externa are large and polygonal, deeply stained, and with
many branching processes.
