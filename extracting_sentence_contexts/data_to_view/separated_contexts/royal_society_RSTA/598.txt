Only then can
we define patterns required for information-driven interactions—such interactions cannot occur
at the non-decohered quantum level, and pragmatic information cannot exist and operate in, or be
extracted from, the quantum domain. A logical consequence is the so-called no-cloning theorem: a
single quantum system in a superposed state cannot be copied, unless the original is destroyed
in the process. It is an experimental fact that macroscopic bodies are in decohered and reduced
states (no Schrédinger cats!), but so are also the atomic nuclei of organic molecules.!® The latter
behave classically and can carry, transfer or respond to pragmatic information: a spatial pattern
in some complex organic molecule triggering a specific change in some other molecular system,
with some organelle responsible for the interaction mechanism, is possible! The above shows that in the physical Universe we can identify quantum and classical domains,
separated by a fuzzy transition boundary controlled by the physical process of decoherence. We
have shown that pragmatic information cannot be defined in the quantum domain, so its existence
or validity, too, has a lower limit given by the quantum-classical transition.
