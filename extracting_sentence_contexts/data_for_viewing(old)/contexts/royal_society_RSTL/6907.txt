Thirdly, I shall solve the general differential equation by definite integrals.

Fourthly, T shall determine the arbitrary constants of the solution 80 as to express
the mth power of that real root of the proposed algebraic equation which reduces to 1
when a©=0,

The differential equation which forms the chief subject of these investigations certainly
occupies an important place, if not one of exclusive importance, in the theory of that
large class of differential equations of which the type is expressed in (3). At present, I
am not aware of the existence of any differential equations of that particular type which
admit of finite solution at all, otherwise than by an ultimate reduction to the form in
question, or by a resolution into linear equations of the first order. It constitutes, in
fact, a generalization of the form
