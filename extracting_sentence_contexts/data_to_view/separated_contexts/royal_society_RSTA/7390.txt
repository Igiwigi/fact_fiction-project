On the other hand,
these trials should not be considered just as attempts to improve the particular energies
and wave functions concerned, they have provided very valuable experience in the
organization of such converging calculations, and would make any repetition or extension
much briefer. This is probably of more permanent value than the particular data. In view
of the above considerations and the fact that the present calculations for the first time
include electronic correlation for Na*, Ne, F~, it appears that the wave functions given in
table 2 are the most accurate available for these ions. The wave functions obtained correspond to a variational calculation with a finite number
of terms, but the process used is such that it can be extended without any fresh type of analysis
to any number of terms when it will converge to the accurate solution of the many electron
Schr√©dinger equation. One of us (M.J.M.B.) wishes to thank the Department of Scientific and Industrial Re-
search for a maintenance grant and the University of London for the award of a post-
graduate studentship, and a research grant which covered the expenses of the professional
computation of many of the integrals required.
