Acidity of the medium
had no effect. Only one-half of the absorbed gelatine could be removed by long
treatment with boiling water. This fact seems to indicate clearly that most of the
gelatine had been taken up during growth and had become embedded in the crystal. When precipitates of bromide free from colloid were placed in contact with gelatine
solutions of stated concentrations, much higher adsorptions were found, tending to a
limit of, roughly, 3% in a solution containing about 10°%, of gelatine. This high
adsorption by the preformed crystals is difficult to understand when compared with
the results given here, but may be explained according to Suzpparp by the much
finer grain of the colloid-free bromide.
