From these circumstances I am led to believe that
some degree of motion will ultimately be observed to mark the perfect condition of
the impregnating agent in all animals. The facts already mentioned coincide with
this view, and point to the probability that the degree of impregnating force in each
individual may perhaps be indicated relatively by the degree or intensity of motion
in the spermatozoon, and the duration of this force by the length of time which the
spermatozoon continues in motion. The established fact, that a difference in the structural conformation of a body is
the invariable result of a difference in the relations, proportions, and composition of
its material constituents, has always afforded reason for presuming that some material
influence may be transferred from the substance of the spermatozoon to the contents
of the oyum, at the time of impregnation. The function of impregnation appears to
be one of definite relations and proportions. Thus we have seen, when only a few
spermatozoa were applied to the ovum on the point of a pin, that full impregnation
was but rarely effected.
