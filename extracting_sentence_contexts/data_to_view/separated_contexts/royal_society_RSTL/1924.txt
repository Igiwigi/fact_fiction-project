58 Mr. Cur1sTIE on the effects of temperature on

intensity increased until about six o'clock in the afternoon,
after which time it appears to have decreased during the

these phenomena. The circumstance of the situation of the magnetic pole in what
appears to be, independent of elevation, the coldest region of the globe, supported
as it is by the fact of a diminution of temperature causing an increase of magnetic
intensity, would lead us to infer, that the effect produced by the sun is principally
to be attributed to the heat developed by it; but should any periodical effects,
corresponding to the time of the sun's rotation about its axis, be observable in the
diurnal variation, we must suppose that the sun, like the earth, is endued with
magnetism, and look for a cause of this magnetism, common to all the planets,
Being engaged more than two. years ago in making some experiments on the effects
produced on the needle by unpolarized iron, I discovered that a peculiar polarity
was imparted to the iron by simply making it reyolve about” an axis; and this
naturally suggested the question to me, whether the magnetism of the earth, and
consequently, that of the other planets and the sun, might not be owing to their
rotation? From the effects which I have observed to be produced on iron by its
rotation, it appears probable, if the magnetism of these bodies be not caused by
their rotation, that at least the effects will be modified by, and, to a certain extent,
dependent on such rotation. Since first observing the fact, that simple rotation
will cause a peculiar polarity, if I may be allowed the expression, in iron, I have
made a great variety of experiments on the subject, which haye enabled me to trace
the laws according to which this polarity in the iron affects a magnetic needle,
independently of the effect ,produced by the mass.
