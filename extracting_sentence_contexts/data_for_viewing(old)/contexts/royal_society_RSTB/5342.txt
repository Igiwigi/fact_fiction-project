to the formation of the dorso-lateral part of the definitive cartilaginous vertebral body.
Exactly the same occurs, according to ScuAurNsLAND, in Hatteria, when the “* Bogenbasen ”
fuse and cover the dorso-lateral aspect of the “ primiirer Wirbelkérper ” and thus give rise
to the formation of the “ sekundiirer Wirbelkérper ” of Gorrre and ScHAUINSLAND.

In Hatteria the middle and dorsal portions of the basi- and inter-dorsals also undergo
fusion and furnish the neural arch, although there remains between them a slight super-
ficial groove, even after the ossification of the arch, indicating the double origin of the
latter. In Struthio and Larus the fusion of the basidorsals with the dorsal-interdorsals
and interdorsals is much more complete, even in the cartilaginous stage.

The similarity in the evolution of the vertebra in Hatteria and birds is accentuated by
the fact that, as in Larus and Séruthio, there is also in Hatteria a stage in the development
of the neural arches where the upper ends of the successive neural arches become coales-
cent, so that the whole system of these arches on each side of the neural cord appears
in the form of a series of vault-like formations enclosing the spinal ganglia. The single
difference is that in Hatteria the temporary coalescence of the upper ends of the neural
arches occurs in the cartilaginous stage, whilst in Larus and Struthio it comes about in
the late prechondral stage. In Larus and Struthio, as in Hatteria, the temporary union
of the neural arches is very soon broken, the zones of union being transformed into the
incipient articular faces and ligaments between the posterior and anterior zygapophyses
of successive vertebrae.

SCHAUINSLAND (1906, p. 532) identifies the intercentra with the basiventrals, and the
latter with the “ hypochordalen Spangen”’ of Frormep. From the above discussion of the
