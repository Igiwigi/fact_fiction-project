It is also important to find that the distribution of the sensory impairment
after section of the inferior peduncle is the same as after ablation of one lateral
half of the cerebellum,

Important as are many of the results that have already been discussed, none are
more important, and few as interesting as those obtained on comparing the electrical
excitability of the two cerebral hemispheres after section of one inferior peduncle, or
after partial hemisection of the medulla. From the increased excitability of the
cortex of the opposite cerebral hemisphere met with after ablation of one lateral half
of the cerebellum, I concluded that the one half of the cerebellum normally exercised
a control on the opposite cerebral cortex ; it is therefore gratifying to find this view
further supported by the results now under discussion. The fact that with all the
cerebellar centres intact, and with the paths by which impulses may pass to the
cerebral hemispheres also intact, section of one inferier peduncle of the cerebellum is
followed by a lesser degree of excitability of the cortex of the opposite cerebral
hemisphere, as compared with that of the hemisphere on the same side, suggests the
possibility that the influence of control exerted on the opposite cortex by the half of
the cerebellum whose inferior peduncle is divided, is heightened by the taking-off of
some afferent inhibiting influence, normally acting on this half of the cerebellum,
and reaching it by way of the inferior peduncle,

This view is strengthened by the remarkable results obtained by the intravenous
injection of absinthe in animals in whom the same lesions had been previously
produced. That with the pyramidal system absolutely intact from the cortex to the

spinal centres, and that with the path from these to the muscles of the fore-limb on
the side of the divided cerebellar peduncle also intact, there should be an entire
absence of contraction of the muscles of this fore-limb, at a time when all the other

muscles of the animal are engaged in the general convulsions, induced by the drug,
seems hardly credible, but is nevertheless the case. The only ways in which such an
effect could be accounted for are, either by supposing that, in order to reach the
muscles of the limb in question the epileptic spasms generated in the cerebral cortex
have to pass through the cerebellum to reach the spinal centres by way of the inferior
cerebellar peduncle, which being divided prevents the impulses from passing ; or we
must admit that some afferent inhibiting influence has been taken off the half of the
cerebellum whose inferior peduncle has been divided, and that this allows this half of
the cerebellum to exert an influence on the opposite cerebral cortex sufficiently
inhibitory in character to prevent the centres from being discharged by the absinthe.
