288 INQUIRY AS TO THE EXISTENCE OF CURRENT FORCE DURING SECRETION.

nature of the forces concerned in the process of secretion ; as it might, however, be
considered premature to do $0, we shall defer our observations to a future opportu-
nity, and conclude by merely drawing attention to the resemblance first suggested,
we believe, by WoLLasroNn, between the polar decompositions which occur in the de-
composing cell of a voltaic circle and the process of secretion in living animals.

The facts which the experiments related in the present paper tend to establish are
as follows ;—

First. That, during biliary secretion, the bile and venous blood flowing from the
hepatic veins are in opposite electric states.

Secondly. During urinary secretion, the urine and venous blood flowing from the
renal vein are in opposite electric states.

Thirdly. During mammary secretion, the milk and the venous blood flowing from
the mammary veins are in opposte electric states. And,

Lastly. That when a circuit is formed between the mucous membrane of the lungs
