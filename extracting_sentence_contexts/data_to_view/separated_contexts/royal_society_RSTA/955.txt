These scientists
pointed out that tetrahedral complexes of d!° metals—in particular Cd(CN)4 units—share a
topology with the tetrahedral SiO, units that make up the silicate minerals [3,4]. This immediately
proved to be a fruitful analogy: inclusion compounds of Cd(CN), and other cyanometallates rival
the silicates themselves in structural variety. In fact, these compounds, with linear Cd—C = N—Cd
chains, mimic specifically the average structure of f-cristobalite, with a linear Si-O—Si linkage
(figure 2a,b). Later, the zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) were developed, again with
silicates in mind, but this time with more realistically bent links (figure 2c,d) [5]. Again, this
analogy proved immensely profitable, with the subsequent development of ZIF structures
analogous not only to the silicate zeolites but also to amorphous and even liquid silica [6,7].
