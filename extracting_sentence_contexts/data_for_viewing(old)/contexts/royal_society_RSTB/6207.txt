Fic. 6.—Loss of weight of a group of Glossina tachinoides, under two hours old at start of experiment, and
kept at 30° C (86-0° F) and 44% relative humidity. The five individuals are distinguished by
symbols. The small dots indicate mean values, through which the line is drawn.

the mean loss, during 24 hours’ starvation at a saturation deficiency of 17-8 mm
(relative humidity 44%). Similar work was done at three other humidities, Table
XII. In spite of the fact that flies under two hours old were used, there is consider-
able lack of uniformity in the mean weights at the commencement of the experiments.
The data given in Table XII under “ original weight’? show this. The mean
original weight of the group at 11%, relative humidity is significantly different from
all the other means ; the differences between the others are considerable but not
significant. We shall therefore proceed with the knowledge that the values obtained
at 11% relative humidity are open to suspicion. It is clear that the flies kept in
drier air have lost weight* more than those in moister ; this is well shown by the
last column, which gives the final weight as a percentage of the original weight
(the group at 11% humidity behaving irregularly). It appears that, as the number
of flies in each group is small, the ¢ test is appropriate for significance. If the
differences between the final weights (either in mg or as a percentage of original
weight) are tested, it is found that some differences between consecutive members
