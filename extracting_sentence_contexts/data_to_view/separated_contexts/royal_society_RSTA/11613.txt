Conclusionsâ€”We do not contest in any way, as our previous publications abund-
antly prove, the importance of the part which may be played in the mechanical
properties of the alloys by the residues which remain liquid after the main mass of
the alloy has solidified, the alloys being tested either at the ordinary temperature or
when heated. But, in order that it may be possible for such cements to intervene
and affect the mechanical properties of alloys, the cements must at least have a real
existence. Nothing indicates that they do exist in ten out of twelve of our alloys, but
we would not even express ourselves too positively on this point, for some new method
of etching may reveal new facts. The impurities which are sought for may happen to
concentrate themselves beyond the particular region which has been sectioned. These
are, however, for the present gratuitous suppositions.
