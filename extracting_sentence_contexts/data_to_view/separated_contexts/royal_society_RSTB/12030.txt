The time
taken for 20 beats was measured in triplicate and an average
calculated. Oxygen and ventilation measurements were made
at 30 min intervals until all of the O2 was exhausted within the
bottle or until there were no visible signs of movement from

The same technique used to measure the gill area was also used
to estimate surface areas of excised coxal plates of P. brevicornis
(n =5). Based on the fact that these plates were so thin, and
there is evidence of their being used in gas exchange in other
amphipods, they were considered putative EGS (electronic
