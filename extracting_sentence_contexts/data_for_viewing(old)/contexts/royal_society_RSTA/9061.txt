SonHustER ; they are therefore less likely to serve as a check on the. theory.

I have tried to represent the residuals of Table T by harmonics depending on the
time of some standard meridian, but with little success, and I am inclined to think
that they depend on local time so far as they are not merely irregularities peculiar to
particular observatories. The latter can hardly be the case with regard, at any rate,
to the 24-hour North force residuals; in other cases the position is much less clear.
These North force residuals seem to present a difficult problem, since they apparently
cannot be represented by any simple potential function. It may be recalled that the
amplitude of the semi-diurnal pressure variation seems to vary with latitude according
to the law sin* @, instead of sin* @ (or Q,*) as we have supposed ; the true law could
only be represented by the introduction of other harmonics besides Q,’ into our
theoretical calculations. Another fact worth noting is that the South component
of the semi-diurnal variation of wind velocity (at St. Helena) is markedly larger than
that calculated from Goxp’s theory* of the wind, barometric and temperature
variations, while the East component seems to be in agreement with theory. Such

meridianal atmospheric motions would produce electromotive forces along circles of
latitude, which, again, would give rise to North force variations. It is possible that
the germ of a satisfactory account of the above residuals is to be found in these
