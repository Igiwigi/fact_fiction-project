The same
reasoning would apply to the inheritance of an especially female characteristic through
the male line. The formula, of course, gives no explanation of why oy is small and
7,4 finite. It is only suggestéd that these outlying facts of heredity are not neces-

Sarily inconsistent with the formula. It may be argued that this account of skipping
3 generation would only apply to a characteristic which actually exists in both sexes,
teven if only in a small degree in one of them, and further, it assumes the distribution
‘of this small degree to be of a normal character. This argument would certainly
fouch characteristics functionally necessary and peculiar to one sex; it may be
Aoubted how far it would affect the question of secondary sexual characteristics,
‘Which may have rudimentary values in the sex of which they are not characteristic, It
must further be remembered, however, that our correlation formule are perfectly true
for cross heredity, and accordingly the idea of rudimentary value may be pushed a
‘ood way, even to the idea of latency in a second closely-allied organ.
