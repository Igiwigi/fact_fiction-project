solidify in this manner, then the solid in these alloys cannot be a pure body, but
must be a solid solution.

In unchilled and moderately slowly cooled ingots polishing, even without etching
or ignition, brings out a pattern of long slender combs well seen with a power of
10 diameters. This pattern is probably due to the more rapid oxidation of the first
formed Â«, which was very rich in copper. Heat-oxidation develops the same combs,
which do not fill more than three-quarters of the area. The lobes of a comb are not
isolated, but form a continuous skeleton. In every case a higher magnification makes
it evident that these combs are not sharply divided from the material round them,
but fade softly into it. In fact, the margin of a comb does not mark an abrupt
change in the process of crystallisation. This important point became very evident
in a section etched electrolytically by being made the anode in a cell containing
dilute sulphuric acid. This method of etching revealed the margins of the real
skeleton crystals. They have sharp edges, and occupy at least 99 per cent. of the
area, It is thus evident that the combs brought out by polishing or ignition, as seen
in fig. 1, are cores to the real skeletons of a, these latter being so closely packed that
it is only here and there that we can detect their boundaries. Thus, in spite of the
fact that the cores are somewhat richer in copper than the outside layers, we feel
justified in stating that the alloy solidified in one continuous process. Moreover, the
cavities between the real margins of the combs show that these combs, which so
nearly fill the field, are primary, that is to say, were formed during the process of
soliditication, the small cavities being caused by the presence of gas or by the
