Se the single quadric.

Z 70. The lineo-linear invariant ab'—a'b of two linear functions may be considered as
Siving the lineo-linear covariant ©,U.d,V—d,U.d,V of the two quantics U and V.

2nd in like manner the lineo-linear invariant - —200/+ca' may be considered as giving
Ihe lineo-linear covariant d2U. o3V —29,9,U.09,9,V +03U.95V of the quantics U, V.
And generally, any invariant whatever of a quantic or quantics of a given order or
Arders leads to a covariant of a quantic or quantics of any higher order or orders: Viz.
the coefficients of the original quantic or quantics are to be replaced by the derived
functions of the quantic or quantics of a higher order or orders.

71. The same thing may be seen by means of the theory of Fmanants. In fact, con-
sder any emanants whatever of a quantic or quantics; then, attending only to the
facients of emanation, the emanants will constitute a system of quantics the coefficients
of which are derived functions of the given quantic or quantics; the invariants of the
System of emanants will be functions of the derived functions of the given quantic or
quantics, and they will be covariants of such quantic or quantics; and we thus pass
from the invariants of a quantic or quantics to the covariants of a quantic or quantics

' of a higher order or orders.
