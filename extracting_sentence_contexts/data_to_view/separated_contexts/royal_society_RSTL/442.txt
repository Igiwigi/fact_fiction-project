It was first
placed among those substances which were considered as com-
posed of new earths; afterwards it was classed among those
which were found by analysis to be chiefly, and indeed almost
exclusively, composed of argill. This was already a great'step
towards the knowledge of its real nature; since it was thereby
placed, if not by the side of, at least at a very inconsiderable
distance from, the oriental gems, then known chiefly by the
name of sapphire. ; :

It is, in fact, among those--gems or stones, now known by

the names of sapphire, oriental ruby, &c, that corundum ought

to be placed; but the progress by which we have arrived at this
degree of knowledge was necessarily very slow, and was im-
peded by continual obstacles : for the scarcity and smallness of
the crystals of corundum, and the impression naturally made
upon our minds by the various appearances it exhibited to us,
were by no means likely to lead us to form a true judgment
respecting it. So that Mr .WERNER, whose great and acknow-
ledged talents have justly caused his opinion to be considered,
nearly throughout all Germany, as of the highest importance
in all mineralogical decisions, has hitherto continued to place
corundum between pitchstone and felspar; consequently, he
has removed it to a considerable distance from the sapphire,
since there exists, according to his classification, nearly thirty
intermediate substances. Crystallography also offers some difficulties with respect to
this stone ; and these difficulties are only to be guarded against
by a very particular study of it, and especially by an accurate
examination of all its varieties, as objects of comparison.
