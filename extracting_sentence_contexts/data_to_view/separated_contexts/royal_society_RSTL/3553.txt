In the Tulus terrestris, during the earlier
transformations, the addition is sextuple at each change, a ratio that agrees most curi-

ferred, from this fact, that this is the number of segments produced at each change
in all the Chilognatha, or that the new segments are produced in a corresponding
part of the body in the other divisions of this class, the Chilopoda. In these two
orders the parts in which the new segments appear differ greatly, and most distinctly
mark these two divisions of the Myriapoda. In the Chilognatha the segments are
always produced as above stated, but in the Chilopoda, the proper Scolopendradze,
according to Gervars*, the new parts are developed between each of the original
segments.
