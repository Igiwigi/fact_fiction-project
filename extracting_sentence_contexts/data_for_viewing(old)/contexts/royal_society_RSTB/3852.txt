Tawus. If the megasporophylls of Angiosperms, in which they phylogenetically close
up to constitute an ovary chamber for purposes of protection from desiccation, may
be wholly lost and replaced by new and improved syncarpous ovarian formations, and
be even reduced to mere free stigmatic tips (Composites, Geranium, ete.), and these in

turn be replaced by commissural stigmas (Cruciferee, Liliwm) and other secondary
stigmatic regions, it is sufficiently obvious that under xerophytic stress, in highly
specialised Gymnosperm phyla, the functionless megasporophyll would be rapidly
reduced and would soon entirely vanish, leaving its limiting single residual ovule
alone in its place. The fact that such loss of the megasporophyll had taken place
in the Paleozoic age (Cordaites), in the Mesozoic (Cycadeoidea), as well as in modern
Taxoids, shows that Welwitschia is not particularly exceptional in this respect.

Its special significance and value is that it presents a reduction of the gyncecium
to the absolute minimum in a floral structure that also contains an androecium, and
was once presumably hermaphrodite. In this it is unique. While the ovulate flower
of Taxus, for example, presents a decussate perianth of free scales (2+2+42), an aril
used for a dispersal function, an integument and a terminal nucellus, the ovulate
flower of Welwitschia shows two prophylls, a perianth of possibly two members
originally, used for a dispersal function, a pollen-collecting integument and a
terminal nucellus; a stage one degree more reduced than that of Taxus, but on
distinctly the same lines. Not that there need be the slightest affinity or relation-
