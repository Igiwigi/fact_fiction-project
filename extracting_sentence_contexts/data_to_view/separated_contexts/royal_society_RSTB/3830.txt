BAueH and others of Bewdley. Very few of these bear any record of the localities from which they were obtained,
though some are labelled as having been collected “near Bewdley,” from ‘“ Dowles
Quarry,” and from the “ railway cuttings near Dowles Bridge.” These specimens were
determined in 1886 by Dr. Kipsron, and recorded in his ‘Catalogue of the Paleozoic
Plants in the British Museum.’ The collection is, however, of little value for my
present purpose, owing to the absence of locality records, and in view of the fact that
two palobotanical horizons are represented in the Forest, as I hope to prove in the
present paper. I however add here a revised list of these specimens, with some
additional records. A List of the Specimens from the Wyre Forest Coalfield in the British Museum
Collection.
