© To obviate any ſuſpicion of the precipitation of filver being
owing to the phlogiſtication of the acid, I added to ſome of
the green liquor about an equal quantity of colourleſs nitrous:
Kcid and ſome diſtilled water,. and I kept this mixture boiling
Þalf 2n hour, in-order to diſengage and expel any phlogiſticated
fcid which it might contain. To the liquor, which remained
DerfeQly pellucid, Iadd-d a/ſolution of filver, upon which the
ecipitation immediately took place with all its uſual circum--
ances, and inas great a degree as before.
S If, upon examining the acids- which you or others may-
ereafter obtain by the inflammation of airs, a mixture of
Marine acid be conſtantly found to accompany the produftion
of the nitrous, the fact will be only analogous to all the other
known productions of nitrous acid; in all which, either in:
the natural formation of nitre as in Spain and India, or in the
Eiitre beds and walls made by art, a very large proportion of
marine ſalts is conſtantly obſerved ro accompany the nitre.

at the formation of this green powder by evaporation of this
