Nevertheless these provinces
include a region for which the mean temperatures during the three months exceed 92*,
which therefore must be considered as one of the very hottest regions of our globe;
besides, we must take further into consideration that clear days are not unfrequent,
during which the purity of the sky is not even limited, as it was in the period pre-

examined. The thermal equator enters the west of the Map at the latitude of 32®, and
only leaves the Indian peninsula near Ceylon in an easterly direction. The influence of height in the Pinjab is not very considerable in this season, and the

the decrease of temperature with height is more rapid than during any other part of
the year.
