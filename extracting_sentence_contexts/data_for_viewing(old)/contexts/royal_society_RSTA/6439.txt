also studies supporting the fact that ET has been primarily driven by climate trends, with
only a minor role played by a CO [104]. Moreover, climate warming may have an impact
on plant processes that are not included in ESMs, such as water loss from leaf cuticule
[105,106], which is independent of stomatal responses to a CO). Finally, land use and vegetation
changes severely affect land transpiration, and these are either highly uncertain in current
ESMs (e.g. the leaf area index [107]) or not included [108]. All of these processes mean
that evaluating future drought projections based on metrics using ESM simulations of ET
should be approached with caution [61], and this caution should also affect soil moisture and
runoff.

Some authors have suggested that including AED in drought severity metrics could
overestimate agricultural and ecological and hydrological drought projections, particularly in
water-limited regions [96], based on the fact that AED is higher than ET in these regions.



Nevertheless, as emphasized above, the role of AED in agricultural and ecological drought
severity is not only related to its influence on ET. Thus, in the assessment of agricultural
and ecological droughts, AED is not intended to be used as a substitute for ET to assess
drought severity. ET could be a substitute for precipitation in drought indices, as ET is the best
metric providing information on the real plant water use [109] and a much better metric than
precipitation or soil moisture, but AED must not be considered a substitute for ET since it is
a metric of demand, not of water use. It is important to select the drought metrics to assess
future drought severity, and the use of P-ET or soil moisture could underestimate agricultural
and ecological droughts caused by enhanced AED, particularly in water-limited regions. In these
