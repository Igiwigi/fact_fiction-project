As regards hearing, separate evidence is given in Experiment XV. of the localization
of this faculty in the superior temporo-sphenoidal convolution.
The absence of reaction to the usual auditory stimuli, combined with the effects of
stimulation of this convolution, afford evidence of the strongest possible character of the
Jocalization of this sense.
S The localization of smell is no less clearly indicated. Anatomically, the connexion
etween the olfactory tract and the subiculum cornu ammonis, though less evident in
Bos is clear in the monkey, and very apparent in the lower animals.
S The effects of irritation of this region are very constant and characteristic, and are of
Lhe same nature as direct irritation of the nostril or of the olfactory bulb itself.
2 Destruction of this region causes abolition or diminution of reaction to stimuli on the
ime ide as the lesion.
Z Taken together, these facts establish the localization of the sense of smell in the subi-
2ulum, or tip of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe.
& As to the sense of taste, the positive indications are less distinct than those of 8mell
'Sr hearing.
Z Yet the phenomena occasionally observed on stimulation of the lower part of the
Middle temporo-sphenoidal convolution, viz. movements of the lips and cheek-pouches,
Hay be taken in connexion with lesions affecting this region, and accompanied by loss
ET reaction to stimuli of taste, to afford evidence of no weak character for the localiza-
Ex of taste in or near this region.
Â£ That the centres of gastatory and olfactory perception are closely related to each other
Ynatomically i is rendered probable by the fact, often observed, of loss of taste and smell
Following severe blows on the head, and particularly of the vertex. It is not at all likely
That one and the same cause should simultaneously directly affect all the nerves which
