Though but a fragment, its
well-preserved internal organisation sufficed to show the general features of the
strobilus, which differed widely from those of any Carboniferous fructification
previously observed. I ventured to construct a restored diagram of this strobilus,t and also pointed out
a peculiar arched arrangement of the vessels of the xylem at each node, which I had
hitherto seen only in the true Calamites. This fact, combined with other structural
peculiarities equally Calamitean, led me to conclude that the strobilus was not only
the fruit of a highly developed form of Calamites, but that it was the only one
hitherto discovered which had any claim to that position.} Seventeen years elapsed before further traces of this fruit were discovered. But a
few weeks ago Mr. James Lomax, of Ratcliffe, one of that small band of auxiliaries to
whose diligence as collectors I have long been indebted for many of the materials upon
which my researches have been carried on, brought me some new sections made from
a nodule given to him by another of my assistants, Isaac EaRnsHAWw, of Oldham.
