The movements taking place in the face previously described were quite independent
of any of the association movements, were made quite voluntarily by the patient in
a natural manner. When she was asked to close her eye, that was done without any
movement of the muscles supplied by the spinal accessory, and on ordinary movement
of the latter no facial twitchings were observed.

I quote this case more fully than otherwise I should have done, had it not been that
the case, in so far as restoration of movements of the face independent of those of the
shoulder are concerned, has been by some writers apparently misunderstood. Thus
SHERREN (43) writes in 1906, “ Until recently no case had been recorded in which
dissociated voluntary movements were restored. In 1904, THoRBURN wrote of facio-
accessory anastomosis, ‘ this latter fact rendered these operations of comparatively
slight real benefit.’ Other writers who collected: cases from the literature came to
the same conclusion.” A reference to the paper (20), in which my case was published,
will show that independent voluntary dissociated movements were restored, as
far as the eyelids were concerned, commencing on the 49th day and gradually
improving up to the time of publication. The photographs published of the
patient also demonstrated that fact. This case was published in November, 1900,
and was the first case of spino-facial anastomosis in which restoration of voluntary
co-ordinated dissociated movements had taken place as the result of the operative
procedure.

Although the case of FAurE and Furer was the first published, and at the time
supposed to have been the first case in which such a procedure had been carried out,
