In this way, by the proper application of force, all the bendings and contortions
observed in glacier ice, and adduced in proof of its viscosity, can be accurately imitated.
Any observer, secing a straight bar of ice converted into a continuous semi-ring without,
being aware of the quality referred to, and having his attention fixed on the changes of
external form alone, would be naturally led to the conclusion that the sbstance is
viscous. But it is plainly not viscosity, properly s0 called, which enables it to change its
shape in this way, but a property which has hitherto been entirely overlooked by writers
upon glaciers.

= It has been established by observation, that a vertical layer of ice originally plane, and
= perpendicular to the axis of a glacier, becomes bent, because the motion of its ends is
E retarded in comparison with that of its centre. This is the fact upon which the viscous
= theory principally rests.
= In the experiments with the straight prism of ice, four successive moulds, gradually
DH augmenting in curvature, were made use of. In passing suddenly from the shape of one
Sto that of the other, the ice was fractured, but the pressure brought the separated
= surfaces again into contact and caused them to freeze together, thus restoring the con-
= tinuity of the mass. The fracture was in every case both audible and tangible; it could
Z be heard and it could be felt. A series of cracks occurred in succession as the different
S parts of the ice-prigm gave way, and towards the conclusion of the experiment, the
S crackling in some instances melted into an almost musical tone. But if instead of
S causing the change to take place by such wide steps as those indicated ; if instead of four
= moulds, forty, or four hundred were made use of; or better till, 8uppose a single mould
2 to have the power of gradually changing its curvature from a straight line to a semicircle
