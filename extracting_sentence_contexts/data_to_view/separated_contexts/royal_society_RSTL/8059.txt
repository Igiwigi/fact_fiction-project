Specimens of these old and matured fruiting stems
may exist among what we have hitherto termed Ulodendra. This explanation would give us the reason why we
noyer find cones or other appendages of a magnitude corresponding with the cicatricula of Ulodendron. The
chief argument against the idea that the cicatriculw of Ulodendron may be those of Zalonic enlarged by age
and growth, lies in the fact that the leaf-scars of Ulodendron do not appear to hayo undergone any corresponding
enlargement, â€”April 15, 1872,

invariably find that they proceed from the inner surface of the outer or ligneous cylinder,
and not from the larger vessels of the medullary one, and it is in the same radiating
cylinder that we find the medullary rays*. I have already stated my reasons for insisting
upon the recognition of the medullary character of these rays, and pointed out the
necessity for considering their primary origin in the nascent structure, prior to any
material differentiation occurring in its tissues, if we are to arrive at a philosophical
opinion respecting their nature. All these circumstances combined lead me to the con-
clusion that in the radiating vascular cylinder we have the representative of the woody
zone of exogenous plants.
