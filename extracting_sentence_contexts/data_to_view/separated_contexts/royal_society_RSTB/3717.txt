The number of
spermatogonial generations has been found constant for the species, and each division
is followed by a resting stage in which the chromosomes break up into fine granules
disposed on linin threads. We have seen that the volume of chromatin in the
secondary spermatocyte metaphase is half that of the earlier mitoses, and have

noted that no resting stage precedes this division ; we have found that the volume is
the same in both spermatogonial and primary spermatocyte metaphases, and that the
increase in the latter occurs during the growth period. Coincidence cannot be
responsible for the fact that the normal amount of chromatin is found to be halved
in the only mitosis that is not preceded by a resting stage; and we must accordingly
realise that the total volume remains constant as a result of growth occurring
during the intervals of division. The dissociation of chromosomes witnessed in these
stages obviously facilitates this growth, and the phenomena of the resting stages are
therefore explained. Drawings representing members of the eight spermatogonial length-groups are
given in figs.
