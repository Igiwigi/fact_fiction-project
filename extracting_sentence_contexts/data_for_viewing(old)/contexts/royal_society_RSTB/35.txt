and traced out step by step. The resumption of the arrested development, under the
conditions of moisture and of temperature which we call favourable to germination,
involves intricate metabolic processes in which the different materials that have been
stored are all separately concerned, each group of bodies being transformed into nearly
related ones which are adapted for the new conditions of life. Instead of the resting
forms of proteids, carbohydrates, &c., which are not diffusible and hence cannot pass
from cell to cell and go traverse the plant, we have new forms which can readily
travel to those points where growth is proceeding and new cells are being formed, and
hence plastic material is required. The details of these transformations are in many
cases still obscure, though some facts have been ascertained which throw light upon
the nature of some of the chemical processes. In the case of the starch, which is so
constant a constituent in seeds, it has been proved that the formation of sugar takes
place from it by the agency of a ferment, exactly as it does in the corresponding pro-
cess in the animal economy. From almost any seed a so-called diastatic ferment can
be obtained, and so constant is the occurrence of the latter body in vegetable organisms
that it can be prepared from almost any part of plants. From analogy it would seem
probable that the proteolytic changes noticeable would have a similar cause, and that
from seeds in which large quantities of reserve proteids are stored evidence of such a
body could be obtained.

Other seeds are noticeable in connection with the large store of cellulose which they
contain in their endosperm cell-walls, a store which disappears as the process of
