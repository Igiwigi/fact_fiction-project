Above this velocity, for example for a velocity
of 200ms~1, the response of the anomalous glasses, Pyrex and fused silica, was quite different
from the response of the soda-lime glass (a normal glass). Whereas in Pyrex Hertzian cone cracks
formed (figure 3), there were no cone cracks formed in the soda-lime glass and instead splinter-
type cracks formed (figure 4). In fact, in fused silica Hertzian cone cracks formed even at the
maximum projectile velocity of approximately 330 ms*!. In the case of the Pyrex, Hertzian cone
cracks formed at the maximum impact velocity of 250ms~! used [16]. Another anomalous glass,
namely GeO, has also shown a similar response [19].
