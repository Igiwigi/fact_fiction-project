Diurnal Inequality and Solar-diurnal Variation. Tables IV. and V. p. 284. The diurnal inequality (which is by no means identical with the slar-diurnal variation
as has been sometimes assumed) has in fact two principal constituents, viz. the solar-
diurnal variation itself, and the disturbance-diurnal variation. It is obtained for each
month by taking the differences between the mean positions of the magnet at each of
the twenty-four hours and the mean position in the month (the latter being the mean of
all the days and all the hours in the month).
