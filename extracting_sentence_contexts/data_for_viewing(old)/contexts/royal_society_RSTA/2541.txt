Figure 6. Demonstration of the fact that a two-dimensional network of connected squares has exactly one RUM. We start with
the ring of four squares labelled 1. In two dimensions, each square has 3 d.f,, and there are two constraint equations per linkage.
This means that for the ring labelled 1, F — C = 4. These four overall degrees of freedom are the two whole-body translations,
one whole-body rotation, and the internal shear mode. When we add the two squares labelled 2 to extend the row, we add 6
more d.f. and six constraints, retaining the balance F — C = 4. Clearly, further extension of the row will continue to retain the
balance. When we start to add another row with the pair labelled 3, we have the same argument as when we extended the
row with the squares labelled 2. Thus we continue to retain the result F — C = 4. When we add the next square for the new
row, one labelled 4, we need to be alittle careful. Clearly, we add 3 d.f. to the total, but we actually add three constraints rather
than the 4 we might expect from the fact that we create two new linkages. The point is that one linkage adds two constraints,
but the other linkage is formed by the correct orientation of this new square (as anticipated in the analysis of the rods shown in
figure 2), which means adding just one new constraint. Thus the number of additional degrees of freedom and constraints are
the same, and thus we will retain F — C = 4 for whatever size we now make the structure. (Online version in colour.)

of RUM wave vectors. We start with the arrangement labelled 1. With six triangles and six linkages, we have 18 d.f. and 12
