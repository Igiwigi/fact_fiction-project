usually have algebraic decay. For this reason as well as those mentioned above, £ with domain
D1({0, 1]) is considered in the present work. Similar issues ina slightly different but related setting
(a continuum KdV system near a point of soliton stability change) have been brought up in [44].

We now consider the properties of the linear operator £. Observe that £ is a densely defined
unbounded operator on the Hilbert space D°({0,1]) with its domain being D'({0,1]). Thus, the
adjoint of £ can be defined, and indeed we find that

L=-J'L], (3.6)

so that £J and JL are self-adjoint (note that J-! =-J). Observe also that the spectrum of L is
2ni-periodic, because e** Ztw(t) =e +2)" (Ze (z) e2"*7) and Ztw(t) e~2""* is also a travelling
wave with velocity 1. This symmetry is due to the fact that the shift operators $, commute with
the multiplier eT for ne Z. Owing to the time-translation invariance of the solution Xtw, an
important property of L is that its kernel contains

C0 = 07 Xtw, (3.7)

as can be directly verified by differentiating (3.1) in t and evaluating the result at X = Xtw.
Here we assume the generic situation when ker(L) =span{eo}. Similarly, we have ker(L*) =
span{J~teo}. Next, we observe that (eo,J~teo) =0, where (-,-) denotes the inner product in
D°({0, 1]). This implies that e9 € (ker(£*))+ = im (L), and thus there exists e; € D'({0,1]) such that
eo = Lei, so that the algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue 4 =0 for L is at least two. In fact,
differentiating (3.2) in c, we obtain cL(d-Xtw) = 7 Xtw, SO
