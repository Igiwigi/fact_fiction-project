Thus, we are pleased
that the Institute and the Faculty of Actuaries have joined us in this Meeting. Indeed, this particular
meeting arose as a continuation of the City-Science and Technology Dialogue, initiated by my
predecessor as President, Sir Michael Atiyah, who has also kindly agreed to chair this session. The
organizers of the programme have, however, wisely in my view, broadened its scope, so we shall in fact
be engaging with other aspects of ELSI. I am sure the Symposium will arouse the interest of the public
as well as that of our legislators. After an initial refusal, the Government finally agreed to the proposal
of the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee to set up a Genetics Commission.
