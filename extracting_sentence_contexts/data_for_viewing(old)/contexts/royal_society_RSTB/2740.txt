* From Hxapr’s notes (1900) on the subject it would seem possible that goats and pigs could be made
to illustrate a similar gradation from the moncestrous habit in the natural state to varying degrees of
polyeestrum, under domestication or in captivity, but the facts about these animals are less perfectly
known,

The Scotch Black-faced sheep, further afford evidence that where the number of
recurrent cestrous periods is increased (beyond the normal number in the home of the
breed in question, e.g., the Highlands, in the case of the Black-faced sheep) the
duration of the cestrus is shorter,* while, whether partly or entirely as a consequence
of this latter fact, the length of the dicestrous cycle is also less.+

Superficial Phenomena of the Proestrum and Cistrus.

The external signs of the procestrum in sheep are comparatively slight. The
vulva is usually somewhat congested, being slightly swollen, or reddened. There
is, too, a slight flow of mucus from the vaginal opening, but only in one instance
have I observed any flow of blood. Bleeding of the uterine wall, I find to be
extremely slight; but it is in the majority of cases, as I shall subsequently show,
present to some degree. External bleeding during procestrum takes place with many
of the domestic animals, and its occasional occurrence ‘in the sheep has been noted
by Wixtsaire (1883) and other authors. The flow of mucus from the vaginal
opening, although primarily a characteristic of procestrum, may continue during
