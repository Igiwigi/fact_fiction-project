moisture there remaining. It is obvious that the deeper-rooting species had drawn up
much of their needed water from the subsoil ; partly, perhaps, directly, and partly by
virtue of increased capillary action induced by the pumping out of the upper layers.
It was also found that, probably in part due to the action of the roots, and in part to
chemical reactions, the subsoil of the nitrate plot was more disintegrated and amelio-
rated than that of either plot 9 or the unmanured plot 3.

With these few general remarks, indicating some of the characteristic differences of
result, on the two plots, we now turn to a detailed consideration of their comparative
botany.

The following Table (LXXV., pp. 1364-5) gives, in the usual form, a record of the
facts relating to the plot under consideration ; it also shows the amounts yielded by
the different orders and species compared with those on the unmanured plot 3, and on
plot 9 with the mineral manure and the nitrogen supplied as ammonia-salts.

In the firs place there were, on the average, two fewer Graminee, two fewer
Leguminosm, and 16 fewer Miscellanezs, than without manure, the average number
found in the four separations in the samples from plot 14 being 29. Compared with
plob 9 there was but little difference in number ; in fact, only one more species.

There is not, very much difference in the average percentages of total Graminew,
