mucous membrane.

There is another point that deserves mention. We have een that the anterior
oxyutic glands contain, as a rule, somewhat larger granules than the posterior, and,

further, that in some of the former, granules like those of the csophageal glands not
infrequently occur. If, then, the granules are connected with the formation of
ferment, we should expect a definite weight of the anterior gastric region to contain
more ferment than an equal weight of the median gastric region. This, in fact, is
the case (see experiment given below) ; part of the difference in amount is, however,
probably due to the difference in the size of the glands in the two regions.

Lastly, we can consider the pyloric glands. The acid extract of the dried mucous
membrane does contain some pepsin, for it dissolves carmine-fibrin more quickly than
hydrochloric acid alone ; but the amount is very small, and we know that a small
amount of pepsin is found in nearly every tissue. T have not compared the ferment-
content of the pyloric region of the stomach with that of other tiszues, since it 8eemed
© to me that even if any pepsin is produced by the pyloric glands the amount must be
E 80 8mall as to be unimportant in digestion. There seemed to me to be no reason for
S ascribing any special function of producing pepsin to the pyloric glands in the Frog,
© and consequently no reason for ascribing any such function to the cells of the necks of
