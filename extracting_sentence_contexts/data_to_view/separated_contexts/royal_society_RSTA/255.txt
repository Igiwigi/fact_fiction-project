We have thus proved (i) of Lemma 1. Also

X(Y, HY) =O (4-4)
when —y”<v<o; in fact, when —o'<v<o.

Differentiating (2-3) logarithmically with respect to ~, we obtain

do cos @ 2mcosy _ ~u)
is Galante é ;

By (4-2) and (4-3), 0<y-+o<mn. Hence dw/du>0, so long as

(4:5)

#+0<2nd-' cosy,

If A(1/x) >4, i.e. if 21d-!cosy>7, we see that increases with « throughout the
whole interval y << 4m. This is (ii) of Lemma 1. If A(1/k) <4, i.e. if 278~!
