"These formulee simply express the fact, that the absolute velocity is equivalent to the
relative velocity together with det (Q, R).

38. Let us next apply the formulz to the acceleration of a particle. Let, as before,
v., 2,, ». be the components of the particle's velocity V, and let f., f,, f. be the components
of the particle's acceleration. Then, since the acceleration is the complete differential
coefficient of the velocity, of which v,, v,, v. are the components, it follows at once from
section 36, that
