the complete process of identification and tracking of droplets can take place at much higher
rates (few hundred fps) without trading-off the accuracy, and taking advantage of the existing ML
frameworks highly optimized for the GPUs.

The application developed by training a cutting-edge deep learning model can be efficiently
used to compute the trajectories of droplets in dense emulsion systems simulated by the lattice
Boltzmann method or any other computational method capable of capturing the relevant physics.
It is worth noting that in both cases explored, and especially in the case of the Tapered channel,


the data used to train the network depart noticeably from those acquired via simulations.
The fact that the network is nevertheless able to identify the droplets and efficiently track
them over sequential frames bodes well for its generalization to more complex applications,
particularly for tracking deformable biological bodies in complex fluid flows. This will make the
subject of future work.

4. Conclusion

In this work, we demonstrated an automated procedure to adapt a cutting edge deep learning-
based application, called YOLO and DeepSORT, to infer trajectories of droplets in dense
emulsions in microchannels. We have shown that the deep network can effectively be trained with
synthetic data, thereby bypassing the labour-intensive process of acquiring the training data. The
present tool performs competitively with state-of-the-art object tracking and detection algorithms
in terms of inference speed.
