While the biconjoint animal has lost the use of its utricles, its more conspicuous
symptoms—e.g., axial ventriflexion, downward diving and “looping the loop” in
water, retention of body-righting ability, development of specific torque on being
rotated, supine or prone, about a vertical axis, rapid beat of its hind-limbs (irrelate
reaction) in response to quick backward tipping of the head—may be said rather to

exhibit the unrestrained influence of its posterior canals. The facts that its compen-
satory reactions to slow tilt are absent, that during stationary posture it may lean
markedly to one or other side and that, when dropped from a height, it fails to land
properly, are more direct indications of the loss of its gravity receptors.

Through the frog’s serviceableness for the study of posterior canal function the
following knowledge is gained. The posterior canals, whether inverted or in their
normal orientation, can be stimulated by adequate angular acceleration about a
vertical axis, the right canal being stimulated when the animal is rotated towards
its right, and vice versa. The reflex result in each instance is assumption of spinal
torque, leading in the supine animal to body-righting. Just as excitation of the
isolated utricular maculae by sudden forward tilt, so bilateral excitation of the
isolated posterior canals by sudden backward tilt causes an irrelate reaction.
