saturated with oxygen and is almost black in colour, while the colour
of the subject was absolutely normal. ‘There was also no sign, direct or indirect, of
want of oxygen in any part of the body, and the oxygen pressure in the venous blood
can hardly have been below 20 mm., or the arterial oxygen pressure below 60 mm. It thus appears that, apart altogether from the evidence furnished by our deter-
minations of the actual arterial oxygen pressure, the diffusion theory entirely fails to
explain the facts observed on Pike’s Peak, and comes nowhere near explaining them,
unless, indeed, some adaptive change occurs by which the rate of diffusion is
enormously increased. Increase in the circulation rate, if it existed, would not help,
for such an increase would raise the oxygen pressure in the venous blood, and so
diminish the available diffusion pressure. ‘The same remark applies to increase in the
hzemoglobin percentage.
