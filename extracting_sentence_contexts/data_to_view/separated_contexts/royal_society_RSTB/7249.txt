Leaves from Hawks Tor. a to ¢, site 42A, 100 to 98 cm.; d, ¢, site 36, wood layer
of lower peat (not the peat monolith series). a, c, d (magn. x 6); 6, e (magn. x 3). Leaves (figures 7 and 15) of at least two species were collected from a woody layer at
site 36 (not that of the peat monolith) and also from the extreme base of site 42A (100 to
98 cm.). These also probably belong to a small-leaved species of willow, but the fragments
were not adequate for a certain identification, in view of the fact that the species that come
within the size range, such as S$. repens and S. myrsinites, are extremely variable in leaf
form. Saxifraga cf. granulata L. Three seeds of a saxifrage from the lower layers of the lake mud at site 42B, 300 to 298,
298 to 296, 292 to 290, 280 to 270 cm., may be referred tentatively to S$. granulata.
