In the case of the more stereo-

' 2. et typed body saccades, flies always bank about the same two J
axes in body-centred coordinates (figure 2e). These axes are 5
not perfectly aligned, however; flies bank about an axis that w
is approximately 35° off the longitudinal body axis, whereas = =~
they counter-bank about an axis that is more nearly aligned ©
with the roll axis. The reason for this discrepancy can be 3

explained by the fact that while the animal banks it also ©
begins to yaw. Yawing at a banked angle results in a nose-
down motion (in the world reference frame), and as a conse-
quence the fly can regain an upright pose by producing a
pure roll, without generating any nose-down pitch. Flies
regulate the turn angle of the saccade by adjusting the
amount of torque they generate and not by changing the
orientation of rotation relative to the body frame.
