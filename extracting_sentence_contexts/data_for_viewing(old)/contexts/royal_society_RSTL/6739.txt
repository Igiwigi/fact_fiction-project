bodies in obedience to laboratory processes and at the same time apt to rid itself of
connexions once formed in the most violent manner—as the explosive character of many
Nitrogen compounds forcibly illustrates. We should further be able, much more satis-
factorily than we are at present, to account—by processes established to be going 0
under our own observation—for the actually large total amount of combined Nitrogen
which we know to exist and to circulate, in land and water, in animal and vegetable
life, and in the atmosphere.

But another and potent reason for investigating the relation of plants to the free or
uncombined Nitrogen of the atmosphere is to be found in the fact, that the question
has, of late years, been submitted to an immense amount of research by numerons
experimenters, 'and from the results obtained very opposite conclusions have been
arrived at. Thus, M. Bovss!NGauLT concludes that plants do not assimilate the free
-or uncombined Nitrogen of the atmosphere. M. G. ViLLe maintains, on the contrary,
that the assimilation of free Nitrogen does take place, and further, that, under favour-
-able circumstances, a considerable proportion of the Nitrogen of a plant may be derived
From this source. Others have experimented in connexion with the subject on a more
Aimited scale; and various explanations have been offered of the discrepant results and

clusions of M. BoussINGAULT and M. G. VILLE.

Before entering upon the discussion of our own experimental evidence in regard to
