 voking a response from the other terminal. And this method shows us that in the
ordinary case of the air-spark discharge it passes right through the tube before this
Â© response comes, if in fact ib can be said to come at all. One of the most important
consequences that necessarily follows from this is that the discharges at the two
terminals of the tube are entirely independent, and are primarily determined each by
the conditions at its own terminal and only in a secondary degree, if at all, by the
conditions that exist at the opposite terminal. We shall hereafter recur to this point,
and shall show still more conclusively the complete independence of the discharge at
either terminal of a tube, but ib will be well to call attention here to the very
Qmportant consequences that flow from this principle.
