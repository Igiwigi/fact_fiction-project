486 PROF, W. J. SOLLAS ON THE STRUCTURE OF

that bone and the pterygoid, a relation which I had attributed to dislocation. It
obtains, however, in all my specimens and in Dr. Wason’s as well and thus seems
too constant to be the result of accident. Further, on a, re-examination of sections
we found the pterygoid and the false “‘ quadrate” so precisely adapted to the sides of
the head of the “ articulare ” (fig. 20) that such an explanation became impossible and
it was necessary to admit that all three bones still retain their original position.

We are thus led to conclude that Dr. Warson’s view is correct. The bone which
had every appearance of being the ar ticulare is in fact two bones, the articulare and
the quadrate, which in one of our specimens retain their natural position and
articulate with each other.

Fic. 3.—Original interpretation of the suspensorial region. The “articulare” is displaced towards the
right: in its natural position it would be partly concealed by the “ quadrate.” (x 5.)

This renders necessary a renewed identification of the bones previously named
