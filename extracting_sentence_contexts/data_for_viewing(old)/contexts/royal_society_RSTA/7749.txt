magnitude. Hence the deflexion A of the magnetometer will be a simple harmonic function —
of x and its mean value will be zero, whatever the distribution of magnetization.


RELATING TO MAGNETISM AND THE EARTH’S ROTATION 355

_ When, however, the magnetometer magnet is not located on the axis of rotation of the
cimen but at some distance off, the field will vary in a complicated manner as the
cimen is rotated, since the various elements of the irregular distribution will be brought
turn nearer or farther away from the magnetometer. Thus the curves are not simple
onic and the mean deflexion is not in general zero.

The fact that the mean deflexion is zero when the vertical axis of rotation of the specimen
js coincident with the axis of the magnetometer, whatever the nature of the irregular
distribution of the permanent magnetization, is of crucial importance for the static-body
experiment described in § 6, for it allows the effect of any irregular magnetization to be
iminated.

5:9. Susceptibility of metal cylinders

The susceptibility of a number of cylinders was measured by the method described in
4 4-8, that is, by applying a given horizontal field of the order of +0-03 G to the cylinder
‘gnd measuring the induced horizontal dipole. In table 7 are given the measured suscepti-

dogether with the text-book values measured, of course, in much larger fields. All the
