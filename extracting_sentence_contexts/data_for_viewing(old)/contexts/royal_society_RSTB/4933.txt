to fall at a rapidly diminishing rate as the death temperature was approached. No
effect whatever of this kind is apparent. If we omit Tray 4, because the hatching is
there so perfect that the turning has not scope to show its full effect, the ratios of the
“ five-times ” to the “ twice ” hatchings for Trays 5, 3, and 2 are 2°0, 1-7, and 0-5 respec-
tively—a result which would require the hatching in Tray 2 of several eggs (say four or

five) in place of the one egg actually hatched to be consistent with the redistribution
of temperature theory.

Test VI. (Table X.).—The remaining test depended on the fact that if change of
temperature distribution in the egg is to account for the effect of extra turning, this
effect should vanish if the extra turning occurs in a region where the temperature is
uniform.
