@heasured. The larvae obtained from the kept ova were of practically the same size as
Fhose obtained with an increased amount of sperm.
= In structure the hybrids were, as a rule, distinctly inclined to the maternal or
Btrongylocentrotus type. In Exp. 13 they were of an intermediate type, and practi-
tally undistinguishable from the hybrid larve obtained in the corresponding experiment
Bvith Echinus ? and Strongylocentrotus 3. In the next two experiments the larvee
Swere of a distinctly Strongylocentrotus type, but still showed some traces of their

ixed parentage. Also they were rather irregular in size and form, a few of the larvee

aving a short second skeleton in the anal arm, and others of them being of a dwarfed
form, _ In Exps. 126 and 141 the larve were of the Strongylocentrotus type, but had
prickles projecting from the body skeleton. They were, in fact, of the same type as
the reciprocally crossed hybrids in Exp. 129. In Exp. 142 the larve were again
irregular in size and form, double anal arm skeletons being fairly common. In the
next two experiments the larve were chiefly of the Strongylocentrotus type, but some
of them approached the intermediate form. In the last experiment they seemed to be
of an almost pure Strongylocentrotus type. On the whole, therefore, these hybrids
appeared to be more inclined to the Strengylocentrotus type than were the reciprocally
crossed hybrids to the Echinus type. As in the case of the Spherechinus-Strongylo-
