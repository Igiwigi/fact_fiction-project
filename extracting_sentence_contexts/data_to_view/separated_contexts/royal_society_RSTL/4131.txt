Let N be the number found
in the table of differences corresponding to any interval, as for example from F to G;
then the numerical value of N, that is to say, N or —N, according as N is positive


BANDS SEEN IN THE SPECTRUM, 231

or negative, gives the number of bands seen between F and G. For anything that
appears from the imperfect theory of the bands given in the preceding article, it
would seem that the 8ign of N was of no consequence. It will presently be seen,
however, that the sign is of great importance : it will be found in fact that the sign
+ indicates that the second arrangement mentioned in art. 2 must be employed ;
-that is to say, the plate must be made to intercept light from the thin end of the
prism, while the sign — indicates that the first arrangement is required. It is hardly
necessary to remark that, if N should be fractional, we must, instead of the number
of bands, speak of the number of band-interyals and the fraction of an interval. Although the number of bands depends on nothing but the values of N, the values
of M are not without physical interest.
