heat of 100* C. Now if 10 millims. of a liquid are athermanous to a heat-difference of,
say, 80%, may not 3 millims. well be athermanous to a heat-difference of 10*?
$ 39. Diffusion—It is well known that when two unequally heated portions of the
ame liquid, or of two miscible ones are mixed, a state of thermal equilibrium between
the two is established, and a temperature results intermediate between those of the
mixed liquids, and dependent upon their temperatures, Mas8es, and capacities for heat.
If snch experiments stood alone, it would be difficult, either by the dynamic or the con-
ditional theory of heat, to disprove the assertion that no interchange of heat takes place
between particle and particle, —that each particle maintains its original temperature,
and that, being mutually diluted, the effect (for instance on the mercury of a thermo-
meter) is the resultant of two unequal but continual efforts.

$ 40. But the fact that substances in contact establish thermal equilibrium without
mutual interpenetration, shows that the first method of heat equalization may and does
take place. The question, however, still remains :—Ts the equalization of temperature
instantaneous when two liquids of unequal temperature are perfectly mixed? When a
vessel of cold water is placed over a flame, may not the water at the bottom which has
the temperature of the bottom, diffuse into the colder water without immediately losing
its temperature*? All analogy, indeed, indicates the high improbability of snch an
occurrence, but by no means its impossbility. The question is of importance in our
present direction of research ; for it may be maintained that the heat which appears at
the lower cone has been conveyed downwards by the downward diffusion of the warmer
liquid at the top, instigated by the difference in density of the upper and lower portions.

$ 41. To et this question at rest, the bottom of the upper cone was painted with a
