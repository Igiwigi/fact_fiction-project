at the bottom of the sea, and the pressure disturbance therefore becomes negligible
except when the waves advance over shallow water. This would then suggest that
there is no stress disturbance at the bottom of the deep sea, and the microseisms can be
developed only when the gravity waves advance over shallow water. But we have
already pointed out that microseisms begin to make their appearance long before the
arrival of the monsoon current on the Malabar coast with rough seas. Storms also
invariably give rise to pronounced microseisms when they are in the mid-Arabian Sea
or in the centre of the Bay of Bengal.

When due account is taken of the fact that equation (10) ‘is applicable only to the
superficial layer, the pressure disturbance at the bed of the sea can be obtained in two
stages. Assume that the motion due to the surface disturbance has become negligible
at the depth y = — h, where h is only a small fraction of d. Then if P, is the pressure
disturbance at this depth, equation (11) gives

Pi = ge (h +1).

The pressure P, due to the column of fluid between this level (y = — h) and the bed of
the sea (y = — d) is simply gp (d — h). The total pressure at the bed of the sea is
therefore ge (d +4). In other words, the stress over each element of area of the bed
is equal to the weight of the superincumbent fluid at any instant. That the variation
of this total load over each element of area of the bed comes into play in producing
