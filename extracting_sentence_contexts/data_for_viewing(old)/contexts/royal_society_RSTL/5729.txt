* The formulz here exhibited are Evier's, or rather EuLzr's as simplified by Mr, CocxLs. They indi-
cate the connexion between the coefficients of the quintic and the constituents of its roots. Those consti-
tuents, by LacnaxGz's process, are expressed as rational functions of the roots, It is to be obseryed that
Evizr's functions arc cyclical. In fact, applying 2' to the cycle
