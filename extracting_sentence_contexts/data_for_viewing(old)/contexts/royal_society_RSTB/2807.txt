endothecium ; or carrying the analysis in the latter case to its extreme limit, the first
segments in the upper half of the zygote, or even the ovum itself, would be the
archesporium,

The fact is that this sort of analysis of formative tissues has served its turn ; it
has led to much detailed investigation, and elicited facts, as regards segmentation,
a knowledge of which is of value for comparison, But it has also shown that the
segmentations which lead up to the formation of spore-mother-cells are not comparable
in all cases. The time has come, in presence of so many divergent details, to frankly
admit that there is no general law of segmentation underlying the existence of that
cell, ov cells, which “ a last analysis” may mark out as the “ archesporium,” and that,
therefore, the general application of such a term to those cells which the analysis
discloses, has no scientifie meaning, beyond the statement of the histiogenie fact.* At
the same time the value of the details that have been acquired by the pursuit of the
archesporium, must not be underestimated for purposes of comparison, What is
dangerous is the attachment to them of ulterior ideas ; the assumption that because
a definite “ archesporium” is often found, it should by rights be always present, and
the effort to trace in its appearance homologies which seem based on forced rather
than on natural comparisons. The term has become so established in the literature
of the subject that it cannot be summarily discarded ; it may be retained merely in
a descriptive sense in those cases where the cell (or cells) which gives rise to a
sporogenous group is obvious, but in a descriptive sense only.

The discrepancies which thus become apparent in the course of development
between different types of sporangia tend to justify the position already adopted on
