portion of muriate of lime, which is not found in the salt pre-
pared by evaporating sea water in metallic yessels, nor even
in the mother liquor, or uncrystallizable residue, In sea salt
prepared by rapid evaporation, the insoluble portion is a mix-
ture of carbonate of lime with carbonate of magnesia, and a
fine silicious sand ; and in the salt prepared from Cheshire
brine, it is almost entirely carbonate of lime, The insoluble
part of the less pure pieces of rock salt is chiefly a marly
earth, with some sulphate of lime. The quantity of this im-
purity, as it is stated in the table, is considerably below the
average, which in my experiments has varied from 10 to 45
parts in 1000. Some estimate of its general proportion, when
ascertained on a larger scale, may be formed from the fact, that
government, in levying the duties, allows 6, 1b. to the bushel,
of rock salt, instead of z361b. the usual weight of a bushel of
salt,
