facial junction. The stylo-mastoid foramen showed the central facial forming a
bulbous termination projecting about 3's; inch, and terminating in some cicatricial
tissue. The right side of the tongue showed wasting to a considerable extent.

4, COMPARISON OF ResuLTs or THE VARIOUS EXPERIMENTS.

The series of experiments is divided into two sets, in one of which the anastomosis
was performed immediately after section of the facial, and in the other of which an
interval of time was allowed to elapse between section of the facial and suture of its
peripheral end to the substitute nerve. Of the former group there were six experi-
ments and of the latter four. In all the primary anastomoses the wound healed by
first intention, but in the secondary anastomoses failure of primary union occurred
in three. These failures of primary union were probably due to the fact that the
animals, after so much confinement as occurs before the second operation takes place,
are not in so healthy a condition as when first brought to the laboratory. In this
respect I have found monkeys more satisfactory than dogs, as I have never seen in a
monkey failure of primary union.
