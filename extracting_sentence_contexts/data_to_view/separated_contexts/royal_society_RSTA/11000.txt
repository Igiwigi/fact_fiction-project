The pseudo-boundaries are found to consist in small variations of level in the surfaces
of the grains in which they occur. Fig. 44 is a high-power photograph of a set of
real and pseudo-boundaries showing slip-bands. It will be noticed that on the two sides of a real boundary the slip-bands are
independent of one another, whereas the slip-bands cross a pseudo-boundary with
only a slight change of inclination, which is to be ascribed to the fact that the
surface under examination is not a true plane. There is a slight slope on each side
of the pseudo-boundary, and the lines are consequently more or less inclined to one
another. Again, as we have noticed in other examples, the slope is not as a rule
constant and hence the lines are slightly curved.
