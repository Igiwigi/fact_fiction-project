But in addition to the clusters
of the primary colours it was observed that there were clusters of the secondary colours,
yellow, blue-green and purple, which were produced by groups of red and green grains,
green and violet grains, and violet and red grains, respectively. When viewed at a distance
the whole surface of the mixture of grains appeared to be mottled just as a Lumiére screen
does. One curious fact was noticed, however, namely that the scale of the clusters was
different in the two cases. In the Lumiére screen the clusters of any given colour, for
example red, were 0-5 mm. apart, and the starch grains on the average 0-01 mm. diameter,
so that the distance from the centre of one red cluster to the centre of the next was equal to
about 50 grain diameters.
