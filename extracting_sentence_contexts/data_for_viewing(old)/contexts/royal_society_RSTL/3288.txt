composition, made it at once evident that they must haye been drifted into their pre-
sent position by currents of water. Again, near Fort Augustus, the Great Glen, with
the exception of the central part, where the river has worn for itself a broad course,
is filled with irregular strata about thirty feet in thickness of sand, gravel, and coarse
shingle. In the sand 8ome of the layers are most regularly wayed, as if by a tide
ripple. These beds are about seventy feet above the sea; fringes of similar deposits
skirt at intervals both sides of the Great Glen, but where they are present they do not
oceur, as far as I was enabled to observe, at a greater height than about 100 feet,
that is, than the water-shed of this great valley, â€”a fact somewhat analogous to the
coincidence in leyel between the true shelves or roads and the heads of the valleys in
which they occur. At the south-west end of the Great Glen, nearly opposite to Loch
Leven, there are some extensive flats, which from a distance appear to be similarly
compoxsed, and which in one part have been modeled into two nearly regular terraces,
one rising above the other. A somewhat similar structure may be observed in a part
between Loch Eil and Loch Lochy ; and this structure can only be explained by water
having successively occupied for long periods different levels.

Referring now to more distant points, we find in the broad valley below Loch Tulla
(a tributary of Loch Awe, and the stream flowing thence enters Loch Etive,) there
are some appearances, although obscure, of the bottom of the valley having been
once filled up with stratified alluyium. On the river Tay, however, near Loch Do-
