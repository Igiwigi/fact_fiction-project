(67) is of the type susceptible to the method of Wiener & Hopf (Titchmarsh 1937). The
Wiener-Hopf procedure would be facilitated by the fact that the kernel (4 |x—&€|) is
defined as a Fourier integral in (66), but this really emphasizes the irrelevance of bringing
) into the analysis and indicates that the dual integral equations offer a more direct line
of attack.

Another slightly different formulation of the problem may be devised. So far we have
considered the complete field in terms of a ‘correction’ to the field existing in the absence
of the perfectly conducting sheet. Now let us consider it in terms of a ‘correction’ to the
field which would exist were the conducting sheet infinite instead of semi-infinite. This
alternative approach (associated when x= 1 with the exact electromagnetic form of
Babinet’s principle) indeed yields slightly simpler integral equations than those given above,
owing to the fact that we are dealing with a vertically polarized field; on the other hand,
the new ‘correction’ field has no obvious physical interpretation. If, then, the whole plane
y — 0 were occupied by a perfectly conducting sheet, the field in the region y>0 would
consist of the incident wave (41), (42) together with a reflected wave

{Ee (O50; 1 create ec), (70)
| E’ = Z(—sina, —cos a, 0) ei*r cos(@+a), (71)
and there would be no field in y<0. When the conducting plate only occupies the area
y — 0,x> 0, there is an additional field which may be cast into the form (50), (51), (52) when
y 0 and into the form (58), (59), (60) when y<0. The requirement that the resultant £,

for the complete field should be continuous is automatically satisfied, and the boundary
