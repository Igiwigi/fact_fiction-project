in the case of Astronomy (which is par excellence the science of obseryation, and where
accordingly the lessons of experience are the clearest and most complete), will, I think,
at least, convince us of its reasonableness in certain large classes of errors of observations,
Now if we attend to what has taken place in the history of astronomical observation, we
find that the gross errors of the earlier observers proceeded mainly from three or four
principal causes—for instance, refraction, imperfect measurement of time, and the use
of the naked eye in pointing to objects. When these fery capital occasions of error were
removed (at least approximately), refraction being discovered and allowed for, and the
pendulum and telescopic sights introduced, it was found that observations at once
attained a high order of accuracy, showing that the principal sources of error had been
eliminated, It would seem, in fact, that in coarse and rude observations the errors
proceed from « very few principal causes; and in this case, consequently, our hypothesis
will probably represent the facts only imperfectly, and the frequency of the errors will
only approximate roughly and yaguely to the law which follows from itf. But when

*® The extreme simplicity of the exponential relation itself, whether considered as expressing the law of singlo
errors, or that of the mean results of a large number of observations, as contrasted with the long and difficult
methods by which it was etablished, has naturally led to several attempts to dispense with or simplify the
latter ; in some the hypothesis wo here adopt is taken as a basis ; but, 80 far as the present writer is aware,
every process giyen, except Porss0x's, fails in generality, In a recent Memoir on the Law of Frequeney of
Error by Professor Tarr (Edin, Trans, vol, xxiv.) (where, it should be stated, the learned author speaks with
8ome hexitation, and only gives his method as an attempt), it is as8umed that each of the elementary. errors
which are combined can be assimilated to tho deviation from its most probable value of the number of white
balls among a given large number of balls drawn from an urn, which contains white and black in a given pro-
portion, It is then shoyn (as indeed is done in Larrack's 3rd chapter) that this error follows the exponential
