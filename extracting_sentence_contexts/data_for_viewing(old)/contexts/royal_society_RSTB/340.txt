Caspian Sea whose affinities are rather with Phoca vitulina of the Arctic Ocean than
with P. fetida of the Mediterranean. It has also been supposed that this Aralo-
Caspian Sea had an eastward extension as far as Lake Balkhash. The reason for this
view is not easy to suggest, as none of the typical Aral fauna occur in Balkhash, nor
are any deposits of Aralian shells found between the two waters. It may be added
that Balkhash is bounded, both north and west, by very considerable hills, the
Koi Djarlegan, &e.

Moreover, apart from the question as to the extent of the hypothetical Aralo-
Caspian Sea, it has been suggested that the Aral Sea, at all events, has retired in recent
times from some considerable area, and is continuing to recede thus. This statement,
which occurs in several text-books, would appear to be only partially supported by the
facts which came within my own observations. In the summer and autumn of 1886,
I visited the whole north shore of the Aral Sea lying between Gulf Perofisky and
the mouth of the Syr Darya. From Togusken to Sary Cheganak the shore is formed
by high cliffs composed of horizontal beds of Eocene formation, containing fossils. Of
these I collected some 130 species, which have been examined by Mr. T. Roperrs, of St.
