strated by Mr D. G. Edgar’s work on the preserved material. It has sometimes been
suggested that the corpus luteum may lose its function some time before it regresses in size,
but the author inclines to the opinion that in some forms, including the elephant, the
corpus luteum may act as a reservoir from which hormone is slowly drained off, for some
time after the luteal tissue has been brought to a condition resembling extreme fatty
degeneration. Physical methods of identifying and estimating progesterone will doubtless
be applied to the corpus luteum of such animals as the cow at successive stages of pregnancy
and will have a bearing on this point. At present, however, the mode of action and
utilization of progesterone remains obscure.

Existing descriptions of the female reproductive organs have been reviewed in relation
to the present findings, and the marked discrepancies which characterize them have been
attributed to the fact that the authors were describing animals kept in captivity. It has

s been shown that some of the ways in which the descriptions vary may be attributed to
: varying degrees of retention of infantile characters in the reproductive organs of elephants
: in captivity. It may be added that it is difficult to estimate the age of an elephant in
2 captivity if the date of birth is not known, and African elephants in zoological gardens
: appear to differ from wild ones much more markedly in body conformation than do
4 Indian elephants.

é This investigation could not have been carried out without the co-operation and
4 financial help of the Uganda Protectorate Administration, and one of its aims was to
g provide information which could be taken into account in framing government policy
: with regard to the conservation of the elephant population and the sale of licences to
