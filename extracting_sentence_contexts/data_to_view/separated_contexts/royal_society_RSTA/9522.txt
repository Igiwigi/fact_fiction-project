The incidence of 2’s in the pulses is more alike if we invert
the order of days in the previous pulse, 7.e., regard days —25 and +25, &c., as
corresponding. But in both pulses the marked tendency is for days of moderate
disturbance to follow the crest. No significance probably attaches to the fact that 2’s
are slightly more numerous in the previous than in the subsequent pulse ; because,
while the highest “ character” figure in the first previous pulse exceeds that in the
first subsequent pulse in the case of the 11-year period, it does not do so in the
6-year period.

§16. Table VIIL., p. 265, represents the results of an enquiry into the possible varia-
tion of the 27-day period throughout the year. The 11-year and 6-year periods were
treated separately.
