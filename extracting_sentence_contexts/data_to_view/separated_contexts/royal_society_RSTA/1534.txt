As mentioned in the Methods section, our time measurement was subject to human error. Our
experience indicates that more results are unlikely to be reproduced in just a few additional hours
of work after 40. Further compounding uncertainty here is the fact that over time we gained skill
in reproducing these articles. It is possible that an hour of time on the last article we reproduced
was more productive than an hour of time spent on the first article.

6. Conclusion

In our experience, the articles and approaches studied in this work showcase widespread
issues with scientific code sharing throughout the scientific community.
