All the
primary tissues, vascular bundles, pericycle, inner and outer cortex are, as we should —
expect, perfectly continuous between stem and leaf. The limit between cortex and
pericycle is, however, difficult to trace at the point of junction. The sclerotic nests,
which in the stem are almost always limited to the pericycle, become distinctly —
cortical in the petiole, forming a conspicuous feature which helps to characterize
the species. + |

There is always a great development of these sclerotic masses in the axillary —
region, a fact which is worth noticing because these conspicuous groups of cells —
might be mistaken for rudimentary axillary buds. We find no evidence that —
such buds existed. Exactly below the axil a characteristic transverse hypodermal band of black —
sclerotic tissue is fourid (see photograph 4 and fig. 10).
