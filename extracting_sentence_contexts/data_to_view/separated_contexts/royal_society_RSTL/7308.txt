The corresponding values of & are

each of the points in question, viz. the points

is a node on the axis of x. % . «
12. It is to be observed that for m</2 the nodes are both imaginary ; for mz?

they coincide together at the point WET for m>y/2 they are both real : it is to be
further noticed that
node a=U(mb+a/m—2) corresponds to cos 8=}(m—V/m—2),
where (m being >4/2) the point (cos 0, sin 6) is a real point on the circle a* +y*=1 ;

in fact for m<4 (that is, m=x/2 to m=$) we have 1(m—a/m—2) <n, that is,

node xz=E(m—a/ n*—2) corresponds to cos 8=1(m+4/n*—2),

where (m being >4/2) the point (cos, 8in 9) is a real point on the circle a*+3*=1 80
long as m is not >3, that is, from m=+x+/2 to m=4Z; but if m>4, then the point in
question is an imaginary point on the circle—whence also the node a=Um—a/m*—2)
is an acnode or isolated point. In the case m=4 we have

node z=1 corresponding to cos {=4 or 9=60',
MT=y > cos 6=1 or 6=0?,
the last-mentioned point z=+ being in fact the point of union of two cusps in the case
m=3 now in question. Hence in this case we have at (7=+, y=0) a triple point equi-
valent to two cusps and a node; visibly, there is only a single branch cutting the axis
of © at right angles.

In the case m=x 2, the nodes coincide as above mentioned at the point 4=275 On

the axis; for this value of mz the coordinates of the cusps are

a=Ha/2 (=# VP which is <7) ; y=tvg

13. Starting from the equation 1024 (y—m)U=$8%—T2=0, it is clear that the cusps
are included among the intersections of the curves S=0, T=0; these two curves intersect
in 24 points which lie 9+9 at the circular points at infinity, 2+2 at the points 7z=m,
4—1=0, and 1-þ1 are the cusps, or points a=m—2n, = (1).
