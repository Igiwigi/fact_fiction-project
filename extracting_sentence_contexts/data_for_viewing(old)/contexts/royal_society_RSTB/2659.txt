are lens-like in shape and close together, appear to be at least two-leaved in
transverse sections, in some cases four-leaved, Whereas all septa in which the
trabecular axes are thread-like or rod-like in shape, and are not very close, appear
to be a single-leaf in transverse section, in some cases three-leaved (i.c., where the
deposit near the origin of fascicles differs in its crystalline setting from the deposit
more remote). But these appearances cannot lead with any security to a systematic
analysis of corals.

Thus, one must not be deceived by the appearances of Eupsammid transverse
sections. The affinity of this family is undoubtedly rather with the Astreide and
Fungide than with the Madreporide in spite of Epwarps and Hatnn’s classification
of it along with the last-named family among the “ Perforate” (antea, p. 201). And
this seems all the more reasonable in the light of the parallel fact that its Paleozoic
antetype, the Cystiphyllide, has marked affinities with the Palwozoic antetype of
the Astreidee and Fungide, namely, with the Cyathophyllidee.

The same fundamental feature which distinguishes the septa of Eupsammids gives
also the peculiar character to its wall, costal, and coenenchymal elements. The free
spine is everywhere the skeletal basis, and has given rise in a number of genera to
an irreguiar synapticular network around the periphery, where costal and basal
elements combine to build up a porous wall structure. The same elements extend
