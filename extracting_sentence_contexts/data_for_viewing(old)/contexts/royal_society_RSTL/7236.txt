On the hypothesis, p=0, g=1, we have

Symbol of chlorine «x},
Symbol of nitrogen «%*.
On the hypothesis, p=1, q=0, we have

Symbol of chlorine &*x*,

Symbol of nitrogen a.
Neither hypothesis is absolutely inconsistent with any known fact, for it is possible
thus to express the symbols of chlorine and nitrogen in every equation into which those
symbols enter; and if it were placed beyond doubt that the true density of chloride of
ammonium in the gaseous condition were 12:88, we might thus accept the fact and
assert that the factors x; and » were composite, 80 that either y=x? and »y=&%, or
y=c%% and y=1, and our view of the possible system of chemical substances, and of
rne laws of combination to which they were subject, would be profoundly modified. I


SIR B. C. BRODIE ON THE CALOULUS OF CHEMICAL OPERATIONS. 853

am far from believing that such is the true solution of this apparent anomaly. Such a
80lution, although not absolutely precluded to us, is in the highest degree improbable;
and the facts admit of an obvious and simple explanation on the hypothesis that chloride
of ammonium is decomposed, at the temperature at which its vapour-density is 8upposed
to have been taken, into equal volumes of hydrochloric acid and ammonia, of which very
