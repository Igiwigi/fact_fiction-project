In every respect the identity is
& perfect: in the structure of the primary wood, the character and arrangement of the
= secondary tissues, the details of the cortex, and especially in the characteristic
& external zone, termed the “epidermal layer” in previous memoirs. * In all the
3 points, in fact, by which Kaloxylon Hookeri was characterized, the roots of Lygino-
= dendron show an exact agreement with that fossil. If, after the consideration of this specially clear case, we refer back to photographs

& 8, 9, and 10, we shall see that the roots there figured are of the same nature, though

_ their Kaloaylon structure is less obvious, owing to slight modifications in that part

of the root, which passes through the cortex of the stem. As regards the distribution of the adventitious roots on the stem, we have little to
i. add to what has already been said.
