arranged as in figure 13. And in consequence of the various
distance of the prism from the mirror, the distance of the
several images of the candle, will increase and decrease, 80
that when at last, the end A C is again set down on the
mirror, they will apparently coalesce into one single bright
image.

The use that may be made of these experiments is as fol-
lows. From the laws of reflection we know, that the extent
of the multiplied images perceived in reiterated reflections,
between two surfaces, may at all times be ascertained when
their distance is given. It is also well known, that when two
plates are in what is called contact, we can in fact, only sup-
pose them to be extremely near each other. 'The production
of streaks, when a plain glass is laid under a prism, is a suf-
ficient proof that, even when they are in the closest contact
which can be made, the subjacent surface till acts by reflection
upon the rays that pass through the base of the prism ; for
if the contact of the two surfaces were s0 complete as to
make one solid mass of glass, no reflection would take place
within its substance.

LX. Of the breadth of the Streaks compared to that of the Bows,
and the Cause why they must take up a broader Space than the
Bows from which they are derived.
