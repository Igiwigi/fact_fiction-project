when saturated with water as low as from 14* to 22%, The angle of repose of the com-
bined s0il and stones would therefore depend on the relative proportion of the seyeral
materials, and on the amount of saturation.

Therefore the angle of repose of the mass of detritus 8et in motion would, as the
water drained from it, tend to become greater ; and as an equilibrium was established,
commencing on the upper part of the slope first left uncovered, that part would be
gradually stayed, while the portion, on the contrary, which continued to slide would,
on the lake coming to rest, bulge forward at the water-level, where ib had its maximum
saturation, at a minimum angle of repose.

Owing to the variable nature and proportions of its elements, the problem is a very
complicated one. The angles of the detrital slopes between the © roads” are, in fact,
dependent both on the gradients of the underlying rock surfaces, and on the above-
mentioned varying conditions of the detritus ; while the angle of inclination of the
* roads” is dependent on the combined effects of an arrested slide, and a simultaneous
change of the state of equilibrium in the falling detrital mass, above and below the
water-line.

The effects of these slides is represented generally in diagram fig. 11.
