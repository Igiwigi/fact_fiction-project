Let T be a subclassical recursively enumerable set theory. If T is extensible, then the 1a
propositional logic of T is intuitionistic propositional logic IPC, i.e. L(T) = IPC. :&

Let us first observe the following helpful fact. Recall that a theory T has the disjunction gs
property whenever TF g Vv y implies TF g or TF yp. Lemma 4.6.
