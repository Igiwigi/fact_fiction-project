,
H and it is easy by means of a preceding formula to verify the equation O =F—27F*
Z 139. The formulz show a very remarkable analogy between the covariants of a cubic
= and the invariants of a quartic. In fact—
= For the cubic. For the quartic.
2 A=(8—y)(v—ay), A=(B—7)(«—d),
5 B=(y—ea—Py), B=(y—e)(B—3),
E C=(a—BY(w—7y), C=(u—BN(y—d).
ij And then we have corresponding to each other—
EZ For the cubic.
