by swinging the same sphere (brass) first in air and afterwards in water. The
result of the experiments, by both these methods, showed that the usual cor-
rection for the reduction to a vacuum was much too small ; and that the true
correction was nearly double what has been generally assumed. The first
method gaye 1'946*, and the second 1-625, as the factor by which the old
correction must be multiplied in order to obtain the true correction. These
values differ materially from each other ; but M. BesssL prefers the former,
as his investigations are founded on the theory that the vibrations are made in
a medium of yery small densityF.

Being desirous of ascertaining, by a different process, the true yalue of the
correction for the numerous and yarious pendulums in my possession, as accu-
rately as experiments of this kind will decide the fact, and considering the

* In a paper, subsequently inserted in the Astronomische Nachrichten, No. 223, M. BxssxL has in-
creased this value to 1956,

+ M. Brsszs also swung a hollow brass cylinder alternately in air and in water, and has deduced
zome rexults which appear to be astounding : but, I shall show in the sequel that the discordaney in

the results stated by him, will be removed by the assumption of a different specific gravity of the
moving body, from that which he has adopted.
