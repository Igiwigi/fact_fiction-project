The primate retina with its inhomogeneous
objects can be broken into two parts. The first part of a structure has a much higher resolution in the centre, the
proto-object refers to its visual features/categories within fovea, than in the periphery [25]. This anatomical fact can be
the ventral and dorsal stream (e.g. maps of V1, V2, V4, MT, seen as one reason for the high occurrence of saccadic eye
etc.). The second part of a proto-object is represented movements (three to four times per second) to potential infor-
within a priority map [7]) and refers to an early spatially mative retinal locations (e.g. informative for the current task;
extended representation of a tentative external objectâ€”here [37]). Given a biased competition framework, the question
called a priority map region.
