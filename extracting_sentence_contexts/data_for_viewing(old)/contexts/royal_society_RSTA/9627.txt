The form of the variation of the total rate of emission of ions, plus atoms from the
surface, given in fig. 8, has similar characteristics to that given by Taytor and
Lanomurr for caesium on tungsten. The emission rises to a maximum, falls to a
minimum, and again rises sharply. It was first pointed out by Becker that such a
curve showed that either of two phases of the adsorbed layer, such as those repre-
sented by the points B and C, could be in stable equilibrium with a bombarding
stream of intensity represented by OA. In non-equilibrium experiments with caesium
on tungsten when the concentration of the adsorbed layer falls below a certain value
the layer does break up into two phe Although in the present experiments the
depth of the minimum in the total emission curve is of a different order of magnitude
from that for caesium on tungsten, the curve is of the form which might lead to the
growth of two phases. The fact that the adsorbed atoms remain on the field in a
uniform phase must be due to the rate of diffusion being sufficiently rapid to prevent
the appearance of a dilute phase.
