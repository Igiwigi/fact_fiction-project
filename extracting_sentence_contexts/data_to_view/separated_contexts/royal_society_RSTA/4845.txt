Because large-scale first-order optimization algorithms are seeing many new developments at :s

present, it is likely that there either exists or will be a better alternative to algorithm 1. In fact, we 5S

invite the interested reader to find such an alternative, which can have an important impact on

CT imaging! For example, as will be seen shortly, algorithm 1 has limited success for phantom

recovery studies for P; on systems of realistic size.

(c) Algorithm issues

We demonstrate first some of the challenges in carrying out large-scale recovery studies by
applying algorithm 1 to a medium-scale problem using an Ngiqe = 128 version of the structure
walnut phantom. The phantom has a gradient-domain sparsity of 1826 and a pixel sparsity of
2664 out of a total of 11620 pixels.
