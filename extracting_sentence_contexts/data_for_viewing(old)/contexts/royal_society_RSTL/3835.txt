its resemblance to the former in external aspect and plan of growth, it is far more
closely allied to the latter in those features of its organization which indicate its
physiological condition. It has been shown that in Orbitolites the communication
between the different portions of the sarcode-body is s0 free, that the whole may be
regarded as a continuous mass in which the segmental division is but imperfectly
indicated («| 67); and this view is in complete harmony with the fact, that every
addition made to the sbelly disk forms (save in a few rare cases) an entire annulus.
In Cycloclypeus, on the other hand, the chambers are 80 completely separated from
each other laterally, that no other communication exists between them than snch as
may be established by the interseptal canals; and the communications between the
chambers forming successive annuli, are only large enough to allow the passage of
narrow bands of sarcode. Hence we see that there is here as much segmental inde-
pendence as is consistent with the existence of these animals, which involyes the
maintenance of a communication between the innermost and ontermost chambers,
for the transmission of nutriment to the segments of the sarcode-body contained
within the former. And this independence is strikingly manifested, by the frequency
with which incomplete annuli are added to the previous margin of the disk, extend-
ing (it may be) along not more than a third, a half, or two-thirds of the entire cireum-
