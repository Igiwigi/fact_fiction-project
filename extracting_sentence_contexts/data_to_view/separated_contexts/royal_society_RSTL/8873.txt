E On the 12th of February a closed chamber of three tubes was charged with cucumber-
& infusion. Heated discontinuously in the manner described, and abandoned afterwards
5 to a warm temperature, the three tubes remained perfectly sterile.
= Any process competent to sterilize very old hay can sterilize with greater ease any
a other infusion. The fact, therefore, that only a few days ago three closed chambers
= charged with our most refractory hay-infusions were sterilized by discontinuons heating
= proves the power of the method over infusions of all kinds. By this method very instructive comparative experiments might be made, and the
.S resistant power of different germs might be expressed in terms of the heatings necessary
S for their sterilization. I possess, for example, two test-tubes, containing the same infusion
V and associated with the s2me closed chamber, one of which has been heated five times
= and the other s8ix.
