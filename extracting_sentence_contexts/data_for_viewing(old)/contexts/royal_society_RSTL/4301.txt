danger of drawing near the shores of Cardigan or Caernaryon Bays, with particular
tides and scant winds, and 80 likewise of the danger of standing close to the banks
skirting the Irish coast in light winds.

But it is not to the navigator alone that these observations will, I hope, be found
useful : they will, I think, be interesting to men of science. Taken in connection
with the very valuable series of observations which were carried round Ireland by
the Ordnance at the snggestion of Professor Airy, we are made acquainted with
several curious facts : first, that whilst it is high water at one end of the channel, it

I = the same time; that there are two spots in the channel, in one of which the stream
SN runs with considerable velocity without the water either rising or falling, and in the
5 other, that the water rises and falls from sixteen to twenty feet without having any
bg visible horizontal motion of its surface; and that during the first half of the flowing,
