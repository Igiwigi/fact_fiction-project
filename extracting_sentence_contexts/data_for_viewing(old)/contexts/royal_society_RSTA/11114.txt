310 MR. G. UDNY YULE ON THE ASSOCIATION

boys increasing by half; the percentage of dull also increases largely. One can only
conclude that these defects, whether inherited or not, are not “innate” in the simple
sense of being observable at birth or during early infancy ; possibly they may be
brought on in part by the school attendance itself, a theory which would account
for the sudden rise after “ Infancy,” or rather early childhood. As for the subsequent
decreases in the percentages of all defects, I am inclined to attribute them, in part
at all events, to the selection by capacity that must take place. This would reduce
the percentage of “mentally dull,” and, owing to the association between defects,
would also reduce indirectly the percentages of those with other defects. A proportion
of the decrease one would expect to take place from natural selection, but probably
a small proportion. We have, in fact, selective mortality, selection by mental
capacity, and growth (change in the individual), all acting together as causes of
change—and very probably also initial differences between the groups from which
the older and younger children sprang—precisely as was indicated in the previous
discussion on pp. 299-300.

§ 63. In the association coefficients there is,however, no irregularity in the group
Standards I-III. ; the most cursory inspection of Tables IV. and V. shows that the
total coefficients and partial coefficients with negative universes decrease when we
pass from “Infants” to the next group, and again from Standards I.—III. to the next
group. The changes in partial associations with positive or defective universes are
not so obvious, partly, no doubt, because these coefficients are small and have large
probable errors, but the majority of the changes are in the same direction. Table VII.
