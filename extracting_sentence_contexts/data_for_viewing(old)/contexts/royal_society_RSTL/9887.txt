and the identity of the logarithmic decrement with that of dry air shows that this 8mall
quantity of water has no appreciable action on the viscosity. When the pump is set
to work the air is gradually removed, whilst the aqueous vapour is kept supplied from
the reservoir of liquid. As the exhaustion approaches the tension of aqueous vapour,
evaporation goes on at a greater rate, and the vapour displaces the air with increasing
rapidity ; until, after the pressure of 12'7 millims. is passed, the aqueous vapour acts
as a gas, and, being constantly snpplied from the reservoir of water (as long as it
lasts), washes out all the air from the apparatus, the logarithmic decrement rapidly
sinking to that of pure water gas.

This explanation requires bhat the viscosity of pure aqueous vapour should be the
same as that of hydrogen, at all events between 7 millims. and 1 millim. pressure.
The facts can, however, be explained in another way. During the action of the
SPRENGEL pump sufficient electricity is 80metimes generated to render the fall tubes
Inminous in the dark (52). Tt is conceivable that under 8uch electrical influence
the falling mercury may be able to decompose aqueous vapour at these high exhaustions,
with formation of oxide of mercury and liberation of hydrogen. Of these two theories
the latter appears to be the more probable, but T have not sufficient data to enable me
to decide between them.

703. The presence of water vapour shows itself likewise in the very slight amount
of repulsion produced by radiation. Repulsion commences in air at a pressure of
12 millims., whilst at a higher exhaustion the maximum effect rises to over 40
divisions, Here, however, repulsion does not, begin till the exhaustion is higher than
the barometer gauge will indicate, whilsb the maximum action after long-continued
