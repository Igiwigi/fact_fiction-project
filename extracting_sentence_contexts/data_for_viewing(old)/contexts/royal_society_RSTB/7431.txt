EARLY EMBRYONIC STAGES OF PERIPATOPSIS 513

condensation of the embryo (figure 78, plate 38) results in the appearance of a double-
layered sphere, vacuolated endoderm being present throughout. The nuclei of both ecto-
derm and endoderm are now closer together and the cells are deeper as a result of the
general shrinkage (see longitudinal section, figure 110, plate 40).

The ‘giant cell’ described above entirely disappears during this condensation of the
embryo, leaving no trace. It is possible that the two events are correlated, neither giant cell
nor shrinkage of the vesicle occurs in P. moseleyi or P. sedgwicki, and the giant cell has never
been found after the sudden condensation of the embryo. No further facts concerning this cell
have been obtained. Possibly it is a gland cell which influences the osmotic relations of the
embryo, and on discharge causes a reduction in the osmotic pressure within the vesicle and
consequently the shrinkage. The mouth-anus opens just after the shrinkage (see p. 517),
but appears to be closed until then by a fine sheet of protoplasm, and so its opening cannot
cause the reduction in internal pressure.

Thus the condensed embryo, lacking germ bands, is lined throughout by endoderm.
This layer remains distinct from the superficial tissues at all later stages (figures 110 to 112,
plate 40). No further additions to it by immigration from the blastoporal area could be
found, and further growth takes place by mitoses; it is possible that a small amount of
immigration too slow to be detected may take place from the anterior end of the blastoporal
area, but no major immigration of endoderm occurs. Endoderm formation thus ceases
