limited to either the Silurian or the Devonian. Its Silurian age was suggested by two
considerations. The first is the general resemblance of this series, with its beds of
rarely fossiliferous limestone and red quartzites, to the Muth Series of Spiti (cf. HaypEn,
1904, p. 24) in the central Himalaya. The second is the possibility that the Minchia
Series might be earlier than the Middle Devonian and separated from the limestones
of that epoch by a strong unconformity ; this conclusion was suggested by the presence
in the Stromatopora limestone at Lan-shueh-ko of a veined limestone pebble, which was
at first regarded as the Minchia limestone ; if it were so, the Minchia limestone would
have been fractured and veined before the deposition of the Stromatopora limestone.
As, however, that coral reef lies against a bank of older limestones, the pebble may
have come from them.

The post-Silurian age of the Minchia limestone is indicated by the following facts :—
First, the nearest Silurian beds to the Minchia Series are the graptolitic slates at Shih-
tien, about 22 miles 8.8.E. of Pu-piao, which underlie a limestone that, according to
Mr. Brown’s description (1913—3, p. 331), appears to be the Minchia limestone.
These graptolitic slates being Llandovery in age, do not, however, preclude the Minchia
beds belonging to the Middle or Upper Silurian. Secondly, farther to the S.H. the
Silurian beds of Tongking and eastern Yunnan offer no resemblance to the Minchia
Series, while the Devonian there are shallow water or terrestrial beds, and are consistent
with geographical conditions in north-western Yunnan suitable for the deposition of
the Minchia Series. Thirdly, we failed to find graptolites in the black shales associated
with the limestone, a negative argument which, if worth anything, would be against
the Silurian age of the series, whereas the only fossils found are Devonian in affinity.
Fourthly, the abundance of associated igneous rocks and frequent interstratification
