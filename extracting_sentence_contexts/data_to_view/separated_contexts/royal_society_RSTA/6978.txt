Coming back to the deviations from the linear law, we notice first that P, and C,,H,
follow the linear law to the lowest supersaturations observed. That means that Â¢, is smaller
than 10-3, and therefore, from (48), that x, >10*a. This is not surprising; in fact, the estimate
of x,/a made in I, equation (6), is valid for spherical molecules, for which the energy of
evaporation W; of an adsorbed molecule was assumed to be of the order of }W; in the case of
a flat molecule like C,)H,, we expect W; to be larger, and therefore x,/a will also be larger. Figure 9 gives the results (logarithmic scale for both axes) obtained by Volmer & Schultze
on several I, crystals. The experimental rates of growth are not reproducible even for the
same face of the same crystal; this is not unexpected on the basis of the present theory.
