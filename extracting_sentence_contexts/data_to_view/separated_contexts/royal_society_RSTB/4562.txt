labour was necessary to secure so many, they are so well protected by thick
membranes that the labour of collection is comparatively slight. The tissue of the
tumour was teased as finely as possible, and then moistened and rubbed lightly with
the finger in a mortar, until the pieces were reduced to about the size of coarse sand
grains. Sporangia separate from tissue more readily than cell from cell, and upon
this fact the following rubbing and filtering processes depend. By filtering through
muslin, the larger pieces of tissue were held back, and the filtrate, containing groups
of sporangia, was poured into a funnel covered with ordinary silk. This was then
spread on a flat dish, and the sporangia were again rubbed with the finger.
