diapause and, on the one hand, temporary and readily reversible arrests in development
brought about by changes in the environment, and, on the other hand, the permanent
cessation of growth and possible alteration of the course of development which result in the
production of weakly individuals, teratological specimens [e.g. prothetely and metathetely
(Singh Pruthi 1924)], or of definite castes within the same species. Each case must be
carefully studied (as has been done by Kevan (1944) with Diatraea lineolata Wlk.) before
a decision can be made as to whether an arrest in development should be considered a state
of true diapause.

It is thus difficult to set exact limits to the state to which the term diapause should be
applied. There is, too, a wide variety of.factors which tend to induce this condition—cold,
heat, desiccation, excess humidity, deficient nutrition, excess nutrition (Baumberger 1914),
asphyxiation, etc. In fact, any wide departure from the optimum conditions for a particular
stage of a given species may induce diapause at that time, or, more usually, at a later period
in development.

The possibility has been pointed out by Cousin (1932) that abnormal conditions acting
on the parent may be an underlying cause of diapause in the progeny, weakly parents

producing weakly offspring more sensitive to an unfavourable environment, with higher
than average mortality, and with a greater proportion of individuals going into diapause.
This she has shown for Lucilia, and it has also been seen to occur with the single generation
