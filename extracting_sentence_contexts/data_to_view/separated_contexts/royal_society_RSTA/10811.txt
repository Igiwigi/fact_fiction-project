If we do not make all the above conditions, we easily obtain a number of coeffi-
cients which would vanish with the transfer. Thus for example the correlation 4 of
Equation (xxxviii.) is such an expression.* It has the advantage of a symmetrical
form, and has a concise physical meaning. It does not, however, become unity when

either, but not both, b and ¢ vanish, nor does it, unless we multiply it by 7/2 and
take its sine, equal the coefficient of correlation when a = d and b = e,
Again, we might deduce a fairly simple approximation to the coeflicient of correla-
tion from the Equation (xxiv.) for @, using only its first few terms. Thus we find

as an expression which vanishes with the transfer, and will be fairly close to the
coefficient of correlation.
