strain, no matter what number of sections there may be at which that strain has a maxi-
mum value. For example, in the © Victoria and Albert” there are two sections of maxi-
mum hogging-moment (ec and ad! in Plate XVI. fig. 7), but the absolute maximum is
found in the fore body; while in the © Bellerophon” and © Audacious* (sﬆe Plate XVII.
figs. 9 & 10) the absolute maximum is found in the after body. In cases 8uch as the
* Minotaur's,' where there is only one section of water-borne division, that is, of course
— the section of maximum bending. Attention has previously been drawn to the fact that
- in such caxes the sections of maximum bending (such as @ ' in Plate XVII. fig. 8) usually
lie very near the middle of the length; and many writers on the subject, considering
the distribution of weight and buoyancy too exclusively, refer to the midship section
X as being most severely strained. For still water, however, I have shown above that this
a is by no means true in many ships; and it is only proper to add that some authors of
standing have recently put forward views on this point which are not borne out by my
= calculations. For example, even Professor RANKINE, speaking of a ship that tends to
= hog in till water, says*:—* Let M be a transverse section which divides the ship into
<£ two parts, each separately water-borne (and which is seldom far from the midship sec-
S tion); then at the section M .....
'2 on he adds, * in the case of a ship that tends to sag amidships the greatest bending-
Z moment is till at M ..... . being a sagging-moment instead of a hogging-moment.”
