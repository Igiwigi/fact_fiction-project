Barnes carried out the heating, in air, to 800° C. He restored heated hornblende to
its original colour and optical condition by reheating it in hydrogen. Kennedy and
Dixon found that similar changes in an amphibole heated in air to 1000° C. were
produced by the driving off of water (at several stages), but did not comment on the
fact that their conclusions clashed with the views of Barnes and Winchell. Neither
did they discuss the ratio of the percentages of ferric to ferrous iron in their analyses;
in the unheated amphibole it is 0-54: 7-99, while in the brown hornblende produced
by heating it is 9-70: 0-17. There has clearly been either oxidation or auto-oxidation.
