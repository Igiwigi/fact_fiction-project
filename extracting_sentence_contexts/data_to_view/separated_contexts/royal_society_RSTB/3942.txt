In these experiments
Lane crossed Helix hortensis and H. nemoralis, where the parents are red and
yellow. In the F, generation he got a ratio of 3 yellow: 1 red, but as they grew
older this changed into a ratio of 3 red: 1 yellow. Moore (64) in a recent paper
has drawn attention to this fact with regard to the inheritance of skeleton characters
in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus % x S. franciscanus $. In all cases he found the
development of characters such as spinousness, length of arms, and body shape, was
much retarded in the hybrids. He suggests that, as only half the substance that
produces the characters in the pure forms is present in the hybrids, their development
will necessarily be much slower.
