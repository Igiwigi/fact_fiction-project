It extends in a narrow layer on either side of this process of the
fin, which gives off a number of dentinal projections, which serve to support the
glandular tissue. Tn the tissue beneath these processes are to be seen large masses of pigment cells ;
another parallel to the condition in Trygon at the commencement of the gland. In
fact, if we imagine the central septum to become impregnated with dentine and
enlarged, we should have an arrangement of gland on either side of a median ridge,
as in Trygon. The only difference would be that, whereas in Trygon there is one
epithelial mass, here there is a marked follicular gland with a primitive type of duct. If we now examine the secreting portion of the gland under an oil immersion lens,
