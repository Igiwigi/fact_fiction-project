cb is a function of the height, approximately one half. The length of the other
diagonal vom is largely determined by the length of the skull, and thus the
magnitude of the foramino-basal angle may be brought into relation with the
altitudinal index ; this, which is obtained by dividing the height by by the maximum
length, is given in the last column of the last table. On reference it will be seen
that the correlation we have inferred actually exists; the three skulls with the
smallest foramino-basal angles (see table, p. 306) have the highest altitudinal index,
and the three with the lowest altitudinal index have the largest foramino-basal angle.
The two skulls Nos, 994 and 995 fall nearly into line, but their foramino-basal angles
are not so closely approximate as their altitudinal indices: the divergence being due
to the fact that the polar angle of the gasion point is greater in 994 than in 995.

As a result of this long discussion, we seem to have elicited the fact that within
the limits of the human race the magnitude of the foramino-basal angle stands in no
necessary connection with the morphological status. It is determined in the first
place by the relative growth of the brain and face, in the next it depends not only on
the amount but on the manner of the cerebral increase, so that when the brain is

deficient in altitude and a low skull results the foramino-basal angle may be larger
than when the brain attains a full and symmetrical development.
