more integrated working between researchers is needed, and
that catchment-scale manipulations and networks of long-
term experimental burn sites are urgently required. Working
in partnership with land managers, fire professionals and
other non-academic stakeholders to co-produce knowledge is
another approach to extend the spatial and temporal range of
data collection, incorporate local knowledge and build trust
[148,149].

Recent reviews (e.g. [35]) have drawn attention to the very
substantial knowledge gaps that remain with regard to the
effects of fire on peatland ecosystems. We do not dispute the
fact that fire causes a range of ecological and environmental
changes—some of which are less welcome than others and
have a mixture of costs and benefits. There is, however, very
considerable uncertainty, and knowledge is missing in several
key areas. Ongoing research in the UK is certainly not being
helped by the fact that several studies seem to be operating
in a vacuum where understanding from wildland fire science
and peatland ecology more generally is missing and leading
to methodological and interpretational errors. In particular
here is the argument from wildland fire scientists in the USA
(e.g. [150,151]) and Mediterranean (e.g. [152,153]) that fire
exclusion (or the ‘over-suppression paradigm’) allows fuels to
accumulate and ultimately increases fire intensity and burn
