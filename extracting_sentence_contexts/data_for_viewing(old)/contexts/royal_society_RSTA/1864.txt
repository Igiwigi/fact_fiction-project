neutrino theory. The measurement of pp! neutrinos thus confirms, in quantitative detail, our : S

theoretical understanding of the interior of the Sun. More broadly, detection of solar neutrinos
confirms that the Sun is powered by nuclear fusion. Element transformation illuminates the
cosmos!

We have only been able to detect the neutrinos from hydrogen fusion from the Sun, because
the fluxes of neutrinos from any other star are far too small. The conclusion that other stars are
also powered by nuclear fusion rests on copious indirect evidence and well-understood physics
and is rooted in the powerful Copernican assumption that the Sun is an ordinary star.

The detection of the ppl neutrinos at the expected rate also shows that the Sun will be shining
for at least the next 200000 years, as the energy now generated leaks out. In fact, the Sun will live
for much longer, undergoing drastic changes and producing other elements, to which we now
turn.

3. Dying low-mass stars make heavy elements

Confidence: Certain

The presence of the radioactive elements thorium and uranium in the Earth’s crust not only
gave the first measurement of the solar system’s true age [21,22], but also demonstrated that
the elements must have been produced in the finite past [23]. Because estimates of the age of the
Universe in 1950, based on its current size and expansion rate, were close to the Earth’s measured
age, Alpher & Hermann proposed that they were made in the hot, dense Universe at the very
