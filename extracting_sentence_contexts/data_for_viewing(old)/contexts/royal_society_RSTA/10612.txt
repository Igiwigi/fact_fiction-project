of a definite branch of that function. But a true asymptotic series has no area of
convergence, and any meaning which we care to attach to it will harmonise with
Wererstrass’ theory of functions.

The essential nature of the difference between the two kinds of series may be
brought out in another way. A series convergent for sufficiently small values
of |z| represents a function regular in the neighbourhood of the origi. But any
function which a true asymptotic series can represent will have the origin as an
essential singularity. And, therefore, not only can many functions with an essential
singularity at the origin have the same asymptotic expansion, but also the same
function may have different asymptotic expansions in different areas having the
origin as apex. It is almost impossible to imagine a vagary which an essential
singularity will not possess, and this fact we cannot, throughout the whole of the
investigation, too carefully bear in mind.

Inasmuch as any means of regarding an asymptotic series leads to a result peculiar
to that means, we must choose our process with care so as to obtain the most simple
result, and, if possible, so as to ensure that our conception of such series agrees with
the arithmetic point of view by which historically they were generated.

§ 29. Suppose, in the first place, that we have given the asymptotic series

iy 2 + ge? +... tae +...,

in which, by Caucuy’s rule, Lt 4a, = ©. And suppose further that Lt oe =
