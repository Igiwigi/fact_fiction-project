respectively. As the sections N and N can be naturally identified with the bases B and B, the
map ¢:B— B induces a natural map between N and N which we denote by the same letter
@:NON. For any point yeT x B, we can find (not uniquely!) (t;(y), to(y)) € R? such that
x=olhW2)(y) € N. Consider the map ® : T? x B > T? x B defined by

Corollary 6.5. The map ©® is well defined and is a fibrewise real-analytic diffeomorphism satisfying
&*(2)=2


Proof. The fact that ® is well defined (i.e. does not depend on the choice of (t,t2) € R? with El
the property o""2)(y) € N) follows from lemma 6.4. To show that @ is a symplectomorphism, i.e.
*(2) = 2, we note that the position of each point y € T? x B is defined by the values of H, F “3
(which can be understood as coordinates on B) and fy, t2 (which can be understood as coordinates :
on the torus T? with the ‘origin’ (0,0) located on N). These four functions define a canonical
coordinate system, i.e.

2Q=dH A dt +dF A dt.

A similar canonical coordinate system AF, t,, fy can be defined on T? xB by using the action &
and the Lagrangian section N. It remains to note that our map @ in these coordinate systems, by

construction, takes the form H =H, F =F, t} =t, bb =to. a
