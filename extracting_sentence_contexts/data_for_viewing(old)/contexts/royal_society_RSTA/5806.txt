and Q= (—1024q° + 384(m — 4)q° + 24(m* + 10m — 20)q — (m + 2)(7m* — 17m 8)) (A12)

where q = A(m — 1) = Aa(m — 1).
Here, W = —A, where A is discriminant corresponding to (A 1). We get
W = 32(m — 1)>m(m — 2)(A — da)(A — Ac)(A — Aa), (A 13)

where Aq, Ac, Aq are defined in (3.26), (3.27), (3.28), respectively.

It is known that for A > 0 equation (A 1) has three different real solutions, while for A < 0 it
has only one real solution. For A = 0, we have either (i) two different real solutions (two roots are
coinciding) or ii) one real solution (all three roots are coinciding). One can readily verify that these
facts confirm the classification of the number of solutions presented in §3 (up to exclusion of one
of the solutions for 4 = 4g corresponding to x = xq.) We note that the case A = 0 takes place when
A =A; for some i=a,c,d. In the subcase (ii) we obtain solutions x = x, =1 (for w <0, A =A,) and
X=Xqg=X_ = —2 (for a > 0,m =4 and A=4, = 4g = 1/4), which are forbidden by our restrictions.

For Aa =A =0, we obtain W = 32(m — 1)3m(m — 2)(—Ag)Acdg > 0 for m> 2 or A <0. Hence in
this case, we have only one real solution to the master equation which is in agreement with our
graphical analysis from §3. This solution takes place only for a > 0.
