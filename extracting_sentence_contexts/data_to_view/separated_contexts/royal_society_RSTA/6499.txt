Kopprn,* to explain the daily inequalities of wind direction an
velocity—inequalities which are opposite in phase over plains and on high mountain
peaks. In the sequel it will be shown that it probably suffices to clear up all
anomalies observed in the wind system of India. The explanation of the dryness of
these winds by the descent of air from a higher stratum was previously suggested by
Minry, in a passaget quoted by BLanrorp at p. 614 of his paper on the “ Winds of
Northern India” ; but this was under the mistaken notion of an aérial cascade pouring
over the edge of the Himalaya from the elevated plains of Thibet, a notion which is
quite inconsistent with the facts of observation. . A general idea of the average relations of pressure and wind direction over the
Indian area will be obtained from Plate 19, on which have been charted the mean
isobaric lines and the resultant wind directions at the more important observing
stations, for the months of January, May, July, and October, typical respectively of
the cold, the hot, and the rainy season, and the autumn transition period. Th
pressures used in drawing the charts are the means for ten years, published in the
Report on the Meteorology of India for 1884.
