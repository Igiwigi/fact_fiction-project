negative criteria) in all of their judgements first, and only
later do they use more practical, non-evaluative criteria. In
the dimensionality approach, both models—the FFM and
PNA—use descriptors derived from human judgements,
which universally suffer from evaluative bipolarity. When
FA is applied to such data, the evaluative biases of descrip-
tors will guarantee the creation of valence-based categories
missing non-evaluative features of the real structure of the
systems that humans are evaluating. This evaluative bias cre-
ates the first impression that OR-MA teams (for example,
KOPr—NA or DOPr/MOPr-DA) are neurophysiological cor-
relates of Negative and Positive Affects, or Neuroticism and
Extraversion, and overshadows the fact that there are at
least three, and not two OR-MaA teams, and that functional-
ity of either OR or MA extends beyond emotionality or
socialization (i.e. includes orientation, initiation, prioritiza-
tion, analgesic effects, etc.).

For example, Impulsivity was long noted to be a part of
Extraversion [106,107] but it is often associated with Negative,
and not Positive Affect. As another example, the Sensation
Seeking trait initially was a facet of the factor of Extraversion
(unified with the Positive Affect dimension) whereas high Sen-
sation Seeking is associated with complaints of boredom and a
need for fast ‘mood-fixers’ (i.e. with Negative Affect). In fact,
