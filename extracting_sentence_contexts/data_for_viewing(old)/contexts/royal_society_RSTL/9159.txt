$ 6. Effects of Temperature on Rhythm. (a). —The effects of temperature on the
rhythm of Meduse are very decided. For instance, a specimen of Sarsia which in 81c-
cexsive minutes gave the following numbers of pulsations—16, 26, 0, 0, 26, gave 60 pul-
sations during the next minute, while a spirit-lamp was held under the water in which
the Medusa was swimming. If hot water be added to that in which Sqrs/@ are contained
until the whole is about milk-warm, their swimming-motions become frantic. If the

A 8ame experiment be performed after the margins of the Sars/@ have been removed,
Y the paralyzed bells remain quite passive, while the severed margins exhibit the frantic
E motions just alluded to.
by In the case of Aurelia aurita the characteristic effects of temperature on rhythm may
= be better studied than in that of Sars/a, from the fact that the natural motions are more
=D rThythmical and 8ustained in the former than in the latter genus, TI have therefore, in
bn] . 7 o 154 .
SB this connexion, made more observations on Aurelia than on Sarsia. The following,
S| quoted from my notes, may be taken at a typical experiment —
Z * A 8mall and active specimen of Aurelia contracted with the greatest regularity 33
S times per minute in water kept at 34"; but on transference to water kept at 49®, the
S contractions always became irregular, in respect («) of not having a perfectly constant
'S thythm, and (5) of exhibiting frequent pauses, which was never the case in colder water.
= The rate of rhythm in the warmer water varied from 37 to 49; and, as in these obser-
2 vations no allowance was made for the occurrence of the pauses, the actual rate of
[= rhythm during the swimming-motions was about 60 per minute. The following are
= some 8ample observations in the case of this specimen :—
