Conversely, any slight outward moyement of
the tripus that might subsequently take place would at first only have the effeot of
straightening, as it were, by a pull, the outwardly bulging fibres of the ligament. Hence, it may be coneluded that relatively slight inenrsions or exonrsions of the
anterior process of the tripns will produce no effect on the svaphinm, and that only
movements of the tripus, of greater atoplitude than those now under consideration, are
competent to bring about corresponding moyements of the seaphium, or affeet the
fluids of the internal ear, But, apart from the interossicnlar ligament, there are other
reasons for the belief which we certainly entertain, that the Weberiau ossicles are but
ill-adapted for the transmission of movements caused by the slight inward or outward
lulying or vibration of the lateral walls of the anterior chamber. The size of the
Weberian ossicles, or at all events, of the tripus; the character of the articulation
hetween the articular process of the tripus and the centrum of the third vertebra,
which, in some Siloridse (eg., Auehenipterus nodosus and 21. obsewris) is effected by
the actual but flexible continuity af that process with the cevirur in question; and
the fact that all movements of the ossicles, or at least of the tripus, must take place
in the loove, fluid-infiltrated connective tissue of the saccus paravertebralis—seem to
qflord strong additional eyidence that the Weberian apparatus is far better adapted
to regieter the more forcible, even if more gradual distensions or contractions of the
anterior chamber, rather than slight or ripidly recurring vilrwtions of ifs lateral
wills. Aniong other facts tending to the same conclusion may be mentioned the
extreme thickness of the walls of te air-bladder in maxy Silwoids, and in certam
genera and species (Osteogeniosus, Klurichthys, and several species of Arius), this
feature is étill further emphasized hy the development of yertically-disposed, hyttress-
like, aggregations of the fibres farming the inner stratum of the tunica externa of the
lateral walls of the ariterior chamber, The peculiartties of the interossieular lgument
und the inertia of the Weberian ossicles, taken in conjuuelion with other anatomical
features more directly pertaining to the slrictie of the air-bladder itself, seers ta
us to offer an insnperable objection to any theory of the funetion of those ossicles
which relies upon their capacity to be uffected by, or to transmit to the internal
