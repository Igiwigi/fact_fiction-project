Suppose now that A<A(K) and that K is boundedly reducible. Then there is a bounded
star body K’ contained in K with A(K’) = A(K). Since Ky generates K there is an automor-
phism Q of K such that QK, contains K’. Now the lattice Q@-*A has determinant

A<A(K) =A(K’),

and so there is a point other than O of QO-”A which is in K’ and which is therefore in QK,.
Thus there is a point other than O of A in the body ©’K,, for v = 0, 1,2, .... It follows just
as in the last paragraph that there are an infinity of points of A in Ky. This proves that the
conclusion (b) of theorem 4 is valid in the present case.

The conclusion (c) of theorem 4 may be established by a very similar argument, using the
fact that, if K is fully reducible, there is a bounded star body K’ contained in K such that
A(K’) = A(K) and such that every lattice, which has determinant A<A(K) and which has
no point other than O strictly inside XK’, is necessarily a critical lattice of K.

Corotiary. If d(A) <A(K), then either A has an infinity of points in the interior of K or A has
a point other than O in every core of K.

We conclude this section by applying the corollary to the body K defined by (48). As we
have seen, one core of K is given by

%,=0, [%3|<1. (52)

The only other core of K is obtained by interchanging the roles played by x, and x,, and
