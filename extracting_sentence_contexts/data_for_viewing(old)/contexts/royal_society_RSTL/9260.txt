when we remember that the ordinary contractile waves, whether originated by stimu-
Jation of the contractile tissues, or arising spontaneously from the point of attachment
of the marginal strip, usually failed to penetrate further than a quarter of the way
round. But till more astonishing is the fact that these spasmodic waves will continue
to penetrate such a spiral strip even after the latter has been s8ubmitted to a system of
interdigitating cuts of a very severe description. Here, again, of course, considerable
individual differences as to tolerance of section occur; but the drawing in Plate 30 (fig. 3)
will convey some idea of the surprising amount of tolerance that is sometimes shown.
This figure explains itself, it having been drawn to measurement from a specimen in which
the spasmodic waves, started by stimulation of any point in the seyered margin @ 6,
would penetrate the whole of the strip c d e, while in the same specimen the is
contractile waves became blocked at d. |
(ec) Now we have here to deal with a class of facts which physiologists will recognize
as of a perfectly novel character. Why it should be that the very tenuous tracts of tisswe |
which I have named should have the property of responding even to a feeble 8timulus
by issing an impulse of a kind which throws the contractile tissnes into a spasm ;
why it should be that a spasm, when 80 originated, should manifest a power of pene-
tration to which the normal contractions of the tissues in which it occurs bear 80 8mall
a proportion ; why it is that the contractile tissues should be s0 deficient in the power
of originating a spasm, even in response to the strongest stimulation applied to them-
selves—these and other questions at once suggest themselves as questions of the highest
interest: at present, however, I am wholly unable to answer them. 'To assume that
it is the ganglionic element in the margin, and possibly also in the radial tubes, which
responds to direct stimulation by discharging a peculiar impulse which has the remark-
able effect in question—to assume this is not to explain the facts, For the sake of
