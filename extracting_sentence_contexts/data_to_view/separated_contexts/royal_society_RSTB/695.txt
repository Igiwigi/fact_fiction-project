In Plate 44, fig. 28, I
represented four sporangia containing unmistakable macrospores, which I found at
the base of a Lepidostrobus, the remaining sporangia of which were filled with
microspores. Though so fragmentary as regards size, the specimen sufficed to establish
the fact that the Lepidodendron brevifolium was a heterosporous form. At a later
period Mr. CarrRuTHERS was fortunate enough to obtain a section from the same
locality, containing two superb Lepidostrobi ; these he has kindly allowed me to figure. Each of the two figures, 51 and 52, on Plate 8 is enlarged 43 diameters.
