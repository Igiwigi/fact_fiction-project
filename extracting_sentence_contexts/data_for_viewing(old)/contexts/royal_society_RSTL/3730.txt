tember 1832. It is even not improbable that the degrees of the two instruments do
not greatly differ in value, and that the lower indications in 1841 are due solely to
the greater opacity of the air, marked by the rapid decline of the curve, and (as
might be anticipated) the lower value of the limiting or final intensity.

112. On the whole, it appears from the facts and reasonings of this paper, —

1. That the absorption of the solar rays by the strata of air to which we have im-
mediate access, is considerable in amount for even moderate thicknesses.

2. That the diurnal curve of solar intensity has, even in its most normal state,
several inflections, and that its character depends materially upon the elevation of
the point of observyation.

3. That the approximations to the value of extra atmospheric solar radiation, on
the hypothesis of a geometrical diminution of intensity, are inaccurate.
