The multiplication law is not quite so simple. To offset this there are numerous
advantages. The S-functions are linearly independent, and this fact alone more than
counterbalances the possible disadvantage of the more complicated multiplication rules. Further, as we have shown, the connections between the S-functions and the products
of the functions ยง, may be read immediately from the table of characters of the
symmetric group. Lastly, the more fundamental nature of the S-functions is illustrated by the formula
connecting these with the symmetric product sums.
