#in the species of Fucus which he investigated. In Ascophyllum, the plant in which
‘4we have been best able to trace the process, it is extremely obvious that a change has
‘Boccurred. Not only the character of the spindle, but also the form of the chromo-
Bxomes, differs totally from the corresponding structures in the previous mitosis. The
‘spindle is slender and proportionally elongated, whilst the chromosomes, notwith-
‘gstanding that their small size renders it very diflicult to follow their changes of form
gin great detail, by their early longitudinal fission and their humped appearance when
‘Zon the spindle, lend support to the view that this mitosis is quite comparable with
#the peculiar heterotype division connected with the reduction phenomenon in higher
§ plants and animals.
& An interesting feature presented by the achromatic spindle in this and especially
heer in the following oogonial divisions, as well as in the divisions of the oospore, lies
in the fact that it is largely intranuclear. It begins to be formed before the nuclear
E wall can be seen to be broken down at the two ends, and this points to a mixed
9 origin for the spindle itself ; for whilst the polar radiations from the centrospheres are
certainly cytoplasmic, it seems highly probable that a part, at any rate, of the inter-
polar part of the structure is of nuclear origin. Later on the nuclear wali breaks
down or thins out at the poles, although the lateral walls still sharply delimit the
nuclear space from the surrounding cytoplasm. The polar radiations from the ends
of the spindle for the most part end in the protoplasmic substance of the oogonium,
and do not reach to the outer limit of the cell. Some importance has heen attached
