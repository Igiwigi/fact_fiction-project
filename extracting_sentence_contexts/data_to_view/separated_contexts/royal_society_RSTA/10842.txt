The tarnishing, however,
was not very rapid, and a specimen could safely be heated up to bright red once before
it became noticeable. This enabled us to make observations which very clearly showed
that, even with the greatest experimental refinement, we could not hope to observe
the process of re-crystallisation microscopically. We have found that if a strained,
polished and etched specimen, showing distinctly elongated crystals, be gradually
heated in vacuo no change whatever is visible in the outlines of the crystals; on
removing the specimen from the apparatus it is sometimes found coated with a thin
blue tarnish, and on examination with the microscope it is seen that this tarnish has
not obliterated the original crystals, but in fact differentiates them by various
colours on different crystals, If this tarnish be now polished off, as may easily be
done by the use of rouge alone, and the specimen be re-etched, an entirely new set
of crystals is revealed, This was readily established by drawing the outlines of the
original crystals at a marked spot on the specimen before and after the light
re-polishing. Simple re-polishing and etching a similar specimen, without annealing,
produces only very small changes in the pattern. We may therefore conclude that
in the above experiment the iron did re-crystallise when at a red heat, but that this
re-crystallisation did not immediately affect the pattern on the surface.
