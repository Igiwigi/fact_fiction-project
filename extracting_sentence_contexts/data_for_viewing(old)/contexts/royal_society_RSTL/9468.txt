Sr do not attribute mnch weight to the last two 8eries, for I fancy the computed positions of 4 and & are
St divergent from your observed positions. The calculation puts these lines 1 degree of wave frequency
Rale (=1-4 degree of AXG8rRO's scale) nearer together than your determination.”
-SMr. Lookyss, in a © Note on the Spectrum of Hydrogen ” (Proceedings Royal Society, December 17,
-S9), degcribes a line in his photographs of hydrogen coincident with H in the solar spectrum.
r= many of my own photographs this line and also ,ſine lines coincident with most of the typical lines

© [Mezsrs. Dewar and Liyzixc state that the calcium line K is more easily reversed than the calcium line
© H (Proceedings Royal Society, February 20, 1879). This fact should be considered in connexion
'* ith the presence of a line of bydrogen at H in any explanation that may be attempted of the phenomena

* Professors Dewar and Livzno have permitted me to witness some of their experiments in which

8 ns changes of relative intensity of K to H occur in the emis8ion spectrum of calcium. They are
opinion that these variations and similar changes in the absorption spectrum, such as those shown in
Stars, naturally follow from the known laws of emission and absorption. They state that the line of

m K is more easily reversed than the line at the position of H.
