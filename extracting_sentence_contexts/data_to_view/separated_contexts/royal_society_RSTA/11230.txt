For 4677 mares—my complete series without mares with alternative
¢ sires—the average fecundity was ‘6373. A better agreement could not have been
Bhoped for. In a group of 1509 mares dealt with for variation only and entered as
3 “ daughters” on the cards—so that they had not been selected by the fact that their

daughters must have recorded offspring, as is the case with “dam” entries—I found
& the following results :—

Vanrration in Fecundity of 1509 Brood-mares (Four Coverings).
