When one is considering taking-off, which is a dramatic change in individual behaviour, it is
natural to think in terms of reactions, but the mass departure depends, as far as the indi-
vidual is concerned, on the mere continuation, in place of the previously repeated cessation,
of an activity, flight, which was already in train, and which is destined sometimes to con-
tinue for many hours. This does not suggest a reaction at all. The idea of a reaction would not have arisen, it appears, were it not for the fact that mass
departure starts, as arule, rather suddenly, as the only obvious break in the morning sequence
of movement-patterns. The main object of Gunn et al. was not to make a causal analysis
of the process by which a swarm becomes finally launched on migration, but rather to find
what governed the timing of this process. They considered the density of the locusts as likely
to govern the intensity of gregarious excitation, and in that sense as a factor comparable
with other regulating factors which vary from time to time and place to place, like tempera-
ture humidity, wind, etc.
