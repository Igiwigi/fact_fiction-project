The lowest level is always
a component of the triplet of smallest L—value, followed by the triplet of highest L,
the remaining triplets following more or less in order of the magnitude of L.

3d%4s*—From a knowledge of the ion difference d* 2D — d*s*F, the position of
3d*452 °F can be estimated as about 50,000 wave-numbers above 3d%4s._— This
unfortunately places it on top of the levels 3d°4p with which it should make strong
combinations. The corresponding 'D *P 'G 1S should be sufficiently higher to give
lines in the visible. This is the case ; and, in fact, one of these levels was found and
the remainder could have been found from spark and arc observations, because the
combinations d°4p — d*s? are all sharp lines. The discovery of d%s??F was only
possible after the d°5p levels had been found, with which it combines with moderate
intensity. d8s? 1S) has not been found in this or any other spectrum.

3d°4s4p and Perturbations—The levels of this structure should combine with d°4s and
d’4s?, but not with d%5s because the latter transition corresponds to a double electron
change. The structure gives no less than 90 levels, of which 68 have been found.
