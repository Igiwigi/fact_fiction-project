Note on the Construction of the Models. By Pror. Souuas.

Plaster models such as we have used in this study have many advantages over wax ones ; they are more
enduring, and can be readily reproduced. To obtain a plaster model is, however, by no means an easy
problem ; the obvious solution would seem to be to cast from a wax one, but if the latter be at all
complicated, this is a task which even an expert will not undertake. The only way is to build up the
plaster model in successive sheets, a method which is rendered possible by the fact that plaster cast upon
freshly-set plaster will adhere to it. The steps in the process are as follows :—Tracings of the photographed
sections are first made on transparent paper, and round each a rectangle is drawn to provide for exact
registration. Sheets of wax are prepared of uniform thickness ; placing one of these over a tracing the
outline of the section is cut out with a fine pointed scalpel and the sides of the sheet are cut to correspond
with the surrounding rectangle. When all the sections have been thus treated, the rectangular sheets of
wax are superposed in order and the model, which exists now as a cavity in the wax, is examined to see
if the registration is true. If this is found to be the case we may next proceed to reconstruct by casting.
The first sheet in the series is attached to a plain sheet of wax which serves as base, plaster is then poured
into the hollow of the section and allowed to set ; directly afterwards the sheet with its contained plaster
is placed in a specially constructed machine by which both sheet and plaster can be planed down to a
definite thickness. The sheet is then removed from the machine and the next sheet in the series is
registered upon it and attached, plaster is poured into the hollow, and wherever this rests on the plaster
