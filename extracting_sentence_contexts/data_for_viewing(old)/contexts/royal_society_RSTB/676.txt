It is evident that in all the above cases the action of the chloroform vapour was
to cause diminution of negativity or increase of positivity of the muscular substance,
i.e,, the same effect as that produced upon the outer surface of the Eelâ€™s skin.

Excrration.

In the above pages, the experiments quoted have dealt solely with depressions of
the value of the E.M.F., generated at the outer surface of the skin. It is now neces-
sary to turn to the question whether it may not be possible to obtain increments of
E.M.F. as a result of excitation.

Excitatory electrical variations in glandular structures have long been known.
VALENTIN (19), in 1861, and Rorper (20), in 1869, demonstrated the fact for the
skin of the Frog. Hermann and Lucusiycer (21), in 1878, did the same in the case
of the tongue glands of the Frog and the sweat glands of the paw of the Cat, Lucu-
SINGER (22), in 1880, in the glands of the snout of the Pig, Goat, and Cat, and
Bayxiss and Braprorp (16), in 1887, in the salivary glands of the Cat and Dog.

The case of the skin of the Frog has been more frequently examined than the others,
but the results have proved most conflicting at the hands of the several observers
