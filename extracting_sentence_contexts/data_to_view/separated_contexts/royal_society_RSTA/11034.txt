In consequence, perhaps, of its extreme viscosity and the
relatively small amount of water present, a 50-per cent. solution of sodium hydroxide
has far less action on glass than a dilute solution. Its density did not alter by a
single unit in the fourth place when stored during ten weeks in a glass bottle. A
further advantage in the use of concentrated solutions is found in the fact that the
carbonate is almost insoluble, and, if produced by exposure to air, separates as a
precipitate at the bottom of the bottle, producing a small change in the concentration
of the solution, but hardly any depreciation of its purity. CONDUCTIVITY OF SODIUM HYDROXIDE IN AQUEOUS SOLUTION. 265

Soprum HyproxipE at 18° ©. Determinations of the density of aqueous solutions of sodium hydroxide have been
made by some six different investigators, but owing to the difficulty of preparing pure
solutions of known concentration, the results obtained have not been characterised by
any close approach to accuracy, and the published tables are far less trustworthy
than those for a substance like common salt, which can be weighed out in an
anhydrous condition, or sulphuric acid, which can be purified by distillation and
freezing.
