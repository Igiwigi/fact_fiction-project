Figure 8b demonstrates the floating test showing the floating ability of the coated sample. The
uncoated sample quickly sank in water and the coated sample continued to float on the water
surface.

(b) Droplet dynamics tests

When a water droplet impacts a coated surface with different velocities, three different types
of droplet behaviour (bouncing, pinning and splashing) are observed, as shown in figure 9.
These behaviours were characterized with Re number and We number, as mentioned in equations
(2.1) and (2.2). Table 3 summarizes the We and Re numbers of bouncing, pinning and splashing
behaviour with respect to impact velocities. At a low impact velocity of 0.44ms~! (We =27.24
and Re = 1328), the droplet shows bouncing behaviour. The water droplet bounces back with little
deformation in its shape. This may be due to the fact that the kinetic energy of the water droplet
is less than the surface energy of water. Pinning is observed when the water droplet impacts at a
