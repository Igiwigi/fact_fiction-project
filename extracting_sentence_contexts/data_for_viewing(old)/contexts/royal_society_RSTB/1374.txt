mains, with some obstinacy, amorphous. After purification the crystals become
acteristic enough, taking the forms proper to pure uric acid, and not those of
ne sediments. The commonest forms are rhombic prisms with truncated angles,
d these tend to form rosettes. In solutions of intermediate purity the crystals may
tiefly comprise rosettes of fine needles, but approximations to the whetstone form of
rine sediments are not uncommon.
Although the contents of the white scales are to all appearance amorphous, I am
nclined to think that the acid exists in them mainly uncombined, and not as urates.
f it be combined with a base it is certainly in a form analogous to the quadrurates,
because, although the amorphous tendencies of the extracted substance as described
we always in evidence, it is quite certain that characteristic crystals of the free acid
ay eventually be obtained in aqueous extracts of the wings without any acid being
dded. Such extracts are, in fact, markedly acid themselves while hot. I have not
et had a supply of material large enough to spare any for the proper investigation of
ssibly combined bases, but the point is of no great importance at present. The
stological relationship of the uric acid to the scale is exactly that of the yellow
pigment found in allied insects, or existing in other scales on the same wing, that is
to say, it is found as a deposit between the chitinous layers of which the scale is
nade up.

Ill. The Yellow Pigment.

Tt will be shown later that the same substance functions throughout the group
herever yellow or orange appears in the colourings of any species. But the pigment
of the common English Brimstone Butterfly (Gonepterya rhamni) is here dealt with as
