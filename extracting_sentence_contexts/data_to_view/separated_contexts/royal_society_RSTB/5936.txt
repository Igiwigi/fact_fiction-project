Material.—A specimen of this species (E.196) from Saul (Meurthe et Moselle) invited
excavation on account of the softness of its infilling; and, although the peristomial
region was somewhat broken, a sufficient expanse of the girdle was found to be intact. The approximate dimensions of the test are—diameter 45 mm, height 29 mm. SOME RECENT AND FOSSIL ECHINOIDEA 629

Deseription.—The processes rise directly from the peristomial margin, and are, in
fact, based on promontories of the ambulacra which project into the peristomial circle
beyond its average circumference. The shafts are stout at their roots, and almost
carinate along the sides of the arch. They are very slightly splayed outwards, but
almost vertical.
