ma’s role in specifying the form of the embryo could be
regarded as supplying the information necessary for embry-
ogenesis, in exactly the same way that paternal and
maternal DNA together specify the offspring’s phenotype.
While we need to beware of anachronism (although Aristotle
was interested in human genetics, his understanding of
inheritance was at that time necessarily very limited), this is
a timely reminder that teleology (in the sense of the specifica-
tion of a developmental outcome before it has begun) has not
completely disappeared from our current set of ideas about
developmental biology.

Unfortunately for Aristotle’s theory, there is in fact no
connection at all between fertilization and the incidence of
complete metamorphosis. It is indeed true that some insect
eggs are able to develop without fertilization (see above),
but Aristotle is unlikely to have encountered this. Given
that he equated fertilization with mating, Aristotle’s error is
surprising. In Generation of animals the philosopher states
clearly that although he has observed insects mating, he
does not believe that this activity is what it appears to be,
because he does not believe that this act results in fertiliza-
tion. As a result, in some cases he simply denies that

Aristotle’s error concerning fertilization is important, because
