3 It will be seen that the observations of the torsional rigidity vary very little from a mean
‘gvalue of 5-110 x 104, and in fact the highest value of the rigidity occurred in test E, in which
sthe beam was most plastic. The standard error of each observation of the torsional rigidity
Awas estimated from the data as 0-016 x 10*. The standard error of the difference between
‘zany avo of the torsional rigidities was therefore 0-016 x 10*,/2, or 0-022 x 10*. The greatest
‘flifference occurring was 0-041 x 10* between tests C and E, and a test of significance showed
Sthat the probability of this difference being due to errors of random sampling was about
i ‘5%. This probability is low, but cannot be judged significant.
Z Each observation of the torsional rigidity may therefore be expected to be the same, and
gtheir degree of scatter about their general mean, 5-110 x 104, may be examined to form
‘ga separate estimate of their standard error. In this way, the standard error may be estimated
Sas 0-019 x 104, and this value does not differ significantly from the previous value 0-016 x 104.
'SThus the only cause of variance of the observations was that associated with the process of
Sestimating the slopes of the straight lines fitted to the observations of load and deflexion. The
