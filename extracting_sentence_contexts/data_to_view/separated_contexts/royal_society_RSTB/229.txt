Some of these movements we
have already discussed in considering the mode of the march (p. 237), but to these
considerations we would like to add one or two more of a wider nature. It is time’
to consider whether we cannot elucidate the fundamental principles which underlie
the development of the mechanism for the performance of so-called voluntary actions. In the first place, we cannot pass by the obvious fact upon which we think we are
now entitled to speak with some degree of certainty, viz., the suggestive difference
between the functional activity of the ascending frontal and ascending parietal
portions of the upper limb area. While at the upper part (especially anteriorly) of the ascending frontal portion we
find represented, as an initial movement, advancing of the whole limb with extension

of all the joints, behind the fissure of Rouanno the converse exists, and accordingly we
find there the function of adduction and retraction of the shoulder with flexion of the
elbow. Summing all these facts together, we would advance the suggestion that an exact
parallelism exists between the topographical relations just described and the sequence
of movements in such a very frequent purposive action as that of, first, directing the
gaze upon an object ; next, reaching forward of the upper limb with extension of the
joints to seize it; and, thirdly, the withdrawing of the arm with adduction of the
shoulder, and carrying of the hand to the mouth by flexion of the elbow.

& We are loath to lay too much stress on these deductions, as they are necessarily
Fépeculative, and also because we feel that a great deal has yet to be done in explana-
dion of the fact that there are several movements relatively frequently performed

sby the head and eyes or the limbs, and yet which we have not been able to elicit by
Slectrical stimulation from the regions in which they are presumably represented.
