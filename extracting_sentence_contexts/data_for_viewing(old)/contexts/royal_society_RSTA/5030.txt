of the instability in three and two dimensions may be very different. The three-dimensional
configurations are more prone to secondary instabilities and to the development of the fully
turbulent state in which the initial instabilities may not be dominant or even important.

(d) Turbulent reconnection and plasma effects

A substantial part of the reconnection research is based on exploring plasma physics effects on
reconnection (see [16,185] for reviews). LV99 shows that reconnection rates should not depend
on plasma microphysics in the presence of turbulence. This conclusion was supported by a

numerical study [33], where plasma effects were simulated by introducing anomalous resistivity.
The subdominance of reconnection arising from the Hall effect to that arising due to turbulence
was shown analytically in ELV11. A more rigorous comparison of the turbulence induced
reconnection with that induced by other terms in the generalized Ohm equation was provided
in [35], where it was shown that for typical astrophysical parameters turbulence effects are
absolutely dominant.

Nevertheless, the studies that show that magnetic reconnection can be fast in the absence of
turbulence (see [16] for a review and references therein) pose interesting questions on the actual
role of turbulence. There are, for instance, suggestions that tearing of the current sheet may make
