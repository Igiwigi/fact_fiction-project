Data science, as the latest phase of the information revolution, is now prompting a further
change in the LoA at which our ethical analysis can be developed most fruitfully. In a few
decades, we have come to understand that it is not a specific technology (computers, tablets,
mobile phones, online platforms, cloud computing and so forth), but what any digital technology
manipulates that represents the correct focus of our ethical strategies. The shift from information
ethics to data ethics is probably more semantic than conceptual, but it does highlight the need to
concentrate on what is being handled as the true invariant of our concerns. This is why labels
such as ‘robo-ethics’ or ‘machine ethics’ miss the point, anachronistically stepping back to a time
when ‘computer ethics’ seemed to provide the right perspective. It is not the hardware that causes :
ethical problems, it is what the hardware does with the software and the data that represents the [=
source of our new difficulties. LoAp brings into focus the different moral dimensions of data. 23
In doing so, it highlights the fact that, before concerning information, ethical problems such
as privacy, anonymity, transparency, trust and responsibility concern data collection, curation, mea)
analysis and use, and hence they are better understood at that level. :

In the light of this change of LoA, data ethics can be defined as the branch of ethics a]
that studies and evaluates moral problems related to data (including generation, recording, DNS
curation, processing, dissemination, sharing and use), algorithms (including artificial intelligence, aon
artificial agents, machine learning and robots) and corresponding practices (including responsible De
innovation, programming, hacking and professional codes), in order to formulate and support .
morally good solutions (e.g. right conducts or right values). This means that the ethical challenges
posed by data science can be mapped within the conceptual space delineated by three axes of
research: the ethics of data, the ethics of algorithms and the ethics of practices.
