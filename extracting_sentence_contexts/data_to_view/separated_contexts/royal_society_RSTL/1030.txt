I ought to add, that though the bullets are of
the common size, and are consequently considerably less in
diameter than the bore, means are used which effectually pre- $
vent the loss of force by windage; and to this last circumstance
it is doubtless owing, in a great measure, that the charge ap-
pears to exert 80 great a force in propelling the bullets. That the conical form of the lower part of the bore, where
it unites with 'the chamber, has a considerable share in pro-
ducing this extraordinary effect, is however very certain, as I

have found by experiments made with a view merely to ascer-
tain that fact. I will finish this paper by a computation, which will show
that the force of the elastic fluid generated in the combustion
of gunpowder, enormous as it is, may. be satisfactorily ac-
counted for upon the supposition that its force depends solely
on the elasticity of watery vapour, or steam.
