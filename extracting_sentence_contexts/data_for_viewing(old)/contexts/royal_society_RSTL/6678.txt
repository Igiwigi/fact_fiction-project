same at both stations, = 12-9 in British units; then, having the Dip at Point Barrow
81* 36', and' at Port Kennedy 88? 27', we have the terrestrial horizontal force 1:88 at
Point Barrow, and 0-35 at Port Kennedy. Whence we find that, on the hypothesis of
there being an equal energy of the disturbing force at the two stations, the disturbance-
value corresponding to 22':87 at Point Barrow should have been 123' at Port Kennedy
instead of 70'. Whilst, therefore, there is an increase in the effect of the disturbing
action at Port Kennedy by reason of the diminution of the antagonistic horizontal
terrestrial force, there is obyiously also evidence of an actual and yery considerable
8uperiority in the energy of the disturbing force itself at Point Barrow as compared
with Port Kennedy.

The inference which we thus derive from the direct comparison of the disturbances at
Port Kennedy and Point Barrow is in accordance with the fact preyiously made known
