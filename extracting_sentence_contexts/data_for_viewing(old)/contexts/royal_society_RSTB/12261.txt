Kiwi BBPB 65 25 36 14 (a) Is animal communication compositional?
kiwi BB P PY 28.3 5.0 67 12 Are humans unique in having the capacity to compose com-
apple PYBBPY 20.0 12.0 27 16 plex expressions from simpler ones? Schlenker et al. [32] have
kiwi PP PYP 79.0 18.8 52 12 proposed to distinguish between limited (trivial) and genuine
a (non-trivial) compositionality. Examples in English are
kiwi PYP PP 208 18 126 i ‘It’s humid’ (trivial) and ‘It’s very humid’ (non-trivial). The
kiwi P PY PY P 13 25 15 29 difference lies in the fact that for trivial compositions, there is
kiwi PPPYY 16.5 65 3.5 14 no need for semantic operations; separate utterances are
apple PYPPYPY 148 33 55 12 merely added into meaningful expressions. In genuine compo-
sitions, a semantic operation is active, such that the composite
apple PY PY P 0.0 158 10 >12 expression cannot be analysed from its components (‘it’s
apple YPYPY 9.3 2.0 57 12 humid’, ‘very’) in a direct way. In several theory papers,
apple PY PY Y PY 58 20.8 13 46 primate call systems have been analysed in such ways, which
apple YPYY 65 143 15 32 has led to the conclusion that some systems, particularly
Campbell’s monkey call suffixation and putty-nosed monkey
