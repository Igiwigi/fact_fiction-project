and advice on the dental aspects of the problem. One of the principal objects of the
investigation was to determine the position of the centre of rotation of a tooth under
the action of a force applied to the crown. This question, which has interested research
workers in dentistry, is answered in §§$11 and 14 in respect of certain model teeth
having membranes of constant thickness (a simplification unfortunately rendered
necessary for mathematical reasons).

But perhaps a more important deduction in the present paper (involved qualitatively
in the basic hypothesis of incompressibility) is the considerable local variation in pressure
in the membrane when the tooth is subjected to the forces arising in occlusion. This
has not, I think, been taken into consideration previously. 1 am not competent to
discuss the physiological consequences of such local variations in pressure, and shall
merely emphasise the fact that the application of a force of considerably less than
one pound weight may reduce the pressure to zero at some points in the membrane,
while raising it to two atmospheres at other points. In deducing numerical results
in this connection, the only data required are geometrical measurements of teeth ;
the rigidity drops out of the equations, as also does the thickness of the membrane.
The weakest point in the argument is the assumption of uniform thickness of the
membrane, but we can at least hope to have obtained results of a rough quantitative
significance.

Throughout the paper, the argument is kept as general as possible, and numerical
values are only inserted in order to obtain final numerical results. While the arguments
of Part I are very general, and would apply (as far as they go) to a multiple-rooted
