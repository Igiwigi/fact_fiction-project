From this it follows, first, that s = 1, whence g,(«) =0 mod (pS),,. Thus the 8/p-modules
o/s: and G/(pG),, have the same rank, viz. the degree of g,(x) ; in other words, (pS), = q-

" (This fact is also a direct consequence of (6.2).) Secondly, it follows that gi(«) 40 mod a3
_ so S/q,, being obtained by adjunction ofa separable element to R/p, is a separable extension
