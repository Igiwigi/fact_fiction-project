Koch et al. [8] discuss
the evolution of such plants that inhabit desert regions and how they have evolved structural and
functional relationships that can inspire future smart surfaces, which is the aim of this particular
research (i.e. to inform the design of a future biomimetic water-harvesting device). Other studies have focused on fog water; that is, Ju et al. [9] observed fog droplets being
directed even against gravity from the tips of Opuntia microdasys to their bases and Cao et al. [10]
also noted the directional movement of fog water on the conical spines of cacti. In fact,
biomimetic-inspired microstructured surfaces have been found to enhance surface transportation
of water [11]. Unlike such studies that have focused on fog water harvesting on cactus spines, the
spines of cacti have also been found to be an important feature in increasing the amount of dew
harvested by certain cactus species [7]. Thus, the spines were the main points of interest in this
study with the aim of informing a future airborne harvesting device.
