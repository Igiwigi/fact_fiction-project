cervical groove in the former and of the sinus in the latter and which is now generally
known as the ductus branchialis. Hammar has shown that it represents the closed-
off second ectodermal groove and there can be no doubt but that in Trichosurus it has
a similar origin. We regard it as being formed by the closing off and separation from
the ectoderm of that part of the second ectodermal groove which in Stage IV is

involved in the formation of the closing membrane, supplemented by the closing-off of
the dorso-cranial corner of the sinus which is occupied by the direct downward
continuation of the ectodermal groove. That mode of origin is in agreement with the
fact that the ectobranchial duct is connected with the ectoderm only at its lower end
where it passes into continuity with the sinus-wall, whilst the narrow lumen which is
present in the ventral half of its extent appears as the direct upward continuation of
the persisting sinus-portion of the ectodermal groove. The line of fusion of the ecto-
and ento-branchial ducts is of the nature of an oblique overlap and includes the
region of the closing membrane, but the latter is no longer distinguishable as a distinct
structure, with the result that it is impossible to determine the exact limits of the
ectoderm and entoderm. The evidence indicates, however, that, as in the preceding
stages, the pouch-entoderm is continued asa solid process fused with the ectobranchial
duct right down to the sinus.

For the very short composite segment which thus intervenes between the second
pouch and the sinus-ectoderm, we adopt the designation suggested by Hammar (22)
