In the former again the recovery became well developed, allowing the animals
to use the limbs in walking, in one case at 45 and in the other at 90 days, while in
the latter no such progress was made so early, but a similar progress was not shown
till later, namely, from about 79 days to 126 days. Thus it is apparent that the
effect of cutting out the central representation of one group of muscles is to increase
the length of time required for a recovery to a very marked degree. As far as can
be ascertained the two sets of experiments corresponded in all other details, so that
the conclusion is inevitable that it is the fact of causing the one central representation
to do the work of two, instead of causing the two central representations merely to
exchange functions that causes the delay in restoration of function of the muscle
groups affected. This increase of time necessary for recovery is due apparently to
the reduction of volume of the nerve supply, and possibly also to the fact that the
central representation must needs take on a double function, which may involve a
more complex change than a mere alteration of function of the entire centre. (b) Comparison with the Experiments on Nerve Crossing published by Others.—
