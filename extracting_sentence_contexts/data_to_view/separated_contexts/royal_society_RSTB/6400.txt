The spores
ranged in size from 25 p-37-+5 Â», had clear yellow walls, and in some cases showed
the tri-radiate marking, though in many it was not evident. Fig. 13, Plate 8,
shows a number of the spores lying against the black fragments of the sporangial
wall. Observations which corroborate and extend the facts ascertained from the
three specimens described above were made on other preparations from Perton
Quarry. Thus as regards size an axis about } mm. or less in width, bearing a
sporangium 1}-2 mm. across by 1 mm. in height, may be taken as usual dimensions
for the distal portions of the plant. More slender axes bearing smaller sporangia
have been seen.
