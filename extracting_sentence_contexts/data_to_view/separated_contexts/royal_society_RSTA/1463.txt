These and other methods are perfectly well described : =
by assuming a nonlinear, or ‘multi-linear’ (meaning multiple patterns influence the emission in : =
a linear way) dependence of the detected light on the local excitation intensity. All involved 13
quantities such as local concentration and local excitation and emission intensity can conceptually : =
all be continuous quantities and do not require the assumption of state switching in the model DR
describing the image formation. The fact that the sample does indeed consist of molecules that : re
each are in well-defined states at any moment in time is currently more of a problem to these 1
‘continuous’ methods than a gain. In NL-SIM and RESOLFT, the switching statistics causes 8
unwanted super-Poissonian noise, meaning that multiple photons are typically detected from the : 3

a

same state of the molecule. Research towards exploiting the single-molecular discrete switching
nature has begun with methods such as MINFLUX, ROSE, ModLoc, SIMPLE and SIMFLUX
[22,23], but will doubtlessly continue towards nonlinear SIM or STED approaches.
