With regard to the relation between the maxillary glands and the antennal glands,
it can be safely stated that these two glands are usually taken as being homologous
structures. There are certain points, however, that indicate that possibly this is not
so, or, at least, that indicate that while the end sacs of both glands may be the remains
of coelomic cavities, the ducts may be of different origin, and hence not homologous.
Until the development of the antennal gland has been fully worked out, it is not possible
to settle this point with any degree of certainty.

From a recent comparative account of the excretory glands of Crustacea (4) it appears
that they can be divided into two groups, according to the nature of their efferent ducts.
In the one group the duct is intracellular and consists of three, or at least very few,
cells, while in the other it is intercellular and is composed of a large number of cells
and may be a very complex structure. This fact, in itself, appears to the author sufficient
to render it highly improbable that the excretory glands are homologous throughout
the group.

Tn the earliest nauplius of Estheria the antennal glands are not fully formed, their
ducts being still in a rudimentary condition. A comparison of the duct rudiments at
this stage with certain ectodermal glands suggests that the duct portions of the glands
are really ectodermal in origin, and hence not homologous with the duct portions of the
maxillary glands.

Immediately after hatching, the antennal gland consists of a small end sac joined
to the ectoderm by a duct system of three cells (a, text-fig. 5). â€˜The end sac is a thin-
walled sac, and the general view will be adopted here that it is a ccelomic sac. The
