Statistically, interpretation of this is as a system whose model provides a con-

maximizing model evidence is equivalent to maximizing text-free prediction that the sensed quantity is at its set point. The


loop from sensed quantity to sensory neuron to motor neuron to
sensed quantity could then be seen as a feedback loop. The impli-
cation is that the 2-neuron reflex is in fact the simplest form of
predictive control. Why is this a useful perspective? First, it
answers the objection outlined above.
