The aggregate corresponding to the minimum value of (ACD) will evidently give
minimum values to the partial associations in positive universes like |AC|D|, but
maximum values to those in negative universes |AC|8!, AD|y|, &. Then inspection
will show that only for |AC|D| and |AD|C| are the limits + 1; for the remaining

associations the limits are—

In the discussion of the Childhood Society’s material in my previous memoir I
remarked on the fact that all the partial coefficients of association between defects
in positive universes were small, while those in negative universes were large and
positive. I at first thought that this might be a logical consequence of the given
values of the second-order groups, but this is not the case. The values of the
associations like |AC|D|, |AD|C|, &c., are almost indeterminate; certain of the
coefficients with negative universes (|AC|8|, |AD|y|) are necessarily positive, but
others (|CD|a]|) may fall to the extreme limit —
