'=Here is a piece of work loudly calling for accomplishment, and one on which any young

Sgeologist may base an honourable reputation. = Mr. Hoyx1xs, I believe, was the first to urge the existence of roches polices at the ends

of existing glaciers and along the continuations of existing glacier valleys as an evidence
jn support of the sliding theory. That such facts exist is known to every body, and that

Sthe rocks are thus polished and rounded by the glaciers sliding over them is incontro-

Syertible. Let a traveller, if he wish to obtain a wealth of information upon this subject. Etransport himself to the terminus of the Unteraar glacier, and walk thence down the

Evalley through which the river Aar now flows.
