his also is not harmful in small quantities, but its presence shews that the original
‘powder has contained mercuric sulphate. This has been resolved by the water with
“ghe formation of the yellow substance and a soluble acid mercuric sulphate, and
giles this process is complete and all traces of the original mercuric salt have been
Gemoved, error will be introduced.* Thus good cells may be set up with paste which
% yellow at starting, provided the change is complete, but if the paste of a cell turns
Sellow after the cell has been made, it means that the mercuric salt is present, and
Bhis affects the E.M.F. On treating a sample containing mercuric sulphate with
Mercury, the mercuric sulphate is converted into mercurous, and may be used
“‘Bvith safety.

‘8 The fact that the mercury mixes shows, as Mr. Swrnpurye has remarked, that the
Sulphate is bad, but the result of the mixing is that the evil is cured. This, then, is
‘She rationale of the method of preparing the paste given in the memorandum. The
4vashing with water resolves most, if not all, of the mercuric salt present into the
Bellow basic sulphate 3HgO.SO,, and the soluble sulphate HgSO,.2S0,; the latter is
“Jlissolved and removed. The shaking with mercury at a temperature near 30° removes
Hiny further traces of the acid mercuric salt. The temperature should not exceed 30°,
dor, when cooling from a temperature in excess of this, crystals may form which are
Brot of the proper composition ZnSO,.7H,0.
