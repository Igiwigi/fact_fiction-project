hidden variables whatsoever behind quantum mechanics (QM). If this is taken as an accepted
fact, then what are the consequences for quantum theory?

To answer this question, we will follow the route opened in [9,10], by first forgetting
the quantum formalism, and restarting from physical considerations. This approach will be
illustrated by various examples, until we meet again the mathematical description.

2. Contexts, systems, modalities

As a first step, we will consider a minimal set of hypotheses, corresponding to a simple version
of the Kochen-Specker theorem [11], and which taken together lead to a contradiction. By
examining which of these hypotheses might be given up, and how, we will get a new set of
hypotheses, escaping the previous contradiction by using ‘extracontextuality’, a concept already
introduced in [10]. We will show that this new set of hypotheses is consistent with quantum
