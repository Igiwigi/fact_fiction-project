The starting point for proving the regularity of the free boundary of the optimal set relies on the :
analysis of the state function, solution of the PDE Da

—Au=f in®, ue H\(Q). 3

The case of a general spectral functional (1.2) involving higher eigenvalues leads to a new kind : 8
of difficulties related to the fact that each eigenvalue of order higher than 1 is itself a saddle point axes)
and not a minimizer of an unconstrained energy! This fact makes very difficult any attempt to
use the Alt-Caffarelli techniques in a direct manner. For example, the natural choice of a state
function in the 4, optimization problem (1.3) is a corresponding eigenfunction, solution of

— Au = Aj(2)uUR in 2, uz € H}(Q), | ugdx=1.

Even in this simple case, the relationship between the set 2 and the eigenfunction u, is not trivial,
2 being, in general, only a set containing {1 4 0} (in fact, if 2 is just a quasi-open set, it is not
even known if the nodal line {1 =0}/M @ has a zero Lebesgue measure). The knowledge of ux
alone gives the value of the eigenvalue but not its actual position in the spectrum and does not
characterize the set 2. To obtain this information, one also needs to understand the behaviour of
the first k — 1 eigenfunctions, even tough they do not appear explicitly in problem (1.3).
