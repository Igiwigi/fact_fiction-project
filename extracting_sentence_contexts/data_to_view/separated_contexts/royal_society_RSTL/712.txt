Experiment on Camphor with sutphuric Acid. The effects produced -on camphor by sulphuric acid have
been but very superficially examined ; for all that has hitherto
been-stated amounts to this, that camphor is dissolved by sul-
phuric acid, that a brown-or reddish-brown solution-is formed,


on a Substance possessing the Properties of Tannin. gog

and that the camphor is precipitated unchanged from this solu-
tion by water. These facts, however, only relate to a certain
period of the operation, for if this be long continued, other

effects are produced, which I shall now describe. A. To one hundred grains of pure camphor put into a small
glass alembic, one ounce of concentrated sulphuric acid was

added. - The camphor immediately became yellow, and gra-
dually diss0lved, during which, the acid progressively changed

to. brownish-red, and afterwards to brown.
