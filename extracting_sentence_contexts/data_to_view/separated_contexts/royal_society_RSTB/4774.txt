A. FISHER ON THE INFLUENCE OF RAINFALL

the actual regressions and the correlations which are, in a complicated manner, com-
pounded from them ; and even slight meteorological correlations might seriously disturb
the numerical values of the correlations with the crop; but our meteorological data
show that such correlations between weather at different periods of the year, though
probably present, are quite small; and since the agreement, in its general qualitative
outline, has not been disturbed from January onwards, it is probable that other factors
contribute to the striking difference observable in the effects of October rain. In
particular it may be noted that Hooxkur’s values at this period, allowing for the fact that
adjacent points are not independent, but have four identical weeks in common, show
somewhat abrupt changes ; the values found for November-December agree well with
our maximum in October, and the damage ascribed by Hooker to “ seed-time ”? may
be paralleled by the somewhat increased damage shown in many of our curves in
September. In this connection an investigation is desirable of the accuracy with which
Hooxer’s process of correlating with sets of 8-consecutive weeks, is able to indicate
the true maxima or minima of the correlation curve ; and to what errors such estimates
are exposed owing to the capricious incidence of heavy rain. A consideration which more probably contains a solution of the discrepancy is that
under industrial farming conditions rain in late autumn and early winter prevents the
sowing of large areas of wheat, the land being sown in spring with oats or barley.
