in 1893, the year of largest sunspot frequency, and least in 1890 and 1900, the years
of least sunspot frequency.. As will be seen presently, the inequality range and the
sunspot frequency show a very close parallelism in their variation. The changes in
the type of the inequality from year to year are small, and their elucidation requires
a more sensitive method, such as the analysis into Fourier waves presently discussed.
A tendency can, however, be recognised for the hour of the forenoon minimum to be
slightly earlier when sunspots are few than when they are numerous.

ยง8. The V inequality data for the 12 months in Table IX. are shown graphically
in fig. 8, while fig. 4 contrasts the diurnal inequalities for the seasons and the year
derived from the whole eleven years and from the sunspot maximum and minimum
groups of years, as given in Tables [X., X., and XI. The V inequality data are not
quite so smooth as those for H, especially in winter. The fact that the H curves
were smoothed, while the V curves were not, presumably partly accounts for this.
The variation in the type of the inequality throughout the year is less in V than in
H. In some months two distinct maxima and minima are visible in V, but the
principal maximum always occurs in the afternoon between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m., while
the principal minimum, in the forenoon, is as uniform in its time of incidence as the
corresponding minimum in H. The time intervening between the morning minimum

and afternoon maximum is less for V than for H, and, speaking generally, the
preponderance in changes by day over those by night is greater in V. A further
