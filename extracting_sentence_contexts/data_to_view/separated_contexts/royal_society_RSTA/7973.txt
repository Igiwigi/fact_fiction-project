As we pass over the surface of
the root, the pressure undergoes finite variations and these variations yield a finite
resultant, capable of balancing finite applied forces. We find, in the course of the
investigation, that the displacement of the tooth, as a result of the application of finite
forces, is very small indeed, varying as the cube of the thickness of the membrane. This fact gives additional weight to the present theory, as explaining the tightness of
the teeth, for, if the membrane were a compressible elastic body. we would find the
displacement of the tooth directly proportional to the thickness of the membrane. Moreover, the present theory assigns a rapid increase in looseness with increase in the
thickness of the membrane. Were the membrane to function as a system of elastic
cords, the angular displacement of the tooth would be proportional to the thickness of
the membrane (the load being supposed constant): no matter how wide the membrane
