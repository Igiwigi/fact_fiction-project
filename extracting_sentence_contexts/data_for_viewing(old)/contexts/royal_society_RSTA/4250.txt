(i) the process of averaging, by which smooth vector fields are derived from a discrete
microscopic configuration with ‘occasional defects’, is not made precise in [1,2], nor in
any related work that I know of;

(ii) the higher order quantities which are important in order to make connections with, for
example, the (ad hoc) elastic-plastic decompositions of plasticity theory have had no
compelling geometrical interpretation, to date, by way of contrast with the Burgers vector,
dislocation density tensor, etc.

I address these two limitations in this paper. To be precise regarding (i), though, I do not
propose any particular averaging process, nor make any presumption regarding the density or
distribution of defects, rather I consider a ‘converse’ approach—that is, I ask if any discrete set
of points is ‘naturally’ associated with a given set of lattice vector fields. In fact the question has
to be more specific than this, if there is to be any mathematical resolution of the issue, and it is
made specific by constraining the vector fields in a manner that I outline towards the end of this
Introduction.

The final result, regarding (i), is that there is indeed a set of points associated with any set
of vector fields so constrained and that such sets of points have a regularity that derives from
a continuous (Lie) group structure. Also, the dimension of the group (i.e. the number of real
parameters required to specify a general group element) depends on the number of ‘higher
order quantities’, cf. (ii), involved in defining the set of vector fields. Thus, for example, when
the vector fields are constant in R°, so that the dislocation density tensor is zero, the relevant
continuous group corresponds to translation in R° and the corresponding set of points is a perfect
lattice. When the vector fields are such that only the dislocation density tensor is required, for the
