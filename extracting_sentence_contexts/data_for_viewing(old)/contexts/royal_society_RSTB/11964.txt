A key implication of the work discussed here is that the
psychological basis of impulsive choice as measured by stan-
dard test instruments can be biased by an individual
preference for risk. Individuals who are more risk averse can
be misidentified as more impulsive if risk attitudes are not
measured directly. Fortunately, evidence from neuroimaging
and studies of impulse control disorders suggests that risk pre-
ferences do not account for the majority of the variance in
discount rates—even when the empirical techniques used
entangle the two measurements; rather the two appear to be
partly independent contributors to impulsive choice. This
means that we are not suggesting all results reported in the
literature are invalidated by the fact that the measurement tech-
niques used may be confounding risk and time preferences.
However, in some particular psychiatric conditions, risk and
time preferences may be going in the opposite direction of
that predicted by their relationship described here. Pathologi-
cal gamblers are one clear example of a population that
exhibits both steep discounting of delayed rewards and some-
what reduced risk aversion, and these behavioural profiles are
supported by both common and distinct neural correlates, as
shown by Mied et al. [99]. In this study, while the subjective
value of all reward types and in all subjects was encoded in
the brain’s valuation system, only encoding of the subjective
value of delayed rewards (but not risky rewards) was more
