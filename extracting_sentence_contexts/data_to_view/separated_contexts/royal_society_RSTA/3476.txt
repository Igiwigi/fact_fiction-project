This is because the stopping
tule, cooling schedule (that is, the decreasing sequence T; > T2 > T3---) and the Markov kernel
Q should ideally be tailored to each particular problem. In §3b and in the case study of §4, we
highlight particular considerations for the procurement problem under study. SA is in fact an adaptation of the well-known Metropolis—Hastings algorithm (see [22] and
references therein). That is, its goal is to obtain a sequence of random samples from a probability
distribution from which direct sampling is computationally challenging. The particular idea in
SA is that the mode(s) of these distributions are the minimizer(s) of the objective function f, and
hence the resulting samples will tend to be located in parts of the parameter space which are
approximately optimal.
