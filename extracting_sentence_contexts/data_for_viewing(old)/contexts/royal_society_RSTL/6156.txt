Maintaining artificially the heat of the animal by exposure to a high temperature
after division of the spinal cord, altogether alters the result. Thus, a rabbit in which
the spinal cord had been divided just below the phrenics, was placed in an atmosphere
where the thermometer stood at 88*. In three hours' time, when it was killed by
pithing, the temperature of its rectum was 1049. . The liver behaved precisely as if the
animal had been snddenly killed in its ordinary state, sngar being found, after an ordi-
narily conducted examination, to its usual extent.

Tt has also not escaped the observation of BERNARD, in experimenting on the frog,
that, according to the temperature of the animal at the time of death, the liver is found
with or without sugar after an ordinarily conducted examination. In the Â© Comptes
Rendus' of the Academy of Sciences, March 1857, he mentions this fact, and refers it to
a variation in the activity of the circulation, produced by the high and low temperature
leading to an increase or decrease, or even arrest of the glycogenic function. IT had
obtained results corresponding with those of BERNARD before I was aware he had under-
taken his experiments. Frogs in good condition, in which the liver is large, pale-
coloured, and exceedingly rich in amyloid substance, were exposed for two hours to an
atmosphere heated to 90% An examination of the livers in the usual way afforded a
decided indication of the presence of sugar. In other frogs, without exposure to *the
elevated temperature, the livers similarly examined gave no reaction with the Barreswil
solution. Whilst repeating these experiments, I accidentally met with a result for
which I was formerly at a loss to account. Some frogs that had been exposed to heat
happened to be placed aside in my laboratory for a quarter of an hour before they were
killed. Their livers, being examined, yielded scarcely an indication of a trace of sugar,
