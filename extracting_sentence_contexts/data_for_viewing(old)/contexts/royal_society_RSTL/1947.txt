known,—and many were 80 known ,—they have never been accurately distin-
guished from sensation and volition, and associated with a peculiar reflex fuane-
tion of the medulla oblongata and medulla spinalis, influencing other organs
besides the limbs, and constituting the principle of tone and of a particular
series of actions. It has long been known, for example, that the limbs of a de-
capitated animal moved on being stimulated; but the phenomenon was con-
founded with sensation and voluntary motion. It has long been known that
carbonic acid could not be inhaled through the larynx ; but it has not been
shown that this phenomenon depends upon the presiding ageney of the me-
qdulla oblongata; nor has it been distinctly demonstrated that the functions of
the sphincter ani, by which the intestinal excretions are retained for a time, is
constantly dependent upon a similar agency of the lower part of the medulla
spinalis. In like manner, the facts relative to the irritability were altogether
known before G11s80N and HaiLks finally separated this principle of motion
