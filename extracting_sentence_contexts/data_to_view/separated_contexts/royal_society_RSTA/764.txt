The dimensional changes which occurred during the period 1928-32,
although relatively large, happened to be roughly proportional to the dimensions
concerned, and the resulting change in the instrument constant was negligible. Still, it follows neither that even approximate proportionality held throughout the
interval, nor that it holds good for the changes which have taken place since the
end of 1932. In fact, the 1935 check measurements of linear dimensions show that
the last point on the curve of fig. 11 should be about 4 uV lower than it is, which
would make the curve steeper still. It is nevertheless realized that a change in the instrument cons
to an explanation of the distribution of the points of fig.
