Liarounorr has published an abstract of his work on figures of equilibrium of
rotating liquid under the title “Sur un Probléme de Tchebychef.” In this paper he
explains how he has obtained a rigorous solution for the figure and stability of the
pear-shaped figure, and he pronounces it to be unstable. In my paper in the
‘Philosophical Transactions’* I had arrived at an opposite conclusion. The stability or instability depends, in fact, on the sign of a certain function which
M. Lrarounorr calls A, and which I denote A)+>(B,)’/C’, where A) is equal to
