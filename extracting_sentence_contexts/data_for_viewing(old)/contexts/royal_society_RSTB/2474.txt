Shere is no need to drop the terms Eusporangiate and Leptosporangiate, but I think
they should be kept as descriptive words rather than as designating systematic
Edivisions. The difference of mode of origin implied by them marks no important
"g biological feature, whereas the distinction between Simplices, Gradate, and Mixte
& rests on facts of far-reaching biological significance in the production of spores, and
Zat the same time commends itself as conveying definite morphological conceptions ; it
3 is true intermediate steps may be found, especially between Gradatz and Mixtee, but
such transitions are inevitable in classifications where numerous allied genera and
8 species are involved.

Prantwâ€™s divisions of Leptosporangiate into Polyangia, Oligangia, and Monangia
do not commend themselves as either definite or useful. They touch the central idea
of number of sporangia, but that idea seems to me to be more fully embodied in the
divisions which I propose.

Probably no one would now uphold the exact converse of the views put forward
above, and contend that the Mixtee were the source from which the Gradatz and
