Now it can be seen by inspection of /(yp) that
such a change will have less effect on f(y») as X)-> 1. However, the deviations from linearity
in figure 6 increase as X,—> 1, and hence it must be concluded that the new formulation of
w cannot alone account for the discrepancies when X, > 0-5.

Ficure 7, Variation of partial molar heat content of benzene with composition. The fact that equation (10) holds with z = 2is really a consequence of the fact that empiric-

ally we find that AH, = 213X3cal./mole,
as shown in figure 7, since (10) reduces to this form when /’ = 1 and z = 2. However, equation
(10) gives AH, as the same function of X7, either for 7) = 2 and z = 2 or for r, = 1 with any

value of z. The latter would mean that the system is strictly regular, and any non-ideal
entropy of dilution could only arise as a result of the heat of mixing.
