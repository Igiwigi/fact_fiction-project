Accordingly,
the Helmholtz resonance condition may be expressed as

The above result (3.12) may be extended to determine complex poles [29], which are obtained by
solving for lz =0, see (3.10) above. For the thin-walled configuration this takes the form

2 1 1 t
ax = oo, here z° = — ex] = (5) +2%-1 + 8log{—]}. Note that for complex argument W; has in general an infinity of roots, j ¢ Z; however, as already
stated, the j = 0 term is discarded as it violates the asymptotic assumptions, and the remaining
roots (j#0,—1) do not in fact satisfy hg =0 upon re-substitution. So, if we input the geometric
parameters from our example above (i.e. 201mm and b © 17.9258 mm for k = 18.3074m~! in air)
in (3.12), we obtain k ~ 18.2549 — 0.7918im™? in air, directly, corresponding to the quality factor
Q=Re(k)/|2 Im(k)| 12 meaning that, in the context of acoustics, there is strong confinement of
energy for the resonator at this frequency.

or in the thin-walled case.

4. Asymptotic representations of scattering coefficients

In this section, we return to the leading-order exterior field representation from §3a and examine
the multipole coefficients in closer detail.
