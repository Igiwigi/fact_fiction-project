Space-time breaks down at singularities, hence singularities are not in space-time. This is one of
the great difficulties in trying to define what is a singularity in GR [20]. Penrose’s idea was to use
physical curves that do belong to the space-time, because curves are good pointers. If such curves
cannot be continued in a regular manner they are pointing towards a problem: the singularity. In
his theorem, Penrose used hypothetical light rays—null geodesics—that reach a sudden end, so
that one may interpret that they are actually ‘aiming at singularities’.

Resorting to geodesic incompleteness was a clever innovation that avoided the multiple
difficulties for a rigorous definition of singularity in GR. Hence, it eventually became (under the
influence of Hawking & Ellis [14] and Geroch [20]) the standard characterization of singularities
proven by the singularity theorems. Usually, only time-like or null curves are used, but in
principle also incomplete space-like curves define singularities. Moreover, the curves should
not need to be geodesic, and as a matter of fact there are known examples [20] of geodesically
complete space-times with incomplete time-like curves of everywhere bounded acceleration. It
must be remarked, however, that all singularity theorems to date prove merely the existence of
geodesic incompleteness, which of course is sufficient proof of incompleteness.

(b) Trapped spheres

The concept of closed trapped surface, in short trapped sphere if the surface has S? topology,
was a genius idea that characterizes the ‘point of no return’ in stellar gravitational collapse and
actually changed the path of GR for ever more.

In GR gravity is described by the geometry of space-time. Hence, in dynamical situations,
geometrical quantities such as area or volume do evolve with time. In very extreme cases, the
