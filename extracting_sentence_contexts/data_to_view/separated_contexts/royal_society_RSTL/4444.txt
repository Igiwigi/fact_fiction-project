What is
commonly called the affinity of hydrogen for oxygen is not sufficient to account for
this change, for hydrogen alone will not decompose the iodic acid, unless it be in the
nascent condition, When hydrochloric acid is the decomposing body, chloride of
iodine is formed, when hydriodic acid, the iodine itself. Are we not to admit that
these two substances are formed according to the same law? To this synthesis of
the iodine, the division of the element which takes place at the formation of the
bydriodic and iodic acids, is the correlative fact, to explain which we must assume
the same polar difference between its particles (see page 765). 2. In the course of his researches on the hypophosphites, Wurz discovered a very
singular substance, the bydruret of copper*, This substance is formed by the action
of hypophosphorons acid upon copper salts.
