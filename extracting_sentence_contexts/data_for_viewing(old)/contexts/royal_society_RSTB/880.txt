yellow and a red, but, on spectroscopic examination, it is found that the red colour is
due to greater concentration of the same pigment, which in thin layers may be
yellow, and in thick, red. Sometimes, however, two pigments, a yellow and a red,
may be present. It is found when such is the case, as in Nerophis equoreus, Cottus

bubalis, and Pleuronectes flesus, that the yellow can be separated from the red by

first extracting the skin with alcohol, and then with ether, the former taking up the —

yellow pigment, the latter the orange or red.

The fact ascertained by KRuKENBERG that the pigment of the Gold Fish, Carassius —
auratus, is tetronerythrin was confirmed, and the same pigment was found in the fins

of Trigla cuculus, but not in the skin of the body, which contained another red
lipochrome. The residue left by evaporation of the lipochrome solutions always
gave a blue or green coloration with nitric and sulphuric acids, but gave no marked
reaction with iodine in potassium iodide, although sometimes the reaction was obtained
by using Scuutrzr’s fluid. This negative result with iodine is often noticeable in the
case of animal lipochromes.

In all cases the melanins, the pigments contained in minutely granular form in the
black or brown chromatophores, were found to be very refractory towards solvents.
No connection could be traced between the lipochromes and the melanins, and in the
