Using extracellularly added antibodies follows the same
logic as surface proteolysis. Antibodies can bind only
surface-exposed epitopes and this binding can be detected
either by using antibodies labelled with fluorescent dyes or
enzyme conjugates. Whole-cell antibody-based assays
include dot blots, whole cell ELISA, immunofluorescence
and FACS analysis [114-116]. However, cell fixation tech-
niques can disrupt OM integrity as well as producing other
artefacts and it is best for antibody labelling to be performed
with live cells [117]. Labelling techniques, especially biotinylation, are widely
used for proteomic discovery of surface-exposed proteins
because they do not require the generation of protein-specific
antibodies: labelled proteins can be easily affinity purified
and analysed by mass spectrometry [118,119].
