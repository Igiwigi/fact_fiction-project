to white or neutral objects both large and small. In the case of extremely small, colourless
test objects, so small that their images would fall on single photoreceptors, the antichro-
matic responses come into play, to produce a colourless impression. So it comes about that
white objects of all shapes and sizes, appear white.

Experiments have been described which support the view that these photoreceptors are
collected into groups, or clusters, of sense organs of similar, or nearly similar, property.
These groupings make the process of colour neutralization somewhat more difficult; but
they clearly do not prevent it altogether, or a white object would be seen as though it were
mottled. It seems likely that a process of colour adaptation takes place locally. In fact,
adaptation as known at present may be nothing more than a demonstration of the presence
of this phenomenon.

Evidence has been advanced in Part XI, in support of the polychromatic theory, and in
Part IX for clusters of sense organs of similar property. It is possible that as many as seven
or eight different kinds of receptors are to be found in the human fovea. If this is confirmed,
two questions will require an answer: (1) Is it not very unlikely that clusters will occur
when there are present sense organs of so many different kinds? and (2) If, in fact, there
are all these different kinds of cluster, will not the mottling which they produce be very
troublesome when, for example, a uniform white surface is looked at?

The reply to the first question appears to be as follows: a cluster does not necessarily
