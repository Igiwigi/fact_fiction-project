the larvee from one colour to another it was found that the colour influence works
for about 20 hours preceding the last 12 hours of the whole period.

5. Blinding proved that the eyes do not form the organs which are influenced, and
it was also shown that the complex bristles do not contain a terminal organ with this
function. Experiments with conflicting colours appeared to prove that surrounding
colours affect the whole surface of the larval skin, although parti-coloured pups were
not obtained. (There is, however, some evidence for such a result in Papilio nireus.)

6. In all cases there are certain colours which produce no effects. In the
Vanessidee the brilliant metallic tints of the pup can be greatly influenced by the
presence of gilded surfaces in the environment of the larva before pupation. This
fact appears to prove that the metallic tints are essentially protective, and probably
subserve concealment by their resemblance to glittering minerals, such as mica. This
theory is confirmed by observations upon the habits of certain species with gilded
pupe. At the same time the gilded appearance has acquired another and opposite
significance in other species, being of use in rendering the pups conspicuous, and
thus acting as a signal of an unpleasant taste or smell.

7. The amount of pigment in the superficial layer of the cuticle in the pup of
Pieris brassicae and P. rape appears to be influenced by the spectroscopic com-
position of the light incident upon the larvee before pupation.
