Here, the item [Pr*xy| means the greatest integer number
not exceeding Pr‘x, (i.e. the Gaussian greatest integer function). For example, if Pr’ = 0.25 and
x, =7, then Pr**x, = 1.75, thus [Pr*x,| = [1.75] =1. The adoption of Gaussian greatest integer
function here is due to the fact that we need to ensure that the output number of each type of
alters is also an integer. Then we introduce constraints. Subject to: constraints of integer decision variables, of limited resources settings, and of upper
bound of kits’ number for each index can distribute.

To be specific, constraints (3.2) are our kernel constraints that ensure a fixed resource setting
for the optimal allocation of HIV prevention interventions.
