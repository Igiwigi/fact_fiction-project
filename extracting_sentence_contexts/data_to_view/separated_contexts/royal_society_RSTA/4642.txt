For every simply connected open set 2 of
finite measure in R?, we define

u € H3(2), uZ~O0r. One considers the problem

min{A(Q2) + |2|:2CR?, simply connected}. (4.2)


It has been conjectured since 1951 that the solution of this problem is the ball (see [22] for an
overview of open problems of spectral isoperimetric type). Following an idea of Willms and
Weinberger [23], a way to prove this fact is to prove the existence of a smooth set 2* solving (4.2). We refer to [24] for a proof of the existence, but still the smoothness question remains unsolved. Problem 4.4.
