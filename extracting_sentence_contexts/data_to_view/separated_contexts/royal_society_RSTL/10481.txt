It is a thick
bed of unconsolidated quartz-sand and pebbles, with numerous sponges and other
foxsils. Sponges predominate, and they are present in astonishing profusion. They
differ from those of the lower greensand of the Wealden area; not only in retaining
their complete entire forms, but in the fact that they are exclusively calcisponges. Not a single siliceous sponge has as yet to my knowledge been meb with in this
gravel, though these calcisxponges have been described by various authors as originally
slliceous. They thus present a striking contrast to the sponge-beds in other areas, in
which the sponges have been entirely disintegrated, and are also exclusively of
Siliceous origin.
