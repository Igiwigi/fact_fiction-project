mentioned that the bundles, which are collateral in the stem, become concentric —
as they enter the leaf. The extent to which the two bundles of the trace fuse
on entering the petiole varies in different specimens; in that represented in fig. 10
they partially fuse; in other cases (¢.g., C.N. 1984) they remain distinct. All the
primary tissues, vascular bundles, pericycle, inner and outer cortex are, as we should —
expect, perfectly continuous between stem and leaf. The limit between cortex and
pericycle is, however, difficult to trace at the point of junction. The sclerotic nests,
which in the stem are almost always limited to the pericycle, become distinctly —
cortical in the petiole, forming a conspicuous feature which helps to characterize
the species. + |

There is always a great development of these sclerotic masses in the axillary —
region, a fact which is worth noticing because these conspicuous groups of cells —
might be mistaken for rudimentary axillary buds. We find no evidence that —
such buds existed.

Exactly below the axil a characteristic transverse hypodermal band of black —
sclerotic tissue is fourid (see photograph 4 and fig. 10). This helps us to fix very
exactly the position of the transverse as compared with the longitudinal sections of
the node. The outer cortex of the stem closes in again almost immediately above the
level of the sclerotic band. '

The subject of phyllotaxis has already been dealt with. The arrangement is
evidently 3 in all the larger stems, in which the relative position of the leaf-trace
bundles is clear. In the smallest stems the divergence seems to have been 3.
