observations suggest the inference, that the blood-making process in the examples of
these Echinoderms is to some extent independent of floating cell-agenecy. The
absence of proper-cells from vital fluids, attest to the physiologist a near approach,
as respects the composition of such fluids, to the standard of an inorganic body. And
the novel truth will flow from these researches, that, in structure and mechanism of
nutrition, the living solids of the organism descend from the complex to the simple
in the same degree as that in which the fluids may have fallen in the scale of vitality.
During the examination of the fluids of other classes, the singular fact will be
established that the chylaqueous fluid of the young of the Annelid, and of the laryz of
some Insects, is scarcely, if at all, corpusculated ; that the fluids become more and more
ICbarged with floating-cells the older the animal becomes, and that these cells actually
Schange their structural characters as the growth of the animal advances. What is
etransitory in the Annelid and the Insect, may be the permanent condition in the
SEchinoderms. Then, the paramount question arises, in the absence of floating-cells
Sfrom the fluids of the Echinoderms, in what manner are those fluids vitalized, raised
from the inorganic to the organic condition ? It is probable that as all the fluid which
Beaches the visceral cavity passes through the digestive organs, and transudes the solid
Sarietes of the latter, by which it receives the impress of the vital force from the
Aiving Solids, its organic matter as8umes the form of albumen and fibrine, which,
=incorporating with salt-water, becomes a vital fluid.
