In two later papers HorsTMANN* has shown that when carbonic acid is added to
the mixture previous to explosion, more hydrogen and less carbonic oxide is burnt
than when the mixture is fired without carbonic acid. When a mixture of carbonic
acid and hydrogen is exploded with insufficient oxygen to burn all the hydrogen some
of the carbonie acid is rednced to carbonic oxide.

The influence of carbonic acid, he says, is not the same as that of nitrogen,
but resembles it ; direct experiments show that it is impossible to replace the excess
of combustible gases in part by carbonic acid, without altering the coefficient of
affinity. Carbonic acid, which has a higher specific heat than the simpler gases, pPro-
duces a greater effect than an equal volume of nitrogen, hydrogen, or carbonic oxide.
This fact, confirms the earlier conclusion that the coefficient not only depends upon the
percentage of oxygen, but also on the temperature of combustion. Steam acts in
a manner analogous to carbonic acid. Such are HonRsTMANN's conelusions as to the
function of inert gases in the explosive mixture. But in one paragraph he views the
reaction in a different light :—

«The burning appears as a preliminary of secondary importance, through w
established the conditions antecedent to the reactions coming particularly into con-
sideration, The chemical equilibrium is brought about by the two reciprocal trans-
formations between carbonic acid and hydrogen on the one hand, and carbonic oxide
