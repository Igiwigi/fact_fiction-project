Sreckoned at t equals 315° C., and has its vertex approximately in the line along which
EvPt/dac i is reckoned. F A similar investigation was made for the same wire for a current of 0°6 ampere, : and
eit was found that the curve for d*¢/dx? in this case cut the axis of temperature at
360° 8C. E The fact that d*t/da*® is nought at a particular temperature tells us, of course,
E mathematically nothing about the actual value of dt/dx, but from our general know-
Aledge of temperature curves, we know that when a current is passing through a fine
wire, as in our experiments, the temperature will rise rapidly along the wire in the
neighbourhood of the supports, then rise more slowly, and at no great distance from
the supports the temperature curve will become nearly flat, and will be absolutely flat
over the middle portion of the wire. We are, therefore, justified in assuming that d?¢/dx* and dt/dx are nought at about
the same point of the wire. On examining the numbers in Table V., which refer to the 6-mil wire, it will he
noticed that the mean temperatures of the wire for currents of 1'4 and 0°6 ampere
respectively, were 314° C. and 60°2 C., which are almost exactly the temperatures
