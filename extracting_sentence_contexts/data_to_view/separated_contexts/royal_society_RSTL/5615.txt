402 MR. FAIRBAIRN ON THE RESISTANCE OF TUBES TO COLLAPSE. This constant failure at the joints renders the experiments on internal pressure
unsatisfactory, as they do not exhibit the ultimate strength of the plate, but onl
strength of the joint; and as boilers invariably present joints, these facts are proþ
of some significance when applied to them. On a careful examination of the fract;
that of the tube Ef appeared the most perfect. Ke was not 80 well soldered, and

through the rivets; the plate of which this tube was composed was, however, exc
