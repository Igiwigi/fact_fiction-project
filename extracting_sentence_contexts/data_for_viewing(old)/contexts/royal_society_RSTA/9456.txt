rate of variation of the intensity of magnetisation “ with respect to the temperature @ depends upon the

THE EUTECTOID TRANSITION POINT OF CARBON STEELS. 185

In the stronger field however, the effect of the return of magnetisability, at the
same temperature, is much more pronounced than in the earlier experiments.

550° 600° 650° 700° = 750° 800°C

These differences are no doubt due to the fact that in weak fields the susceptibility of
the iron in the eutectoid is much smaller compared with that of the excess iron than
it is in strong fields.

The contribution of the carbide to the magnetisability of the material need not be
considered at high temperatures because it is known that it is relatively very feeble
above 250° C.*
