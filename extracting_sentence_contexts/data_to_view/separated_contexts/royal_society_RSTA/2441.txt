16. It is true that
in this flow the velocity at infinity would be
infinite, but then there is no irrotational con-
tinuous flow possible in the region which does
not have infinite velocity at infinity. The
flow is, in fact, no more impossible than is the
region in which it is supposed to take place. 43. Curve-factors not having a definite order
