2. Failure theories for homogenized composites 8

The first notable effort to describe failure of a homogenized unidirectional (UD) composite
appeared in 1965 by Azzi & Tsai [1], which became known as the Tsai—Hill theory. Hill [2] in
1948 proposed a generalization of the yield criterion for isotropic metals to orthotropic metals
by assuming six independent yield stresses: three for normal stresses in the three symmetry
directions and three for shear stresses in the three planes of symmetry. It is noteworthy that while
the von Mises criterion expressed in stresses is derivable from the distortional energy density, this
is not the case for the Hill criterion. Thus, Hill’s generalization of the von Mises criterion is simply
a mathematical generalization. Still, one can argue that it is relevant to yielding of metals. Hill,
in fact, motivated his criterion from the need to describe yielding in metals that develop texture
from sheet forming by rolling, resulting in orthotropic symmetry. The Azzi-Tsai adaptation of
the Hill criterion to UD composites was motivated by assumed similarity of the rolling direction
in metal sheets and the reinforcing direction in UD composites. The final equation, referred to
as the Tsai—Hill criterion, was derived by equating the six yield stresses in the Hill criterion to
the corresponding ‘strengths’ of a UD composite, and further assuming transverse isotropy in
the composite cross-sectional plane. Because the UD composites used as layers in laminates are
usually thin, the criterion is commonly used in its two-dimensional version, given by

x x Y S
where 0 and 09 are the normal stresses in the fibre and transverse directions, respectively, 012 is
the in-plane shear stress, and X, Y and S are the strength values of 01, 02 and 042, respectively. For
unequal strengths in tension and compression, a variation of equation (2.1) is easily derived.
