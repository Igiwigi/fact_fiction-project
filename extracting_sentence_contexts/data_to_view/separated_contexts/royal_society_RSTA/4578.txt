We have just started analysing a recent very large [4
ensemble of 100 historical simulations with an updated model version MPI-ESM-1.1, finding that : s
the spread of the simulated 30-year-long trends over the single period 1975-2004 is for this single : =
model even larger than that given by all CMIP5 simulations from all models that were used to [2

construct internal variability as described in the previous paragraph. This indicates that the change in start dates can indeed primarily be interpreted as a synthetic
increase of the ensemble size that we can analyse. The overall contribution to the range that stems
from the fact that the examined variables do change over time independent of internal variability
is very small: this forced component can be estimated by examining for each simulation a linear
regression through the individual data points for all start years. Such an analysis shows that
usually less than 10% of the total range can be explained by the change in forcing over the 10-
year-long period. Such a small contribution does not qualitatively affect the present analysis, so
it is neglected in the following for simplicity.
