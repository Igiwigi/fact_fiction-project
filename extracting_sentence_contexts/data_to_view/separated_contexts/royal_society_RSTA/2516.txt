Hilbert’s question can be reformulated in terms of algorithms: What is the simplest algorithm
for a given problem? At the current state of the art, the only way to guarantee that the software at hand is indeed
without errors is to use verification tools to obtain a formal proof. In fact, according to the ISO/IEC

2In this article, the term proof theory always refers to the subfield of structural proof theory. The areas of ordinal analysis and
reverse mathematics are not discussed here.

3Proof normalization will be discussed in §2a below. Common Criteria*, the highest level of assurance (EAL7) for software is achieved by formal
mathematical proofs of the correctness.
