which is conditioned by the extent of the surface of the platinum black, as otherwise
it is not quite clear why hydrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide, and sulphur dioxide
should all be absorbed in equal volumes. On the other hand, we have to deal with
the equally significant fact that neither nitrogen nor carbon dioxide are absorbed
except in comparatively small quantity. If, however, we confine our attention to
the occlusion of oxygen by platinum black, the balance of the evidence which we can
bring forward at the present time seems to indicate the formation of a definite
compound or oxide.

Tf, in the first place, the occlusion of oxygen were merely the physical condensation
of oxygen in the capillary pores of the platinum black, we should expect that raising
the temperature would either have very little effect or would simply re-evaporate the
condensed oxygen, whilst, as a matter of fact, rise of temperature is accompanied by
increased absorption up to the temperature of about 360°-380° C., when the oxygen
is again given off.

This behaviour seems to militate against the view that we are dealing with physical
condensation or liquefaction in the pores. Solid solution however is not excluded ;
but if it be remembered that platinum black absorbs about 100 volumes of oxygen,
whilst there is no authenticated case on record in which platinum in the concrete
form has been known to absorb more than a few volumes at the outside, it would
follow that, if we were really dealing with solid solution, platinum in all its forms
should absorb approximately the same quantity of oxygen, although we would be
quite prepared to find a different rate of absorption in the different forms.
