ship, say, like the * Minotaur * or Â© Agincourt * (400 feet in length, and with fine tapering
extremities burdened with towering masses of armour), when pitching in Atlantic waves,
undergoes a $uccession of stresses of great magnitude, undoubtedly requiring to be brought
as much as possible within the grasp of calculation, the more 80 as these stresses undergo
continual changes, sweeping through the fabric, 80 to speak, with prodigious yelocity.
The employment of iron and steel, and the improvements which the manufacture of
both is undergoing, fortunately facilitate the concentration of the strength of the ship
in those parts which are subject to the greatest stresses; and to further this object, a
closer knowledge of these stresses than has hitherto been possessed is much needed.
Bovevss, the author of the famous * Traits du Navire * (1746), was one of the earliest
authors who gave consideration to the strains bronght upon ships by the unequal distri-
bution of weight and buoyancy. 'The approximate and imperfect character of his theo-
retical investigations will readily be seen from the fact that he asumes the immersed
portion of the ship to be formed of the halves of two equal right cones, set base to base,
with their common axis in the water-line. He then constructs a curye the ordinates of
which represent the areas of the corresponding sections of the cones, and this he calls
the curve of buoyancy for the body. It necessarily comes out a parabola for each cone.
He next as8umes that the weight of the ship and her lading is uniformly distributed
throughout the length, s0 that it can be represented by a rectangle which stands on the
same base as the parabolic curve, and includes an equal area, the latter condition being
fixed by the necessity for the displacement equalling the total weight. His investigations
have, however, the merit of exhibiting an early example of that graphical or geometrical
method of illustrating the distribution of weight and buoyancy which has since been
employed by many authors, which Professor RANKINE in particular has recently used
with great advantage, and which I have adopted throughout the following investigations.
