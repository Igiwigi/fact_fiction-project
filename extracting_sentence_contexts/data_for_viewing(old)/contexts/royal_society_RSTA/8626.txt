is nothing to prevent an irrelevant distinction being drawn among the hypothetical
conditions represented by X, so that we have to consider two hypothetical possibilities
X, and X,, on both of which A will occur with equal frequency. Such a distinction
should make no difference whatever to our conclusions ; but on the principle of inverse
probability it does so, for if previously the relative probabilities were reckoned to be
in the ratio # to y, they must now be reckoned 2¢ to y. Nor has any criterion been
suggested by which it is possible to separate such irrelevant distinctions from those
which are relevant.

There would be no need to emphasise the baseless character of the assumptions made
under the titles of inverse probability and Bayrs’ Theorem in view of the decisive
criticism to which they have been exposed at the hands of BooLr, VENN, and CurystTA.,
were it not for the fact that the older writers, such as LAPLACE and Porsson, who accepted
these assumptions, also laid the foundations of the modern theory of statistics, and have
introduced into their discussions of this subject ideas of a similar character. I must
indeed plead guilty in my original statement of the Method of the Maximum Likeli-
hood (9) to having based my argument upon the principle of inverse probability ; in the
same paper, it is true, | emphasised the fact that such inverse probabilities were relative
only. That is to say, that while we might speak of one value of p as having an inverse
probability three times that of another value of p, we might on no account introduce
the differential element dp, so as to be able to say that it was three times as probable
that p should lie in one rather than the other of two equal elements. Upon considera-
tion, therefore, I perceive that the word probability is wrongly used in such a connection :
probability is a ratio of frequencies, and about the frequencies of such values we can
know nothing whatever. We must return to the actual fact that one value of p, of
