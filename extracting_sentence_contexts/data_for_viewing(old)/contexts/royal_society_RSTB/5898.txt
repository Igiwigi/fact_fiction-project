It also occurred in FrasuManâ€™s Australians and in the only Australian brain in my collec-
tion. Another feature of the Negro brain, the lower (more lateral) position of the
superior frontal (PoynTER and KEEGAN) seems also to be reflected in the lower position
of the midfrontal. Perhaps this is due to a lesser development of the middle region of the
frontal lobe, a possibility also alluded to by the forenamed authors. Naturally the
question arises whether the less frequent interruption of the midfrontal, and especially
of its connection with the inferior precentral in the latter race, may be interpreted as a
symptom of a lower organisation in this part of the brain,

Although some of the facts mentioned may induce us to accept a simpler organisation

of the Negro brain we should be careful in basing this chiefly on the midfrontal fissural
relations, since this condition is also found in European longheads, although perhaps less
frequently.

The same holds good for the long prelunate sulcus mentioned by Poynrer and Kercan for the Negro
brains, but occurring also in the pictures of dolichocephalic Dutch brains described by Wane Hwer Wen
