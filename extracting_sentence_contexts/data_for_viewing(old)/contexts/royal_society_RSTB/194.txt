only evidence of this appears to be that the animal can move about slowly without knocking against
obstacles.

322 DR. 8. BROWN AND PROFESSOR E. A. SCHAFER ON THE FUNCTIONS

usual result obtained in such cases—viz., at first total blindness, followed after 4
few days by a considerable amount of recovery—subsequent destruction of the an;
gyrus of one side caused hemianopsia which appeared permanent. But there
reason to believe that the permanent blindness in this case was due, not to the lesion
of the angular gyrus, but to the fact that, in removing this convolution, a part of t!
occipital lobe which had been left from the first operation was also removed. The
temporary complete blindness which often follows even incomplete ablations of the
occipital lobe is easily understood, if we remember that the immediate effect of such
ablations may extend to the parts of the lobe which are not actually involved in th
removal—a temporary disturbance of their function being produced by the interferen
with the circulation in the adjoining parts, owing to the occlusion of the blood-vessels
of the ablated portion, and also by the removal of the support which they naturally
obtained from that part whilst still im situ. These conditions of disturbance soon.
remedy themselves, but while they last they must affect the fanctions of the parts
which are thus disturbed.

Our present results are at variance with those of Frrrter, who denies that the
