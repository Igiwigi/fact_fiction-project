Figs. 7, 8,
and 9 are photographs of these pits in glass-cast cadmium. It will be seen that they
are systems of geometrical figures which remain similar and similarly situated over
the entire surface of a single grain, but change in character from one grain to the
next. These pits appear to be excessively small bubbles or blow-holes which have
taken a geometrical shape, forming, in fact, negative crystals. During the crystal-
lisation the crystalline elements have built themselves around the gas bubbles in
regular orientation, finally leaving the pits as we see them. In support of this view
the appearance seen on fig.
