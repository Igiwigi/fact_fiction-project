142 R. N. SALAMAN ON THE POTATO VIRUS “X”:

DIsTRIBUTION OF THE X” sTRAIN IN AN UP-TO-DATE PLANT

When it was found that plants of the variety Up-to-date owed their freedom from
systemic infection by the X% strain to the fact that they were carriers of the non-
pathogenic X” strain, it seemed possible that the occasional local reaction or localized
systemic infections which did occur might be due to unequal quantatitive distribution of
the protecting strain or its temporary absence from some portion of the plant. To test
this an examination of tissue for its virus content was made from several levels of the
same Up-to-date plant. Three weeks later the same plant was re-examined.
