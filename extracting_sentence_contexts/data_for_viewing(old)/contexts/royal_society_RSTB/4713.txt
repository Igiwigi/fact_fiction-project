of Mammals,” ‘Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc.,’ 206, B, October, 1914, pp. 1-48, 7 plates—a search for the
homologue of the mammalian vomer “seems to lead to the conclusion that it is represented in the lower
forms by the median bone which is usually called parasphenoid ” (p. 28).

§ Watson, D. M.S., ‘ Bull. Geol. Soc. Amer.,’ 28, December, 1917, p. 984:—‘‘ The mode of origin
of the mammalian vomer is much more like that of the reptilian parasphenoid than that of the reptilian
vomer.” Also Watson, 34, p. 365, No. 39 :—‘“ The vomer of Ornithorhynchus has a very similar position
to the rostral part of the parasphenoid of reptiles”; and (p. 385) :—‘“ These facts seem to me to establish
a case, too strong to be lightly set aside, for the homology of the os paradoxum [of Ornithorhynchus] with
the reptilian prevomers, and of the mammalian vomer with the rostral part of the parasphenoid of
reptiles ;” and (p. 360):—* In the ‘ Therocephalian’ Lycosaurus there is a large parasphenoid appearing
on the palate in the exact region oceupied by the mammalian vomer of Cynognathids ;” and (p. 360) :—
“The whole of this evidence taken together seems to me to support Broom’s view of the homology
of the mammalian vomer, although it is not yet quite conclusive.”

|| Gregory, W. K., ‘ Bull. Geol. ‘Soc. Amer.,’ 28, December, 1917, p. 975 :—The parasphenoid of
authors probably gave rise to the mammalian vomer, as held by Broom.
