If this could
be shown to be the lower jaw the resemblance to a young Ceratodus would he indeed
remarkable. Unfortunately none of our other specimens have afforded evidence that
would confirm this identification, and we are compelled somewhat reluctantly to
abandon it in favour of that we have already proposed. Again, as a matter of fact, structures corresponding to the hemidomes are not
present in Ceratodus, nor if they were, is it easy to see how the eye could have been
placed in the posterior compartment, which is unprovided with a foramen, through
which the optic nerve could find issue to it. Tempting as the Dipnoan interpretation certainly is, we are unable to adopt it,
chiefly on account of the great apparent difference in the nature of the suspensorium
and manducatory apparatus. Sir J.
