Bradbury theory, and it is unlikely that our estimate is as far wrong as this.

If information were available concerning isoelectronic molecules such as Fj, Cl}, Cl O,
etc., the matter could be more definitely decided, but such information is unfortunately
very meagre. However, Elliott & Cameron (1938) have made a preliminary examination
of the band spectra of Cl} and find a system of doublet bands which are either of //-J7 or
A-A type. As it is difficult on theoretical grounds to see how they can be A-A bands, it is
almost certain that they arise from transitions to the ground 2//, level from an upper 2/7,
level (see B 2-2). The binding energy of this ground level is found to be 4:4eV. As the con-
figuration of this level, ifa */7, term, is exactly the same as that of the ground level of O5 we
are considering, except that the orbitals are three-quantum ones, it seems unlikely that our
estimate of 3-8 eV as the binding energy of O; °//, is in error in excess. Some further evidence
to this end is afforded by the fact that the binding energy of F,, which is admittedly not very
well known, indicates that, for molecules containing nearly complete two-quantum shells,
the binding energy per bond is greater, not less, than 2-5eV. We therefore take 1 eV as a
reasonable estimate of the electron affinity of O;.

The internuclear distance in the ground state is probably somewhat greater than in that
(1-20A) of the neutral molecule. A rough estimate may be made in the following rather
indirect way. In the °/Z, state of Cl} the equilibrium nuclear separation is 1-88 A, slightly
less than in the ground state of the corresponding neutral molecule Cl,. We can therefore
assume that the nuclear separation in the ground 2/7, state of Fj is about 1-4 A (slightly less
than that, 1-5 A, regarded as probable for F,). A value between 1-3 and 1-4 A is therefore a
reasonable one to take for Oj, as it should be very similar to F}.
