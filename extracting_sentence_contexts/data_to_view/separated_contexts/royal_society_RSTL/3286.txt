Before the speculum is polished, it is worked to a spherical figure by a process
technically called grinding, where the mutual attrition of the speculum, and a mass
of nearly equal size of some hard substance, eventually produces a figure nearly
spherical ; and that, notwithstanding the irregularities, however great, of the sur-
faces of either, or both, at the commencement of the operation. Several ingeni-
ous devices have been, indeed, from time to time, suggested, more or less inde-
pendent of the process of grinding, among which, perhaps, the most remarkable is
that of Mr. Barron, who proposed to communicate the figure and the polish
at once, by turning the speculum with a diamond, constrained, by very delicate
machinery, to moye in the proper path, and with a motion s0 slow that the
rexulting grooves should act on light as a polished surface; but when we recollect
the extreme accuracy required, that an error of figure amounting to but a small
fraction of a hair's hreadth would destroy the action of a speculum, it is scarcely
to be expected that any process can succeed in practice, which has not, like that of
grinding, a decided tendency to correct its own defects, and to produce a result in
which the errors may be said to be infinitely small in comparison with the errors in

any of the previous steps from which it was derived. I need, perhaps, therefore hardly
say that all my experiments have been directed to the one object, that of endeavour-
ing to improve the common published process of grinding and polishing, particularly
in its application to large surfaces; for although the accuracy usually attained is 80
great that we fail in detecting by mechanical means, among a variety of specula made
at different times and by different persons, any deviation from the proper figure, 8till
by optical means, in fact, by trial in a telescope, the defects are at once apparent ; and
we shall probably find among them examples of every grade of defining power, from
the speculum which is almost perfect, to that which does not define at all. This dif-
