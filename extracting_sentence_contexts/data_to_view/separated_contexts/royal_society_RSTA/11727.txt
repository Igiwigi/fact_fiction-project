The preliminary discussion of individual substances has further abundantly shown
that although some of the lines belonging to any particular metal may appear as dark
lines in the solar spectrum on account of absorption by the chromosphere, other lines
of the same substance are only represented among the dark lines because of absorption
taking place elsewhere. This again is an indication of the stratification of the sunâ€™s
absorbing atmosphere, which, if it exists, must furnish a very strong argument in
favour of the dissociation of metallic vapours at solar temperatures. In fact, the

eclipse phenomena have been found to be as bizarre, in relation to the non-dissociation
hypothesis, as those which I have already discussed in relation to observation of
sun spots and of the chromosphere and prominences without an eclipse.
