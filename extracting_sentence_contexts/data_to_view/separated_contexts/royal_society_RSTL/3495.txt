The accordance exhibited by the computed and the actual breaking weights,
evinces the general accuracy of the formula, as applied to this form of beam ; while
these results, compared with those computed for direct tensile force alone, show how
large a proportion of the strength of cast iron, when subjected to transverse strain,
is due to the resistance arising from the lateral action. It will also be seen that comparisons of the relative strengths of different forms of
section, calculated, as has been customary, on the assumption that the resistances
are constant forces, or governed by a constant coefficient, must be entirely fallacious. It was my intention to have included in this paper a similar investigation as to
the position of the neutral axis, and the amount of the resistance arising from lateral
action of the fibres in wrought iron; but as the experiments will take some time
to complete, and as the facts elicited in reference to cast iron are of sufficient import-
ance to render it, desirable that they should be made known, I will reserve the
examination of wrought iron for the subject of another communication. IN BEAMS SUBJECTED TO TRANSVERSE STRAIN. 237
