S These are the data furnished by observation for every object in a complete
2 Sweep; and I shall now explain how from these data, compared with the mean
Z places of all those known objects which are to be found in authentic catalogues
= brought up to a given epoch, and which occur in a s&weep, the mean places
S of all the wnknown ones for the same epoch may be obtained, with the greatest
> degree of accuracy of which the system of observing is susceptible,—without the
7 necessity of taking into direct consideration any uranographical or instru-
5 mental correction whatever,—and that in a manner which, as will appear, carries
FI with it a moral certainty of eliminating (0 far as they can be eliniinated by
E any process) whatever errors may have been committed in the observations of
EZ the zero stars. In fact, if we consider all the corrections which we can pos-

E sibly have occasion to apply to obseryations of this kind, whether arising from

S the uranographical reductions, (viz. precession, aberration, nutation and refrac-

= tion,) or from instrumental mis-adjustment, such as extrameridional situation

z of the plane of the sweep, or its deviation from a vertical ; error and rate of

the chronometer ; error of evaluation of the divisions of the sector, &c.; or,
lastly, even from instability of the instrument itself, due to hygrometrical or
pyrometrical causes, whose operation, though very irregular, is still to a cer-
tain extent gradual ; we shall find that they are all functions of two quantities,
—the time elapsed since a given epoch, or, which comes to the same thing, the

sidereal time at the moment of observation ; and the inclination to the horizon
of the line of collimation, or, which comes to the same, the polar distance of
the object. Hence it follows that in all cases the mean R. A. of an object,
observed must necessarily be derived from the observed chronometer reading,
(reduced to the first wire,) by adding to that reading a reduction (R) which
is some certain function of these two quantities, and that the mean polar di-
stances, also reduced to the same fixed epoch, will in like manner be had/from
the reading of the index arc or lateral sector, by adding thereto another re-
duction (7), which is also a function of the same quantities.
