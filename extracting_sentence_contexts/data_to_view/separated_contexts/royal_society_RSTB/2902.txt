In this species the interlamellar septa are fewer,
and the interfilamentar spaces wider than in the other three. Diplodonta oblonga, although usually placed in the family Lucinide, has the outer
demibranch present. The degree of importance to be attached to this fact has been
discussed by Prtsenrer (68, p. 16), by MÃ©ntcaux (62, p. 237), and by Dau
(15, p. 545), the last recommending the separation of Diplodonta from the Lucinide
to constitute a new family, the Diplodontidee. The lamelle are homorhabdie, and
moderately plicate (fig. 24B) with about fifteen filaments to the plica. The filaments
have interlamellar extensions, rather less well-developed than in Lucina, which fuse
