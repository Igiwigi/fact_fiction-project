the formation of stalagmite *; and, in fact, Mr. PeExGeLLY has shown that under such
conditions (probably sheltered places) stalagmite did form alternately with the cave-earth. It would therefore follow that those bones which, from time to time, were exposed on
the surface of the floor of the cave to the drip from the roof would receive an incrusta-
tion of carbonate of lime of thickness proportionate to the time between their being
left by the predatory animals on the floor of the cave, and their being covered up by
8ilt (the cave-earth) from some subsequent inundation.
