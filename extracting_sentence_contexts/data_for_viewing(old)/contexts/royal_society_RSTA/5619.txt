adequate regulations as well as for validating whether reduction targets are in fact being met.
Scientific methods exist, are being further developed and have been applied around the world
to detect, locate and quantify emitters across the emission size distribution to support such
mitigation [12,13].

One of the so-called unconventional gas production sources is coal seam gas (CSG), sometimes
also labelled coalbed CH4. Complete global production data of CSG are usually not publicly
available, but CSG accounted for about 5% of natural gas production in the USA throughout the
2010s [14], 24% of Australia’s gas production in 2018 [15,16] and rapidly increasing amounts in
China (the world’s largest coal producer), for which reliable CSG production data are difficult to
obtain [17]. Given the operational differences between CSG and other forms of O&G production
(including dry and wet gas production from conventional and shale formations), it is essential
to understand CH, emissions from CSG production alone. This includes the fact that CSG fields
require more gathering lines, pumps and compressors than conventional gas fields because (i)
CSG wells are less productive (i.e. larger number of wells needed) and (ii) they produce gas at
lower pressure [18].

CHy4 emissions from CSG production are not well characterized as this source of the O&G
supply chain is currently under-sampled in the peer-reviewed literature. Most published research
has been carried out in the Surat Basin in Queensland, Australia, which produced 77% of
Australia’s CSG in 2018 [15,16]. The portion of the Surat Basin covered by the work presented
here represents 57% of the Queensland Government gas production inventory. According to the
Australian Government, about 0.5% of Australia’s produced CHy is emitted to the atmosphere
[18,19]. Six previous ground surveys of CH4 emissions from the Surat Basin CSG fields are
reviewed in [12,20]. These ground-based surveys focused on identifying point sources and
