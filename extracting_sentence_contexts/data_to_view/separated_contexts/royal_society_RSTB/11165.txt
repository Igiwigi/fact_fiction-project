This wave propa- been reported for Cdc42 [53,54] and Ras [55-58]. Alternatively,
gation is most clearly shown in the cortical pattern at the different pathways could positively feedback to each other,
basal surface but the same is true for waves associated with such as between PI3 K and Ras pathways [59,60] or between
the leading edge of the migrating cells [35,43] or neuronal phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) and
branches [44]. In fact, even in the absence of high-resolution flu- Rho pathways [61]. Pathway cross-talk is empirically defined
orescence imaging, it has been recognized that cortical waves without knowing the precise network structures. Lastly, a
