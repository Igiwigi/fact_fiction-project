fatty acids on steel.

It has been shown that the extent of the wear varies for different substances but that
even with the best lubricants some tearing of the surfaces is observed. The sliding effects
are therefore not confined to the adsorbed layers of the lubricant but penetrate deeper
and cause abrasion and distortion of the underlying metal. In addition, elastic inter-
action of the surface irregularities must be taking place continually during sliding and
this may be an important factor determining the frictional force. As in the case of
unlubricated friction, therefore, a complete interpretation of the phenomena must
take into account, not only the surface properties, but also the bulk properties of the
sliding solids.

The fact that friction is not a purely surface effect is also brought out by the
experiments on multilayers described in this paper. This work shows that although a
single molecular layer may be capable of reducing the friction and wear, the protective
layer is rapidly worn off during sliding with consequent increase in the friction and
wear between the surfaces. A layer many molecules thick wears off much more

slowly and therefore affords much better protection to the surfaces. A primary film
is therefore not enough, and for effective protection of the surfaces it is necessary to
have present between the surfaces a layer of lubricant several molecules thick.
