The first experiments on the incomplete combustion of hydrogen and carbonic oxide
were made by Hrnry. In a memoir printed in these Transactions (1824), Hexry
compared the action of the electric spark and of platinum sponge on mixtures
of carbonic oxide and electrolytic gas. He discovered the fact that the lower the
temperature at which the reaction occurs the greater is the proportion of carbonic acid
produced,

He writes : Â© I made numerous experiments to ascertain whether the oxygen, under
