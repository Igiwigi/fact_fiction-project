To
allow for integration, we add a regularization parameter by substituting the square of the energy


difference (¢, — €s)? by (€ — &s)° +n where 7 is a small real positive number (see appendix A for
more details).

(b) The moving crude adiabatic representation

The situation is different in the MCA representation. The electronic states are no more adiabatic
but instead solve the electronic Schrédinger equation only at one nuclear geometry, which is
chosen to be the centres of the Gaussian functions {Q,;(£)}:

Fe(Qax(t))1ps(Qsx(#))) = &s(Qax(6))les(Qsx(E)))- (2.7)

The molecular wave function now reads
Ns
M(t) => Y° Cu (les(Qex(6)))3(Qsx(H, Pax (6), (2.8)
s ok

and the molecular Hamiltonian

HYG O=- 5(vs(Qu(0)|pe(Quu(d))¥'V + (gs(Qex(#))| Hels (Qsi(8))). (2.9)

This last Hamiltonian is different from the Hamiltonians using adiabatic states (equations (2.5)—
(2.6)) in the sense there are no non-adiabatic couplings tss involved. This is due to the fact
that MCA states do not depend on the nuclear coordinates and are therefore strictly diabatic. Therefore, the non-integrable DBOC terms do not appear and all terms in the Hamiltonian
are now integrable. Even the non-adiabatic coupling vector t;s(X) does not appear in the
Hamiltonian, which makes the numerical integration more stable.
