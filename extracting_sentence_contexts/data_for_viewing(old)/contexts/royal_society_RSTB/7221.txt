by more than one observer and to compare the results. Details are given in Part III,
but I may state here that in many cases this has been found to be broadly true. Although the
absolute discrepancies (irrespective of the sign) were often large, positive and negative values
usually occurred in equal proportion so that they tended to cancel. The algebraic dis-
crepancy was thus much smaller, and decreased as the number of observers or the number
of observations was increased.

158. In sharp contrast to ‘sampling fluctuations’ and ‘observational errors’ of the type
described above, inaccuracies have also arisen from false entries or deliberate failure to
carry out instructions. (As already mentioned, in the case of the jute survey the field work
has to be carried out under trying weather conditions when moving about in villages is
difficult. In this situation some of the field investigators put down entries by pure guess work
without taking the trouble of going round the field. This risk is increased by the fact that most
of the investigators are employed only for ten or twelve weeks so that there is no permanent
hold on them.) The theoretical distinction between the second type of observational errors
and the third type of gross inaccuracies is quite clear. Observational errors are amenable
to statistical treatment. False entries and inaccuracies arising from gross negligence, on the
other hand, are not amenable to statistical or probabilistic treatment. In actual practice,
however, it is difficult to separate these two groups, and it is necessary to pool together the
second and the third types under one common head which may be called ‘recording mis-
takes’ arising from the human factor. Thus there are two broad groups, namely, (a) ‘sam-
pling fluctuations’, which come under the theory of statistical distribution, and (b) ‘re-
