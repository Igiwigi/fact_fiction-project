assembled structures. Those in general contain no or little oil. In real food systems, the quantity
of triglyceride is most often larger than the quantity of surfactants. In these conditions, little is
known about the phase behaviour and potential separation between the oil and the amphiphilic
molecules. In addition, food grade lecithin phase behaviour when mixed with oil is completely
unknown. Therefore, there is a need to decipher complex phase behaviour of food grade lecithins
when they are mixed with oil and water. This is of particular interest for oxidation and could also
be used for the control of Maillard reaction.

8. Conclusion

SASs formed by lecithin and MG can be used to control chemical reactions in food. Recent
studies show that reversed micelles control the oxidation of oil. In addition, Maillard reaction
yield of key aromas can be strongly increased when using SASs. Considering the fact that
food systems contain oil, it is of prime interest to master the phase behaviour of the system
surfactant (PL or MG), triglyceride and water. The literature concentrates mainly on the binary
surfactant/water system, but there is a lack of information on a system including triglycerides.
In this study, it was shown that addition of triglycerides in the MG water system is very
advantageous for the Maillard reaction, because the phase obtained at room temperature is of
low viscosity, which is much easier for processing. In addition, presence of oil leads to higher
product yields.
