+ invariance of (2.4), although in many cases this follows necessarily from the other invariances
present (frame indifference and point group invariance). Besides the analogue of magnetostatic
energy, the total ferroelectric energy also has terms arising from free charges that would have to
be considered.

The standard scaling of magnetoelasticity y(x) > Ay((1/A)x), m(y) > m((1/A)y) preserves the
energy wells and sends zero-energy solutions to zero-energy solutions, but multiplies curvatures
by a factor 1/4. Therefore, these solutions have the property that the curvature scales inversely as
a linear dimension as they are scaled down in a geometrically similar way. Consider the case of
the austenite /martensite structure of figure 4b. If the temperature is raised to 6 > 0p, then this is
no longer a zero-energy microstructure. In fact its energy at temperature 6 scales as the volume,
23, while elastic bending energies scale as 45. Thus, there is a strong driving force, forcing it back
to the unique (up to rotations and translations) reference configuration, figure 4b > 4a. For a finer
analysis, consider a beam of thickness ht, width b and length ¢ in the reference configuration, : =

and the austenite has typical extensional modulus E. We can imagine hanging a vertical weight Sy
on the end of the beam in figure 4b. The weight F will be lifted substantially by heating the 2
crystal, as the crystal returns to a nearly straight shape, if (i) the energy of raising the weight F is aed
comparable to the free-energy difference between phases at @ and (ii) the weight F is small enough 22
