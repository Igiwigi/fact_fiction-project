detection of a carotenoid (intact biomolecule) and eventual altered biomass which has undergone
metamorphic processes, carbonaceous matter represented by graphite and shungite were
analysed in the same manner. The lowest concentration level of 0.1mgkg~! was successfully
detected by observation of v(C=C) band of B-carotene in the gypsum matrix using the instrument
with 532 nm excitation (figure 7a). By contrast, the lowest concentration allowing the detection of
the graphite G-band and shungite G- and D-bands was 1g kg~! (figure 7b,c).

4. Discussion

This study follows our earlier results, where halite from the hyperarid zone of the Atacama Desert
was studied using an identical analytical approach [65].

The fact that 785nm excitation used with the miniaturized Raman system is good for the
detection of evaporitic minerals, but not favourable for detection of carotenoids compared with
532 nm system confirms our previous experience [65,76].

Higher levels of fluorescence background observed sometimes during the analysis of powders
compared with hard rocks were noted. We interpret this observation as a possible result of
dispersion of the fluorescent agent, which is not normally associated with the cells in the
powdered mixture. It resulted in the lower exposure times for the case of powders in contrast
to hard rock samples. This difference of exposure time was required to avoid oversaturation of
the detector during higher exposure times.

There is another possible reason for the higher S/N ratios observed in some cases of direct
measurement on the rock which is the role of the distribution pattern of microbial colonization
