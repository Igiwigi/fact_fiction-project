‘4 _ In order to establish the position of the pelvic girdle with relation to some fixed
= point, it was found necessary to examine the occipital region in each case and to
reckon from that. FirprincEr (1897) in the case of UM. vulgaris gives the formula
® of the spino-occipital nerves as y, 2, 1", 2", 3".... &c., in general, though he adds
9 that in some cases it may be a, y, z, 1, 2, 3"..,. Such was found to be the
S$ case in all the specimens examined, with the exception that in a few instances the
= first spinal nerve possessed a small dorsal root. This occurred both in ©. levis and
& M. vulgaris. The arrangement of the nerves in this portion of the body was found
= to be practically identical in the two species. The first spinal nerve in all cases
S issued by a deep notch (almost a foramen) at the base of the skull, and, in spite of
3 the fact that according to Rosenperc Mustelus is a genus showing vertebral con-
3 densation in this region, no variation could be detected. This was confirmed by the
a fact that the nerve denoted by y was always found below and slightly anterior to
& the posterior margin of the vagus foramen (Plate 13, fig. 1). Hence the first spinal
could be determined with certainty, and afforded a fixed point from which the
position of the pelvic girdle could be reckoned.

3. General Characters of Plexus.

The “nervus collector” in Mustelus levis is most usually composed of branches
from five nerves, though as will be seen later, this arrangement is subject to a con-
siderable amount of variation. The general character of the plexus is shown in
Plate 13, figs. 3 and 4. Of the four branches of the collector, the most caudal is
