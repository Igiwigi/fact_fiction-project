To obtain a good view of the process, it
is necessary to make a transverse section of the developing systems. It may then be
seen that osteal cells arrange themselves in single file within the Haversian space
with intermediate lines of transparent tissue, and here and there a lacunal cell; the
process commencing at the surface of the Haversian space, and extending gradually
inwards till the system is completed. In fact the soft tissue takes the permanent
form previous to the addition of the salts of bone, much in the same manner and
to the same degree as occurs in temporary cartilage before the earthy ingredients
are deposited. Lamination is nothing more than a definite linear arrangement of the
osteal cells with their outlines permanently retained in the perfected bone; a cha-
racter much more strongly marked in the bones of adult than in those of young
animals. In pursuing their inquiries into the growth of bone, the authors found it necessary
to take sections of perfectly fresh bone and to examine them in albuminous fluid ;
spirits of wine, whether diluted or not, obscures the normal appearances, and water
is not more favourable as a medium.
