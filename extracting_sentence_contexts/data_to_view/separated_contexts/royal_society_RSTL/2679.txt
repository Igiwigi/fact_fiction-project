PHILIP ON THE POWERS OF LIFE. 349

The question here arises, For what purpose is the influence of every part of the brain
and spinal marrow thus combined to be bestowed on these organs ? This question is answered by the experiments just referred to, which prove that the
influence of every part of the brain and spinal marrow is necessary to the due per-
formance of the functions of secretion and assimilation ; and by other facts to which
I shall have occasion to refer, which prove the necessity of the muscles of involuntary
motion being under the controul of the same power, on which these functions depend. All of them, as we have just seen, fail when any considerable part of the influence
either of the brain or spinal marrow is withdrawn, the failure of function being pro-
portioned to the degree in which the influence of either is withdrawn, proving that the
influence of every part of them is essential to the due performance of those func-
tions*. Important and extensive as these functions are, there is till another, hardly less
80, dependent on the powers of the nervous system properly s0 called.
