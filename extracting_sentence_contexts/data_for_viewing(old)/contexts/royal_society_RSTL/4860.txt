his anticipation.
& Dr. FRANKLAND'S remarkable observations on the action of zinc upon iodide of methyl
-Znd iodide of ethyl at high temperatures are still fresh in the memory of chemists.
Bexides the hydrocarbons methyl and ethyl, zine-methyl and zinc-ethyl are formed in
Mis reaction, which exhibit the deportment of true organic metals, comparable in the
Intensity of their combining powers with the most electro-positive elements. In the
Zetion of a chloride upon such a compound metal, the chlorine was sure to seize upon _
Jhe zinc, and it was extremely probable that, together with chloride of zinc, methyl- or
Sthyl-compounds would be formed in definite proportions. In the action of terchloride
ET phosphorus, the formation of a methyl- or ethyl-compound of phosphorus, correspond-
g's in composition to the terchloride of phosphorus, might be with certainty expected :
& PCl, + 3MeZn = 3ZnCl+Me, P
B These anticipations were in fact fulfilled. The products of these reactions, the bases
e,P and E, P, which we propose to call respectively trimethylphosphine and triethyl-
hesphine, remain united with chloride of zinc, and a simple distillation with an alkali
Allone is necessary to liberate them.
37nCl, Me, P+6KO=3KCl+3(KO, ZnO)+PMe,
3ZnCl, E, P+ 6KO=3KCIl+3(KO, ZnO)+PE..

They are obtained in this way as volatile oils, with a peculiar and strongly-marked
odour, and possessing distinctly basic properties.

We found no difficulty in procuring the bodies in question by this method in a state
of perfect purity, 80 as to examine their properties with accuracy.
