Background and history

Since the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA by Watson and Crick in 1953, many
mathematical hypotheses regarding how proteins are coded have been proposed [2]. Among the
most remarkable are those of George Gamow (crystal model [3]) and Francis Crick (comma-free
codes [4]). Despite the fact that both hypotheses were experimentally proved incorrect [5], Crick’s
proposal indicated clearly that coding theory is ‘the’ framework for interpreting the mechanisms
of protein synthesis. We quote here the words of Gamow ina letter to Watson and Crick [6, p. 10]:

[I] think that this brings biology over into the group of ‘exact’ sciences [...]. If your point
of view is correct, and I am sure it is at least in its essentials, each organism will be
characterized by a long number written in quadrucal! system [.. .]

Gamow trusted that this digital representation of genetic information would have opened a new
era in the understanding of life.
