The evidence advanced by Warer and Micuenson in support of this theory has
already been considered, together with Lorp Ray.eren’s ingenious hypothesis
which admits of an explanation in terms of “thin plates,” and which yet meets
Micuesoy’s objections. One of the principal difficulties connected with the surface
colour theory was pointed out by Mantock, who, as has been mentioned, showed
that all the iridescent structures he examined lost their colour when subjected to
moderate pressures, from which he concluded that the structure was of a mechanical
* rather than of a molecular nature.

I have repeated some of these experiments, and am able to confirm most of the
results, but, with the wing-cases of all scaleless beetles and certain iridescent dragon-
flies, bees, ete., I found that considerable pressures had no effect.t In fact, the lenses
invariably fractured without any change being seen in the colour. It may be
objected that the chitin of beetles’ wing-cases is so thick, that pressures would be
useless with them which were effective with scales. Exactly similar results were,
however, obtained with beetles having thin elytra, and with the thin surface layer
of wing-cases, which is scarcely thicker than many scales.

Moreover, if there were any alternating structures of which air formed one of the
plates, it should be possible to change or diminish the colour by replacing the air with
a refractive fluid. Nevertheless, all attempts by Lorp Rayuercu, Prof. Pouron,
and myself to drive out the air entirely failed. This was the case even when
small pieces of wing were used under a pressure of 0°5 mm. of mercury, to facilitate
penetration. Special efforts were made by applying both this test and the pressure
