direction parallel to the faces of a rhomboid'of g6* and 847; and
also, that they break in a direction parallel to the said faces,

The blue variety of perfect corundum, or sapphire, follows
the above law, as well as all the other varieties. It is true,
however, as I have already had occasion to mention, that the
ease with which the crystals of this substance may be divided,
is very various ; but observation shows, at the same time, that
these variations are governed, in the first place, by the degree
of force existing in the attraction of the molecules which com-
pose the crystals, as well as by the perfect adhesion of the
crystalline lamine (composed of these molecules) at all points
of their surface; two facts; the existence of which is shown
by the difference. in the degrees of hardness and transparency of,
this stone, and which appears to. be very. considerable. In the
second place, the variations here spoken'of seem also to depend
very much upon the colour these stones possess ; for, as I have
already observed, they must be governed by the force of
attraction, which, in my opinion, varies with the colour. This.
force appears to exist in the highest degree, in the perfect co-
rundum of a blue colour, or sapphire; it being with great diffi-
culty that this kind of corundum can be broken, in the direction
of its laminz, in such a' manner that its‚Äù fracture shall  present
that even surface, and that kind of gloss, which fractures made
in the above direction generally exhibit. It may be broken with
