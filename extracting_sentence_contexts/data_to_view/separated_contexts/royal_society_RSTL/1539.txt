VoLNney has attempted to show, in a recent pub-
lication ( Chronologie d' Herodote) that the eclipse, mentioned
by the historian, could be no other than the one which hap-
pened February gd, 626 B. C. Thus we find a distance of no less than forty-three years
between the extreme periods that have been assigned for
this eclipse : an interval which, however, may be somewhat
abridged ; since there are other facts recorded by the same
historian which enable us to reduce these limits, and yet leave
the narration consistent with itself. For, according to HreRopoTvs, the two kings of Media, that
immediately preceded the conquest of that country by Cyrus,
were Cyaxares, who reigned forty years, and Astyages, who
reigned thirty-five years: and it is admitted by all the chro-
nologists, that Cyrus conquered Astyages in the year 560
B. C.
