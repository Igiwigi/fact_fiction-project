The sphere whose radius is unity will be changed
Zinto an ellipsoid whose axes are Az, BB, Cy; and the axes of the other ellipsoids will
S be parallel and proportional to these. By

&is an important determining element. If we assume »' to denote what @ becomes in
Z consequence of the distortion, it may be easily seen that o' is a distributive function of
8» and Az+BB+Cy; and from this fact a number of curious symbolical relations
5 may be deduced. But I must not dwell upon this subject of distortion now further
= than my immediate purpose requires.

I may observe that the equation (8.), that is,

* Observing that © Z « =Dw. a, B=Do. B, 2 =Dw.y, we find the coefficient of y in the first member to be

0: +(B-A)wa,;
and putting U= Xa +YB+Zy, we find, in the second member,
Em(zY —yXN).
