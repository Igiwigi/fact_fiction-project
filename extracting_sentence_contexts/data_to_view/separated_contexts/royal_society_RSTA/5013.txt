However,
their conclusion that improvements were associated with narrow y channels was not supported
by a model and does not take into account the effect of the morphology (N-rafts or P-rafts). Furthermore, as the volume fraction of y’ increases, the mismatch changes, which determines
the morphology. In fact, it is known (see [43]) that the raft morphology at a given volume fraction
of y’ has a major influence on the creep life and that negative mismatch alloys producing N-rafts
have the best creep properties. In thermo-mechanical fatigue (discussed in §7), it is shown that
high temperature holds, even at low strains, can produce a rafted structure which undoubtedly
influences the life as discussed below. During cyclic loading, it was shown that coarsening occurred very rapidly without rafting.
