(the spring month, corresponding to March in this country). But lambs are
frequently born earlier or during winter. At high altitudes, however, where the
ewes subsist entirely upon the natural produce of the veldt, the lambing season is
stated to be October, from which it may be inferred that the sexual season also
begins a month later than the usual time over Cape Colony. On the other hand, in
the low country, below the second range of mountains, there are two seasons for
lambing, the autumn season being in April and May. But here the lambing periods
are limited, since the ewes do not usually come in season until about the middle of
December (WALLACE, 1896).

Probably the maximum amount of sexual activity reached by any sheep is that
attained to by the Merinos of some parts of Australia, which are described as being
able to breed all the year round, a fact which implies, in the absence of gestation, an
almost continuous series of dicestrous cycles. The report of the Chief Inspector of
Stock for New South Wales divides the time of lambing into six periods, which
embrace the whole year (WALLACE, 1891).

There is, then, a complete gradation from the almost certainly moncestrous
condition of at least some wild species of sheep, in which there is a single sexual
season annually, down to the extreme of polycestrum reached by the Merinos of
New South Wales, which are said to be able to breed throughout the whole year.
The instances cited above have been chosen mainly to illustrate this gradation, to
which I have not seen attention called hitherto.*

That the variability is dependent largely upon climate and food supply can hardly
