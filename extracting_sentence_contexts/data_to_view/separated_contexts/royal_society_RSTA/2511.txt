Thus we continue to retain the result F — C = 4. When we add the next square for the new
row, one labelled 4, we need to be alittle careful. Clearly, we add 3 d.f. to the total, but we actually add three constraints rather
than the 4 we might expect from the fact that we create two new linkages. The point is that one linkage adds two constraints,
but the other linkage is formed by the correct orientation of this new square (as anticipated in the analysis of the rods shown in
figure 2), which means adding just one new constraint. Thus the number of additional degrees of freedom and constraints are
the same, and thus we will retain F — C = 4 for whatever size we now make the structure. (Online version in colour.)
