through are those from red and orange objects, and last from
blue and violet. Now it is evident that transparency in ge-
neral, and this particular fact, are explicable by what was be-
fore laid down. It was found by NewrTox, that a body trans-
mits the light incident on it more or less, according to the
continuity of its particles, and that a strong reflection takes
place on the confines of a vacuum.* How does this happen ?
The initial velocity of light is sufficient to carry it through
the first surface or set of particles, but it is 80 much dimi-
nished, that it is reflected by the repulsive power of the back-
Side of these particles, unless there be others behind at a cer-
tain distance, namely, that at which inflection or attraction
acts, that is, apparent contact; this attraction renews the im-
petus of light, and transmits it to another set, and s0 on.
Now this action being strongest on the largest and red par-
