He
there showed that resting sporangia, which had been kept dry during the winter,
were able to cause the infection of tubers the next season. The distribution of the
organism through the tumour he attributed to its division, when in a condition which
he describes as plasmodial, and to the passage of the segments so produced through
the walls into the adjacent cells. For several years after Porrer’s publication appeared few facts were added to the
existing knowledge of the disease, but in 1907 Bortawick (4) reported that leaves
could be attacked as well as tubers. In the following year, Saumon (42) carried out
a series of infection experiments, from the results of which he concluded that resting
sporangia, after exposure for 12 hours to a temperature ranging from —5° C. to
—6° C., could dispense with the winter dormancy and germinate at once. Shortly
afterwards two notes appeared, one from the pen of JoHNsoN (16) and the other from
that of Wnutss (49).
