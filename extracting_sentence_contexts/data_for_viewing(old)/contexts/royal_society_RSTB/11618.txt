2. Two conceptions of death

As they get older, children growing up in a variety of cultures realize that death
inevitably comes to all living creatures and is an irreversible transformation [1].
The exact age at which they realize those biological facts varies but, barring
cognitive pathology [2], children typically attain those insights by 10 years of
age [3]. More recent research has focused on how children conceive the sequelae
of death. I argue that many children, and adults, are inclined to adopt two par-
allel conceptions of death—a biological conception in which they think of the
deceased as a dead corpse and an afterlife, or religious, conception in which
they think of the deceased as someone who has departed this life but lives

They presented 24 7-year-olds and 24 10-year-olds growing up in Madrid with two
narratives about the death of a grandparent. In one narrative, the death was pre-
sented in a biomedical context. Thus, following the death of the grandparent, a
