STRUCTURE OF A SPECIES OF MILLEPORA. 131

ment of the tentacles, and in the nature of the thread-cells*, MMillepora seems to
resemble 8nch a form as Gemmaria implexa. The real affinities of Millepora amongst
the Hydroids cannot, however, be determined until the mode of reproduction is dis-
covered.

It is a remarkable fact that the corallum of Millepora seems undoubtedly to be gene-
rated by the ectoderm. In Anthozoa this is not the case, the corallum being developed
from a mesoderm, as appears certain in the latest accounts of the matter from M.
Lacazre-Durnrens'sF researches on Astroides calyeularis, and from those of KowaLewsky{
on Astraa and on Aleyonium digitatum. In Alcyonium two elements are recognized by
KowALEWSKY as composing in the embryo the © intermediate layer ” (mesoderm), viz.
a homogeneous membrana propria, which lies internally and penetrates the mesenterial
folds, and a peculiar thin layer of cells, which lies externally to this membrana propria.
1t is from this thin layer of cells that the gelatinous connective tissue, the spicules, and
canal networks are formed. This special layer does not exist in other corals nor in
Cerianthus.

The close resemblance in the histological structure of the coralla formed by animals
