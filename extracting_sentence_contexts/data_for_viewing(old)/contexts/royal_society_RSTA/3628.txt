]. Introduction

Cardiac tissue is a nonlinear excitable medium whose spatio-temporal dynamics exhibits a
complex behaviour ranging from regular to turbulent activity. The first is associated with
plane waves, generated by specific pacemaker cells and travelling through the tissue triggering

a coordinated mechanical contraction of the myocardium. Turbulent activity, instead, arises : =
due to dysfunctions affecting the propagation of the electric pulse and seriously affects the : =
pumping function of the heart, leading to the occurrence of life-threatening diseases, i.e. cardiac [3
arrhythmias. Asynchronous electromechanical activity in the heart is known in the literature : =
as fibrillation. During fibrillation, the regular heart contraction is altered by fast re-entrant DR
waves (spiral or scroll waves) [1-4], which find a very critical substrate in the heterogeneous : a
and anisotropic structure of the cardiac tissue [5]. Spiral and scroll waves can in fact get [a
anchored (pinned) to localized heterogeneities, giving rise to abnormal high-frequency heart : 8
rhythms leading to the aforementioned arrhythmias. For this reason, if not followed by repinning, : S
unpinning is an important step towards successful termination of re-entries. Ne

In this scenario, one of the most challenging goals is controlling the complex dynamics of
the heart under conditions of fibrillation. In clinical practice, the most often used and effective
approach against re-entrant activity in the heart consists of delivering a high-energy electric
shock that excites the entire medium at once and sets all the cells to their refractory state, thus
terminating any electrical activity. Although this defibrillation technique is used routinely, the
delivery of high-energy pulses is associated with undesired side effects that seriously affect the
successful outcome of the therapy [6-8].
