An inspection of the foregoing Tables discloses the fact that, in the case of yapours,
the difference between the sum of the absorptions and the absorption of the sum is, in
general, less than in the case of gases. This resolves itself into the proposition that for
equal lengths, within the limits of these experiments, the sifting power of the gas is
greater than that of the yapour. The reason of this is that the vapours are examined
in a state of tenuity which is only th of that possessed by the gases. Thus, no matter
how powerful the individual molecules may be, their distance asunder renders a thin
layer of them a comparatively open screen.

d 3.

The entrance of a gas into an exhausted yessel is accompanied by the generation
of heat; and the gas thus warmed, if a radiator, will emit the heat generated. Con-
