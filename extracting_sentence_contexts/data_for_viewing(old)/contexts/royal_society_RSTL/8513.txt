a medusal conformation. They are simple sporosacs of a spherical form, supported on
very short peduncles, which spring without any definite arrangement from the sides of
the blastostyles. They show no definite order of arriving at maturity, the more mature
gonophores being sometimes at the distal side of the younger ones, sometimes at their
proximal side, and sometimes scattered among them. Their law of maturation is thus
strikingly different from that of the gonophores of most other hydroids, in which we find
either a constant centripetal or a constant centrifugal order in the periods of their first
appearance and of their arrival at maturity. Â«

Myriothela is also extremely exceptional in carrying on the same hydranth, and even
on the 8ame blastostyle, both male and female gonophores. So far, however, as my
observations extend, the male gonophores are borne at the distal side of the female
ones. No external difference between the two can be detected beyond the fact that the
mature males are much s8maller than the mature females,

In the walls of the mature gonophores (Plate 57. figs. 7, 10, 12), whether male or
female, several distinct structures may be demonstrated. Most externally is a zone of
spherical cells (fig. 12, a), which for the most part contain clear colourless granules; but
towards the summit of the gonophore some of these cells are filled with purplish
pigment granules, and form a coloured circle surrounding the distal pole of the gono-
phore (fig. 14, c, c, 4). Passing from without inwards, this is followed by a zone of -
clavate tissue (fig. 12, 5), and this by the structureless lamella (e) overlaid by muscular
fibrille. These three zones are direct continuations of the corresponding elements in
the ectoderm of the blastostyle.
