In the first place, he does not consider that the statement made in the ‘ Ingolf

plates, holds. #. acutus, at any rate when full grown, can have a few of these spines,
but they are never numerous as in Z. esculentus, and they do not appear at such a
‘young stage. This means that when these spines are found in E£. aeutus they do not
indicate hybridization with FZ. esculentus. Secondly, the suggestion that the two forms are only varieties of one species is ruled
out of court by the facts of distribution. On the Swedish coast L. esculentus alone
is found, but in the more open sea E. acutus also occurs. Similarly, at Port Erin, in
the Irish Sea, and at Millport, in the Clyde, £. eseulentus is found without FZ. acutus.
