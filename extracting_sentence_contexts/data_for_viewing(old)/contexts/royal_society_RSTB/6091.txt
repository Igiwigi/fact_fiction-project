the results of expansion in the prootic region. “ Professor Kingsbury has suggested
that the expansion of the mesoderm occurring coincident with the expansion of the
head may conceivably take two forms—either epithelial or mesenchymal. If the
expansion is epithelial in nature, head-cavities are the result.” (ADELMANN, 1926.)
ADELMANN’S analysis of the growth processes in the prootic region clearly shows that
expansion plays a crucial part in determining the development of the eye-muscle
rudiments and especially of the anterior head-cavity. It is perfectly true that the
facts of eye-muscle development in birds do not immediately suggest the somitic
nature of the rudiments, but it is equally true that in comparative studies the only
sound method of interpretation is to proceed from the lower and simpler forms to
the higher and more complex. Now, it is well known that in the lower vertebrates
the eye-muscle rudiments approach much more closely to the conditions of somites ;
in Cyclostomes, in fact, the metotic somites form a continuous series with the three
prootic somites (Koxtrzorr, 1901; and see also Bracuet, 1921, p. 362). It would
therefore seem that the burden of proof must rest on those who would deny the somitic
nature of the eye-muscle rudiments in the higher forms—a burden which appears never
to have been adequately sustained.

The essential difference between the conditions in Selachians, for example, and
birds is that development is abbreviated in the latter, the eye-muscle rudiments first
arising in a form to which, in Selachians, they have to develop in each ontogeny.
Thus in Scyllium the third prootic somite arises between the trigeminal and facialis
ganglia (GoopricH, 1918), whereas in the duck it arises ventrally to the trigeminal
ganglion, 7.e., nearer to its definitive position. This phenomenon of acceleration is,
of course, familiar enough in development, but it is none the less interesting to find
