Fruits of Trigonocarpon, entire or more or less
decayed, occur abundantly, in the masses, along with the stems and roots of ferns and
other cryptogamic plants and isolated masses of wood of unknown affinity. Lepido-
strobi of various sizes, and apparently in all states of growth, are intermingled with
these ; but we have found no traces of coniferous wood, nor of the fronds of ferns ; the
absence of the latter. may readily be accounted for from the fact of the nodules never
cleaving $0 as to expose flat surfaces of any of the vegetables, and it is difficult to
conceive the delicate fronds of ferns s0 preserved, that their structure should be
recognized on a transverse section of them in a fossil state. The absence of coniferous
wood is not $0 easily accounted for; and coupled with it we may remark, that we
have not hitherto found any tissue at all resembling that which occurs occasionally
abundantly in bituminous coal, and is known as mineral charcoal and mother-coal. In none of the extensive series of sections that we have made and examined is
there any appearance of that longitudinal arrangement of the mineral matter tra-
versed by parallel canals of amber-coloured deposit that is 80 conspicuous in many
good bituminous coals, and which has been considered by some eminent micro-
