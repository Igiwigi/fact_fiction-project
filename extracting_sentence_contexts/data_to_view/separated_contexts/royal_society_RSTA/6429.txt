In general, there
are two canonical geometries whose scattering properties are now generally well-understood:
spheres and idealized (infinitely long) circular cylinders. There has been extensive research attention on wave scattering by spheres since at least the
works of Mie [4], whose thorough outline of the separation of variables solution for the vector
Helmholtz equation continues to influence scientific research well into the present day [1,3]. This
is due to the fact that suspensions of spherical, or approximately spherical, objects arise in an
extensive range of applications, from the homogenization of milk to air pollution modelling. Wave
scattering by infinitely long circular cylinders has likewise received considerable attention, due
to its extensive real-world applications, from the design of fibrous materials such as kevlar to
aerofoil design for aircraft [3]. It would appear that the first comprehensive multipole solution
for scattering by circular cylinders, in the setting of Maxwellâ€™s equations, was conducted by von
Ignatowsky [5], although the first scattering solution was outlined some decades earlier by Lord
Rayleigh [6].
