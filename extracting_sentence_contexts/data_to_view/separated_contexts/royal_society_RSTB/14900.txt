These changes to reef communities
have the potential to significantly alter ecosystem dynamics, possibly even creating novel ecosystems. Potential scenarios where ALAN could create novel ecosystems
include (c) creation of the ‘night light niche’, causing diversity collapse of key reef organisms, interfering with population connectivity and source—sink dynamics,
and disrupting the complex trophic interactions during the diel vertical migration. (Online version in colour.)
