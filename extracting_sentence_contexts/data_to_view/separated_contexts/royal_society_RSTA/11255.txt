Substituting it we find for the correlation
between half-sisters :

The law of ancestral heredity gives for half-sisters r = ‘2, and 2? of this = ‘08. Thus we see that the collateral heredity between half-sisters, daughters of the
same sire, is quite sensible, and is almost what we might have predicted would be
the result, if we supposed correlation to be weakened, as in the previous cases, to
2 of its value by fictitious records. It is worth while to consider the amount of fictitious fecundity suggested by
the reduction factor 3. We have only to suppose the n,/N of our p. 277 to be 3. Now we may well assume the chance of a fictitious fecundity being recorded to be
the same for either one of a pair of sisters ; hence we shall have p = q, and therefore,
from the result on p. 276, we find (p — 1)?/p?=2.
