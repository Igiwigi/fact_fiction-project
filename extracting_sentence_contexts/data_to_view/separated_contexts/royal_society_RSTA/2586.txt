Hence, clinopyroxene does not readily form
phenocrysts suspended in a magma-rich reservoir, and is thus unlikely to erupt: it is essentially
trapped in the mush. Nonetheless, melts extracted from the mush will show a chemical signature
of clinopyroxene crystallization. It is difficult to identify parameters that uniquely discriminate between the different
explanations for the pyroxene paradox, and in fact the paradox might result from a combination
of the different processes discussed above. Nonetheless, three arguments suggest that the mush
explanation is a viable one. First, the Gakkel lavas contain few clinopyroxene phenocrysts despite
the conditions favouring relatively high-pressure fractionation: hence, there must be something
in the magma plumbing system that prevents them from being erupted.
