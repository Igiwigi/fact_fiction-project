primary and not secondary giant cells (see pp. 449, 451), for they are larger; in fact in
one case the lateral cell is the largest cell in the specimen. In the same segment in
which each of these occurs there is only a single giant cell in the median plane, with
which the lateral cell closely corresponds in size (fig. M). As shown above (p. 451),
such lateral cells are to be regarded as members of the couples of their respective
segments, the couple in each case being composed of a lateral and a median giant cell,
