placements. For simplicity's sake, let us suppose for the present the parts of the
forces of restitution depending upon first powers of the displacements to be abso-
lately null. Then, when a molecule is disturbed, its atoms will be acted on by
forces depending upon the second and higher powers of the displacements. These
forces must tend to restore the atoms to their mean positions; otherwise the equi-
librium would be unstable, and the atoms would enter into new combinations, either
with one another, or with the atoms of the surrounding medium ; 80 that, in fact,
such compounds could never be formed. The condition of stability would require the
parts of the forces depending upon $squares of the displacements to vanish, but this
is a point which need not be attended to, all that is essential to bear in mind being,
that we have forces of restitution varying in a higher ratio than the displacements.
Slf the parts of the forces of restitution which depend upon first powers of the dis-
oplacements, though not absolutely null, be very small, the remaining parts must till
She such as to tend to restore the atoms to their positions of equilibrium ; otherwise

Slight, that such compounds would probably never form themselves, but others of
Smore $tability would be formed instead. Or, even were such unstable compounds
'Hormed, they would probably be decomposed on attempting to excite them in the
