Selection for colour obviously cannot
take place directly with leuco-anthocyanins though it may do so indirectly if these
substances are precursors of the flower and fruit pigments. The presence in seeds of
some varieties of Lathyrus odoratus of leuco-anthocyanins, derived from the same antho-
cyanidins as are the anthocyanins in the flowers, may indicate a biological relation
between the leuco- and normal anthocyanins. But this need not imply that the one
is a precursor of the other, and the following points indicate that it is not:

(1) The leuco-anthocyanins are morphologically much more widespread than the
normal anthocyanins; for example, they occur in wood, bark and nutshells as well
as in flowers, leaves and fruits.

(2) In certain cases where both normal and leuco-anthocyanins are present in
the same part of a plant, the normal anthocyanin is not derived from the same
anthocyanidin as the leuco-anthocyanin.

(3) Certain leuco-anthocyanin types, for example, peltogynol (Robinson and
Robinson 1935), have no counterpart in the anthocyanins,

In this latter respect they resemble the flavones and flavonols, and it is perhaps
worth while to draw attention once again to the fact that quercetin (3 : 4â€™-dihydroxy-
benzene nucleus) is the most frequently encountered anthoxanthin.* The antho-
cyanidins obtained from leuco-anthocyanins in the species examined (Robinson and
Robinson 1933, 1934) were as follows:

Pelargonidin in 2 spp. Cyanidin in 42 spp. Petunidin in 1 sp.
