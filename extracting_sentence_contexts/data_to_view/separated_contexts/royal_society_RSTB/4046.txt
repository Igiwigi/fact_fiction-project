This latter
situation accentuates the probability of their having been derived from the fourth
pouch, the primitive connection with the ultimobranchial body having been retained,
and consequently they have moved together with the latter in its forward migration
towards the lateral lobe of the thyroid. This relation to the ultimobranchial body is
the usual one in higher mammals and is possibly facilitated by the absence of a
functional thymus from the fourth pouch. From the foregoing facts we may conclude
that in Phascolomys and Phascolarctos the fourth pouch may develop into an
epithelial body or may, on the other hand, altogether degenerate. EPITHELIAL BODIES, AND THYROID IN THE MARSUPIALIA. 107

The ultimobranchial body at Stage I, Phascolarctos, leaves the pharynx together
with the fifth gill-pouch, which is here less well developed than in Trichosurus
(Stage Ic), and which has quite disappeared by Stage IT, where the body passes back
from the pharynx as a tube with thickened walls, which attains a length of 0Â°24 mm.
at Stage III. At Stage IV it forms a mass of loosely connected cells surrounding a
wide cavity and lying on the dorsal side of the lateral lobe of the thyroid, its ventral
surface being in contact with the latter for a very short distance (fig. 3,wb.).
