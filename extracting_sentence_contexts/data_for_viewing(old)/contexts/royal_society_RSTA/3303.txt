1. Introduction 3
The potential of plant-derived nanoscale cellulosic materials such as cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) : a
has been successfully demonstrated in diverse applications, including responsive membranes [1], 3
bio-based nanocomposites [2] and diagnostics [3]. The exploitation of these biomaterial-based : XS
building blocks has gained high interest not only because of their status as green, lightweight : _
and renewable materials—although these are undoubtedly positive assets—but also due to the 4
fact that nanocellulosic materials possess several inherent features. These include, for example, : =
piezoelectric properties, low thermal conductivity, high thermal stability and low density coupled 3
with relatively high strength as well as the ability to form flexible films that can act as a gas barrier 1S

material [4-7].

Hybrid structures combining organic with inorganic materials are commonplace and many of
the applications, like solar cells, are based on thin-film technology [8]. The use of biopolymers,
however, has remained a largely unexplored area with thin-film hybrids, particularly concerning
plant-based polysaccharides like cellulose. Recently, such structures in which the inorganic layers
are constructed via atomic layer deposition (ALD) have been shown to be able to suppress
thermal conductivity of ZnO when hybridizing it with nanocellulose [9]. ALD thin layers of
Al2O03 have been successfully exploited to enhance the moisture and gas barrier performance of
