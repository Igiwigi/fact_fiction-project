The total current which
must be supplied for this purpose is, as Smrpson* has pointed out, of the order of
1000 ampéres for the whole earth. It is not necessary to suppose that only isolated clouds of the cumulo-nimbus type
contribute to the current between the ground and the upper atmosphere. If we
consider a cloud from which heavy rain is falling and assume that the conditions are
uniform over a large area, the case is in fact somewhat simpler than that of the
cumulo-nimbus cloud ; the general results are the same. We may suppose that a steady condition is reached in which the vertical electric
field within the cloud (and thus the potential difference between its upper and lower
surfaces) has a value which depends on the rate of rainfall and other factors; it is
assumed to be independent of the sign of the polarity. Even if this potential
difference is only yy or yo of that reached in thunder-clouds the effects may be
important: the E.M.F. which tends to drive a current between the ground and the
upper atmosphere is still from 10 to 100 times the normal potential of the upper
atmosphere above fine-weather regions.
