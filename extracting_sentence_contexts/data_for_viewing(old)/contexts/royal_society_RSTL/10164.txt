prone is it to eddying or ious motion. To express this definitely —if py is the

viscosity and p the density of the fluid—for water = diminishes rapidly as the

temperature rises, thus at 5* C. ; is double what it is at 45” C. What I observed was

that the tendency of water to eddy becomes much greater as the temperature rises.
Hence connecting the change in the law of resistance with the birth and
development, of eddies, this discovery limited further search for the standard distance
and standard velocity to the physical properties of the fluid. To follow the line of
this earch would be to enter upon a molecular theory of liquids, and this is beyond my

present purpose. Tt is sufficient here to notice the well known fact that
Þ :

is a quantity of the nature of the product of a distance and a velocity.

It is always difficult to trace the dependance of one idea on another. But it may
be noticed that no idea of dimensional properties as indicated by the dependance of
