k-regular bi-partite Ramanujan graphs.

Why are Ramanujan graphs named after Ramanujan? As far as we know, Ramanujan had no
special interest in graph theory. Let us explain the reason for this name which was coined in [1].

Observe the following power series:

<k —A4(X) < 2h(X) (cf. [3, §4.2]).

A(q) =4 [a - qhyt = Lr(n)q" =q - 24q° + 25243 tees.
n>1
The coefficients t() define the so-called Ramanujan tau function. Ramanujan conjectured that
|t(p) < 2pt/2) for every prime p. The importance of A comes from the fact that if we write
q=e" then A(z) is a cusp form of weight 12 on the upper half plane H={z=x+iy|x,ye
R, y > 0} with respect to the modular group ” = SL2(Z) acting on Hi by Mobius transformation
(25)(z) = (az + b)/(cz +d). Now if Ij(N) = {(04) €I|c=0 mod N} we denote S;(N) (or more
generally S,(N,w) for a Dirichlet character w of Z/NZ) the space of cusp forms on H w.r.t. I(N)
(and w). The Hecke operators T, (p prime, (p, N) = 1), act, and commute, on each S;(N,7w), and
their common eigenfunctions are the Hecke eigenforms. Now, $12(I" = [(1)) is one dimensional


and so A(z) above is such a Hecke eigenform. Moreover, t(p) above is equal to the eigenvalue
of Ty acting on Sj2(I"). A natural and far reaching generalization of the Ramanujan conjecture
mentioned above on the size of t(p) is the so-called Ramanujan—Peterson (RP) conjecture: for
every Hecke eigenform f in S,(N,w), the eigenvalues Ap of Ty, (p,N) =1, satisfy |Ap| < 2pk-V2,
