and because they are learned [6]. However, except for gibbons,
tarsiers, indri and perhaps also marmosets, tamarins and titi
monkeys (see e.g. [86,87]), these complex song-like vocaliza-
tions occur only in birds and non-primate mammals such as
cetaceans, suggesting that they do not share a common evol-
utionary path with music, or any other learned, complex
human acoustic signals like language (but see e.g. [88]).
There are, however, certain similarities and potential instances
of convergent evolution that can provide models for the evol-
ution of human acoustic communication (see [6,89]). Vocal
learning, for example, seems to work in an analogous way in
songbirds and humans, including the prevalence of local dia-
lects and apparent individual differences [90]. In fact, bird
brain areas involved in vocal learning have been compared
to Broca and Wernicke regions of the human brain, as they acti-
vate when a bird hears or sings a song [91,92].

Furthermore, there are interesting parallels between
human music and language and vocal signals of other
animal species, particularly in instances where animal vocali-
zations have semantic- and syntax-like elements (for reviews,
see e.g. [93-95]). Interesting cases of semantic-like elements
(ie. calls that have symbolic functions) come from domestic
chickens, Gallus domesticus. Marler and colleagues [96,97],
for example, showed that food calls produced by males are
