DuTrocter, from an experiment on the
czeum of a fowl, concluded that a rise in the temperature increased both the

rapidity and the quantity of endosmose. In his experiments on acids he even an-
nounces having discovered that the temperature changes the direction of endosmose,
which goes from the water towards the acid, or from the acid towards the water,

according as the thermometer is low or high. At all eyents he does not, generalize
this singular result, which, according to him, belongs only to the acids ; but as a great
many 8aps have an acid reaction, the result onght to be, that, according to the state
of the temperature in those cases, the sap should enter the tree or flow out of it:
this seerns to be in opposition to all known facts. In all the experiments I have tried, and they have been numerous, I have never
been able to ascertain that heat had any apparent influence in promoting endosmose. It is obviously necessary to deduct the effect produced by the dilatation of the liquid
by the caloric, or wait until it has returned to its previous temperature, before mea-
suring its bulk.
