tion, which may amount to X 2 or X 3, lasts for a considerable time—half an hour or
an hour or more—the effect being indeed even more marked and striking than in the
case of nerve. The retina is quite surprisingly resistant, even to strong electrical
currents, far in excess of such as are sufficient to diminish or permanently abolish the
negative response of nerve. The physical conditions appear to be more favourable in
the case of embedded retina than in that of naked nerve to the manifestation of
effects caused by internal products of activity. In my hands the strongest currents
have failed to permanently abolish the retinal response to light, which has at most
been temporarily diminished even by currents with which I sought to effect its
abolition.

The following numbers, and the figs. 28 and 31, will sufficiently illustrate the
facts :-—
