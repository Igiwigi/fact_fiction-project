Stand-
ing in front of the instrument, the direction in the adjacent face of the spiral H'E' was
from right to left, while it was from left to right in HE. From this we may infer that
the polarity of the bismuth cylinders was the reverse of that which would be excited
in cylinders of iron under the same circumstances. The assertion however shall be
transferred from the domain of deduction to that of fact before we conclude. Let us now urge against these experiments all that ever has been urged by the
opponents of diamagnetic polarity. The bismuth cylinders are metallic conductors,
and in moving them through the spirals induced currents more or less powerful may
be excited in these conductors.
