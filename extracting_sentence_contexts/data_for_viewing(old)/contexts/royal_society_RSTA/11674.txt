*S cases, it will be sufficient to leave the links themselves to the imagination, and
& show only the sequence of motions thus OoOo. This movement is that which is
© obtained by the mechanism known as “ parallel cranks,” which is employed in loco-
g motive engines to connect together two pairs of driving wheels by means of an
~p outside coupling rod.

cf Tf the two angles which increase are in sequence, as would be expressed by OOoo
-€ or OooO, or 0000, this movement is that belonging to so-called “ anti-parallel
3 cranks.”

2, If two complete rotations take place at one joint in the time occupied by one at
2 another, or in the time taken by a complete swing to and fro, it will be convenient to
S express that fact by a doubled Q, thus, or by O*.

< Thus the combination of three O’s and one U may be written thus, o0°0U, or

& when reversed thus, Ooc?OU. Considerations of symmetry indicate that the angular

é velocity at the two single O’s must be equal, and therefore, on account of the

< changing magnitude of the angle at the U joint, it will be alternately greater and

g less than half the angular velocity at the fourth joint.

~ As previously described, we may have the movement O0?U U, and also OoUU.
