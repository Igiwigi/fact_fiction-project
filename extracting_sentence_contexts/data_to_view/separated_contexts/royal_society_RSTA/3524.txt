Here, the
planner assumes perfect information of the future and thus the associated (deterministic) solution
may represent an investment option that cannot be efficiently adapted if a different scenario
(which was, in fact, ignored) is realized. This case can also be considered as a base, reference
case:

(c) Illustrative example

(i) Input data

We study the electricity network depicted in figure 2 with three nodes (N1, N2 and N3),
three existing conventional generators (G1, G2 and G3), three existing lines (L12, L13 and L23)
and one load (D). In order to face the forecasted demand growth along a planning horizon
comprising three epochs spanning five years each, the system can be expanded through wind
power generation (W), solar power generation (S), a line (L’23), a FACTS device, namely a quad-
booster phase-shifting transformer (QB) [73], and a battery storage system (B). The input data
used to run our stochastic program are shown in table 2, where base values for power and voltage
are 100 MVA and 66 kV, respectively. For illustration purposes, uncertainty is solely associated with the future evolution of
investment costs of solar power generation.
