It deseends thence in a curve, which is convex upward, to a poi

Running horizontally for the next 2 centims. it turns upward and comes to lie about 2°8 centims. below
the apex of the 12th rib. Thence it sweeps downward gently so that 2 centims. from the mid-vent

below the umbilicus.”

This is a higher position of the border than in the two other estimations of it, and may be due
individual variation, as the plexus on dissection was markedly post-fixed. But against that explanatio
accounting for the entire discrepancy, is the fact that the field for the IlIrd lumbar root, which
determined in the same individual, did not differ much from the estimations in other individuals. It
probable that the full limits of the field of reply were curtailed by the depth of the anwsthesia and th
exhaustion towards the end of the experiment. Ribs, twelve in number each side.
