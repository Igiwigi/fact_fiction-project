But they are not physical, they are pure
gauge modes. There is one further subtlety. We have spontaneous symmetry breaking in a gauge theory, but : 8
it is not, in fact, the local gauge transformations that are spontaneously broken. Indeed, in 1975, Dos
Elitzur [27] showed that spontaneous breaking of a local symmetry is logically impossible. In _
the Coulomb-gauge formalism, our gauge condition has eliminated the local gauge invariance; : Sy
it is broken explicitly, not spontaneously.
