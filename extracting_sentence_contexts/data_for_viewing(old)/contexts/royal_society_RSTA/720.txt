facilitate comparison with the S3T equations and instead study plane Couette flow at Re = 1000 in
a box with respective streamwise and spanwise extents of Ly = 476 and Lz = 476. The turbulent
mean velocity profile obtained from a DNS and a RNL simulation under these conditions is shown
in figure 3a, which illustrates good agreement between the two turbulent mean velocity profiles.
Figure 3b shows the corresponding time-averaged Reynolds stress component, (u'tu'+) 2, where
the streamwise fluctuations, u’, are defined as u! = ut — att ut = u/ur and yt =(y + l)ur/v
with friction velocity u; = /tw/p (where ty is the shear stress at the wall), Rey =u,5/v and v=
1/Re. The friction Reynolds numbers for the DNS data and the RNL simulation are, respectively,
Re, = 66.2 and Re, = 64.9. Although they are not shown here, previous studies have also shown
close agreement between the Reynolds shear stress (i/v’)x, obtained from the RNL simulation
and DNS [19], which is consistent with the fact that the turbulent flows supported by DNS and
the RNL simulation exhibit nearly identical shear at the boundary, as seen in figure 3a. The close
correspondence in the mean profiles in figure 3a, the (Wv"\ xz Reynolds stresses reported in [19], as
well as in the close correspondence values of Re, in the RNL simulations and DNS indicate that
the overall energy dissipation rates per unit mass € = tyU/6, where U/65 is a constant based on
the velocity of the walls U and the half-height of the channel 4, also show close correspondence.
Figure 3b shows that the peak magnitude of the streamwise component of the time-averaged
Reynolds stresses, (u’/+u’+),z, is too high in the RNL simulation. Other second-order statistics,
the premultiplied streamwise and spanwise spectra for this particular flow are presented in [19].
The discrepancies in both (u/tu'*) xz and the streamwise premultiplied spectra are a direct result
of the dynamical restriction that leads to a reduced number of streamwise wave numbers that
