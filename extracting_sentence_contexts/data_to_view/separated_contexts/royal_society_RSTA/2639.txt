The results of two successive experiments are
shown in fig. 37. In each the flame appears to have been somewhat dimmed in
passing through the electric field, but this is solely due to the fact that, in order to
obtain so strong a field, the portion of the explosion tube between the electrodes had
to be surrounded by an oil-bath, fig. 38, the liquid in which absorbed part of the
radiation from the explosion flame. We think the stabilizing influence of the drying
upon the “spin” and detonation thus revealed may be ascribed to the greatly
enhanced radiation from the “ dry ” flame-front which was clearly evidenced by the
greater density of the negative of the resulting photograph under our standard
conditions of development.
