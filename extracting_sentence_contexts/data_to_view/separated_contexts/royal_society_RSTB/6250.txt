in which state the ciliated cells undergo great compression. As the epithelium of the albumen region, in general, ceases secreting, plasma
cells pass through it in great abundance, from spaces beneath the basement mem-
brane. In fact, during the resting phases of the oviduct, plasma cells increase in
number throughout the connective tissue associated with the tubular glands. Close
examination reveals nests of these cells, which are absent when the glands are active
and the connective tissue spaces are diminished. In several instances, plasma cells
have been found between the bases of ciliated epithelial cells (pl, fig.
