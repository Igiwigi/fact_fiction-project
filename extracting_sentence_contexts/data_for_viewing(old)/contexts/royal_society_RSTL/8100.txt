Dteenths of an inch. Tt has four true molars in such lateral series, with relatively smaller
zplaniaries and still smaller sectorial premolars than in Plagiaulax ; the mandibular con-
Zdyle is raised a little aboye the dental line; the carnivorous adaptation of both jaw and
Ztooth i is less marked than in the Purbeck marsupial. But what is the testimony in re-
Zgard to the habits of the existing pouched carnivore no bigger than a rat?

Though magnitude may be, in one sense, a measure of force, it by no means neces-

But whatever bears on the interpretation of the singular dentition of the small © pau-
