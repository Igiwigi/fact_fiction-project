fp of those with planetary systems, the number n, of planets per such system
with conditions suitable for life, the fraction fi of such planets on which life
actually develops, the fraction fi of life-bearing planets on which intelligent life
emerges, the fraction f, of emerged civilizations that develop technologies for
oropagating detectable signals and finally the time span L over which these
civilizations disseminate such signals. Rather than as a product of numbers,
he Drake equation should more appropriately be seen as a product of random
variables with their respective distribution functions [33-35]. Interestingly, the
uncertainty among the different factors in the Drake equation increases from left
o right. The ‘astronomical factors’ R,, f, and n. are rather well determined
as compared with the ‘biological factors’ fi and f,, while the ‘technological
factor’ f; and even more the ‘societal factor’ LZ are the great unknowns.
Despite the fact that the Drake equation has been devised for SETI, only the
ast three factors are specific to intelligent life or its detection by means of
electromagnetic signals, whereas the others are relevant to any astrobiological
context.

Let us suppose that life beyond Earth does exist. In order to detect it,
