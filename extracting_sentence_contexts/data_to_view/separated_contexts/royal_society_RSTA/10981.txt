It will be convenient to consider here what light the new knowledge now acquired
throws upon phenomena previously observed in the course of experiments with
expansion apparatus. ;

All the former measurements which I have published upon the least expansion
required to make condensation take place in presence of ions, are now seen to have
been concerned with negative ions only. One example of interest is the case of nuclei
produced by a zine plate exposed to ultra-violet light. When the plate was negatively
charged, nuclei were found to be present, requiring an expansion, v,/v, = 1Â°25, to make

water condense on them; a fact in agreement with the results of the present investi-
gation, since negative ions were, in this case, plainly in question. The absence of fog
when the expansion was made with the field reversed was, however, as we now see,
no proof that no ions escape from the positively charged plate, for the expansions used
were insufficient to cause water to condense on positive ions had they been present. Another case of interest is that of the nuclei produced by the discharge from a point.
