There is nothing exclusively human-like
about this oldest known archaeological evidenceâ€™ (p. 383). Quite similar statements can be found in the studies of
Davidson & McGrew [25], Joulian [29], Marchant & McGrew
[26] and Wynn [30]. However, other work, relying on the
fact that no great apes appear to have knapped stone as
early hominins did, question such similarities [31-36]. The question is then: does the production of cutting tools
require different skills, and different levels of functional under-
standing than the use of stone hammers to fracture casings of
hard food objects? To the best of our knowledge, no systematic
comparisons of stone-knapping and nut-cracking have been
undertaken.
