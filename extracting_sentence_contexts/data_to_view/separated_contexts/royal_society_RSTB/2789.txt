Instances might be indefinitely extended
among the Ophioglossacese and Ferns to show that leaf-complexity and size are very
variable within near limits of relationship. These suggest that the megaphyllous
character was probably derived from some simpler source, being an extreme and
permanent condition of such variability as we see exemplified in the various phyla. Similarly with the phyllosiphonic arrangement of the vascular tissue, it is open to
any one to hold that this is nothing more than the internal structural expression of
the accomplished fact of a larger leaf-development, and confirmed as a constant in
those plants where large leaf-development is the type. A race originating from a
small-leaved stock, and becoming large-leaved, would in the process undergo conversion
from the one anatomical type to the other. Something of this nature is actually the
case in the young Leptosporangiate Fern, where the stem is protostelic at first, and
only becomes phylosiphonic at a later stage.
