In figure 6, we show the corresponding structural and magnetic
contributions to the whole magnetocaloric peak. In agreement with reported experimental
studies [43], the present results also indicate that the magnetocaloric effect in the vicinity of
the magnetostructural transition is dominated by the structural contribution to the entropy. In
any case, note that, despite the fact that the magnetostructural transition can be induced by
application of pressure, there is no volume contribution to the entropy change.
