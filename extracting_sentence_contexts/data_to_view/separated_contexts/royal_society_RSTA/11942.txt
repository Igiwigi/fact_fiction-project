temperature, 7 is zero; hence the origin of the temperature-scale (7) is also the o
of the scale of tension. But the above equation, unmodified, represents facts with only approxim
accuracy, for reasons which will now be adduced. Let ys and 7 be the axes of the curve AO, showing the relation between ys and
At O, the critical temperature, r = 0, and the value of ys is also 0. With rise of
zie., with fall of temperature, ys increases slowly at first, but soon attains a nea
steady rate of increase, pictured by the nearly straight line CA.
