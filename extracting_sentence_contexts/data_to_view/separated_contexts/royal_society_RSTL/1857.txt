Colonel MoN-
TaGU $tates that he has seen specimens of Gastrockena which had bored into
fluorspar and granite ; but an examination of his specimens in the British Mu-
seum proves that what he regarded as fluorspar are merely crystals of carbo-
nate of lime; and although the shell is not uncommon on the coast of Cornwall
and Guernsey, I have never seen it produce the slightest impression on the gra-
nite rock, eyen in its disintegrated state. Instead of attempting this, the animal
changes its habits, and generally chooses a slight crack in the granite rock, in
which it forms for itself, like some of the fossil species of the genus called


AND ON THE STRUCTURE OF THEIR SHELLS. 803

Fistulana by Lamarck, a calcareous case, partly constructed of 8wch frag-,
menith of $hells or stones as may be thrown within its reach. The granite,
indeed, appears completely to resist all the dissolving powers of the Mollusca,
Thus in some structures, as the Plymouth Breakwater, for instance, in which
limestone and granite are employed together, and placed side by side, the
Patelle form their rounded holes in the former; while they do not in the
slightest degree alter the surface of the latter, except in general by elearing
from off it any calcareous substance which may have previously grown upon
it, I have one specimen beautifully illustrating this latter fact, a young Patella
having aflixed itself to the shelly base remaining from a Barnacle, in which
it has dissolved only the part beneath its foot, leaving the rest forming a ring
around its shell. Many of the boring Mollusca, especially the Lithodomi and Petricole, cover
the hinder part of their shells with a calcareous coat, which is often of a spongy
texture, and differs from the shell in internal structure. This is probably the
dissolved part of the rock again deposited.
