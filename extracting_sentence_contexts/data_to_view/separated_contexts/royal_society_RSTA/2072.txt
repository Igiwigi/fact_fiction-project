We have learned that the upper entropy
plays the role of the potential generating the approach to the reduced pattern R. The upper
entropy is therefore a quantity that comes from the information collected about the way in which
the pattern R is emerging in the phase portrait P. The reducing Legendre transformation is then a
mathematical formulation of the fact that the upper thermodynamic potential #* plays the role of _
the Lyapunov function in the emergence of the pattern R. We still do not know, however, why the ia
reducing time evolution is governed by the gradient dynamics. For statistical origins of gradient D8
dynamics in the principle of large deviations, see [25,26]. :8

(b) Hamiltonian dynamics

In order to enter deeper into the physics of the reduction, we have to turn to mechanics.
