Some of the experiments tried under pressure to study this problem are given in
Table VIIL., details of one experiment being reproduced in Table IX. By a cursory inspection of Table VIII. the two following facts may at once be
deduced :â€”

(1) That in the resistance furnace neither aluminium nor its carbide is produced. (2) That on the other hand all are furnaces give a more or less marked reduction ;
although it will be noticed (in section B) that the product chiefly occurs as carbide of
aluminium. In several cases small malleable lumps of the metal were condensed in the powdered
material surrounding the fused product.
