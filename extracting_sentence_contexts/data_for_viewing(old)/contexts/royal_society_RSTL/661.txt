'= serve for their winter's consumption, having a formation of

S no valve to distinguish the colon, and no fixed course for that
D intestine; 80 that the contents pass along with more facility,

F to prosecute this inquiry with increased ardour, and shall now
E bring forward the facts I have been able to ascertain in con-

S the Society the regular process of the investigation, than to
[E grasp at once at the conclusions, which in the end of it I have
8 felt myself authorized to draw.

I shall therefore begin by stating the circumstances under
which adipocere is formed from animal matter, most nearly
resembling those in which the contents of the lower intestines
in living animals are placed ; and this I shall do from facts,
