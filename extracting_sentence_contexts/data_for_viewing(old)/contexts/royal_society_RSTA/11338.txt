In the present memoir, therefore, are presented the results of an investigation
of the thermal deformation of the orthorhombic normal sulphates of potassium, -
rubidium, and cesium. It is scarcely necessary to remark that the series of these
particular three metals has been chosen throughout the whole of the author’s work
on the relations between the chemical composition of salts and the properties of their
crystals, because of their well-established close relationship, as being in the strictest
sense members of the same family group of the periodic system, the definitely
established and relatively large differences between their atomic weights, and the
fact that they form the most strongly electro-positive series of elements.

Preparation of the Crystals.

Although the new compensation method does not require crystal blocks of greater
thickness than 5 millims., the greatest difficulty has been experienced in obtaining
crystals of the commonest of the three salts, potassium sulphate, of adequate thickness
in all three of the axial directions along which measurements of expansion or con-
