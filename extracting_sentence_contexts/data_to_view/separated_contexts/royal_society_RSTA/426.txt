This ‘plastic pattern’, since it involves local values of 0, 4, y, differs for different points;
moreover it applies, strictly, only to infinitesimal y-increments. On both accounts the

relaxation process may be laborious, but in fact (as in earlier papers) the labour was not
found prohibitive. A use of inexact ‘patterns’ saves time and does no harm provided that exact
account is kept of the ‘residuals’ (Southwell 1946, §170).
