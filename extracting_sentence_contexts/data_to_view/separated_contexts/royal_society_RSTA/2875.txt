Scholars such as Paul Ricoeur and Neil MacCormick understand the law in terms
of speech act theory [18-21], meaning that the force of law depends on the attribution of legal
effect whenever specified legal conditions apply. Such legal effect cannot be understood in terms
of ‘influencing’; it is not a matter of causality. Instead, the legal effect creates ‘institutional facts’,
such as ownership, contract and human rights. Legal effect means that certain acts ‘count as’ or
‘qualify as’, for example, murder or personal data processing. Institutional legal facts are based
on the performative nature of speech acts and notably of legal text.
