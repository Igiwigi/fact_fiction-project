appreciable effect on the calculated amplitude. It is this fact which leads to the result
T have announced in the first paragraph. I will explain how this result did not flow
from my former calculations. The length of the arc s between two tations is

z and m being the amplitude and middle latitude, and «., s the semi-major-axis and
ellipticity. In order to find the effect produced on the dimensions of the ellipse passing
through the two stations by increasing or decreasing the amplitude, this was differen-
tiated, 8 and m being considered constant. This gives an equation connecting da and ds
with dz, the change of the amplitude. A relation was then assumed (in the absence of
a better method) between da and db, viz. that the mean value of @ and Þ is the same in
the two ellipses*. The calculation which I now give rests upon the fact, that the length
of the chord of the arc must be the same in both the ellipses, the local and the mean,
drawn through the stations at the extremities of the arc. 'There was a difficulty in
following this course before, which I have now overcome. T find the length of the are
in terms of the unknown chord and semi-axes, and then differentiate with respect to the
semi-axes, remembering that the chord is constant. All the terms now being small, an
approximate value may be used in them for the chord in terms of either semi-axis and
the observed latitudes of the extremities of the arc,
