For
the latter purpose two methods have been developed: The first depends on measuring
the amplitude of the horizontal movements produced by the various shocks at a
number of points distributed throughout the island. The second method depends on
the fact that the earth movements following the first arrival of the shock at any station
die away more rapidly the closer the focus to the observing station. This decay in
the amplitude of the earth movements with time has been analysed algebraically,
and from the results the relative distances of the different foci from the station can be
estimated. The two methods give results which are in reasonable agreement with one
another.
