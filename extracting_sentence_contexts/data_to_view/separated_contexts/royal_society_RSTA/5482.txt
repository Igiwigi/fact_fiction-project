In a recent work [26], we have shown how the PID performed defining
redundancy as the minimum information contributed by each source to the target [35] ascribes
redundancy to the indirect mechanism R — S— H, the unique cardiorespiratory transfer to
the direct mechanism R > H and synergy to the simultaneous activation of both pathways. According to this interpretation, the dominance of redundancy R{s];4(HF) suggests that in
our data respiratory sinus arrhythmia is mostly due to the baroreflex-mediated mechanism, and
the decrease of both Rispy,7(HF) and Up;7,(HF) with tilt suggests that the cardiorespiratory
interaction is dampened with tilt in parallel with the physiological mechanisms associated with
decreased HRV in this condition; such mechanisms can be of autonomic origin (i.e. related to
parasympathetic withdrawal concomitant with orthostasis [9,13]) or arising from the pacemaker
dynamics of the cardiac system (i.e. related to the increasing mean heart rate which is intrinsically
associated with decreased variability [41]). While the prevalence of baroreflex over central
mechanisms of RSA was observed also in [26], a different interpretation was given to the response
to tilt; we ascribe the difference to the fact that the analysis performed here can be focused
on the HF band, and thus allows us to exclude more safely the strong variations induced by
tilt in the LF band which are otherwise incorporated in non-frequency-specific analyses such as
that in [26].

6. Conclusion

The aim of this study was to introduce a spectral representation of information decomposition
able to quantify, within predefined frequency bands associated with specific oscillatory rhythms,
the unique, redundant and synergistic information shared by two source processes and one target
process describing the activity of a multivariate dynamical system. The proposed framework
was designed building upon long known but not extensively developed relations between
information measures and spectral measures valid for Gaussian systems [31,32]; note that our
analysis can be performed also for processes without joint Gaussian distribution, even though in
this case, the tight relation with information theory is lost and nonlinearities possibly underlying
the measured time series may be missed.
