is a key component of the brainsâ€™ reward system, social
behaviours are promoted and increase in frequency [16].

The VTA is one of the primary producers of dopamine
(DA) in the central nervous system, with the remainder of
DA being produced in the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta
(SNc) [19,20]. The VTA projects to both the mesocortical and
mesolimbic pathways, which in turn enables cognitive and
emotional processes to influence behaviours tied to motivation
and addiction [6,21]. The DA neurons in the VTA have been
found to contain high levels of OXTR in mice, perhaps explain-
ing why OT acting in the VTA promotes social behaviours
and influences the saliency of social stimuli [22]. In fact,
infusion of OT into the VTA causes DA to be released in down-
stream brain regions such as the nucleus accumbens and the
medial prefrontal cortex [17,18].

The DA hypothesis of autism [2] suggests that the
behavioural deficits seen in ASD arise from a dysfunction of
midbrain dopaminergic systems, such as those of the
mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways. Along with the multi-
tude of rodent studies implicating the involvement of OT to
activate DA in these pathways [17,18,22-25], human studies
using fMRI and plasma extractions have offered additional
confirmation [5,26]. It is currently believed that OT can block
