I nays already placed before the Royal Society an account of some experiments which
brought to light the remarkable fact that the body of our atmosphere, that is to say
the mixture of oxygen and nitrogen of which it is composed, is a comparative vacuum
to the calorific rays, its main absorbent constituent being the aqueous vapour which
it contains. Tt is very important that the minds of meteorologists should be set at rest
on this subject—that they should be able to apply, without misgiving, this newly
revealed physical property of aqueous vapour; for it is certain to have numerous and
important applications. I therefore thought it right to commence my investigations
this year with a fresh series of experiments upon atmospheric yapour, and I now have
the honour to lay the results of these experiments before the Royal Society.

Rock-salt is a hygroscopic substance. If we breathe on a polished surface of rock-salt,
the affinity of the substance for the moisture of the breath causes the latter to spread
over it in a film which exhibits brilliantly the colours of thin plates. The zones of
