as that force ceases to act, the joint returns to the former
state. "This is one of the most beautiful instances in nature
of elasticity being employed as a substitute for muscular
action.

The extent of the motion in each particular joint is un-
doubtedly small, but this is compensated by their number, and
the elasticity of the vertebre themselves.

Fish in general have their vertebre formed with similar
concavities to those of the squalus maximus; these, when ex-
amined after \death, contain a solid jelly, but in 'the living
fish it is found in a fluid state. This fact was ascertained
in the skate, the smallness of the quantity of fluid in any one
Joint, and the readiness with which it coagulates after death,
prevented it from: being before observed : the fluid .in the

as far as the small quantity that can be collected admits of
