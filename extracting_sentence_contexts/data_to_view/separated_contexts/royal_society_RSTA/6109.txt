Furthermore, the quadratic coefficient is independent of the
spatial TPC and therefore is independent of a specific material microstructure; the resulting FAM
has demonstrated excellent applicability to different microstructures with contrasting grain size
distributions and grain shapes [36,37]. Most importantly, the applicability extends exceptionally
well to the quasi-static velocity limit. This is further supported by the fact that the quadratic
coefficient q of 73/2 obtained in our prior work [36] is essentially the same as that from the
quasi-static SC fit in table 3 for cubic materials with Ad > 1. In this work, we determine the quadratic coefficient of the FAM differently by obtaining it
from the SC model fit of the quasi-static velocity results. We have extended the FAM to other
symmetries, for which the quadratic coefficient q in equations (5.1) and (5.2) is taken from the
quasi-static SC fits in table 3.
