has been determined as carefully as the conditions permit, and the
increments during the sixth and seventh years have been 0-75 and 0-5 per cent. respec-
tively. That some part of this increase is due to the inability of sunlight to affect the
lower-seated tissues, appears certain from the fact that mossing or otherwise shielding the
bark has a less effect in increasing the amount of alkaloids in the older bark than in the
thin bark of younger trees. There is every reason to think that the alkaloids will
increase by annually diminishing amounts until the amount formed is only equivalent
to the destructive influences at work. The growth of the liber and the formation of
woody cells, for the reasons given above, is advyerse to the increase of yield of alkaloids.
