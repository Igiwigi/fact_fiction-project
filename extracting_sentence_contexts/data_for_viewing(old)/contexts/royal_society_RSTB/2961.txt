only one row to the descending lamella, about one-third of the way up, but the
ascending lamella may have one, two or three rows.

The lateral cilia are situated at some distance from the frontal edge, and in Arca
granosa the frontal cilia extend round so as to cover part of the anterior and pos-
terior faces of the filaments (fig. 3E, p. 164). Some cilia occur on the interlamellar
side of the filament. The thickest part of the chitin lies close to the interlamellar
edge of the filament (fig. 3E) ; in Arca americana it is very pronounced, especially
in the higher parts of the filaments (fig. 10B).

Datu (18, p. 435) speaks of Arca ectocomata as having gills with descending
filaments only, and as differing in this respect from Arca now. This may be so, but
it is just possible, judging by the fact that he speaks of the filaments as much
“ gontorted in all directions, twisted and curled,” that this is a species without inter-
lamellar septa, like Arca tetragona, for instance, and that the ascending parts of the
filaments have fallen down, as in badly preserved specimens of the latter species
they are very liable to do.

The isolated filaments of Pectunculus glycimeris bear a close resemblance to those
of Arca tetragona (fig. 10C), except that the large ciliated disc at the lower angle is
wanting. There are fifteen or sixteen ciliated discs on each side of the ascending
filament, and the same number on the descending. There are no interlamellar septa ;
the upper ends of the ascending filaments are in ciliary connection only, and the
upper edges of the ascending lamellz are not united with adjacent parts of the body.
The filaments are broad and thin (fig. 11A); an intrafilamentar septum is present,
