But it may be remarkable that, of three groups showing a con-
siderable deficiency of sinistral broods, two should have come from Colne pairings,
though there is (below, p. 103) no similar deficiency in the F; groups derived
from pairing Colne wilds with E dextrals. The facts are suspicious, but it is
impossible to be sure that they indicate anything definite. The results described
below (p. 99) may also support the suggestion that Colne wilds are different
from the others. Of the 340 F broods, 234 came from pigmented and 106 from albino parents.
