bodies. M. Lecocg DE BOISBAUDRAN states that iridium points give no lines
belonging to that metal, but this statement does not apply to photographed spectra
of rays of high refrangibility obtained with a condensed spark, since about 180 lines
have been counted in 8uch a spectram. Of all metals affording materials for
electrodes gold appears to be the best ; its spectrum is a weak one, containing
comparatively few lines, it is an excellent conductor of electricity, and it is not
attacked by solutions of metallic chlorides.

There is no very simple method of obtaining spectra free from air lines without
resorting to either an inconveniently short or a too prolonged exposure, and if such
existed ib would be of doubtful advantage, since the number of the air lines in the
ultra-violet region is not exceedingly large, and from their character they are easily
recognisable. They are, in fact, a positive advantage, since by their well known
appearance and positions they serve to fix the position of other lines. A simple and
elegant apparatus devised by my colleague, Professor O'ReiLLY, consists of a metallic
wick composed of a few twists of platinum wire, by which a Buxsex flame is fed with
the solution to be examined. Wicks of gold wire have been used by me, the metal
projecting about one-eighth of an inch above the surface of the s0lution.

Of all elementary substances hitherto photographed, graphite yields the simplest
spectrum (* Note on Certain Photographs of the Ultra-Violet Spectra of Elementary
Bodies,‚Äù Journal of the Chemical Society, vol. xli., p. 90). It shows lines and the
edges of bands due to the air-spectrum to the number of sixty-six, of rays assignable
to carbon it contains but twelve. Graphite being an excellent conductor of electricity,
electrodes are made in the simplest possible manner by cutting plates of good Ceylon
