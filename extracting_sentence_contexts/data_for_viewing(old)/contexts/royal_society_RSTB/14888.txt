(ii) Diversity among LK landscapes with L = 3 and K=1

How much does the population-size dependence of i depend
on the specific landscape considered? To address this question,
we focus on landscapes that have more than one peak (46% of
L=3, K=1 landscapes), since with a single peak, hi is always
equal to the fitness of that peak. Interestingly, figure 1b
shows that ft does not always monotonically increase with N.
In fact, this expected case occurs only for about 40% of the
landscapes with more than one peak (e.g. figure 1c), and h

So far, we have considered the average /i of h over all possible vice-versa for landscapes displaying overall decreasing beha-

those with high fitness? This question is relevant to adap- 75.2% of two-peak landscapes), yield an overall increasing
