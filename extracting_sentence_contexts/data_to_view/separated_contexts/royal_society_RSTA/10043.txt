R. BOUSFIELD: IONIC SIZE IN RELATION TO

ionic sizes upon rates of transference would theoretically lead to the result that the
reciprocals of the Hittorf migration numbers should be expressible as a linear
function of the ratio of the radions. This turns out in fact to be the case, and we
incidentally arrive at a useful method of extrapolation to determine the value of the
Hittorf number for an electrolyte at “ infinite” dilution. These considerations enable us to determine the coefficients B for the separate ions
in the expressions for the radions, These coefficients B we refer to as the “ hydration
numbers,” the relation between the hydration numbers and the migration numbers at
infinite dilution being of the form

B = B,N, + B.N;.

_ Turning now to a consideration of the viscosities of the KCl and NaCl solutions, it

is shown that the viscosity of these solutions can be represented approximately as a
linear function of the radions, as can also the viscosity of mixtures of normal KCl and
NaCl solutions. Passing to a consideration of the general relation of viscosity to ionic size, the
extended conception of the radion is introduced, and an approximate value is given to
the radion of water, which expresses the average radius of the water molecules
reckoned upon the same scale as the radions of the solute.
