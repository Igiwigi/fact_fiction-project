The formule given by these observers were

vy = 41223-86 —125229n-* —1377549n-'; (Diffuse series) Ay, = 172-07; Avy = 129-14;

v = 41222-15 —119890n-* —580770n-*; (Sharp series) Ay, = 173-78; Avo = 129°14;

An attempt has been made to extend these series, but a considerable difficulty arose
from the fact that the manganese spectrum is very rich in lines and that such expected
triplets would probably be very faint. Additional triplets, however, have been
recognised, as shown in Table I.

Sharp series, 1\p—ms.—The first two triplets of this series were traced by Kayser
and Runer. The observations of JanicKrt on the structure of the manganese lines
show the lines of the first triplet to be quite simple and sharp (see Plate 1, fig. 5).
