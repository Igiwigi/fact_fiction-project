factor mRNA in the hippocampus and, similar to the antidepressant drug venlafaxine, increased
the norepinephrine concentration in the prefrontal cortex in the rat brain [84]. Transcutaneous
VNS also elicited far field potentials from the brainstem [85], as well as inducing production
of IL-1f in the brain and activating the hypothalamic-pituitaryâ€”adrenal axis [86]. In healthy
subjects, VNS shifts the high-frequency power density of heartbeat dynamics, also inducing a
partial cardiorespiratory decoupling [87].

VNS, together with rehabilitative therapy, also enhances functional motor recovery after
traumatic brain injury in animals [88]. VNS activates neuronal and astrocytes a7nAchR, and
inhibits the apoptosis and oxidant stress responses possibly associated with increased Akt
phosphorylation and miR210 expression [89].

VNS has also been linked to cardiac diseases [90-92]. These diseases, in fact, still have
a high mortality rate owing to neurohormonal activation and autonomic imbalance with
increase in sympathetic activity and withdrawal of vagal activity. VNS could be a viable
solution to counteract the sympathetic tone and enhance the vagal tone, with applications for
heart failure, atrial fibrillation and coronary heart disease induced by increased sympathetic
nerve activity [90,91,93]. The improvement in heart failure and the anti-inflammatory and
vasodilatory properties of VNS provide additional antiarrhythmic benefit [94]. VNS, in fact, acts
on proinflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide elaboration and myocardial expression of gap junction
proteins [95,96].
