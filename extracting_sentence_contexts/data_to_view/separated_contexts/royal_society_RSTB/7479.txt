As Government officials
Sp brought natives as constabulary or carriers from those regions where kuku was the
el term for tobacco, the latter may have used the word for the local native tobacco as
= they certainly did for the trade tobacco they brought with them. It was in this manner
= also that our word tobacco, with its minor variants, was very recently introduced into
eS these remote areas.

& The numerous unrelated names for tobacco among the central mountain short
3 people afford an argument for those who regard tobacco as having been smoked by
Es these peoples before the arrival of Europeans. Against this view must be urged what
2 seems to be an established fact, that the only tobacco grown and smoked in New
a Guinea is the American species Nicotiana tabacum. This is discussed in part III.

= I omit here any mention of the native names for pipes, as in a number of cases they
Eg are merely the word for bamboo, and it may well be the same in other cases. There are
scl numerous examples of an object being named after the material of which it is
& made.
