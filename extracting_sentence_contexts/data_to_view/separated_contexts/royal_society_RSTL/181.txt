is easIly transformed, in functions of a, x, a, the x is now real,
and the part involving a will always be of the form f(a" +a),
and therefore readily expressed in trigonometrical functions. Before we proceed farther, it will be necessary to premise
a transformation of CorTEs's formula, which we $hall have oc-
casion to make use of. It is as follows :
