35. This is not only applicable to discharges produced by different quantities dis-
posed on the same conductor, but it is also true in disposing the same quantity on
many conduetors precisely similar, 80 as to double, treble, &c., the extent of similar
snrface : we bave in all cases the distance of discharge, in a simple ratio of the quan-
tity contained on a unit of similar surface.

36. The distance, therefore, through which an electrical accumulation can discharge
in air of a given density, is an accurate measure of the comparative quantity contained

* I do not advert to these experiments as containing any very new or unexpected results in electricity, but
in explanation of the application of particular methods of research, in demonstrating more completely than has
been hitherto done, a class of facts essentially involved in the subject of these inquiries,


INFLUENCE OF AN INTERPOSED CIRCUIT ON THE QUANTITY TRANSMITTED. 227

in an unit of space, or (supposing the electrical particles to repel each other) of the ten-
sion ; now the attractive force evinced by the electrometer, and which we have termed
intensity, is directly as the $quare of the quantity contained in a unit of space, an
cannot be taken as a measure of the tension, except under this condition.

37. On reviewing these phenomena, as connected with the discharge of electricity
between conductors, we may trace an interesting and consistent relation hetween them.
If we call the force exerted between two points c Â©, fig. 14, at the instant of a dis-
