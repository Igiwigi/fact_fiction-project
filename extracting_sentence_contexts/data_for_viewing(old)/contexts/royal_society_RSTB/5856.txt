building up of a new embryonic region without the aid of a normal organisation centre.
These influences, which have been unaltered by the experiment, are then exhibiting
greater potentialities than they are called upon to exert in the normal course of events.
There are no grounds for supposing that the unaided primitive streak, in normal
development, induces the medullary plate from non-presumptive ectoderm, since
under normal conditions it is aided by the material movements, which have been
initiated at an earlier stage. Even if the transverse movements of material are originally
initiated by the primitive streak, this does not affect the argument given above which
applies to the organising capacity of the primitive streak of later stages, from which
the inducing grafts were made. Similarly, it is clear that the transverse material
movements themselves do not in normal development give rise to the axial region of
the embryo, since they are in fact added by the primitive streak, which has been built
up by the longitudinal movements of a still earlier stage.

GENERAL Discussion.

As was stated in the Introduction, the previous experimental work on the development
of the chick has been largely confined to a study of self-differentiation. Oxtvo (1928)
has described the self-differentiation of heart muscle explanted into. tissue culture from
young blastoderms. The most important previous work in this field is probably that
of Hoapiry (1926a, b, 1927), who has published a series of papers on the self-differentia-
tion of various parts of the blastoderm, transplanted at various ages to the chorio-
allantoic membrane of older chicks. His results make it clear that the various regions
of the blastoderm are, even in very early stages of development, no longer indifferent
