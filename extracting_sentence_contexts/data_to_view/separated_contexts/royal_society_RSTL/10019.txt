His firsb experiments on the snbject were made with the ordinary
porous cells of batteries. Similar results were obtained by the investigation of non-
living vegetable structures, as e.g., laminaria stems. By comparing these facts with
those already stated as to the electrical phenomena observed in the investigation of
leaves, he derived the conclusion that whatever differences present themselves between
the different parts of leaves are due to © Unterschied im der Benetzbarkeit” of the
-gurfaces led off, What the direction of this effect is, KUNKEL had determined by
experiment, If a drop of water is placed on the green surface of a leaf between the
veins and allowed to remain there some time and the leaf is now led off by another
similar 8urface and by the drop, it is found that the surface first wetted is always
positive to the other (p. 368). If after one electrode has been brought into contact
with an ordinary surface, the other is applied to a vein, the direction of the difference
is opposed to the normal.
