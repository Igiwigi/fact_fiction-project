Secondly, the histology and distribution of the nervous elements of Lange’s nerve
require further study. Thirdly, the apical motor system discovered by Cusénor in
Marthasterias glacialis, Asterias tenuispina, Echinaster sepositus, and Astropecten aurantiacus
has been shown by Meyer (1906) not to be present in Asterias rubens. In view of
this fact, the presence of a separate apical system in the asteroids would appear to
be a matter of doubt. Moreover, even if an apical system be present in some or all
of the Asteroidea, its connexions with other parts of the motor system or with the
sensory system require to be demonstrated. Finally, the histology of the ectoneural
system, although described in great detail in Mevyer’s excellent account, needs
verification in some particulars.
