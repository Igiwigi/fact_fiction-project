out of FKBP5 in mice did not alter anxiety-like behaviour
under basal [36] and stress conditions [72,80], selectively
reducing FKBP51 in the amygdala with viral vectors reduces
stress-induced anxiety-like behaviours in mice [75]. Similarly,
pharmacological disruption of FKBP51 signalling locally in
the amygdala also produces an anxiolytic effect [69]. In support
of this, viral-mediated overexpression of FKBP51 in
the basolateral or central amygdala enhanced anxiety-like
behaviour [69]. In contrast, anxiety was not altered by overex-
pressing FKBP51 in the dorsal hippocampus of mice [69] or
by knocking down FKBP% in the prelimbic cortex of rats [76].
The region-specific influence of FKBP51 in the amygdala is criti-
cal for anxiety regulation. In fact, stress-related mechanisms
have also been shown to modulate FKBP51 in the amygdala.
One study found that chronic stress increases amygdalar
FKBP51 in mice through a mechanism involving neuropsin-
mediated cleavage of the tyrosine receptor kinase, EphB2 [75].
A more recent study found that microRNA-15a_ inhibits
