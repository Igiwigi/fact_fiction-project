Moreover, it
will suggest the definition for directed graphs (digraphs)
and even high-dimensional simplicial complexes (the so-
called Ramanujan complexes), as will be explained in §3
and in §4. Ramanujan graphs have found plenty of applications
in computer science and pure mathematics. Most of
them have to do with the fact that they provide optimal
expanders (see [2-4] and the references therein). Lately,
Ramanujan complexes and high-dimensional expanders
have also started to be a popular subject of research
(cf. [5,6] and references therein). THE ROYAL SO C IETY © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.
