inch, and with only a small divergence at 5000 Ibs. per sq. inch. The results in fact
go to show that the law of retardation is linear as regards stress not only up to the
elastic limit but actually to at least twice this range, where it is quite impossible for
the strain to be linear. This result is shown in all the experiments on good optical
material. Thus in plates $ inch thick where the elastic limit appears to be about
2250 Ibs. per sq. inch, fig. 8, the corresponding value for f/f, shows no divergence from
linearity until nearly double this amount, although the curve of f,/e ceases to be
linear at about 2500 pounds per sq. inch.
