The case h=0: As an aside, we note that the case h = 0 is of course dramatically different. Indeed

one can show that

2 (n+kh

Jim, zi DY afr= ("i “4 ') (1.18)
feMn

is a polynomial of degree k? — 1 in n, rather than degree 2(k — 1) for non-zero shifts.
Our method in fact gives the more general result:

Theorem 1.2. Let k = (ki,...,ks) be a tuple of positive integers and h = (hy,...,hs) a tuple of distinct
polynomials in Fg[t]. We let

Dy(njh) = > dy, (f +n) dy, (f + hs).
fEMn

Then, for fixed n > 1,
1 : - (n+k;-1 1/2
