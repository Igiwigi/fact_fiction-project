The presence of an anodic make contraction speaks in its fayour, since, given
= the axiom of PrLiuGer and Crauveau, that make contraction is kathodic, break
= contraction anodic, it follows that with anodic make there coexists an associated

2 kathodic make. 5 (2.) The elementary fact that, over certain points of nerve, the museles that contract

-2 at anodic make are not the same as those that contract at anodic break also s8peaks in
2 its favour, since ib indicates that ab the two events the points of excitation are not

identical. = To denote the nerye-regions that are subjected to the two kinds of influence, we

2 use the terms © polar” and © peripolar.” The area of electrical influence within which
= the density is sufhcient to produce physiological effect is schematically represented as
EZ consisting of a polar region immediately beneath the electrode, in which the electrical
= relation is of the same sign as that, of the electrode, and of a surronnding peripolar
-Z region in which the electrical relation is of the opposite sign (Diagram I.).
