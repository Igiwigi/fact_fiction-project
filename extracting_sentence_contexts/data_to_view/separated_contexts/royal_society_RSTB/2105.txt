Another peculiarity in the enamel development of the Gadide is that, after the
transformation of the ameloblasts into the stroma, there are no conspicuous cells to
which can be assigned the function of separating out the lime salts, a function which
is apparently discharged by the ameloblasts in mammalian tooth germs. Immediately outside the stroma and in the walls of the tooth sac is an abundant
plexus of vessels, which thus lie practically in contact with the stroma, but they do
not enter it, nor are there any large cells in relation with these vessels, so that one
is driven to the conclusion that, the stroma once formed, it is able to draw into itself
the required lime salts, and to deposit them at that point which is farthest from
the vessels,

This deposition of lime salts at the points most distant from the vessels, and even
at a little distance from cells, is not, however, unusual, for as has been pointed out by
Professor Sims Woodhead (15), this is exactly what generally takes place in calcifica-
tions elsewhere. And it is what happens, though at a point much less remote, in the
calcification of a mammalian ameloblast, which undergoes calcification at its distal
extremity, these cells being themselves yet further separated from the vessels by the
interposition of the cells of the stratum intermedium and of the external epithelium
of the enamel organ,

42 MR. C. 8S. TOMES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE

To revert to the rods or tubes which have been described and figured (figs. 5, 8), it
seems hardly possible to doubt that they bear some relation to the forming prisms, and
are a stage in their development, and the fact that they are not to be distinguished in
that portion of the enamel stroma which lies close to the dentine tends to bear out
this view. For it is to be remembered that the marked striation of the finished
enamel, whether it be due to tubes or to very distinct prisms, does not exist in the
inner portions which lie close to the dentine; this may be better seen in the thick
enamel of Sargus than in the comparatively scanty enamel of the Gadidw, though
it is true of both alike. But whether the appearances figured are sections of solid rods or of tubes remains
uncertain.
