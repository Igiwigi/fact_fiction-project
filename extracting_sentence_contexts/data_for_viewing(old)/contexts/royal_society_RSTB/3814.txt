reverse of that which we should expect if the Abietinese are the more ancient.
When considered from all standpoints, the evidence presented by the pitting
decidedly favours the greater age and direct Cordaitean connection of the
Araucarine.

As in pitting, so in medullary ray structure, Woodworthia does not differ in any
essential feature from the Cordaitales. The ray cells are thin-walled in both, and
unpitted on the horizontal and terminal walls as well. Araucariopitys has, on the
other hand, thick-walled and pitted medullary ray cells, “as is typically the case in
the Abietinez.”

Besides the pitting and medullary ray structure being more Cordaitean in the
older form reference has been made above to the fact that, according to JerrREy’s
view, the traumatic resin canals should be better developed here also, whereas they
are apparently absent (not reported) in Woodworthia, but are well developed in
Araucariopitys. In connection with this feature the writer would call attention to
the many evidences of traumatic resin canals in the oldest fossil representatives of the
Abietinere. Conwentz (1890) in his monograph on the Amber pines (Pinus
succinifera) devotes considerable space to it and figures one traumatic series with 13
canals in it. He considers that wounding was much more prevalent in that period
than it is to-day. In many of the Pityoxyla of the Cretaceous there are traumatically
arranged, though not so extensive, series of resin canals. SEwARD (1896, p. 422),
in describing Pinites Ruffordi from the English Wealden, says that “the usually
large number of resin canals in certain parts of the section may be regarded as an
expression of some injury sustained by the tree.” GorHan speaks of the abundant
