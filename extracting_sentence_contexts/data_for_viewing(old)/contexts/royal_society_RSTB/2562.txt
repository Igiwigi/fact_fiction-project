in the axil of the first sheath. Whether this would be the normal process, or whether
the growth would be to the bud in the axil of the same leaf, cannot be determined.
If this is the function of these hyphze in the leaf-base, distance would probably be an
important determining factor of the course in growth.

It is also conceivable that the tendency to form patches of hyphze in the leaf-base
is associated with the habit of entering the carpels previous to the infection of the
ovules. As described later, the hyphee can be found in the bases of all morphological
equivalents of leaves, 7.¢., paleze, glumes and stamens.

Again, it might be considered that the hyphz are led—probably by chemotactic
attraction—into the young leaf rudiments as into a growing point, but the absence of
the fungus from all roots, and particularly from lateral roots, points to the fact that
adaptation is very highly developed.

In general the hyphze are not found in the vascular bundles, and seldom even in
close proximity to them, but are abundant in the thin-walled parenchyma. They
are more easily seen here than in the embryo on account of the less dense protoplas-
mic contents and the frequent shrinking of the walls of the host-cells. They are
usually, however, just as closely compressed by the surrounding walls as they are in
the embryo.

The hyphe, as seen in the leaf-bases (figs, 19-21), have a finely granular protoplasm
in which a high power shows numerous large vascuoles, which are, however, absent from
some regions (fig. 20). The nuclei are ellipsoidal or spheroidal, with a well-marked
