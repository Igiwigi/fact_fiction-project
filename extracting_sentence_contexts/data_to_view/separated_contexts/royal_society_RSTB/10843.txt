Our recent paper [3] contained
a critique of certain aspects of two recent papers they published [4] and [5]. We
believe this critique was important, because we believe the interpretations they
provided sometimes lacked adequate engagement with existing research on peat-
land fire ecology, had the potential for damaging misinterpretation, and
occasionally appeared to have an unintentional lack of balance. In the case of
Brown et al. [4], this concern was exacerbated by the fact it was a review paper
and such publications aim to provide an authoritative overview of knowledge
in a certain area. We believe there were several respects in which that standard
was not met. We also critiqued media outreach and coverage associated with
their papers and, in the case of Brown et al. [3], the publication protocol associated
with a research report they issued [6].
