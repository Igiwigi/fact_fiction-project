If we had adopted any of the other forms for the energy, which involved the fifth-
order terms with a negative sign, an exactly opposite result would have been arrived at.
Hence, it is that we adopted the form

@g = — wPyr-* + Buta? Pars’,

and

So far we have applied only qualitative tests. Quantitative tests are postponed to
the third chapter.

[5] Plate cut parallel to the face of an octahedron—We start with the experimental
fact :—‘‘ The amplitude of the waves of S$, reaches a small maximum in small fields
and vanishes in stronger fields almost completely.”* It will be shown now that the
present theory bears out this result.

The eight faces of an octahedron formed from a cubic structure have for their normals
(41/V3, £1//3, + 1/173) as direction cosines. Consider, in particular, the face
whose normal is (1/+/3, 1/3, 1/+/3). Clearly if (a, », v) be any vector in the plane
of the disc

A+ pty =o.
Now, H is applied in the plane of the disc, and in virtue of the symmetry I also lies
in the plane. Hence
U+m' +n' =0, l+m+n=0.
