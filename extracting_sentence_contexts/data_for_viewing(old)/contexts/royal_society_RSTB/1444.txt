also illustrates the point (see Plate 73, photographs 7, 8, and 9). At a di
from its base the branch has a large fistular pith, surrounded by a ring of
24 bundles, of the normal structure (photograph 7). Lower down the pith is
smaller; the bundles are still normal, but are much reduced in number (photogr
which shows 14 bundles), At the base itself the pith is reduced to a minute

So far as we have gone, the structure of the branches in their basal region
