So far we have been dealing with the case of a symmetrical aerofoil at zero incidence, which
is of interest only in giving the magnitude of wave drag for this case. Before proceeding to
the detailed consideration of this drag it will be advantageous to consider the extension of
our methods, necessary to deal with the antisymmetrical case, from which the lift on a thin
aerofoil at incidence may be calculated.

Mathematically the simplicity of the zero incidence case arises from the fact that 04/dy
can be specified over the plane in which the aerofoil lies. When we take the Laplace trans-
form, then in the consequent two-dimensional equation for ¢, 04/dy is known along the whole
of the x-axis. Thus, when we represent ¢ by a Fourier integral, the consequent integral
equation to determine the coefficients is an easy one, involving only the inversion of the
Fourier integral. In the case of incidence circumstances are entirely different, for now we
have no knowledge of 0¢/dy except at the aerofoil surface. To illustrate the difficulties involved
we shall consider briefly an important special case—that ofa flat plate aerofoil of rectangular
plan, set at incidence in a supersonic stream, with its leading edge normal to the stream.
For the theoretical treatment we suppose the chord of the aerofoil to be infinite. It is clear
that, if the trailing edge is parallel to the leading edge for any actual case, then the pressures
on the wing are the same as they would be for an infinitely extended aerofoil.
