formed by superglacial rivers, but that view appears to have no supporters for Irish
eskers, As Prof. Sotias (1896, p. 819) observed, the structure of the Irish eskers
shows that they were deposited where they are now found, and that they were not
precipitated in mass by the sinking of the floor of a glacial canyon. Mr. W. B.
Wricur (1914, p. 39) remarks that the bedding is “ frequently quite undisturbed.”
The levels are inconsistent with the river theory as advocated for Ireland, for if the
canyons had been cut through the ice to the ground, the rivers could not have flowed
in an opposite direction to the slope of the land.

It has been pointed out, as by Newperry (1878, p. 41), that some of the American
eskers occupy “a topographical position, which makes it impossible that they should
ever have been the beds of rivers,” as they cross or even lie along the divides. The
fact that the Irish eskers are independent of the slope of the country is fatal to the
view that they were deposited in rivers flowing through open glacial canyons.

Observed variations in level would, on the other hand, naturally occur in marginal
deposits along the edge of an ice sheet resting on an undulating surface.

3. Esker Structures not Fluviatile.

That the river drift theory does not explain all, or even most, of the Irish eskers is
shown by their structures. Glacial rivers, such as those assumed for the formation of
eskers, are naturally shallow and rapid; and in them the coarsest material should
collect in the centre of the channel, while fine silts would be deposited only in the
quieter water beside the banks; but in many Irish eskers the reverse is the case.
