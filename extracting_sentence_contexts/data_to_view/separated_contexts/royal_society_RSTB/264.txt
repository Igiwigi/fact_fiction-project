Moreover, the fine processes of the
spherule-bearing sacs were described by Perrter as joining the wall of the sacculus ;
they exhibit no amoeboid movement, and are not in the least suggestive of flagella. But the strongest argument of all against this part of Vor and Yuneâ€™s theory is
the fact that during life the contents of the sacculi are absolutely colourless, which is
entirely inconsistent with the statement that they are algoid zoospores. Yet this
fact should have been well known, since it has been frequently mentioned (21, p. 527.;
6, p. 127 ; 18, p. 67). (3.) It is impossible absolutely to prove that the yellow-cells and sacculi have no
connection with one another ; but their extremely different appearance in the living
animal and the entire absence, so far at least as my observations go, of any inter-
mediate structures between them render such a connection so highly improbable,
that the onus of proof must rest with Messrs. Voet and Yuna.
