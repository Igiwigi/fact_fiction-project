To explore this, we measured the temperature on the surface of microcoils
during repetitive magnetic stimulation at the strongest current level (718 mA; see Materials and
Methods). The average maximum temperature increases were less than 0.5°C (not shown), well
below the threshold for thermal activation of neurons (greater than 43°C) [52,53] and the threshold
for thermal damage to neurons (greater than 60°C) [54]. The relatively small increase in coil
temperature may be due to the fact that the coil has a very low DC resistance compared to
the electrode (e.g. 0.76 Q for microcoils versus 0.4-1 MQ for electrodes), so even with the high
current levels the power dissipation in the coil does not increase significantly. We estimated that
the energy per pulse for a magnetic waveform with an amplitude of 200-500 mA is 3-19 pJ, which
is comparable to that of deep brain stimulation (0.8-10 pJ) [63] and cortical surface electrodes
(2.59 pJ) [1]. Although further studies on the effects of coil heating are necessary, our results and
estimation suggest that the high levels of current (200-500 mA) flowing in the coils with a very
low resistance (less than 1 2) may not induce significant temperature changes in the neural tissue.
