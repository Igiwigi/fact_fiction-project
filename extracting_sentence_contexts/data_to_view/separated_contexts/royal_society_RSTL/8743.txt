The
structure of the hard tisxue of eliopora is, however, in many respects very like that
of the sclerites of Primnoa. Blue Coloration of the Corallum. The corallum of eliopor is coloured of a deep blue, and has always been regarded
as remarkable amongst corals for this fact. Now that it is known to be an Aleyonarian
structure the fact is less exceptional, since both Corallium and Tubipora have a deeply
coloured corallum, and many other Alcyonarians have coloured spicules. Amongst Hexac-
tinians Stylasterf ro80ceus is of an intense red, and the corallum of some Fungias is also
red; also that of certain Eupsammide, but amongst these the condition is exceptional,

The blue tint is seen in sections of the corallum to be diffused within the hard tissue.
