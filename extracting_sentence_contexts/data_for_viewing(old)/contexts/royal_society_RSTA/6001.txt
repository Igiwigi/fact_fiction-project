5. Correlation

We have seen that the steps of the walker have three possible values. Therefore, we need to
analyse the time series for such a walk. Let the step taken at a time t be written as s(t) =0, +1.
The corresponding time correlation function can be written as: C(f) = (s(to)s(to + #)) — 33 where
33 = (s(to)) (s(to + t)). This can be written as we know that here (s(fp)) is independent of ¢ and
therefore (s(to)) = (s(to + #)) = so. Just as in the CCM walk, here (so) 4 0 unless near A for both the
Models A and B. The correlations for Models A and B are shown in figure 10. It is seen that there
is a strong correlation near t= 1 which gradually decreases with increasing 4x. The short time
correlations in both Models A and B are negative. This is consistent with the fact that direction
reversal probability is greater than 1/ 2. However, for one particular 4; the correlation ultimately
saturates to a value Csat when tf > oo.

This kind of feature was earlier noted in [46]. The saturation value C.at is estimated by
averaging near the end over a few hundred values of t. Csat as a function of 4, is shown for
my = 0.1 for both Models A and B in figure 11a. It is seen that Csat reaches a minimum close to AK
which is 0.471 for Model A and 0.443 for Model B. The minimum value of Csat as observed for
AR Ag is ~ (10-5). Also as we observe the strongest correlation C(1) is changing with A,, we
plot the same in figure 11b. It is observed that as we increase threshold line m,, the correlation
over one step C(1) becomes weaker and weaker for lower Ax values. However, for high Ax for
all my values, C(1) is almost a constant. This feature is similar in Models A and B but for higher
values of m, the strength of maximum correlation, i.e. C(1) is weaker for a particular m;, in Model
