A re-examination of the margin of the other hemisphere of the egg, in the region
corresponding to its oblique intersection with the primitive streak, now resulted in
the discovery of the anterior segment of the latter, so that we were at length
enabled to correlate the two portions of the streak and its surrounding area, which
had been separated from one another in the original bisection of the ovum in situ.
The area of the blastoderm surrounding the primitive streak was recognisable as
slightly more opaque than elsewhere, corresponding with the extension of a
mesodermal sheet like that which we had previously found in the corresponding
situation in the sections of specimens D and DD.

From the above general account of the structural features manifested by the four
specimens referred to, it will appear that they all concur in the fact of the
differentiation of a primitive streak, and of an area surrounding it on either side, in
which the blastoderm is trilaminar ; and also in the presence of a “primitive” or
“archenteric” knot, quite distinct from the primitive streak and its area. The knot
is not only distinct from the streak, but lies at some distance from its anterior end,
and the blastoderm in its immediate vicinity is bilaminar merely.

Seeing that the primitive knot contains an archenteric or gastrulation-cavity, more
or less typically differentiated, this stage of Ornithorhynchus development may
appropriately be termed the “ gastrular” stage, the “second phase of gastrulation”
having now clearly manifested itself.
