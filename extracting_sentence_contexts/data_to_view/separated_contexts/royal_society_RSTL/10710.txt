discovery, because it seems impossible, by appeal to the commonly received theories of
golution, to find a satisfactory explanation of all the facts of the case. If we admit that
sodium sulphate, placed in contact with water ab temperatures below 34®, dissolves
in virtue of its power of entering into union with water to form liquid hydrates,
the diminished solubility above that temperature must be due to dissociation of
these hydrates, and production of the anhydrous salt, which is apparently much less
soluble. What then is the cause of the much greater soJubility of the ordinary
crystals in which the salt is already united with a large quantity of water, and how
can we explain the fact that the anhydrous alt increases in s0lubility in accordance
with the common rule when the temperature is raised? The explanation appears to
be found in the difference of fusibility of the two compounds, Na,SO,10HzO melting
at 34®, and Na,SO,, which melts at 860*. There is nothing new in the idea that readiness to melt by heat is associated with
disposition to dissolve by contact with liquid 80lvents, for even s0 far back as 1819 we
find Gay Lus8Ac quoting with approval a till older explanation given by LavoiseR
(*Trait6 Elem. de Chimie.,” 11., 39)* of the action of heat in causing increase of s0lubility.
