is F,(5). For m=6 the formula gives F, (6) = 23582'83. There is a doublet at
23667'07 (28), 23919°27 (1°14) with a separation 25220, and no others in the neigh-
bourhood. If these are the displaced F (6), the normal F (6) would be 23595°82 and
23855'93 and the observed lines 2366707 = F, (6) (9A,) and 23919°27 = F, (6) (8A,).
The calculated normal lines have separation 260°11, or practically 260°17. A line at
23995'83 is 413 = 260+153 ahead of the calculated F,(6). It is therefore the

“undisplaced F, (6).

There are a large number of other lines clearly related to the F type. Their
complete discussion would require a more searching investigation than can be given
now. Several sets are related in a manner which is quite common in spark and rich
are spectra, indicated by the fact that a number of lines may differ in succession by
nearly the same separation—a kind of relation which cannot be due to collateral
displacement by equal denommator differences. There are a few also which seem to
be attached parasitically to S and D lines. There may be uncertainty also as to

whether the separations shown which differ from 260 and 158, differ through a
satellite effect, or by successive collaterals of 153 and 93. For instance, putting

153= A’, F\(@)—F, (2) (4’) = 26410, -F,(#) (—A’) —F, (%) = 256'39,
F, (2) (—2A’) —F,() (—A’) = 252°35,
