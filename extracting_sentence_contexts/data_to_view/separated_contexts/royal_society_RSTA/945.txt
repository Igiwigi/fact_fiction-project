The next step is to consider the map W : (x,y, 4,9) +> (X,¥, i,@) and after this continue working
with the forms 2 and W*(). Now (x,y,4,9) is a common ‘good’ coordinate system for both
systems and the conditions of theorem 5.4 are still fulfilled for @ and w*(@). After this, it remains Dos
to apply proposition 5.3 for the integrable systems (H, F, 2) and (A, F, ¥*(@)). =

The fact that (i) implies (ii) follows from the assumption that the symplectic forms 2 and 38
Q induce the same orientation and coorientation on yo. Indeed, this implies that preserves the :
homology classes of y and jz. on each ‘narrow’ torus. Therefore, if we set x = ©*x in the definition nee)
of the actions I(H, F) and I,(H, F), then I(H, F) = I(H, F) and I,(H, F) =1.(H, F). | 72

Note that due to analyticity it is sufficient to compare the actions only on the family of ‘narrow’ : a
tori, although I and I are defined on the whole neighbourhood U(yp). :S
