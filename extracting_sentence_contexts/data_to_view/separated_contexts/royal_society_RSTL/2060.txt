of vision being imparted to a lady born
blind, by an operation. at an advanced period of life, will, it
is hoped, not be considered unworthy of being submitted to
the consideration of the Royal Society. The case, besides establishing the curious physiological
fact, that the nerve of the eye can remain fit to receive the
impressions of external objects, though totally excluded for
a long series of years from the performance of that function,
claims a much higher interest in a philosophical point of
view ;.s0me of the facts here-detailed confirming in a re-
markable manner what BERKELEY had predicated of *© a man
born blind being made to '8ee,”” in the 79th Section of his
« New Theory of Vision,”” published in the year 1709. He
8ays, © a man born blind being made- to \see, would, at the
first opening of his eyes, make very different judgements of
the magnitude of objects intromitted by them from what

others do. He would not consider the ideas of sight with
reference to, or as having any connection with the idea of
touch.”
