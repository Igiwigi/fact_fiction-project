Figure 2. Life-history processes and the central role of females as mothers in cetacean societies. (a) Duration of key life-history processes of female toothed whales
(Odontoceti) and baleen whales (Mysticeti). Split violin plots indicate the probability distributions of log-transformed length of gestation and lactation (mean), inter-
birth interval (mode), maturity (mean age at first birth) and longevity (maximum lifespan) across 13 Mysticeti species (red) and 43 Odontoceti species (blue).
Dashed lines within violins indicate mean values. (b) Speed of female life-history processes relative to body length between toothed and baleen whales. Age
at sexual maturity correlates highly with all other life-history traits and thus is used here as a summary measure of the other life-history processes. Shaded circles
