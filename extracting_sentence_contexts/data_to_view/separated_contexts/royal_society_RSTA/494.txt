The asymptotic value is unity ifthe pulse continues to propagate indefinitely, although
the results are valid, as far as they go, if the pulse is of any finite length greater than 8d. It

is, in fact, implicit in the calculations that the pulse will terminate at some point, since it
has been tacitly assumed that the region in which the energy is calculated is affected only by
the returning wave. In the second case E,(s)/4p(2b) is plotted giving the proportion of total energy returning
along the channel. The asymptotic value of this quantity is not known, although, from (83),
it is certainly less than 0-43.
