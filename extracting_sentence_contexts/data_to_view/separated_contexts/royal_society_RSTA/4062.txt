Thus, here the out-of-plane shear stresses are assumed to vary as follows:

where h, is the thickness of the shear layer, m, is the number of plies in the shear layer and t is the
ply thickness. After some mathematical calculations and equation rearrangements (e.g. appendix
A in [26]), the interface shear stresses are obtained as

Here, 69k = 1,2, are the out-of-plane shear moduli of the kth layer. As the presence of aligned
microcracks does not affect the value of the out-of-plane shear moduli (this fact is emphasized
by marking them with a circumflex (~)), the shear lag parameters Kj are the same for ECM1 and
ECM2. The equilibrium equations, equation (3.1), along with expressions for the interface shear
stresses (equation (3.8)), the laminate equilibrium equations (equation (3.4)), and constitutive
equations (equation (3.6)), provide a full set of equations, which are required for determining
the in-plane microstresses all a can =1,2 in the perfectly bonded regions of the representative

segment of the ECMu. For instance, ay 1) can be found from the following set of eight equations
