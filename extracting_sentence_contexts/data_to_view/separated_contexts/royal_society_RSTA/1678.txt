Both topologies have their disadvantages: On one hand, the norm topology is too
strong to reflect the properties of X. On the other hand, equipping C,(X) with the compact-open
topology generally does not yield a complete topological vector space. In fact, C},(X) is dense in
the space C(X) of all continuous complex-valued functions on X with respect to the compact-open

topology. In order to circumvent these problems we ‘mix’ the two topologies. We refer to [24,25]
for an introduction to locally convex topologies.
