This result shows that at low temperatures the jumps existing in the surface are due essentially
to adsorbed molecules; in fact, the proportion of molecular positions on the surface occupied
by adsorbed molecules is 7 = exp (—2¢/kT) ; as every adsorbed molecule has four horizontal
bonds, the number of these bonds per molecule due to adsorbed molecules turns out to be
equal to (94). In an actual crystal surface there will also be vacant surface sites in number
equal to that of adsorbed molecules, therefore s should be 87*; the reason why (94) is only
half of that is, clearly, the assumption of a two-level model. In fact there will also be on the
crystal surface nuclei of adsorbed molecules and holes consisting of more than one vacant
surface site, but their concentration will be very small at low temperatures. Provided that is
so, they can be considered as independent entities, and their concentration is proportional
to 7° for nuclei (or holes) of two adsorbed molecules (or vacant surface sites) and to higher
powers of 7 for greater nuclei (or holes). As the temperature approaches the transition point,
the concentration of these nuclei becomes larger and they cannot be considered as inde-
pendent entities; the problem must then be considered as a co-operative phenomenon.

It is interesting to compare (93) with the result that we would have obtained if we had
assumed no geometrical constraints in the surface; it is easy to see that under these conditions

s would have been given by
