like concentrations of magnetic flux. It is difficult to see any way around the idea that magnetic
reconnection is going on continuously in the corona and converting magnetic free energy into
heat. Additionally, many of the open flux tubes that reach into the heliosphere are rooted in the
magnetic carpet, and their footpoints are often in close proximity to the rapidly evolving closed
loops. Thus, it is natural to propose that some of the mass and energy of the solar wind is injected
from closed to open flux tubes by reconnection (e.g. [68-71]).7

The idea of a reconnection-driven solar wind is relevant to a discussion of coronal turbulence,
since the two phenomena (turbulence and reconnection) are nearly always seen in tandem. On
the one hand, the rate of driven reconnection may be modulated—or even determined—by the
properties of ‘background’ turbulence [77]. On the other hand, the dissipation of an MHD cascade
is likely to be governed by the behaviour of spontaneously formed reconnection regions on kinetic
scales (e.g. [78,79]). The situation is complicated by the fact that the Poynting flux associated with
the emergence of closed-loop regions (which presumably drive the reconnection) is seen to be
roughly 10° W m~? [69], which is of the same order of magnitude as the Alfvén wave energy flux
discussed above. Thus, it would not be surprising if the corona were heated by an inseparable
combination of wave/turbulence dissipation and magnetic reconnection.

2Reconnection is also believed to be a dominant process in driving coronal heating in the primarily closed-field corona of active
regions and the quiet Sun, but that topic is slightly beyond the scope of this review (e.g. [72-76]).


Observations of coronal plumes and jets provide evidence for the existence of discrete
reconnection events in open-field regions [80,81], However, these bright and narrow features are
identifiable in images, because they appear to occupy a small fraction of the coronal volume at
