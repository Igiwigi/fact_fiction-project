particularly those reactions connected with formation and decomposition of those
substances present when “ knock ”’ occurs.

6G—EstTImMATION OF ALDEHYDES

During the tests described in § 1, the concentrations of aldehydes were also deter-
mined in most cases. The results are expressed in figs. 13 and 14. The figures for
the concentration of aldehyde were taken from the previous calibration curves.

It will be noted that cyclohexane and hexane give similar results to the former
ones with Shell petrol cited in Part I, and that butane also gives a similar type of
curve, though with a smaller maximum. The formaldehyde from methane shows
still less of a peak. These facts may possibly indicate that, at the peak, higher
aldehydes are present which are rapidly burnt, and only the formaldehyde survives.
Experiments to test this hypothesis are quoted below, but it has been difficult to
reach a final decision.

There is the evidence from absorption spectra that in the combustion of a hydro-
carbon* the higher aldehydes, whether they are formed immediately or not, are not
