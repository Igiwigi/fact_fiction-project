When #=2#; there will be an ordinary cusp, and when =1, Z=0.

"There will therefore be three branches, —one corresponding to the values of # between
—yF and +75, the other two to values of # between these limits and — and +
infinity respectively. The middle branch passes through the origin, where it under-
goes an inflexion, and comes to a cusp at a finite distance from the origin in two
opposite quadrants. The connected branch at each ensp crosses the axis of z, sweeps
conyexly towards the axis of 2, arrives at a minimum distance from it, and then goes off

to infinity.
The value 4; for #® corresponds to —Þ for , and gives, as it ought to do, the cusp-
node. In fact the values Þ=—#, @=—2 correspond respectively to a cuspidal and to

a cusp-nodal line in the limiting surface whose sections we haye been considering.
When the cutting plane is that of D itself, the section becomes a double cubic para-
bola and a single cubical parabola crossing each other at the origin.

Hence at either cusp the branch the further removed from the axis of & corresponds to the yalues of #* be-
tween 1 and >, and the inferior branch to its values between 1 and +; 80 that the order of continuity of the
