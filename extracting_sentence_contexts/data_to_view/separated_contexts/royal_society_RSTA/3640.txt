Assume a; € (0,2~°(ro/R)*), and let € be the excess energy, defined by
:= inf E, — mi v).
c= inf n(u, €) anin, Fo(®)

Then there exist constants hg > 0, co > 0 and cy < 00, all depending on as,r9 and R, such that for any
h € (0,ho) the excess energy € satisfies
1
coh<e<Kx(—)h,

where the correction x(t) := exp(ci (log py log(log t)) grows slower than t* for any a > 0. As the minimum of the effective functional gives the leading-order elastic energy as h > 0,
it is important to note that its minimizer can be made entirely explicit. In fact, assuming


as in theorem 2.1 that as; <2~8(r9/R)* and using the Euler-Lagrange equation for Fo, it is
straightforward to compute that

with ry i= (160/79 R2)1/3. The first interval (0,7) in (2.5) corresponds to the unwrinkled
region, while the second interval (rj»,r9) corresponds to the wrinkled region. The condition
as < 2~8(r9/R)? is equivalent to rv < 19, i.e. it ensures that the wrinkled region is non-trivial.
