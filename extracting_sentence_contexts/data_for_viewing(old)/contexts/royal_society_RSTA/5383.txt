due to the relatively low temperature (~380°C) of the chosen oil storage, the resulting temperature
difference (DT) for the thermal storage has been only DT = 96°C. Higher temperature plants
presently under construction can operate with higher temperatures, for instance, DT = 275°C,
reducing the volumes and costs by a factor of about three. While the molten salt solution is today
a fully operational technology, other forms of storage are under active development, for instance,
based on different and cheaper heat-storing media, such as pebble beds or even concrete.



As far as thermal losses are concerned, strong insulation and adequate sizing of the equipment
can reduce the losses to moderate values. Storing 1MWh in a tank of molten salt with a
temperature jump of 200°C requires 6 m°of salts. Even if an overall thermal efficiency of 50 per
cent is assumed, the size is 12m> MWh7!. This fact changes the perspective for CSP because it
can generate electricity with a sound capability to stabilize a futuristic electric system with a high
share of renewable energy sources.

Of course, this opportunity will be restricted to locations with high levels of direct solar
radiation, typically deserts, which are very far from the high consumption zones of central and
northern Europe. This implies the need to send electricity along several thousand kilometres, but
this is a challenge that could be answered with an adequate effort on superconductivity, although
other alternatives based on high-voltage DC transmission lines must also be taken into account.
This fact also implies that air cooling will be mandatory for CSP plants because there will not be :
any water available for it. 22
