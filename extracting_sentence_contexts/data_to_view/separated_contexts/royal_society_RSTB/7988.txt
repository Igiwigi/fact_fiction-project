Parenthetically, the
mice display a 67 per cent reduction in testicular above described inhibitory effects of androgens on

ogenic genes and a marked reduction in T secretion, show that elimination of the AR in SC of jsd mice (by
confirming the need for an active AR for normal the generation of SCARKO-jsd mice) does not restore
Leydig cell development. The decrease in androgen spermatogonial differentiation, whereas treatment of
