With regard to the source in the «-photograph of the strong spot of spacing 4-65 A.
which appears on the equator of the @-photograph, we have to assume, since the fibre
density is approximately constant, that this spacing is derived from one of roughly
twice this amount on the equator of the «-photograph, a spacing which is a measure
of the effective width of the secondary fold in its own plane (001). The «-photograph
has already been discussed in detail, 1, but it is so poor in interpretable diffraction data
that we can only say that both equatorial spots, the small diffuse spot near the centre
of mean spacing about 27 A., and the (probably complex) spot of spacing 9-8 A., could
conceivably supply the spacing required. Fig. 26 (A) and (B), Plate 9, shows an atomic model of part of the «-keratin system
of folded main-chains linked by side-chains, (A) being a view in the direction [001] and
(B) in the direction [100], Again no significance must be attached to the particular
side-chains used (they are of equal lengths in this model and correspond, as a matter of

fact, to cystine “rungs ”’—see below). Fig. 26(C), Plate 9, shows the same mode
pulled out into the $-form and viewed in the direction [100]; it is the counterpart
of fig. 26 (D), in which the side-chains have been made of different lengths. These
models, in addition to illustrating the arguments brought forward above, serve also,
since the $-models were derived simply by extension of the corresponding «-models,
to bring out another important point, that the transformation of a-keratin to 6-keratin
does not necessarily involve the rupture of direct cross-linkages.
