2. Prequel to the current model of allantois
development

When earnest study of the mouse allantois began several dec-
ades ago, facts were scarce. The general morphological
sequence of allantois development in rodents had been
described [1,2], and included the spatio-temporal where-
abouts of the allantoic bud, its enlargement and extension
toward the chorion, and union with the latter to create the
chorio-allantoic placenta (figure 1a). The allantois appeared
to issue from the posterior end of the embryo in register
with its primitive streak, or body axis, whose physical bound-
aries were claimed to be limited to the embryo [7,8].
Brachyury (T) was involved in umbilical genesis, as mouse
embryos homozygous for the T deletion exhibited a foreshor-
tened and misshapen allantois [9]. Since the 1950's, the base
of the allantois has been regarded as the temporary home
