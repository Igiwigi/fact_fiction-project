In [8,26], it was shown that simple laminates are sufficient to study the separate and : a
the lower relaxation. Interestingly, our method solves the question of upper relaxation even in : Sg
cases where there are microstructures that are not laminates. DN

The difficulty in the construction of MRS lies in the fact that On(t) € P, while the weak limit Ox € : z
Z in general. Similarly, for general test functions @ € Z, we have to find 6, € P with 6, — 6. This 2S

will be done by constructing hierarchical microstructures based on 6, and much finer laminates
with normal direction w, such that A(w,) = 0 (see proposition 5.2).
