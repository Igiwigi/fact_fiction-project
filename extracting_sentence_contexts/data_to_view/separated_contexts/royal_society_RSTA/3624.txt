Xenos argues against the current appropriation of the term ‘austerity’ to the field of : Ss
economics. Based on the etymological ‘bitter’ roots of the word, the common use of the term Dh
‘austerity’ in the economic context does not take into account the fuller, historically rooted and : Ss
more virtuous account of austerity as an aversion of ostentation and excess. Xenos argues that 18

economic policies labelled as ‘austerity measures’ are in fact based on an ascetic programme
of self-restraint and deferred gratification (for future growth) aimed at the weakest in society. Opponents of this logic propose economic stimulus in pursuit of growth. Xenos argues that, in
contrast with both the use of pro-austerity and anti-austerity within the current policy dialogue,
a truly austere politics would require the abandonment of the shared logic of growth.
