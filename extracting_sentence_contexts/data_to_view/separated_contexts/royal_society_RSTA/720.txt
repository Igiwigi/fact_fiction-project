In some volcanic regions, notably in Hawaii, earthquakes occur most frequently
when magma is falling in the volcanic crater. On the other hand, the history of
events in the Lesser Antilles suggests that earthquakes occur most frequently in this
region at times of increasing magmatic pressure. The fact that seismic activity has,
in some instances, terminated with the occurrence of a volcanic eruption is then to
be regarded as a consequence of the release of magmatic pressure. It is possible that

such a release of pressure was brought about in the neighbourhood of Montserrat by
the occurrence of the severe earthquake of 10 November 1935. The most plausible explanation of the local earthquakes in Montserrat is therefore
that they are due to magmatic intrusion.
