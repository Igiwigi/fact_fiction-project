The forensic evidence in theory
and in practice can be flawless, but de facto, its contribution
and effect on the legal proceedings (and the judicial system in
general) can be considerably damaged and degraded (if not
made totally inappropriate). This, although indirectly, is a
concern for forensic science. Cognitive neuroscience has many insights into how humans
function as trier of fact, and can (and should) be used to improve
these processes [5]. For example, understanding human
memory and cognitive load gives insights into what forms of
information are well encoded, well remembered and well
used. For instance, the primacy and recency effects demonstrate
how order and sequencing of information influences what actu-
ally is most remembered [6], as do anchoring effects [7].
