possible question to address is whether the scaling exponents depend on the Re number.

We numerically checked that neither nor y are functions of Re. In figure 10, we show P[tw]
for v = 10-7, 10~? and 10~!: upon changing Re by 4 orders of magnitude, the scaling exponent a
does not change (the same is true for y, not shown). The only relevant change in P[tw] concerns
the range where scaling is observed which seems to decrease with Re.

Another important point is how to properly define scale invariance for the probability
distribution P[tw]. Interevent times (sometimes referred to as return times or waiting times) are
important statistical variables discussed for many theoretical frameworks in physics. Given a
random (intermittent) process v(t), one can study P[t»,L] as a function of the time at which
v(t) is larger than some level L. In the case discussed in this paper, P[tw,L] does not show any
scale invariance. In fact, upon changing L, we are also changing our definition of event size. Our
approach, following [6], is to fix the definition of event and then disregard it in the computation
of tw events of size larger than some threshold S,: we are looking at some longer time for the
same set of events. One may argue that this is a minor detail, but we have clearly shown that this
is not the case in our system and we argue the same is true for other physical systems.

There is no a priori reason to assume that the interevent time distribution P[tw] is scale-invariant
in the sense discussed in this paper (see also the discussion at the end of §4 and [7]). However,
it is a remarkable result, here presented for the first time, that if scale invariance holds then the
scaling exponents of size and interevent time distributions must be related.
