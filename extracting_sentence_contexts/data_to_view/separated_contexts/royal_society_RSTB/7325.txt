SoME FACTS CONCERNING CHRYSOMYIA MARGINALIS

It was not possible to conduct experiments with C. marginalis on the extended scale used
with the other species. Because of this, the data available for C. marginalis were not con-
sidered when these flies were discussed. Before examining the practical aspects of the
results obtained, it seems worth while to give the facts that are known. These throw some
light on the role that is played by C. marginalis on the carcass. To do this is the more desirable,
since this species has been chosen, on very flimsy evidence, as the main factor controlling
populations of primary flies on carrion in the field (see Hepburn 19436, Ménnig 1942,
Ménnig & Cilliers 1944).
