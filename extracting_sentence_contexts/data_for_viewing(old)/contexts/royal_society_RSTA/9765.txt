which may be written down by multiplying the rows of the later scheme into the

columns of the former, as if they were determinants. It will be shown hereafter that
this rule is remarkably well adapted for numerical calculation—a fact that does not

given by the scheme

seem to have been remarked before. The scheme corresponding to any system, as, for
example, any thick lenses, arranged at intervals along an axis, may be built up from
its elements by this rule, by writing down the schemes in order belonging to the
successive refracting surfaces and shifts of origin, and compounding these; if we have
to compound in this manner a sequence of schemes
