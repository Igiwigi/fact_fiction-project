circulation, is no criterion by which to judge whether red blood can make its way
into parts generally considered colourless. Por, at Â«, a portion of vessel is filled with
corpuscles, having a diameter not much more than half of that usually ascribed to
them : the fact being that, besides the minuteness of the objects into which blood-
corpuscles may divide, the form of the corpuscles is susceptible of every change ; and
