(b) Kreyberg’s white label albino. Also prolific breeders, these albino mice, isolated by
Kreyberg, have been preserved because of their susceptibility to spontaneous cancer. It
was observed that about 80°, of the females of this strain developed mammary carcinoma
by the time when, at twelve or fourteen months of age, they became senile.

(c) Strong’s A albino, Even more prone to develop mammary cancer than Kreyberg’s
strain, these mice proved to be poor breeders with a relatively high mortality at the time
of birth in both the young and their mothers.

It soon became apparent that the mice of these three strains responded in an exactly
similar manner to the treatment given, and they were therefore mixed indiscriminately in
the various experimental groups. The results obtained were in no way affected by the
fact that some of the mice used had previously been mated whereas others had not, but
care was taken that only mice of about six months of age which exhibited normal steady
oestrous cycles were included in the experiments.

All the animals were reared and kept at a temperature which varied only between 15 and
20° C, and they were exposed to a constant daily light period of 12 hr. The diet was as
varied as possible, but it was uniform week by week. Oats, maize, dog biscuit, bread, milk
with cod-liver oil, and lettuce were given, and with this treatment the stock of mice was
maintained in good breeding condition. No diseases of any kind appeared in the colony,
and with the exception already mentioned of some mortality at parturition among the
Strong’s A albinos, no deaths occurred.
