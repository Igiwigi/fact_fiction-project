marked, the lateral wings being more bulky and extended ; in Todea the winged
development is not exclusively lateral, but is continued transversely across the face
of the phyllopodium, 80 as to form a conspicuous sheath ; bub this continuation is
only formed at a comparatively late stage. In Angiopteris it is present from a very
early period, and is closely connected with the formation of the * stipules.” By
means of Todea an explanation is afforded of the probable nature of the stipule in
Angiopteris. As I have above pointed out, it may with good reason be regarded as an
advanced modification of that winged conformation, 80 clearly seen ab the base of the leat'
in other Ferns. A similar explanation will serve also for Ceratozamia and Stangeria.*
In other forms, especially among the Cycadacec, the base of the phyllopodium shows

* The extension of the stipular development transyersely across the face of the phyllopodium is not
an isolated morphological fact : a similar extension is also to be found in the development of orbicular
leaves, snch as Tydrocotyle, Tropeolum, &c. This bas been clearly shown by Gogser (f Vergl, Rntw.,” p. 234).
It will remain for future observations to 8show how far a similar comparative treatment may be applied
to the stipules of Dicotyledons,

characters resulting from distention, &c., but the variation from the winged
structure is Jess marked ; till in many cases the distinction is apparently accentuated
by the abortion of the upper parts of the leaf, as in the scale-leaves, in which a
correspondingly greater lateral extension is found. But this apparent accentuation
of the difference between the hypopodium and the upper part should not clond our
