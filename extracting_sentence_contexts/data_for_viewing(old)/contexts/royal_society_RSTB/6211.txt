Saturation deficiency mm Hg

Fic. 11—The weights of puparia of Glossina submorsitans at the end of puparial life in relation to the
saturation deficiency of the air in which they were kept. The puparia were kept at 24° C (75-2° F)
and 30°C (86-0°F) and at four different humidities. Further particulars are given in
Table XXI.

were kept. The lines produced are nearly straight at either temperature, showing
that the loss of weight is almost proportional to saturation deficiency and therefore
due to evaporation. It is also apparent that more weight is lost at 24° than at 30° C.
This is probably due to the fact that the weights were taken at the end of puparial
life, on the 31st day in the case of those puparia at 24° and on the 20th day in those at
30° C. It is possible to allow for the differences in time by calculating the product of

This expression gives a “standardized loss.” Reference to Table XXI shows that for
Glossina submorsitans the value of this is nearly the same at both temperatures and all
humidities except the highest. The figures for tachinoides do not show this, but the num-
bers are less. The conclusion may be drawn that differences in loss of weight are closely
proportional to saturation deficiency except at high humidities. The standardized loss
is nearly always higher in ¢achinoides than in submorsitans under the same conditions.
