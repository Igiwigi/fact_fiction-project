by an instantaneous increase at 18 hr. As regards the initial phase, no serious error can arise from ignoring this, because
the current systems induced by the first rapid decrease of e,(¢) will be almost exactly
annulled by the equal and opposite current system induced by the rapid recovery of
e(t). This is, in fact, proved by the observations, which show that i, (¢) recovers its initial
value at almost exactly the same time as ¢,(t). An instantaneous increase of e;(¢), such as that assumed at ¢ = fj, would produce the
maximum possible value of i,(¢)), viz

$9q°A, which is independent of «. This value of
i,(f) would correspond to a distribution of induced currents on the surface of the
conductor, which would rapidly diffuse into its interior, Therefore, for a short period
after time ¢— ty, the induced field would rapidly decrease.
