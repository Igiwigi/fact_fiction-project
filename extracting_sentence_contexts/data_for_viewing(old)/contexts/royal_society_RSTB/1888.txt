will be required before this conclusion may safely be arrived at.

Strength of Eaxcitation—I have observed more than once (but am unable to
reproduce the experiment at will) that nerve in the: 8rd stage giving with weak
tetanisation the deflection N., gives with stronger tetanisation the deflection 8S. The

following is a case in point (826), which is reproduced in fig. 47, partly in order to

give an example of how such measurements are made, partly because a critic may
see in it internal evidence of some possible explanation or fallacy that I am unable to
detect. The facts here signify possibly that the nerve has been iu such a state that
fixed anelectrotonus was manifested at lower current strength than fugitive katelec-
trotonus, This possibility of a fixed anelectrotonic component is further supported
