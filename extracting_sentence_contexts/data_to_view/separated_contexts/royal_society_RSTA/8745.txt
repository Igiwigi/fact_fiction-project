Some of the points in I. x, II. ©, and VI. e might seem to suggest a slower voltage
approach to saturation than the normal, and it was thought that this effect might be

attributable to the rather high gas pressures which developed in these experiments. The fact that IIT. 4, in which the pressure was kept down to 0-002 by operating the
pumps continuously, does not show this tendency, would seem rather to support such
a contention. An examination in detail of the data, however, isagainstit. For example,
in I. x and VI. e the currents at the high voltages were measured at the lower pressures
and in IL. © conversely.
