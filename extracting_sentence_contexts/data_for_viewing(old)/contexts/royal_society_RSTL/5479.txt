which will be of the form La%**+ &c., all the terms containing powers of z s8uperior
to 5; vanishing by the coefficients becoming zero. If in the above expression we
$hould use 5; in lien of s;, where 5; is 5; diminisbed by any integer inferior to @,, we should
get other forins of the same residue, but these will all be of higher dimensions in the
roots or coefficients than the one just given, and in fact the forms thus obtained
corresponding to the values s;, —1, 6—2, ....c=;+1 substituted for ; in succes-
sio0n, would by aid of the relations of condition between the coefficients of Þx and
Fz implied in the value of «; admit of being exhibited'as a scale in which each form
would be an exact algebraical product of the form which precedes it, multiplied by a
function of the coefficients, and did space permit thereof it would be perfectly easy to
give the forms of these multiplicators. But I pass on to the representation of what
is more material, viz. the form of the complete residue in the case supposed, merely
observing (as an obiter dictum) that the existence of each singular partial quotient
(meaning thereby a quotient non-linear in z) only affects the form of the single
simplified residue in immediate connexion with itself, and not at all the form of the
other residues antecedent or subsequent to that one.
