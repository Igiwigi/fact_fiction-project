exhibited by magnets, and from this it was but a step to bis celebrated theory of
molecular currents. He snupposed the molecules of a magnetic body to be surrounded
by such currents, which, however, in the natural state of the body mutually neutralized
each other, on account of their confused grouping. The act of magnetization he
supposed to consist in setting these molecular currents parallel to each other, and
starting from this principle he reduced all the phenomena of magnetism to the
mutual action of electric currents.

If we reflect upon the experiments recorded in the foregoing pages from first to
last; on the inversion of magnecrystallic phenomena by the substitution of a mag-
netic constituent for a diamagnetic ; on the analogy of the effects produced in mag-
netic and diamagnetic bodies by compression ; on the antithesis of the rotating
actions described near the commencement ; on the indubitable fact that diamagnetic
bodies, like magnetic ones, owe their phenomena to an induced condition into which
they are thrown by the influencing magnet, and the intensity of which is a function
of the magnetic strength ; on the circumstance that this excitation, like that of soft
iron, is of a dual character; on the numerons additional experiments which have
been recorded, all tending to show the perfect antithesis between the two classes of
bodies ;—we can hardly fail to be convinced that Mr. Farapar's first hypothesis of
diamagnetic action is the true one—that diamagnetic bodies operated on by magnetic
forces possess a polarity © the same in kind as, but the reverse in direction of that
acquired by magnetic bodies.” But if this be the case, how are we to conceive of
the physical mechanism of this polarity? According to CouLons's and Po1ss0N's
theory, the act of magnetization consists in the decomposition of a neutral magnetic
fluid ; the north pole of a magnet, for example, possesses an attraction for the south
