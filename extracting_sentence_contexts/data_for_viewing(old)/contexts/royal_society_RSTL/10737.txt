112 MR. H. TOMLINSON ON THE INFLUENCE OF STRESS

XVI., and XVII. on the alteration of specific resistance produced by strain, shows
most conclusively the superiority of platinum-silyer to German-silver in making
standard resistance coils.

We have seen also in Part I. that rest, materially in some cases and to a certain
extent in all, increases the elasticity of metals ; now German- slver wire furnishes a
conspicuous example of this ; and the curye in the table representing the increase of
torsional rigidity produced by rests, shows plainly that the restitution of elasticity and
electrical conductivity go hand in hand. And this circumstance, when taken in con-
junetion with the fact that there is no change in the dimensions of the wire which
would at all account for the increase of elasticity or conductivity, evidently teaches
us that when we can increase the elasticity without altering the mean molecular
distance, we at the same time increase the electrical conductivity.

Tar INFLUENCE OF PERMANENT STRAIN ON THE CHANGE OF ELECTRICAL
ConnucrrviITY PRODUCED BY ALTERATION OF TEMPERATURE.

Permanent extension, hammering, and torsion.

The previous observations on the change of specific resistance produced by extension,
hammering, and torsion having given rise to the snspicion that these processes caused
the wires to alter their 8usceptibility to change of resistance from change of tempera-
