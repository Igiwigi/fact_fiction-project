Tf this be not the case, Þ and X become functions of the angle of incidence, and have

Saot strictly the same values in the consecutive lines of Tables I. and II.

z To test the effect of this error experimentally I set the spar prism so that the

Zncident wave normal instead of lying in the principal plane was inclined to it ab

About, 10, and made a short series of measurements. SZ The results agreed very closely with those tabulated in Tables IL. and II, and

proved conclusively that the level error which I feel sure never amounted to as much

2” could not account for the difference between theory and experiment.

& The sme is fairly clear from the formulee, for in Table Il. we could reconcile theory
and experiment by supposing that at high angles of incidence Þ is somewhat greater
than 63? 44' 30”, and tha it decreases continually as the angle of incidence increases,
but this assumption would just tend to increase the differences given in Table IL. Thus a small variable error in the value of Þ will not account for the observed
facts. One point, however, needs further investigation. An error has been confessedly

- committed in the value of Þ.
