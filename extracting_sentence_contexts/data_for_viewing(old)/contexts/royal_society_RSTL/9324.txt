rays caused by each increment of CH, in the molecule.

The same fact is again noticeable in Diagram No. 3, Plate 23. Here, in order to get
rid of the inconvenience caused by the change of alkaline formates into oxalates on
evaporation, we made use of very beautiful specimens of barium salts. In this case
the formate is. the most transparent of salts, and it may be seen that the acetate bears
the same relation to it in transparency that in the case of the sodium alt the
propionate bore to the acetate.

A glance at Diagram No. 3 will show that a cell-full of the acids corresponding to
the ethylic and propylic alcobols, which we have every reason to believe are perfectly
pure substances, are less diactinic than the alcohols as shown in Diagram No. 1, which
fact points to the carboxyl group in the molecule possessing a special absorptive power
greater than that of hydroxyl. We have further evidence of this in the shorb
spectrum of oxalic as compared with acetic acid. The specimen examined was pre-
pared with great care and repeatedly recrystallised. There is every reason to believe
in its absolute purity.

The Ethereal Salts of Fatty Acids.

In examining regular series of formates, acetates, propionates, &c., of the radicles,
methyl, ethyl, and propyl, ib was expected that probably the majority of substances
would be of such a degree of purity that some relation between their constibution and
their optical properties would be traceable. About twenty specimens of these com-
pound ethers were obtained from Mr. KanrBaum; they varied in quantity according
