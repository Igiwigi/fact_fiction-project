With this may be compared the partial or complete septa in Danwa, and
other Marattiaceze.§ Somewhat analogous conditions are found in the stamens of
certain Angiosperms,|| in which sometimes the septa may be narrow and transitory,
and so appear as only partial septa in the mature stamen; or they may be broader,
and be found to be complete partitions in the mature stamen. Study of the
development has shown that the cells which form the septa in these cases are of similar
origin to the sporogenous cells, and the conclusion follows that the septa owe their
origin to sterile development of potentially sporogenous cells. Upon the facts thus quoted, the general statement may be based, that among
Vascular Plants examples of sterilisation of potentially sporogenous cells are common,
both in homosporous and in heterosporous forms, and that the sterile cells may be
functional only as transitory “ nourishing cells,” or persist as permanent tissue, forming
in some cases partial, in others even complete septa. Conversely, tissues which are normally sterile may sometimes contribute to the
formation of spores, though this is less common. An example has been seen in
Danea, where a packet of fertile cells was found evidently derived from tissue outside
the normal sporogenous group.
