Whilst experimenting at high temperatures, steam had to
be passed into the box to keep a constant temperature. By means of a small boiler,
heated by gas placed at some distance from the apparatus, this was casily effected. In
fact, by carefully regulating the gas, any temperature between 50Â® and 100? may be
kept constant for any time. A waste-pipe was fitted into the side of the box to allow
the water when it reached a certain level to flow away; as s0on as the temperature
became constant, the first weighing was proceeded with ; in the one pan of the balance,
large weights were placed 80 as to make that, side of the balance the heaviest; this
is brought into equilibrium by placing smaller weights in the other pan, namely, the
one to which the platinum wire is fixed. The balance stands in a glass case, and
$urrounding this is another glass case (not shown in the figure), to keep the tem-
perature of the balance as constant as possible.
