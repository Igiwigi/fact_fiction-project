In this way we arrive at the hypothesis of the whole con-
tractile sheet being pervaded by an intimate plexus of functionally differentiated tissue,
the constituent elements of which are capable of vicarious action in a high degree (se
severity of section in fig. 8). And this hypothesis, besides being recommended by the
consideraticn of its being the only feasible one that is open, is confirmed by the fact that
the stimuli which it supposes to escape from a severed phalanx of radial lines, and thus

* Tt may here be stated that tho greater sensitiveness of tho nutrient tubes is alsv made apparent by the
responses of the nectocalyx ; for to a nip or prick of the general contractile shect the response by the nectocalyx
uxually consists, as before stated, in a local bending in of the part irritated ; whereas in response to similar
irritation of a radial tube, the response is usually a general bending in of the whole nectocalyxâ€”4. e. a general
spasm. I may here obserye that cutting through all the nutrient tubes at; their insertion in the polypite has no effect
in preventing the localizing action of the latter as regards other parts of the bell.
