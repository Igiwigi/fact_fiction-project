if k be the conducting power of the porous solid for heat (the solid surrounding it being supposed to be an
infinitely bad conductor, or the circumstances to be otherwise arranged, as is practicable in a variety of ways,
80 that there may be no lateral conduction of heat), o the thermal capacity of unity of its bulk, and 0 the
thermal capacity of as much of the fluid as passes in the unit time. Now if, as is probably the case in the
actual circumstances, conduction through the porous solid itself is insensible in its influence as compared with
the convection of the fluid, this equation will become approximately

If F denote any arbitrary function, and if 6 be supposed to be constant, the general integral of this equation isâ€”

and if the arbitrary function be chosen to express by F (7) the given variation of temperature where the fluid
enters the porous body, we have the particular solution of the proposed problem. We infer from it that, at
any distance # in the porous body from the entrance, the temperature will follow the same law and extent of
