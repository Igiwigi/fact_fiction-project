Born outside the mainstream community of turbulence experts, it was
initially mostly ignored'* but then was accepted under the pressure of numerical results. As we
mentioned, the debates are not settled about the validity of possible modifications of the model. In parallel, some part of the community is still using the so-called two-dimensional plus slab
model of turbulence [182] in spite of the fact that it has no support via numerical simulations
with isotropic driving. We consider the latter as some parametrization of the actual heliospheric
turbulence over a limited range. This parametrization is not physically or numerically motivated
and therefore is not considered within the reconnection model.
