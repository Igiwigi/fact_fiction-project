The property of dilatancy, which Professxor REyNoLDs has shown that granular
media possess, does not in itself afford any clue to the changes which a directed
quality like that now under examination suffers when the condition of stress is varied.
But the same considerations (which explain why, in the changes of volume accom-
panying strain in a granular medium after vibration, there is a point of inflection
similar to that which is the most striking feature of these thermoelectric curyes)
suggesb that a granular medium may be the kind of molecular mechanism required to
account for the characteristics which have been described in this paper, and that the
remarkable feature in the hysteresis of thermoelectric quality with regard to stress
commented on in 13 and 41 is to be attributed to a periodic arrangement of
granules, The difficulty of any dynamical explanation is not a little increased by the
fact that the variations of magnetisgm which accompany variations of stress, while
otherwise not very dissimilar to the variations of thermoelectric quality, exhibit none
of this inflection, either when a change takes place from loading to unloading (or from

unloading to loading), or when the process of loading or unloading is resumed after the
metal has been s8ubjected to vibrations while supporting a load of any assigned value.
