This statement could be dismissed, but, in my view, it is deeply offensive, even cruel in its implications
and its effects. Anyone can hear the denial of this statement on the television news, nightly. Yet statements

progress, a reduction of 8 million undernourished people a year, there is no hope of meeting that goal?

Cereals constitute about one-half of the world’s food. The North American wheat crop has provided most
