Although this proposition in the abstract is very probable, it requires to be demon-
strated by direct experiment, and it is the more important to do $0, as it will furnish,
if true, a means of verifying the accuracy of our results. The reactions now described
enable us to test it by experiment in one particular set of cases. In fact, if we take
three bases, such as potash, oxide of copper, and water, capable of displacing one
another in the above order, and if we measure the changes of temperature produced
when the first and second, first and third, and second and third bases displace one
another, then the change of temperature arising from the first snbstitution should be
equal to the difference between the changes of temperature produced by the two
latter. A few examples will illustrate this point. The numbers expressing the heat developed when the nitrate of water is decom-
pozed by potash and lime are 6*76 and 720.
