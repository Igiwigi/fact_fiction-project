it is seen that the wave-lengths continually decrease with decreasing atomic weight
until we arrive at Li, when the wave-length jumps back above Na. Further from
analogy with the others LiP (1) should be a doublet with v = 1:5 about, and the LiS
and LiD should be all doublets of the same v, but, as a fact, they are all single, with
the possible exception of 4602, which Konen and Hacenpacu believe to be a double
line. For this reason in my first examination I left Li for separate consideration,
and as this was fully justified by the result, it may be well to proceed on the same
lines now. We shall discuss then first the well-known principal, sharp, and diffuse
series of the other alkalies, then the additional series which appear in the spectra,
and finally return to Li in the light of knowledge gained from the others.
