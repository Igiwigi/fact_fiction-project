In principle this could be evaluated by a WVQ expansion; in particular it is well known
and can be seen to have the same expansion coefficients as (p?D!| M | p?D'). All four con-
tributions have to be added together to give the value in table 11, and in actual fact this type
of integral is one of the most laborious to evaluate of those which are usually required for
variational problems. The expansion of M,, need not be analyzed in detail. It differs from that of M,, only in
the d? replacing 3.
