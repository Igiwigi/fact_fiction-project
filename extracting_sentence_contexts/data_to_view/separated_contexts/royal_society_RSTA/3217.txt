The functional RG advocated in this work is ideally suited
for this problem. As even the conventional estimates are compatible with a metastable but sufficiently long-
lived Higgs vacuum state, it is a legitimate question as to whether there is any relevant difference
for contemporary phenomenology, depending on which scenario is ultimately realized. In fact,
the interplay between stability, metastability and cosmology is currently actively studied within
various cosmological models [42,48-52]. If such considerations favored absolute stability but
the tension with the observed Higgs mass and the conventional bounds persisted, this could
point to new physics below the Planck scale (according to the conventional interpretation) or


correspond to a first measurement of properties of the microscopic action with a sufficiently deep
consistency bound. With respect to cosmology, also the thermal evolution of the Higgs potential is
of substantial interest.
