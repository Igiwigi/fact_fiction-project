Are there no
exceptions ? Is there no limitation ? '

As to exceptions, in the whole range of my experiments upon this snbject, I have
never met with a single instance of two substances baving 80 strong an affinity for
one another, that they combined to the exclusion of other bodies of like kind and
present in the same solution, even if in large excess*. Sometimes this rests not on
demonstrative but upon moral evidence, as for instance when sulphocyanide of
potassium and dissolved ferric ferrocyanide are mixed, where unquestionably the
amount of ferric sulphocyanide produced must be quite inappreciable, yet that some
is produced may be safely inferred I think from the fact, that snlphocyanide of
potassium does give a red with the ferric acetate, and acetate of potash is capable.
of decompoxing the ferric ferrocyanide to a well-marked extent.

* Oxybromide of iron certainly appeared to resist even citric acid ; but then it is not a binary compound. Anomalous rezults too were sometimes obtained on examining the solubility of such substances as phosphate
of iron in mixtures of salts and acids, but the phenomena were always of an obsecure character,

During the controversy that ensued after the publication of BgrraoLLeT's treatise,
many reactions were brought forward to prove the falsity of his views. Most of these
were directed against certain positions of the French philosopher which were certainly
untenable, while others were founded on a misapprebension of the question at issne.
