considerable support from the occurrence of various grades of abnormalities in place of
the normal ovuliferous scales, but in the Araucarieze no such evidence is available,
and the inference suggested is that the reproductive shoots of this section of the
Coniferales are more stable and fixed.

We are, therefore, disposed to doubt the validity of the comparison between
Araucaria and Cordaites. Moreover, the seeds of the latter differs considerably
from those of the former. Can we, on the other hand, bring the Araucarian cone
into closer touch with the strobili of recent or extinct Lycopods? With recent
species of Lycopodium the Araucarie agree in having strobili consisting of spirally-
disposed sporophylls, each with a single megasporangium,* but in shape the
Lycopodium sporangium differs from that of the Araucariez, a matter of secondary
importance. A more fundamental distinction is the fact that in one case we have
a naked sporangium and in the other a true seed. One of the many advances of
first-rate importance which we owe to Dr. Scorr,t is the demonstration of the
production of seed-like organs by an extinct Lycopodiaceous genus. The genus
Lepidocarpon is peculiar in having advanced a stage beyond that of the other
members of the Lycopodiales in the conversion by means of an outgrowth from the
sporophyll of a naked megasporangium into an organ which, as Scorr says, must
be included in the category of seeds,

In discussing the affinities of Lepidocarpon, Scorr writes: “Those who hold to
the belief that the Gymnosperms, or a part of them, sprang from Lycopods, may
find in the discovery of Lepidocarpon some support for their views.” If the
integument of Lepidocarpon, instead of forming a slit-like micropyle, were closed
