We add decoherence into our system model by introducing fluctuations into the system
Hamiltonian H(t) in equation (4.6). The resulting density matrix equation then takes the form
6=-iA) +AOk +hOSz +fa2kSz, pl, (4.7)

where f1(t), fa(t) and f3(t) are assumed to be uncorrelated fluctuations such that E[fi(t + t)f()] =
6,8(t)k;. This captures the fact that various terms contributing to the Hamiltonian fluctuate. This
leads to the master equation

b= iH), 01+ Littl, ell + tselis:, ol] + Sti2l-$-[2h5-, ol. (48)

Now, by choosing the frequency of the radiofrequency field w = a, where « is the resonance
frequency of spin I, and transforming into a rotating frame described by taking the density matrix

p(t) > exp(iHot)p(#) exp(—iHot),
we obtain that
6 =—il2JI-Sz + 01 cos P(t) Ixy + 2 sin b(f) ly, p] + L(p). (4.9)

where (x1,Y1,21) is a Bloch vector associated with the two-level system |00) and |10). Similarly,
(x2, Y2,Z2) is the Bloch vector associated with the two-level system |01) and |11). k = (k, + kg)/2.
