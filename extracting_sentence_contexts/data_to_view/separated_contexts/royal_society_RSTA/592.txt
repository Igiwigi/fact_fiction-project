It is only an act of copying, in other words, that brings organic
information into existence. This tells us that organic information is not just the specific sequence of a molecule, but the
specific sequence produced by a copying process. This definition underlines the fact that organic
information is not a thing or a property, but the result of a process. It is, more precisely, an operative
definition, because information is defined by the process that brings it into existence. We realize
in this way that organic information is as real as the copying process that generates it.
