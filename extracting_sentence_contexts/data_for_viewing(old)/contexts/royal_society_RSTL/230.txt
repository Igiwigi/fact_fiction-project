The black oxide of iron contained in them cannot be thrown
down by the addition of any of the hydrosulphurets, succinates,
gallates, or any other tests for iron. \

This oxide always accompanies the Prussic/ acid, when the
latter is transferred by NO affinities from "one base to
another.

For most of the facts just related; I'am indebted-to the ex-
cellent paper of PRovsT, entitled « Facts towards a History of
the Prussiates.” It appeared to me to be necessary to restate
these facts in order' to render clear the objects of this commu-
nication, which are to reconcile with the getieral properties of
other saline bodies the anomalies which*the triple prussiates
present ; to simplify the received opinion respecting their
nature, and to make known some new acids which : have dis-
covered.

In endeavouring to accomplish these objects, T'shall first
state my opinion of the nature of the triple prussiates-as they
are called, and afterwards support it by experiments.

I consider the $alts termed triple prussiates as binary com-
