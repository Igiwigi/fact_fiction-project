As the upper, minims are fixths to- thoſe next under
them, it follows, from the law-of harmonic ſounds, that
the lower minims are fifths to the fundamental ſounds
of theſe pipes, which are written in quavers, to ſhew that |
they are very difficult to be produced, The upper mi-
nims of N* 1. 2. 34+ 5. and alſo of 10. are ſharp thirds,
or rather, major tenths, to the, fundamental ſound-of
each pipe. And the upper minims of N* 6:7. 8.and'g,
are nearly minor tenths to their fundamentals; which
circumſtance ſeems to agree with what I remarked in
the ſmaller ſyſtem, as an extraordinary property,'touch-
ing the minor thirds. // + But I will not-yet afſert, that
this property is altogether natural, becauſe I found ſome
of theſe latter pipes were partly obſtrufed by accidental
rabbiſh, which was drawn out with difficulty ; ſo/ that I
pretend not to decide, whether the cauſe of, their be-
ing, not quite, in the ſame proportion of tune, as/I found.
in the firſt ſyſtem, ariſes from ſome caſual injury, or from
original intention, or original inaccuracy, {1 have!
aid, the upper minims of N* 6, 7. 8 and 9. are nearly
minor tenths /to their fundamentals; becauſe; in fact, I
found them ſomething more than 22#707, and yet not?
major; wherefore I have uſed the mark! (K), of a triple:
croſs, to ſignify ſomething more than (x), the double
croſs; and the mark of (x), a ſingle croſs, to ſignify a
diefis, or ſomething leſs than (x), the double croſs; which

ſay, plus: al ſemitone, neither more or leſs. For though'

the nicety of the dizfs is ſtealing inſenſibly into the fan-
