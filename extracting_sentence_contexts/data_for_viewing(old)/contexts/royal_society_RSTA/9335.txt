was then placed in water to allow it to recover its original length, a process which
oceupied three days, as opposed to the half-hour or so which would be required by normal,
untreated wool. A final photograph of the fibres in the relaxed state showed what
appeared to be the Â«-phase almost completely dispersed into continuous DeBye rings.

Tn order to convey a more complete impression of the changes just described, it must
be added that they are accompanied by progressive destruction of the wool protein and
by characteristic swelling phenomena of a magnitude depending on the strength of the
sulphide solution and the time of immersion. At the end of the experiments with
Cotswold wool the fibre bundle had shrunk to only a fraction of its initial size, yet had
the power of swelling enormously in the sulphide solution; and though the lateral
swelling amounted to perhaps 500 per cent., it was still further increased on transferring
the fibres from the solution to pure water, a fact which seems to indicate that in its later
stages the process is more or less of an osmotic nature. As would be expected, the
swelling power is largely lost on drying after washing out the sodium sulphide.

Hair saturated with NaS solution exhibits a jelly-like appearance, and its resistance
to extension is enormously decreased. A third series of experiments was carried out

* There is evidence, which will be given later, that Plate 2, fig. 68 is perhaps not strictly a photograph
of the B-phase, but of a derivative which gives an almost identical interference figure.

t Itis fascinating to watch the changes undergone by a hedgehog spine immersed in a 10 per cent. solution

of Na,8.9H,O. It will increase its length by some 50 per cent. and its thickness by several times ; but
