Specimen F has already been described, and the interpretation suggested that the
first, third, fifth, and seventh teeth have just erupted.

Specimen G is an old one and the teeth have been prepared very badly. The
following points are of interest, however. In the right side the fourth post-canine
tooth seems to be more tightly clasped by the bone than the others, the sixth tooth
(as shown in both sides) is small, and a seventh, also small, is present in the left
maxilla.

Specimen H is of considerable importance. In both maxillae the fourth tooth is
plainly just erupting—only the centre cusp being visible, fig. 6. Additional points
are the fact that while the first three teeth are very similar to those of specimen F
the six tooth is very much larger than in any of the smaller specimens. There is no
evidence for a seventh tooth having been present. An important point in the dentition
of this specimen is that the second incisor of the left premaxilla is smaller than that
of the right, and may be erupting.

In the largest specimen, I, the post-canine teeth are rather damaged. The fourth
and sixth teeth are seen to be as large as in specimen H and, what is of most import-
ance, the second tooth of the right side has a relatively enormous cusp and has the
appearance of being incompletely erupted.

This evidence of replacement may be summed up as follows:—The canine is
being replaced in the first animal, which is certainly very young, and the first upper
