Coox, together with a large number
of similar mirrors, all about equally good. The best unworked glass we have tried
was incomparably worse. The difficulty in making such thin mirrors out of glass
arises from the fact that they always change their shape when they come off the
polishing tool; but in our experience the change of shape is very regular, thus a flat
mirror almost always becomes concave or convex; but it does not do so irregularly,
and consequently the definition remains satisfactory. The glass, of course, is ground
and polished on both sides. The window through which the light passes to and from
the mirror, is a strip of patent plate-glass, selected by the method of observing the
reflected images from the front and back, and cutting the glass so that it forms a
prism of small angle along the top or bottom edge.
