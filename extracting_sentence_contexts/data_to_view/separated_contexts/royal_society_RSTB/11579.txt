Introduction

Migrating species play a keystone role in the functioning of many ecosystems;
they transport nutrients, connect disparate communities and act as both major
resource consumers and prey for resident species [1]. Recent technological devel-
opments have led to an unprecedented insight into the movement patterns of
animals [2]. However, despite the fact that many species migrate in groups
[3,4], most studies of animal migration neglect the potential role of social inter-
actions on movement decisions. Much research has shown that interactions are
important to consider, both in the context of collective animal behaviour [4-8]
and more generally in the study of complex systems [9]. While the potential importance of interactions in the decision-making of
animal groups is recognized, the barrier to quantifying these interactions among
wild, free-ranging animals is the difficulty in obtaining simultaneous, fine-scale
trajectories for every animal in a group [10].
