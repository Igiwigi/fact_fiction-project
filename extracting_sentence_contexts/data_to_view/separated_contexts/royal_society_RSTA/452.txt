The experiments examined so far do not tell us what the key locations are for observations
in order to give us the predictability in the AMOC and hence associated climate impacts. This
question was the subject of further idealized model experiments in [42] where the impact of
removing data in each of the following three regions was assessed in turn: (i) the North Atlantic
subpolar gyre (SPG), (ii) the tropical Atlantic, and (iii) the tropical Pacific (figure 16). In these
experiments, the AMOC was assessed at a latitude of 26 N (the latitude of the RAPID array—
discussed later), which is significantly south of the North Atlantic SPG region and in fact on
the edge of the tropical Atlantic region. Figure 16b shows that sustaining AMOC forecast skill
is dependent on initializing the North Atlantic SPG region. This is a nice illustration of the
widely held conceptual model of the AMOC (e.g. [43]) as being driven by density changes in
