Action of Water upon Zincethyl.

1 have already mentioned # that water and zincethyl snffer mutual, and almost
instantaneous decomposition, when brought into contact with each other, being trans-
posed into oxide of zinc and hydride of ethyl,

I have, in fact, already made use of this reaction as a means of analysing zincethyl,
and it is therefore only necessary for me here to prove the composition of the gas
evolved. For this purpose, a quantity of zincethyl was gradually decomposed by
water, and the gaseous product collected. It had all the physical and chemical pro-
perties of the hydride of ethyl I have already described F, and yielded the following
analytical results :
