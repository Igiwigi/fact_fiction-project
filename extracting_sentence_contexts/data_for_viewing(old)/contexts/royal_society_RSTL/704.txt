rine or sulphur ; and their oxides form peculiar triple com-
pounds with acid and alkaline or earthy substances. From
these analogies, -and especially the last, it might be pre-
sumed that platinum, like gold, by particular treatment, was
capable of furnishing a fulminating compound. Since plati-
num has been known to chemists, different attempts have
been made to produce such a compound, but without effect.
On the discovery of fulminating mercury by Mr. HowarD,
he endeavoured to communicate fulminating properties to
compounds of platinum, by means of alcohol, but his trials
were unsuccessful. I have to a certain extent succeeded in
this way, and my attempts have led- to the observation of
some new facts. I have also obtained a new compound of
platinum, analogous in its properties and composition to aurum
Fulminans, and which, in consequence, I shall venture to
designate by the term fulminating platinum. I have, indeed,
already noticed a peculiar compound of platinum under this
name,* but the term should be restricted to the new com-
pound, on account of its superior fulminating properties.
This fulminating platinum serves to extend the existing ana-
logies between the noble metals, and fills up a vacant space
in their ehemical history. In the present communication, I
Shall endeavour to describe this substance ; but before I enter
