liquid, undergo further alterations which entirely alter its nature.

In view of the above, it seems impossible to avoid the conclusion that the delay
in forming the symbiotic union, when the bacterium is added to an already advanced
culture of the yeast, is due to some difficulty which the Schizomycete meets with
in the altered medium. This difficulty might be one of the three following :â€”

Firstly, it might be simply due to the quantity of bacteria being so small that
time is needed for their multiplication in the medium, and for the development
of sufficient of the sheathed coils to fully entangle and embrace the large supply
of yeast-cells.

Secondly, it might be due to the fact that the yeast-cells are now in an exhausted
condition, whereas the Schizomycete only enters into symbiotic relations with active
yeast-cells.

Thirdly, it might be due to some inability on the part of the Schizomycete
to assimilate substances left in the medium by the yeast-cells.

I came to the conclusion that the first explanation is not the right one, because
similar delays were met with if I added larger quantities of the bacteria to such
yeast-cultures, and I could detect no correspondence between the time occupied in
effecting the symbiotic union, and the numbers of Schizomycetes added.

It is less easy to decide with respect to the second and third possibilities. The
