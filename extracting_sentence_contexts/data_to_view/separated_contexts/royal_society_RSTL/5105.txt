My. Lord,

Read Jan, 31, HE white boy, who was brought

1795. before this learned Society on
Thurſday laſt, came to me with his maſter on Sun-

to his being born of black parents, and find the fol-

black, and were both very young when landed; the
woman not being above {ixteen | years, old, and her
huſband not more than fix years older ; and when

mean, that ſhe was with child ſomething more than
fix moons, and that this was her firſt pregnancy. They alſo declared, that they had never ſeen a white
perſon before they came to the ſhore where Euro-
peans were employed in buying black flaves. The preſent owner of this boy is Mr.
