of 95%. We estimated a total sample size using G-Power software
(http: // www.gpower-hhu.de/). This estimation revealed a mini-
mum total sample size of n=26 (ie. N=13 participants for each
group). However, we included N=22  grapheme-colour
synaesthetes (19 female/3 male) between age 19 and 43 (31+8
years of age) and N = 22 gender-, education- and age-matched con-
trols into the study. Importantly, and as shown in the Results
section, the achieved power for the critical interaction of ‘Go
versus NoGo x non-veridical feature match x congruency x group’
in the ERP data was % = 0.637 ( f= 1.32) (refer to data analysis
of the N2 ERP component). Thus, the effect size observed in the
results is much stronger than that used to estimate necessary
sample size in our a priori calculations. In fact, the results show
that the assumption on which the effect size estimation is based
actually reflects a conservative estimate of effects. The empirical
data show that the obtained effect is much stronger.

Matched controls were selected from the general population
and screened with a questionnaire to ensure they did not experi-
ence grapheme-colour synaesthesia. We did not control for the
co-occurrence of potential other types of synaesthesia (such as
sequence-space synaesthesia) in our participants, because the
current task required responses to single-letter graphemes
rather than sequences of graphemes or words.
