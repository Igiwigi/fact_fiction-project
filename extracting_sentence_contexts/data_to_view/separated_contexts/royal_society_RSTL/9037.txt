Again, it will also be remembered that the diastolic

movements differ very much in the case of an ordinary locomotor contraction and in that of

a spaxm ; for while in the former case the process of relaxation is rapid even to sudden-

Seconds in its execution, and, from its slow but continuous nature, presenting a graceful
appearance. Lastly, the difference between the two kinds of contraction is shown by
the fact that, while a spasm is gradually passing off, the ordinary rhythmical contrac-
tions may often be sceen to be superimposed on it—both kinds of contraction being thus
present in the same tissue at the same time. (5) T have thus given a somewhat fuller description of these movements than that
contained in my former paper, because, as the whole of the present section is to be occu-
pied with their consideration, it seems desirable to render a complete account of them
at the outset. Now the point with which we shall be especially concerned on the pre-
sent occasion is one which has already been alluded to incidentally, viz.
