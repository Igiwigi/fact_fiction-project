It is worth adding that the presence of eSkin on large area brings new opportunities too. For
example, the large area could also be used to harvest energy (e.g. by integrating photovoltaic
cells on whole body) to power the sensors and electronics [25]. In fact, the development of
large area eSkin has revolutionized robotics by allowing new strategies based on simultaneous
multiple contacts, particularly in the unstructured environments or where vision is blocked
[2-4,11-14,24,32]. In unstructured environments, the complete world model is not available, and
robots have to plan and execute the tasks in the presence of environmental uncertainties. In such
