It is the magnetization,
so to speak, of an ideal perfect ferromagnetic, in which the controlling force that
resists the orientating action of the field is practically wholly derived from the
magnetic interaction of the neighbouring molecules, which for this purpose form
elastic systems, that is illustrated by Ewzne’s well-known model, which so clearly
represents the hysteresis accompanying ferromagnetic excitation. In ordinary
paramagnetic substances this mutual magnetic control of the molecules is insensible
compared with the control due to other molecular causes ; and our conclusion is that
these causes are such that the magnetic energy expended in working against them is
transformed into heat energy, not into internal energy of any regular elastic type. But we have not taken account of the fact that the molecules of every substance
are subject to both paramagnetic and diamagnetic influence, of which one or the
other preponderates. The theoretical law should thus be «= — B+ AT™! or
«xl = A—BT; so that in a diagram of the relation between «IT and T each
substance would be represented by a straight line.
