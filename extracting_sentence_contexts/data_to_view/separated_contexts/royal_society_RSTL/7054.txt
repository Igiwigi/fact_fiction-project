The photograms which
Fecord these changes are submitted to a very careful and exact process, by which the
gariations from a permanent zero, of the horizontal magnetic direction, and of the
mounts of the horizontal and vertical components of the Force, are measured and tabu-
ted at twenty-four equidistant intervals of an astronomical solar day. The accuracy
Af the tabulations is checked by a repetition of the process of measurement by different
Persons, and by a reexamination in cases of discrepancy. 'The proportion of failures in
the hourly records from any or from all causes whatsoever is very smallâ€”less in fact
than 1 per cent. throughout the whole period. 'The subjoined Table (No. I.) shows
that of 175344 positions which should have been recorded, there were only 1497
| failures, of which 103 were occasioned by the employment of the instruments in other
experimental processes.
