The author has previously shown that the magneton may be a constituent of
the diamagnetic hydrogen molecule. It appears that this idea may be extended to
carbon and the hydrocarbons in general, where the molecular susceptibility can be
directly calculated from the atomic susceptibilities of the component atoms. ~ The
results, however, are not so convincing when extended to other elements, but the fact
that departures from the additive law occur in such cases leads us to suppose that
some disturbing influence has been neglected. Wextssâ€™s work on salts of the ferro-
magnetic elements, taken in conjunction with our present conception of diamagnetism,
suggests that diamagnetic substances contain magnetons, compensated so as to
produce a diamagnetic effect of the medium in bulk. The forces of chemical
combination may, however, perturb this state, and by rearranging the magnetic elements
give rise to a compound possessing more magnetons than are contained in an unbalanced
state in a ferro-magnetic element.
