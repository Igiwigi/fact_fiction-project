and inwards and tend to overlap one another in echelon. These facts were patent
to both GunnincHaAM and EBERSTALLER, but not having the work of BRoDMANN to
guide them they could not be aware that this direction of the elements is the general
direction of the cortical areas of BRopMANN. CUNNINGHAM’s statement is as follows :
“In direction they are oblique, and the posterior end of each is placed on
the outer side of the anterior extremity of the one behind, whilst the other
extremity approaches close to the mesial border of the hemisphere. EBERSTALLER
has also observed this mode of arrangement of the complete pieces of the first
frontal furrow in those cases where its continuity is disturbed by the presence

of superficial annectant gyri.”

In virtue of the fact that the sulci on the medial surface of the frontal lobe are
more broken in the Australian aboriginal, it is of interest to classify the sulcus frontalis
superior in terms of confluence or separation of the elements. In this grouping the
element 11d is not considered.

Group 1

The sulcus frontalis superior is separated into three or more pieces by gyri connecting the
superior and middle frontal gyri.

Various combinations occur and it is not always possible to define the different
elements exactly.
