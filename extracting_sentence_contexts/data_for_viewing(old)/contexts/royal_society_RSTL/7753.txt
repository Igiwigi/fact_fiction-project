Q The $hell was then filled with water, and a waterproof fulminate-fuse was inserted
through the plug which closed the «hell. The fuse and each separate granule of the
explosive agent were therefore gurrounded by water. Upon ignition of the fuse, the
SZ «hell (which was placed in a very strong room) exploded with a violent report, and was
£ broken into very small fragments, the greater number of which were buried in the
BD timber which lined the cell.
S A similar shell was half filled with the same explosive agent; the spaces between the
.S granules and the empty portion of the shell were then filled with a thin plaster of Paris
2 mixture, and a fulminate-fuse was imbedded in the solid plaster which filled the upper
3 half of the shell. The explosion of the fuse was attended by a precisely similar result
to that obtained in the preceding experiment.
> It is believed that these experiments, together with the facts regarding the behayiour
2 of gun-cotton which have been stated in the earlier part of this paper, afford convincing
2 proof that the violent explosion of gun-cotton and nitroglycerine through the agency of
Z a detonating fuse must be ascribed either to the mechanical effect of that detonation
f (7.0. to the work done upon the particles more immediately exposed to the blow or con-
= cuxon of the detonation), or to the development of a disturbance of chemical equil-
S brium in the explosive agent by the suddenness and peculiar character of the concussion,
— or by the powerful vibrating impulse which the detonation establishes.
V The readiness and certainty with which gunpowder, gun-cotton, and other explosive
= 8ubstances may be detonated through the agency of a blow from a hammer or a falling
5 body, are regulated by several circumstances; they are in direct proportion to the weight
Q of the falling body, to the height of its fall, or the force with which it is impelled down-
wards, to the velocity of its motion, to the mass and rigidity, or hardness, of the support
