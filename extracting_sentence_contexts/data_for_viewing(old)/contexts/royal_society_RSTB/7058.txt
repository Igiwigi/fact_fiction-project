In the one case, a direct stimulus is applied to a proportion only of the organ, and in the
other case all, or the major part of the organ, is stimulated indirectly through its nerve
supply.

The constancy and gradation of the anti-diuretic response

If, during a water diuresis, a given stimulus was repeated after the anti-diuretic effect of
any previous stimulus had disappeared, the second response tended to be greater than the
first (see figure 5). This fact has been observed in a series of fourteen experiments on three
rabbits of group C. The first observations were made on rabbits under a sedative dose of
chloralose and urethane, and it was thought that the increasing effect of similar stimuli
was due to the decreasing level of anaesthesia as the experiments progressed. That this was
not the whole explanation was shown by the fact that in five later experiments the same
results were obtained without the use of any sedative. An alternative hypothesis is that the
same stimulus had a greater anti-diuretic effect as the water load of the animal decreased
(see Hart, Dâ€™Arcy & Verney 1934; Pickford 1936). However, in eleven experiments in
which additional water was given by stomach tube between consecutive stimuli, and time
allowed for absorption of this water, the response to the subsequent stimulus was diminished
to the previous level in one case only. 7
