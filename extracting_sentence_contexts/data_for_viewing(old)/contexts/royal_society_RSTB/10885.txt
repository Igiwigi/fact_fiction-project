we found age to be a clear modifier of survival probability,
with very high values of the CFR in young children (less
than 5 years; figure 2a), decreasing CFR with increasing age
to a minimum at around 15 years, and then increasing with
age to very high values in the elderly. While this effect has

been observed in other studies [4,7,10,20,30,31], the large
sample size available here gave a very clear picture of the
age dependence, which we fitted well with a simple two-
parameter model. The fact that despite obvious differences
in reporting practices between countries the age trends are
very similar across all three countries gives confidence that
this is in fact a real biological effect.

We also found differences in CFR between hospitalized
and non-hospitalized cases [11,12], with extremely high
CFRs of around 90% for those not hospitalized or of
unknown hospitalization status, and much lower values in
the range of 40 to 60% for hospitalized cases. Naively, this
could be interpreted as substantial benefit of clinical care.
However, the biases in both case and outcome reporting
are likely to result in lower CFR estimates in hospitalized
than non-hospitalized cases. In particular, follow up and
therefore reporting of the definitive clinical outcome were
likely less complete in the community setting, resulting in
