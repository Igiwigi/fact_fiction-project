ments, and the mode of using them, are fully described in the section on Meteorology,
and forming part of the * Manual of Scientific Inquiry ' published by authority of their
Lordships in 1849; the object being the determination of the proportion of the solar
heat absorbed by the atmosphere between the two limits of altitude. Should cireum-
stances permit, an intermediate station, about half-way up the mountain, would afford
valuable supplementary observations. Such observations, taken at the time of the 8wn
being vertical, would be very precious, but the series should be extended to every <p
tude of the 8un down to the horizon.

+ 2nd. It has been stated, that at a place considerably lower than the actual summit
of the Peak, there occur caverns on the mountain side, in which, though beneath the
limit of perpetual now proper to those latitudes, the temperature is always below the
freezing-point. The fact (which is not without analogous ones elsewhere) should be
inquired into, accurate observations made, and the concomitant circumstances carefully

* 3rd. The opportunity will of course not be lost of ascertaining by comparative
observations, with one and the same telescope, in England, at Orotava, and on the gum-
mit of the Peak, what degree of advantage, in point of optical performance, is obtained
by change of climate, and by ascent into a clearer and rarer atmosphere. The selection
of proper objects of comparison, such as nebulz, clusters, double stars, &c., must be left
to the observer's judgment.
