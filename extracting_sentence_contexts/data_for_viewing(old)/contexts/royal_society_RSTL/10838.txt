Suitable Starting point either in the positive part of the ascending branch of the main

Hb particular, it is unsymmetrical as regards susceptibility to magnetisation in the two
ongitudinal directions, being much more ready to take magnetism of an opposite 8ign

subsequently magnetised in one or the other direction.
$13. Residual Magnetism in Soft Tron.—A feature in these and other early experi-
ments which caused me much surprise was the largeness of the residual magnetism.
In fig. 1, 87 per cent., and in fig. 2, 81 per cent. of the total induced magnetism
remains when the magnetising force has been completely removed ; and in other
examples T have found the residual magnetism of soft iron to be 90 and even 93 per
cent. of the induced magnetism. Tt is generally stated in the best text-books that
the magnetic condition of soft iron disappears almost wholly when the inducing field
