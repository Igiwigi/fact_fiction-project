And if so, would non-realism in the spirit of Copenhagen also be
possible or necessary? Bohr thought so in the case of biology and, more tentatively, in psychology. In the case of biology, he argued as follows (emphasis added):

The existence of life must be considered as an elementary fact that cannot be explained, but =)
must be taken as a starting point in biology, ina similar way as the quantum of action, which :B
appears as an irrational element from the point of view of the classical mechanical physics, :
taken together with the existence of elementary particles, forms the foundation of atomic D8
physics. The asserted impossibility of a physical or chemical explanation of the function
peculiar to life would in this sense be analogous to the insufficiency of the mechanical : ~
analysis for the understanding of the stability of atoms. [53, p. 458] 2B

In other words, the ultimate nature of biological processes may be unrepresentable or even :S
inconceivable, and hence unavailable to realist mathematical models. Bohr’s invocation of ‘an
irrational element’ is of some interest, and I shall return to it below [4, pp. 17-18].
