I wish to express
my sincere thanks to Dr. E. J. ALLEN for his kind interest and the encouragement I
received from him throughout the work, and for the excellent facilities of the Plymouth
Laboratory which he placed at my disposal. My thanks are also due to Miss M. V.
Lezour who identified most of the diatoms I used, and to Dr. E. J. ALLEN, Dr. S. Kemp,
and Mr. F. S. RussELt who read the manuscript of this paper and made various correc-
tions and valuable suggestions for alterations. CULTURE METHODS

One of the reasons why the life history and physiology of the pennate diatoms is so
much better known than that of the Centricae may be found in the fact that the
former are more resistant and easier to culture than the latter. The classic work on
culture conditions for centric diatoms was done by Mique. (1892-7), ALLEN and
NELson (1910) and ALLEN (1914).
