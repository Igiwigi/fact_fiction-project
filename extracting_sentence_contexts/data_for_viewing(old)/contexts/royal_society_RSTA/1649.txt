The v — z phase diagrams displayed in figure 12 all show striking features, which are common Ss
to all models (even with the vastly different frequency resolution of the various models due to a
their different length): first, there is a dramatic difference between the subphotospheric layers 1S
(the convection zone) and the solar atmosphere above z = 0km (t5999 = 1) layer. Except for the
qs006023_t007 model (which has a different lower boundary condition), the subphotospheric
layers are dominated by ‘ridges’ of constant, strongly positive phase values (red features in
figure 12) on a background of only slightly positive phase values (green areas). We cannot offer
an explanation for this striking behaviour yet, merely some speculative ideas: assuming that
the sound waves are created near the upper boundary of the convection zone, one would have
expected a similar behaviour as in the atmosphere, just with the opposite sign, i.e. downward
propagating acoustic waves, showing up as positive phase differences, increasing with frequency
(from green over yellow to red). The fact that we see phase ‘ridges’ suggests an interference
pattern, possibly caused by the reflection of the downward propagating sound waves at the
lower boundary. These ‘ridges’ may therefore be related to the pseudo-modes [33] observed in
the atmosphere (see also figure 11, where the modal structure of the p-modes can be followed
beyond the acoustic cutoff frequency of about 5.5 mHz). These high-frequency pseudo-modes are
caused by the interference of waves coming directly from the source and those being reflected
in the solar interior [33]. While acoustic waves with frequencies below the cutoff frequency are
completely reflected by the surface layers and thus being trapped in the interior forming a pattern
of standing waves, waves with frequencies above the cutoff frequency can escape into the solar
atmosphere. Clearly, this finding requires further study, supported by focused modelling efforts.

In the atmosphere (z > 0 km), we see in large parts the expected behaviour: green and red areas
at the lowest frequencies in the gravity wave regime, followed by a transition into propagating
