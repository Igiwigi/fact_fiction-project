the new coefficient bz transforms as an ordinary differential:
b2(@) da = bo(a) da,

while c2(a) continues to transform as an projective connection (up to a constant). The proof is
again straightforward. We may adapt the above to the Green function G(z,a) = G*(z), despite the fact that it is not
harmonic in z (because of the compensating background flow). First we write

G(z,a)= = (-los |z—a| + H(¢,a)) (5.1)

and then expand the regular part as
H(Z,a) = ho(a) + sllnlane —a)+h@@ 4)

The coefficient ho(a) is one example of a Robin function, more precisely a coordinate Robin
function. The distance |z —a| to the singularity is here measured using a coordinate chart, this
