authors of the early neurotransmitter hypotheses of tempera-
ment for their bravery, even though our own (FET) model
[36,37] might be different from them. The results, which were
reported in this volume, support the FET suggestion that the
functional role of MA systems is probably not in the regulation
of emotionality (considering the inconsistency of the associ-
ations of MA with neuroticism and reward-dependence)

[22,25]. This important negative result is worth exploring. The
FET model highlights findings in neurochemistry, suggesting
that DA systems prioritize and update behavioural pro-
grammes, whereas 5-HT maintains the available alternatives.
In fact, Netterâ€™s [25] studies of the reaction time (i.e. timing of
integration of actions) reported a slow-down universally in
both extra- and introverts when a DA antagonist is used.
Moreover, when only DA (and not 5-HT) systems were
compromised in experiments of Robbins [23], Netter [25] and
Dellu-Hagedorn et al. [26], an individual could not prioritize be-
havioural alternatives into situation-adequate actions, but still
was able to maintain previous sets of programmes; this results
in rigidity and perseveration around the same acts. When a
deficiency in 5-HT was added to disturbances in DA release,
a low turn-over of the DA led to high impulsivity [23,26].
This is interpreted by the FET as compromised maintenance
of the established behavioural alternatives: without a proper
