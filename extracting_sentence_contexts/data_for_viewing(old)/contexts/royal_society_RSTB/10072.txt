notable exception is presented by Han ef al. [51], who found
significant correlations between total and pathogenic
V. parahaemolyticus in oysters, despite a ratio between the two
that varied widely. However, most pathogenic strains in that
study were obtained from Chinese markets, rather than
directly from the environment, and the authors remark that
handling practices could alter pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus
levels [51].

Although it seems obvious to link water quality with oyster
quality, most studies that examine environmental effects on
V. vulnificus or V. parahaemolyticus find less variation in the
water column than in oysters. In fact, it is not uncommon for
bacterial concentrations inside oysters to be quite different
from the water that they were harvested from, even when
sampling is tightly controlled temporally and_ spatially
[26,31]. Furthermore, variation in Vibrio concentrations from
oyster to oyster can be orders of magnitude, even when oysters
are collected from the exact same clutch. It seems that while
Vibrio spp. in the water column react quickly to changing con-
ditions, once they colonize the interior of the oysters they
remain relatively stable. It is hypothesized that the Vibrio colo-
nization of oysters occurs at the larval settlement stage, and
exogenous bacteria in adult oysters are merely transient [59].
