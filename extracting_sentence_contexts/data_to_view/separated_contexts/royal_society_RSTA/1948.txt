The method may be illustrated by an
example from KrS. In Kr, e = 3183°35. The value of §, (5) as calculated from the
formula is 47419°39, which is in the ultra-violet outside the observed region, But
47419'39—e = 4423604. This is within the observed region, and as a fact the
corresponding line is found at 44237°61 with dA = —'08 if e is free from error. As
an individual case this might be due to a coincidence, but when the same effect occurs
with line after line the cumulative effect becomes convincing. To see this it is
necessary to get at a glance a survey of all the cases, and for this purpose they are
exhibited in sets of diagrams in Plate 3.
