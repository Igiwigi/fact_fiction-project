The growth of these spicula in their early stages is probably very rapid, as the num-
fr of those in the first and second stages is remarkably small as compared with those
S the third and subsequent stages. S In the inequi-birotulate spicula of Spongilla paulula, BowERBANK, MS., we find a
_ _ of radial canals passing from each end of the central cavity of the shaft to the
Streme circumference of the rotulz; and it is therefore probable that this expanded
gurt of the spiculum is 8imilar in character to that of the folio-peltate spiculum which
E have described page 299, in treating of the spicula, of the membranes ; and that they
Ve, in fact, originally composed of a series of terminal radial spicula expanding and
@alescing laterally, and thus forming one plane circular surface in place of numerous
parate radii (Plate XXVI. fig. 32). Z BIROTULATE : MARGINS OF THE ROTULE ENTIRE (Plate XXVI.
