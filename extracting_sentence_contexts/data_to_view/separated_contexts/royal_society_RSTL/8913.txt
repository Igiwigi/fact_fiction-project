BAYLEY BALFOUR. 317

- In Vaseular Cryptogams, the Rodriguez Flora contrasts yery unfayourably with
that of the other Mascarene Islands. The 25 species known, of which 20 are Ferns,
is a number relatively and absolutely yery 8mall. The scarcity of this group of
plants is accounted for by the dryness of the island, and in confirmation of this
fact, we obserye the Tree Ferns of the other Mascarene Islands haye here no repre-
sentatives, and of the large moisture loying genera Trichomanes and Iymenophyllum,
80 abundant elsewhere in the group, the former is here typified in one species only,
T. enspidatum, whilst the latter is absent. And when we consider the nature of

- the $pecies which do oceur, they are those characteristic of dry and arid regions,
such for example as Adiantum caudatum, Asplenium furcatum, Asplenium falcatum,
Nephrodium unitum, N. molle, Polypodium phymatodes, Nephrolepis acute. Q None of the species are novelties ; all occur in the Mascarene Islands, and three
of them, Trichomanes eugpidatum, Davallia mauritiana, and Neplrodium erinitum,
peculiarly Mascarene, but most are widely spread tropical species.
