In an ordinary shell which rotates upon a
Horizontal axis, the alternate compression and rarefaction of the air at the month of the
fuse, although tending to compensate each other, will still leave a considerable balance
of compression, which must cause a marked retardation in the rate of burning. The apparently opposite conclusions to which we are led as regards the influence of
atmospheric pressure upon the rate of combustion, by the experiments upon candles
on the one hand and upon time-fuses on the other, are by no means irreconcileable; mn

fact, an examination into the conditions of combustion in the two cases scarcely leaves
- room for the expectation of any other result. In the combustion of a candle, the radiant heat from the flame first melts the com-
7 bustible matter in the capsule at the base of the exposed portion of the wick ; the
- capillary action of the latter then elevates the liquefied wax, tallow, or spermaceti into
the upper part of the wick, where it is exposed to a temperature which effects its volati-
tzation and decomposition. It is thus evident that the rate of combustion, or at all events
therate of consumption of the combustible matter of the candle, is entirely dependent upon
the capillarity of the wick, provided that the radiant heat from the flame is sufficient to
keep up a supply of liquefied combustible matter at the base of the wick, and that the
Atemperature of the flame is high enough to volatilize this matter on its arrival near the
Spe of the cotton.
