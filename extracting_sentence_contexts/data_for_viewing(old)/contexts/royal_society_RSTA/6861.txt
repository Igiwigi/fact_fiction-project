outside the experimental errors, and it is therefore considered likely that, for the experiments
using the tube of radius 3-45 cm. at least, the energy introduced can be neglected.

The volume of water in the tank was always at least 400 times that of the column and, as
a further precaution, no readings for the surge motion were taken when it was close to the
walls of the tank. It is difficult to be sure that these precautions prevented the finite bulk
of the water in the tank from influencing the results obtained but no increase in energy
dissipation with increasing volume of the column was observed at any time.

5. QUALITATIVE CONSIDERATIONS OF THE COLLAPSE OF A COLUMN

The shape of the collapsing column would be influenced by energy introduced in raising
the tube, but for the reasons given above and also because of the fact that in all the experi-
ments with density differences varying over the range 0-00014<p,â€”p,<0-75 the same
sequence of shapes occurred, it seems probable that the fall of an undisturbed column
follows a similar shape sequence to that shown in figure 2, plate 4, in which is also shown
a general view of the surge shortly after the column has collapsed. It is perhaps of interest
to notice that the diameter of the top of the column; in the latest of our photographs in
which the column can be seen above the surge, is approximately three-quarters of the initial
value. In The effects of atomic weapons, p. 104, it is stated that the diameter of the Bikini
column of 450 ft. above sea level decreased from 2050 to 1500 ft. between 15 and 33sec.
after the explosion, by which latter time the main column of water droplet laden air had
collapsed, leaving only a tenuous mist which had been drawn down behind it.
