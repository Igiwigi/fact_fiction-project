especially the latter's) experiments brought to our knowledge peculiar facts, which
all seemed to indicate that the above phenomena are surface phenomena, and strongly
to oppose the author's conception of such systems as galvanic cells. What were now
these observations of BecqueREL and Mincuin? According to BrcquerEeL: “ by
depositing on one of the Ag plates a thin layer of iodide, obtained by the action of
the vapour of iodine at the ordinary temperature and then exposing this plate to
light, it was found that it took positive electricity from the liquid. With a thick
layer of iodine on the surface of the Ag, there is on the contrary a current the
inverse of the proceeding, ¢.c., the plate exposed to light*took negative electricity ” ;
further, “ whilst with precipitated chloride and bromide of silver placed on plates of
platinum there is always produced a current of the same sense, the exposed plate
being positive ; with a layer deposited on Ag there is an effect depending upon the
thickness of this layer.” ‘These two inverse facts indicate that there should
necessarily be a thickness of layer for which the electric effect is almost nothing ”
(‘La Lumiére, vol. IL, p. 129). Mrycuin again observes (‘ Phil. Mag., 1891,
XXXL, p. 207) with AgCl, AgBr in collodion an E.M.F. in the opposite direction to
that of AgI in gelatine (p. 200). E

The observations of Mincuin with metallic plates seem to be still more inexplicable.
He tells us of “a very curious case on inversion of the current produced by light
observed with silver plates immersed in water containing eosine in solution (p. 211),
or in aleohol containing naphthalene red (p. 212); the E.M.F. is sometime in one, at
others in the opposite direction.” He made the same observation with “ bismuth in
water” (p. 213). In “ nearly every cell used with tin plates the exposed plate
was positive to the unexposed; but after a time, varying from a few minutes to a
