and

My = 20 R(1/k) — Hos

then the region (1-2) consists of the whole plane and we can determine the expansion
of f(x) for all large x. We have always “<4 and 27 #(1/x) —4<4n, so the sector
(1-1) still lies within the half-plane #(xt) > K; in fact, the angle of the sector is

My +My = 27 R(1/k) <7. Hence when A&(1/x) <4 we can deduce all the results of Wright (1940) from hypotheses
substantially less than those of that paper. Since I now prove part of my former results under wider conditions, it is natural to
ask whether the present results are in some sense ‘best possible’.
