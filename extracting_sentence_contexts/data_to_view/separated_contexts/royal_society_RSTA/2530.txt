(0-056 R) as accurate to within about 5 per cent. The fact that this mean value of the depth below the surface is not very different from
the mean estimate of the depth below normal makes it quite certain that normal earth-
quakes must originate within a few tens of kilometres below the surface. The depth of the focus in relation to the magnitudes of the surface and upper crustal
features may be visualised from fig. 6.
