The next molar is similar. The last is likewise bilophodont, but has also a large tuberculate talon. The relatively primitive character of M@ritherium is shown by the fact that the
skull presents no very striking peculiarities beyond the forward extension of the
maxille and the great thickness of the cranial bones. In the mandible the
massive symphysis is little elongated. In the upper jaw only one tooth (Pm. 1) of
the full Eutherian dentition is wanting ; in the mandible three (I. 3, C. and Pm. 1)
have been lost.
