Post Ruskin, Oscar Wilde in The Decay Of Lying (1889) [42] satirized Ruskin by suggesting that the

VIVIAN. ... All that I desire to point out is the general principle that Life imitates Art far
more than Art imitates Life, and I feel sure that if you think seriously about it you will
find that it is true. Life holds the mirror up to Art, and either reproduces some strange
type imagined by painter or sculptor, or realizes in fact what has been dreamed in fiction. Scientifically speaking, the basis of life—the energy of life, as Aristotle would call it—is
simply the desire for expression, and Art is always presenting various forms through which
this expression can be attained. Life seizes on them and uses them, even if they be to her
own hurt.
