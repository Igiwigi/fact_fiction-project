This should, of course, also affect the electric

currents which arise from the lunar atmospheric tide, and so make the lunar magnetic
Svariations depend on the sun as well as on the moon. In the course of a lunation,
phowever, the angle between the sun and moon, viewed from the earth, changes from
§0 to 27, and the mean lunar variation for such a period cannot be expected to show
‘Sany special dependence on solar time. At any particular lunar phase, however, the
solar day hours, during which (over a given part of the earth) the atmospheric
~conductivity is greatest, occur at a definite part of the lunar day, this part changing
with the lunar phase; and it has, in fact, been found* that the lunar variation
Sdetermined from the mean of a number of days all at the same lunar phase is not of
the semi-diurnal form. The variation curve goes through a regular cycle of change
‘2with lunar phase, in such a manner as to leave the mean variation over a whole
‘Blunation of the simple form already described. The magnetic needle is
