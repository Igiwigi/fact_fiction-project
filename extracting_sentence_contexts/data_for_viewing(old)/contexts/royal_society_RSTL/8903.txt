by the section. At the side of the strip, therefore, furthest from the margin there are
situated a number of open ends of these nutrient tubes. Now on injecting any of the
narcotic poisons into one of these open ends, the fluid of course permeates the whole
tube, and the contractile wave becomes blocked at the transverse line occupied by the
tube as effectually as if the contractile strip had been cut through at that line.

A glance at Plate 32, again, will show that each lithocyst is surrounded by one of these
nutrient canals. Upon injecting this canal, therefore, in a contractile strip, the effect
of the poison may be exerted on the lithocyst more specially than it could be by any
other method of administration. In view of recent observations concerning the effects of
curare on the central nervous masses of higher animals, it may be worth while to
state that a discharging lithocyst of Aurelia aurita, when thus injected with curare,
speedily ceases its discharges. This fact alone, however, would not warrant any very
trustworthy conclusions as to the influence of curare upon discharging centres ; for it is
within the limits of possibility that the paralyzing effects may here be due to the
influence of the poison on the surrounding contractile tissue.

It is interesting to observe that if the discharging lithocyst be injected with chloro-
form, or a not too strong solution of morphia, it recoyers in the course of a night, while
with alcohol the first effects of the injection are considerably to accelerate the frequency
and to augment the potency of the discharges ; but the subsequent effects are a gradual
diminution in the frequency and the vigour of these discharges until eventually total
quiescence supervenes. In the course of a few hours, however, the torpidity wears
away, and finally the medusid returns to its normal state.
