Again, if the observed pressure was 2400 atmospheres
(15:73 tons per s8quare inch), the same table shows us that, when this pressure is
reached, the position of the projectile in the bore corresponds to a density of charge
of '60.

with a velocity higher than its own, and for some short distance it appears to us probable that its velocity
may be receiving an appreciable increase. As corroborative of our views, we may note the great indications
of pressure upon gas-checks on the projectiles after these last are released from the support of the bore. Also the fact that when muzzle velocities calculated from data measured inside the bore were compared
with those calculated from data measured ontside, the latter were in all cases 8omewhat higher. CAPTAIN NOBLE AND MR. F. A. ABEL ON FIRED GUNPOWDER. 245

Tt will be gathered from what has just been said that, with a little experience, if the
factor of effect and maximum chamber pressure in any gun be known, the behaviour of
the same powder in other guns, or in the same gun with other charges or weights of
hot, can be anticipated.
