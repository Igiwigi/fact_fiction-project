That this
was not a safe procedure is shown from the fact that one of his experiments had to
be rejected on account of confluent reunion. Sreranrâ€™s experiments were not followed by a perfect use of the limb by the
animal, permanent flexion developing in all in which the crossing had been effective. This is to be explained by the fact that he crossed in them the musculo-spiral
with the median only, leaving the ulnar nerve intact. A method of this kind
leaves one nerve to supply the flexors as before, while the whole supply of the
extensors has to be carried on through the crossed nerve. The balance of opposing
action of the two groups is thus disturbed, and the flexors are more than likely in
the course of the experiment to exhibit a preponderance of action.
