strength of the arguments against Wepmr’s theory which we have previously urged,
and cinnot but regard as fatal to it,

(e.) Even if the admission be made that the air-bladder and its ossicles are
accessory to hearing, the Fish could have no power of appreciating the direction of |
sounds conyeyed to the internal ear by such means. Aty cognizance of the varying
directions from which sounds may come is generally believed to be due in all
vertebrated animals to the differential action of the two ears, but we have already
shown* that no such action can possibly take place in response to impulses received
through the Weberian mechanism in accordance with Weeen's theory. Tt would,
therefore, seem that any increased acuteness of hearing that might be conferred on
the Fish by the air-bladder in its presumptive function as an accessory to audition,
would be counterbalanced by the fact that such increase of auditory capacity could
not be associated with a corresponding increase i the power of appreciating the
direction of sounds, Whatever may be the physiologies| importance of the sense of
hearing in Fishes, whether associated with the pursuit of prey, or as an aid in
escaping from enemies, or, a8 in the case of gregarious Fishes, as a means of keeping
together in shoals for breeding or other purposes, the power of appreciating the
direction of sounds must be of primary importance in any modification of the auditory
organ in the direction of giving to its possessor exceptional powers of hearing.

(2.) Contrary to what might fairly be expected if so complicated a structure as the
Weberian mechanism is an accessory to heaving, there is absolutely no evidence of the
existence of exceptional powers of hearing either in the Siluridse or any other
Ostariophysem.

(3.) Finally, it nay be stirmed that there is an alternative view of the fonction of
the Weberian ossicles, whieli is in perfect harmony with the facts of structure, and is
open to none of the objections which can be reasonably tirged against Werner's theory,
and also, at the same time, has an important beating on the locomotor activities of
the Fishes concerned. With the reservation which the entire absence of direct experimental evidence
renders absolutely necessary, it may be affirmed that the arguments set forth im the
preceding paragraphs are distinctly adverse to the theory that the Weberian ossicles
are in any way related to the function of andition, even to the subordinate and
qualified extent tacibly suggested by Hasse and Ramsay Waren; and the solution
of this dificult problem must be looked for in some other direction,

Dismissing sound production, equilibration or orientation, respiration and audition
from all physiological connection with the Weberian ossicles, we may now consider
the sola remaining alternative view—that the ossicles are accessory to the hydrostatic

function of the air-bladder. But before dealing with this aspect of the problem it
will be advisable to state what is actually and experimentally known asto the bydro-
static function of the air-bladder in Fishes in general.

ON THR ANATOMY OF FISHES. 277

One of the earliest theories of the hydrostatic fiction of the aimbladdew with which
“we are uequainted is that propounded by Borznrr in 1685, According to his theory
Vhe fuvetion of the ni-bladder, in its mean condition, is to render the specific pvayvity
of te Fish eqaal to thaf of the water in which if lives, and also nid the Fish in its
jooyements of ascent and descent in the water, sach movements being due either to
4n increase in the specific gravity of the aniotal as the result of museular compression
of the air-bladder, or to the diminished specific gravity which would resnlt from
muscular relaxation and the consequent expansion of the eontained gases.* From
the time of Borects until the publication of the results of Mongac's experimental

Stosearches in 1976, the function of the air-bladder proved a frnitti source of disenssion
pimong zoologists and comparative pliysiologists, among whom the names of DEeLa-
“eRanHE, Cuvir, Staxnrus, Goverer, Owey, Bror, Moxynoyen, and Jowannes
Minn may be mentioned.
