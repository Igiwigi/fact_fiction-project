that degeneration of the mucosa is due to the denudation process ; in my
ations degenerated tissue is undoubtedly present before denudation takes place.
NSTONE (29) describes the mucosa of the menstruating uterus as similar to
f the non-menstruating organ, except that the epithelium is cast off and washed
He considers the material used by Witttams to be unsatisfactory, and
@ ces AVELING’S observations as entirely erroneous. He believes the growth of
Sorpuscular element of the mucosa (“endometrium ”) is continually going on by
fis of the gradual growth of the granular elements contained in the “ sustentacular
Heads,” and not by division of the cells themselves ; and that the products of this
oth in the non-pregnant uterus are washed away by the menstrual flow. I cannot
Kebver that Jounsrone presents sufficient evidence to render his views of the
‘ation of cells de novo at all probable: and his description of the “ continual ”
h of the mucosa is probably due to the fact that he has not seen menstruating
throughout the whole of the denudation period.
cu (53) finds the upper surface of the mucosa is almost entirely cast
He considers the cause of menstrual bleeding to be venous congestion, brought
by the compression of the veins in the muscular wall of the uterus, and the
eseape of blood to be derived from the capillaries within the mucosa by
esis, and from those on the surface by rupture. In contradistinction to WYDER,
Acu believes that a formation of decidual tissue does take place. (See also
ww (19), and Levy (40)).
KTIsToOwW (13) believes there is no doubt that fatty degeneration may appear
menstruating mucosa, and that there may be a loss of uterine epithelium, but
f® menstrual bleeding he considers an inconstant and immaterial symptom.
 Kanupen (30) says that in all probability the whole of the epithelium of the
