The study was commissioned
by an energy company and the tsunami consultant was a major European laboratory, very
experienced in coastal engineering studies. One wonders whether this was their first design
study with tsunamis, given that their estimate for the inland flooding level was 1m, yet they
have used as an initial condition the AD 365 event, whose tsunami is known to have destroyed
most of Alexandria. In fact, Alexandria disappeared as one of the centres of the meta-ancient
world following this event. The well known laboratory signed off on what was a Fukushima-
size underestimation of the hazard. The energy company was itself surprised at the finding and
solicited an external review.
