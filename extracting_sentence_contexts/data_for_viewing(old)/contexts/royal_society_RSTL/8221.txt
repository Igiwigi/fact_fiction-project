! VI. Appearances under Polarized Light.

Although at first sight it may seem an easy matter to determine which parts of a
 muscular fibre are singly and which doubly refracting, yet, in fact (owing no doubt
principally to the complex optical conditions which are produced by the heterogeneity
of the structures through which the light has to pass), there is hardly any subject in
 histology in which greater difficulty occurs in arriving at a correct result. Accordingly
gearcely any two observers who have carefully investigated living muscular fibre with

is object have arrived at precisely the same conclusion. One of the chief difficulties

that of obtaining the muscular fibres in a sufficiently isolated state ; for the addition

any fluid is quite inadmissible, and without such addition isvlation of the individual
Eres is liable to be accompanied by desiccation and loss of the normal structural
#pearances. Of course the presence of other fibres under or over the particular one
