It is important to point out that we are : s
discussing the quenched variance, that is variance for typical realization of the random potential. :3
The linear in Â¢ growth of the variance after averaging with respect to the disorder was understood :F
for a long time [11,12]. Such growth is due to a contribution of the non-typical random potentials ia
which have small probability, but whose contribution to the averaged (annealed) variance is large. : =
Surprisingly, our numerical results suggest that in fact the variance grows as t > oo even for : =
typical realization of the random potential. 13

The numerical results are presented in the next two sections. In fact, we study the problem : =
in a discrete setting. While the exact meaning of the hydrodynamics equations in this case is DR
not obvious, the discrete case provides the most natural model for studying the localization aieel
phenomenon for directed polymers. Also, in the discrete setting one can naturally define partition :8
functions which can be viewed as solutions to the discrete SHE.
