zinc, copper, lead, silver, &c., are attacked by certain acids which do not attack the
gold itself. * This fact led us to hope that the use of suitable reagents would afford
useful data. Pure nitric acid (spec. grav. 1°33) was without action in the case of twelve
of the specimens which were subjected to its action for five minutes at a temperature
close to its boiling point, but it developed, on the section of the alloy with indium, a
network of either dotted or continuous lines, to which we shall again refer after we
have described the results of a general attack by aqua regia.
