logical studies have shown that this situation occurs in some
species that have formerly been thought to reproduce by

mitotic asexuality (e.g. [36]). Finally, some species that regu-
larly reproduce by central fusion automixis do so with low to
very low levels of recombination, thus maintaining maternal
heterozygosity to a large degree [29,34,37-39], although
strong selection against recombinants, such as found during
automictic reproduction in the Cape honeybee [40-42],
may also contribute to low observed recombination rates in
some of these cases.

The fact that at least some asexuals have low recombination
rates, much lower than typically seen in sexual species, has
several puzzling implications. First, itis possible that recombina-
tion rate rapidly evolves to much reduced levels following the
transition to asexuality. However, this poses a problem: Given
that many asexual organisms, and automicts in particular, still
segregate chromosomes during meiosis I, how could recombina-
tion be rapidly reduced if one obligate CO is required for proper
disjunction? Even if many extant asexual organisms probably do
not segregate homologues during meiosis I (e.g. suppressed or
aborted meiosis I), which may reduce this constraint, normal
segregation probably still occurred in many cases immediately
following the transition [2,25,26]. Second, it has been suggested
