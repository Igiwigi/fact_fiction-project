This arises from the in-
creased velocity, as well as friction of each due to lateral compression. 8th. The
veined structure invariably tends to disappear when a glacier becomes $0 crevassed
as to lose horizontal cohesion, as when it is divided into pyramidal masses. Now
this immediately follows from our theory ; for as s00n as lateral cohesion is destroyed,
any determinate inequality of motion ceases; each mass moves singly, and the
structure disappears very gradually#*.‚Äù

In explaining the theory of the veined structure at a meeting of the Royal Society
of Edinburgh on the 20th of March 1843, I stated that T had arrived at the conclu-
sion that crevasses resulting from tension in certain parts of a glacier, must be
formed at right angles to the surfaces of discontinuity or structural veins where they
intersect the surface: a law conformable to the empirical one discovered by me on
the glacier of the Rhone in 1841+, since generalized in other cases, and which even
the adversaries of my theoretical views have admitted to be a correct statement of
the facts *. My attention was at that time (March 1843) turned by my learned and acute
friend Mr. W.
