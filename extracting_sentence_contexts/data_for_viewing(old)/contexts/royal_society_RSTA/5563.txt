understood. It is probably related to the fact that the particles are flow tumbling if § < €* and
flow aligning if & > &*, where &* =3S/(S + 2). Thus, for the MP model &* = 0.43 and, while for
the MC model, &* = 0.51 since y = 2.8 and Sy =0.41. However, even in passive nematics flow
alignment may lead to non-trivial effects [23] and how it affects the interfacial anchoring of active
nematics is beyond the scope of this work.

5. Two dimensions

(a) Flat interface

We proceed to analyse the effect of perturbations on the interfacial anchoring at higher activities,
in particular the stability of the flat interface. As reported in §4, the effect of the elastic anisotropy
on the interfacial anchoring is only observed at very low activities. The activities ¢ considered in
