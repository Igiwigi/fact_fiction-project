M. ProvsT,* who first

paid attention to its properties, supposes that it is a compound
of the acid with tannin: but I suspect that it also contains
gallic acid, and probably a small portion of extractive matter. * The fact of the precipitation of solution of galls by acids, was noticed by M.
D1ze', See Annales de Chimie, Tome XXXV. p. 37,



on the constituent Parts of astringent Vegetables. 941

"This last substance, as is well known, is thrown down from its
solutions by sulphuric acid; and I found, in distilling the pre-
cipitate from galls by sulphuric acid, at a heat above 212", that
a fluid came over, of a light yellow colour, which was ren-
dered black by oxygenated sulphate of iron; but which was not
altered by gelatine.
