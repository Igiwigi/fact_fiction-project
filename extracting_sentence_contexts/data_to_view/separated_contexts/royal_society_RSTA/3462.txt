at is impossible to obtain with this method two exactly similar mixtures, and the

ffects of small changes in the composition of the mixture are large. If an excess of
Bhlorine be present in the mixture, the results with different tubes are fairly
yeomparable, much more consistent results being obtainable than with an excess of
shydrogen. This fact agrees with BuNsEN and Roscor’s result, that a small excess of
Shydrogen makes a very much greater difference in the rate of combination than that
Bbroduced by the same excess of chlorine,
e The effect of insolating the chlorine alone passes off if the chlorine and hydrogen
“Anixture be left in the dark for some time. The behaviour is then similar to that of
‘She ordinary insolated mixture.
