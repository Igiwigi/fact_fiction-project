Hoapiey’s experiments tested competence in our sense, but with
reference to a series of processes which was, in different cases, halted at different stages. Hoap.ey argues as if the stage attained in this series was a direct measurement of the
potentiality with which the processes were started in the first place, so that he could say
that in one case the tissue was isolated when it had a definite potentiality to form primi-
tive epidermis, and in another case when it was capable of differentiating to brain. But it is probable that the tissue when isolated was, in fact, non-competent with regard
to the later processes of differentiation which it finally performed. In such a series of
processes it is probable that the later members are dependent on the harmonious
(spatial or otherwise) realisation of the earlier. It is thus possible that Hoapiey’s
older explants differentiated further than the young, not only because they were com-
petent for further stages of differentiation but also partly because they were more
competent for the earlier stages and thus performed them more harmoniously.
