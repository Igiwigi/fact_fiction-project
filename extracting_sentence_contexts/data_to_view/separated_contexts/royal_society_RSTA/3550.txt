quadratures are inappropriate for these integrations, because the function, say U,, to
be integrated increases so very rapidly. I therefore take an empirical and integrable
function, say v,, which is such that 0,5 = wo, Yj, = %,; the quadratures may then be
applied to w%,—v,, and the result applied as a correction to [vd In fact this
correction is always very small, and we might well be satisfied to use |v dy, which is
very easy to calculate. The empirical function v is given by
