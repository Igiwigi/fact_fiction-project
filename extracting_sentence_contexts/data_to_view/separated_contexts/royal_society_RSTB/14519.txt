The first is to point out that
there are in fact many ways in which natural languages adapt
through cultural evolution to the interactional niche, certainly
more than normally meet the linguistâ€™s eye. This section
spells those out. The second is to sketch how in fact the
very core of language structure may owe its origin to the mul-
timodal niche in which language most likely evolved, which . sae .

It is possible to make quite a list of features of linguistic There is a long tradition in the analysis of language, often

In addition, as pointed out in [35], syntactic dependencies
can hold across turns, as when one speaker completes the
utterance of another. There are many properties of the use of language that are tai-
