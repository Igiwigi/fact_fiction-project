A comparison of BuxsEN and SCHISCHKOPP'S results with those shortly afterwards
obtained by Lixck in BuxsEN's laboratory, the same method being pursued for effecting
the decomposition of the powder, appears to demonstrate this conclusively. The differences in the composition of the powders operated upon in the two investi-
gations would certainly not snffice to account for the important differences exhibited by
the results of analysis of the residues. The comparatively large proportion of potassium
sulphide, the much larger proportion of hyposulphite, and the considerably smaller pro-
portion of sulphate found by Lixck appear to indicate that the operation of burning
the powder was conducted much more rapidly by him, a view which is supported by the
fact that, while he found a considerable proportion of ammonium carbonate in the
residue, none existed in the product obtained by Buxsen and SculsCHKOPP, who, however,
found this constituent in the 80-called poyder-smoke which they collected in a long tube
through which the gas escaped. Our experiments haye demonstrated conclusively that, eyen when the conditions under
which the explosion of powder is effected in distinct operations are as closely alike as
possible, yery exceptional results, as regards the compoxition of the solid residue, may
be obtained, experiments 7 & 17, 9 & 4, 14 & 70 being illustrations of this. Yet in no
instance, howeyer apparently abnormal, did any considerable proportion of potassium
nitrate escape decompoxsition, the highest amounts discovered in the residues being 0:48
and 0-56 per cent. (experiments 1 & 8).
