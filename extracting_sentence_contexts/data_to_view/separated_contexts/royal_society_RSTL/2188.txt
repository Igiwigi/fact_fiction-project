Preliminary observations on the analysis of organised substances. Vegetable substances contain at least two elements, hy-
drogen and carbon ; and most generally three, hydrogen,
carbon, and oxygen. Animal substances are still more com-
plicated ; and besides the above three, usually involve a
fourth element, namely, azote, to which they appear to owe
many of their peculiar properties. - These general facts have
been known ever since the elements themselves have been
recognised as distinct principles, though the determination of
the exact proportions in which they enter into any particu-
lar substance, has always proved a most difficult problem. To enumerate all that has been done on this subject would
be loss of time ; and it need only be mentioned, that all idea
' of separating the different elements from one another, s0 as
to obtain them perse, has been long since abandoned, if indeed

it was ever entertained, and the general principle on which
the analysis of organic products has been usually conducted,
has been to obtain their elements in the form of binary comÂ»
pounds, either by destructive distillation, as was formerly
practised ; or by combining the elements with some other
element with which they possessed the property of forming
definite binary compounds, from the quantity and known
composition of which, those of the original elements might
be readily obtained by calculation.
