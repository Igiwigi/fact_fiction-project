In this respect, therefore, T'’mesipteris quickly passes over during its

ontogeny a feature which was permanent in the Rhyniacew.

(d) Sporangiophores. The anatomical resemblances between the Psilophytales and the Psilotales are accom-
panied, as Krpston and LANG have shown, by a general agreement in the sporangiferous
organs. In the fossil group the sporangia are clearly terminal on shoots, but it is possible
to interpret in the same way the clustered sporangia (synangia) of the Psilotaces,
especially as we know that in the Rhyniacez the branching of the sporangiferous axis
was sometimes shared by the sporangium itself.+ The sterile leaf-like lobes of the
Psilotacez, identical in structure and appearance with the vegetative leaves, would be
strictly homologous with them, but whatever their exact morphological nature may be.t
it would not affect the general conclusion that the organ on which they are borne is of
an axial and not foliar nature.§ The fact that the vascular supply to a sporangiophore
originates in the same way as an ordinary leaf-trace, while going in support of the foliar
theory, is not inconsistent with an axial nature of the organ. The usual presence of a
pair of leaves on the sporangiferous axis was largely responsible for the comparison with
the forked sporophylls of the Sphenophyllales, but the Rhynie discoveries have shown
that this comparison, though fully justified on the evidence then available, was probably
based on a superficial resemblance. Before concluding, attention may be drawn to another aspect of the sporangiophore
of the Psilotaceze which, while consistent with their axial nature, suggests that these
organs are built on an essentially verticillate plan.
