While


the longer time series will aid our efforts in this regard, there is little doubt that our understanding
of the MOC variability will rely on an integrated measure of that variability. In other words, there
are (at least not yet) no obvious proxies for the MOC variability or, for that matter, there are
no obvious proxies for variability in deep water formation. In fact, over the OSNAP period we
have learned that proxies for overturning and those for deep water formation can lead us astray
[72]. In hindsight, we now understand the simple fact that to capture the mean and variability of
the formation and export of deep waters across the subpolar North Atlantic, we need integrated
observations for both. We do not see any short-cuts at this point.
