17â€”21 will show the gradual
increase of moisture in a cubic foot of air from the most dry month, February, until
June or July. Hence the moistness remains nearly stationary until the beginning of
October, when it diminishes, s0mewhat rapidly and regularly, until February. It might be supposed that the hottest months in the year, March, April, and May,
would also be the driest ; but such is not the fact. The powerful action of the sun
on the ocean in the middle of March raises a large quantity of aqueous vapour, which
continues to.increase in the ratio of the sun's progress north. The westerly winds
waft this aqueous vapour into Dukhun : much of it is arrested by the Ghats and
hilly tracts eastward of those hills; accounting for the sensible moistness of the air,
the frequent night-fogs, and deposition of dew on this line in the end of March and
in all April and May.
