‘The apparent
existence of a second coincidence (an increase of the number of drops when %./v,
exceeds 1°31) is still harder to explain on this view. It is possible that condensation in these cases really does take place on ions
carrying the same charge as those produced by Réntgen rays. ‘There are, in fact,
several ways in which we may account for the fact that an electric field does not
remove them, :

We might suppose that the nuclei differ from those produced by Réntgen rays
merely in being so much larger, that their velocity in a given field is diminished
enormously, the charge in each nucleus remaining the same. It is difficult, however,
to believe that the efficiency of the nucleus in helping condensation would remain

unaltered by such an inerease in size as would reduce the velocity to anything like
such a small value as 1/4000 centim.
