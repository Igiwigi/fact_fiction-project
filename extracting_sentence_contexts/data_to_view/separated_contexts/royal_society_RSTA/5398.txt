where jy = curl hy is the distribution of fictitious electric current which produces the

same induction as the intrinsic magnetisation phy, and J is, as before, the real current. It is now quasi-electromagnetic force that acts on an intrinsic magnet, with,

however, the force due to yu, since a magnet has usually large » compared with air. FLUXES OF ENERGY IN THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD.
