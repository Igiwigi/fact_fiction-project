The egg is now
a little over x45 of an inch in diameter. Tt is surrounded by branched connective-
tissue corpuscles, some three or four of which are closely applicd to it. By simple plasmic
nutrition (that is, by assimilation of matters which reach it by osmotic action from the
blood) the egg-corpuscle now increases in size, especially that part of it which we
called the body, and which now begins to assume the. characteristics of an egg-yelk,
viz. in the fact that it is taking on a special and excessive growth. With this increase
of 8ize, it is to be observed that the egg has acquired a more definite envelope (fig. 15, oc.). The egg continues to increase in bulk, and the © body ” relatively more 80 than does
the nucleus, the nucleolus of which has now become broken down.
