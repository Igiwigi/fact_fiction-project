A second way of denying probabilistic representations can
be extracted from recent debates concerning the aims and
claims of Bayesian models [81,82]. When confronted with
worries about computational tractability, departures from
optimality, etc. proponents of Bayesian models sometimes
reply that they are operating at Marr’s computational level,
specifying the problem that some system needs to solve.
Even if the computational-level characterization involves prob-
abilistic representations, this is not required of the algorithmic
implementation, so long as it is approximately input-output
equivalent in ecologically valid circumstances to the Bayesian
decision-theoretic model [83-85]. If the algorithm in fact
does not involve probabilistic representations, then the denial
of probabilistic representations follows so long as elements
posited only at the computational level are not ‘psychologically
real’. This allows for real probability at the algorithmic level,
but in such cases it would concern only the probabilistic tran-
sitions among the non-probabilistic representations. One
might then speak of probabilistic transitions as ‘implicitly
representing’ probabilities [86], but those who argue that
laws governing transitions among representations are not
themselves representations would suggest that this courts
confusion [87].
