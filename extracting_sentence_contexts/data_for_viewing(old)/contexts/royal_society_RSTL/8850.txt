O12) 'The equation (0, 1, 3)=0 merely shows that P, must lie on the same
curve ; OG this equation (0, 2, 3) shows that, if P, be taken arbitrarily on the curve in
question, P, will lie at one of a finite number of points on the curye. In fact, if we
take U,=0 as the condition that P, shall lie on the surface, (0, 1, 3)=0 as the equa-
tion expressing the condition that P, shall lie on the curve, and (0, 2, 3) the addi-
tional condition for contact at P,, we shall have three equations each of the degree 1
for determining the coordinates of P,, The number of positions for P, will therefore

apparently be 1; but this number doubtless admits of some reduction in consequence of
the particular form of the equations. In fact, if a,b .. be the coefficients of the highest
powers of ,, y,, . . in the equation 3"=0, then the terms involving @, 3, .. in (18) all
vanish. But I have not as yet fully investigated this question.

Turning to the second view of the case, which is in fact the more interesting, viz.
that in which (18) is to be considered as a relation between the coefficients of U, we
have for every point of contact four equations, viz.

U=0, ®,U: ®,U : ,,U=d,V : ®,V : d,V, V=0,
