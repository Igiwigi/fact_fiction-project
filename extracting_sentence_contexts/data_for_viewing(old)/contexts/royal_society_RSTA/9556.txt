The great point of difference between the theory of Exystern and that of Desye
lies in the fact that the latter takes into account all frequencies from 0 to v,.

The distribution of the different frequencies given by equation (14) appears to be
capable of deduction from different standpoints, as shown by the researches* of Born
and V, KARMAN,

CALLENDAR has drawn our attention to one important difficulty of the quantum
theory which is mentioned by ExnstTEry, namely, that for large values of e*!", but
a small proportion of the atoms could have even one quantum, When /)/T = 3 (as
for iron at T = 130°C. abs., but one molecule in twenty could have a single
quantum. Even at 100°C. it would be only one in three. PxancK has
endeavoured to avoid this by a more recent and artificial proof which has not
received much support.
