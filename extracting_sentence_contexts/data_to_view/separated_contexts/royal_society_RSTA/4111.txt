The challengeâ€™s acuity is reflected
in the various radical moves it has elicited from the rival interpretations of QM. Among these,
two famous schools have resorted to the following opposite extremes:

(i) Abandonment of ontology: Copenhagen. Since counterfactuals are facts of our knowledge,
just like actual facts, let us define QM as dealing only with knowledge, information, etc.,
rather than with objective reality.

(ii) Excess ontology: Many Worlds. The counterfactual does occur, but in a different world, split
from ours at the instant of measurement. Our option is moderate ontology.
